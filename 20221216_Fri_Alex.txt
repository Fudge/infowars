[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:53.000]  Awaiting the hour of the prize note, the globalist time slips away.
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Friday, December 16 worldwide transmission.
[01:00.000 --> 01:09.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours ahead of the vaunted war room with the great Owen Schroeder.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  The last three hours were very power packed with the amazing Harrison Smith and American Journal.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  Okay, here's what we've got going on for you today.
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.000]  We have quite the lineup of information we're going to be breaking down.
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  We have some really good news, some really bad news, some really incredible news, some really ugly news.
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  But the first thing I want to get to is the unprecedented level of gaslighting going on and also how we're held hostage by the globalist.
[01:38.000 --> 01:50.000]  Not just here, but in Europe, as they fully dissolve the borders and then say, well, sign a deal bringing in hundreds of millions of people and then we'll stop the human trafficking and the illegal destruction of the border.
[01:50.000 --> 01:58.000]  So you can have the legal annihilation of the border or you can have the extra judicial illegal destruction of the border.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  And I love how they keep saying, oh, Biden's done a great job.
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  The corporate media, the White House Press Secretary, he really has controlled the border.
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  It's the safest it's ever been when it is basically gone and the crimes against humanity taking place there and the mass smuggling of kidnapped children.
[02:13.000 --> 02:24.000]  It is so unprecedented, it is so gargantuan, so behemoth that it hobbles the mind just to even face these levels of crimes.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  But it's part of the course as they desensitize this.
[02:26.000 --> 02:35.000]  And then I remember that clip of Biden in the debates saying, look, as soon as I'm elected, immediately surge the border.
[02:35.000 --> 02:43.000]  So then I have the question, why did the Republicans try to impeach him before and now they have control of the House?
[02:43.000 --> 02:44.000]  They better do it.
[02:44.000 --> 02:52.000]  I would imagine they're going to sit there with their thumbs firmly, you know where here is the latest BS from the White House.
[02:52.000 --> 03:01.000]  What Americans should know is that the president has done has done the work to deal with what we're seeing at the border since day one.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  Since day one, let's go ahead and remind folks of what Biden said.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  He said it over and over again in one of those rare moments of truth.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  He said, as soon as I'm elected, immediately surge the border.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  Here it is.
[03:13.000 --> 03:14.000]  I have served with him.
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.000]  They deserve to be heard.
[03:27.000 --> 03:28.000]  That's who we are.
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  We are where a nation says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[03:33.000 --> 03:41.000]  But they're not fleeing oppression of the average American person or even people in their own country.
[03:41.000 --> 03:56.000]  They're fleeing from the IMF World Bank, WEF policies where they had two years plus of lockdowns destroying the third world from Latin America to Africa to the Middle East to poorer areas of Asia, which is the UN plan.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  So that's all coming up today.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  The Federal Reserve has raised rates again.
[04:01.000 --> 04:07.000]  We'll be getting into that massive new news on the Ukraine, Russia, US, NATO proxy war.
[04:07.000 --> 04:20.000]  Massive news on miscarriage is just exploding of women that take the mRNA shots with the actual studies versus government operatives and corporate operatives outlying saying not one woman's ever had a problem ever.
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.000]  Why?
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.000]  In our whole city of Pittsburgh, not one woman's had a miscarriage, which is just a total lie.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  Just like, oh, if you take the shot, you're totally protected.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  You can't get sick and you can't spread it.
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  Lies, lies, lies, lies.
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.000]  Big broadcast lined up today and wide open phone calls throughout the transmission.
[04:40.000 --> 04:48.000]  Infowars.com, band.video or the coordinates of Liberty to override the AI, to override the sensors.
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.000]  That's where it's all really going on. You've got to share those links like the future of Liberty and your freedom depends on it because it does.
[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  We together, all of us, the listeners and viewers are the tip of the spear.
[05:01.000 --> 05:09.000]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[05:09.000 --> 05:20.000]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  But these products work great for women as well.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD. It's the number one natural best seller under another name.
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  We got it discounted for 40% off Infowars.com under the label, Infowars Platinum.
[05:33.000 --> 05:41.000]  We've also got HGH Max Boost. Read all about it. Be very safe with it. I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  Don't do it during the day.
[05:43.000 --> 05:54.000]  1776 testosterone boost. Totally incredible. Go read about them. Learn more about them at InfowarsStore.com in the Infowars Platinum section.
[05:54.000 --> 06:04.000]  And you get 40% off on these already best selling products under the new name Infowars Platinum.
[06:24.000 --> 06:53.000]  Well, if you'll remember right before the midterms, Obama or his meat puppet, O Biden announced that the pandemic was over and they had defeated covid and everything was going to be fine.
[06:53.000 --> 07:02.000]  And it wasn't hard to predict that as soon as they'd stolen the election, they would say, oh my goodness, sorry, it never ended.
[07:02.000 --> 07:11.000]  And now we have the White House, press secretary and other spokespersons here in the list of clips that we're going to be playing saying, oh, the pandemic never ended.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  In fact, it's worse than ever. And we got to have masks and lockdowns and four shots again.
[07:16.000 --> 07:25.000]  The same thing's been announced. Australia and New Zealand and the Europe and Canada, it's all coordinated by the globalist.
[07:25.000 --> 07:32.000]  Talk about incredible deception and Fauci's crawled back out from under his rock.
[07:32.000 --> 07:46.000]  Has the calls at the state and federal level called for his indictment for gain of function, lying to Congress, just every form of criminal activity you can imagine that a little mad scientist, demonic elf is involved in.
[07:46.000 --> 08:01.000]  He's back out saying, well, it never really ended and we're going into year three of it because you didn't submit enough and you didn't take the poison shots that erase your immune system and make you four times more likely to be hospitalized or die.
[08:01.000 --> 08:16.000]  Real numbers, but you notice whether you're in Europe or whether you're in New Zealand or whether you're in the US or Canada, they have the same government spokesperson types, reading off the same script, but just with localized numbers.
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  So Stephen Colbert says, we saved three million lives.
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  We stopped 18 million hospitalizations and it's just a made up number.
[08:25.000 --> 08:32.000]  Fauci, same thing, we saved three million lives in America, stopped 18 million hospitalizations.
[08:32.000 --> 08:40.000]  And it's just like all those other compilations you've seen online where they'll show first one reporter saying something, then another, then another.
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.000]  They're even on different networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, local TV.
[08:47.000 --> 08:58.000]  And then soon there's 40 boxes on the screen all saying the same thing. They're not reporters, they're repeaters and they're everywhere saying there are no microcarditis.
[08:58.000 --> 09:05.000]  There are no heart attacks. There are no blood clots. There are no miscarriages. There are no problems.
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  And they're even back saying it's 100% effective.
[09:09.000 --> 09:23.000]  Meanwhile, I have stacks of the fine print from the New England Medical Journal, the British Medical Journal, local doctors reporting what they're seeing when they do, they try to take their licenses, that the miscarriages are off the charts.
[09:23.000 --> 09:31.000]  And I actually have government statistics on it directly from the government that we're going to be showing you coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[09:31.000 --> 09:40.000]  So this is a lot bigger than just COVID, a lot bigger than new lockdowns, a lot bigger than just the tens of millions of estimated that have been killed by the deadly shots.
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.000]  And they're now saying, oh, it's a super flu. Oh, it's a new super virus. All these people are dying.
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.000]  And almost all of them have been vaccinated with a system that erases your immune system.
[09:51.000 --> 10:04.000]  The holy grail of these bio weapons they've been developing, Fauci, is heavily connected to the development of HIV. You've done your research. That's definitely a U.S. government bio weapon tied into the depopulationist.
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.000]  Fauci and all these people have been looking for something that kills the immune system.
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  And after one shot, depending on the study, but they're all very similar, they've got them in Canada, the U.S., and in the U.K. that I've seen.
[10:18.000 --> 10:28.000]  The first shot, about half of a certain type of white blood cell that's critical in the immune system get turned off.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  It's funny. They don't die. They just stop doing their job and just sit there. White blood cells are produced in your bone marrow.
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.000]  They're the policemen, the military. They go around running the checkpoints and dobbling up the pathogens.
[10:46.000 --> 10:53.000]  And the second shot, by the third shot, your white blood cells are basically turned off.
[10:53.000 --> 11:03.000]  Now HIV did a little something different. It went in and killed T lymphocytes.
[11:03.000 --> 11:12.000]  So there's different types of white blood cells. One white blood cell goes out and trains the other white blood cells on what to do.
[11:12.000 --> 11:24.000]  And so if those key white blood cells get killed, which HIV does, then there's nobody there to train the rest of your blood cells, the other white blood cells.
[11:24.000 --> 11:37.000]  The generals are taken out. This doesn't do that. It just turns them off amongst a whole bunch of other horrible stuff.
[11:37.000 --> 11:48.000]  So they're busy flooding the zone with all their fake studies to counter the real studies. And who funded a bunch of these studies?
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  Who funded over a hundred rigged studies?
[11:52.000 --> 12:09.000]  Oh, FTX, run by the whole Harvard Globalist Mafia, hooked in with the Securities Exchange Commission head. They put tens of millions of dollars in in the last two and a half years, flooding the zone with fake studies.
[12:09.000 --> 12:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's the reality that we're living under.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  That's the reality we're dealing with. And I'm going to go to all those clips and more when we come back.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  Fauci saying the pandemic never ended. Biden saying the pandemic never ended. We have a clip of him saying it did end.
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  Clips of Biden saying, oh, you take the shot. You're a hundred percent protected and you can't give it to people.
[12:37.000 --> 12:51.000]  Rachel Maddow, all of it to remind you of their lives. And then I'm going to go over the actual studies and the actual admitted raw numbers on miscarriages, excess deaths, you name it.
[12:51.000 --> 13:05.000]  But it's in mainline insurance company actuaries, mainline global actuaries societies, all over the news that there's a 13% on average global increase in excess deaths.
[13:05.000 --> 13:19.000]  Never before seen in any time, since we've had recorded statistics the last 200 years, no one has ever seen anything like this.
[13:19.000 --> 13:27.000]  And of course, Biden also said the pandemic was over a few months before the election. And now he says it never went away.
[13:27.000 --> 13:37.000]  And now Bill Gates is drilling for a new deadly virus. He says it's about to be released any moment that targets children. That's all coming up here today.
[13:37.000 --> 13:50.000]  And I would encourage listeners with all the insanity that's going on and all these people that have taken these poison shots that are incubators for all these new superbugs that are being produced to really get as much clean, pure water as you can.
[13:50.000 --> 14:08.000]  And to take your supplements and to get sunlight if you can, and to absolutely try to stay away from freshly injected people because it's in major studies that for at least a month, they are sloughing huge amounts of spike protein off onto you that can infect you.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  That's a definite fact. Dr. McCullough has talked about the studies. It is a reality.
[14:12.000 --> 14:25.000]  So I'm not one of these germophobes or one of these people, you know, running around scared. I'm just telling you that if you know somebody just took a shot or they're wearing one of these masks, it's really just a dirty diaper of germs.
[14:25.000 --> 14:35.000]  I would still just keep your distance from those people because they really are giant germ factories. And this is a lot of serious crap going on and record level death right now.
[14:35.000 --> 14:44.000]  Of course, after the shots, whole new magic viruses are killing everybody. No, you injected people with something that annihilates their immune system.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  So that's all coming up.
[14:46.000 --> 14:59.000]  And I would encourage folks to support the broadcast and keep the show on the air and support your immune system all in one shot at infowarstore.com with the vitamin D3 gummies with vitamin mineral fusion, all the vitamins, all the minerals, the amino acids,
[14:59.000 --> 15:07.000]  DNA Force Plus, Ultra 12, the highest quality organic B12 taken out of the tongue. So good for your energy, the way you feel and your immune system.
[15:07.000 --> 15:18.000]  These are all amazing products. And if folks take them, the numbers, the statistics, the studies are out there, what it does for your cells and your natural defense system.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  So everybody should give themselves the gift of boosting their health and overall well-being and immune system this Christmas.
[15:23.000 --> 15:33.000]  And to give it to friends and family with our great vitamin C zinc combo that has the Linus Pauling recommended 1100% from rose hips and the zinc for better upload.
[15:33.000 --> 15:43.000]  We also have the great multivitamin. We have the great D3 gummies with calcium for better upload, all of it 50% off at infowarstore.com and selling out quick.
[15:43.000 --> 15:56.000]  And we have the new line of info wars MD with our 95% of cumanoid turmeric 95, which is the same as bodies. The bodies that sold out to me five is in stock at infowarstore.com.
[15:56.000 --> 16:13.000]  We'll be right back. There's a war against our masculinity. There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[16:13.000 --> 16:26.000]  But through mother nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done. And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer now.
[16:26.000 --> 16:34.000]  We've never put anything out this powerful. It's info wars platinum now exclusively available at 40% off at infowarstore.com.

[20:32.000 --> 20:38.000]  And I think I'm going to give the crew off tomorrow. I'm not going to do a special Saturday show, but I may post some reports.
[20:38.000 --> 20:47.000]  Okay, it'll take this segment and the next to get through all the poison shot news and then I'm going to move on. Everything else will open the phones up for the balance of broadcasting and all the other news.
[20:47.000 --> 20:58.000]  But this is really important because we've got them caught just on every point and it's life-saving to have this info and then later take clips out of the show and share it with everybody you know.
[20:58.000 --> 21:13.000]  Because it's our responsibility to stop these monsters. Here they are in great doublespeak right out of 1984. Yesterday at the White House, we'll just hear it for yourself saying, well, Biden said the pandemic was over.
[21:13.000 --> 21:20.000]  Well, he also said it isn't over. Oh, so two opposite ideas at the same time. And don't think of that as an oxymoron. Here it is.
[21:20.000 --> 21:30.000]  Back in September, the president publicly said that the pandemic is over. How has that complicated the messaging to keep Americans vigilant facing COVID?
[21:30.000 --> 21:45.000]  Yes, I think the president was also very clear that COVID is not over. Could COVID continue to pose a challenge for us? That is true. COVID is not over. And obviously, we continue to see people getting infected, getting sick. Unfortunately, too many Americans needlessly dying of COVID.
[21:45.000 --> 21:56.000]  And so I think the president has been very clear on this even since that day about the importance of getting vaccinated, people getting treated. And obviously, I've been making that same message.
[21:56.000 --> 22:09.000]  Mr. President, first Detroit Auto Show in three years. Yeah. Is the pandemic over? The pandemic is over. We still have a problem with COVID. We're still doing a lot of work on it.
[22:09.000 --> 22:22.000]  It's what the pandemic is over. If you notice, no one's wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it's changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it.
[22:22.000 --> 22:31.000]  So they're like, well, the public's woken up to us. Let's just claim it's over and then turn it right back on, which they've turned all the same fear, all the same lies back on again.
[22:31.000 --> 22:42.000]  Here's the White House COVID coordinator, the guy that says we were given two arms to take at least two shots. Now they want to take six COVID shots a year. The worst flu outbreak we've seen in a decade. Here he is.
[22:42.000 --> 22:54.000]  You know, flu is rising in many parts of the country. We're probably the worst flu outbreak we've seen in a decade. And there are some places where flu may be peaking, but it's very early data.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  But a lot of flu out there, again, the worst in a decade.
[22:57.000 --> 23:12.000]  Now, everybody remembers in 2000, 2001, not just here, but all the world, because the same UN bodies run the fake statistics. There was basically zero flu. They went from tens of millions of flu deaths to basically zero.
[23:12.000 --> 23:23.000]  Remember that flu? You can type in the headlines. The flu is gone. Why is the flu gone? Because they counted the flu deaths in 2020 to scare everybody as COVID.
[23:23.000 --> 23:34.000]  All that they've taken the poison shots and death rates and all these other viral infections and erased immune systems are so bad. Oh, now it's the flu.
[23:34.000 --> 23:51.000]  Now it's the flu. So here's Fauci explaining that we're in our third year. We took his poison shots, the public on average rolled over, and it's just 100% statement effective. But all these people have got COVID or got the flu or sick or RSV. Here he is.
[23:51.000 --> 24:02.000]  Here we are going into the third year of it. And we are still in the middle of a pandemic with the numbers that you just showed.
[24:02.000 --> 24:12.000]  Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable that they've been getting away with this level of garbage.
[24:12.000 --> 24:28.000]  Now let's play clip 13. This is Fauci attacking DeSantis and putting out the exact same fake numbers that everybody else is putting out from the corporate shell operation that they saved 3 million lives and 18 million hospitalizations.
[24:28.000 --> 24:35.000]  Now just a month ago, they were saying they saved 2 million lives, but now they've up to 3.2 just completely pulled out of the air. Here it is.
[24:35.000 --> 24:45.000]  So politicized as COVID-19. I mean, you've found yourself, we've talked about this many times at the center of some of that angry debate. Elon Musk just came at you and attacked you.
[24:45.000 --> 25:02.000]  But the latest now, Dr. Fauci, is Florida Governor Rhonda Santos. He's now asking the Florida Supreme Court to green light an investigation into, and the way he put it, is any and all wrongdoing in Florida with respect to COVID-19 vaccines.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  What's your reaction to that?
[25:05.000 --> 25:17.000]  I don't have a clue, Kate, what he's asking for. I mean, we have a vaccine that unequivocally is highly effective and safe and has saved literally millions of lives.
[25:17.000 --> 25:39.000]  The Commonwealth Fund has come out with a report just this past week that vaccinations that have been administered over this period of time, this last year and a half to two years, has saved 3.2 million lives, 18 million hospitalizations, and approximately $1 trillion in costs.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  So what's the problem with vaccines?
[25:42.000 --> 25:54.000]  It's not a vaccine. It wasn't approved. It's not safe and effective. It doesn't protect you. It erases your immune system. Everyone knows it. And he just went back to the lie of two years ago that it's safe and effective and protects you.
[25:54.000 --> 26:04.000]  You are a lying, dirtbag criminal that produced the weapon and then released it and then gave us the deadly shots. And you need to go to prison, you little Joseph Mengele.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  Now, here's Colbert, again, reading the same talking points.
[26:09.000 --> 26:16.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to the Late Show. I'm your host, Stephen Colbert, and we are just one month, one month.
[26:16.000 --> 26:23.000]  We are one month past the 2022 election, which means we are deep into the 2024 election.
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.000]  We've already got so many fantastic candidates to choose from, from the old guy with a red tie to the old guy with a blue tie.
[26:30.000 --> 26:42.000]  But there's one slightly less old guy making a name for himself in the GOP. It's Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, seen here with, let's say, his Miami caught in a vice.
[26:42.000 --> 26:53.000]  New Wall Street Journal poll says that in a hypothetical GOP primary matchup, DeSantis beats the former president 52% to 38%.
[26:53.000 --> 27:05.000]  Yay. Also, maybe boo. It's hard to know who to root for here. It's like a poll between gonorrhea and a slightly more racist gonorrhea.
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  This is...apologies to gonorrhea.
[27:11.000 --> 27:19.000]  This is all because, what with the insurrections and the Hitler dinners, only the most conservative voters are still backing the ex-president,
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.000]  while DeSantis is trouncing him with voters who consider themselves only somewhat conservative.
[27:25.000 --> 27:32.000]  Basically, the folks who don't support gay marriage, but think Andy Cohen does a great job handling those housewives.
[27:32.000 --> 27:45.000]  So, to take full command of the GOP, all DeSantis has to do is reel in the coveted conservative demographic of angry conspiracy QAnon all-meet diet-tannier testicle boys.
[27:45.000 --> 27:54.000]  And his opening offer to all of them is calling for a grand jury investigation of COVID vaccines.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  You stupid Motherfizer.
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  You want an investigation? Let me save you some time and money.
[28:02.000 --> 28:10.000]  In the U.S. alone, the COVID vaccines have saved more than 3 million lives and helped prevent...
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  Did you say so?
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.000] ...prevent 18.5 million hospitalizations.
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  And, if that's not enough.
[28:19.000 --> 28:29.000]  And, because idiots in your party politicized the vaccine almost twice as many Republicans died from COVID before the midterms, then the Democrats...
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[28:31.000 --> 28:42.000]  No, we have an absolute key report by Greg Rees a year ago with the government's own documents showing that they sent the hot batches to predominantly conservative areas of the country.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  Yes, targeting with the bioweapon vaccine.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  That's how they did that. We have it all documented.
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  Alright, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  I'm going to come back and get into some good news, but also the bad news, the miscarriages.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  Stay with us.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  I want you to remember two words.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  InfoWars Platinum.
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  In the history of InfoWars supplements, and they're amazing.
[29:09.000 --> 29:15.000]  This is hands down the most powerful game-changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[29:15.000 --> 29:23.000]  Now, all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a pharmaceutical company that also makes high-end supplements.
[29:23.000 --> 29:30.000]  And the owner's a listener and a supporter, so they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores.
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.000]  Over 20% off what they're sold online under the InfoWars Platinum brand name.
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  These are incredible.
[29:37.000 --> 29:43.000]  Paying MD, HGH Max Boost, and of course 1776, testosterone boost.
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  Read about them at infowarsstore.com, learn about them, and then try them out for yourself.
[29:48.000 --> 29:57.000]  And I know you will be a repeat customer, which is awesome. It will empower your life, make your life more amazing, and it will keep us on the air a 360 win.
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.000]  InfoWars Platinum, now available at infowarsstore.com.
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[30:05.000 --> 30:17.000]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  These are high-end. These are the very best.
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  You know our body's Ultimate Turmeric formula is amazing?
[30:22.000 --> 30:28.000]  Well, guess what? We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[30:31.000 --> 30:38.000]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact, high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[30:38.000 --> 30:43.000]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at infowarsstore.com.
[30:43.000 --> 30:53.000]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[30:53.000 --> 30:56.000]  InfoWars MD at infowarsstore.com.
[31:00.000 --> 31:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars Live products have always been the highest quality, triple-tested, and you've seen the rave reviews.
[31:07.000 --> 31:18.000]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[31:18.000 --> 31:27.000]  So we've gone directly to the stores and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high-quality supplements and in some cases even better.
[31:27.000 --> 31:33.000]  Introducing InfoWars MD at infowarsstore.com.
[31:33.000 --> 31:45.000]  InfoWars MD exclusively at infowarsstore.com has 10 new products, turmeric 95, libido RX, better mood, nitric boost, much room max, anetropic,
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  ankles fatality collagen, superfood greens, and more.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  Just taking superfood greens.
[31:51.000 --> 31:58.000]  This is the highest quality greens out there and it's at a price way, way lower than the same product on store shelves for up to twice the cost.
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  Find InfoWars MD at InfoWars Store.
[32:00.000 --> 32:07.000]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible.
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.000]  The only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible.
[32:11.000 --> 32:21.000]  The only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible.
[32:21.000 --> 32:30.000]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive law fair being waged against InfoWars,
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.000]  despite the media defamatory libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[32:34.000 --> 32:43.000]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air
[32:43.000 --> 32:50.000]  and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  So continue to do it. Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  Go to places like Save InfoWars.
[32:55.000 --> 33:01.000]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[33:01.000 --> 33:21.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:21.000 --> 33:32.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:32.000 --> 33:40.000]  All right, I should have done this right at the start of the show because it's really important to understand the Globalist Master Plan and why they do what they do.
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.000]  And you would only have this understanding if you were at the highest levels of their operations or if you'd been immersed in this for 30 years
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  and become very prominent and then able to talk to a lot of these people.
[33:51.000 --> 33:59.000]  But I have talked to high-level CIA, I have talked to Chris Carter, I have talked to a lot of key people in different positions
[33:59.000 --> 34:08.000]  and was able to ask them questions about different things I saw over the years and I got similar answers from them.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  And so I'm going to tell you about that next segment.
[34:11.000 --> 34:21.000]  But what is predictive programming? Why are they doing it? Why do they have an X-Files episode called My Struggle Part 2 in 2016
[34:21.000 --> 34:32.000]  where the government rolls out a virus for fear but gives people a shot that goes in and attacks the double helix and turns off your immune system?
[34:32.000 --> 34:42.000]  Well, Chris Carter later said that he'd been approached by the CIA on certain episodes and asked to put those into the show.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  And I'm going to tell you about a few of those.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  Now, I was told this by people that worked with Carter, later had a chance to talk to him some.
[34:47.000 --> 34:56.000]  He then came out and said favorable things about me in 2016 and then for several years more and I never got a chance to go out and meet with him in Los Angeles
[34:56.000 --> 35:06.000]  but it's not about name dropping the creator of X-Files. It's about that window into things that nobody else has been able to have.
[35:06.000 --> 35:14.000]  So this is the intersection of the deep state, Hollywood, and then Alex Jones being able to decipher it.
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.000]  This is big, okay? And when we play this short compilation from the episode, you're going to be blown away.
[35:20.000 --> 35:30.000]  I was on Twitter last night doing some research and doing some searches on the virus and this new virus that obviously Bill Gates is cooking up in the new drills.
[35:30.000 --> 35:37.000]  And boom, I saw this episode clip and I never was a big TV watcher of entertainment.
[35:37.000 --> 35:47.000]  So I've never watched a lot of X-Files until 2016 when they said the main character who was the talk show host was based on Alex Jones because Carter said that.
[35:47.000 --> 35:55.000]  So I did watch some of these episodes and why were they telling us this just a few years before it actually got released?
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  So this is a big deal that's coming up next segment.
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  But I want to hit the miscarriage news and the other news that's so important to save lives first.
[36:03.000 --> 36:11.000]  That said, I told you we made some major breakthroughs in the last year, some huge breakthroughs.
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.000]  And we got through the middlemen, big supplement companies to the actual mass producers.
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  So we have the M4 Wars MD line, already 10 new products that are out.
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  The CBDs amongst the highest quality out there at prices up to 50% off.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  What you would get these name brands for that we are allowed to private label.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  So we sold out of the 10 milligram CBD.
[36:30.000 --> 36:37.000]  We have the 25 milligram and the 1000 milligram still on sale at m4warstore.com.
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  But those are about to sell out.
[36:40.000 --> 36:46.000]  A lot of the other ones aren't about to sell out like Mushroom Max and 295 that are excellent and Labita RX and more.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  Now that's one big company.
[36:48.000 --> 36:56.000]  This company is a patriot owned, it's not the largest, it's not even medium sized, but it's big.
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  It's a large independent pharmaceutical company also makes some of the top supplements in the country.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  And the owner is a listener.
[37:03.000 --> 37:10.000]  We just did this by canvassing and learning the industry even more and battling through supply chain problems and everything made it stronger.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  We were able to come out with their three number one best selling products.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  They've got hundreds of products.
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  They've got more than 10 that are number one best sellers.
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.000]  But these are the first three.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  These are already been used for several years.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  They're already number one best sellers under another name.
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.000]  And when we talk about pain MD with natural compounds for pain management and more.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  This sells for $87 in stores.
[37:35.000 --> 37:42.000]  We're selling it for 40% off at infowarstore.com under pain MD.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  Unbelievable.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  1776 testosterone boost.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  I came up with that name.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  It's under another name.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  It's number one best seller.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  GAMPAC absolutely will improve your well life.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  Amazing.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  This is the Rolls Royce of quality.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  This is $100 online or in stores.
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  We're selling it for 40% off.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  And then this.
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  Consult your physician before you take any of this because these are the strongest supplements out there.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  They're the real deal.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  I mean, these are like powerful.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  HGH max boost.
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  Most of the crews taking it.
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  I've taken it.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  Everything we do, you know, we take and test first ourselves even though it's already been tested to number one seller.
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  You take this before you go to bed because what it does in your cells is makes you get the craziest sleepover.
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  You better be ready to sleep 10 hours because it doesn't have any type of sleeping agent in it.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  What it does in your cells is make them reboot.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  Okay.
[38:38.000 --> 38:43.000]  You need to go read about the ingredients and find out about yourself because if I talked about it, it would take an hour to explain.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  But I'm just telling you, you should take a quarter of what they say the dose is the first few times.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  Okay.
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.000]  Because it's that powerful what it does in your cells and it's incredible.
[38:53.000 --> 38:59.000]  I have friends and family that are basically insomniacs and I know lawyers have become insomniacs because they work so much.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  They stay up so many nights.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  You get to where your body is used to that.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  I know people that take, you know, all sorts of stuff trying to sleep.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  It doesn't work.
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.000]  Herbs help a little bit.
[39:06.000 --> 39:07.000]  We've got the best herbs out there.
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  But this HGH max isn't even advertised to make you sleep.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  That's what it does.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  So this is a serious reboot.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  It's not a game and it's very powerful.
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  Okay.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  So it's 40% off as well.
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  This is sold for $100 in stores all day long.
[39:23.000 --> 39:30.000]  The ingredients are very expensive, but you're getting it 40% off in the Info Wars Platinum line.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  Info Wars Platinum line.
[39:35.000 --> 39:41.000]  We're very, very blessed and very, very honored to have these breakthroughs.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  We're able to bring in these products and it keeps the show in the air.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  So believe me.
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.000]  And not just, by the way, not just women can take the testosterone boost.
[39:50.000 --> 39:51.000]  Okay.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  And I'm not going to get into all the mechanics of how it works, but you just need to go read
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  about it for yourself.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  This is good for everybody, but it's obviously marketed and designed for men.
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  But it does all sorts of interesting things, but it's, again, very strong.
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  And so you've been told, okay, we're not selling crap here.
[40:08.000 --> 40:09.000]  We're not playing games here.
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  This is the most powerful, highly rated stuff on the market.
[40:14.000 --> 40:15.000]  So get ready.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  This is next level.
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  Look at the packaging.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  You just see the whole thing is like, it's just next level for us.
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.000]  That's because they did the packaging and that's a pharmaceutical company puts that out.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.000]  Okay.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  But it's over the counter.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  InfoWars Platinum.
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  Yeah.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  The InfoWars MD line is excellent as well.
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Two different top of the line companies.
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  I want to thank God for the major breakthrough of getting these companies.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  Okay.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  Let me do this.
[40:43.000 --> 40:47.000]  The miscarriage news around the world with the poison shots are given is so critical.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  I'm going to get to that next hour.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  I'm going to hit the X files, predicted programming information next segment.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  And then I'm going to get into the Fed raising rates, the JFK documents that got released,
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  Tucker Carlson knocking out of the park with that last night.
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  We're going to get into the major push for pedophilia and arresting people that don't go along with it.
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.000]  In Europe and in the UK, if you will not use pronouns, you're now put in jail.
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.000]  And I have stacks of articles on that.
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.000]  A famous lesbian filmmaker put in her film that only a woman can have a baby defending femininity
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  and that territory of women.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  She has now been arrested.
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  Christian teacher jailed at refusing to use gender, neutral pronouns as told.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  He'll remain behind bars.
[41:33.000 --> 41:39.000]  And anytime he does not use the terms, he'll be given bigger prison sentences.
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  Yes, this is 1984.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  This is maximum tyranny.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  That is coming up as well.
[41:42.000 --> 41:49.000]  But we've also got the good news Senate passes defense bill that repeals military coronavirus vaccine mandate.
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  Republicans release unclassified report proving that it's a man made virus.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  Told you so.
[41:54.000 --> 41:55.000]  Vindicated again.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  We've just got so much more.
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  The alarming increase in non respiratory deaths.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  It's coming to vaccination again.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  New big report on that.
[42:02.000 --> 42:08.000]  We have just got so much that we're going to be going through here today that is beyond essential.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  It is coffin nails to the whole globalist agenda.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  We're non violent offensively.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  We're defensively will protect ourselves.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  That's my view.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  That's my system.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  I'm sure a lot of people agree with me.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  But information is where the real war is happening.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  And we have the truth.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  They have the lies.
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.000]  And so I know the audience already knows most of the stuff, but it's critical to be totally
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  reversed with the documents to warn people it is our responsibility.
[42:35.000 --> 42:42.000]  So that's coming up also the Twitter meltdown with Elon Musk spending CNN so called journalists
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  for doxing people, which I don't agree with and which is against the rules.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  They're completely freaking out after leading all the censorship.
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  They're mad that some of their scumbags are actually having the law enforced on them.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  Stay with us.
[42:56.000 --> 43:05.000]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects.
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.000]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  And now with all the things were bombarded with the water and the food and the feminizing
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.000]  factors.
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  It is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  These products work great for women as well.
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have pain MD.

[44:07.000 --> 44:10.000]  to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[44:10.000 --> 44:16.000]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  about 1 to 2% per year.
[44:18.000 --> 44:26.000]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[45:00.000 --> 45:07.000]  In Arizona I think we watch the election be stolen slowly stolen day by day counting these
[45:07.000 --> 45:13.000]  mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously
[45:13.000 --> 45:20.000]  when we just it's election month Alex it's not election day and that's the problem and
[45:20.000 --> 45:27.000]  everything changed after COVID-19 they illegally changed state elections mailing ballots to
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.000]  anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.000]  Well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have elections
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.000]  that can be stolen like this and I believe that just like I believe the election was
[45:41.000 --> 45:47.000]  stolen in 2020 and I have no problem saying that and it is so absurd for the media and
[45:47.000 --> 45:53.000]  the democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  We're not election deniers we're election realists.

[47:07.000 --> 47:28.000]  All right I'm gonna take you inside Hollywood we take you inside the CIA I'm gonna take
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  you inside the military industrial complex and why they do the things they do as a group
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  of mad scientists that believe in eugenics believe in the transhumanist world government
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.000]  their high priest externalizing the hierarchy of their system is you've all know a Harari
[47:42.000 --> 47:47.000]  right now basically saying everything I warned you of the last 30 years 28 years plus but
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  telling you what's a good thing the end of humanity we're taking over your bodies putting
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  nanotech in your food you can't stop us I didn't know if Chris Carter was good or bad
[47:57.000 --> 48:07.000]  coming back many years ago they had a lone gunman ex file spinoff in early 2021 in early
[48:07.000 --> 48:16.000]  2001 that have been made in late year 2000 and in it a criminal element the government
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.000]  hijacks a jumbo jet to fly it into the World Trade Center to blame it on bin Laden and launch
[48:22.000 --> 48:30.000]  a war in Afghanistan now this airs eight months before 9 11 on Fox entertainment television
[48:30.000 --> 48:41.000]  you can find the lone gunman 9 11 episode is type in lone gunman 9 11 scenario it's on
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  YouTube it's on Twitter it's everywhere most of you are already know about it we've talked
[48:45.000 --> 48:52.000]  about it play the clips probably a hundred times the last 20 years 21 years it's hard
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  to believe that that happened that long ago so I finally got to talk to one of the co-producers
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  of Chris Carter when I was out now and he said no Chris is a big listener we actually like
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  you the CIA comes to us and gives us scripts they gave us this script and wanted Chris to
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.000]  put it in there I said that on air Chris Carter got asked I think by variety or billboard
[49:10.000 --> 49:17.000]  a few months later this is back in 2000 I think with 2002 and Chris said no the CIA came
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  to me basically with part of the script and thought this would be a good script for us
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.000]  of a criminal group in the government hijacking a jet by remote control claiming it's actually
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  Islamic terrorist on board to blame it on bin Laden and I'm not saying bin Laden's good
[49:29.000 --> 49:34.000]  I'm not saying Islamic extremism doesn't exist this is what they wanted put in there so I
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  wanted to really find out more about this and so talked to Chris Carter a few times exchanged
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  some emails he said that come out meet in LA sometime we never did it then he comes out
[49:44.000 --> 49:51.000]  in 2016 with the return of the X-Files if you remember and he said in interviews the
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.000]  main you know character is this talk show host who turns out to be right and he's based
[49:55.000 --> 50:04.000]  on Alex Jones I was pretty flattered and so I did watch those X-Files episodes so in
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.000]  those criminal groups released a bio weapon to basically erase your immune system and
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.000]  take over civilization and society but they even had other episodes right before those
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  came out that also basically had the same plot and I haven't talked to Chris Carter
[50:20.000 --> 50:25.000]  since then but I probably should reach out to him and maybe he'd come on I've been demonized
[50:25.000 --> 50:36.000]  so much maybe he won't now but it was called my struggle part to February 22nd 2016 and
[50:36.000 --> 50:46.000]  in it a criminal group in the government gives the public injections that erase their immune
[50:46.000 --> 50:53.000]  systems and take over their DNA that's now happen for real now the question is why do
[50:53.000 --> 51:02.000]  this and we could talk for an hour about that but it's an esoteric rule of mind control
[51:02.000 --> 51:08.000]  that you've got to tell people what you're going to do to them before they do it because
[51:08.000 --> 51:13.000]  that subconsciously primes the brain to be more comfortable with it when it actually
[51:13.000 --> 51:20.000]  happens it's desensitizing and it does a lot of other things but understand that the reason
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  I've been warning of this bio release and the reason I've been warning they're going
[51:23.000 --> 51:32.000]  to use it to take over society is it's not just the next files it is in the Rockefeller
[51:32.000 --> 51:37.000]  report lot step and others that they would do this exact scenario and get you in world
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  government and a world ID through using this show when I sit up here and everything I keep
[51:41.000 --> 51:47.000]  saying comes true people go man he must be an insider he must he must you know be a bad
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  guy no any of you can see this to any of you can go read this stuff they treat you like
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  animals and that's the rule metaphysically you've got to be warned of what they're going
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.000]  to do like when you post a notice that there's going to be an auction or you know that somebody's
[52:01.000 --> 52:06.000]  going to be having their house repossessed and sold on the courthouse steps there is a
[52:06.000 --> 52:12.000]  rule under common law going back thousands of years Roman common law British common law
[52:12.000 --> 52:18.000]  Jewish common law that you've got to give somebody fair warning before you do it and
[52:18.000 --> 52:23.000]  that's what this is and Chris Carter would agree that that's what's going on I don't
[52:23.000 --> 52:28.000]  think he's a bad guy I don't think he's willingly part of it but he understands the mechanism
[52:28.000 --> 52:33.000]  and is presenting it to you and really warning you he said I think Alex Jones is a good guy
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  I don't think he's a racist I think he's a libertarian I think a lot of what he said has
[52:36.000 --> 52:45.000]  come true he said that in the newspapers in 2016 so it's up to you to decide or not but
[52:45.000 --> 52:56.000]  here's a few minutes from the 2016 my struggle my comp in German part two here it is.
[52:56.000 --> 53:06.000]  Tad O'Malley has been making claims. Claims about what? You and everyone you know has a piece of DNA in your genome put there without your knowing it.
[53:06.000 --> 53:12.000]  By whom? Well that's the question today. This is an internet lunatic you're not saying you believe him.
[53:12.000 --> 53:18.000]  Hold on agent Einstein you're talking to a scientist. Forgive me assistant director it may sound insensitive but the
[53:18.000 --> 53:24.000]  suggestion is pure science fiction. What I'm saying. By the way in pause. Start this over from the beginning.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  In this episode the internet lunatic are talking about is me and Chris Carter says that.
[53:28.000 --> 53:36.000]  So it's a talk show house that you with our set everything saying this maybe a little bit skinnier better looking guy but start the clip over.
[53:36.000 --> 53:46.000]  Tad O'Malley has been making claims. Claims about what? You and everyone you know has a piece of DNA in your genome put there without your knowing it.
[53:46.000 --> 53:52.000]  By whom? Well that's the question today. This is an internet lunatic you're not saying you believe him.
[53:52.000 --> 54:00.000]  Hold on agent Einstein you're talking to a scientist. Forgive me assistant director it may sound insensitive but the suggestion is pure science fiction.
[54:00.000 --> 54:07.000]  What I'm saying agent Einstein is that the facts as I understand them cannot be discounted out of hand.
[54:07.000 --> 54:16.000]  No one has the right or the ability to tamper with your DNA. Unless we gave them that ability.
[54:16.000 --> 54:23.000]  You say they're tampering with our DNA that they're able to shut down our immune systems by the addition of something to our DNA.
[54:23.000 --> 54:28.000]  Yes but I don't know how exactly. How it's being triggered. I don't know that either.
[54:28.000 --> 54:36.000]  Well why it's happening now. What can we possibly do. We need to act quickly. You were right about that.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  Well I was wrong about the science. I was wrong about what's causing it. Dead wrong in fact.
[54:41.000 --> 54:49.000]  But it's clearly a widespread failure of our immune systems. Through gene tampering. A virus within a virus that was put there through the smallpox vaccine.
[54:49.000 --> 54:57.000]  It's what these men are calling the Spartan virus. We have to figure this out. What's wrong with the science.
[54:57.000 --> 55:07.000]  Okay. The Spartan virus removes the xenosine daminase gene from your DNA. It moves the ADA gene and your immune system will simply vanish.
[55:07.000 --> 55:17.000]  Yeah but I'm not getting sick. It's only a matter of time. Okay. So how does it work. How does the virus remove the ADA gene.
[55:17.000 --> 55:27.000]  A process called CRISPR-Cas9. RNA and a protein cutting genes at exact locations. Exactly. But in this instance used as a weapon.
[55:27.000 --> 55:36.000]  The ultimate weapon. The ability to depopulate the planet. To kill everyone but the chosen. By tampering with their DNA.
[55:36.000 --> 55:43.000]  Through gene editing. Why do such a thing lie about it. Oh and government. Your own government lies as a matter of course.
[55:43.000 --> 55:51.000]  As a matter of policy. The Tuskegee experiments on black men in the 30s. Henrietta Lacks. What are they trying to do. That's the missing piece.
[55:51.000 --> 56:00.000]  But it's not hard to imagine a government hiding hoarding technology for 70 years at the expense of human life and the future of the planet.
[56:00.000 --> 56:14.000]  Driven not only by corporate greed but a darker objective. The takeover of America. And then the world itself by any means necessary however violent or cruel or efficient.
[56:14.000 --> 56:24.000]  By severe drought brought on by weather wars conducted secretly using aerial contaminants and high altitude electromagnetic waves in a state of perpetual war.
[56:24.000 --> 56:31.000]  To create problem reaction solution scenarios to distract and rage and enslave American citizens at home.
[56:31.000 --> 56:39.000]  What tools like the Patriot Act and the National Defense Authorization Act which abridged the Constitution in the name of national security.
[56:39.000 --> 56:48.000]  The militarization of police forces in cities across the U.S. The building of prison camps by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with no stated purpose.
[56:48.000 --> 56:59.000]  The corporate takeover of food and agriculture pharmaceuticals and healthcare even the military and clandestine agendas to fat and dull sicken and control a populace already consumed by consumerism.
[56:59.000 --> 57:07.000]  And I encourage you all to go shopping more. A government that taps your phone collects your data and monitors your whereabouts with impunity.
[57:07.000 --> 57:13.000]  A government preparing to use that data against you when it strikes. And the final takeover begins.
[57:13.000 --> 57:21.000]  The takeover of America. By a well-oiled and well-armed multinational group of elites that will cold kill and subjugate.
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.000]  Happening as we sit here. It's happening all around us.
[57:25.000 --> 57:34.000]  The other shoe waiting to drop. It'll probably start on a Friday. The banks will announce a security action necessitating their computers to go offline all weekend.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  Digital money will disappear. They can just seal your money?
[57:37.000 --> 57:47.000]  Followed by the detonation of strategic elections. We'll air the rest of it coming up later. But this is their actual plan. We'll be right back with our number two. Stay with us. Infowars.com.
[58:08.000 --> 58:16.000]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners. The owners are fan. And they've given us this huge deal off of retail.
[58:16.000 --> 58:28.000]  40% off what these products are found for under other names. And not just under one name. They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[58:28.000 --> 58:37.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores. We're talking about Payne MD. We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[58:37.000 --> 58:45.000]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost. These things are incredible. I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do.
[58:45.000 --> 58:59.000]  And consult your healthcare provider. Those are so powerful. Get them at infowarsstore.com.

[59:46.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  Well, Pentagon has publicly green lit the cruise missile attacks inside Russia that have been going on for a week and a half.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  We can see a Russian tank. We can see a Russian APC. We can see a Russian missile get launched. And that information gets fed to the Ukrainians.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  And they could actually act on it almost immediately, which is something I think the Russians never contemplated.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Well, if Putin didn't contemplate that, his intelligence services didn't contemplate that, they're idiots. Because I knew it and I told you that.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  Oh, the spin is when the Russians fire a missile, we give them a live time. Like when Ukraine fired those missiles into Poland to blame it on Putin and try to get a nuclear war going a month ago.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  This is a very dramatic potential escalation, obviously, because Poland is a NATO country. There were ongoing cruise missile attacks being carried out in the west of Ukraine, close to Poland's border at the time that these projectiles landed on Polish territory.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  It is conceivable that they are Russian missiles. I'm not pro-Russia. I'm pro-non-nuclear war. Shall we play a game? How about global thermal nuclear war?
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  And Russia's got its problems and has committed its crimes. But compared to the New World Order, they are amateurs, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  But they've got a giant nuclear weapons arsenal. They're being pushed into a corner and now Putin's threatening nuclear war.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  Russia might as well be fighting Martians right now. The technology's 30, 40 years in advance. Can Russia deploy tens of thousands of one-man team launch? One guy can put two switchblades on his back. And those switchblades can go out and take out multiple Russian vehicles over the top dangerous.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  The Pentagon is greenlit. You've been seeing for two weeks, or 12 days, almost two weeks, daily cruise missile attacks into Russia, blowing up military bases.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  So Putin goes, OK, I may do a first strike with Nukes. I said I wouldn't, but now I may. I mean, this is just huge.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  And now we have strikes at at least three bases inside of Russia.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Exactly. And for him, that is very worrying because now he knows that Ukraine could hit. I mean, we're talking about very close to Moscow, right? This is the center of the Kremlin and the center of Russian economy and power.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, in the year 2022 and everything else, quite frankly, pells in significance. Now, now, why is war already started? Why is more war coming? Because they're at the end of a currency bubble. They need a big global emergency to be able to basically make us forget that this is a giant Ponzi scheme that makes Bernie Madoff and FDX and the tulip mania that, you know, happened 100 years ago, pale in significance.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  Do you hate America?
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  No. You know, in fact, I know many inmates. I figure out we're sharing way more common. Maybe America is very much similar. Look, it's the same size. If they have a, it's the same kind of this.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  And when you talk to them, there is nothing there even to be found. We are naturally, you know, born not to be enemies.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  And whatever this conflict, it's the elites. You know, every, you know, American I met in the prison, who is from rural area, was very easy to deal with.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  She has no problem with Russia, and he was curious about Russia, despite all propaganda. They're losing their Christian values. They're losing their families. They're losing literally their countries.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  You'll be laying in your bed one night. We'll be driving down the highway after work, and there'll be big flashes. You see, and then 10 seconds later, your car is going to be overturned, probably on fire.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  And then life as you know, it's over. You won't get back to your family. There'll be mass starvation and death, and there'll be a new literal dark age with enough dust in the atmosphere to cause a many ice age.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  And they estimate 7 billion people will die in a nuclear war. There'll be maybe 500 million left, which is what these death cult people fetish all day long.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  Info Wars Platinum. Now all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  We've gone right to the manufacturer, who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores. We're talking about Payne MD. We're talking about HGH Max Boost.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost. These things are incredible. I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and consult your healthcare provider because they're so powerful.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  Get them at infowarstore.com.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:14.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  Well, a bunch of the JFK files got released and it shows CIA connections as we already knew. The assassination of President Kennedy. That's some of that coming up. That's really beaten a dead horse, literally and figuratively.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  We have the economic news with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. We have people being arrested all over the place for misgendering folks. Absolute tyranny there.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  They also had a drag queen pedo time event here in Austin two nights ago that Patriot reporters got footage of that do things with children we can't put on air for an adult audience.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  So that'll give you an idea of what's going on. And Instagram banned the videos put out by the drag queen pervert time event saying that it's not even suitable for adult audiences on Instagram.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  Only suitable for children. See how that works? You can't show it. It's so terrible. But children can see it.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  They just had a big school district superintendent have to resign because they had underage students from middle school and high school being given alcohol and other things at a sex themed party with the teachers and administration officials.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  What's the school doing having a sex party with the adults? You imagine them for wars. I said, hey, we're going to have a sex named Christmas party with a skinny clad strip T sex and alcohol.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  And I told my crew, hey, bring your kids along. We're going to have fat men dressed up like women shake their asses in their face. Every one of my employees will quit.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  Of course, I have no desire to do that. But see, well, that's a normal business. You know, you don't even tell a secretary. Oh, your dress looks nice. Why that's harassment.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  Oh, but if you want to have kids in a sexual position and it's liberal, well, then it's okay. This is crazy.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  So we've got a big stack on that front with transgender men who've had giant breast jobs with their breast out in front of three year olds and five year olds in Austin at night at a big party with alcohol.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  With G strings with their slongs bouncing around. That's America.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  That's the stuff that's going on. They want to kill their innocence and they can't kill them in the womb. They want to sterilize them afterwards.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Okay, so first hour. We got into a lot of key news and you see them up there lying saying the vaccine safe and effective again, saying it totally makes you safe. All that's a lie.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  Yeah, we're showing some of the stuff we can show you but I don't think we're going to. I mean, look at this. We're going to get to this later.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  But the cruise going through what we can show and what we can't show. But it's it's it's very sexual, very provocative. And again, just completely perverted.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  I mean, imagine you have a heterosexual bar was having kids in for this stuff. It'd be shut down.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  But we're going to get to more of that coming up here today. What I want to hit now is the situation that we see unfolding with the miscarriages.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  And we have the British numbers. We have the German numbers. We have the Australian numbers. We have the entrance company numbers. We have the Canadian numbers.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  We have the US numbers. We have the numbers. I'll show you some of the studies and reports here in a moment.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  That in the first two trimesters, if women take any of these shots, because even if they're virus vector shots and not mRNA gene therapy, it's all designed to have the same effect create the deadly spike protein in the body that severs the double helix of the cells.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  The opposite of what PQQ and CoQ10 can do help me say together, because when those break, you get cancer. You age, you die.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  In the first two trimesters, an 82% increase, New England Medical Journal, and then a lower percentage death rate, but still huge in the third trimester.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  So the babies are tougher when they've made it up to their seventh, eighth and nine months inside their mother's uterus.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  I'm sorry, birthing person's uterus.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  And we can show you the federal government's own numbers there on screen of miscarriages and stillbirths.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  By year, you can see as soon as the shots introduced, 2021, boom, it's off the chart.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  Then folks get scared, they stop taking it and the number plunges, but still that's 30, 40, 50 times, even as it drops any previous year except for last year.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  And again, TV viewers can see all this radio listeners will be able to find the archive of this live show later at man.video and the live video streams are at infowars.com.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  So every man and woman listening to this should reach out to everybody you know with these reports and with this information and save lives and tell them, hey, you got to warn other people as well and have them warn people.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  That'll override the AI. That'll override the censorship and the control.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  So let's first go back to this Great Mike Adams article that came out in July of last year.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  And it links right to the New England Medical Journal that hides it deep in the study. That's an 82% of pregnant women who got vaccinated for COVID during the first and second trimesters suffered miscarriages.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  And it's still a very, very large amount as well you can read in the third trimester as well. That's also in the double digits.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  So here's one of the studies, preliminary findings of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant women.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  You can go read that for yourself right there at web.archive.org.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  And then we've got this other report here, miscarriage, stillbirth rates exploding worldwide as depopulation continues on the mated.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  You can see the graph there from the federal government's own numbers, similar numbers around the world.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Exposure to COVID vaccine spike proteins renders women infertile.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Scientists warrants, call the links to that right there. Nurse whistleblower, fetal deaths of skyrocketed since pregnant women started using, being forced to get COVID-19 shots.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  Australia sees 63% drop in births after introduction of COVID vaccines. What will the government's excuse will be?
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  And now that leads us to these really evil videos. They're all reading the same talking point, whether it's Australia or whether it's the United States, France, the Netherlands, it's all the same.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  They roll out doctors, and this is the spokesperson for the Pittsburgh Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, hospital president.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  COVID-19 vaccines causing miscarriages is complete myth, plain and simple.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  So he doesn't give any facts, doesn't give any statistics, doesn't give any numbers.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  He just says we have thousands of women and none of them had a problem.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  Well, you can go look in Pittsburgh and see the stillbirths and miscarriages and the numbers are off the chart.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  I mean, everybody knows, even before this was going on, there's still births and miscarriages and babies die.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  No, no, no, there's nobody, nobody's dying. No children are dying. Here's the clip.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  I'm very happy to report that among the tens of thousands of women who have been closely studied after they chose to get the COVID-19 vaccines, the data is clear. These vaccines are safe.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  Hit pause again. This is large. It started over. Where's the study? The tens of thousands of women. Where is it? They admit it's all lies.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  Pfizer fake reports as well. This guy is a lying scumbag. Sorry, play the clip over.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  I'm very happy to report that among the tens of thousands of women who have been closely studied after they chose to get the COVID-19 vaccines, the data is clear. These vaccines are safe.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  This large group of moms to be who received the COVID vaccine over around a year ago and have given birth to thousands of healthy babies without any evidence of negative effects on their pregnancies.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  Similarly, tens of thousands of women have received the COVID-19 vaccine before getting pregnant and have not had any struggles related to infertility whatsoever.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  The often mentioned but completely unsubstantiated concerns about COVID-19 vaccines causing either miscarriages or other problems with their pregnancy or causing problems getting pregnant is a complete myth, plain and simple.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  What is not a myth is the harm that COVID-19 can have on pregnant women and their unborn babies.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  Because of the risk to anyone pregnant and the demonstrated safety record that we now have, the CDC and UPMC recommend these vaccines for all pregnant patients.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  Premier organizations for obstetricians and gynecologists like ACOG also have this same recommendation.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  All right, so actually we're the only country in the world that gives it to six-month-olds and up. They're trying to give it to newborns now. They're giving it to newborns inside their mothers. This is all demonstrable lies.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  They've had to fire three FDA boards as they wouldn't approve this. It's going to come back to haunt that guy. He needs to face Nuremberg.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  There's a war against our masculinity. There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  But through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer now. We've never put anything out as powerful. It's InfoWars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:09.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  When you share the links or articles from InfoWars.com you are engaged in a revolutionary act against tyranny, a life-saving act and I ask you to intensify your efforts and I salute you.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  Alright, let's get to it right now. I just showed the president of the UPMC in Pittsburgh Hospital and it's the same kind of hospitals that do all the gendered stuff on little boys to girls and girls to boys.
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  They're not turning to a girl or a boy, they're being sterilized. These are the folks that tell you that two men can have a baby.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  It's all upside down world. You know, they use DNA to prove somebody committed a murder 30 years ago and that's all scientific, but now the science guy, Bill Nye's new shows tell kids that there are no X and Y chromosomes.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  I played the clip. I'm not making that up. They're murdering the truth. They're murdering science and he sits up there and says, out of tens of thousands of women, nobody's had a miscarriage, nobody's had a sick baby.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  That's a damn lie. I just showed you the New England Medical Journal and others. It's a staggering death rate in these little babies and the ones that live or born in many cases covered in sores, their immune system eating their blood vessels.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  And I've already shown you a lot of statistics, but overhead shot, please. Here's some of the numbers. Cases, series, drug analyst print, and then it basically breaks down going through different hospitals, the number of miscarriages they're having.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  And we're talking hundreds and hundreds, ladies and gentlemen, per hospital. Here's another one. Case, series, drug analysis, COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer, BioNTech. And just in their limited study they did once it was launched, 505.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  Unbelievable. And we've already shown you the national international statistics. This is the reality.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  Here is James Thrope, MD at Senator Ron Johnson's hearings last week. Miscarriages increased by a factor of 58 since the safe and effective.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  Massive increase. What did Alexander Sultz and Eaton say about this? He goes, we know they are lying. They know they are lying. They know we know they are lying. We know they know we know they are lying, but they are still lying.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  So here's a clip of James Thrope, medical doctor at Senator Ron Johnson's hearing on miscarriages increasing massively.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  My patients are women of reproductive age, pregnant women, and pre-born babies. And what I've seen in my clinical practice has been a substantial, massive increase unprecedented in menstrual abnormalities prior to pregnancy. A substantial increase in infertility.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  A substantial increase in miscarriage, fetal death, and fetal malformation. We published many studies this year over the last two years. Our latest study, which we've used from VAERS and CDC data, and we compared the COVID-19 vaccines over the last 15, 18 months with those of the influenza vaccine pregnancy.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  And what we see is catastrophic. It's a danger signal like no others. I don't have time to review all of those problems, but what I will say is that the CDC and the FDA look for a two-fold increase as a danger signal, a two-fold increase.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  What our study showed was not two-fold increases, but 1,500 or 1,000 increases in menstrual abnormalities, for example, almost 1,200-fold increase compared to the influenza vaccine.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  About miscarriage, 58-fold increase in miscarriage from the COVID-19 vaccines compared to that of the influenza vaccine. And I could go on and on. Fetal death, 38-fold increase. This is what I've seen. This is what the data shows.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  My patients are the rate-limiting factor of future generations of the human race. I want to ask why the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology?
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  Why the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology? And why the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine? All of whom I've served in a professional capacity in an outstanding fashion my entire career. Why they are pushing this lethal vaccine in risky?
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  Because they are a depopulationist cult. Notice that in that Senate hearing with Dr. Thorpe, he gives you documents and files where you can see the facts.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  Didn't hear that from the UPMC hospital president in his little white lab coat? He just said it never hurt anybody ever. There aren't even miscarriages anymore. He said that. They don't even exist.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  This stuff's so safe it cured miscarriages. It doesn't even happen anymore. He said that. Boy, total lie.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  1,000 plus percent increases. But he tells you nothing's happening. Go back to sleep. Do you remember in 2001 when the poison shot started? It started four months before in the U.K. and we had the numbers of women, 85-year-old women suddenly menstruating who had menstruated in 30, 40 years, young women period stopping or just turning on all the time.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  There are women now in the news that have been bleeding for a year and a half. They have to take iron supplements and stuff because they're just talking about doing hysterectomies because they're just bleeding all the time.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  They're doing hysterectomies. They're cutting young women's uteruses out everywhere because they just bleed all the time. It's so liberal. No, it's depopulation cult. They did it. They launched the attack.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  It hits your body in so many ways. It's a super weapon. And the average doctor that went along with this or nurse doesn't want to admit what they're a part of, but it's coming out and they're not going to be able to stop us.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  But they already hit us and hit us really hard. That's why they were so desperate. It'll give you a free hamburger. Hey, you can still fly again.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  Hey, we'll let you out of your house. Just please take the shot. It's totally safe. We love you. Yes, we want to depopulate you. Yes, we run foundations that say we want to kill you.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  Yes, we want death panels. Yes, we're pushing government force euthanasia. Yes, yes, we put up monuments saying we want to cull 7 million people. Yes, that's true.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  Yes, we promote pedophilia. Yes, we push fentanyl. Yes, we want to cut off all the main energy pipelines and power plants. Yes, we say there's too many of you, but please take this shot. We love you so much.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  And in the hospitals that are paid whores, the presidents of these get up there and tell you there's zero bad effect because they're told to get up there and lie because they are desperate.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  And this is polluting the human genome. All right, I'm done on the shots, but it's front and center because we are winning. We are at least they have almost like 2% uptake or something of the new poison shots.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  People now get it and they just voted to cut defense spending in the force vaccines continues. So that's stopping in the military.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  At least it's supposed to. But, you know, the law gets ignored around here. So who knows. But this is a big, big deal. And the credit goes to our audience and our guests and our sponsors and our affiliates in this crew that we have saved tens of millions of lives and hundreds of millions.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  And into the future, we are educating the public about what they're facing, no matter how horrible the truth is. And there couldn't be more important work being done. So thank you all for what you've done.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  All right, news blitz coming up and then I'm going to open the phones up for an hour and 15 minutes or so or we'll go two, three hours.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  We'll just we'll just go and go and go and take your phone calls on this live Friday edition. It's all coming up. But please share the live links, save lives, infoworks.com for a show and tell them to share it and tell them to tell them to share it and so on and so forth.

[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:06.000]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.

[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:10.000]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air broadcasting free worldwide and it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:18.000]  Things are getting very weird and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:33.000]  But we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the air and you can do that now at infoworksstore.com. Help us clear out our stock of bodies tumor, vitamin C with zinc and alpha power.

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  So many people in this industry. You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones including myself.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcast with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cast, the super Tim Cast IRL. Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:33:06.000]  We need to support free speech systems right now. So go check out the store. Go support their store. Go support InfoWars. Leave a donation right now. Don't wait until they're gone.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  Look, I'm sorry that we have to cover such hard-core news and I wish it wasn't true, but it's all out in the oven now. You know it is. We've got a job to do.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  I want to give the toll-free number out and I want to take first-time calls today. We've had free-for-alls the last three, four days with phone calls, long-time callers, first-time you name it.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  But today is first-time callers on any issue, any subject I've covered, any subject you want to cover, any questions you've got, anything. You disagree with me? You agree?
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  It is an absolute wide open situation as long as you're a first-time caller and as long as you've got a clean phone line because I want to just get to you and move the next person so we get more of these amazing callers and all your interesting perspectives.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  Sometimes wacky, almost always amazing, sometimes over-the-top incredible. Your calls are really appreciated and I wanted to take a ton of them here today interspersed with all this other news that I haven't even scratched the surface on yet.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  But nowhere do we have them dead to rights like these poison shots that they're killing us by design, doing it to take full control, depopulating us, bringing in a tracking system to launch even more deadly attacks in the future.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  So we're fighting their main assault together. We've got to pray for discernment and pray for God's providence.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, and we'll start taking your calls coming up in the next segment.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  And I'm going to intersperse a lot here too. The new JFK files coming out, the next-level PETO promotion, what's happening with the Federal Reserve, Elon Musk,
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  banning people that keep harassing and doxing folks, saying where people are, saying come and attack them.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  That's what CNN does. That's what The Washington Post does. They've done it to me.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  And I've never really talked about it here on air because it encourages them and it lets them know it's having an effect, but at some point I'll be able to tell you all about it.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  But it is extreme. And it's not just platforming. They find out who you got software with or who you're using for banking or any of it,
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  and they literally start calling low-level, high-level presidents of companies. They start harassing people. Then the numbers get given to these Democrat Party organizations that have millions of volunteers,
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  and then they just do whatever the hell they want. They come to your house, everything. And so it's bad.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  And the average person just has no idea how bad it is. They're not just surveilling everybody. They're not just censoring folks.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  They're harassing the living daylights out of people. They're threatening to cut people's heads off.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  People always wonder why you never see Dr. Edward Group on this show anymore.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  And he asked me not to get into a lot of it. Some of it came out separately through other sources, so I can talk about what's already been made public by others,
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  but I'm going to leave it at that. Good friend of mine, super smart, great guy.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  They infiltrated his company. They stalked him. They made calls to his wife, knowing where she was at and where she was, letting her know she was being followed,
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  and threatening to cut his family's heads off. Thinking that would shut us down.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  He was just a guest on our show and helped get me into the supplement business. But that's the type of crap that goes on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  Everyone on the show again? Because if somebody threatens to cut your wife and your kids' heads off to your wife, that's a little bit of an effect.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  And then lets you know, by the way, we're watching you right now handle the papayas at the grocery store.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  Well, that's what they do. They're there. They're letting you know. The average person can't deal with that. I can deal with it.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  And my wife can deal with it. If they put pressure on my family, only one person in the last 28 years of my family's cracked.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  And you know all about that. You see it everywhere. And they went over to the other side and went under full stock of them syndrome.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  And they paid off some former employees to tell outrageous lies. But that's on them and I forgive them in the name of Jesus.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  So sad. Outrageous. Bizarre. Just ridiculous lies. But they tell ridiculous lies because it needs to sound ridiculous.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  And when I saw that X-File clip last night from 2016 with Chris Carter where the main character, warning everybody as a talk show host based on all the shows he said,
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  and the show had 30, 40 million viewers a day at that time, we changed the whole world. We were taking the government back.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  There were X-File shows about a vaccine that erases your immune system with spike proteins.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  And that was good people in our government, warning everybody ahead of time. And Lord knows Trump was warned.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  And I was watching that last night again today when we heard it. Just let me know really how effective we've been.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  Not in a power trip, short of way, but why the enemy hates us so much. We almost beat them years ago.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  This audience, us together. And now they know we're still there, still fighting and gaining ground all the time.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  So understand this is a real war, ladies and gentlemen. An absolute real war.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  And they use COINTELPRO, they use all other sorts of tactics. And what COINTELPRO is, they call your wife up and they say,
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  Oh, hi, my name is Jenny, is Alex there? Well, we'll know he's at work. Well, no, we're supposed to meet now. He's not here.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  This is the number I had. Well, who are you? Oh, I'm his fiance. Well, that's not true. I'm married to him.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  Oh, well, that's impossible. I'm pregnant with his baby. That's what they did to Martin Luther King's wife.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  This is what they do, folks. And so with me, it doesn't intimidate me. I know these people want control of our children.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  Look, look what they do. They're a bunch of pedophiles on average. I have a job to fight these people. I'm a damn coward.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  I'm a piece of filth if I don't fight these people. And again, it isn't some heroic thing to fight them. This is what I'm supposed to do as a man.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  My grandfathers and their fathers and their fathers would have done what I'm doing. And I have not run up the white flag far beyond it.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  We have devastated them because God has given us providence and we will beat them.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  I don't say this because of vengeance. I don't want any violence against these scumbags. I want to take back the government, take back the Justice Department,
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  take back the grand juries at the state level, like you see the standards doing, and I want to see them tried.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  And just like Nuremberg, too, after they're tried, they're put in jail until they get their appeal, and when that appeal fails,
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  we hang their ass on live television to let the other psychos and other snow for generations, we don't put up with this.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  But yes, I want Fauci convicted for crimes against humanity, making race-specific weapons, making gain-of-function weapons that threaten all of our lives
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  and are illegal, and it's in the chemical and biological weapons U.S. federal law. If you make those weapons with an intent to distribute them,
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  it is the death penalty. Of course it is. If there's anything you deserve to hang high for, it's this.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  And if anybody in the government or anybody in these other systems thinks you're going to pretend to go along with this and you're going to protect your family,
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  or are suicidal, we're not the threat to you. Alex Jones is not the threat to all the bureaucrats and all the corporate-tocracy people.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  You are the threat. You're evil is the threat. You are the problem.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  All right, I got to get those to go to your calls. I'm going to come back in a few minutes, and I'm going to go through it all.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  There's so much to hit here, and I didn't mean to go off on that rant. It's just that I have watched them attack people.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  I've watched their persecution. To the point, I just get numb to it. And I got to remind myself, no Jones, don't get numb
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  and so comfortable with the attacks and the evil. So unfearing, because I just have the mission to carry out, that I don't even watch my back.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  I don't even... It's not good. I have to remember to be concerned. I have to remember to look over my shoulder.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  I have to remember to care to keep this body in action on this planet in the fight, and not go so far to the other side that I just don't even give a damn.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  So it's a needle. We've got to thread all of us. But to all of our great veterans, don't you let those psychiatrists get you to commit suicide?
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  Don't you let them get you on all those drugs that make you commit suicide? Go to God. Love God. Help others.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  Be sacrificed your time and energy to help those that are in more need than you, and that will lift you up.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  That will empower you. That will take you to the next level. I know it.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  But we're all veterans of a bio-weapon attack. We're all veterans of a New World Order culture war.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  I don't care what color you are, where you came from. We should come together against the transhumanist New World Order.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  And we should tell them we will never surrender. Never!
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  And just ask God for the strength. Say, God, I can't do it, but I want to be good, and I want to stand up for the innocent.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  Help me. Give me the discernment and energize me, God. Help me if you want me to be a tool in the fight. Fill my vessel.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  And God will answer. And then the real war begins.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  The highest quality, triple tested. Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  You'll get them at infowarstore.com under our exclusive label.

[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms,
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.

[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with a globalist. I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason you've had the success.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  But I couldn't have done it without your support, and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been because of your past support.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle, free double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  1776 is the promo code. The destination is infowarstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  I'm working in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime, reflecting on my past life, and it doesn't have much time.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  I use it five o'clock.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  Time.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  Running low for Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates. Running low, running low, running low, running low.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  You are not going to shut off humanity. You will be destroyed in the world order.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  Running low.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  Alright, I want to go to your phone calls, so I see you have great questions.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  Like, we have one of these callers, Mark in Tennessee says, where do the border crossers go?
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  Boy, that's a whole big subject there. I mean, that's just so massive, and in fact, that's what I'm going to talk about the first of the show.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  So I'm going to go to him first here in a moment and address that because that is another big key to all of this.
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  You just know how wantingly, diabolically evil and destructive these people are. So we're going to answer that question.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  $14,000 a day at El Paso alone. That's the El Paso mayor. A third of them are little children.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  Just being handed over to whoever.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  Project Veritas confirming right here in Austin is sex slaves as young as six. Just where's the Texas Rangers? Well, they're all overwhelmed.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  And then Soros controls almost all the prosecutors, so they won't prosecute.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  Checkmate. Date to complete.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  I'm going to go to your calls, but we cut a couple of really good ads announcing this new line of products that I can tell you is the most powerful ever.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  They're not putting down the old products.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  Kind of like Gillette would say the best a man could get, but it had two razors.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  Then the three one came in. I think that's really the best. They kind of had four or six. Got a little ridiculous.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  But as we go through the years with the supplements and what's developed and what's known to be the best out there, things do get better actually.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  The science of that is openly exploding as it works so well.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  So here is a little quick promo on the new three products from the Info Wars Platinum line at infowarstore.com and then write to your phone calls.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  I want you to remember two words. Info Wars Platinum.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  In the history of Info Wars supplements and they're amazing.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  This is hands down the most powerful game changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  Now all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a pharmaceutical company that also makes high end supplements.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  And the owner's a listener and a supporter. So they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  Over 20% off what they're sold online under the Info Wars Platinum brand name.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  These are incredible. Pain MD, HGH Max Boost and of course 1776 testosterone boost.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  Read about them at infowarstore.com, learn about them and then try it out for yourself.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  And I know you will be a repeat customer which is awesome. It will empower your life, make your life more amazing and it will keep us on the air a 360 win.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  Info Wars Platinum now available at infowarstore.com.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  There's a war against our masculinity. There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great but we've got a real game changer now.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  We've never put anything out that's powerful. It's Info Wars Platinum now exclusively available at 40% off at infowarstore.com.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of Info Wars Platinum at infowarstore.com.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD and it's 1776 testosterone boost.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  Yield it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund the Info War.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  Very excited Info Wars Platinum at infowarstore.com. Okay.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  I want to go to your calls and I want to answer the question before I go to it so you can then elaborate.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  Where do they go and the answer is God only knows but we have a pretty good idea. We know where a lot of them go.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  Again, to talk about this, that's why I'm constantly frustrated because it would take an hour to explain this properly.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  I mean, this is a big question and we know what happens in Europe. We know what happens here. It's the guy that ran the whole implosion of Europe the last 10 years for the UN
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  and works for Soros, runs the whole Texas sector. The board patrol takes orders from NGOs the last two years since Biden stole the election
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  and they have built giant processing centers that can process it with 20,000 people a day and they built up, what is it, eight, nine of them that I know of?
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  El Paso is getting 14,500 they were saying, a day flooding in, title 42 is about to go away in just a few weeks where there's just no controls
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  and Biden said, when I get elected, I want you to immediately surge the border, you'll be legalized.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  So he said it, he did it and it's all UN run, the UN, just like they control the borders in Europe, they're in control of our borders.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  They control the executive branch and so you ask where they go, they go into sex slavery, but that's the minority of them.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  That's still a big part of it, but I'd say not even 10%, maybe 5%, that's a guesstimation, dead reckoning.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  They get signed up for welfare, they get to Democrat and red states where Democrats are setting up voting enclaves, they sign them up for welfare
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  and then they sign them up for a job, many times being paid under the table pennies on the dollar and then the Democrats skim part of their paycheck
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  and they skim through these immigration lawyers, part of their welfare check and then they also set them up for other crimes like tax refunds and things
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  where they've had cases in Austin, Texas where one address got 600 and something million sent to it, just one little house
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  and then the FBI doesn't prosecute, they don't investigate, it's just total lawless crime, they use them as cutouts for the money laundering,
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  for the drug dealing, for the sex slavery, just for everything else you can imagine.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  And then the Mexican drug cartels then put their money in US banks controlled by Democrats as well, that's why Pelosi calls MS-13 God's children
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  and so that's what they do and then we have footage in South Texas on the border where they're just loading five-year-old girls up with just random men
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  who don't even know them and they just drive off with them and they come over and say, what's your problem?
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  I'm about to take this girl to Pennsylvania and teach her the Lord, he said teach the mental board operates and we said, what are you going to do?
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  Well, we're going to make these people work in a restaurant and be on welfare, they don't even hide it.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  They're just taking babies in the airport, no paperwork, just handing them over to people, they just disappear with them NGOs.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  I mean, this is a giant Democrat party run human smuggling.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  So, Jeff, first time caller, we're going to get to you coming up and Mark and Tennessee's first up, you say, where do they all go?
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  What's your view on this?
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  Go ahead and you're on the air, Mark and Tennessee.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  Can you hear me?
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  I can, I'm sorry, they didn't punch you up, go ahead.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  Okay, I can't believe that we can't see crowds of them here, there and everywhere.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  But, you know, they almost remain invisible.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:12.000]  Here in Knoxville, I know a month ago, three buses went north, south, east and west.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  Where did they go?
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  And don't you think it's time for, it's time for guillotine song?
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  What happens is they'll stick them in houses, five persons to a room, like I told you, they then get them jobs working for Democrat party crime organizations,
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  sex trade, drug dealing, but a lot of us just working in textiles, working in restaurants, working in hotels.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  And then again, the local mafia, one of the Democrats and the lawyers, then skims their paycheck and their welfare.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  And so they're just used, basically, as human cutouts to suck money off the taxpayer and then they themselves are highly exploited.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  So that's what goes on, they get exploited on the way here.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  84% of women and children, according to Amos International Report five years ago, are raped on their way here.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  So they're raped on their way here, they pay money to get here.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  If their families that are here don't pay money, they're then put an 18-wheeler to die or they're hung.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  And their dead bodies are just everywhere, all over South Texas, all over the Mexican border, just piles of dead bodies everywhere, piles of trash.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  You gotta go, they're just dead bodies, it's just insane.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  People's heads cut off, newspapers blown up, just total death, it's all liberal, it's all trendy.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  And so people inside the U.S. don't know yet, go to the South Texas border, you'll see what it's like.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  I mean, you cannot describe it, 14,500 a day just hitting El Paso.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:58:13.000]  We'll be right back.

[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner is a listener, and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram, or the 20 milligram. You're not going to find two-market 95% of cumanoid at the price we're selling it.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  These similar formulas, or the same formulas, sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:59.000]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com, a true 360 win.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  This is the fall of our republic. 60 million aborted babies.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  Poison shots, open borders, giant human smuggling, had a fall drag queen time.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:27.000]  The wages of sin is death. It's here.
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  But there's California, Arizona, Texas, you name it, every day, tens of thousands in every sector just pour across.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  It's all to come by Biden to be exploited, to be controlled, and to be put in the voting booths to keep those that have enslaved them in power.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  Scott in Illinois, you're on the year, then we're going to go to everybody else. Go ahead, Scott.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  Hello, Brother Alex. We love you here in Chicago.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  Been listening to you from way back 20 years ago. Wanted to say you have, thanks so much for all the information.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  You're right, Alex. Everybody knows you got railroaded. That wasn't a real trial. We all realize that that wasn't a trial.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  It was just a show, a production. Back onto the supplements before I forget.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.000]  You have some of the most excellent supplements. I've been taking supplements for 40 years. I'm 65 years old.
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  I was involved in an automobile accident five years ago. If not for your X2 and body ease and knockout products, I'm telling you they work.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  If they didn't work, I wouldn't buy them. So people that say that you sell snake oil, BS. Alex has really good products.
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  Look, all this stuff is sold in Whole Foods under other names. It's the high end stuff at Whole Foods. They all know it's real.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  They just say it's a lie. Of course, we sell stuff that works because you're going to come back and get it.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  Amen. Amen. Alex Jones, I want to get you some money. Alex, would you be the trustee for me of my inheritance?
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  I have a way for you to become a very wealthy man, Alex. You're going to be able to take 5% of every transaction that I do.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  I'd like to buy millions of dollars of real estate. In every transaction, Mr. Jones, you're allowed legally and lawfully to take 5% of it.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  Well, I know a lot of the left gets everybody to give them their money and we don't have any big backers like that.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000]  Well, we've had one big person donate twice in the Bitcoin that kept us on air.
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  But I don't have much infrastructure to be able to handle stuff like that. I don't know anything about real estate or how to be a trustee.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  No, you don't have to know anything. Alex, if I want to come down to Texas and buy myself a brand new $100,000 Ford pickup truck,
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  I need you to be there in the dealership to sign the check to make the payment to the Ford dealership to buy the truck for cash.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  Well, we should set up a lawyer or something here.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  No, we want to stay away from the bar. The bar is our enemy. Alex, will you allow me to come back on when I gain total control over my strawman account
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  so I can teach everybody how to do this?
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  Absolutely. Send me an email. Showtipsandmfullwords.com.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  You got it, bro. That's what I'm calling about. Next one. I love you. Thank you for letting me talk to you.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000]  Merry Christmas, Alex.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  Merry Christmas, brother. I appreciate it.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  I love you. We're all behind you, brother. Don't you stop.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:25.000]  I'm not. I'm not, Scott. Thanks for the support.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  Yeah, I mean, the biggest, easiest thing people to do is get products they already need.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  And again, body's ultimate turmeric formula is sold out, but I learned, hey, we're getting that 95% of humanoid from this company.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  So we'll still have the bodies for folks that want to order the bodies.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  It's just now we're going to have it made by this company and they're making it as people want the old brand.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  It's the same thing, but now we have it under turmeric 95 because it's 95% of humanoid.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  That's one of the great ingredients in it. So turmeric 95 is the new M4s MD brand. Thank you.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  But look, callers are great, but we don't, if you've had great experiences, that's great.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  But you don't have to thank me or plug the products.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  I really want to hear what you think about politics in the world.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000]  Now, I went to a guy named Mark earlier on accident with the other caller.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  He hung up and called back. Mark will get to you.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  But Chance and LJ and Jeff and QC and Jeremy and Andrew and Emily and Sean and Kevin,
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  we're going to come right back and just get to your calls.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  And I'm not bitching, but no need to thank me because it's like Russia's to say, just say kudos.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  Because I understand you want to thank me. I want to thank you too.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  But I really want to hear what you have to say and a lot of other folks want to hear it as well.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  Never watch like politicians or statesmen that aren't very seasoned.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  When they get up to have a campaign speech, they'll spend half the speech just thanking their crew.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  But then there's never any content. Let's just get right to the content.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  And I love you too. When we come back.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  All right, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer now.
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000]  We've never put anything out this powerful. It's info wars platinum.

[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000]  Yeah.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  50,000.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  We are back. Our number three chance is a first time caller from Florida chance.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:51.000]  You're on the air. Welcome.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  Yeah, let's punch those. Yeah, sorry.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  It's just Jimmy. Just give me a second. Yeah, we just didn't punch you up.
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000]  We're going to do it now though. Okay. Chance. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  Hey Alex.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  I'm here again. Yes. That's the problem when we don't punch a caller up right away.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  They don't know they're there and they do this thing. Yes, sir. I love you. I love you. Please. You're on the air.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  Okay. Well, I won't call him about today.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:30.000]  What God laid on my heart was repealing the no hide laws. Are you familiar with it?
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  Yes, I've heard all about this from the seventh day and then it's for a long time.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:39.000]  Bring back laws banning Saturday worship and start cutting people's heads off with guillotines and they don't follow it.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  Well, I'm just talking about the bill Dan, the buyer who was a representative of time wrote an article about it.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  Yeah, so tell me, tell me your view on no hide laws. Go ahead.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  Well, that's just one thing I want to start. I just want to, I think we should get that repealed because you see every way they're using any kind of little legal thing they can to the max.
[02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:07.000]  I think it's something we should definitely get up and get this repealed and it's one of those things that's very eye opening for like the public and everything.
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:14.000]  No, you're right. There's a lot of weird stuff on the books. You know, there's like laws in some states that donkeys can't sleep in bathtubs.
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  I'm not kidding. That's real. A lot of crazy stuff, brother.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  I said, Bill Dan and my review type in him and the US government can legally kill Christians and he was an active representative at the time. He wrote this article only going past four representatives and four members of the house.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  I hear you brother. I appreciate your call. We're moving fast. LJ first time caller in Pennsylvania. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  Alex, I have a few interesting points on Dr. Malone that I want to get your viewpoint on. I saw a thrive time show on band.video with Dr. Judy Mike of it stating that Malone is a part of NIH active, which brings together the CDC FDA,
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  DOD, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Karma and more to accelerate COVID vaccine. Something else that is interesting is a man named Dr. Bregans. He was the central scientific expert who went to battle to stop the government from torturing patients with lobotomies and electroshock treatment.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  I know who Dr. Bregans is. He's been on the show a couple of times, wrote a book and I'm familiar with this controversy and I like Dr. Macavits and I like Dr. Malone.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  Of course Malone has been in all the major groups. He's a total insider and it's kind of like Dr. Huff, who was the vice president of EcoHealth Alliance, their chief scientist, going public exposing how they made the weapon and how they released it and he agrees with me.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  Here's the deal. You're welcome to call in about this and I want you to elaborate. But hold on just a second. Bregan and then Malone, Bregans made an issue where he's talking about mass psychosis so the public took the shot and then Bregans saying no, they did it through intimidation.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  So they're kind of scientifically fighting over mass psychosis and all the rest of it. I don't think Malone's bad. Malone has come out and exposed the new world order. Malone has come out and said these shots are dangerous and we shouldn't take them for two plus years.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  And so, I mean, we've got to be ready is what I'm saying, to have insiders who come over to our side. We've got to be ready to win. We can't think just because somebody has been on the inside and the inventor of mRNA that then when they warn it's being misused that then we think, well, they must be a bad guy because they've been an insider.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  Is that makes sense? Yeah, I was just wondering if he was truly a whistleblower. And I do have one thing to bring up about the vaccines. Recently, Swedish researchers at one university found that the vaccine is able to enter human liver cells, where the mRNA has been reversed transcribed intracellularly into DNA in as fast as six hours.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:21.000]  100%. And that's why it causes so much liver failure and kidney failure. You are 100% right. We talked about that a lot of scientists, we should talk about it more that within hours it begins to go to the liver and then get into your cells DNA, which is crazy that they had an ex files episode about that in 2016.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  Why do you think they're doing that, LJ? You know, another another interesting point on the vaccine that I want to hear what you think is that it's containing graphene and interacting with 5G and Wi-Fi and those snake like structures.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  There's a bunch of studies showing that it's growing a graphene oxide matrix inside the body, not just what's in the shot, but because you already have those compounds in your body, it's growing it in the body.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  And you've all know herari says the plan is to give us shots that grow a new structure in our body. Yes, we are getting pigs. You're 100% dead on. Thank you, LJ.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  Listen, I'm not criticizing LJ for calling in and bringing up Dr. Malone. I don't know if Dr. Malone's perfect. I don't know if Dr. Malone is covering his ass because he knows this is all coming out.
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  But he's not like doing it now. He's been before they gave the shots saying, don't do it. It's going to cause problems. I didn't invent this for this.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:30.000]  And we did my study showing it would cause problems. So I mean, I don't see the fault in him. They took him off Twitter, they censored him, they attacked him.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  These scientists, though, they all fight with each other. And that's just not what I do. People are welcome to do it. They can do it all day if they want. It's like Elon Musk.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:46.000]  I don't trust him as far as I'm throwing, but he's doing a bunch of good stuff. When he does something good, I'm going to point it out. Let's talk to QC, first time caller in Virginia. Thank you for calling.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  Yes, sir. I have something very important I need to let you know. And this is in regard to stopping the new order, sir, predictive programming they're using.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  The problem is we give them authority and control by letting them set the rules. And by them setting the rules, they're taking away our free will.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  And the way we get our free will back is by using what I call, again, through predictive analytics, using quantum communication.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  Now, the way we look at this figure this out, sir, I've done a couple of things to help you already. The Bitcoin donation that you received that kept you on the air, I did that.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  The removal of Fauci from his high platform, I did that. I'm doing something else for you that you asked for. I'm going to do it to show you the power of quantum communication.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  I figured this out over 15 years of study. I figured this out. I am going to convict Fauci. I'm doing what you asked to do. You want Fauci convicted, it's done. Something about it's going to happen.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  I'm also going to do this. Colbert, Stephen Colbert, he's removed. Something about his power and authority is removed. He's evil. They're tyrants. And they set the rules.
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  And the way to get the rules back is by getting our free will back and by getting our creativity back. And I know how to do it. When these things happen, I will call you back.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  I've done amazing things.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  Well, God bless you, brother. I don't know if this is like an Oprah Winfrey's secret or whatever, but I know we pray to God things can definitely happen. We can move mountains together.
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  But I'll tell you this. What you said about how they set the parameters of debate as if you've got one thing on one side and one on the other.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  Then you only debate what's within that narrow field. That's how they manipulate free will is making you think you only have these choices. Is that what you're getting at?
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:30.000]  Yes, exactly. If you have a stoplight with a green light and a red light and you got two people who are making decisions and the rules are set by them.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  The green and red light rules are set by them. The AI technology that we get to stop, the stoplight. That's AI technology they've introduced into the field.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  So two people are making, they want to go through that light. They're both thinking green, green. So they go through there and obviously their chaos.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.000]  Well, they set the rules and those rules say this is going to be red and this is going to be green. You're going to go when I say.
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  But that's removing our free will to decide for ourselves. Evil lives in their control.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:07.000]  Have you seen the footage like in India? I meant to play this in Indian places where there's no stoplights and it's it's like millions of cars just zooming way faster.
[02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:15.000]  And it shows it's better than any red light system and less wrecks and everybody just knows how to me and then like the humans just know when to go.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  It's some crazy footage guys show massive traffic. No stoplights India and it's other places too. And it's just it's just yeah. This isn't that man.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  I've seen some in India where it's like thousands of cars at once and they don't need but yeah roundabouts are a good example of that.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  Yeah. Human technology is the most advanced technology were made by God. You're absolutely right. These are okay.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  But man the ones I sent you guys months ago that I forgot to play are just incredible. It shows like a high up building and just these huge roads and it's just thousands of cars at once just zooming around.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  It's amazing. That's human AI. Thank you QC. All right Jeremy and other Emily your calls are coming up.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow info warriors here in the United States and around the world.

[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  So when I first started taking survival shield basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that.
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:28.000]  You know with a deeper source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  You know I could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:53.000]  The point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  Beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the wellness company.

[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:10.000]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air broadcasting free worldwide and it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:21.000]  Things are getting very weird and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on but we'll keep doing our best so long as you keep us on the air.
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  And you can do that now at info war store dot com help us clear out our stock of bodies tumor vitamin C with zinc and alpha power.

[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:18.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:28.000]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide. A lot of news coming up before in this hour and eight hours. Thanks over right back to your phone calls right now. Jeremy first time caller from Canada.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.000]  Thanks for calling.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  Just punch him up. Yeah, go ahead Jeremy you're on the air.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000]  Okay, I just wanted to say thank you.
[02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  I know you don't want to hear that.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:50.000]  Canada loves Alex Jones is in fours dot com. So I wanted to say that have you ever heard of rock them road?
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.000]  It's on the border of New York State and Quebec.
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000]  No, I haven't.
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:05.000]  So there has been a massive amount of illegal immigrants coming into there, you know, in this guys of refugee.
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  So that I've always been worried about that because your border is wide open and I'm like well they're just going to come on into Canada too because that's our prime manipulator of Canada.
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  He's like come on everybody.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  So just something to take note of.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  Absolutely. I'm not even against these poor people but the globalists shut out their economies of the lockdowns then they organize and bring them here and then they sign them up for welfare, give them low paying jobs and drive down all of our wages.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  It's absolutely disgusting. Anything else Jeremy?
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  Well, I have a message for the liberal Democrats.
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:58.000]  I want to tell them the progressive regressive brat community because they're just a bunch of brat and what I wanted to tell you all because I know you all listen and I just want you to know that we're not going anywhere.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  And like Alex says, it's time for humanity to stand up and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this but if you want to fight, you got one.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  And the globalists are a bunch of inbred scum like King Charles and their minions are a bunch of self-appointed trash and only our submission to them lets them be in control.
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:28.000]  We just need to stop complying with BS and expose them and build our own systems. Amazing call. Thank you Jeremy.
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.000]  Andrew, first time caller from the great state of Texas. Go ahead.
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  Hey Alex, thank you. Thank you. I wanted to give an update. I don't know if, well, we were mandated toward the vaccine back in when it came through. I didn't get it.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:57.000]  I got a religious exemption but my buddy in San Antonio and wife got it. Didn't really talk much since then. He called me last night and said, hey, pray for us, man, we can't get well.
[02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  I didn't want to tell him, hey bro, your immune system is gone. I'm not going to give him the bad news. But let me ask you, if I own nasal 20% spray, would that get that graphene oxide out and get that spike protein out?
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  There are a bunch of studies on nasal sprays that are going to fly on an airplane or think you're starting to get sick because the virus first grows in the nasal passage that have been known to knock it out.
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  We're not selling them. We don't have them. People can look them up. There are some studies that say that. The biggest thing is your vitamin D, your vitamin C, all the zinc in your body makes your cells where it's very hard for the viruses to get in and replicate.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:45.000]  And also, a lot of people that have already gotten sick, medical doctors have told me, take cycles of ivermectin which then gets rid of it.
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  So if you've already had COVID, you need to take cycles of ivermectin to what I've been told. I'm not saying do that, but I've had my family do it.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:24:00.000]  Rob do was like, devastated, almost died. He took cycle after cycle. He's almost back to where he was. Same thing with my dad, same thing with my mother and others.
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  And so whatever ivermectin does is it stops the virus from replicating. And once you've got it from the shot or the virus, the shots obviously far worse studies show, the ivermectin and other things stop it replicating.
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  But the problem is you're not 99% of it out in your body that 1% starts regenerating again. So it grows in your body like a plant grows in soil, like a weed.
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  And so that's a great point to raise. So you have some folks close to you that took it and that's a show we should do.
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  We haven't done one of those in a while. We can take four hours of calls. In fact, I've done commercial free shows on the weekend.
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  We take like a hundred calls and every caller calls in and says, my dad died of a heart attack. My son died. I got super sick.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  Well, I mean, it's just and we have the numbers to it. But anecdotally, it is just incredible what the good news is, it sounds like your friends now now know it was the shots that did it to him.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  Have they figured that out?
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  Yes. Right. Right. Yes. He's a man. He's sick. He's sick all the time. But I'm grateful because I've been to cycling him, but I'm grateful that he didn't have a heart issue and I and I don't think he has.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  If he hasn't told me, but he hasn't mentioned anything about his heart.
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  Well, I know that I'm not going to give medical advice to people, but he also kills it.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  So if you can get a spa membership and get in a steam room or a regular spa, and it's not fun to do, but really heat yourself up and jump in cold water, heat yourself up, jump in cold water.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  Doctors are saying that's working. He could get it online. There's online pharmacies.
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  He should take, I'm not telling him what to do, but I would take ivermectin cycle to try to kill those prions that are growing and then just really ramp up the supplements.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  Really ramp up the vitamin D, the CoQ10, the PQQ, the B12, the vitamin C, the zinc. That's what it's going to take.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  Hey, real quick. Thanks for that. Hey, Alex, on your HGH, what supplement is in the HGH? Is it the IGF growth factor one? I'm just curious.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  You're going to have to go read about it for yourself because I've got the whole ingredients list here.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  But it's the top seller in the country we private labeled and we're not going to sit here and make claims about it or any of that.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  It's just really, really, really, really, really strong and it makes you really, really sleepy when you take it because it makes you, whatever it does, it's something you take when you go to bed because it makes your body reboot.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  Right. Hey, thank you. And I got one more thing. I got a son who's going to be coming, turning up professional in Austin, Texas, boxing.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:42.000]  He's been boxing since Tuesday. We're going to go ahead and as soon as we get on TV, we're going to plug in for wars.com and Alex Jones was right.
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:50.000]  Brother, God bless you. That's how you override the sensors. I love you, Andrew. Thank you. Emily, first time caller in Colorado. Go ahead.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  Hi there. Can you hear me?
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000]  Yes, I can. Go ahead. Thank you.
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  Oh, wonderful. Hi. It's great to talk to you. I've been trying to call in since late 2020.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  I got COVID really badly. I actually wrote out my last flow in Testament and I was very, very sick.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  My girlfriend and I both got sick at the same time and we were studying up on this.
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  I drew the correlation with parasites and we tried anything to kind of overcome because we both got like long COVID effects.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  And we tried Rife. Actually, Royal Raymond Rife Jr. He is the one who created the Rife, which is this frequencies that you listen to.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  And there's a machine that you can get. It's pretty expensive.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:48.000]  And by the way, I think a lot of con artists have jumped on the Rife thing and done stuff that isn't real, but the Rife research is real.
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  And now we know that 5G and all this is creating all sorts of frequencies they can modulate to literally lower oxygen in the blood, stop viruses growing, make viruses grow.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  So this is definitely real science. They've proven it.
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:15.000]  Yes. Well, we tried it. And honestly, it was just listening to YouTube frequencies, isochronic tones, 21, 28 hertz, and the effects were incredible.
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  Well, look at how just a beautiful song like Beethoven touches you. And that's just a sound, but your brain interprets it and it ups your mood, ups your brainwaves.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  Exactly. There's total evidence on the tones. You're absolutely right.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  Absolutely. Well, also...
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  Hold on. Don't hang up. I'm going to come back to you, Emily. And then Sean and Kevin and Jeff and many others that have called in 877-789-2539.

[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:25.000]  These are the very best. You know our body's Ultimate Turmeric formula is amazing? Well, guess what? We now have Turmeric 95. That's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:35.000]  CBD oil of the highest quality. Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high quality full spectrum CBD.
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:50.000]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at infowarstore.com. The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:32:16.000]  InfoWars MD at infowarstore.com.
[02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:24.000]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:50.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America.
[02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:59.000]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:09.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:47.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:59.000]  This is a cult. This is all run by the big banks to make us all fight with each other and kill each other and all these sacks of garbage are going along with this. It's insane.
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  But Emily, going back to detoxing from the parasites, what I know is heat really devastates the spike protein. So does ivermectin, but so does a big regimen of all the things that energize our body.
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:33.000]  So vitamin C, D3, B12, CoQ10, PQQ, but the biggest thing is a lot of water and just being healthy and the good news is I've talked to a lot of scientists and doctors and I've seen it in my own family.
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:39.000]  People that had long COVID, the doctors said take ivermectin again and it got them back to normal.
[02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  They're growing prions similar to spongiform encephalopathy, bad cow disease, the prions do that, folding proteins.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  And so things that counter that and as long as the infection doesn't go too far, it doesn't eat too many brain cells or heart cells, a lot of folks are reversing it.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  You'll still not live as long, it's still going to kill you early, but it won't keep growing and so the damage is done but not more damage. Does that make sense?
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  Yes. You forgot to mention, however, and I have rededicated my life to Jesus Christ through this whole circumstance, but Jesus Christ is the great physician.
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:30.000]  And he put thousands and thousands of cures at our fingertips for this and he would never let Satan overcome us without us having the proper tools.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  God gave us free will, but God's our Father and loves us, so didn't cheat, but gave us the notes of how to pass the test.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:42.000]  That's what revelation is, that's what Mother Earth is, beautifully said. Thank you, Emily.
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  Sean, first time caller in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure to be with you, sir. I've been an info warrior since 1998 with a friend of mine.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  Yes, a friend of mine was a radio station program director and used to play rebroadcasts of your show late at night.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  Here's what I'm getting at. I lost my first Facebook page when you were banned from social media because I used to post a lot of your stuff.
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  I've been talking to friends and family for 25 years now, showing them the world is becoming you in the mainstream media when you see the Steve Bannon and the Tucker Carlson's of the world.
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  Having said that, close friends and family of mine, they just don't get it, Alec. They don't see it.
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:34.000]  A friend of mine I've known for 30 years, I've been pounding the info war at him.
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  He just took his family to get revacked and get the boost again.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  My ex-wife, she's a research scientist for a pharmaceutical company. She's bought into this thing, hook, line, and sinker, man. I just don't know how many more people.
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  Well, people ask, how did Jones know they want six to eight shots a year? Bill Gates said it two and a half years ago.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  I played the clip like 50 times, literally, probably 50 times. It's all been pre-planned.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  In fact, guys, you pulled up the Canadian doctor that lives in the UK and runs the vaccine program there with Pfizer. I forget his name.
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  It gives him the B because the crew is so good. They heard me talk about how it erases immune system.
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:21.000]  David Bauer, this is him two years ago saying, well, we found that the Pfizer and Moderna shots are going to erase your immune system, so you'll always have to add more.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  I mean, did you just hear what he said? You've got to show her this clip. Go ahead, brother.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  Yeah, well, I mean, the buddy of mine that I've been friends with for 30 years, I was showing him stuff when you had Dr. Wallach on, I don't know, 15, 20 years ago, and you guys were talking about the Flexner report.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  This is how far back I've been showing him stuff, but yet he's lining his family up at the slaughter.
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  Because he's under Stockholm syndrome, he can't believe the whole thing's a lie. He can't face it.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  And so I would just move on from him and warn others that he'll listen.
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  Well, I'm shooting it out to everybody, but that's really my call, man. It's a frustration call. I've been on the front line with you since 98.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  Keep pounding away, brother.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  Well, let me raise this to you, Sean. What is it like to see basically everything we warned of come true? That's crazy.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  That is crazy. Well, I mean, I just told a friend of mine who I woke up in 2010.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  I said, you know, Alice Jones is saying, you know, if you're awake, you're walking through hell, but at least you're awake.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:26.000]  And she woke up. She got it instantly, but she's one of those few.
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  Like, I don't know what it was that she got that the others who I've been, like I said, I lost my first Facebook page when you got banned. I got bad.
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.000]  So I don't know, man.
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:43.000]  Well, the answer is start a getter, start a rumble, start a gab.
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:47.000]  Just just keep fighting, brother, and just reach out to people on the ground as well.
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  Thank you so much, Sean. I understand the frustration, but look how far we've come.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:57.000]  Things will be far worse than that one for you, brother. Kevin, first time caller in San Diego, California. Go ahead.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  You the man can't thank you enough for my special Christmas gift. I got my shipment from info or store and there's the giant to Alex Jones Halloween mask.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  This is crazy.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  So I'm going to mount it on the wall in the man cave with the bread laser beams coming out of the eyeballs.
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000]  We love you, brother.
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  Yeah, it's so important. So what I've been dying to ask you is at 9 11, one plane crashed at the Pentagon, no tail section, no engines, the holes in the building didn't match the wingspan of the jet.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  Yeah, the witnesses on scene in that they saw a huge cruise missile ended up like an American Airlines.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  Okay, so then at Shanksville, it's just a big burned hole.
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  At Shanksville, the Air Force refused to follow orders to stand down. That plane was going to the capital. That's why they evacuated it.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  And the Air Force shot it down. They even gave him awards for it.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:05.000]  But where in the FAA tapes where they put two aim nines, those are sidewinder missiles into it.
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  Well, so where did the people go? Like if there was no debris found in Pennsylvania, it was just a singed black hole, no debris at all.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:21.000]  It was actually over about five or six miles. That was a real plane blown up by F 16s in the Air National Guard.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  But but it was a large cruise missile painted up like American Airlines.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  Witnesses saw it and they described it. It was a big cruise missile.
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.000]  And actually an earlier one, like the 80s, they mothballed.
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  It was a long range nuclear cruise missile, but they removed the nuclear head.
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  They didn't know the type design from the descriptions. And then whoever clandestine group had it used that.
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  But then what about the plane that was supposed to the passengers that were on the plane that supposedly hit it?
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  If you look at Operation Northwoods, he describes how to have CIA under fake names, board a plane with one tell number.
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  That plane lands, they get off and then use a drone aircraft to crash and blame it on the Cubans.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  It's just so elaborate the extent they go to. And again, our prayers are that you just stay at it.
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  You're doing everything right. I don't know how you get through the day.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  Brother, we're on a mission. Most people fighting tyranny don't live to see the victory. I'm living to see it. I'm blessed.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  Thanks for keeping me in the attack. Thank you so much, Kevin.
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  Let's jam in one more call. Jeff, first time caller from South Carolina, here on the air.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  Hey, brother.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  Welcome.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  Yeah, I'm like, I'm like the other listeners. I've been around since 2003, so impressed with you.
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  And I don't know how a new time listener cannot be impressed with you knowing about the no hide law, where immigrants go,
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  or how you're, what the shot does in your liver, all that. That's incredible.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  But I would like to say thank you to a doctor. What was his name? Dr. Grove liver guy.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:05.000]  Yeah, thank you to him so much. That's, that's horrible that, that they guys through.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:11.000]  I'm sure other guests that come on your show did too. And also, to ever the lady or gentlemen that said the best point,
[02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  a long time listener, thank you so much. We support Alex, what we can buy in the supplements because who else you want to buy for?
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  Who else do you, who can help you trust?
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  But anyway, what this is interesting on your ex files clip.
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  If you, if you get your producers to look through closely, you'll see on the whiteboard, while they're having a discussion in the background,
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  it says the cure is eye-permitted.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  I didn't see that. Hold on, hold on. I'll have the crew scan through it. Don't hang up.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  That's what's crazy is Chris Carter wanted me to come to LA and meet him and I never did it.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  We talked some and he was like, no, we're on board and there's good people in the CIA that are giving us this information.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:56.000]  And now look back. They gave us everything that happened four years later.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of Infowars under a new brand name, Infowars Platinum.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:17.000]  Now all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:24.000]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail,
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  We're talking about Pain MD. We're talking about HGH Max Boost. We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:56.000]  These things are incredible. I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare provider because they're so powerful.
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  Get them at infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:06.000]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:17.000]  It's election month, Alex. It's not election day. And that's the problem.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  And everything changed after COVID-19. They illegally changed state elections, mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:36.000]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election. We're in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:42.000]  And I believe that just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:54.000]  And it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections shouldn't be run the way they are.
[02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:58.000]  We're not election deniers. We're election realists.
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  So they're going to go from Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the global agenda.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been because of your past support.
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle, free double your efforts by visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  1776, the promo code, the destination is infowarstore.com, and I thank you all for your support.
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:25.000]  On the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases even better.
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:31.000]  Introducing Info Wars MD at infowarstore.com.

[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:56.000]  This is taking superfood greens, this is the highest quality greens out there, and it's at a price way way lower than the same product on store shelves for up to twice the cost.

[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:12.000]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:20.000]  Alright, I'm gonna host 15 minutes to the next hour and hit a bunch of news I haven't hit yet that J.D.R.s would take over 45 minutes at 3 p.m.
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  Owen Schroeder takes over the war room, but I gotta tell you, we had a caller earlier talking about Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA and saying,
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:30.000]  he's got all these government boards and he's got all these elite groups.
[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  Well, I mean, the guy's super rich, he invented a bunch of stuff, he's part of them, he's saying don't take the shot.
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  So just whether he's good or bad, he's saying it's bad, don't take it. He just came out on the war room with Steve Bannon and said,
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  we are under military globalist attack, it's not the Chinese that produced this to put this fake House report out, the Republicans did.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  It's the globalist working with the Chai comms that did it. That's key, so I don't see Malone.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  I mean, how is he bad? He's exposing them. How is he out to get everybody if he's literally risking his life?
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  All of us have been subjected to military-grade psychological operations for three years now. Yes, they admit that.
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  And then we've got all these other incredible reports that I'm gonna hit next hour.
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:24.000]  Melbourne has started installing defibrillators outside homes, making sure every resident is easy access to help with increase and sudden cardiac arrest.
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  I mean, it's in the statistics. It's not debated. We're gonna cover that start of the next hour.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:38.000]  But Jeff, holding over from South Carolina, another point to make. Go ahead, thank you.
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  Yes, sir. Well, I just wanted to let you know that the ivermectin is on the scientist's chalkboard as a cure.
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  Yeah, and we're gonna show that. I got so busy during the break, people are talking to me. They're great talking to me. But let's put it up.
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  The four-minute clip I played in the first hour of the 2016 last X-Files episodes, where Alex Jones is the care attorney.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  He's warning they're gonna put a vaccine in you that destroys your immune system.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:10.000]  Where in the four-minute video is it ivermectin as the cure?
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:17.000]  Because that takes this totally next level, the biggest thing ever. And I'm on an airplane to LA to meet Chris Carter right now.
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  Because I want to know who told him that. Where is it on the billboard? Where is it on the bulletin board?
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  Well, see, I've seen the extended clip where the doctors are in another meeting and there's a whiteboard.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  I can't tell you that it's on your four-minute clip, but it's on somewhere in that show.
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000]  But anyway...
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  Okay, well, we're gonna look that up, because that's huge.
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  I do like your skits, the people jumping back. That was so funny.
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  And if you wanted it, we got Alexa or Alexa. We need to have Alexa and have all these different people from different countries asking their Alexa.
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  And you have so much information you can tell them about the no-hide law, or you can tell them about something going on in Africa or China, either the Alexa.
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:06.000]  You know what I'm saying? Instead of a Siri, you have Alexa or Alex.
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  Great point, sir. Thank you so much for the call.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:11.000]  I believe you, but I'm gonna, like Ronald Reagan said, trust me, verify.
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  I already want to do a whole report on this X-File special.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  Because I forgot, that's like a million years ago, 2016, that Chris Carter came out and said Alex Jones is the hero of the new show.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  I think Alex Jones is good. It's a talk show host, warning of government plots.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  And it's a vaccine that erases your immune system and kills you.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  And then if it says Iver Mectin is the cure in the show, because I want to find the HD version anyway.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  So it's just a quarter clip we've been playing. If that's true, man, that is unbelievable warning from the deep state insiders.
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  Or what is it?
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  Okay, let's talk to Larry. First time caller from Chicago. You're on the air.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  Hi, Alex.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.000]  Glenn.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  Good. Yeah, Alex, I've listened to you for almost 15 years now.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:00.000]  I've got on your coins and your storeable foods and your autograph book and supplements.
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  Thank you.
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:02.000]  That's great.
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000]  You're putting me here without you. Thank you.
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:11.000]  God bless. Thank you. Alex, real quick, I refuse to get any of these COVID shots I have. I've lost friends.
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:16.000]  I have lost friends. They start treating me like typhoid Tommy for not getting them.
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:19.000]  And I said, I'm not going to get them. And I've actually lost friends.
[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:25.000]  What I wanted to ask you real quick is now we got the, every year, you know, they have these seasonal flu shots.
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:32.000]  What's your injection for your seasonal flu shot? And my doctor pings me every so often through their healthcare system.
[02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:37.000]  Oh, it's time you haven't gotten your seasonal flu shot yet and the flu is going to be horrible.
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:42.000]  Now, we're not talking COVID. We're just talking, you know, the flu changes from year to year.
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000]  It's a different strain. It's this and that.
[02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:52.000]  And so, but I'm reluctant. I have other friends too who are reluctant to go get these seasonal flu injections.
[02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:57.000]  As well, they put a needle in you. Absolutely. We're not scared of needles.
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:02.000]  Like, like these left to say, we know the history of tainty vaccines that don't work.
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:07.000]  Every flu shot in history has never guessed the next year's mutation. None of it works.
[02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:12.000]  It lowers your immune system. It makes you sick. That's my view. It's the facts.
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  Look it up yourself. Now, is a tetanus shot real? Yeah, you take a tetanus shot. You're not going to get tetanus for 10 years.
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:22.000]  But that's been linked to them adding sterilant compounds to it as well.
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:27.000]  They create an autoimmune response to a hormone that females produce through the second trimester.
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:31.000]  So all these programs have been weaponized. It's how they're trying to take control of us.
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  And so you're absolutely right. I personally do not take any of these shots.
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:38.000]  I'm not out of that scene since I was like eight years old.
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:42.000]  I stepped on a nail. My dad said, hey, we want to take this tetanus shot. I did it.
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:45.000]  I thought I had a shot since eight years old.
[02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:51.000]  Something real quick. About five years ago, I went and got one of these seasonal flu shots.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:56.000]  And within a week, I had a heart attack. A heart attack.
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.000]  And I was young. I was healthy. I mean, I'm not.
[02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  Oh, yeah. Viruses attack the heart. That's why the CDC in 2000 said we expect heart attacks from these shots. They know.
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:13.000]  Yeah. And I got one. It wasn't the COVID or anything. It was five years ago and I got this.
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:17.000]  By the way, guys, I don't want to interrupt you. Pull up the used to small and clip from yesterday.
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:22.000]  I didn't play in the in the nineties and use of small ones worked in Congress as an archivist.
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:27.000]  He was read into the whole thing by top people. He said these shots are designed to give you heart attacks.
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  They put viruses in your heart that activate later. They may kill you 20 years later, but they knew back then he was told by members of Congress this.
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:41.000]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Anything else?
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:50.000]  No, no. So I will thank you for clarifying that because I'm thinking I'm not going to go get any more of these seasonal flu shots because I like, like you're saying, I just don't trust them.
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:55.000]  I just don't thank you so much for the call. It is a fact.
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:59.000]  Look it up, folks, that no flu shot has ever guessed the next mutation.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:06.000]  It is at least worthless and way worse in the aggregate. Here's use of small ones from the grave.
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:11.000]  It's just the nineties, the eighties. I forget. This is a long time ago. Here it is.
[02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:16.000]  Clark of Indiana. And in this book, I found a very interesting sentence.
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:23.000]  He said, I never saw a case of cancer in an unvaccinated person.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  Now he wrote this in 1936.
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  So to me, that was quite a revelation. And other doctors have said the same thing that vaccination is really a time bomb within the human system that can go off five years, 10 years, 40 years after the vaccination.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  You could have this time bomb go off. You could have a stroke, a heart attack, because it's always there in your system.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  You never get rid of it. And apparently it's always an alien force in your physique.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:02.000]  All right, use of small ones. Dead on as usual, exposing the whole situation. All right.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  Let's jam in another call before I start the next hour. Get to all these clips I mentioned that are so critical.
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  Please stay with us and share these clips. Justin from Ohio, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  Hey, Alex, I've been listening since about 2001. I've been buying all your supplements.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:22.000]  I got near Bell Buckles. I don't know if you remember the Bell Buckles with Washington.
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  Yeah, we should make more of those. Made in America. Yeah, 1776 Bell Buckles.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:38.000]  Yeah. And I mean, I got the whiskey glasses. I got the coins and everything. But yeah, I'm very pleased with how far the, you know, the conservative movement has been getting.
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  I've been bringing a lot of people to Christ.
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  Exactly. As negative as stuff is, our message is now mainline. We've successfully gotten conservatives to wake up. That's a big deal.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:57.000]  Yes, very much so. Well, I wanted to have your insight and your points on Charlie Ward, his website's Charlieward.tv.
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:03.000]  He says that we're working on a quantum financial system separate of the CBDC.
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  And he says that it's supposed to be so much more, I guess, user-friendly in the sense of it's going to be for benefit instead of against us.
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  I just wondered if you had any insight towards that. There's also a government website, which is quantum.gov, kind of goes into a little bit of that information.
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  We'll quantify what you're saying. I mean, I know there's a bunch of competing central-magnetial currencies, a bunch of other competing currencies.
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:33.000]  That's obviously what they're trying to force on us. I'm not against technological development, but all of it has backdoors.
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:37.000]  What are you asking me specifically?
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:43.000]  Well, okay, so I've seen the guy on the Threat Times show with Clay Clark. He's been at the reawaken America tour and things.
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  And he says we're getting ready to move to this quantum financial system, which we'll bring in the beginning of this rainbow currency or something they're talking about, which is packed by gold and silver.
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:57:00.000]  But it is also somehow connected to the ethos in some fashion, which is the reason why it's called the quantum financial system.
[02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  Well, I know they got quantum computing coming out, and I know they want programmable tokens to track everything you do. I think it's all bad.
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  It's all going to be used for bad. It's all terrible. We should learn all about it and have alternative systems because barter and rural communities are going to be the future.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  I mean, the real secret is getting back to being humans and anti-technology. I'm not against technology, but the technology's been jacked. It's been hijacked. It's how they get you.
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  And of course, here I'm in a high tech facility, you know, I'm reaching you through that. I mean, it's all hypocritical. I'm just saying that is the end game goal.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:37.000]  All right. Thank you.
[02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:48.000]  I can't pronounce this name. Macabus and Nick and Sean. And then I got a bunch of breaking news coming up.
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history of InfoWars under a new brand name, InfoWars Platinum.
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for the last few years because they work so well.
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:19.000]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:26.000]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores. We're talking about Payne MD. We're talking about HGH MaxBoost.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:44.000]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost. These things are incredible. I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and consult your health care provider.
[02:58:44.000 --> 02:59:09.000]  Those are so powerful. Get them at infowarstore.com.
[02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:14.000]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:20.000]  They then give us the best deal out there because the owner is a listener and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:25.000]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:31.000]  You're not going to find at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram, you're not going to find two-market 95% of humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:40.000]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that. These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[02:59:40.000 --> 03:00:05.000]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near the price we're selling it.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  All right, McCabeus. I'm going to go to you and a few others and then I'm going to get some final news and the great Jay Dyer is going to take over.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  McCabeus in Zion. Wherever that is, it's over here. Go ahead.
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:36.000]  If people have access to the thermal waters, the soak, that's a good way to get that out of your system. A hydrogen machine or if you don't have money for a hydrogen machine, you could get the hydrogen tablets.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  Our body is more hydrogen than anything by volume.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  Also, watch what you eat because over the pandemic, they approve a bunch of garbage into our food and that's what's helping grow the parasites.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  That is what's helping grow all the diseases. We have to get right back to God.
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  What he created, not all these weird plants, these weird animals genetically engineered nonsense that has no affinity with our biology.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  You're talking about collars earlier, talking about how to detoxify from the poison shots to spike protein.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  Correct. Correct.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:32.000]  People get back to God and people want to know why you can't talk any sense to these people. It's because they've been given over to a strong delusion.
[03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:36.000]  They're not in love with the truth. They're committed to the lie.
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:40.000]  No, you're right. The Bible explains that and they are giving over to the delusion.
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  Absolutely.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  Is there any way to reach out to them or do you just move on?
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  Honestly, you could pray for them, but it's on them to accept the truth.
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:54.000]  You can, like I said, it goes both ways, too.
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  These people that think that Trump is the Messiah and all this other craziness, it's just like, it's both ways.
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  The demon rats and the Republicans.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  No, I agree. I mean, look, look, look, look.
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  If Trump put out a training card and just made it no big deal, be fine. But he said big announcement and did this. It's a joke.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  Right. And, and I mean, if, if, if we were riding in a car together and one of us had a brick of cocaine on one of us, all of us would go to jail.
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  He's part of it. Even though he's, silence is worse than the Bible.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:38.000]  Well, you know, real polls show everywhere to say this is 10, 15, 30 points at him to put on the poll.
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  All because Trump stayed wedded to that vaccine and, you know, Trump did to himself.
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  And he took a million dollars from Pfizer.
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:56.000]  When, when, when, when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was supposed to head up the vaccine safety summit or the vaccine safety committee, then he runs across Bill Gates.
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  Bill Gates tells him not to look into vaccines today.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  The shines wearing off Trump real quick. So he's to get it together or bye bye. Thank you.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  He needs to be, he needs to be hanging from a rope.
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  I appreciate your call. Let's talk to Sean in West Virginia. Go ahead.
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  What's going on, man? Big fan. Listen for probably 20 years since I was in fourth grade. So, you know,
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  Good to have you here, brother. Well, now you're, now you're, what are you, 30 years old?
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  26, dude. Good to have you here.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:36.000]  Awesome. Well, hey, man, look, I just got a question, you know, I'm a soldier, you know, I work in the DoD.
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  I do a lot of different shit, but I just, I've got to ask, man, what can we actually do on a personal level to make a difference?
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:48.000]  And if it's possible, how do we help out with the Info Wars mission?
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  Like really, if you're just get close to God, that's the Holy Spirit to guide you and speak out and tell the truth and promote a pro human future.
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:04:02.000]  I mean, there's a anti-human takeover happening. You can debate all day what's behind it, but it's definitely going on, brother.
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:12.000]  God, man. Well, appreciate everything you do. I just, you know, if you have one message to, you know, put out to, you know, young guys like myself,
[03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  fathers, husbands, what is it? You know, I know just...
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  I would get on your knees, I would get on your knees morning, noon and night, and you know, just take five minutes out and close the door
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  and the skillier needs to say, God, what do I do? Give me discernment. What can I do where I'm at? And God will give you the answer.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:34.000]  So I just say, don't ask Alex Jones what to do. Ask God what to do. And God's going to answer.
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  All right, man. Appreciate you.
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  Appreciate you, brother. And I give a lot of advice, but I think we should do.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  God bless you. I'm sorry we're having to hurry through calls here.
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:48.000]  I got to hit these clips and then I'm going to finish it with Nick and then J. Dyer takes over, always informative.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:56.000]  Today, whether this will be right back, final segment I'm doing, and then I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 8 p.m. Central in FullWars.com.
[03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:29.000]  This is through a network of community pharmacies in home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products

[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:55.000]  Alright, let's hit these three final videos for J. Dyer and take some over and I'm going to jam in one more call from Nick.
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:07:02.000]  This is Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technology that out of the gate said don't take the shot and I think he's a good guy.
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:05.000]  We've heard some of those whisper campaigns, he's not good or whatever.
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:08.000]  He used to be at the very top of it, he used to be one of the top people. I mean what's he doing?
[03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:13.000]  Well, I mean if we don't expect people of the power structure to come over to our side, what do we expect?
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:18.000]  Can't ever have defectors if you're mean to them all and I'm just saying that here because I'm sick of the infighting.
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:26.000]  Here he is talking about the admitted psychological warfare operation run by the militaries of the western world on record against the people.
[03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000]  That's illegal here it is.
[03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:38.000]  What he's talking about is that the governor's office and the attorney general's office are the ones driving this. They're working very closely together on this.
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:47.000]  And I think the big reveal there was Ron DeSantis referencing the financial settlements that the state has obtained having to do with the opioid crisis.
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:56.000]  They're taking on big pharma in a major way. Whatever you think about the politics and I don't want to get into the Trump DeSantis and all that little scuffle.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:00.000]  That's your bailiwick's deal. I don't have any opinion on that.
[03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:06.000]  But there clearly has been a problem with transparency and with privileged communications.
[03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:18.000]  And I think there's a reasonable chance that this panel under as an investigatory grand jury under the Florida Supreme Court,
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:27.000]  empowered by the governor's office and the attorney general's office for the state of Florida, which is independent of Joe Lattapo and his public health group,
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  is going to uncover some key information that we have been that has been withheld from all of us by as you correctly point out this concerted propaganda campaign.
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:52.000]  I like to point out all of us have been subjected to military grade psychological operations for three years now.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:09:03.000]  We have experienced fifth generation warfare deployed against the American citizens using technology that was developed for offshore fifth generation warfare,
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:12.000]  information warfare, and it's been deployed against us and it's time for us to get down to the bottom of this and get the real answers.
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:20.000]  Very powerful, very true. Now here's another chilling clip. Massive increases in heart attacks, blood clots, you all know about.
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:32.000]  Here is national Australian news. Melbourne has started installing defibrillators outside homes, making sure every resident has easy access to help with the increase in sudden cardiac arrest.
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:35.000]  And it's the so-called vaccinated. Here it is.
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  North has become the first in Australia to roll out a life-saving street tool.
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:48.000]  Defibrillators have been installed outside homes, increasing survival rates of cardiac arrests.
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  A life-saving machine is now within walking distance for every resident in reservoir.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  Every home is now within 400 metres of a defibrillator and over 3,000 people have been trained in CPR.
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  27 defibrillators have been rolled out at homes around the suburb, transforming the fifth deadliest area for cardiac arrests into the safest.
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  Sudden cardiac arrest affects and impacts almost anybody. It doesn't matter, it's not about age, it's not about gender.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  It is simply a killer across the board.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:30.000]  Over 6,500 sudden cardiac arrests occur in Victoria each year. 80% happen in the home.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  CPR within the first six minutes is crucial and coupled with a defibrillator, it increases survival rates to over 50%.
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  Start CPR. Rest, rest, rest.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:48.000]  Just 11 months into the Australian first trial, it's already saved a man's life.
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:51.000]  Friends of his were able to come over, know the details.
[03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:58.000]  So they hit you with a bio-weapon, destroy your heart and then keep you alive to get more money off of you once you get to the hospital.
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  It is just full-spectrum criminal activity. Now let's go to this.
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  This is out of the township there in Pennsylvania, upper Mordland township, saying we cannot elect someone to the board to be the president because he's a straight white male.
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  This is saying the quiet part out loud that white men are inherently evil. Here it is.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:27.000]  Having said that, I believe that Mr. DeLeo would make an excellent president.
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  However, I feel that electing the only cis white male on this board president of this district sends the wrong message to our community.
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:50.000]  A message that is contrary to what we as a board have been trying to accomplish.
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  I think that it's important that we practice what we preach and that our words have strength when they are spoken.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  Whether we speak them from the neighborhood sidewalks or from the homeless tables.
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:12.000]  So all your rights are being taken, you're being surveilled, you're being poisoned and murdered, but a big, giant, fat, weird woman says we're going to stop the white males.
[03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  When it's the white, globalist males running all of this or Xi Jinping over in China running it. Disgusting criminal activity saying that white people that are male cannot have a job.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:30.000]  Then a bunch of crazy women are going to sign on to the megacorporations and the robot takeover.
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:34.000]  I mean, because they know they'll run right over her.
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:40.000]  That Western male boy, they sure fear that because it's beaten them before.
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:44.000]  Because it came out of the same power structure, but there's good and bad in any group.
[03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:48.000]  So they're getting rid of the good side so the bad side can rule it.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:13:00.000]  And the dominant force will be what's left of the British Empire, powerful Jewish mafias, powerful megacorporations, and the Chaikom mafia.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000]  And that's it. Nobody else.
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:05.000]  Well, they don't say you can't have a Jewish guy the head of the ADL.
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000]  I mean, he's a white guy. Oh, no, no, no, he's great.
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:11.000]  Or, oh, Israel has laws against race missing. Well, that's okay for them.
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  But, oh my goodness, we can't have a white male who's now these gay, that's okay.
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:20.000]  Or maybe he's a pedophile. It's okay.
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  She heard, well, you can't have straight white males here on the board.
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:27.000]  You just, you can't do that.
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000]  So, because they're inherently evil.
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  I mean, just listen to what you're being taught. Listen to what you're being told.
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:40.000]  And by the ADL, that is a racial mafia, a racial group that says it represents Jews.
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  I love everybody.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  But look how you have a racial mafia of the ADL teaching white kids they're bad.
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  And we just sit here and we take it and we take it.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:54.000]  Keep us on air, folks, share the article, share the videos, buy the great products, two new lines,
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:14:04.000]  InfoWarsMD and InfoWars Platinum Now. Do your Christmas shopping with infowars.com, infowarsstore.com.
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:06.000]  I thank you all for your support.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  Let's jam in Nick, first-time caller from Massachusetts to close this out before Jadire takes over. Go ahead.
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  Hey, Alex. Just wanted to call in a first-time caller and listening only for about a year now.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:24.000]  This is just in regards to these communication towers causing cancer and stuff.
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:30.000]  I live in a town in Massachusetts. They're trying to put up another one of these towers.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:38.000]  Just a little backstory. I lived in this small neighborhood and about 20 people in this neighborhood got cancer.
[03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  And it was all different types of cancer.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  And our community tried to get lawyers together and they tried to go after this communications company.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  And bottom, you know, long story short, they got nowhere with it.
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  There was this one lady that lived across the street from me and she just wouldn't let it go.
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:04.000]  Her daughter got leukemia and she just kept going after it.
[03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  She eventually, I guess, she got admitted into a psychiatric hospital.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  Of course.
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  All the studies say 5G causes massive cancer.
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:23.000]  Whether you're Jewish or German or Christian or Muslim, it kills everybody, but it's liberal, so it's loving.
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  Yeah, so Alex, but I think they, I think because she kept going after this, she said that the FBI was in the freeze watching her.
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:35.000]  I think they tried to silence her for trying to keep...
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:42.000]  And harass people and make them sound crazy because the FBI is not watching anybody. Of course, now we know they run Twitter and Facebook and everything and censor us.
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:45.000]  Yeah, no. I mean, this is a scientific takeover. God bless you.
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  In FullWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  Share those links.
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:52.000]  Jadar takes over on the other side of the break. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:04.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the Globals.
[03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:10.000]  We've come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:15.000]  We are engaging the Globals at point-blank range in the information war.
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:17.000]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:24.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support in FullWars are the real reason we've had the success.
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:29.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:34.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:39.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:43.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:46.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you.
[03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:52.000]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this streak is happening.
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:57.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.

[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:28.000]  This was a lack of vitamin D3. You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:32.000]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3.
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:37.000]  And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:42.000]  So now it's more important than ever because the winner is here to take high quality vitamin D3.

[03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:12.000]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:21.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest. So it's Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis and we've covered a lot of the global elite writings in the fourth hour of Alex Jones.
[03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:33.000]  And in the first hour, you heard Alex talking about the power of Hollywood to predictively program us to be prepared for the next layer or level of propaganda that they want to push.
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:38.000]  And that's something that I've covered in depth because I heard Alex talking about it so many years ago and did two books on that.
[03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:44.000]  So one of the books that we haven't covered that relates directly to this is Edward Bernays's book Propaganda.
[03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  So I want to talk a little bit about that and then I want to go into how our opinions and our attitudes are formed by, as he says, people who we never see, who exist as a kind of invisible government.
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:00.000]  He even uses that kind of terminology in the book.
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:11.000]  And we're going to talk about how Hollywood functions in that way and that close longtime linkage, that marriage between Hollywood and the CIA, the military and various intelligence agencies.
[03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:17.000]  Bernays begins his famous book and if you don't know, he's the relative of Sigmund Freud.
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:28.000]  And Bernays was at the Department of War, as it used to be called for a while before it became the Department of Defense, something that he renamed so that he retitled to make it more palatable.
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:37.000]  And he begins his book on propaganda by noting that our attitudes are formed, he says.
[03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:52.000]  We are governed, he says, by in a democratic society by the masses are governed by our minds molded by our tastes formed by our ideas largely made, he says, by men that we have never heard or seen.
[03:21:52.000 --> 03:22:02.000]  This is the logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they're to live together in a functioning society.
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:09.000]  Thus our invisible government, he says, is who runs our ideology.
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:18.000]  And then he goes on to talk about famous stories of made up fake, fake news, fake news within the first few pages.
[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:31.000]  He talks about fake news stories and he talks about how a lot of the techniques that the propagandists and the social engineers and the people at Madison Avenue, the advertising men, if you've seen the movie, the show Mad Men, right?
[03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:44.000]  That's kind of taking place within that time frame when he's writing about people coming out of the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA, these admin going into working at places like Madison Avenue, Hollywood.
[03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:50.000]  He mentions Walter Lipman coming out of the OSS precisely to do this kind of stuff.
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:23:04.000]  He mentions the wartime techniques and psychological warfare that were understood to be effective were then applied to mass media pop culture in the advertising world and particularly to Hollywood.
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:20.000]  The new propagandist he talks about is mass media and the rise of mass media back when he was writing this, I guess, in the data when this was back in the 30s, 40s, somewhere in there.
[03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:29.000]  And he talks about how movies would be an amazing way to propagandize people because movies are what the masses see.
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:34.000]  It's movies that propagandize us even at times without us even knowing at a subconscious level.
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:41.000]  They program, in a way, our subconscious through the usage and manipulation of various archetypes.
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:44.000]  And so movies are, he says, a powerful form of propaganda.
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  There's even a little joke he makes about how even presidents are manipulated and run by people in the background who manipulate and turn them through an invisible government to various ways
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  that they may not have intended to go.
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:07.000]  So even presidents can be manipulated, he says, by propaganda when it's very scientifically powerful and precise.
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:09.000]  He talks about fashion trends.
[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:13.000]  He talks about sexual mores and revolutions.
[03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:19.000]  All of these things can be done through pop culture and through movies to completely change the society.
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:30.000]  He goes into a lot of other things, too, like ad campaigns, surveys, he says, all these things can be easily manipulated, faked, made up, right?
[03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:40.000]  And he says, this is really the psychology of public manipulation and public relations, which is based on herd mentality and groupthink.
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:51.000]  And he says that his relative Freud was instrumental in helping to figure out how to utilize archetypal sexual things to manipulate and to sell things, right?
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  Sex and advertising.
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:55.000]  No, this should all be pretty self-evident to most of us, I think, right?
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  And he mentions a lot of examples of things that he cooked up that were very successful, like soap sculptures and how this actually ended up selling a bunch of bars of soap as a test.
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:16.000]  And he talks about how the idea of enlightened self-interest that was the motor software under the Rand Corporation would be sold upon everybody to promote the idea of consumerism.
[03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  He says that all areas of life would be controlled by the ideas of commodification and business.
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:24.000]  Everything is business.
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  And he says that the notion of advertising and advertising campaigns are essentially the exact same thing as propaganda.
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:45.000]  And he says that the only difference is that it's being used not to sell a ward or change people's minds during warfare, but to sell the invisible government's ideology.
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:54.000]  And he's referring to people in the deep state. He's talking about the people that he was cohorts with coming out of the OSS and the CIA.
[03:25:54.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  And so today we heard in that clip that Alex played this going around on Twitter, we heard Tucker Carlson talking about how the JFK files vindicate what people have been saying for so long that this, quote, deep state had a key hand in the assassination of JFK.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:13.000]  That's a huge vindication.
[03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  In fact, I think the first or second, maybe the first time I came on the fourth hour to host almost two years ago, I did a whole talk on the CIA, the mafia and JFK and their connections to Hollywood.
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  There's Tucker giving this report.
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:28.000]  And guess what?
[03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  It was everything I said, right?
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  At least what we know so far in regard to Tucker's brief report there is exactly what I told you two years ago.
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:38.000]  And what's the point of this?
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:43.000]  Well, just like in that report, right, we had a lot of movies that told us this ahead of time.
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:46.000]  Oliver Stone's JFK basically told us this.
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  We had movies for many decades, not just determining trends and determining our, our wants and our desires, but movies that were actually telling us that there was a deep state.
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:08.000]  Movies that were telling us that there was this apparatus of shadowy syndicate individuals, particularly people in the intelligence stage.
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:14.000]  These are the work for private families and for the international banking cartels that actually run things.
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:20.000]  And I was going to, you guys read my mind because I was going to go to Kubrick next.
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  In fact, he goes on in this book to talk about that there was no more powerful propaganda than Hollywood itself.
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:34.000]  Now, Hollywood is kind of declined in modern times, but he says that Hollywood and movies are better than politics.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  There's a whole section, a whole chapter on movies and how movies manipulate us.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  And he says that where are we being manipulated to?
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:42.000]  Guess what?
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:45.000]  It's everything you've heard me talk about in all the other books that we've covered.
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:52.000]  He ends the book by talking about a managerial technocratic society is where it's all taking us.
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:27:58.000]  And so in order to get everybody to a managerial technocratic society, everybody needs to be in Plato's cave,
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:07.000]  needs to be remaining in the matrix to be remaining fixed upon the shadows and the phantasms that dance upon the cave wall.
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:20.000]  That's Plato's ancient allegory in the Republic and in other places that explains our society that's dominated by mass media, Hollywood, the music industry as well.
[03:28:20.000 --> 03:28:23.000]  And in the last few years, this has more and more come out.
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:35.000]  We just saw a couple weeks ago, Britney Spears, yay, talking about handlers, talking about things that people in the alternative media have been talking about for 10, 15, 20 years.
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:37.000]  And now it's public knowledge.
[03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:49.000]  And we're going to get more into that when we look at some of the books that explain how it is that there's this deep relationship between Hollywood, the deep state, the CIA, other intelligence agencies,
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:54.000]  and how they not only program us, but they also predictively program us.
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:29:23.000]  We're going to go into that. Don't go anywhere. This is The Alex Jones Show.

[03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:34.000]  Welcome back to the Ox Jones Show. This is your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jason Alces. We were talking about that relationship between Hollywood, the CIA, the deep state, and even organized crime in regard to people like Frank Sinatra and JFK and Sam Giancona, the head of the Chicago mafia and their relationship to Marilyn Monroe.
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:50.000]  And love Tris that was going on there that might have contributed to some of the downfalls, well at least in the case of Marilyn Monroe perhaps, to her downfall and death because she might have been involved in some of this honey trap operation type of stuff to blackmail people.
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:52.000]  That's my theory on that.
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  But regardless, Marilyn Monroe had a Department of Defense badge and she would, she had access to Wonderland Studios, which was over, if you go up Wonderland Avenue in the area of Hollywood, of Mulholland Drive, you get to this area which was the premiere film studio of that time back in the 40s, 50s, and 60s.
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:38.000]  And that was the Air Force's studio. And, you know, so many high level people in Hollywood like Walt Disney and Jimmy Stewart, Kerry Grant, they all had special access to this high quality, super advanced film studio, which showed that even at that time there was a really deep marriage between what we could call the
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:49.000]  military industrial complex for the deep state and Hollywood. So this is not something that's new. It didn't start developing in the 1980s, the 90s. It was always there. It just wasn't well known.
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:59.000]  And that's, as we said, why so many Hollywood people throughout all these decades had such close relationships with the intelligence agencies and were in fact spies.
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:10.000]  And I did maybe two episodes back of the fourth hour. If you search my name on Bandai Video, you'll get all my lectures in my fourth hour. You'll find the one where we covered famous Hollywood spies.
[03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:28.000]  I'm not going to rehearse all that, but I'm just trying to illustrate that you understand that this helps to explain and vindicate and back up the point that Alex is making the first hour about the fact that the movies and the actors at times are involved in serving
[03:35:28.000 --> 03:35:38.000]  other masters to propagandize us and to change culture, culture creation, culture manipulation.
[03:35:38.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  So again, Jimmy Stewart, Errol Flynn, Kerry Grant, John Houston, Julia Child, Coco Chanel, Sonia Wiegert, Christopher Lee, Marilyn Monroe, Walt Disney, Ian Fleming, John Wayne even was really, we don't know for sure if he was in the OSS, but he really wanted to be in the OSS.
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:02.000]  What does that tell us? Well, that again shows us that there's this deep connection.
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:17.000]  And I'm not saying that everybody who is involved in that is a bad person. That's not the point. The point is that that was a way that people were co-opted into this to give the impression that you're going to be fighting for freedom and fighting for your country and all this kind of stuff.
[03:36:17.000 --> 03:36:22.000]  And it makes sense why they would believe that during the Cold War especially or during World War II times, sure.
[03:36:22.000 --> 03:36:31.000]  But the point is that that relationship didn't go away. After war time, it's like, oh, okay, we don't do that anymore. We're not interested in propaganda.
[03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:34.000]  We're just going to let people make the arts the way they want to do it.
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:51.000]  No, it's always a manipulated thing. And that's why I wrote a significant part of my first book on Ian Fleming because he's one of the best examples of somebody from high level naval intelligence in the British Empire writing all these bond stories about real operations.
[03:36:51.000 --> 03:37:01.000]  And sometimes they're pretty close to what happened. And a lot of times he's adding in propaganda elements and saying, oh, Spectre is doing this. This amorphous, unknown group.
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  No, the people running James Bond are Spectre in the real world. That's how it really works because British intelligence set up the OSS and the CIA.
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:13.000]  Did you know that?
[03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  Well, if you watch The Good Shepherd, another example of this revelation of the method in film, The Good Shepherd actually tells you that because the Matt Damon character representing the early founders of the CIA or the OSS,
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:40.000]  they're trained by British intelligence and British intelligence operatives tell them how to do it, how to set all this up, how to set up this inner deep state model, which is modeled on the round table models of the British Empire.
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:56.000]  Inner core steering committees, inner parties, what Quigley calls the society of the elect model on Cecil Rhodes and Lord Rothschild's special secret society on record in all of Quigley's books.
[03:37:56.000 --> 03:38:02.000]  Well, not all of them, but all the relevant ones, Trajan Hope and Anglo-American establishment.
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:12.000]  So that's how you control a vast empire, but give it the face of democracy and freedom.
[03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  And you do it behind the scenes through a vast network of manipulators, controllers, the managerial class. Rothkopf has a book that it's a few thousand people that manage the world.
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:32.000]  And that's somebody coming out of the circles of Kissinger. That's not a conspiracy theorist.
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:37.000]  And so many movies have actually shown us this. That's the weird part, right?
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:46.000]  That's what Alex was talking about in the first hour, that revelation of the method that the films actually show everybody how it really works.
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:49.000]  And there's a lot of theories as to why they do that.
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:59.000]  There's the idea that, well, from an occult perspective, you're giving a kind of lesser magic, you're doing lesser magic by saying what you're going to do.
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:11.000]  From a psychological warfare perspective, it prepares people, they get acclimatized to it, it becomes normalized, and they accept it when you roll out the propaganda down the road.
[03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:19.000]  Let me give you an example of a movie I just watched that will be doing a breakdown in the near future that's a little more detailed.
[03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:29.000]  But in 2016, a movie came out that kind of a minor, I think it was a theatrical release, science fiction film from Luke Scott, the son of Ridley Scott,
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:35.000]  who, of course, Ridley Scott's films, especially something like Prometheus, has a lot of revelation in it, Blade Runner, a lot of revelation.
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:44.000]  And it done a lot of analyses and essays on Blade Runner and Prometheus telling us about panspermia and how the elite really view things.
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  Well, in this 2016 movie, Morgan, with Anya Taylor Joy, she plays this hybrid DNA-modified creature.
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:06.000]  And in this film, she is kind of going haywire, and they don't really understand why she's freaking out, but as we progress through the film's narrative,
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  it turns out that she's an experiment where a corporation, a private corporation, has altered her DNA to make her a sort of hybrid between human and synthetic, silicon-based AI or whatever.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:28.000]  And now the corporation patents and owns her.
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:40.000]  So, in other words, synthetic nanotech DNA. This is actually in the movie. This is, again, four years before the coof, four years before any pandemics, and the stabbies.
[03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:59.000]  And we're told that this alteration now creates a new kind of being, and the corporation in the film is trying to perfect the perfect future human to create an immortal human, to create a human being that is no longer bound by emotions.
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:13.000]  And I'll give you a little bit of spoiler. In the film, Morgan, it turns out that the main character, Morgan, the Anya Taylor Joy character, she is actually slated to be killed because she's a defective model.
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:21.000]  And the assassin that is sent from the corporation to kill her is the new model, the one that doesn't have the flaws.
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:30.000]  In other words, the new human beings are the ones that will be modified to have no emotions, to have no feelings, to be able to kill without compunction.
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  It's sort of a spurred 9,000 or something, right? No emotions. Everything is just like a machine.
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:42.000]  And so the model that still has human elements has to be gotten rid of.
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:55.000]  This is really the ideology and the plan of the tech elite of the transhumanists. They're open about that. I don't know for sure exactly what all the stabbies and the mRNA manipulation stuff is doing.
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:42:04.000]  I don't think any of us knows for sure. So there's a lot of theories and it looks like in some of the cases there is experimentation at the genetic level going on for sure, right?
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  The gene therapies are experiments. What exactly they're doing? We're trying to figure that out.
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:18.000]  We're having a lot of adverse effects. We know if you watch the documentary about people dying suddenly, for example.
[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:31.000]  But there's also the possibility that beyond that, which has been reported on and even by the World Economic Forum, they had a whole article on mRNA technology and how it's kind of experimental.
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:37.000]  Even they admit that, right? So they're telling you this. But in this movie, that's exactly what's going on.
[03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:44.000]  So it's amazing to me that this is in this film. I never really even paid attention to this film when it came out. I just thought it was another sci-fi film.
[03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:54.000]  And you're watching it and it's like, oh, they're actually telling us that the plan is to use nanotech to alter people's DNA, which is something DARPA had talked about for many decades.
[03:42:54.000 --> 03:42:57.000]  Don't go anywhere. This is the Oxygen Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:10.000]  There's a war against our masculinity. There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  But through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:23.000]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer now.
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:32.000]  We've never put anything out as powerful. It's InfoWars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:43.000]  This is private labeled, three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  How many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez? How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:31.000]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:37.000]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:45.000]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.

[03:46:38.000 --> 03:47:04.000]  We'll see you in the next video.
[03:47:08.000 --> 03:47:14.000]  Welcome back to The Ox Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:29.000]  Jay's analysis, we're talking about how Hollywood and music industry and mass media program us and utilize this principle of predictive programming or sort of putting things into film ahead of time to predict the events that come down the road.
[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:38.000]  Oftentimes in science fiction movies, for example, to prepare us for the surveillance, the microchips, or whatever they want to roll out, the nanotech, right?
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:45.000]  We were just talking about a film from 2016 that had this nanotech theme in it that alters human DNA.
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:48:00.000]  And this is again because they had seen back in the days of Edward Bernays the power of Hollywood to program and to create trends and to cause people to want to act like James Bond and to act like this or that person.
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:15.000]  And even to the point of cartoons, as you see there, because characters from who were involved in the creation of the G.I. Joe series were also working and consulting with the Pentagon.
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:21.000]  I did a whole lecture several years ago in the UK on this. I was invited to speak at a big event there.
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:33.000]  And you can find that lecture on YouTube. I went into about an hour and 20 minutes of propaganda from the history of science fiction that was preparing us for all the things that they eventually wanted to roll out.
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:39.000]  For example, the Rand Corporation consulted on TV shows like Star Trek.
[03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:52.000]  And so there's always been this reciprocal relationship between the people that do science fiction, the people that do G.I. Joe and toys, working with and consulting with the military, DARPA, Pentagon, etc.
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:49:00.000]  If you watch, or excuse me, if you watch my lectures that I did lecturing through Annie Jacobson's big 600 page history of DARPA,
[03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:16.000]  the book concludes with the chapter about her and James Cameron and Kathleen Kennedy and some other Hollywood people going to DARPA to consult on the future of technology and how that relates to Hollywood.
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:24.000]  So the last chapter of that book was a vindication of everything I've been talking about for so many years and my research and what I got into in undergrad and grad school.
[03:49:24.000 --> 03:49:31.000]  But to again hammer this home, there's other people who've been writing on this at an academic level for many years.
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:39.000]  It didn't start becoming well known until maybe the early 2000s and right after 9-11, there was a book that came out called Operation Hollywood.
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:53.000]  And the point of Operation Hollywood was to just focus on the liaison offices between various intelligence agencies and the military and how they consult and revise movie scripts.
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:50:05.000]  This was way before the 2016 or 2017 declassification or a FOIA request for the documents that showed the thousands of examples.
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:14.000]  Maybe it was hundreds, but maybe a few thousand examples that were declassified through FOIA request in the book, National Security Cinema,
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:24.000]  that showed that the Pentagon, the military, the deep state, etc., they had consulted on and put messaging into all kinds of shows for decades, hundreds of them,
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:29.000]  which is what we already knew, but now it's confirmed through those declassified documents.
[03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  But this book came out in 2004 and it's by a bunch of academics just analyzing how Hollywood is told what to do and told what to say in many cases,
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  or they don't get access to this or that aircraft carrier, this or that tank or whatever,
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:50.000]  or they don't get money that they would get for having positive messages about this or that.
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:57.000]  And so that kind of opened the doorway in the academic world to this kind of an idea, this kind of analysis.
[03:50:57.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  And so what you think is some sort of kooky, crazy thing, maybe this is the first time you're hearing about this,
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:11.000]  this is actually studied by academics at an academic level. In 2012, an important book came out,
[03:51:11.000 --> 03:51:17.000]  and it's printed by University of Texas, UT, down there where Austin, where Alex is in Austin,
[03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:22.000]  and it's called C.I. in Hollywood by Trisha Jenkins, who's a professor.
[03:51:22.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  So this is not academic, this is not kook stuff, this is academic stuff,
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:34.000]  and this is a history of the relationship between these entities and how people like Jennifer Garner and J.J. Abrams
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:42.000]  were consulting with the CIA about how to do the show alias and how to make the plots based on real things to a degree.
[03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:47.000]  And if you've never seen alias, I did a whole breakdown of that show with my wife, Jamie, on my YouTube channel.
[03:51:47.000 --> 03:51:51.000]  We went through the episodes of alias and did a full on breakdown.
[03:51:51.000 --> 03:52:00.000]  But again, the point is that this is well known and it's only become more and more revelatory and self-evident as time goes by.
[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:13.000]  So for example, if you remember the film Argo, Argo is a movie about the CIA making a movie as a cover under the Iranian Revolution.
[03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:18.000]  So the film was a cover, oh, we're going to go and film a sci-fi movie in Iran.
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:25.000]  That was a cover that the CIA was doing during the Iranian Revolution for the hostages.
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  So the irony here is that Ben Affleck, of course, who made that film, he won the Oscar for that film Argo.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:36.000]  Not only did the CIA consult on that film, it looks like again,
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:40.000]  Ben Affleck seems to have a really interesting relationship in that regard, right?
[03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:45.000]  Just like his, I guess, ex-wife Jennifer Garner, right?
[03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  And so it's telling you, Argo is telling you how Hollywood and the CIA are connected at the hip and always have been.
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:53:01.000]  Other movies it's come out were not just consulted on, but basically made as CIA propaganda movies.
[03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:05.000]  Zero Dark Thirty, one of the most famous examples.
[03:53:05.000 --> 03:53:07.000]  All admitted.
[03:53:07.000 --> 03:53:11.000]  Movies like American Sniper consulted on.
[03:53:11.000 --> 03:53:15.000]  This is basically a propaganda film is all it is.
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:18.000]  And I'm not saying that the people that are pro-America or bad people, I'm not saying that.
[03:53:18.000 --> 03:53:22.000]  I'm just saying that you have to understand that this is what the movies function as.
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:24.000]  And they've always functioned that way.
[03:53:24.000 --> 03:53:25.000]  It's nothing new.
[03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:29.000]  It's just become more and more evident, more and more clear as time goes by.
[03:53:29.000 --> 03:53:37.000]  When Angelina Jolie was filming Salt, she had a CIA handler assigned to her to teach her tradecraft, to teach her all this stuff, right?
[03:53:37.000 --> 03:53:41.000]  Who's written famous by books, Melissa Mela.
[03:53:41.000 --> 03:53:49.000]  So what I did was I wrote a book on this, Soterek Hollywood, explained the relationship between all these things and documenting it.
[03:53:49.000 --> 03:53:51.000]  I think I put 400 or so footnotes in my book.
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:54.000]  So it's an academic, but also readable text.
[03:53:54.000 --> 03:53:59.000]  And I walk through all these different directors and their connections and what they were.
[03:53:59.000 --> 03:54:00.000]  And they're not all bad people.
[03:54:00.000 --> 03:54:03.000]  I mean, I think at times this might have led to their demise.
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:13.000]  If you watch the movie Wag of the Dog, you'll notice that the director in that movie played by Dustin Hoffman gets killed.
[03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:21.000]  And that's because he's not doing the bidding of the Robert De Niro character who's telling the movie director what to do.
[03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:25.000]  I'm not saying they tell every movie director what to do, but the big blockbuster stuff.
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:28.000]  Yeah, this is where it gets pretty, pretty consistent, right?
[03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:35.000]  And so in my book, I went through what I call Hollywood Babylon and how Kubrick was aware of this relationship.
[03:54:35.000 --> 03:54:42.000]  And maybe early on he might have been coaxed into, you know, working with NASA to film 2001, which is on record.
[03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:45.000]  And then later on realizing that this is a bad deal.
[03:54:45.000 --> 03:54:52.000]  And so movies like Eyes Wide Shut expose how the system really works, how they use cults and mind control.
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:55:01.000]  And how in that film, if you remember the people in the cult, in the Eyes Wide Shut cult, it's like they recruited the best looking women in the world, right?
[03:55:01.000 --> 03:55:08.000]  It's all supermodels to entrap people as well as some of the wealthiest people out there, right?
[03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:10.000]  So now it's starting, wait a minute.
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:12.000]  So Balenciaga, Zoolander.
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  We just did a lot.
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:16.000]  We just did a big analysis of Zoolander on my channel.
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:17.000]  We got him a YouTube channel.
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:19.000]  You'll find that Balenciaga, Zoolander 1 and 2.
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  And although Zoolander is satire, I mean, that's the point of this movie, right?
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:28.000]  Was that the fashion world is actually run by the very thing that Eber Bernays talks about, this invisible government.
[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:35.000]  And the fashion world exists to kind of control and steer culture, just like Hollywood and all these other elements do.
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:37.000]  That's what Eber Bernays says.
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:41.000]  He says that Hollywood and the fashion industry create and control culture.
[03:55:41.000 --> 03:55:42.000]  It is mind control.
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:45.000]  The system itself is mind control.
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:52.000]  According to Bernays, the guy who basically organized the system, like no one else.
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:55.000]  And so Kubrick's films tell you this.
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:55:59.000]  They tell you that the elite are a bunch of degenerate pedos.
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:02.000]  That's the point of Eyes Wide Shut.
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:07.000]  If you didn't watch it and pay attention, that's the point of Barry Linden.
[03:56:07.000 --> 03:56:11.000]  That's the point of other Kubrick films, right?
[03:56:11.000 --> 03:56:14.000]  Lolita.
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:22.000]  So Kubrick, I think, was a conflicted character, in my view, who worked with the system to get, you know, access to things,
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  the special lenses that NASA had for filming things.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:27.000]  And then realized later on that this was a bad deal.
[03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:32.000]  And then, you know, I don't think that the establishment was very happy with movies like Eyes Wide Shut.
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  And then we look back and then see movies like that.
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:36.000]  And it tells us the whole system.
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:39.000]  It tells you Jeff Stein, McEffrey's whole operation, right?
[03:56:39.000 --> 03:56:45.000]  It's exactly what you see there, or these people at Balenciaga, these weird directors and NIGAR and all these people.
[03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:50.000]  I mean, that's exactly the model of what you see going on in Eyes Wide Shut.
[03:56:50.000 --> 03:56:52.000]  Kubrick was telling us this long ago.
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:57:01.000]  And then when we come to other directors like the usage of HD Wells in Spielberg and other directors who are pushing the alien mythology,
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:02.000]  that's all propaganda.
[03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:09.000]  C.D. Jackson, the guy who was in charge of the CIA's doctrinal warfare program to recruit the churches,
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:13.000]  he was the one that consulted on one of the first big alien movies.
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  The day the Earth stood still.
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:18.000]  So this is all propaganda.
[03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:20.000]  And it's openly propaganda.
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:25.000]  I'm not saying everybody's in on it in bad, because some people try to expose things and critique things,
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:27.000]  just like Kubrick did with Dr. Strangelove there.
[03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:33.000]  And sometimes it doesn't go well for the people that do that, right?
[03:57:33.000 --> 03:57:37.000]  So if you want to learn more about this, you can get my book at my website, JasonAlces.com.
[03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:41.000]  You get signed copies there, part one and part two of SSH Hollywood,

[03:57:47.000 --> 03:57:53.000]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow Info Warriors here in the United States and around the world.
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:58.000]  We are so excited to announce Info Wars MD.

[03:59:14.000 --> 03:59:19.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[03:59:19.000 --> 03:59:25.000]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[03:59:25.000 --> 03:59:30.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[03:59:30.000 --> 03:59:34.000]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[03:59:34.000 --> 03:59:40.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[03:59:40.000 --> 03:59:47.000]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
