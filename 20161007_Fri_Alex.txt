[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  That was a real one, Chubby.
[00:09.000 --> 00:12.000]  Thirty-one days, folks. Thirty-one days.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  This will be a day long remember.
[00:16.000 --> 00:39.000]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic, technocracy tank-over.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  You want it, baby. You're about to get it.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, October 7th, 2016.
[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  There is now only thirty-one days from the gigantic world-shaking election.
[01:04.000 --> 01:19.000]  And you can see NATO and the globalists trying to start wars with Russia, trying to back jihadi armies all over the world with our own military at almost a schizophrenic level, fighting with itself over America's heart and soul.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  We have foreign globalists like George Soros accelerating racial tensions in this nation.
[01:25.000 --> 01:32.000]  We have the hurricane not swimming into Florida quite as hard as they said it would.
[01:33.000 --> 01:42.000]  They said it would hit it as a category four. It's hit as a three only in a few areas, and thank God only a few people died and reported that from things like heart attacks and car wrecks.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  So no real fatalities yet. I'm sure there will be some. Unfortunately, there is a lot of panicking.
[01:47.000 --> 01:56.000]  We have videos of that. People ransacking in vicious supermarket brawls as Hurricane Matthew Panic hits.
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  We've got the CDC. This is a quote said police will eventually arrest the unvaccinated as, quote, diseased criminals.
[02:05.000 --> 02:15.000]  We've got Bill Clinton confronted again last night by a woman and then again last night again.
[02:16.000 --> 02:25.000]  Tim Kaine, the VP candidate, and the gentleman got it out on national ABC News when they were carrying it on mainline broadcast TV that actually still hits a big audience.
[02:25.000 --> 02:37.000]  People ask, why am I doing this? Because it can cause a cresting event, a chain reaction when the media is forced to talk about why is everybody saying Bill Clinton's settled sexual assault cases?
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  And Kathleen Willie said that she was raped by him and had a witness that came in minutes after when she was bloody.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  And it goes on and on and on. This is known about the Clintons. We're going to force this out in the open.
[02:49.000 --> 02:59.000]  So that's coming up. I'm not going to just sit here and play games. We put aircraft in the skies during the RNC.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Well, actually they had for the first time ever for a full week before they blocked aircraft after we announced it one day after.
[03:05.000 --> 03:13.000]  So we flew it three or four days before and then in outskirts during and it ended up being in thousands of newspapers, hundreds of TV channels, dozens of national channels carried it.
[03:13.000 --> 03:21.000]  And it became the meme at the RNC, lock her up, lock her up. Hillary for President, General Flynn was asked to be agreed with it.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  He said, absolutely, she's engaged in treason working with Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[03:26.000 --> 03:31.000]  That's where Trump gets that is from the former head of defense intelligence who was removed two years ago.
[03:32.000 --> 03:40.000]  They didn't claim he did anything wrong. He said, you're removed because he was not going along with the murder of now over 200,000 Christians, another 200,000 or so non-Christians.
[03:40.000 --> 03:47.000]  Most of those on the Syrian side with the Western back jihad invasion.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  So we're doing the same thing with rape and a lot of people go, man, you know, that's pretty dangerous. The Clintons kill people.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  I want to explain something to everybody. I know that.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  So I'm in the arena and quite frankly, I don't see anybody else in the arena at the level in full versus.
[04:04.000 --> 04:10.000]  But myself, my family, my crew, we're in the arena and we need Providence. We need your prayers.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  It's not that we believe in prayers. We depend on it. We know it. We don't believe it. We know it in ourselves.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  And this is history. Whatever is God's will is going to happen.
[04:20.000 --> 04:28.000]  I am not going to sit idly by. In fact, I pray every morning and every night intensely that God will give me the answers to wake up the people to defeat Hillary.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  Now, maybe God's plan Hillary gets in. I think Trump's going to win. They're going to steal the election.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  The evidence is mounting on that. We have news on that front today as well.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  But this is an incredible time to be alive.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  Massive World War III intensification news. In fact, it's in my office. I forgot to bring it over from the notes.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  It's on dues desk. I gave it to him last night.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  A stack of articles about the Russians launching a no fly zone. That's getting no attention here.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  Obama threatens a no fly zone.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  And the Russians just say, our no fly zone is up and we're going to shoot you down.
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  Coming to a city near you, ISIS serial killers. That's right.
[05:02.000 --> 05:08.000]  An ISIS magazine, Rumayah, is recruiting serial killers to carry out knife attacks in the West.
[05:09.000 --> 05:16.000]  This hate group or religion of peace, according to Hillary Clinton, explains to potential recruits how they don't need a gun to terrorize innocent people.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  They just need a knife.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  This same publication also calls for its servants to shed blood and even to die for their cause.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  How would you describe that?
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  Radical Islam? I'm sure Barack Obama will be ignoring this because radical Islam doesn't exist to him.
[05:31.000 --> 05:36.000]  I'm sure Hillary Clinton will turn a blind eye to this as well as she doesn't want to offend anyone on the eve of an election.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  Here's a crazy idea.
[05:39.000 --> 05:44.000]  Find out whoever is publishing this mass murderer producing hate rag and start questioning him and his entire staff.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  It's okay to assume it's a man as they're in charge of women in radical Islam.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  Then jail him or start getting some answers on ISIS leaders immediately.
[05:52.000 --> 06:15.000]  Or are we really that incompetent? This is Owen Schreuer from Infowars.com.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[06:26.000 --> 06:34.000]  Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades old scientific research to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpyJRX herbal processing technique.
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.

[07:23.000 --> 07:35.000]  With our exclusive, perfected process, Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[07:40.000 --> 07:41.000]  No needles, no injections.
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.000]  Don't take my word for it.
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.000]  Try it for yourself.
[07:45.000 --> 08:10.000]  It's Friday, October 7th, 2016. We are now only 31 days from the historic election.
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing for lies and disinformation.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  I'm your host. Thank you so much for joining us now.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  You got the nightly news tonight at 7 o'clock, Infowars.com forward slash show for details.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  This is the syndicated radio slash TV transmission in Full Wars Live, which is truly Alex Jones.
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.000]  And then I will return, as we always do, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m. ahead of the second historic debate.
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  And I don't want to say this is make it or break it.
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  For Trump, as Hillary so ill, they're throwing everything they've got at Trump, it's still not working.
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  He clearly is way ahead in most of the swing states.
[08:57.000 --> 09:08.000]  We've got big reports, though, of the feds moving into the swing states to protect the elections by hooking special, loving computers up to the machines.
[09:09.000 --> 09:10.000]  But oh, the feds aren't involved in elections.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  It's preposterous what Darkheart Alex Jones said.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  But now they've got to go federalize them immediately to save us from the Russian boogeyman.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  And so I will broadcast live, as we always do, 4 to 6 p.m.
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.000]  I'm going to walk out of the radio studio, the original studio in this building, starting back 10 years ago, we've been in this building.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  And then I will walk over here into the TV studio, the big studio.
[09:33.000 --> 09:43.000]  And I will host for two hours with a roundtable discussion with David Knight, Leigh Ann McAdoo, Darren McBrain, you name it, our investigative reporters taking your phone calls.
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  And then we will have the 90 minute debate that is going to be hosted by two Piranha-like enemies.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  And we've got a whole article up on infowars.com.
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  This is going to be an even more stage debate.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  And it goes over. Sunday's debate moderators will be even more biased than Lester Holt.
[09:59.000 --> 10:00.000]  Steve Watson does an excellent article.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.000]  Anderson Cooper and Martha Ratt are basically Clinton allies.
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.000]  Basically, they're deep state allies.
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  And then there's clip after clip in there of them demonizing and lying about Donald Trump.
[10:14.000 --> 10:21.000]  I mean, this is going to be three against one and Trump has to be controlled, but he has to come out and say in his opening statement.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  I just want to point out that did make commission admitted that the audience couldn't hear my mic last time and was being faded down.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  I just want to point out that I was interrupted 40 plus times Hillary six.
[10:32.000 --> 10:40.000]  And I want to point out that I'm here, even though this is stacked against me, just like everything's rigged like NAFTA and GATT against the American people.
[10:40.000 --> 10:47.000]  And I just want America to have a level playing field. And I'm asking Anderson Cooper and Mrs. Radd.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  Raddits, I am asking both of you.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  The public is watching.
[10:53.000 --> 10:59.000]  If you interrupt me 50 times and Hillary five times, I'm debating three people, not one.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  So please coming into this, don't put your finger on the scale.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.000]  And I don't say that because I'm a sore loser.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  Everyone knows what you did.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  Tim Kaine earlier last week.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  Interrupted 60 plus times.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  And so did the moderator.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  You people are incredible.
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.000]  So you're on notice.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  And then every time he starts erupting, he goes up, there you go again.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  And that's a tactic to point out they're cheating.
[11:28.000 --> 11:35.000]  They do this tactic deceptively when they go, we can't let one more child be killed by firearms, not one more.
[11:36.000 --> 11:37.000]  And they go, oh, another one.
[11:38.000 --> 11:39.000]  See, it's their fault.
[11:40.000 --> 11:41.000]  The second amendment.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  Remember, they've gone from denying they want to ban the guns to now all the big editorials and New York Times and Washington Post and Rolling Stone.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  It's time to repeal the second amendment.
[11:50.000 --> 11:51.000]  And they're like, yeah, it's your fault.
[11:52.000 --> 11:53.000]  You killed that kid.
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.000]  And the second amendment is that if you're going to be a car, is it my fault if I have a Ford truck and somebody else has a Ford truck and runs over somebody?
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  You know, that's happened before.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  Is it Ford's fault?
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  Is it the Ford war?
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  No, it's not.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  But see, that's a false tactic when they know out of 330 million Americans, even though overall gun crime has been gone down for 18 years, it's gone back up a little bit, but still way below what it was in 1992.
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  It was down 60%.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  Now it's down about 52%.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  And I've had top statisticians on the federal government even admits that.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  But the point I'm getting at is the tactic.
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  It's like Chinese water torture because you go.
[12:25.000 --> 12:26.000]  Now you did interrupt last time.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  They've been rigging these to make commission a minute.
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  I was right.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  And the commission's watching this time that appealed to authority, which is true.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  The commission admits I'm right.
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  So I would look, look, interrupt me 20 times in her 10.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  I mean, you can have double just not just not five times or six times.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  Okay.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  I would add some smart ass stuff in there like that.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  And I'd say, I know you're on a power trip, Anderson.
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.000]  I mean, I would just go right at it to say these are biased people.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  They've both attacked me.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  It's on record, but I'm still here.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  I'm still here walking into this rigged event.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  But I want their gloves checked because they're putting, you know, shoe horses or shoe horses.
[13:08.000 --> 13:09.000]  They're putting horseshoes in them.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.000]  That's the old joke of, you know, a rig fight.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  There's like big blocks of metal inside of those when you hit your opponent.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  It's actually brass knuckles.
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  So that's what I would do.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  We can also open the phones up today and get your take on what you think Trump needs to do.
[13:23.000 --> 13:32.000]  But I know he got told by his daughter is very smart and very nice through intermediaries,
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  through Chelsea Clinton, that if you'll just be nice, mom will be nice.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  And that's why Hillary got so happy when he said secretary.
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  He's an artist.
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  And when he smiled at her, Hillary did that little fake smile back that almost looked convincing.
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  The most human I've seen her look in years.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  And it was because she knew Trump had taken the bait.
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  She knew he'd taken the bait and that people have weaknesses for their daughters.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  And by the way, Trump's daughter is incredibly smart.
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  But I knew this day after it happened.
[14:02.000 --> 14:10.000]  And then later I even saw it leaked in the news that his daughter Ivanka had been advising him and that others had been as well.
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  And that basically Roger Ailes just walked off weeks before saying, you know, he won't do what I tell him, which is fine.
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  Uncoachable, but he has his own style.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  Trump has to be Trump.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  And when she does stuff like you're so mean to women go, really?
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  20 years ago, a contestant that, you know, gained a bunch of weight and wouldn't do the job.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.000]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  If a boxer, you know, goes above weight, they format the fight.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  Your husband has settled sexual assault cases.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  You fund jihadist worldwide that sexually mutilate women.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  You got a lot of nerve, lady, and you're the one that punched below the belt.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  You're the one that brought up family and women.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  You want me to bring up Bill?
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  And she'll shut her mouth right away.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  This is really important.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  This is the first news story I'm going to get to.
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  But I really love news stories that are informative, that are happening, but are also illustrative.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  There have been six in the last seven days.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  It'll be seven days tomorrow, six and a half days.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  So there have been six events and they're accelerating the first event happened.
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.000]  And then three days later, the rest of the events happened a few times to a day where Bill Clinton, Tim Cain, Hillary Clinton,
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  and that's why one reason she's canceling her events for two weeks, but also she needs to nap,
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  is that they do not want Hillary with somebody screaming, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  Basically every event, because I'm told there's been other ones that we haven't seen the video yet.
[15:36.000 --> 15:44.000]  Every time somebody basically goes out to give a speech, valiant Americans, valiant Americans who I salute,
[15:44.000 --> 15:51.000]  in the crowd, legally and lawfully with their free speech, point out that Bill Clinton has a history of sexual impropriety.
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  Now, of course, we launched that call.
[15:58.000 --> 16:04.000]  It said $5,000 if you get the audio out and the video on national TV, just to make it a little more fun.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  But you got to do it in legal and lawful areas.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  And today we're getting the checks right at the end of the show.
[16:10.000 --> 16:11.000]  I'm going to sign these on here.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  These are going to be mailed out of next week.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  We're getting a bunch of these folks on the broadcast.
[16:16.000 --> 16:23.000]  We ought to line a bunch of them up for the two-hour or four-hour pre-gain coverage that we're going to have Sunday here
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.000]  at infowars.com.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  And stations across the country and many stations I know already pick up the Sunday show.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  You're just welcome to pick up all or none.
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  It's basically commercial free.
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  There's a few breaks an hour, but you can just run ads over it whenever you want.
[16:37.000 --> 16:46.000]  As everybody knows, in radio and TV and media, we're the easiest people to work with.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  We're not territorial.
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.000]  We're not penny pinchers.
[16:51.000 --> 16:52.000]  We're not retentive.
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  When it comes to obsessing, we just want to fight the new world order.
[16:57.000 --> 17:03.000]  So, why is this so illustrative of a cascade event?
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  If you get people out there and they start confronting the Clintons,
[17:08.000 --> 17:14.000]  it's going to force the media to finally bring up rape, which I've been told by not just Roger Stone,
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  but I've been told by two different Fox hosts, several other Fox executives,
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.000]  that I actually met with at the Ritz Carlton at the RNC there in Cleveland, Ohio,
[17:26.000 --> 17:27.000]  and then others as well.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  And I wasn't at liberty to talk about this until the last few days.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  I saw Roger talked about it, so now I can.
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  I can talk about his case.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  He had been a consultant for Fox for many years,
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  and it was basically on retainer to go on there whenever they wanted him on.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  And then about six, eight months ago, one week after CNN said he was banned,
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  and MSNBC said he was, quote, banned from the air, something that they never do.
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  And we'll have people on attacking him, but he can't respond.
[17:53.000 --> 17:59.000]  Unpresidented, unjournalistic, unethical behavior, he was basically told,
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  you don't bring up Bill Clinton settling sexual assault cases,
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  or we need a Roderick or Roderick or any other stuff.
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  You don't bring it up.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  And still he wasn't allowed on air.
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  So he's been banned all over TV.
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  Now they still talk about him constantly and take clips out of context,
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.000]  but that's why we're sending people to break this electronic Berlin wall.
[18:21.000 --> 18:25.000]  That's why we're doing this, because there are women trying to get their voices out
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  for a long time that the TV won't have on, who've been silenced,
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  women who settled cases, who we've had on the broadcast,
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  that Clinton has settled cases with.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  And I've interviewed people that had their arms and legs broken
[18:40.000 --> 18:41.000]  just because they knew about Clinton and Jennifer Flowers.
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  I mean, they don't play games.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  So I'm going to skip this network break here so we have time to play these clips
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  and this latest clip out of Nevada.
[18:52.000 --> 19:00.000]  But it's key to understand that we're doing this because even the WikiLeaks
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  and the DCLeaks have come out in the last few months and confirmed
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  what we already knew.
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  Busloads of moveon.org, that's Soros and Hillary,
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  telling people we're settling with Sanders, put on these t-shirts
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  and then go out and physically attack people at Trump rallies.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  So the mainstream media could say Trump was doing it in a racist
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  and show him attacking Sanders people and Sanders people attacking
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  and starting it so Hillary could be clean on the outside of it.
[19:27.000 --> 19:30.000]  That was clear Matthew of Ellion, simple level divide and conquer.
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  That's checker level move, okay?
[19:33.000 --> 19:34.000]  Very amateur, the public can't even see it or understand it.
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  Now we have the actual email.
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  So you want to send people to rallies, dressed up like KKK,
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  saying they're Nazis, saying they love Trump,
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  to then have fights with the minorities that they go and pick up
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  from the homeless areas and others and put in Bernie Sanders outfits
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  and then give them a bunch of liquor and then get them drunk to come have a fight
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  and you want to scream racist and then say he's Hitler.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  Well, we're going to expose the fact you've settled sexual assault cases
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  and fly around on the Lolita Express, an aircraft of a convicted pedophile
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.000]  who had a pedophile island off the coast of Florida.
[20:11.000 --> 20:16.000]  I mean, look at Penn State, look at the Catholic Church,
[20:17.000 --> 20:18.000]  look at every major institution.
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  Big Protestant institutions get caught being run by pedophile rings.
[20:23.000 --> 20:24.000]  That's where these people go.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  It's a very small minority of people that prey on boys and girls.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  But nevertheless, it's there.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  Bill Clinton took twice as many flights on pedophile island,
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  billionaires, Lolita Express than previously reported.
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  Look it up yourself.
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire pedophile.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  Okay, this is what came out.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  He settled some of the cases for underage,
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  but he was reportedly had literal sex slaves.
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  And then of course you've got her living with,
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.000]  staying in the same hotel rooms with Uma Abidine,
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  whose mother is into mutilating women sexually.
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.000]  And the number one proponent, promoter, pusher,
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  that's admitted in these legal filings
[21:07.000 --> 21:12.000]  and these Islamic journals to cut women's genitals off
[21:13.000 --> 21:14.000]  because it's so glorious.
[21:15.000 --> 21:16.000]  I didn't realize how ignorant people are.
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.000]  Every time I mention this, I see comments on YouTube saying,
[21:19.000 --> 21:20.000]  how do you cut a woman's genitals off?
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.000]  Women have genitals, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  Okay, if you don't know what the Muslims are doing,
[21:26.000 --> 21:27.000]  don't sit there and say I'm a liar
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  because you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[21:30.000 --> 21:31.000]  And I'm not talking to our general audience.
[21:32.000 --> 21:33.000]  I just get amazed, like I said yesterday,
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  that members of Congress think that islands are floating.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  They're not.
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  They're underwater mountains that stick up,
[21:43.000 --> 21:44.000]  usually volcanic, like Hawaii.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  And then the smarter people in Congress say,
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  well let's just cruise missile the Russian air bases in Syria
[21:51.000 --> 21:52.000]  and then we won't have any loss in life.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  And the generals say back to them,
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  but that will cause a war because they'll strike back.
[21:59.000 --> 22:00.000]  And our own Congress goes, I don't understand.
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.000]  What do you mean?
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.000]  We were using pilotless missiles.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  See, it's a new level of idiocy that we're dealing with here.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  And people just want to imagine their winners
[22:14.000 --> 22:15.000]  and imagine there for women
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  and imagine there for the good guys
[22:18.000 --> 22:19.000]  and imagine everything's okay.
[22:19.000 --> 22:26.000]  We've got Hillary over here with this serial abuser of women
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.000]  who is the one that shuts them down,
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  who is the one that shuts them up.
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.000]  In fact, here's the article right here.
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.000]  We'll show folks.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[22:37.000 --> 22:38.000]  Trump's supporter crashes Tim K. Rowley.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.000]  We've got all this happening.
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  We've got all this going on.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  And they think that their constituents are so stupid
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  that they're not going to figure it out or understand it.
[22:50.000 --> 22:51.000]  And you know what?
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.000]  Maybe her constituents are so evil,
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  they don't care if women are getting raped and abused.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  They don't care if Hillary's back in jihadist.
[22:58.000 --> 22:59.000]  But I believe a lot of them will care,
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  so we're working as hard as we can to get this out.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  Now, I knew what I was getting into
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  when I announced this last Friday.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  Spontaneously, I said,
[23:09.000 --> 23:10.000]  we need to have a contest for people
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  to get the Bill Clinton rape shirt on TV at these crowds
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.000]  where they have these public video shoots,
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.000]  totally legal and lawful,
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  just don't climb onto the stage.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.000]  That way you don't get charged
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.000]  with trespassing or stuff like that.
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.000]  But regardless, at serious times,
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  I need desperate measures.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  But we don't want them spinning it
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.000]  like we're violent or we're bad.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  That's Black Lives Matter
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  and people that take over the stages
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.000]  and beat people up and say they're going to rob
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  the hurricane victims and all the rest of it.
[23:39.000 --> 23:40.000]  That's coming up.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  We need to be impeccable and almost everybody has been.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  I'm told he's been charged, we've got him a lawyer
[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  and we're going to get to that at another point.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  I think he ought to just come on air
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  and be the hero he is
[23:51.000 --> 23:52.000]  and New York will drop the charges
[23:53.000 --> 23:54.000]  because their security people assaulted him,
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.000]  first grabbed him before he tried to climb over.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  Then he just held on when they were grabbing him
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  and we have gotten him a lawyer.
[24:01.000 --> 24:02.000]  It's actually a lawyer, people know his name
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  but we're not going to talk about it at this point.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  But that's why I say do not climb over the metal.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  He is going to get the 5,000
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  because he's the first, even though he didn't do it right.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  He had guts, he did it first.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  He's the Paul Revere, he's the Lexington,
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.000]  he's the Concord in the Info War.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  He was the detonator.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  Because I can have ideas all day
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  and I can go out and do it myself.
[24:25.000 --> 24:26.000]  I've been arrested breaking into live
[24:27.000 --> 24:28.000]  Fox Broadcast myself in New York with a bullhorn.
[24:29.000 --> 24:30.000]  Took it over for 15 minutes.
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  They went ahead and arrested me.
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.000]  They couldn't stop me see out there in the street.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  I told folks get bullhorns in there
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  but look, a lot of these rallies I understand you can't
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  but here's why I'm doing this.
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  I have to.
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  I love my children, I love this country, I love this world.
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.000]  Somebody's got to stand up to the Clintons.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Somebody's got to have the will to say no to them.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  Somebody has got to call their bluff
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  and I know full well that the Clintons
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  and their history of rape and all the things they do
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  and how dangerous they are
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.000]  and famously Ron Brown, the Commerce Secretary
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  they were going to bring him down
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  and blame him for the Clintons corruption.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  I'll talk to Congress, he said it publicly.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  He was dead two days later
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  and the Army Coroner that did the autopsy
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  said he was shot in the head with a.45 caliber handgun.
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.000]  Look it up.
[25:15.000 --> 25:16.000]  So I know what they do.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.000]  Here's the difference.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  Hillary's launching the attacks.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  Hillary's trying to shut down the Trump rallies.
[25:23.000 --> 25:24.000]  They're trying to shut down our free speech.
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  They're coming after our guns.
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.000]  They've dissolved our borders.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.000]  She's funding radical jihadists.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  She's bringing in economic tyranny.
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.000]  They want us under their control.
[25:35.000 --> 25:36.000]  They want us under their control.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  These people think they can do whatever they want to us
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.000]  whenever they want
[25:43.000 --> 25:44.000]  and they can't
[25:45.000 --> 25:46.000]  and so everybody thinks you're successful
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  by going along with the system.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.000]  No you're not.
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.000]  At a certain point you've got to start saying no
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  and that system is run by dangerous psychopaths
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  that are trying to start World War III right now.
[25:57.000 --> 25:58.000]  We've got big reports on that,
[25:59.000 --> 26:00.000]  the latest developments on that front
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  so over the top it is mind boggling.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  I'm going to start getting to some of that
[26:04.000 --> 26:05.000]  right after this break.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  You can pull it up in the Moscow Times,
[26:08.000 --> 26:09.000]  pull it up in Daily Caller,
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  you name it, I did a report on it last night
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.000]  and I'm going to give you the headline right now.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  Russia launches no fly zone.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  The West says we're going to come in
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  and have a no fly zone over Syria
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  when that's a sovereign country,
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  you're not invited in.
[26:26.000 --> 26:27.000]  Another double cross to back up ISIS and Al Qaeda
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  because they're getting their butts kicked.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  Russia says okay boom, our shields up.
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  Don't come in.
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  That's how fast militarily things escalate.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  That's how dangerous these situations are
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  and cooler heads have to prevail
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  and we can't have old drugged out,
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  mentally ill, dangerous globalists
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  running our country and running our world.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  We've got good people in the government,
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.000]  good people in the military,
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  good people in the private sector,
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  good people in the media,
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  demonized or shoved aside,
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  who just need other people to stand up
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  and hit the barbed wire forum
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  to have the courage to get these issues out there first
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.000]  so we can bring these tyrants down.
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.000]  That's why they're so scared of these type of events
[27:07.000 --> 27:08.000]  but in a message to Hillary Clinton,
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  dealing with this article,
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  Bill Clinton's a rapist,
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  Trump supporter crashes Tim Kaine rally
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  and then we're going to play that clip
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  of what happened last night.
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  Hillary, you're on us,
[27:21.000 --> 27:22.000]  you've got us in a stranglehold,
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  you're dismantling our country,
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  the bitter clingers, you're out to get us,
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  you admit that.
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  In your public statements, your private statements,
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  you say you're coming after the alt-right media
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  and we have no right to exist.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  You're telling us we have no right to exist,
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  we take you at your word,
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.000]  we know how evil you are
[27:40.000 --> 27:41.000]  and so you have to understand,
[27:42.000 --> 27:43.000]  we thought we could fix things
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  without really taking the gloves off
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  and if you think we've taken the gloves off now,
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  I mean, I'm here standing against you,
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  I know you represent people that have overturned countries
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  and killed hundreds of thousands of people
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  and then you go on TV and brag about you Kaine,
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  you saw he died, you're Brian Williams,
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  you lie about being in combat,
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  you're a horrible, demonic, evil person
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  but I'm more scared of your agenda succeeding
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  than I am of you cooking up charges,
[28:09.000 --> 28:10.000]  having me killed, sending one of your loons
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  then to come after us
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  and folks have to understand
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  that's how dire these traits are.
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  So I want to salute the people
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  that are peacefully going out and exposing the rape.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  I think you can expose,
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.000]  you ordered to stand down at Benghazi,
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  she ordered to stand down at Benghazi,
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  I don't have the money to offer prizes for that
[28:30.000 --> 28:31.000]  but those are things that are important as well.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  You can also expose the fact that,
[28:34.000 --> 28:35.000]  Hillary Clinton completely collapsed,
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  she didn't stumble.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  Infowars.com, whatever,
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  but quite frankly,
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.000]  I like it when you say info wars.com
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  because we're going to fight this thing,
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  we're going to go all the way
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  but when you're sitting there watching ABC News
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  and CBS and all these
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  and it's info wars.com, Bill Clinton's a rapist,
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  you know, it's my duty to do this
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  just like it's the people doing its duty
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  and I salute them, but let me tell you,
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  it's next level, there isn't a level above this folks
[29:03.000 --> 29:04.000]  when you're engaging these evil people
[29:05.000 --> 29:06.000]  that are so horrible, so psychopathic
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  at point blank range
[29:09.000 --> 29:10.000]  and you're hurting them
[29:11.000 --> 29:12.000]  and you've got them in a corner
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  against them.
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.000]  I mean, we're at the forefront of exposing
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  her epilepsy and the Secret Service League,
[29:18.000 --> 29:19.000]  we're at the forefront of fighting globalism,
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  we're at the forefront of exposing the election fraud,
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  we're at the forefront of their plan to get the guns,
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  we're at the forefront of that,
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.000]  we broke that they dissolved the government
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  three years ago, the borders.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  We forced that out.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  I mean, info wars is the flaming,
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  white hot tip of the spear, folks.
[29:37.000 --> 29:38.000]  Just understand, we are the Alamo,
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  this is the defense.
[29:40.000 --> 29:41.000]  See, we're not engaged in an assault, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  We're in a defensive offense operation.
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  Coming to a city near you, ISIS serial killers.
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  That's right, an ISIS magazine,
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  Rumaia, is recruiting serial killers
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  to carry out knife attacks in the west.
[29:56.000 --> 29:57.000]  This hate group, or the ISIS group,
[29:58.000 --> 29:59.000]  is a group of people who have been
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.000]  attacked by ISIS,
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  they've been killed by ISIS,
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.000]  they've been killed by ISIS,
[30:06.000 --> 30:07.000]  they've been killed by ISIS,
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  they've been involved in espionage attacks
[30:10.000 --> 30:11.000]  about knife attacks in the west.
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  This hate group, or religion of peace
[30:14.000 --> 30:15.000]  according to Hilary Clinton,
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.000]  explains to potential recruits
[30:18.000 --> 30:19.000]  how they don't need a gun to terrorize
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.000]  innocent people, they just need a knife.
[30:22.000 --> 30:23.000]  This same publication also calls for
[30:24.000 --> 30:25.000]  its servants to shed blood
[30:26.000 --> 30:27.000]  and even to die for their cause.
[30:28.000 --> 30:29.000]  How would you describe that, radical Islam?
[30:30.000 --> 30:31.000]  I'm sure Barack Obama will be ignoring this
[30:32.000 --> 30:33.000]  because radical Islam doesn't exist to him.
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.000]  I'm sure Hilary Clinton will turn
[30:35.000 --> 30:40.160]  offend anyone on the eve of an election. Here's a crazy idea. Find out whoever is publishing
[30:40.160 --> 30:45.040]  this mass murderer producing hate rag and start questioning him and his entire staff.
[30:45.040 --> 30:49.000]  It's okay to assume it's a man as they're in charge of women in radical Islam. Then
[30:49.000 --> 30:54.200]  jail him or start getting some answers on ISIS leaders immediately. Or are we really
[30:54.200 --> 30:58.080]  that incompetent? This is Owen Schreuer from Infowars.com.
[30:58.080 --> 31:03.200]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[31:03.200 --> 31:07.720]  called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[31:07.720 --> 31:12.680]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started
[31:12.680 --> 31:17.600]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into
[31:17.600 --> 31:22.760]  the water. They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima
[31:22.760 --> 31:27.400]  crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare
[31:27.400 --> 31:33.440]  yourself and your family. Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning
[31:33.440 --> 31:38.400]  the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be
[31:38.400 --> 31:43.740]  the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[31:43.740 --> 31:48.000]  This is the real deal, folks. And the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[31:48.000 --> 31:54.360]  any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at InfowarsLife.com or by

[33:00.040 --> 33:04.000]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jonesified this election cycle. It's a guy
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.520]  named Alex Jones. Alex Jones. From Infowars. From Infowars. From Infowars. Yeah. Alex Jones.
[33:08.520 --> 33:13.760]  Alex Jones. One of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11. I heard
[33:13.760 --> 33:19.560]  that on Alex Jones, so it's true. Claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were
[33:19.560 --> 33:25.600]  inside jobs. The conspiracy du jour, Hillary Clinton is harboring a secret medical condition.
[33:25.600 --> 33:30.800]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex? I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's
[33:30.800 --> 33:33.080]  Jones. Google is being accused of hiding negative
[33:33.080 --> 33:38.000]  stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to various stories
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.840]  like the Clinton's body count stories. That's according to website Infowars. And this really
[33:42.840 --> 33:46.320]  just is so disgusting. The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex
[33:46.320 --> 33:53.680]  Jones. It goes right to Alex Jones, and it shows up in Donald Trump's mouth. Hillary
[33:53.680 --> 33:59.000]  Clinton created ISIS with Obama. The very fringe of the conspiracy movement, like Alex
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.560]  Jones, are being kind of incorporated into the campaign. If Trump gets elected, he's
[34:03.560 --> 34:07.800]  going to be Secretary of Defense. I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic. Move, bitch!
[34:07.800 --> 34:14.440]  Get out of the way! Bill Clinton is a rapist at Infowars.com. Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[34:14.440 --> 34:19.760]  Bill Clinton is a rapist. Infowars.com. Infowars.com. Bill Clinton is a rapist. The New World Order
[34:19.760 --> 34:29.360]  sends its regards. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's
[34:29.360 --> 34:36.240]  Alex Jones. So I want to just make a point. This studio
[34:36.240 --> 34:39.680]  is probably 65 degrees. I've been on there 21 years. I'm in some of the best shape of
[34:39.680 --> 34:43.880]  my life. When I start talking about nuclear war with Russia, or Hillary Clinton coming
[34:43.880 --> 34:48.160]  after her enemies because I can, at a gut level, know this is not safe what I'm doing,
[34:48.160 --> 34:56.080]  but it's my responsibility, I start sweating. Not even out of fear, it is a biological response
[34:56.080 --> 35:00.640]  when I realize what we're engaged in is 21st century warfare. And the enemy, the White
[35:00.640 --> 35:06.680]  House, the globalist, Soros, they're all tuned in daily with their different establishment
[35:06.680 --> 35:12.520]  sites chronicling everything we say and launching talking points against us because they're
[35:12.520 --> 35:17.800]  scared of death of what we represent. And they cannot stand that the military listens
[35:17.800 --> 35:24.040]  to us, the police are listening to us. Most of the people in the government are now listening.
[35:24.040 --> 35:30.480]  They know how accurate we are because no one's ever covered the angles of this like we have.
[35:30.480 --> 35:35.400]  And so they hear us and know we're telling the truth because they know we understand
[35:35.400 --> 35:38.840]  the secret stuff that's going on, not just the public. And they say, how do you know
[35:38.840 --> 35:43.800]  that? We've reverse engineered the whole thing. And you've got pieces we don't have,
[35:43.800 --> 35:48.280]  we've got pieces you don't have, but together we now know there's a force in America that
[35:48.280 --> 35:55.040]  wants to destroy the Republic. And so when I see someone new jump up on ABC News and
[35:55.040 --> 36:02.640]  confront Kane, who is a horrible person. I don't cheer, oh, Info Wars is on national
[36:02.640 --> 36:07.360]  ABC News, man, we're really making it. I don't cheer, oh my gosh, this is great, I'm famous,
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.520]  it hits me in my gut. And I actually have to stand there at the counter this morning
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.920]  and just go, because I know it's going to get big, no matter what happens to me now,
[36:16.920 --> 36:21.320]  it's going to be more and more, it's a cascading event, not just for the prize money. People
[36:21.320 --> 36:24.120]  start having three, four times a day, they're probably going to start shutting down their
[36:24.120 --> 36:28.480]  public events. As people realize the power of this, it's going to start happening to
[36:28.480 --> 36:33.400]  local corrupt government people. And we're going to put them into a fortress mentality,
[36:33.400 --> 36:39.160]  not from physical violence, but from Info War. And see, they know that, they overthrow
[36:39.160 --> 36:44.080]  countries with stuff like this. They go and get groups to go do this in Ukraine and do
[36:44.080 --> 36:48.440]  this in Egypt and do this in Syria, but to call for violence and uprisings. We're just
[36:48.440 --> 36:54.040]  exposing your crimes and letting the people at home watch, no, you're not alone. Take
[36:54.040 --> 36:59.160]  action, get out of your coma. Let me tell you something, I see those men and women,
[36:59.160 --> 37:02.800]  I like how the one guy did it because they come over to him, they talked to him outside
[37:02.800 --> 37:06.600]  the Trump rally. He gets the information out about their covering up the sexual assaults
[37:06.600 --> 37:11.480]  in full wars.com. That's great because it doesn't put him in danger. It's slick. It
[37:11.480 --> 37:15.800]  gets out there, but it's even more dramatic to see a man, a bear of a man being wrestled
[37:15.800 --> 37:23.920]  down, grabbed for simply saying, Bill Clinton's a rapist with the shirt on. And I see them
[37:23.920 --> 37:29.160]  there with their courage and not caring, knowing they're standing against evil. And it just
[37:29.160 --> 37:33.920]  humbles my heart to be associated with people like that. And then I said it before I go
[37:33.920 --> 37:38.840]  on air and I said to myself, how do I come up with words to describe how serious this
[37:38.840 --> 37:47.940]  situation is? I mean, listen, the elites that run this country have firepower 10,000 times
[37:47.940 --> 37:52.760]  what Adolf Hitler did. They overthrow countries, they kill whoever they want, when they get
[37:52.760 --> 37:56.600]  all the suits and the bureaucracies and the UN to green light it. It's hard for them though
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.000]  to kill individuals in this country because that's the type of thing that brings them
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.920]  down, especially someone that's never been in one of their agencies, never been with
[38:03.920 --> 38:08.560]  one of their big companies or worked for them. I've never taken their money. I've never worked
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.640]  with them. I've never been in their system. There's weird rules to this, even though the
[38:12.640 --> 38:17.600]  Clintons break a lot of them, that I've never been in one of their groups. If I'd ever been
[38:17.600 --> 38:21.680]  in the CIA or ever, which is like being, you know, saying you work for Walmart, it's no
[38:21.680 --> 38:27.640]  big deal. It's everywhere. I'd be dead. They just see it as your own and it's in the contracts
[38:27.640 --> 38:32.520]  and it's been done forever. It's grandfathered in. They kill a lot of people when they hit
[38:32.520 --> 38:42.320]  55, 60, 70 years old already. And I've talked to people that are in 50 year Delta 4th contracts
[38:42.320 --> 38:48.080]  that are like 65, 70 years old, a lot of them in Texas. I mean, I haven't talked to a lot
[38:48.080 --> 38:52.520]  of them in Texas. There's a lot of them in Texas. And it's just known that you hit 65,
[38:52.520 --> 38:58.160]  70 and you just get a real fast act and flew and you're dead. That's just how it works.
[38:58.160 --> 39:01.920]  You know, sometimes they drop by and just kill, you know, half a neighborhood of the
[39:01.920 --> 39:05.400]  Patriots. You just got to get rid of those guys. You can't leave them, leave them there
[39:05.400 --> 39:11.080]  because they know everything. And this is just part of the job. Well, I'm an organic
[39:11.080 --> 39:17.800]  response to this takeover of America. I, I'm not a loser. They think I'm a loser because
[39:17.800 --> 39:20.480]  I didn't sell out to them. They think I'm an idiot. They think I'm a chump and I don't
[39:20.480 --> 39:25.400]  want to make this about myself. You understand the journey we're all on together. I was taking
[39:25.400 --> 39:29.800]  clips off C-span of the Chinese Communist Generals meeting that was coming out in the
[39:29.800 --> 39:34.200]  impeachment hearings. But I was having David Shipper's on and the impeachment lawyer and
[39:34.200 --> 39:37.880]  I was, he was exposing Kenneth Starr for being a Chinese operative, which has all come out
[39:37.880 --> 39:42.800]  now. And I didn't know why I had cars following me and guys threatening me in parking lots
[39:42.800 --> 39:46.200]  that were military and playing clothes and asking if I was planning to blow something
[39:46.200 --> 39:49.800]  up. And then this high level Democrat off record called me, one of the biggest ones
[39:49.800 --> 39:53.200]  in Austin and said, listen, we're going to give you a big radio show. Come work with
[39:53.200 --> 39:57.520]  us. Everything's handled. I want to see you when you go on your show tonight. Say good
[39:57.520 --> 40:01.600]  things about Bill Clinton. And he called me up on my home phone number and he said, you
[40:01.600 --> 40:06.360]  son of a, we're going to get you now. He was just so hate. You just don't know what you've
[40:06.360 --> 40:09.920]  done. And you know, a year later, you know, they had me physically attacked. They had
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.480]  me fired off the radio. They, they, they, I've already experienced these people when
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.240]  I was one one hundredth of my influence. So they need to get it through their heads and
[40:21.240 --> 40:27.080]  everybody else does that. I know the cost are so great that this is why I'm doing this.
[40:27.080 --> 40:30.920]  And the people knew it's, it's beyond what I'm even telling you here on air, not to
[40:30.920 --> 40:36.880]  make you think I'm some hero. It's not that folks, you know, I hate to use a cheesy analogy,
[40:36.880 --> 40:40.400]  but it's like Star Trek, Rathacon, this whole ship should get blown up if spot doesn't go
[40:40.400 --> 40:45.000]  in and fix the reactor. And my analogy to you is one person can't fix the reactor.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.320]  It may take tens of thousands of us getting imprisoned or killed by these people. And
[40:49.320 --> 40:53.280]  then folks say, well, we'll just go offensive. What against local cops, the local FBI don't
[40:53.280 --> 40:59.280]  even know what's going on. Or it's more allied with us than, than with the globalist. We're
[40:59.280 --> 41:04.440]  not just going to keep this thing of war with the UN. I'll shoot blue helmets. No, no, no.
[41:04.440 --> 41:09.360]  It's not going to work like that. It's going to be civil unrest. It's going to be race war.
[41:09.360 --> 41:14.800]  We need to stop all that. And we need to understand that if we go to a physical war, it's because
[41:14.800 --> 41:19.800]  we failed in the info war or we're going to affect the battle space to such a great extent
[41:19.800 --> 41:24.000]  that when it goes physical, these people in the power structure have no idea. And believe
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.760]  me, they're arrogant, but they really ought to ask themselves, since when does the secret
[41:27.760 --> 41:35.680]  service go out and give the media information about a nominee? They don't do that. We've
[41:35.680 --> 41:46.280]  had three secret service agents on this show. We've had, and then they're not our sources.
[41:46.280 --> 41:50.240]  They've had their houses broken into their kids threatened over coming on. I mean, folks,
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.200]  you need to know this isn't a game. People like Bongino, he's a manly man, you know,
[41:54.200 --> 41:56.480]  former New York cop. Well, he was, well, I got, you know, I'll take care of it. So I
[41:56.480 --> 42:01.680]  don't want to talk about it. Yeah, it's going on, but whatever. But stop telling them on
[42:01.680 --> 42:09.760]  their own resources. I'm not. You just got to turn loose, Bongino. And he's got to turn
[42:09.760 --> 42:13.680]  loose to this life because you're going to lose it anyways. And I'm not saying that I'm
[42:13.680 --> 42:19.560]  telling him how to be a tough guy. The threat of these evil people is so great. We don't
[42:19.560 --> 42:24.000]  have a choice. You think I want to do this? There's a lot of fishing, a lot of hunting,
[42:24.000 --> 42:29.960]  a lot of hiking I want to do. I want to be able to take care of my family. And I struggle
[42:29.960 --> 42:39.080]  with guilt constantly that I should be not a sellout, but just not be the first guy hitting
[42:39.080 --> 42:44.400]  the beach every time because I need to take care of my family and my children. But you
[42:44.400 --> 42:50.680]  know something? That's how you lose civilizations. You got to be all in because when you're all
[42:50.680 --> 42:55.560]  in is when God gives you the Providence. And that's when we stop World War three. That's
[42:55.560 --> 43:00.000]  when we stop the child kidnapping rings and the Lolita Express and all these big evil
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.680]  demons that think we're weak. You look at bookletting, stomping around like a, like a,
[43:03.680 --> 43:11.040]  like a God of a nightmare. Yeah, yeah, I do what I want. Oh yeah. Yeah. And I see you
[43:11.040 --> 43:17.320]  and I'm just here to say my will, my soul, my blood, my treasure, my family, it's all
[43:17.320 --> 43:23.800]  in all in. You feel that total commitment? That's called total commitment bill being
[43:23.800 --> 43:33.720]  the opposite of a selfish pig like you. Here's the problem. They're totally committed to
[43:33.720 --> 43:39.720]  evil. They're delusional and we are on the verge. I told you folks, they threatened to
[43:39.720 --> 43:44.000]  no fly zone and shoot down Russian aircraft that the Russians were going to turn on their
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.480]  missile defense system and then turn on their countermeasures if there is a strike with missiles
[43:48.480 --> 43:53.800]  that go a thousand kilometers, 2000 kilometers. They've got ones that go even 3000 kilometers.
[43:53.800 --> 43:57.640]  They can fire from Russia proper at our targets and you're like, we'll blow them up. We got
[43:57.640 --> 44:02.480]  even better stuff. That's the whole point. World War three starts. I mean, there is such
[44:02.480 --> 44:06.000]  a hubris in Washington, such an insane arrogance. It's not in the military. It's not in the
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.960]  Pentagon where they keep going. We got a missile superiority three to one. We got like, yeah,
[44:11.960 --> 44:18.000]  but it doesn't matter. North Korea's got four or five nuclear weapons and we don't want
[44:18.000 --> 44:21.760]  to invade them because they'll blow Seoul off the face of the earth and they'll blow
[44:21.760 --> 44:28.360]  Tokyo off the face of the earth as well. We got satellites and particle beams and we already
[44:28.360 --> 44:32.440]  shoot down their missiles when we test them. Yeah, I know. The point is, you can't shoot
[44:32.440 --> 44:37.880]  them all down, especially if there's thousands of them, not three of them. Yes, we can deal
[44:37.880 --> 44:44.120]  with North Korea, not with Russia, not with China. I'll tell you the crazy irony of this.
[44:44.120 --> 44:48.560]  If you look at the big crappy, you know, mansions Hillary has, there's reports of their all
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.280]  rotting and, you know, it's all just fetid and they've got all these houses and just
[44:52.280 --> 44:58.200]  all this crap and no one around them loves them. They're all empty. That's in the news.
[44:58.200 --> 45:02.640]  For what? So you get 50 million more from the Chinese to buy another crappy mansion.
[45:02.640 --> 45:10.480]  And now China has the entire ICBM system that Russia wouldn't give them. And then now we
[45:10.480 --> 45:15.520]  are in a face down with Russia. You people are crazy. You're crazy. I'll tell you who's
[45:15.520 --> 45:19.640]  crazier. Those of us that sit here and let these crazy people run the show. So let me
[45:19.640 --> 45:25.560]  explain something. I don't arrogantly launch operations that are successful against the
[45:25.560 --> 45:28.680]  new world order because I want to be the tip of the spear. I do it because I've got to
[45:28.680 --> 45:32.920]  do it because other people either don't have the audience to launch things like this or
[45:32.920 --> 45:39.080]  they don't have the will or whatever it is. We're here. We're going to do it. We're committed.
[45:39.080 --> 45:46.320]  And I've got more ideas as well. And I want to tell the viewers and listen to something.
[45:46.320 --> 45:52.120]  I commend you. I am humbled by what you've done. Don't ever call in and thank me because
[45:52.120 --> 45:56.160]  you are the people on the ground that are doing it. And I've done it. I've been where
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.120]  you've been many times and I know what it takes when you're in a crowd of 200, 300 evil
[46:01.120 --> 46:06.680]  moronic cult members. And what it's like when they attack you or beat you up or drag you
[46:06.680 --> 46:11.760]  out or whatever it is, all of you are heroes and you have amazing courage and you are the
[46:11.760 --> 46:16.680]  stuff that will turn this thing around. And that's the good news here is I'm only supposed
[46:16.680 --> 46:19.680]  to be an example. And Lord knows I'm not perfect. And other people are just supposed to be an
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.200]  example to others that if the globalist takeover is the most important thing I've said. If
[46:24.200 --> 46:31.760]  they shut down the web, shut down freedom, start the persecution, that's out of weakness.
[46:31.760 --> 46:46.360]  It's poster hangs. It's pirate radio. It's going to public rallies. It's speaking out.
[46:46.360 --> 46:54.960]  It's scaling billboards at night. In the info war, one billboard in a town will be the talk
[46:54.960 --> 46:59.120]  of the city if they actually shut the press down. See, as things get darker and there's
[46:59.120 --> 47:10.440]  less light, smaller lights are bigger. And they're going to push the wrong people. And
[47:10.440 --> 47:14.440]  it's going to be very organic. What you see if the enemy is stupid enough, because here's
[47:14.440 --> 47:18.880]  the deal. They've had a 3040 point year plan, at least in this current permutation, they're
[47:18.880 --> 47:24.600]  going ahead with a plan that counts on maybe 1% being awake. We got like 10%. And it's
[47:24.600 --> 47:28.800]  exponentially growing. That's critical mass. They kind of get that now so they're accelerating
[47:28.800 --> 47:34.480]  their operation against us. It's too late. They need to run up the white flag. And I
[47:34.480 --> 47:38.240]  wouldn't call, I'll tell you, if Hillary and Soros and the globalists would just leave,
[47:38.240 --> 47:41.680]  take their hundreds of millions, go somewhere, quite frankly, I'm all in to despair the blood
[47:41.680 --> 47:48.200]  of the innocents, to have an armistice like Napoleon or whatever, and just go, just go.
[47:48.200 --> 47:56.600]  Just go. Go to South America. Just get out of here. Believe me, I'm all about Daytona.
[47:56.600 --> 48:02.240]  I'm all about, I don't have some vindictive thing where I want to burn you or where I
[48:02.240 --> 48:07.360]  want to physically mount your head on a wall, you know, metaphysically, so that I feel like,
[48:07.360 --> 48:14.960]  oh, oh boy, I'm big. I'm part of the power structure. I don't want the dirty power.
[48:14.960 --> 48:19.080]  I want you to get off the little people and to stop lying to the poor minorities that you
[48:19.080 --> 48:24.440]  want to help them when your whole cosmology is about keeping them poor. I've got all the
[48:24.440 --> 48:30.360]  letters, they're public of LBJ with a great society. I tell you what, I see rich black
[48:30.360 --> 48:36.400]  people around, get them back on the plantation, get the men out of the house, get the women
[48:36.400 --> 48:42.040]  running things, and I'll have those inwards voting Democrats for 100 years. That was his
[48:42.040 --> 48:46.600]  response to Republicans, get the Civil Rights Act passed. That's why he told the South,
[48:46.600 --> 48:51.160]  he said, you're going to pass this stuff. We're going to be their best buddy now. They
[48:51.160 --> 48:56.040]  all got their little clan meetings and said, what do you mean, boss? Listen, dumbass, how
[48:56.040 --> 49:00.520]  do you control somebody you got domesticated? You got to feed them before you slaughter them,
[49:00.520 --> 49:03.840]  the little piggy going to trust you when you load them up to take them to the butcher.
[49:03.840 --> 49:07.520]  Oh, that's how we're going to do it, boss. That's how we're going to do it. Now sit down
[49:07.520 --> 49:14.080]  and do what I say and quit wearing them stupid clans robe in public. We don't do that now.
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.960]  We care about the black people now. Senator Byrd, our commander, what do we do? Absolutely,
[49:18.960 --> 49:23.080]  we'll do that right away for you. I mean, that's what's going on. I just sit here and
[49:23.080 --> 49:30.160]  I watch these people and it's just like, pull my hair up. And then they just wind up these
[49:30.160 --> 49:37.480]  hordes of horrible, racist, crazed black people. I mean, you think a big gaggle of racist clan
[49:37.480 --> 49:43.640]  people is disgusting? Their numbers are small, huge groups of just sullen, spoiled, racist
[49:43.640 --> 49:50.360]  black people bitching everywhere. I mean, it's just unbelievable run by some weird joker
[49:50.360 --> 49:56.360]  lady. I just can't handle it, man. I just I'm not going to sit here and put up with
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.720]  it. Somebody has got to stand up against this. I, I just spiritually can't go along with
[50:00.720 --> 50:05.240]  this. I mean, that's it. I can't help myself. My flesh says, man, you really ought to back
[50:05.240 --> 50:12.160]  off. You are really asking for it. I'm not stupid. But then I say I got to and there's
[50:12.160 --> 50:16.160]  not talking about my personal journey. Is it's a journey I know you've been through or
[50:16.160 --> 50:18.600]  a journey you're going to go through? Because let me tell you something. They're getting
[50:18.600 --> 50:22.320]  ready to implode. Deutsche Bank like we told you six months ago, it's already happening.
[50:22.320 --> 50:25.640]  They're getting ready to start a bunch of wars. They're going to bring in a global depression.
[50:25.640 --> 50:28.840]  There's no way they can sustain this forever. And I don't like this fiat system, but I hope
[50:28.840 --> 50:31.200]  they sustain it for a lot longer. I'm going to skip this network break because they're
[50:31.200 --> 50:37.320]  going to be a show soon. Who knows? Yeah. But, but, but let's show people are doing on the
[50:37.320 --> 50:44.360]  front lines right now because it's cutting out the, the, the rhetoric and Oh, calculate
[50:44.360 --> 50:50.840]  be like this and then you'll win over Democrats. I'm not trying to win over Republicans or
[50:50.840 --> 50:56.200]  Democrats. I'm not trying to play in their little sandbox paradigm. I want to not overthrow
[50:56.200 --> 51:01.920]  it, but expand it. I want people to understand that there's a real world and a Renaissance
[51:01.920 --> 51:08.920]  system versus a conquest system. And then we're going on to a conquest system when the Renaissance
[51:08.920 --> 51:15.480]  system, we've always been a mix is what made us so great. So I truly am here to not play
[51:15.480 --> 51:19.640]  their game, but to change the nomenclature, to change the terms, to change the paradigm.
[51:19.640 --> 51:26.560]  And guess what? Info wars, I can unequivocally tell you with language and the terms used
[51:26.560 --> 51:33.180]  is the most effective outlet in the last 50 years in the Liberty movement against the
[51:33.180 --> 51:38.320]  globalist project. We are, because the time we came along, all the rest of it, numero uno.
[51:38.320 --> 51:42.040]  Drudge is much bigger and wonderful and great. It covers a wide spectrum and it's helping
[51:42.040 --> 51:45.840]  inform the masses and, and, and it's wonderful. But when it comes to having people imitate
[51:45.840 --> 51:51.160]  us and, and, and have people repeat what we say and go research it, we've shifted paradigms.
[51:51.160 --> 51:55.880]  You the listeners are just as important as I am or just as important as somebody at World
[51:55.880 --> 52:03.120]  Net Daily or, or, or, or Matt Drudge. And he will tell you that. Matt Drudge came out
[52:03.120 --> 52:06.800]  speaking to Matt Drudge yesterday, just a paradigm shift and said, is this hurricane
[52:06.800 --> 52:10.960]  maybe not as strong as they're saying? And this is for political purposes to pass the
[52:10.960 --> 52:14.640]  global carbon treaty, which they admit they now passed, but Congress hasn't ratified, but
[52:14.640 --> 52:19.320]  they're saying we're still under. Of course that's it. And then they, they kind of said,
[52:19.320 --> 52:23.520]  well, it really wasn't category four, it's category three. Okay. I've got, without even
[52:23.520 --> 52:27.640]  looking dozens and dozens of articles attacking him that he's discredited because he said
[52:27.640 --> 52:31.160]  this wasn't as strong as they said it would be. They were using it for political purposes.
[52:31.160 --> 52:41.280]  They're all over the news. Hillary Clinton, ABC news, NBC news, all of them saying that
[52:41.280 --> 52:45.360]  we need to pass carbon taxes and Bill Clinton's initiative or, or, or it is Bill Clinton's
[52:45.360 --> 52:50.400]  initiative, Barack Obama's initiative or Hillary's initiative or all dead. So see, that's how
[52:50.400 --> 52:54.200]  they spend being right. They were just talking about eight million, you know, out of their
[52:54.200 --> 52:58.160]  houses, thousands dead. No, luckily it's a lot lower. It's really bad and Haiti though.
[52:58.160 --> 53:04.000]  It's a 300 to something now. Last time I took 200 yesterday, we knew Haiti be bad, but the
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.680]  issue is clearly they're politicizing it. And then we're not supposed to say, oh, look,
[53:07.680 --> 53:13.360]  you're politicizing. We should call them on everything they do. It's all free number to
[53:13.360 --> 53:21.760]  join us. Talk about what should Obama do to try to get his agenda through in the last
[53:21.760 --> 53:28.640]  month. I mean, what do you think they're going to be pulling in the last 31 days? So the
[53:28.640 --> 53:34.560]  election happens and he's a total lame duck. What is Obama going to do once he's a lame
[53:34.560 --> 53:38.800]  duck and is in there and has two months left until January 18th or whatever it is? What
[53:38.800 --> 53:43.000]  is inauguration this year? I think it's the 18th. What is Hillary going to do in the
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.320]  last 31 days? What dirty tricks and October surprises that they have? What do you make
[53:47.320 --> 53:51.880]  of the debate? What should Trump do? What should Trump say? I think you should come
[53:51.880 --> 53:56.360]  out of the gates and say, this is a three against one. Just like the last debate, they
[53:56.360 --> 54:00.200]  did turn my mic down. They did turn it off. You better only interrupt me as much as you
[54:00.200 --> 54:06.320]  interrupt her. Stop giving her extra time. Stop responding. That's what needs to happen.
[54:06.320 --> 54:09.720]  People want the rigging to be called out just like he did with election fraud. And I got
[54:09.720 --> 54:18.680]  a bunch of news on that front. 800-259-9231. 800-259-9231. Briefly, and then I'm going
[54:18.680 --> 54:23.880]  to go to these clips of valiant folks out there confronting Bill Clinton on his sexual
[54:23.880 --> 54:29.960]  assault past. Before we do that, we have a bunch of specials running right now. We have
[54:29.960 --> 54:39.360]  23% off our flagship product. That's DNA force with the BioPQQ, the CoQ10, and so much more.
[54:39.360 --> 54:43.280]  It's the BioPQQ has 175 clinical studies, and it's got all the other key enzymes and
[54:43.280 --> 54:47.920]  things to help boost it and get full absorption. The patented ingredient in the DNA force contains
[54:47.920 --> 54:53.800]  more potent antioxidant activity than the vitamin C. CoQ10, digestive enzymes, and so
[54:53.800 --> 54:59.000]  much more. It is a smorgasbord of the very best. It is our flagship product, and your
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.760]  purchase helps find the operation. By the way, I haven't even been plugging this. I've only
[55:01.760 --> 55:12.880]  been plugging the extra strength biome defense product at m4slife.com, our new seven years
[55:12.880 --> 55:19.480]  in development probiotic. But we also, again, have one that is basically half the price,
[55:19.480 --> 55:27.280]  25 million live, but 23 probiotic strains. We've got that for $39.95, and then we've
[55:27.280 --> 55:35.160]  got biome defense for $69.95. And similar formulas are, again, over $100 at Whole Foods,
[55:35.160 --> 55:38.880]  ladies and gentlemen, that we believe aren't even as good. We send you with a cold pack.
[55:38.880 --> 55:45.280]  This is the Rolls Royce. I could have easily private labeled hundreds of other probiotics,
[55:45.280 --> 55:50.440]  but I didn't because they just aren't cutting it. This is amazing, and it's so important
[55:50.440 --> 55:57.800]  to give it to yourself, your family, you name it. It's filled with 60 capsules in both the
[55:57.800 --> 56:04.520]  half price version and the full price version that's twice as strong. m4warslife.com or
[56:04.520 --> 56:10.320]  call toll-free, 888-253-3139. And whether it's a Hillary for prison shirt that's about to
[56:10.320 --> 56:14.040]  be history, we're not going to make no more of those with a new limited edition, lock
[56:14.040 --> 56:19.560]  her up, Gadsden flag version, and m4store.com. That is what funds this operation. That is
[56:19.560 --> 56:32.760]  what makes all of this possible at m4warslife.com or m4store.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[56:32.760 --> 56:39.120]  And that's how we can pay out $100,000 in our national initiative to expose the sex
[56:39.120 --> 56:42.520]  crimes of Bill Clinton and the coverup by Hillary Clinton. That's really what it is.
[56:42.520 --> 56:45.720]  You can call it a bounty at first. That's not the right term. It's just for peacefully
[56:45.720 --> 56:49.000]  getting the word out. Let's play the latest gentleman who needs to send us his info and
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.760]  proof, you know, obviously a photo of himself and who he is. So we can have him on the show.
[56:52.760 --> 56:58.080]  We'd like to certainly send him to $5,000. We'll mail it today. Stop Rape at m4wars.com.
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.120]  So Bill Clinton is a rapist. Trump supporter crashes Tim Cain around me. And this is in
[57:02.120 --> 57:05.160]  Nevada last night. We'll show you the ABC news version. Then we'll show you the version
[57:05.160 --> 57:21.280]  shot by I believe it's his wife who's there with him. Here it is.
[57:21.280 --> 57:48.800]  All right. I love how Bill Clinton the day before says, Oh, she doesn't want to stay
[57:48.800 --> 57:53.920]  in talks. He can't debate as they drag the lady out. Same thing with this guy. But here's
[57:53.920 --> 57:57.920]  what I want to say. This is history happening right now. And I smile to see the courage.
[57:57.920 --> 58:02.720]  I admire what you're doing. I've done similar things. And I know what it's like to be in
[58:02.720 --> 58:07.920]  that position. But this is history. This is history happening. And they're not laughing
[58:07.920 --> 58:11.400]  now, just like with Brexit, they're not going to be laughing. Or we're going to force them
[58:11.400 --> 58:15.960]  to try to steal the election. And then that will even discredit them further. We cannot
[58:15.960 --> 58:25.640]  lose if we engage the globalist. Laying down is how we fail. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[58:25.640 --> 58:33.840]  It's Friday, October 7th, 2016, only 31 days from the historic election. You're listening

[59:47.520 --> 01:00:16.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:23.860]  liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:49.440]  All right. He already played this at the end of the last hour. I want to play now from
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.740]  the other angle, but I want to show you that first. Got on ABC News and other platforms
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:59.740]  from behind, and this was shot by a lady who's there, maybe his wife. It looks like she's
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:05.340]  with him. And you hear Tim Cain saying, you know that Pence is getting ready to basically
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.780]  drop out. I mean, he's already getting ready just to run in four years for office again.
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:16.380]  Just totally making that up. This is what they do. They lie. They deceive. They sent
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:22.060]  bus loads by the thousands. I mean, it would be 20, 30, 40, 50 buses per event for Trump
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:27.740]  all over the nation of people to go riot and attack and then blame it on Trump. But notice,
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:31.940]  I know when something's really devastating, no mainstream media will pick up the fact
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.460]  there's a national move to expose rape because that's the talking point that you get fired
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:42.100]  if you bring it up. It's come on the news, not just Roger Stone, but others start bringing
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:48.900]  it up. They cut the feeds. They cut Donald Trump's feeds. The only place it got out was
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:54.460]  on Sean Hannity. They're scared of this. That's why we're targeting it. Because their whole
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:58.380]  thing is about how horrible Trump is to women when it's the opposite. So here's the other
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:59.380]  angle.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:28.940]  So if you add that to a bunch of things, Donald Trump-
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:32.420]  All right, this goes on for a while. There's also the front of the speech where Cain's
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:41.500]  making ridiculous lies up about Governor Pence. But again, they send people to scream, Donald
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:48.500]  Trump's Hitler, Donald Trump hates women, Donald Trump's a racist. Well, Bill Clinton
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:55.140]  settled sexual assault events with women. And other women have said he raped them. I've
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:59.380]  interviewed three of them that were on record to be working in and around Bill Clinton.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:05.220]  I mean, this guy is a known predator. He flies around the Lolita Express. They've now got
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:09.700]  child actors out there in fake press conferences and fake town halls with Hillary. We covered
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:14.380]  that yesterday. I mean, these people, this guy's the limit. So I'm showing folks how
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:18.540]  you take action. And our listeners are doing it. But whatever happens to me, and I'm sure
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:22.220]  we got Providence, your prayers, we're out in the sunshine, Jim Garrison over 300 people
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:25.900]  got killed on the JFK investigation. They said, why are you still alive? You know, being
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:31.020]  the prosecutor here in New Orleans. And he said, I stay in the sunshine. And you see
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:37.580]  the stuff happens to him in that movie. I've experienced the exact same stuff. And again,
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.500]  I'm not up here saying, oh, I'm this hero. I'm explaining to folks, these people are
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.940]  monsters. And most people like David Brock or others that, you know, are fighting the
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:52.300]  Clintons. Even Chris Ruddy for bizarre, he gives them foundation money, a million dollars
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:56.100]  plus, and now won't let the sex stuff come up on Newsmax. I'm not attacking Newsmax.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:00.120]  They do a lot of great work. It's just that's all coming out that everybody is basically
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.620]  bowing and going along with the Clintons. Let me tell you is it Matt Rudge, WorldNet
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:12.580]  Daily. So DrudgeReport.com, WorldNetDailyInfoWars.com, Daily Caller and Breitbart. And I'm so glad
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.620]  to see all these other sites that are firing up and doing good journalism and getting crews
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:22.300]  and doing things like right side and others, because we need everybody to get more aggressive.
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.700]  Everybody to get more radical. That's what protects us. We're under radical globalist
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.140]  attack. You don't just not want to sound radical. So you just kind of let them take
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.820]  over. That's their tactic to be so radical. You can't even say what they're doing is
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:37.700]  it sounds crazy. No, you just call it what it is. You expose them, you get aggressive,
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:43.820]  legal and lawfully. And who blanks first loses and you just push it. And I love the fact
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:48.180]  that MSNBC admits this is what they hate, that I have helped, you have helped this audience,
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:53.740]  you, you get the main credit, my crew, at radicalizing the public, because the public
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:58.900]  is totally docile being raped. They need to get radical and stand up.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:04.020]  Drug Raid. 81 year old Margaret Holcomb was minding her own business in her humble home
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:08.900]  with her son when all of the sudden she was part of a full blown drug raid. This wasn't
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:14.500]  a wrongful raid on an incorrect address as we've seen in the past. No, no, they caught
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:20.260]  a fish with this one, literally one fish. After all, Margaret had one marijuana plant
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:27.540]  growing in her backyard garden. Get the choppers, get the National Guard, take this woman down.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:31.140]  The joint raid between the National Guard and the Massachusetts State Police, which
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:37.860]  also included a military helicopter, was successful and they were able to take down the one marijuana
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:44.060]  plant. A job well done, boys. Now, Margaret will have to find a nice legal pharmaceutical
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:48.940]  to ease her arthritis and glaucoma. Now, does the war on drugs make sense to you? This is

[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:11.620]  It's Friday, October 7th, 2016. We are now only 31 days from the historic election. This
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:24.300]  is the Alex Jones show. I have the checks here, $20,000 worth of them and I'll be signing
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:29.260]  at the end of the broadcast today for the patriots that went in and got attacked and
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:33.380]  got clawed and got, you know, you name it in some of the cases. In many cases, not for
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:37.020]  bringing up the fact that Bill Clinton has settled rape cases and that the media has
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:43.020]  an embargo on anyone talking about his sexual past. While they claim Trump is hurting women
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:49.380]  and mean to women and bullying women and Hillary's caught with child actors in fake town halls,
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:53.460]  how the child actor little girl is sad because everyone's mean to her at school over her
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:58.620]  body size. She's not an ugly girl, not fat either. It's all made up because of Donald
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:05.500]  Trump. They're framing him for hurting women while they have a media control rigged embargo
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:09.700]  and you bet, we took the gloves off, we're saying, get in there, expose the right, expose
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:14.900]  the history. And by the time I pay out $100,000, this thing's going to be cascading. We got
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:19.020]  31 days left of the election. So since I mentioned it, I want to go to some phone calls right
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:22.940]  now and tell you what's coming up. But since I mentioned it, let's go ahead and play the
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:28.340]  ABC News version because they also have their own cell phone version of a gentleman who
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:33.980]  was in Nevada last night with a couple hundred Democrats there here in Canespeak because Hillary
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:37.700]  can't go out on the road. She's having so many convulsions. I think people have a lot
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.540]  of courage. And again, you send a bunch of black lives matter and Soros people in to
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:46.100]  cause fights and attack people. We're just peacefully exposing what you've done. We're
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:50.300]  not calling for violence like you do or beating people up. We're just saying Bill Clinton
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:55.260]  as a history of sexual assault info wars.com. And here's the clip.
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:06.340]  We're now in the word out of Trump Tower in New York is the Donald Trump was not too
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:25.700]  happy. I got to go back instead, right? Hillary, you know, she can't talk to herself. Hillary,
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:35.060]  trying to cover up Bill Clinton's rape. He really wants to shut that down. ABC News just
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:43.020]  keeps keeps rolling with it. And now the memos are going to have to go out. Cut the feed
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:49.420]  when the rape stuff comes up. So that's what I'm doing. It's not an October surprise. I'm
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:53.740]  just not going to sit here and watch that last debate last week. How dare you be so mean
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:58.660]  to women. You once said a woman broke her contract. She gained weight in Miss Universe.
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:03.500]  You're so hateful. And this was woman literally was the bimbo eruption person that went after
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:08.500]  the women threatened them that have PIs go to their houses, kill their animals, kill their
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:14.220]  family members. I mean, it's just incredible death. I'm sitting here with that whole nest
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:19.340]  of David Brock people at their media matters, Soros funded, you know, typing all this up.
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:23.780]  But notice they never go here. They never talk about this because it's a no, no. Where's
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:32.780]  the national news on the despicable Alex Jones? I knew when I did this, it would take 20 3040
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:35.940]  people doing this for it to even get the news. And I'm not trying to get in the news so
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:41.740]  info wars gets talked about. I'm trying to get the news of the rape gets talked about.
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:46.740]  I wish somebody else had done stuff like this. So I wouldn't have to sit here and stick my
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.780]  finger in Hillary's eye over and over again, but she's on top of me. She's on top of my
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:56.020]  family. She's on top of you. I can't help it. Bunch of bullies are sitting on me punching
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:12:03.940]  me in the nose. I'm going to get them off me or I'm going to die trying. So what does
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:06.820]  prompt me to do it? The debate I used to come out and say, this whole thing's been rigged.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:11.540]  You did cut my mic off. The debate commission admitted it. I got interrupted 40 something
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:17.980]  times last time. Don't interrupt me more than you interrupt her. I understood Cooper and
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:27.980]  rat lady. I mean, this would be like having Anderson Cooper be the moderators, like having
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:34.660]  miss you, Maddow, an admitted total enemy of Trump caught making all this stuff up. This
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:42.500]  is a joke. This isn't balance. This isn't fair. This isn't real questions. Since when
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.380]  do you have fact checkers live? They can't even trust a candidate to say what they want
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.820]  because we finally got a candidate who isn't controlled. And that's why they hating their
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:56.460]  internal memos. They're internal emails. They are panicking. Now what's coming up?
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:03.860]  We have a Paul Joseph Watson report that deals with the head of Citibank and Elon Musk and
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.460]  all these other big billionaires that have been in the news the last year. This first
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:12.620]  came out like five years ago. It was a headline. Top scientist at MIT have found an alternate
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:18.980]  universe overlaid over ours and ours appears to be artificial. And then they went on from
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:24.900]  there. I know I said reprint those. I don't see them in the stack. Where are those articles?
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.940]  I'm sure they're here. I just need those. If I don't have them yet, I'm just a bunch
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:32.300]  of them because what will happen is I'll come out and cover this and the New York Times
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:39.620]  or the Washington Post or, you know, come out and deceive people and they'll say Alex
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:44.100]  Jones claims the world is a simulation and it's a video game is totally insane. Knowing
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:48.700]  most of their viewers and readers don't actually go out and hear what the elite are saying.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:58.100]  The elite have always believed this. This is beyond Gnostic. And the truth is this is
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:04.020]  not a simulation. They're trying to convince you that you're already in the matrix so they
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:09.340]  can trick you into going into their new virtual realities. So the same trick that a lot of
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:12.660]  the Hindus and people have been put into about this world doesn't matter. You'll just be
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:17.380]  reincarnated. You know, it's, you know, life's all a dream. The Indians have super high IQs.
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:26.380]  You go there. It's a living hell because they just can't seem to get out of Nirvana. There
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:30.380]  it is. Bank of America analysts think there's a 50% chance we live in the matrix. It's just
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:33.740]  just print me a whole bunch of them because later, say about 40 after I'm going to play
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:38.180]  Paul Watson's report and then I'm going to give you the real scoop, folks. But they've
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:43.460]  always planned this and they admit they want to make things so ugly, so bad, 200 foot coffin
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:50.500]  apartments, everything ugly, broken up relationships, asexual systems that you will accept the
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:15:00.260]  matrix. That's been declassified of an American Federation of scientists. It was declassified
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:07.740]  in 1999 and then the Pentagon asked for it to be reclassified. And they said, we're going
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:12.220]  to make things so horrible that then you're going to be put into a tank at birth that you
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:18.220]  grow in that's a simulated reality and then your heat will fund the hive and then we'll
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.860]  all live in pods in heaven with the master computer programming us. It's like 10 steps
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:28.460]  worse than the UN pushed independent grassroots zeitgeist movement. Oh, a big computer will
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.900]  tell us what to do. We'll all live in big sports stadiums and be reeducated if we're
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:37.740]  not good. I mean, these are quotes. So now they've gone from we might be a month ago
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:43.740]  to we are, we are, and we're going to lead you out of Plato's cave. So I'm going to give
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:48.420]  you some of the big secrets here today that the big boys don't want you to know. And believe
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:53.660]  me, when I give you this info, this is what this is. This is this is big enchiladas. Like
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:16:03.220]  I said, there's going to be election fraud. This is what Trump needs to do. And they're
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:06.340]  going to blow up and they're going to run in there because they're already in there.
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:09.660]  And then the president comes out and says, it's crazy. There's no such thing. We don't
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:14.860]  run it. Federalizes it three weeks later was already federalized. We're just forcing them.
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:19.420]  That's like tinker toy stuff. Okay, compared to what's really going on. The problem is
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:23.500]  we've got to stay focused on the temporal and the basic stuff in front of us because
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:28.260]  that's how we get the public out of the matrix. You know, you say this isn't the matrix. The
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:33.860]  globalists are creating a false paradigm, sucking us into our TV screens, our smartphones,
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:43.980]  our virtual reality headsets to get us out of the third dimension that is the launch
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:51.300]  base to the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and beyond infinity and beyond. It's actually
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:57.700]  a very astute statement. People say it sounds like an oxymoron. It's not infinity and beyond
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:02.740]  unlimited infinities. And see all these atheists and all these globalists that tell you, oh,
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:05.980]  there's no God. We're just animals. No free will. Oh, it's all boring. No big deal. You
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.700]  just have this planet in space. But don't worry about that. You're not. There's nothing
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:13.660]  going on. Don't listen to just what all the ancients do. And now they're going, oh, there
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:17.220]  is actually some creature runs everything. It's got a computer. Oh, we have computers
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:22.340]  too. We're God. We're God. There's something did all this. It's all fake. We'll help you
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:28.980]  get out with what we built. That's a good one. So I'm going to go to your phone call
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:34.660]  first though, Anna Marie, James, Stephen, Chris, Tim and others. Then drones the circle
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:40.740]  Cowboys Stadium during game to understand what's going on each seat. CBS, DFW. I thought
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:46.100]  when I told you 15 years ago about the drone program and how they'd happen for law enforcement
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.820]  and how they watch all of us, how they watch farmers and use environmental laws, I was
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:56.220]  a big cookie, but that was declassified. Now it's all being announced as usual. But I'm
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:02.580]  more cookie because I was right. Remember? Remember just five years ago, we wrote about
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:06.740]  it and Drudge posted our article and there was a big issue of over 1000 newspapers. Drudge
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:11.940]  posted the insane rantings of Alex Jones that they're watching farmers and ranchers
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:16.340]  with drones and we're going to have them watching cities and permanently tethered blumps and
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:20.180]  blah, blah, blah. It was already in place. Then it all comes out and they go, so what
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:27.500]  cooks? Of course, it's good for you and Obamacare is free. So let's go ahead and go to Ann Marie
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:35.060]  and Pennsylvania. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Hi, Alex. Hi. Mr. Trump has to
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:41.460]  be that brazen unapologetic man we all fell in love with. I agree. I agree. That's what
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:45.700]  the people want. They want a restoration. They want a revolution. They don't want more milk
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:49.460]  toast. They don't want the pundits to pat them on the head. Trump, you'll just win if you
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:55.460]  become a wimp. No, they wanted to come in there and clean the floor with that witch.
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:59.060]  And in the debate, he should address his issues. We already know that they're not going to
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:03.660]  ask him anything that might help. Yeah, ignore their BS exactly and just move forward with
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:09.060]  information. I was, I was crying watching that man who, who, who wasn't young, by the
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:13.860]  way, he wasn't a young man at that cane rally. Be brave and, and do what he did. I was actually
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:19.060]  sitting here crying. I thought, you know, I, I wish that we would all do that. We should
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:22.700]  all do that. I can interrupt this. Skip this break too. This is too epic. 31 days after
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:26.220]  the election. Ma'am, what you're saying? Stay there. I'm going to, I'm going to come back
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:31.940]  to you and we just kept the break out of Marine in PA battle, key battle around state. Exactly.
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:35.020]  I got tears in my eyes this morning when I saw it, but I had to steady myself there
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.580]  on the counter after my kids had gone to school because I realized the evil we're facing and
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.580]  that the fact that this has to be done and the fact that they're grabbing on him, they're,
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:44.260]  they're pinching his arms. They're doing, you know, they're basically assaulting him.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:49.460]  You look at the video closely and he's just standing there and not moving and, and just
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:54.420]  shouting out the truth. And he looks like he's in heaven because it's good to break
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:59.540]  through the comfort zone and to be done. And, and they count on patriots being good people,
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:04.900]  quote, close quote and submitting. And the time for submission is over. Go ahead, Anne
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:10.620]  and I was, I'm not patting you on the back because I know you don't like that, but I,
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:14.660]  I think it was awesome that using Trump's name in the video to expose Hillary using
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:17.820]  that little girl to get people to look. That was genius.
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:21.260]  Well, sure. Some people say, what is this quick make deception? It says Donald Trump
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:25.380]  caught using child actors in fake town hall. Then everybody tunes in on the left besides
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:29.500]  how dare him. And then they're forced to go, Oh my God, it's Hillary and, and try to have
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:34.300]  some soul and think about how fake all this is. Absolutely. Look, I'm going full information
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:38.100]  warfare right now. The gloves are off. I told everybody the gloves are off right now. Get
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:44.500]  ready for more and I went out of two AM and I put a Trump stickers within a two mile radius
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:53.140]  of my house. It was great. Yeah, well, I don't recommend anybody do this because you can have
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:57.540]  a lot of adrenaline and break your leg doing it. But in times of, you know, total tyranny,
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:02.940]  it's criminal. In my mind, I'm not saying do this. If you don't climb a big billboard
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.020]  and spray paint, Bill Clinton's a rapist today before he comes to town. I mean, we're in
[01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:09.540]  a war. And by the way, I would do it. I'm not saying do it. I'm just in my own mind.
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:13.660]  I would do it to say a government PR billboard about vaccines or something where you paid
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:18.060]  for it. It's your billboard. They use your money to put that BS out or, you know, whatever
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:22.060]  crap they're pushing anti, find an anti gun billboard, whatever. And then boom, Bill
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:26.500]  Clinton's a rapist or whatever. Then it'll be all over the news. We're in a war. We need
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:32.740]  everybody needs to take the gloves off and put brass knuckles on, baby doing it, Alex.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:34.460]  Thank you so much. Have a wonderful day.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:37.620]  Ma'am, what was it like though? Because you sounded giddy there. I know the feeling. What
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:43.580]  was it like, you know, at 5am, you know, out there under the stars doing the Lord's work?
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:49.300]  It was great. It was 2am and everything was dewy. So I had to actually dry off things
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:52.420]  like, you know, different things so I could get this thing.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:55.060]  You were like a little, you were like a little sprite out there.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:57.420]  Yeah, I was like Santa's helper.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:04.300]  Good, Annemarie. Listen, I've been interrupting. Anything else you want to add?
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:09.140]  I just want, I hope God blesses you and your family and God is by your side, Alex. Never
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:11.140]  forget that. Never forget that.
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:15.900]  I know. I just already had the Clintons. I mean, I know what they're capable of. I mean,
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:19.620]  I got fired. They said, you know, wow, you're really big. We heard from the Democrats. You
[01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:24.100]  better shut up. And then I was told they tried to buy me off and I experienced what a mafia
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:28.220]  they are. And I'll say this with the Republicans. They're bad. They do terrible stuff. You know,
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:32.540]  the neocons that work with the Clintons, the Bushes, you know, vacation with them. But
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:36.540]  they didn't do that. If there was some stuff, but nothing like the Clintons, they are vindictive.
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:40.260]  And that's why most generals like General Flynn say they've had psychologicals done
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:45.980]  on Hillary and they've got a file on her. And she is super dangerous and vindictive.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:49.860]  I mean, obviously Hillary shouldn't strike out at her enemies. In a certain point, it
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:53.180]  makes everybody turn against her. But you know what? Somebody's got to do it. God bless
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:23:03.300]  you. Amazing call. Amazing lady. Yeah, it's a war, folks. It's a war. And by the way,
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:11.020]  every order at infowarstore.com gets several Hillary for prison 2016 bumper stickers. We
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:14.700]  can't put a bunch in because it'll make the weight go up. And then you have to charge
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:17.940]  you more for shipping. But we did order a million of these. I really should talk more
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:21.620]  about that. And you got to order them now this week, bringing them in 10 packs, 100
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:26.740]  packs, you name it, to put in legal and lawful areas. Hillary for prison info wars.com.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:30.860]  So they see Hillary for prison 2016 and they learn, you know, where they can go to find
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:36.340]  the resistance. And believe me, we are occupied by globalists. Their own emails admit this
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:42.380]  is a corporate takeover of America. I am under international law. I am under Geneva Convention.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:46.660]  I am the equivalent of a German citizen in 1944 is trying to save my country or a French
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:52.580]  citizen in 1942 or whatever. I am occupied. They admit it. It is fraudulent. They are
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:57.500]  above the law. They are criminal. They have taken the funding away from our veterans for
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:02.420]  their political views for social engineering. They have them on don't treat list. They are
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:06.100]  opening our borders. They are depleting our resources. They let people in with tuberculosis
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:11.580]  and cholera and and and leprosy. I mean, that's mainstream news. They don't even tell you
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:16.860]  that. Leprosy come on in. They bring in jihadis. They are attacking us. And speaking of that,
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:25.260]  if you get our biome defense, we also have it in the 25 billion per pill per capsule,
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:31.100]  25 billion live cultures. And so that's $39. And we have it with the 23 strains or you
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:38.980]  can get it with the larger bottle, larger tablets, 50 billion per pill for $69. You have

[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:59.580]  This has been holding the longest. Let's talk to James. We're going to be covering the debate
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:05.740]  live Sunday from four to 10, six hours. Always have the regular four to six. Then we'll have
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:09.020]  two hours of the debate. Then we'll carry the debate. Then we'll have at least an hour
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:16.260]  of phone calls and analysis after. That's one, two, three, four, five, seven hours. No rest
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:19.540]  for those that want to battle the wicked or maybe I was wicked in some other life. I don't
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:23.620]  believe in that, but there goes the joke. James and Tejas, you're on the air. Thanks
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:24.620]  for holding.
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:30.900]  Well, to add to Ann Marie's, what she said, God is with us all and make no mistake even
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:37.460]  if you don't have the faith. But I did want to say that this upcoming debate, Trump, Hillary
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:43.020]  wants to bring out the woman card. He needs to bring out the fact that Clinton says she's
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:47.660]  fighting for women, even though all the women that tried to come forward regarding bills,
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:52.940]  sexual assault, she refers to them as quote trailer trash and even threatens a lot of
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:58.300]  them in person. So I think that grabs their hands and crushes them. And look, I'll give
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.100]  it to her. She can, you know, she beats Bill up with astrays. I mean, she's a real deal.
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:07.980]  Exactly. And so if we bring up the point of how demonic she is and Trump brings that up
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:12.380]  in the debate with millions and millions of people tuning in, I think even a moron can
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:17.700]  add two and two together and say, okay, well, obviously this person isn't fit for presidency.
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.860]  And of course the mainstream media is going to demonize him. But what do you think about
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.900]  coming out of the gates and saying, I just want to say last week, they turned my mic
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:29.380]  off the audience and they had, you know, half levels during it so that I couldn't respond.
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.460]  The debate commission admits it. I was right about that. Hold on, Cooper. So you're already
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:37.780]  doing it. Do not interrupt me more than you interrupt her. Okay. Just just listen. Be
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:43.180]  fair. Do the right thing. Let me talk. He needs to, he needs to call them out instead
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:46.980]  of just letting them sit there. And then when he does get interrupted 100 times, it will
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:50.740]  absolutely blow up in their face. But he has to point it out. I mean, if you're in a football
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:55.420]  game and the refs are absolutely cheating for the other side, this is equivalent of
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:59.980]  like you see the ref being given a briefcase full of cash. And the ref, you know, the chief
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:05.580]  ref cheats the whole game. I mean, this is, this is 100 times worse than, you know, Pete
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.060]  Rose being caught gambling and then he was kicked out of baseball and should have been,
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:13.580]  you know, this is like ridiculously rigged. Since when is rigging? Okay, go ahead, James.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:18.180]  Yeah, that's right. And you know, if you bring it out, if Trump brings it out into the limelight,
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:21.500]  and I know last debate, he didn't do as good as we all thought he would, but I think he
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:26.420]  needs to hit her five times as hard as the basis or not go all out. But I think he needs
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:30.500]  to bring up a lot of points that will actually get people researching and get people looking
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:35.300]  at Clinton's past and really get people to wake up, you know,
[01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:39.580]  Absolutely. My friend, what are you doing to take action on the ground?
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:43.300]  I've done a lot. Actually, I just graduated high school a couple of years ago. And in
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:48.020]  that time, well, that's when I started listening to your show and started doing my own research
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:54.380]  and I remember usually I'm not trying to be, I'm not racist at all, but people will call
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:58.620]  me this just for saying it, but a lot of the minorities stick together in groups, especially
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:03.900]  in schools. And so what I would do is I would, I would make friends with a lot of the minorities.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:08.260]  Well, sure, it's all humans are tribal. And then they call that racism. The extreme version
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:11.620]  of tribalism is racism. But the point is, we should just all be honest about it. Go
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:12.620]  ahead.
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:16.860]  Right. And so I would get make friends with a lot of them. And then I'd ask them, we
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:19.820]  know, what do you think about Donald Trump? And they'd all tell me, you know, oh, he's
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:23.500]  a racist, he's a bigot, this and that. So I tell them, you know, why don't you go do
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:27.740]  your own research and come back and tell me or find me a quote, find me something, find
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:31.540]  me proof. And none of them could ever do that. And so they finally, a lot of them actually
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:35.660]  went up to me and said, wow, you know, I actually didn't know exactly. That's why they don't
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:39.540]  want quote minorities going to a tea party because they'll find out the truth that it's
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:44.780]  the least level of racism you'll ever experience. I mean, I'm telling you, folks, it's a fact
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:50.180]  Republicans are the ones that did the civil rights. We're on the March, the empires on
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:58.500]  the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:05.900]  Hillary Clinton has been caught in yet another staged fake town hall event as she takes questions
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:11.180]  from a child actor in Harvard, Pennsylvania. The mainstream media immediately picked up
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:23.940]  the clip and aired the footage nationwide. I see with my own eyes the damage Donald Trump
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:28.740]  does when he talks about women and how they look as the first female president. How would
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:32.380]  you undo some of that damage? But they failed to make the connection that
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:38.780]  the 15 year old girl is a child actor named Brennan Leach, whose father is a state senator
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:44.580]  and staunch reporter of Hillary's campaign. She's also appeared in political ads for her
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:51.300]  father featuring Bill Clinton. He seems like a great guy. I wouldn't let my daughter near
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:55.980]  that guy. And you can see more reports right now at info wars.com.

[01:33:32.720 --> 01:34:02.080]  All right. I'm going to run through Chris in Georgia.
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:06.720]  And Steve and Cindy and Tim and August and then I'm going to stop taking calls for a
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:10.800]  little while because Steve Quels joining us to get into this whole World War three scenario.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:15.720]  The Russians have launched a no fly zone around Syria. They were working with the United States
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:21.400]  the last few years to take out ISIS. And then finally, Obama was able to basically remove
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.720]  all the generals and admirals and put people in that will not work with the Russians. And
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:31.920]  they've been now targeting government forces on a daily basis, blowing up the Syrian military
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:35.960]  and Russians as well. And the Russians have said, Okay, well, you're going to announce
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.360]  a no fly zone. You're going to start shooting us down. Boom. No fly zone is now up. Anybody
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:46.440]  entering will be shot down. And there's almost no coverage in our media. Now this is not
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:51.240]  a good thing. Russia launches no fly zone threatens war with USA. Psychotic elite could
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:56.440]  ignite World War three. And that's what the head of the army said. Just a few days ago.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:02.000]  But the average trendy site writes articles saying I'm a fear monger. And I said this
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.520]  is exactly how it'll start is if the West tries to shoot down Russian planes or starts
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.680]  announcing no flies on the Russians will just do it. And so now the Russians are like, Okay,
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:16.440]  enter the airspace. We're going to shoot you down. And you know, they're going to fly
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:23.160]  US aircraft in there. Unless the pilots just say no. And then they get drug in in front
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.280]  of their commanders. And then it goes up the chain. And then they hear, Well, we've had
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:32.680]  half the pilots refused to attack. They're just cowards. General, why have you not attacked
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:38.400]  the Russians yet? Well, that'll mean war. We'll just use missiles. But then they'll respond.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:44.240]  But we missiles. Why don't you just stick here? You know what that light socket over there
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:54.240]  for me? That'll take care of it. So they did this about a year ago to make the West start
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:58.640]  doing the right thing and bombing the Elkada forces. But now it's been done again. So there
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:04.280]  you have it info wars.com. A new video is up today. It's very, very important. We stayed
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.880]  here very late last night to get this done. It's extremely powerful and extremely informative.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:11.760]  Now I'm going to go your calls bam, bam, bam right now. And then I want to get into
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:20.200]  this Paul Joseph Watson report. We're all trapped inside a simulation. Now I remember
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.040]  David, I say in that about 10 years ago, one of his latest books, of course, it had been
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:29.200]  said before that this is a matrix, you know, false reality. And that all came from Pentagon
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.800]  reports in the 70s that I mentioned earlier were declassified in 1999. And it was seen
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:39.480]  as theoretical then. Point is, I don't want to be inserted into your matrix. But if you
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.400]  look at the development, and I've always wanted to get a cartoonist to do a graphic of this,
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:49.920]  we ought to hire the guy that did the one on age screen links and Carl, the cuckoo's
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:56.760]  a really good animator or his team is. I'd say his name, but he's incognito gnome de
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:03.200]  plume. Because, you know, he exposes Islamists. So there's a lot of death threats. But getting
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:07.240]  back to what I was breaking down, where it shows the evolution, if you go along with
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:11.560]  evolution, just to educate the public and to use a paradigm they get of us from apes
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:15.680]  or whatever up to humans and bipedal. And then we're wearing spacesuits by the 60s.
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.240]  And then suddenly we start bending over our computers. And then now we're a little stunted
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:22.720]  creatures with an iPhone staring into it. And pretty soon it's goggles. And then it's
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:28.320]  a wire in our head. And then it's chips in our head. And then suddenly we're a computer.
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:33.800]  And the globalists want to direct this quote evolution. And the only evolution it's going
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:37.760]  to be, you know what, I'll just cover this now and then go to your calls. The only evolution
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:47.200]  it's going to be is that as a PKD predicted wire head, a cyberpunk, you're going to be
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:50.880]  able to have unlimited ecstasy, whatever you want for days, weeks, years, and I'll just
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:55.160]  wither away and be happy to die. And they'll tell you, you're going to be a simulation
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.960]  and still feel great forever. Just sign this form. And the government will say the program
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:03.640]  is really you and you'll sign the form. It'll just be some record of who you were. Unlimited
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:07.820]  facsimile and you'll be dead, but you'll sign the piece of paper because it's a giant con
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:17.800]  game saying you really entered another dimension that was a digital version of the third dimension.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:24.760]  So a false third dimension, not even a fourth dimension or fifth dimension or sixth dimension
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:34.440]  projection of a quantum mechanical system that we know is already verifiable. So this
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:40.400]  is a de-evolution, not an evolution. And you guys were getting me the big stack of news.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:46.840]  I saw you putting them on screen. Do I have that stack? Well, you're awesome. Oh, here
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:50.040]  it is right underneath these papers. Thank you so much, Nico. So since I said I'd cover
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:52.760]  this now, let me just go ahead and hit this for a few minutes, play the clip and then
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:57.960]  go back to your calls. But this is something we need to really talk about a lot. Now, here's
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:01.520]  some of the headlines. Just so you know, you're a new listener. You'll probably see this on
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:05.960]  MSNBC and they'll have me up here saying everything's a computer simulation and say that I'm insane
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:11.160]  and no one ever said this, but I'm just covering what they're saying. In reality, an illusion.
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:14.840]  Is reality an illusion? Scientists say we may be living in a computer simulated controlled
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:19.320]  by an evil genius. That's the Daily Mail. So what they're really saying is God's an evil
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:24.880]  genius. This isn't real, but we can give you the garden of Eden fruit that gives you the
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:32.880]  real knowledge of things and another reality outside of this evil creator's paradigm. But
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.280]  then you look what God actually gives us is everything good. We are almost definitely
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:43.200]  living in a matrix style simulation claims Elon Musk, the famous billionaire inventor.
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.040]  The Telegraph. Tech billionaires think we live in the matrix and have asked scientists to
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:55.040]  get us out CNBC. Elon Musk says there's a one in a billion chance reality is not a simulation.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:59.920]  Now, that's a very deceptive way. And I'm not attacking Elon Musk. I think the jury's
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:06.960]  out on him, but are any of these guys in terms of life is technology. But the point is these
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:12.720]  are kind of the gurus, you know, of this whole transhumanist movement now. And they say there's
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:16.160]  a one in a trillion chance or depending on the simulation that you could have life on
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:19.840]  Earth, the moons at the perfect spot, the suns at the perfect spot, we have all the
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.880]  right elements. Well, if you're out there in the universe with hundreds and hundreds
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:30.160]  of billions of known galaxies and trillions upon trillions of Google plexes of of of habitable
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.760]  worlds, you're going to end up being the lottery winner. You know, when you're the
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:40.680]  lottery winner, you're the lottery winner. It's like, how could life even exist? We're
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:48.720]  here experiencing it. So we're being injected into this matrix, this, this, this, this time
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:55.680]  square false reality they're trying to inject us into telling us the ocean isn't real, telling
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:59.040]  us our great, great grandparents weren't real, telling us birds in the sky aren't real, telling
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:06.440]  us little fish in the pond aren't real, telling us that love isn't real. But Pokemon Go is
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:10.240]  when really it's an admitted plan, they admit to have you walk around and go for Google
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:15.360]  Street View and videotape all the targets they want instead of having to pay for cars
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.400]  to do it. Plus humans can go into people's houses, they can go into people's businesses
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.200]  and chronicle everything and they admit that's the platform they want. But all the little
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:28.880]  trendies that think this is the real world, the fake matrix they're being given, they
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.680]  then always get mad at me and think I'm trying to take their video games away and I'm trying
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:39.320]  to take away new horizons and new worlds for them. No, I'm not. I'm explaining to you that
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:44.880]  the Pokemon Go or the world of Warcraft or any of this stuff statistically makes you
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.360]  depressed, makes you make less money, makes you not have friends, makes you delusional
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:59.960]  and unhealthy and is a world made by someone else. So you can say we don't know who made
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:05.440]  this world but it's big and you can sit there with a powerful telescope at night and look
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:11.160]  at the rings of Saturn or the moons of Jupiter, magnified thousands of times like a little
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:17.720]  marble in your eye and it's like down the block and you can go to a vista and look
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:25.440]  down the block into an eternity of eons of light years with trillions of more galaxies
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:33.360]  upon trillions of more for infinity and then we're supposed to listen to the men who run
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:37.560]  the little tinker toy computer systems. They're telling us they're about to be gods, merge
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:44.920]  with things, humans are obsolete, humans are over out of one side of their mouth. Bill
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:51.440]  Joy, Ray Kurzweil, the globalist, that's their religion. But oh, there's some evil
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:56.760]  entity, that's what they say, running all of this that suppressed us and they're going
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:05.200]  to build a reality. It's better. So holding your daughter's hand when I was driving home
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:11.360]  from dinner last night with my daughter and I was holding her hand and that isn't real.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:15.560]  Ancestral memories aren't real. My brainwaves aren't real. See, this is just a more jacked
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:19.360]  up version of the atheist saying you're all animals, you're stupid, there is no free will
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:24.480]  but let us run things. Just give up, there is no free will, let us run things. Now they've
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.080]  just gone ahead and said okay, nobody's buying that. Okay, there's an evil entity controlling
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.880]  everything and it built this whole fake thing and it's imprisoning you. But if you'll just
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.800]  come into our little system we built, it'll give you unlimited pleasure and blah blah blah.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.680]  Well you can't just be given unlimited pleasure. That's all part of the struggle to build the
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:44.240]  next level. But they're just, it's all quick, it's all easy. Just plug this in, there won't
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:54.280]  be any more pain. Just take this shot, we'll get you ready for the show. These are drug
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:44:02.480]  dealers. These are high tech sorcerers. They're busy worried about their Mars bases while
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:06.960]  telling you oh, you don't like planet Earth, we're building something very special. But
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:10.080]  we want you to go live in compact cities and 200 square foot apartments, those are the
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:15.840]  big ones. Pay us all your money and then be so unhappy that we say okay, you're unhappy.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:19.640]  Go to our next level. Okay, I'll upgrade. I'm even more unhappy. It's all right, come
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:23.800]  to the next level. All right, I'll upgrade. Oh God, it's even worse. Just give up total
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:28.720]  consciousness to the great cloud and you will be with all these other great minds and people
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:34.640]  and no more pain, no more individuality. Just give yourself to Nirvana, our artificial Nirvana.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:38.720]  Just beam yourself up. Oh my gosh, you're going to be raptured. The Christians are told
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:43.280]  you're going to be raptured. Well now there's the New Age rapture, the New World Order rapture.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:45:01.400]  Interate. Interate. Oh yes, oh loving, liberal. Beyond THX 1138. So this is what's going on.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:05.520]  At every level, this is the real reality and of course there's other dimensions you name
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.160]  it. But everything the power structure does is just to keep you as dumb down as possible
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.560]  where people think islands are floating and you know, Donald Trump's a racist and just
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:18.040]  total cuckoo land. And I kept telling you the top atheists and they make a big joke
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:22.600]  about this on media. Alex says a lot of atheists are actually a cultist. I've experienced it.
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:27.880]  I've been in bohemian grove. I've covered skull and bones. I know what the theosophic
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:32.440]  society pushes and all this. You are the profane. You're not even meant to know there's
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:36.760]  a spiritual world, which just means other dimensions. You're not supposed to understand
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:43.600]  that there is dimensions below us and above us. You are profane. You do not enter the
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:51.000]  temple. And so you have all these weird little disenfranchised losers, hateful of life, loving
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.760]  of death, empty, no family, no future, just going around and going, I'm an atheist. There
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:04.160]  are no, no God. There is no secrets. Totally controlled blind. Now there are a lot of people
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.560]  that hate organized religion, the establishment who say, I don't believe in God because if
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:12.080]  there's a real God, he's a sadist. I can get those people, but the ones that are the liberal,
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:17.720]  the state's God, humans are God, the state's God, it's going to bring me to nirvana. It's
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:24.040]  going to bring me to Valhalla. It's going to bring me there, but only after the Ragnarok,
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:28.640]  Guder Damarang, you know, is played out and we have a world war and then we transcend to
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:36.520]  the next level. And I don't have free will, but you're going to run my life. So let's
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:41.640]  go to Paul Joseph Watson's report. I'm going to come back with a final key point, but here's
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:53.040]  the bottom line. Synthetic, just to dumb it down. Silicon is square. It's a crystal.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:47:01.800]  It's artificial. It doesn't go to another dimension. Life has memories and a transmission
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:12.200]  and is round. Just to dumb it down. Life is round. Real is organic. Synthetic is artificial
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:19.720]  and there's a synthetic invasion taking over, telling you this is the fraud. Go with it.
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:24.880]  Eat the apple. You don't get advanced knowledge. You get the corrupting virus of the knowledge
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:31.040]  of the silicon. Let's go ahead and go to Paul's report. Two secret billionaires think we're
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:36.640]  all living inside a video game simulation and are working with scientists in a desperate
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:43.200]  effort to help humanity break out. Say what? No, this isn't an episode of the X-Files.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:48.080]  According to entrepreneur and venture capitalist Sam Altman, elitists are obsessed with the
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:54.080]  idea that what we perceive to be reality is actually just the Sims on a grand scale. What
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:59.020]  does that mean? The argument is pretty straightforward. Computing technology has advanced so much
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:04.800]  in the last 40 years that at some point we're going to be able to create video game simulations
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:10.360]  that are indistinguishable from reality. And if that's the case, how do we know it hasn't
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:15.080]  already happened? And hit pause. Wow. Back it up a few seconds because I want to explain
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:21.840]  something for new viewers. These are artificial realities programmed by other humans so you're
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:27.200]  entering their universe and their world under their laws and their parameters. They're God
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:34.400]  in that system. You understand? And you don't have free will. They always ratchet it down.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:39.040]  The real God gives you free will, which is why there's evil. Because it has a chance
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:43.560]  to try to sell you on its false reality that you have to give up your humanity. In this
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:50.240]  real dimension, you are visiting with other people that have genetic memory similar to
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:55.400]  yours and have whole histories and things we can't even compute or understand layered
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:00.720]  on each other over and over and over and over and over and over again. And then interdimensional
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:05.680]  genetic structures that resonate with higher dimensions. The elite all know this by the
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.200]  way and obsessed with it. And they're creating an artificial cage, the equivalent of a dirty
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.800]  cat box they want you to go live in when you instead of living in the beautiful foothills
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:21.160]  of the Colorado mountains at a majestic lake where you could actually meet a woman who
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:27.440]  has a whole past or a man, have children, merge your genetic lines in love spiritually
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:34.880]  combining with them in a galactic ritual. That's why they can constantly attack it.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:42.480]  And then it's a loving force in the universe of creation and procreation and building and
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:54.280]  taking raw dead matter, rocks, silicate, crystals and then creating giant sequoia redwoods out
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:59.480]  of it that symbiotically live with all the other creatures within it. And then planets
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:05.880]  themselves are eggs for the advanced life form to then spring forth out of it and then
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:12.360]  to go to a next level. That's God's promise. They want you to enter some silicate garbage
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:18.760]  they built. Look at it. It's why it makes you depressed. It makes you fat. It's why
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:22.720]  it makes you commit suicide. And the slicker it gets, the worse it gets. And their problem
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:27.920]  is Google Glasses, they spent tens of billions trying to force feed them. No one uses them.
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:37.080]  No one hates them because it's not human. It oppresses us. It takes us out of our atmosphere.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.240]  That's why they take real love from you. It's why they take family from you. It's why they
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:45.640]  take culture from you. So you can then have little robot fake friends mixed in with the
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:54.000]  real ones in the fake virtual reality to have your soul absolutely shuttered. That's why
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.760]  they want to make the law that you can't let your kids be out in the sun. That's Cass
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:05.680]  Sunstein, the White House regulations are. He wants a law that you cannot have sunlight.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:15.000]  And we're one step away from the tanks. And you ask, where does humans get this? Well,
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:21.720]  the Bible says there's an evil fallen entity that was corrupt and bad and hauled ass and
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:29.400]  can't deal with what God's doing. And so it has to screw around with us, which is all
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:38.680]  part of God's plan because God doesn't want a bunch of jellyfish. God wants his children.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:44.000]  Pull back and really think about what the Bible is really saying to be hardened, to
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.760]  be strengthened, to be tested. And so everybody wants to go to space and everybody wants to
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:53.360]  be part of the future. If you're in the Starfleet training, folks, you figure that out yet?
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:52:00.360]  This is it. This is it right now. This is a high tech warrior in right now. They're
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:04.640]  blasting the hell out of people, man. People are dizzy. They're falling down. They're brain
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:09.840]  damaged. I mean, they're hitting us hard, man, because they're not just killing people's
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:14.640]  bodies, folks. They are. They are basically hammering people's souls, getting people tied
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:20.160]  into this and then just sucking them dry and just cut them to pieces. And they're shadows
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:26.760]  of what they would have been. Beautiful creatures. Beautiful creatures made in God's image being
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:33.600]  just sucked apart by a pack of intergalactic demons. And that's what the elite really believe.
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:36.920]  And they make jokes about me 10 years ago talking about this. And now you see they're
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:43.520]  telling you, but they tell you that God created all this is the devil. No, they're the devil.
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:50.160]  Back to Paul Watcher's report. Wow. Two tech billionaires have gone so far as to secretly
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:55.960]  engage scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation, Altman told the New Yorker.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:53:02.040]  Elon Musk thinks it's almost inevitable that civilization, as we know it, is actually just
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:06.760]  one giant simulation. 40 years ago, we had Pong, like two rectangles
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:15.200]  in a dot. That was what games were. Now, 40 years later, we have photorealistic 3D simulation
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:18.560]  and most are sperm or dead playing simultaneously, and it's getting better every year.
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:24.800]  Hit pause. I'm gonna say this again. Notice as it advances. 20, 30 years ago, maybe 10%
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:30.600]  of the sperm were deficient or dead. Now it's over 90% in the West. Soon they'll be basically
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:36.600]  infertility across the board. So notice, we had Pong 30 years ago now look out and
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:43.120]  yeah, and we're dying. We're dying exactly. It grows, we die. It grows, we die. It grows,
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:51.080]  we die. Let's continue. Soon we'll have virtual reality, a moment in reality. If you assume...
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:54.840]  That's right. It won't be a hit pause again. It won't be a real woman or a real man. It
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:54:01.200]  won't be, no, it'll just be, oh, any porn star I want in virtual reality. And oh, the
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:04.480]  simulation's so much better if you just take the little brain chip. It's so easy. It's
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:12.680]  like an hour long procedure. You think they put back door stuff on your cell phone? Let's
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:16.080]  continue. You think the phone company rips you off now? How about you put a phone company
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:26.440]  chip in your cerebral cortex? Oh, but then it's gonna be so wonderful. Let's go back.
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:33.520]  If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.720]  from reality. The odds that we're in base reality is one in billions. Hit pause again.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.760]  Tell me what's wrong with that argument. Back it up 20 seconds. So what this is, folks,
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:49.000]  this is an assault on reality. I don't know if Musk understands this or doesn't. I'm sure
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:56.600]  he does. Probably in an initiative. He wants to come on and correct us. He can. But notice,
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:01.640]  he's just saying this is one in a billion that it's not a simulation. It is a simulation.
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:06.120]  He's not real. It's done. Don't defend it. It didn't exist. You never had free will.
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:10.600]  Join us. Now, if he was had like a black helmet on, it was like, we are the Borg assimilator
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:17.120]  in this road. You'd be like, no battle. He's like, oh, yeah, more spaces here, dude. Yeah,
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:22.000]  it's really trendy. Let me talk to really soft on threatening. Let me have my eyes real
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:31.520]  soft. I'm not threatening. Come closer. Oh, excuse me. Can we tell Kurzweil?
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:37.520]  Stop admitting we're going to kill everybody. I'm liberal liberal. Let's go back years ago.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:44.840]  We had pong like two rectangles and a dot. That was what games were. Now 40 years later,
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:49.800]  we have photo realistic 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.880]  and it's getting better every year. And soon we'll have, you know, but virtual reality of
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:03.440]  augmented reality. If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:07.440]  become indistinguishable from reality. The odds that we're in base reality is one in
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:14.280]  billions. Tell me what's wrong with that argument. He also said that that's probably a good thing
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:19.080]  because the alternative is the complete destruction of humanity. Either we're going to create
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:23.760]  simulations that are indistinguishable from reality or civilization will cease to exist.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:29.240]  And if our brains and our impulses are completely simulated, breaking out of the matrix as these
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:35.040]  billionaires are pushing for would mean ceasing to exist. Enumerable scientists, physicists
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.720]  and futurists agree that it's almost certain the universe is a simulation. If simulating
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:47.480]  universes becomes a pastime among those who have access to high powerful to highly powerful
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:52.880]  computers, and we are in a universe, we are probably in a simulated universe, even if
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:57.080]  one of those universes is actually real. This universe could have been created by a pause.
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.600]  We're going to come back and put the last few minutes up and go to your phone calls
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:04.400]  and Steve Quill, but they just hit me. Can you imagine Lucifer shitting around telling
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:08.400]  people just like this over communication systems whenever, and you're going to be gods and
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:12.040]  this whole thing's fake in a simulation. And so yeah, you weren't really created by this.
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:17.360]  Let's break out and build our own thing. I mean, whether the devil's real or not, we
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:23.280]  are witnessing unified academics, all of them going, my children, it's all fake. It
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:36.120]  matter if it's real, join us. Wires in your head. Oh, oh, oh, it feels so good now. And
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:39.120]  you look at the cult likeness, they all have this weird look on their face like they're
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:44.400]  just like, oh, children, it's time to merge with the EverBrain. Oh, the UN is going to
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:49.840]  sponsor Zeitgeist movement. A robot will tell us what to do. Computers look at old man.
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:55.920]  He made neat models and painted things. He'll teach us about collectivism run by robots.
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:04.800]  Oh, robots, love me. And then who runs the robots? Who programs them? So Paul Watson's
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:09.080]  reports up on inforwers.com. This is something we've talked about for so long. And now though
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:13.920]  they've gone operational was just not just you will take vaccines or will arrest you.
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:18.600]  So the news, it's like, you will take augmentation. You are not with the group. You're hurting
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:27.600]  people. Just join us in the heaven. Childhood's in. Give up. You will join us. Oh, it's Friday,

[01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:05.040]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:23.040]  All right, here's the rest of Paul Watson's report, the full thing uninterrupted in PaulWars.com.
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:30.040]  His angle was, are we trapped inside a video game? This is just the ultimate con game trying
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:39.360]  to get us to then just give up reality and submit to their false reality. It's a microcosm
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:43.960]  of them trying to force feed us Hillary Clinton or them having hired actors at fake press
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:48.800]  conferences. I mean, you know, this is well beyond that. These people are the opposite
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:55.800]  of God. Let's finish the clip. Simulating universes becomes a past time among those
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:01:03.280]  who have access to highly powerful computers. And we are in a universe, we are probably
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:07.360]  in a simulated universe even if one of those universes is actually real. This universe could
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:14.160]  have been created by some superintelligence in another universe. So maybe where our whole
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:19.160]  universe is a junior high school science experiment of some superintelligent junior high school
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:26.160]  scientist. Maybe she won't get such a good grade. Richard Dawkins isn't convinced.
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:32.400]  When you make a simulated world, and there are crude ones like Second Life, there has
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:38.120]  to be a physics built into it. And when you drop things, they fall and when you throw
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:43.200]  them up and catch them, it works. But you can violate that physics. The pimply youth
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:50.240]  doing the simulation can somehow just at will change the physics and you could suddenly
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:55.160]  fly as you need you can in Second Life. We don't see that. Another argument is that
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:02:01.240]  civilizations never become advanced enough to make simulations before wiping themselves
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:06.960]  out. Therefore, it's impossible. But the characteristics of quantum mechanics are exactly what we would
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:12.840]  expect to see in a simulation. There's a limit to the resolution with which we can observe
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:19.000]  the universe. It just becomes fuzzy like pixels on a TV screen if you get too close, again
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.200]  suggesting that we could be trapped inside a complex video game. Subatomic particles
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:30.360]  like quarks also resemble the codes that correct for errors in computers. So you're saying
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:50.960]  as you dig deeper, you find computer code written in the fabric of the cosmos. You might
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:57.280]  feel denigrated that your life is just a character in a video game, that we have no real free
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:03.640]  will and that our behavior is programmed. But think of it this way. If our civilization
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:11.640]  is a computer simulation, if we're all living in the matrix, at least it means we have a
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:12.640]  creator.
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:20.640]  Wow. That's right. And again, folks, this has come out a long time ago and they've done
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:26.840]  this with the dark matter, telescopes, radio frequencies, that there's matter of an entirely
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:35.640]  different type that has a much bigger gravitational field outside and this is controlled and projected,
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:39.680]  which all the ancients do. But the very people that tell you there is no God and there is
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:44.840]  nothing outside all this, well, more and more of the quantum mechanics and the mathematicians
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:47.920]  and the genetic engineers actually become religious. That's why most of the New York
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:53.360]  Times and Michigan Aliens put us here. Okay, well, who made them? But listen, you can only
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:56.800]  listen to them, though, and they're going to make a simulation that's better, which is
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:02.080]  their God. You understand that? So they're like, going, hey, there's computer code here.
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:06.440]  It's not computer code. When they zoom into that, there's always pieces to quarks and
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:12.920]  more and more, and it just keeps going down and down and down and down and down. So this
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:20.360]  is the scientists going, wow, something did make this. Wow. That even discredits the religious
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:28.080]  people even more because this is exactly what we've been saying all along. Every culture.
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:33.560]  So we're here discovering, but they never want you to look out at the night sky, never
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:37.080]  look out at the sun, never look at it like all the way we're at how incredible it is.
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:41.760]  It's just like, no, instead, let's look at how beautiful Chelsea is or that gown. It's
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:48.920]  all these like ringwraith, skexy, weirdo psychos of the opposite of, you know, God telling
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:54.120]  us their God because there is no God. Your calls coming up with Steve quell and a lot
[02:04:54.120 --> 02:05:00.640]  more stay with us. Chris and others are called straight ahead. I'm all shows drug raid 81
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:04.800]  year old Margaret Holcomb was minding her own business in her humble home with her son
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:09.960]  when all of the sudden she was part of a full blown drug raid. This wasn't a wrongful raid
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:15.240]  on an incorrect address as we've seen in the past. No, no, they caught a fish with this
[02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:21.720]  one literally one fish. After all, Margaret had one marijuana plant growing in her backyard
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:27.960]  garden. Get the choppers get the National Guard. Take this woman down. The joint raid
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:32.840]  between the National Guard and the Massachusetts state police, which also included a military
[02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:39.120]  helicopter was successful and they were able to take down the one marijuana plant. A job
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:44.480]  well done boys. Now Margaret will have to find a nice legal pharmaceutical to ease her
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:49.480]  arthritis and glaucoma. Now does the war on drugs make sense to you? This is Owen shroyer

[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:21.040]  31 days from the historic election. This is the Alex Jones show. Alex Jones. This Sunday
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:29.040]  is 4 to 10. 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. We're going to have a special live broadcast. The first
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:32.920]  two hours of course is the Sunday show. I've been doing it for 10 years. That's from 4
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:40.160]  to 6 p.m. Then we'll have two hours of pregame ahead of it. We do have our guests, correct?
[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:46.240]  Great. I forgot to ask during the break. And then we'll have live coverage during the debate
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:51.640]  and then phone calls for at least an hour or so and analysis and highlights afterwards.
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:55.400]  Now I promise Chris has been holding them to get to you soon. Steve Quayle won't mind.
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:09:00.400]  You can talk about any subject. And Steve in Florida and Cindy and Tim in August. I'm
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:03.560]  going to go to you very quickly. Get your calls out of the way because you've been holding
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:10.760]  and then get into all the other issues with Steve Quayle. But first off, I wanted to play
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:15.680]  a few clips here because Steve's really been warning frantically the last year about war
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:20.560]  with Russia. And we're not saying Russia's perfect. We're not again lionizing Russia.
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:25.800]  But General Flynn, who's Trump's main advisor, was removed two years ago because he wouldn't
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:30.920]  aid al-Qaeda slash ISIS in the takeover of the Middle East. And that's why Trump has
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:35.040]  come out and said Hillary and Obama basically created ISIS. That's a fact. Oh, I have the
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:38.640]  headline here out of RT. This is what the Russians are saying, RT. Covert strikes on
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:50.120]  Assad back on U.S. Table DC now openly backs ISIS. Russia post provocative tweet warning
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:57.080]  U.S. on Syria mocking the press secretary and basically saying we know you that you run
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:01.960]  ISIS and al-Qaeda. U.S. Army chief three days ago threatens war with Russia. We've played
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:10.440]  that clip. Russia tells citizens, prepare for nuclear war. 40 million are in a drill.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:15.720]  So it goes on and on massive escalation. Here's another one, London independent. Russia warns
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:19.360]  U.S. not to intervene in Syria threatens to shoot down any airstrike attempts. That was
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:26.640]  last night. Our headline on info wars.com with a produced 11 minute report shows all
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:31.240]  the clips, all the facts. Russia said, oh, you're having no fly zone to back ISIS and
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:35.720]  al-Qaeda, but your own military helped expose and fight. We've got to know fly zone up
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:39.080]  and we don't know who your aircraft is. You come in, we're going to shoot you down because
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:43.520]  U.S. and NATO aircraft suddenly aren't announcing where they are and they're bombing the Syrian
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:48.280]  military and that has Russian advisors inside of it. So this is the deception that's going
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:52.880]  on in our own military exposed this four years ago, did the right thing. Obama has now removed
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:56.240]  all the generals, put people in that will follow their orders. I'm not saying they're
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:00.320]  excitedly following them because you see the head of the army and the Joint Chief Chairman
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:06.380]  saying, okay, we'll attack the Russians, but that means World War Three. And the army chief
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:11.080]  said this will be a war as big as World War Two. And he said, we're ready to do it. But
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:14.520]  he said, you know, Congress needs to have a debate about this. Both the chairman of the
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:21.120]  Joint Chiefs, Dumford and General Milley, the head of the army have said, we're ready for
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:26.040]  war. You're asking us to have war. We need to have a debate. So that's an alarm, folks.
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:30.040]  Okay, because the average Americans busy calling Donald Trump racist and, you know, a warmonger
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:33.840]  because he doesn't want to have war with Russia. The truth is Russia is not advancing on us.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:38.960]  China is. This is crazy. Could this be Hillary's October surprise? Because CNN two weeks ago
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:43.400]  said, hey, by the middle of October, and we're almost there, we're seven days in now, there
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:48.720]  will be an event geopolitically so big, it will challenge both Hillary and Trump. Is
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:53.200]  it Deutsche Bank going under that? I got a hand into him like eight months ago. Larry
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:57.160]  Nichols talked about six months ago. Our current guest talked about now that's going belly
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:03.000]  up bigger than 2007. I don't know, but things are crazy. I want to talk about all the bad
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.560]  stuff happening so cooler minds can prevail so it doesn't happen. I'm not a prophet of
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:12.360]  destruction, you know, hoping all the stuff happens. I'm telling you, if we don't admit
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:16.200]  these dangers are there, it could happen. And we've never been closer. Mainline analysts
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:22.200]  say which is the most danger we've ever been in ever in the history of civilization. So
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:24.560]  let's go ahead and play this clip with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs just two weeks
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:28.320]  ago when Congress in the longer hour long interview is saying, we want you to hit the
[02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:33.920]  Russians, we want you to take out their airfields. This is our so-called ally. This is the new
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:37.360]  change. This is what Hillary wants. This is what Obama wants. And he says, okay, we can
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:42.360]  do that, but that means war with Russia. Here it is for Syria. What about the option of controlling
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:49.440]  the airspace so that that barrel bombs cannot be dropped? All the options. What do you think
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:55.400]  of that option, sir? Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:13:04.040]  would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia. Okay, now, I want to play. I'm
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:06.560]  sorry, I didn't know it was over. You guys, Pomp and Circumstance, it was over. Let's
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.480]  start over again. I'm playing unedited one more time. This is important. Play one more
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:14.920]  time from the beginning for everybody. Here it is. For Syria, what about the option of
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:22.160]  controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped? All the options. What do
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:27.760]  you think of that option, sir? Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:36.560]  in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia. That's a pretty fundamental
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:42.400]  decision that certainly I'm not going to make. So this is the psychotic disconnect of Hillary
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:48.400]  and Obama and the neocons. And again, Russia's not doing anything. They were invited in four
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:52.000]  years ago to try to defeat these groups. They've almost beat ISIS, and now they don't want
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.080]  Assad in. They want to double cross now. And Russia's like, Assad's going to leave as soon
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:00.120]  as this is done. We're going to keep our word. Now, if Russia doesn't, then we can say, oh,
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:03.840]  that was a big lie or maybe sanctions. But no, no, they want big sanctions now outside
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:08.480]  the UN. It's all happening. Global crisis right out of Daniel, right out of revelations.
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:12.280]  One more clip, and I'm going to Steve Quell of Steve Quell.com. Army Chief of Staff. This
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:18.960]  is two days ago. Mark Milley warned that the United States was ready to destroy its enemies
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.880]  and said we've never faced such a threat since World War Two. Here it is. I want to be clear
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:29.840]  to those who try to oppose the United States. I want to be clear to those who wish to do
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:37.720]  us harm. I want to be clear to those around the world want to destroy our way of life
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:45.360]  and that of our allies and friends. The United States military, despite all our challenges,
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:52.120]  despite our op tempo, despite everything we've been doing, will stop you and we will beat
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:58.040]  you harder than you've ever been beaten before. Make no mistake about that. Other countries,
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:04.000]  Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea went to school on us. They closely watched how we
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:10.200]  fought in 91 and 03. They studied our doctrine, our tactics, our equipment, our organization,
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:15.720]  our training, and our leadership. And in turn, they revised their own doctrines and they
[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:22.040]  are rapidly modernizing the military today to avoid our strengths in hopes of defeating
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:28.400]  us at some point in the future. Recently, a senior Russian official ambassador to the
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:35.060]  United Kingdom, Alexander Karamenko, he said, quote, the established world order is undergoing
[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:41.920]  a foundational shakeup with the Crimea, Ukraine, and Brexit. He went on to call for the dismantling
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:48.960]  of NATO and the European Union. And he said, quote, Russia can now fight a conventional
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:55.200]  war in Europe and win. Russia is the only country that will remain relevant forever.
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.720]  Any other country is dispensable. And that includes the United States. We are in game
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:09.040]  now, end quote. We can now and we will remain in the future, retain the capability to rapidly
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:17.560]  to deploy and and we will destroy any enemy anywhere, anytime. Additionally, the battlefield
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:24.000]  will be highly complex, almost certainly in dense urban areas and against an elusive,
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:30.760]  ambiguous enemy that combines terrorism and guerrilla warfare alongside conventional capabilities
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:38.680]  mixed with large civilian populations. And the one part we didn't get in the clip, the
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:46.440]  full video on info wars.com is Millie cautioned that the next major conflict would be lethal,
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:51.680]  highly lethal, unlike any our army has experienced at least since World War Two. And then it
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:55.600]  goes on from there. Now, here's the issue. It's our government bringing in the jihadis.
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:17:00.560]  It's our government funding and financing these enemies. The EU is a private corporate
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:05.560]  takeover. So what he's saying is I work for the globalist. And if you think the UK is
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:08.640]  going to leave and Russia is going to leave, no, you're going under a global empire, we're
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:16.360]  ready to attack you. It was a very treasonous statement to imply that the EU shouldn't break
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:22.200]  up and that the UK shouldn't be free. This is globalism. Steve quail. Epic times were
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:27.240]  in Steve quail.com. I got talking about this for decades. Best selling author don't really
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:31.960]  needed an introduction. That's a long introduction to you. But I wanted to, you know, break down
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:35.040]  all this. What do you make of this? What are your sources saying?
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:40.660]  Well, first of all, Alex, I've never had so many insiders trying to get the attention
[02:17:40.660 --> 02:17:45.840]  of the American people as in the last probably two weeks. Number one, let's go to the bottom
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:52.400]  line. The bottom line there has never been a 40 million person evacuation of any country
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:58.760]  in any drill ever. I'll go on record saying this is not a drill. This is the pre-placement
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:03.080]  of a population. Now, people have got to understand something. I used to write about Russian war
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:09.980]  doctrine. Civil defense is an integral part of their plan to both survive a nuclear war
[02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:15.800]  and thrive after nuclear war. The population of Moscow is 12 million. So they have just
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:23.800]  basically moved close to 43 times the population of Moscow. Every subway, every underground
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:32.400]  cold war bunker, Yamantel, the mountains in the Urals, everything is on a feverish pace.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.720]  When you put frontline weapons into Syria, when you put frontline weapons bordering NATO,
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:40.520]  when multiple times the Russians have demonstrated they're not...
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:42.520]  And by the way, I hate to interrupt you. I'm going to give you the floor and I'm just getting
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:45.400]  this break. It's so important. Steve quail. I remember you saying 20 years ago,
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:50.960]  it just hit me when you said it, when the Russians move large populations out of their
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:55.320]  cities, which they've never done, that is a sign that they're preparing for nuclear war.
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:19:00.040]  And for the first time ever, they just did a drill of 40 million. We can't get 2 million
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:03.800]  out of the East Coast. Imagine how big that was and how pre-planned that was. Are you
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:09.440]  saying they actually stayed outside? Well, here's the thing. It is not just a drill.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:15.680]  And Alex, the thing that everyone's missing is China embarked on the same policy also.
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:23.520]  So the fact is that understand this, understand a nuclear ultimatum. Let's say someone shoots
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:30.600]  the first missile, okay? The minute they make the first launch, then all hell breaks loose.
[02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:36.680]  But at some point, what happens when six cities in America, I'm just taking that arbitrary,
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:45.640]  six to 13 cities in America, that's not arbitrary, disappear, and quite candidly, our whole rest
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:51.040]  of the population is at risk. See, this is insane. Americans who are listening to this
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:58.320]  from all over the world, this is a part of war doctrine. They can shield one-third to
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:02.840]  one-half of their population. There is no shielding for the American population. Alex,
[02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:08.800]  you and I did the show on the DEGLE survey where they said at some point, 65 million
[02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:13.320]  people are left. We have no COG for local government and the
[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:16.800]  citizens. It's all for the elite. Russia has it for their citizens.
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:22.800]  Right. And we have multitudes of multiples in the hundreds of thousands of foreign UN
[02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:28.880]  troops here. And we're looking, listen, we're looking at a bunch of, I would say this, Democrats
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:36.360]  and Republicans slime that think that World War III is basically a video game with a reset.
[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:41.680]  And this is the total globalist nightmare to take down the Western world and pretty
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:47.360]  much the entire world to bring about their globalist reign and rule of antichrist, one
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:50.440]  world government, one world religion, one world currency.
[02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:55.040]  So right now, what we're seeing, and by the way, the weather that are going on, the weather
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:59.920]  warfare that's taking place on the East Coast with the skull, I think that's the mockery
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:04.480]  of the Illuminous because obviously you've spent a lifetime doing all your videos on
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:08.280]  the skull and bones and everything that's attributed to the globalist.
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:15.000]  So what we're seeing right now is a scaling up. Even Vitaly Shurkin went to the UN as
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:19.240]  saying, back off, you guys, back off, you guys. I'll tell you one thing about Russia
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:24.120]  and since I've written about their generals, I pay attention to what they say. I don't
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:29.240]  dismiss them like some Pentagon analyst or some general who's popping up his breath.
[02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:34.040]  First of all, Russia can penetrate all our stealth capabilities. They've demonstrated
[02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:42.240]  before. Second of all, we can't do their stealth capabilities because they have a plasma absorption
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:47.680]  screen, which means that any signal sent and any frequency is automatically absorbed and
[02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:52.120]  does not feed back to the transmitter identifying its location. Remember, Alex, you and I did
[02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:57.280]  a show talking about, you've done so many on your own, about talking about when the
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:02.480]  Russian makes old technology, flew over our aircraft carriers and the pilots, they went
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:07.640]  in burden, flipped off the guys on the flight deck and they did it numerous times. The Donald
[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:12.800]  Cook, which was forced three times. I think it's not, I said two, it's three times.
[02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:17.520]  Sure, and Chinese subs popping up behind the submarines were clearly being set up. It's
[02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:21.320]  just like a lot of other people have broken down the fact that they're trying to lure
[02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:25.920]  them into an attack to actually take out their enemy, the American people, our local governments
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:30.160]  and our state governments. The globalists can't bring down America, so they want a war to
[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:35.120]  finally bring it down, then say all of us that are patriots against NAFTA, against
[02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:40.080]  CAT, against the EU, you know, for Brexit, we're now Russian agents. It's perfect. And
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:43.720]  you heard the general say, you're a Russian agent, basically, if you're for the Brexit
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:48.320]  or the breakup of the EU, and we'll get you. He's telling that to Donald Trump, basically.
[02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:53.400]  Absolutely. And they have a lot of hellfire missiles. I want to explain something how
[02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:58.520]  this will play out, because it's not just the tanks, the armored personnel carriers,
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:04.160]  all of the stuff you see on the trains across the country. We have a vast amount of underground
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:09.640]  tunnels, bases and deep underground military bunkers, a vast amount of helicopters loaded
[02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:13.920]  with hellfire missiles. So everything you have watched in the Middle East is what they
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:18.920]  plan to use here. The U.S. military has a doctrine, yard farming. That means they're
[02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:24.880]  going against us. So they're provoking Russia. And I can tell you this, Russian policy, every
[02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:31.640]  single general that's ever quoted, Medvedev, Putin, obviously, President Putin, they all
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:36.480]  have, how do they say this, reserve first strike capability. Even our nuclear war doctrine
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:43.600]  has changed. But the problem is, when you have an entire military congress, I'm talking
[02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:48.600]  about the U.S., all of our battle-hardened generals, admirals have been fired, dismissed,
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:54.760]  or basically embarrassed out of their positions. The U.S. military is suffering intentional,
[02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:59.480]  and I'm saying this, cut-offs of ammunition. There's even cases where the Navy pulls into
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:04.040]  Hong Kong or Singapore, and they're not allowed to fuel their boats with any form of treasury
[02:24:04.040 --> 02:24:08.240]  instrument or anything. They have to produce either silver or gold. And that's a real
[02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:14.960]  true story. So here's where we're at. We're at the escalation point. My number one goal
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:21.720]  is to warn the people as best as I can when all of the Airborne Command and Control Centers
[02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:26.640]  are up, the E-6s, the 747s, all the AWACS planes are up, all our sub-hundreds are up.
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:33.160]  The Doomsday Plains. The Doomsday Plains. That's never happened before. The thing that
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:38.200]  people ought to recognize is the Twitter feed coming out of the Russian embassy. If you
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:44.160]  hear the Russian embassy is vacating or even they're threatening, then you know this thing
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:48.640]  is on. By the way, Pearl Harbor from the time the Japanese broke off negotiations, I don't
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:53.440]  think most people recognize this. One day. That was actually 30 minutes. 30 minutes.
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:58.760]  They started pulling out quickly, but yeah. Yeah, but the deal is, what I'm saying is
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:03.720]  we're the ones that broke off. Then you've got Kerry, you know, who's absolutely in another
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:10.960]  universe and an alternate space and, you know, quantum quagmire bill, basically saying that,
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:15.880]  you know, well, we've got to bring the Russians before the war crime discord. You're kidding
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:21.560]  me? When our government openly turns jihadis loose all over the world. Absolutely. And
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:27.000]  here's what's thinking. I mean, here's what people have to be thinking at this point.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:34.280]  This is not a normal escalation of words. Stop is moving. I got emails from. Well, what
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:38.240]  do you make of the Russian saying any aircraft enter Syria? Now we're going to shoot it down.
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:43.080]  That's a no fly zone. As a response to Obama and Hillary saying, we're going to start,
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:46.000]  you know, looking at shooting down aircraft. The Russians said, okay, let's get it going.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.600]  I mean, this is just over the top insanity. Well, it's not only that. Where does Obama
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:55.360]  think his ESPN is going to go? There's a nuclear war. Well, I got news for you. It'll be where
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:26:00.120]  do you think the mainstream news is going to go? They'll be in bombed out, rubble platforms
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:06.720]  with no electricity looking disheveled and basically still preaching from their scripts
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:12.600]  when everything is gone. I mean, look, this is crazy. People have got to understand. You
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:18.000]  know, I think that you, you've got to recognize there's never been a time like this. There's
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.800]  never been so much voicing. And why is it happening now? Because we know they're getting
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:25.280]  ready for the economic collapse. We know all the forces are moving. Why are they
[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:31.000]  starting war with Russia now? Well, it covers up number one, it covers up their crimes.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.840]  Number two, it fulfills the thing that I think everybody's missing. The entire rearrangement
[02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:42.560]  of the highest command, the office, offices of the land, military civilian population,
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:49.160]  everybody, they have embraced Islam. Islam demands a world war in order to bring about
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:53.760]  the Mahdi and that's the Islamic and clearly they've made a deal with it with Islam. I
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:57.000]  guess there's a billion and a half of them. That's the new operating system. Is it so
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:01.360]  satanic? Have you seen the new video we released World Net Daily of them in Libya chopping
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:05.080]  up the bodies of soldiers and making people before they execute them eat it so they go
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:10.960]  to hell in a satanic ritual? Well, I haven't seen that, but I mean, we watched that member
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:14.840]  about six months ago, they were chopping up Christians and literally hanging their remains
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:19.520]  in the meat market. I think it was in Aleppo and then Obama and others celebrate this.
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:24.640]  So this is about the rituals. It is. And that's something that people have got to understand.
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:30.440]  This is ritual sacrifice of the planetary population. Look, I used to write about throw
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:36.160]  weight. This nuclear weapon could do this. The Russians have been building while we've
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:42.480]  been decreasing in order to facilitate the return of the Mahdi. You remember when Ahmadinejad
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:49.320]  made the statement, if it was necessary, or 30 million Iranians to die and go out as martyrs
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:56.480]  to bring upon the return of the Mahdi, it would be acceptable to Allah. Well, guess what?
[02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:01.560]  He left office pretty much after that because maybe more Muslims than he could imagine didn't
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:05.800]  want to go that way. But here's the thing, Jeremiah the prophet, one of them who called
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:11.160]  evil good and good evil. You, Alex, I, all of the people have been fighting this battle
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:16.320]  every single talk show host talking about what's going on. Anybody criticizing New World
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:21.760]  Order? You go on and on and on. Constitutionals, Christians, anti-vaccine people, you're all
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:27.760]  considered terrorists. Now, what does a terrorist mean? These guys have redefined every single
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:34.000]  word and they have basically everything that applies to them. They overwhelm the census.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.160]  They overwhelm the mainstream. They're the races they call Donald Trump races. So what
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:42.960]  point in history are we right now? I believe we're at the point that outside of the grace
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:48.840]  of God that we're going to see a limited nuclear exchange. And here's what people don't get.
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:53.040]  The United States can disappear. Misery, Babylon, people fight about that. The United States
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:57.080]  can disappear and the rest of the world can come under the rule and reign of Antichrist.
[02:28:57.080 --> 02:29:01.480]  Exactly. Let me expand on this. When you watch, we're going to break the body language of
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:05.520]  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or Army Chief of Staff, General Mark Milley.
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:09.280]  They look freaked out. I mean, they look like they're looking at Congress and they're saying,
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:13.040]  okay, we're ready for war. We're being told to go to war. And then the adjunct guy behind
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:18.040]  him is like smiling and nodding like you guys want a war. They're saying to the globalist,
[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:23.160]  okay, you want a war. Why don't we let this little Nazi collaborator Soros even walk around
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:27.800]  outside prison? Why the hell does he get to have a nuclear war so he can be the Messiah?
[02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:34.960]  Well, he's the man that is going to basically be the facilitator. Remember this. These guys
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:39.080]  are all satanic puppets. Oh, I know. He said he believes he's the Messiah. Exactly. He
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:43.480]  wants to bring in the Antichrist. Look, it's totally clear. Let us talk about that. What
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:47.040]  happens if they're able to have their nuclear war at this time? I know all the trendies
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:52.680]  are going to like it. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[02:29:52.680 --> 02:30:02.960]  GCN Radio Network. Coming to a city near you, ISIS serial killers. That's right. An ISIS
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:08.880]  magazine, Rumiah, is recruiting serial killers to carry out knife attacks in the West. This
[02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:13.400]  hate group or religion of peace, according to Hillary Clinton, explains to potential
[02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:18.480]  recruits how they don't need a gun to terrorize innocent people. They just need a knife. This
[02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:24.200]  same publication also calls for its servants to shed blood and even to die for their cause.
[02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:28.920]  How would you describe that? Radical Islam? I'm sure Barack Obama will be ignoring this
[02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:32.800]  because radical Islam doesn't exist to him. I'm sure Hillary Clinton will turn a blind
[02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:37.320]  eye to this as well, as she doesn't want to offend anyone on the eve of an election.
[02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:41.800]  Here's a crazy idea. Find out whoever is publishing this mass murderer-producing hate
[02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:46.520]  rag and start questioning him and his entire staff. It's okay to assume it's a man as
[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:51.040]  they're in charge of women in radical Islam. Then jail him or start getting some answers
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:56.480]  on ISIS leaders immediately. Or are we really that incompetent? This is Owen Schreuer from
[02:30:56.480 --> 02:31:02.800]  Infowars.com. More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what
[02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:07.560]  has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for
[02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:12.480]  decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started
[02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:17.400]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into
[02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:21.960]  the water. They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the
[02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:26.760]  Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how
[02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:32.560]  to prepare yourself and your family. Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:37.960]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying
[02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:42.680]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for
[02:31:42.680 --> 02:31:47.040]  yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in
[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:53.920]  my view, to any optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfowarsLife.com

[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:39.520]  minutes. I appreciate Chris and Steve and Tim and Cindy and August for holding. We're
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:42.120]  going to go right to you and talk about the debates. What do you think Trump ought to do?
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:45.960]  What else is happening? I want to explain something. The Russians are having national
[02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:49.920]  TV shows saying we don't want nuclear war. Please stop moving weapons up our borders.
[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:53.680]  Please stop funding jihadis. Please stop these huge sanctions on us. Russia is down
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:57.560]  in depression, basically. I'm not lionizing Russia. They got their own problems, but they
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:01.400]  pay people to have kids. They're bringing Christianity back. They're saying you're not
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:04.400]  going to teach five-year-olds how to be gay. We're not against gay people. They're just
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:09.240]  like, you're not going to push this anti-human depopulation agenda. That's why the global
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:15.120]  is pushing. People don't have kids. That's all declassified as well. But when you watch
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:22.040]  these U.S. generals, and I've been on air for 21 years, okay, I've never seen body language
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:28.800]  or statements like these, we're not the ones saying nuclear war is inevitable. Generals
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:35.000]  are in Congress saying, and the Congressmen say, why can't we just use missiles and bomb
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:40.840]  their airfields and blow their planes up, and then we don't lose anybody? Like the Russians
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:45.280]  don't respond. There's a level of ignorance, like I said yesterday. Well, look at the Congressman
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:51.520]  who's still in from Georgia, who thinks the islands float. There's such a, from the entertainment
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:56.920]  and the movies and everything. People, even in government, and folks I talked to that
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:01.040]  are even, quote, pretty smart, are like brain damage now. It's like some spirit of like,
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:06.960]  they're sleeping. They're not awake. And they're sleepwalking over the edge of a cliff. I mean,
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:11.160]  since when did our government openly fund Al Qaeda and ISIS and overthrow our allies
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:16.520]  and murder everybody and, and, you know, lie and have child actors and fake TV shows with
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:23.400]  Hillary and just the level, the tripling, the quadrupling, the, the deception, the opening
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:28.360]  the borders and bringing people in with leprosy and TV and bubonic plague and the border patrol
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:33.520]  comes on the show. They're so desperate and says, yeah, the head of the border patrol
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:37.400]  in Texas was on came on. I was like, yeah, no, we're not even testing them. It looks
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:41.800]  like they have cholera or whatever. We just let them in. They're like, we don't know what's
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:45.160]  going on. It's crazy. I mean, you're like, well, don't be racist. Well, at least give
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:50.240]  them treatment. Don't put them in school with your kids to get it. I mean, it seems like
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:53.160]  a great delusions come. We're gonna go back to Steve Cuell and your phone calls here in
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:58.640]  just a moment. But man, I mean, our guests, they get ready for Deutsche Bank to go over
[02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:01.480]  and when it goes on, about the end of the year, then it triggers the next crisis and
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:05.400]  now they're getting saying, get ready. And it's like, I don't like being right. I don't
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:09.920]  like this. And I also don't like the fact that if there is a nuclear war, and we're here
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:15.520]  in a year from now, and North Korea has it nuked, you know, Seoul or Tokyo, which they
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:19.800]  threaten to do on a weekly basis. And the Clintons gave them the reactors to be able
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:24.040]  to have the fissile material. That's what I mean. I mean, I know the facts. I see evil
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:29.600]  people pushing in our government to the destruction of the planet. And it makes me mad. And then
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:34.200]  it makes me mad that generals are saying, we're on the edge of war with Russia. This is dangerous.
[02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:40.800]  We should have a serious discussion. And they go, not general, I don't get that. I said,
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:45.320]  we fire missiles at them. And none of our policy get hurt. They go, excuse me, sir,
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:50.400]  they'll retaliate. Well, I just don't get that. It's like there's some blindness where
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:55.680]  I guess they just think they water into the capital. I got a suit and a Cadillac and they
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:04.120]  won't fight back. I mean, you know, it's like a living in an insane asylum. And then they
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.960]  say, I'm crazy. We're going back to Steve Quill, Steve Quill.com here in just a moment.
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:13.400]  We carry his latest documentary film of that part one and part two. He exposes the Vatican
[02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:17.400]  in part two. It's when I anti-Catholic folks were anti what's taking it over. It's taking
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:20.960]  everything else over to, I mean, just look at it. His new film available there. We have
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:25.040]  American also available breaking down, you know, one of these global takeovers of America
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:31.560]  from a fictional account, but true legends, unholy see available at info wars store.com

[02:37:56.280 --> 02:38:00.480]  obviously it's integral for that. It's just needed for good health info wars life.com
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:06.920]  or call toll free 888-2533-139. But I'll be honest with people. I've gone from saying
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:10.840]  I think that there is a possibility of a nuclear war and total financial collapse either or
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:20.240]  or both to a prior to a probability to a certainty of at least global meltdown and a good chance
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:24.080]  of nuclear war or limited exchanges because when you have the Pentagon going, we can survive
[02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:28.680]  a first strike or maybe nuclear weapons aren't a big deal to use after all. And you've got
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:32.560]  all this talk, people saying, so what if nuclear reactors are leaking now? No need to clean
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:35.520]  it up. It's like they've already decided they're going to radiate the earth and maybe they've
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:38.840]  got some classified system they can remove radiation with. But we know the public's
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:43.080]  not getting it. I mean, I'm seeing crazy eyed behavior. Steve, well, I want to go to calls
[02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:46.960]  here across the board. He was a great talk show host and I don't handle any question.
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:50.520]  But what do you make of the what I just laid out, sir?
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:55.960]  Well, I would agree with you, Alex, 100%, but even go maybe another 100%. I'm going
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:04.440]  to up you 100%. There is too much posturing place in a military equipment out of the theater
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:10.160]  of any type of a drill taking place all over the world. And from the guys who are in the
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:16.280]  world of communications and military communications who know all this stuff, you know, they want
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:20.360]  to know the frequencies. They want to know who's doing it. Well, let me tell you this.
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:26.200]  When people are picking up all over the hands and shortwave operators around the world,
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:32.760]  such nervousness that even in authentication codes, people are screwing up and the command
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:38.440]  has to come on and say, you know, that's not correct. Correcting. I mean, people don't
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:43.320]  get the pucker factor off the charts because it's let's be clear, let's be clear. There's
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:48.320]  there's massive increases in backup systems because they're preparing for the internet
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:53.200]  and power to go dark and then they're preparing to go to Morse code codes and the whole backup
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:58.320]  systems, the deep earth, uh, you know, transmission systems, ultra low frequency to submarines.
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.400]  You name it. Yeah, everything. But here's something that people don't understand that
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:07.360]  daily mail carried a story three days ago. You probably saw it that GPS satellites are
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:11.840]  having problems. Oh yeah, a whole bunch of satellites have gone out. They don't know
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:15.640]  why you said last time you were on the Chinese were getting ready to attack our satellites.
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:20.480]  I forgot you said that. Yup. And here's the thing. That's a fat weaponry and I thought
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:26.480]  of like weaponry. That's another, that is the preliminary event that takes place. What
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:31.360]  did that force our military do? Put up a bunch of high altitude, uh, balloon 60 interesting
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:36.840]  66,000 feet to bounce signals off balloons. You mentioned it or our ultra low frequency
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:44.840]  that communicates with subs. All of our communications are based on the ability to transmit and receive.
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:49.480]  I'll tell you one thing that's interesting when Henry Grover had his vision, a guy that's
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:54.960]  probably got the most accurate vision when God showed him Russia attacking the United
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:41:00.640]  States. Now, this was two decades ago. Okay. The thing that he was showing is that all
[02:41:00.640 --> 02:41:07.200]  the radio towers, all the communication within our military was failing and we could not
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:11.600]  get our lunches, lunches off. By the way, here's the most serious thing. I want to address
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:17.680]  some of the trolls out there. Just to say this, you are absolutely stuck in normalcy
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:26.720]  bias. You do not move as much material state of the art frontline equipment to areas, especially
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:31.520]  on the border of NATO and especially off the coast. We got so many boomers. That's nuclear
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:37.040]  submarines from China, Russia hours. Everybody's out there and Alex again, all it takes is
[02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:43.280]  somebody bumping in, but there's never been anything like this. That's why I'm beyond
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:51.040]  the position of now, I think it's a possibility. No, I am saying this. It is now a definite
[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:58.360]  time to know that whoever blinks first or blinks last is going, whoever fires first
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:41:59.360]  is going to win.
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:02.960]  Let's be clear. This is all because Russia doesn't want to be encircled and have jihadists
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:08.720]  turn loose. Four years ago, our military, it's now been declassified. It's been leaked.
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:11.800]  Cy Hirsch came here and confirmed it earlier this year that we were right with our sources,
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:15.560]  which is a big hat tip. It's a Pulitzer Prize winner, folks. He doesn't think info
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:18.840]  wars is cookie. He came on and said, no, you're right. The military basically had a soft
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:23.920]  coup against Obama and said, no, the problem is he fired them all, put them all new ones
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:27.600]  in that'll do it and notice the generals that were in there before they go and they work
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:33.000]  for Trump. And they're the ones saying, stop World War III. We got to take America back.
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.600]  They're trying to start a war with Russia and they're behind the jihadists. It's not
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:40.600]  that General Flynn is a Russian agent. He successfully fought the Russians and defeated
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:44.280]  them in the Cold War. He understands that this is an evil plan.
[02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:51.480]  Well, and that's an evil thought and evil plan. That's even a biblical word. Okay. An
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:52.480]  evil plan.
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:58.880]  So here's where we're at. I'm telling people, watch what goes on in the embassies. Okay.
[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:04.920]  Watch the rhetoric increase. Watch it direct, not indirect, but direct announcements from
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:11.160]  Putin. I guess he's going to make, in my opinion, he will make two, possibly three direct announcements.
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:15.520]  He's going to the UN to say, stop this madness.
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:20.200]  By the way, a huge Russian flag on Unveiled Putin on it on the New York Ridge by the UN
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:23.480]  today saying, peacemaker. So that's obviously a message.
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:29.080]  Right. And so what we're going to see here, and this is something that is astonishing
[02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:35.960]  to me. I just want to read my response, Alex. It's a one sentence response to somebody who's
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:42.440]  named Tomb or something. Russia has drills every year. And now listen, my response, not
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:47.680]  with 40 million evacuated and all the prepositioning of Russian military assets out of their exercise
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:53.160]  area. My answer, your denial will kill you. You are frightened and hiding behind normalcy
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:59.600]  bias, normalcy bias, dumb unto death. You know, when I coined that term, people got offended.
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:04.200]  Well, I'd rather offend them and provoke them to really take a hard look.
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:07.720]  Well, Putin a year ago said to the media, he said, why can't I get it through to you
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.040]  that this is moving towards nuclear war? What is wrong with you people? How do I get you
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:12.920]  to snap out of it?
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:18.960]  Absolutely. But see, can I tell you something? You look at Russia and you look at the determination
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:27.880]  in World War II. You say one word, Stalingrad. You look at what is absolutely a fact of history.
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:33.520]  You know, you can't go in and take Russia. And if our highest technology, you know, stuff
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:40.040]  that most people don't even know exists, TR3s, TR3 Bravo's, all the stuff that's so advanced.
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:47.160]  But remember this, no matter what technology is put into play, there is always counter-technology.
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:48.160]  We used to think that...
[02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:50.840]  Well, how does it affect the globalists? We know they got a program to go completely
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:55.840]  automated and autonomous, saying, cut humans out. Our military, 99... I mean, they hate
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:45:00.120]  Obama. They hate Hillary. They know the program. How does that affect this?
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:05.040]  Well, first of all, they're going to be sacrificed, okay? Now look at this. Look at all the cut-off
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:09.080]  of funds in the military and then look at all the build-up of funds internally in this
[02:45:09.080 --> 02:45:13.680]  country. Look at all the United Nations. Look, it takes money to bring in foreign soldiers.
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:14.680]  I actually...
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:17.600]  And by the way, look at... I never used to actually think U.N. troops. But now it's
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:21.760]  like the U.N. will run our elections. The U.N. will run our police. The U.N. will do
[02:45:21.760 --> 02:45:26.480]  black reparations, literally with indigenous groups inside trying to stir up rebellion.
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:30.960]  This really is probing for a takeover. I mean, I've studied military history. This is like
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:33.560]  we're living in a freaking science fiction movie, Steve.
[02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:34.560]  Absolutely.
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:35.560]  But...
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:39.040]  I get it. They took the Russians into hitting us. What about false flagging and saying the
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:40.040]  Russians did it?
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:45.120]  Well, I wouldn't put it past that. You've detailed in all your videos and all the different
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:52.640]  amounts of shows you've done on this. False flags are a normal, proceeding event to take
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:53.640]  place...
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:58.400]  Sure. Well, what needs to happen is, George Soros, Obama-Hillary, we've got to have what's
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:01.760]  ever left of the government. They've got to be stopped now. I mean, Hillary's totally
[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:05.680]  above the law. They're butchering everything. The borders are wide open, Steve. And I'm
[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:09.200]  not a guy that wants to have some fight or a civil war, but somebody's going to have
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.800]  to stop them before they start World War III.
[02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:15.960]  Well, and I believe the only one capable of doing that right now, seriously, Alex, is
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:21.040]  you know his God, okay? And I believe that God wants his people, those who believe in
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:22.040]  him, underneath him...
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:26.200]  Hey, I'll be honest. I'm almost ready to back my kids up and get out to the country. I mean,
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:27.680]  you know, I mean, it's just getting bad.
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:33.000]  Well, I would. And can I tell you something? Here's the point. Over the last three nights
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:37.080]  I've been up at all hours of morning, you know what it's like, posting stories, only
[02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:42.400]  to watch them take down my website. You know, I can't post some stories, but I want to
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:46.760]  share this. This is just coming in in real time. Russian foreign ministry says, Russia
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:52.760]  sees legal consequences. The secretary carries comments about Russian war crimes in Syria.
[02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:59.040]  Russian war crimes were the ones that have funded ISIS, al-Qaeda, everything you can
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:03.080]  do. And there's not a word against the Christians being butchered.
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:07.280]  This is all done on purpose to set us up in the world's eyes. None of it's on the US
[02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:11.720]  media. It's all over the world. The whole world knows that Trump comes out and says
[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:15.840]  that the hell he's a nut. I just, you know, I don't want this to happen, but I look at
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:20.000]  the average evil liberal trendy that hates everybody and thinks they know everything.
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:23.440]  You know, I wonder what they're going to think, you know, if they survive the nuke strike
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:26.240]  and everybody's starving to death. I mean, is it going to be funny then?
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:31.600]  Well, I think the bottom line is, is that they're going to have their Prozac meltdown.
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:35.360]  If you, and seriously, you know, you can't. You're right. You're right. The big bomb
[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:39.120]  is after the city's collapse. A week later, it is going to be Bedlam.
[02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:44.160]  Right. Bill Forschen wrote one second after and then he wrote one year after. Okay. Well,
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:50.640]  I can only say this. Can you imagine a bunch of people on Prozac who are in the matrix
[02:47:50.640 --> 02:47:54.520]  with their, whatever they're pressing, iPad, iPhone, I this, I that, and it all turns
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:48:00.120]  off. And it all turns off. And then the old Charles Bronson movie, Telephone, and I think
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:05.880]  they just made another movie equivalent to a Samuel Jackson, you know, the movie about
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:11.000]  he gives out free cell phones and everybody goes crazy. You remember when we talked, this
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:15.640]  is important for people to understand all those cell phone towers are not cell phone
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:21.400]  towers. They are absolutely loud. And by the way, DARPA DARPA in one Baltimore Sun article
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:26.520]  16 years ago admitted they were quote testing calming the public through cell phone tower
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:31.720]  frequencies. Absolutely. So what do they do? They take, they kick it in a certain frequency.
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:36.440]  Everybody goes to sleep. I believe that's what's been on. They turn it the other direction. Everybody
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:41.240]  goes to everybody's throat. So here's what I want to do. And we'll take all the, you know,
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:47.800]  phone calls you want to give, but people have got to recognize that this is the globalist plan.
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:51.640]  Well, by the way, what you're saying is over the top, but I have the chairman joint chiefs.
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:56.040]  I have the head of the army. I have all these top Russian generals. I have Putin 40 million
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:49:00.360]  people, new drills saying we're on the edge of war. I have Congress going, why don't you just
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:06.920]  blow these Russians up? And they go, uh, they've been invited into Syria. So we've been told not
[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:10.680]  to aid them anymore, but we're not going to attack them unless you want to go to war. And the general
[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:13.800]  looks at them like he's crazy. What is, let me ask you this, we're going to break them back with
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:17.320]  calls. I promise cause I'm going to write to your troopers. Everybody that called in, I hate to
[02:49:17.320 --> 02:49:21.160]  do this to John. It's a big asshole. It's a free Hillary for present shirt or bottle of
[02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:24.360]  coital silver for holding so long. I appreciate you. I apologize. I made you hold so long.
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:29.080]  Steve, let me ask you this question. It seems like a great delusion. Like even people I talk to
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:33.000]  that are in government or even executives now, they seem like they're not awake or they're like
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:37.480]  retarded now. Like something like their soul's gone. People are noticing this everywhere. Like
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:43.480]  either you're more awake or people are like zombies now. Well, absolutely. And, and we talked about
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:48.200]  there's so much technology out there for mind control. Look at DARPA brain. Okay. Well, there's
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:51.320]  all this mind control. They admit they haven't. I've had, you know, Dr. Beggar John, like you
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:57.160]  have all the patents. Well, why are we able to do this? Because, because when you have a hunger
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:02.440]  for truth, they had a hunger and thirst after righteousness, you know, God promises us that
[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:08.120]  we'll have what we seek for. When you believe a lie, Alex, it cuts you off. Now look, we've got,
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:15.000]  we've got, uh, exactly. It's a virus. Once you believe the one lie, it domino effects. Absolutely.
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:21.960]  And, and people don't yet understand the full effects about what I would call, uh, subatomic
[02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:27.160]  vibrations. And you know, all the stories coming about the, about how much storage you can put in
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:34.920]  a strand of DNA and even in water molecules, bigger than anything that the NSA has, or they
[02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:39.240]  probably have. Exactly. Every cell is a thousand times more complex than what the globalists have
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:43.720]  built. They think they're God. Stay there. I promise, Chris, you're up first, then Tim,
[02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:48.520]  then Steve, then Cindy, then August. We got two steves. Stay with us. We'll be back. I'm going to
[02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:52.360]  go a little bit in the next hour as well. Then David Knight's coming up. We got a lot more
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:56.680]  info wars.com. We have to admit how bad things are to be able to turn this around.
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:02.360]  Dad, I'm watching the polls and I'm worried. What if Hillary wins the election? What if
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:06.200]  Trump wins the election? Well, let me tell you, son, no matter what happens with the election,
[02:51:06.200 --> 02:51:10.200]  you need to protect your retirement. It's up to you to take control and manage your future.
[02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:14.920]  And the simplest and easiest way to do that is with a private storage, gold, silver, IRA.
[02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:19.560]  A private storage, gold, silver, IRA. Really? That's right. We set up our own private
[02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:23.640]  storage IRA with a gold, silver group. And now we have full control of our retirement.
[02:51:23.640 --> 02:51:30.120]  And the bonus we qualified for $995 in free silver. Gold is up over 20% silver over 30%.
[02:51:30.120 --> 02:51:35.400]  On the Dow, only up about 7%. Trust me, now's the time to diversify with gold and silver.

[02:54:00.520 --> 02:54:06.680]  Bollgrad is the name of what Stalin grad got turned to, and I always mixed the two up with
[02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:10.920]  Lenin grads, and they got its name changed back to St. Petersburg, but the big battle was in
[02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:15.400]  Stalin grad. I mean, you see that in any of the World War II documentaries, but I get all these
[02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:20.600]  names and words scrambled. The point is that the globalists want to take over sovereign nations,
[02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:26.520]  world governments falling apart. And you know, to hear Army Chief of Staff Mike Milley say,
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:30.680]  we've got Russia trying to pull out of this, and the EU trying to pull out, and we've got the UK
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:36.040]  Brexit, this will not be tolerated. I mean, he really shows himself to be up there, this whole
[02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:41.560]  world government enchilada that we don't want to be under, bro. The anti-family EU with 100%
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:49.080]  taxes in France. Wow, so this guy came off as pretty darn evil. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:53.000]  came off like, hey, you want a war? You know, this is what you're asking for as more sane.
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.960]  I want to go to your phone calls. We'll do a little bit more in the next hour, back on the
[02:54:55.960 --> 02:55:00.120]  subject. I know you're all over the map with the callers. Folks would talk about Trump and
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:05.960]  globalism. That's a perfect segue why they hate Trump so much. He wants to end this doomsday
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:10.760]  situation that we're going down. I mean, he's mainly advised by General Flynn who exposed
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:15.720]  our government running Al Qaeda and ISIS. Trump is amazing, folks, just for that alone.
[02:55:15.720 --> 02:55:19.720]  Chris and Georgia, you're on the air with SteveQuel, SteveQuel.com. Join us this Sunday,
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:23.720]  4 to 6 p.m., right through 10 o'clock with our debate coverage in FullWars.com, forward slash
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:29.080]  show. Go ahead, Chris. Yes, hello, Alice. It is a pleasure to talk and speak with you today.
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:34.120]  You too, brother. Go ahead. Yes, I'm an LGBT transporter. I have to say, Alice, being in
[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:39.000]  high school, it is a living hell supporting Trump and being an LGBT. I have three points for you.
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:46.040]  One is, what if Trump gets too hardcore in debates, so hardcore that they can't even cope with it?
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:50.920]  What do you think will happen? Will they fake something? Also, no doubt, we know the New
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:56.440]  World Order will fall. But if he wins and they say that the election fraud took place and tells
[02:55:56.440 --> 02:56:01.320]  how the results of what will happen in about Russia, Howard, are you about nuclear weapons
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:05.000]  being used and how possible is it? Well, sure, we've been talking. Those are all great questions.
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:09.240]  Let me ask Steve Quill this. It kind of composes what you just said. Why are they so afraid of
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:14.200]  Trump? And what would you say if you were Trump in the debate, Steve Quill? I would go for Hillary's
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:20.520]  throat. He was too passive. The bottom line, he's got to stick to the things from Fast & Furious,
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:27.240]  Benghazi. He's got to stick to emails. He's got to stick to IRS persecution, the Clinton
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:33.240]  Blood scandal, destabilization, the killing of Momar Gaddafi, the killing of, you know, look,
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:39.320]  he has hoared out this country. You cannot raise billions of dollars and there's lists on the
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:45.800]  Internet. Who contributed to this? Who contributed to that? And the hypocrisy of it all is astounding.
[02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:50.040]  When you look at the FBI, the Department of Justice, those who are charged, listen, Alex,
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:56.920]  we are in what the Bible calls a time of lawlessness. They call it the mystery of iniquity.
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:00.760]  Yeah, you think of lawlessness as maybe some guy drunk on the street, okay, and people partying
[02:57:00.760 --> 02:57:04.440]  on New Year's. Real lawlessness is when the courts are totally corrupt and the supposed
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:09.080]  investigators have been bought off. Absolutely. And when we're dealing with the whole thing,
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:13.240]  when the head of the FBI, it's got to be problematic for the men in the FBI, because
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:17.720]  there's good men in the FBI, just like there's good men in the government. But like the Border
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:21.400]  Patrol guy. By the way, I agree with you. I'm shocked by the most awake people in the Federal
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:24.520]  Government are like Border Patrol, FBI, you name it. That's why I'm saying we don't do a civil
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:30.600]  war with them. The evil is on top. So what do we do? Well, here's what we do. We have to get
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:38.200]  people absolutely, not only voting, but they have to challenge the mainstream media. They have to
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:41.560]  challenge... I agree. What do you think of the folks going out screaming, Bill Clinton's a rapist on
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:47.320]  TV? Well, I think it's accurate. Look at what they're doing to Bill Cosby, not to excuse him.
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:52.920]  No, but what he did was, I mean, picking up bunny girls, you know, at topless bars and they claim
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:57.080]  he gave him a drug. Okay, maybe he did. He's bad. Throw him in prison. Bill Clinton rapes the hell and
[02:57:57.080 --> 02:58:02.280]  beats women. Absolutely. And, you know, look, you got eyewitness testimony. The woman that sleeps
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:08.520]  with a man of Clinton's power and, you know, sexual appetite is going to hear a lot of things. It's
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:14.120]  like when Jennifer Flowers wrote her book and when Broderick and look in the mouth of two or three
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:19.320]  witnesses, these... He has settled cases. Stay there. We're going to break. Chris, thank you. Great
[02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:23.720]  points. Right when we come back with Steve Quill, always on fire, more than ever. It was a
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:30.440]  world so crazy. Stay where this recalls from. Each Friday, October 7th, 2016, only 31 days

[03:00:15.400 --> 03:00:19.640]  We shell his latest book and films at InfoWarsShore.com. They're very, very thought-provoking.
[03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:23.320]  I wanted to get through these calls because I want to ask Steve about, again, I hate to
[03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:27.720]  center and kiss his butt. It's just that I'll be honest and I've said this. He's got to be
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:30.920]  quiet, so I'm going to call him. But, I mean, I would have had him on because he was so interesting
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:34.360]  and I liked him. I knew a lot of stuff he said was true 20 years ago. He was one of the first
[03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:38.120]  guests out on radio 21 years ago. He was a nice guy. He'd come on, you know, routinely.
[03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:42.440]  That's four or five times. He goes, look, kid, you keep questioning what I'm saying. Just read my
[03:00:42.440 --> 03:00:46.520]  book. I can come on, but not every week. I'll see you later. And he was talking about Kim
[03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:49.640]  trailing, geoengineering, all this stuff. And I thought, this is crazy. And he gets into this
[03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:54.120]  stuff today, I think, over the top, just because I haven't seen it myself. But I'm just sitting
[03:00:54.120 --> 03:00:58.440]  here thinking about all the things he talked about so long ago and how the elite believe
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:02.600]  there's another dimension and how they want to create a whole other dimension and force us into
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:06.840]  a matrix. And then a few years later, documents came out saying that. And now all the big
[03:01:06.840 --> 03:01:10.840]  billionaires, I mean, they're just all over the place saying, Oh, this is a false dimension.
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:15.480]  An evil God is controlling us. We're going to build a new dimension and break out of it.
[03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:19.400]  And top scientists are working around the clock. This is exactly what you said 20 years ago.
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:23.880]  They want to break into a dimension and escape with stargates. And I'm like, Steve,
[03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:29.160]  don't talk about that on my show. Now they're on the news every night. Where did you get all this
[03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:38.120]  stuff? The Bible and from I believe the inspiration. Look, here's the thing. You know, as a Bible
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:43.240]  believing Christian, all you have to do is read the book of Revelation, the book of Daniel,
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:48.920]  Isaiah, Ezekiel, from the prophets to understand what would be in there. But I made it a habit,
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:54.760]  Alex, to pray and seek God. And look, here's the thing. We're watching the foundations of this
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:58.520]  country. They're destroyed. What it says is what can the righteous do? And that's what
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:05.000]  your frustration, my frustration and all of our frustration is, is what can we do when the wicked
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:10.120]  rule the righteous mourn? That's the spirit of heaviness. George Norrie asked me that. He said,
[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:14.040]  man, there's this feeling. You may have listened to it if he didn't, but I was on the other night
[03:02:14.040 --> 03:02:18.040]  and I said, look, there's a spirit of heaviness. I feel it every day. It is incredibly heavy to
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:22.440]  know this. Yeah. Yeah. So and then you don't want to admit it to yourself, but you know, you've got
[03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:29.400]  to be honest about it. Right. And there's too much dishonesty. Listen, let's make it easy.
[03:02:29.400 --> 03:02:35.880]  The Bible declares that pretty much a third and a third of the population is going to be destroyed.
[03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:40.600]  You do the math. It's about half the population. We talk about the Georgia guide stones. We can
[03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:45.960]  quote Prince Philip Cousteau. We can quote all of the old guys that are dead now, what they want to
[03:02:45.960 --> 03:02:51.480]  do. Sorrows this planet, everything. Ask yourself this, who protects George Sorrows? Here's what
[03:02:51.480 --> 03:02:56.680]  I'm praying. I think this could make a difference. I'm praying that the war that's gone on in Russia,
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:02:59.800]  whether they're going to release everything they know about Hillary and Obama,
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:06.760]  at least they would have presented the truth. And I think the world, once Russia were to do that,
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:12.040]  and by the way, Alex, they've openly talked about that. Remember, will Russia release all of the,
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:16.440]  you know, formerly KGB files now? There's a whole bunch of foreign governments have all of Hillary's
[03:03:16.440 --> 03:03:20.920]  emails. They have them. Why haven't they released them? Well, they won't release them yet because
[03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:25.720]  Trump has even come out and said, Russia, please release them. Right. And well, here's the deal.
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:32.040]  There will come a point, that may be a signal marker too. It behooves the Russians to cover
[03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:37.800]  the traders that have sold us out to them. But when the Russians find out that the traders have
[03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:43.800]  sold them out to the New World Order and Putin's got a long memory. Now look, I'm not a Russophile,
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:45.960]  but what I'm saying is- No, no, the Russians have a lot of corruption. They've
[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:49.240]  impertrated our government. Hillary's involved. Exactly. That's why they're so freaked out.
[03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:52.920]  Hillary, we've given you hundreds of millions of dollars that we know, probably billions.
[03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:57.000]  You sold your country out to us partially. Why are you starting a war with us? That's why
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:02.840]  they're so freaked out because she's a mad dog. I think the answer is the house divided can stand.
[03:04:02.840 --> 03:04:08.520]  Listen, it's a matter of double cross, quadruple cross, and octa cross, okay? In other words,
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:15.480]  everybody is going to fight for their power. Everyone's so Machiavelli that they lose the
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:19.240]  narrative and then just are actually mental midgets because they don't just have honor and do the
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:24.360]  right thing. But look, you can go on the front page of Matt Grudge's website, Grudge Report,
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:29.560]  and look at how many weird people are coming. The demons are loose. That's why Tom Horn and I
[03:04:29.560 --> 03:04:34.680]  write about stargates. That's why, and Alex, you're selling the DVD, The Unholy Sea,
[03:04:34.680 --> 03:04:39.560]  that people have got to get that. It's like a roadmap. You just went through a litany of stuff
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:44.120]  I've been right about, you know, and I think it's important that people get that DVD from
[03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:48.200]  Implewar's store. Sure, well, here's the deal. Even if you're not right about everything or I'm not
[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:51.880]  right about anything, the elite believe what you're saying. They're just on the other side. They are,
[03:04:51.880 --> 03:04:56.120]  this is, this is, we're living in a science fiction movie. Tim, you're straight ahead, so is Stephen
[03:04:56.120 --> 03:05:02.920]  and others. Stay with us. Drug Raid. 81-year-old Margaret Holcomb was minding her own business
[03:05:02.920 --> 03:05:07.960]  in her humble home with her son when all of a sudden she was part of a full-blown drug raid.
[03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:13.800]  This wasn't a wrongful raid on an incorrect address, as we've seen in the past. No, no,
[03:05:13.800 --> 03:05:20.040]  they caught a fish with this one. Literally, one fish. After all, Margaret had one marijuana plant
[03:05:20.040 --> 03:05:25.960]  growing in her backyard garden. Get the choppers! Get the National Guard! Take this woman down!
[03:05:27.160 --> 03:05:32.040]  The joint raid between the National Guard and the Massachusetts State Police, which also included a
[03:05:32.040 --> 03:05:39.000]  military helicopter, was successful and they were able to take down the one marijuana plant. A job
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:45.080]  well done, boys. Now, Margaret will have to find a nice legal pharmaceutical to ease her arthritis
[03:05:45.080 --> 03:05:51.160]  and glaucoma. Now, does the war on drugs make sense to you? This is Owen Schreuer from Infowars.com.

[03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:10.120]  It's Friday, October 7th, 2016. We are now only 31 days from the historic election.
[03:08:10.120 --> 03:08:19.640]  This is the Alex Jones Show. Alex Jones. Trump and the future versus Hillary and the establishment
[03:08:19.640 --> 03:08:26.040]  this Sunday, 4 to 10. So do the math. That's six hours. We're going to be on air at least
[03:08:26.680 --> 03:08:30.520]  for three, four hours before the debate, during the debate, and post-debate coverage with myself
[03:08:30.520 --> 03:08:36.520]  and the rest of the team. So not just the Sunday Show 4 to 6, but now 4 to 10 p.m. coming up this
[03:08:36.520 --> 03:08:41.320]  Sunday. Briefly before I go back to Steve Cuellon, a few final calls. Here are four or five of the
[03:08:41.320 --> 03:08:49.080]  winners. Terrence O'Hagan, $2,000. Let me sign that. That's going to be put in the mail. Joseph
[03:08:50.120 --> 03:08:56.360]  Baldkovic, I'll pronounce that right. $5,000. This is for the confronting the Clintons and
[03:08:56.360 --> 03:09:02.440]  getting the word out that they're sexual predators. Bill is. Micah Phemia, I've pronounced that right.
[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:11.720]  So congratulations. Richard Garrett, $2,000. Congratulations. Peter Miller, $2,000. There's
[03:09:11.720 --> 03:09:17.000]  a lot of folks either got the image up or didn't get it out on national TV that a lot of you did.
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:24.600]  So we've got three $2,000 winners and two and one $5,000 winner. I may have to redo this,
[03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:27.560]  because I think a couple of these were going to be $5,000. I must have misspoke to them.
[03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:30.520]  I think I have to redo these. I think some people are getting $5,000. I think I had three
[03:09:30.520 --> 03:09:36.280]  of that were $5,000, two that were $2,000, but whatever. They don't want me to show real checks
[03:09:36.280 --> 03:09:39.320]  on there anyway. So these are symbolic. I'll just tell you, I can't do anything fake,
[03:09:39.320 --> 03:09:42.840]  like a Hillary fake press conference. So I'm going to redo the checks after the show anyways.
[03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:47.640]  So we'll go back over that. Nobody's fault. I just babble during the breaks, giving orders to
[03:09:47.640 --> 03:09:51.560]  people and then, you know, don't get some of this stuff straight. Steve Quills, our guest.
[03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:55.560]  Let's go ahead and go to Tim in California. You're on the air. Welcome.
[03:09:55.560 --> 03:09:59.000]  Hey, Alex. Welcome, my friend.
[03:10:00.680 --> 03:10:03.160]  Hey, I'd just like to go ahead and first of all, thank all the
[03:10:03.160 --> 03:10:06.760]  info wars listeners and your staff for doing a bang up job.
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:13.480]  They're always on top of things. I'd like to go ahead and say about Donald Trump. He needs to get
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:19.160]  out there on Sunday at this debate, and he needs to go for the regular, Alex. He really needs to
[03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:24.680]  knock this thing out of the park. He needs to put Hillary on her heels and, you know,
[03:10:24.680 --> 03:10:31.480]  end this once and for all. No, I agree with that. I agree with that, Tim. I mean, what's your gut
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:38.760]  level analysis of Trump, Steve? Well, I think he's been raised up literally to be the prosecuting
[03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:45.000]  attorney to show people the level of debauchery, treason, evil wickedness, go on and on and on.
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:51.160]  And then if we judge wrong, we go under judgment. Yeah. And then the simple fact is, Alex, is that,
[03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:58.200]  look, America has lived in the delusion. That's why, you know, whatever 50% of whatever can vote
[03:10:58.200 --> 03:11:05.000]  for Hillary, et cetera, the point is going beyond mind control. The same people that hate Donald
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:10.440]  Trump are the same people you and I have been speaking about for 25 and 21 years on the air.
[03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:15.480]  A man is known is known more by his enemies than by his friends. Just look at George Soros,
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:21.160]  the communist Chinese Soros, the evil Wahhabist. I mean, Mike, Trump's wonderful.
[03:11:21.880 --> 03:11:26.920]  And I got to tell you something again, now that now they're the feminists are taken on
[03:11:26.920 --> 03:11:34.280]  his daughter, you know, beautiful and brilliant for talking about how she basically loves being
[03:11:35.080 --> 03:11:40.280]  a mother in the most important job in the world. I mean, look, here's the thing, the communists,
[03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:44.200]  the communists, the pinkos. By the way, while she runs a business that she personally made over
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:49.640]  $300 million in and kept over $100 million. And so, you know, here's the thing.
[03:11:49.640 --> 03:11:52.200]  Let me tell you, a woman isn't obsessed with her kids or something wrong with her.
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:56.680]  Yeah. And also, the thing is, is look at, look at the rest of the world.
[03:11:56.680 --> 03:12:04.040]  The Muslim, the mullahs are saying that our women's wombs will be our conquering armor.
[03:12:04.040 --> 03:12:10.200]  Look at conquering, excuse me, army. And look at what's happening to American sperm count.
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:14.200]  Look at what's happening to the military. There was that picture you probably saw.
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:16.280]  We're under chemical attack. They're wearing red shoes.
[03:12:17.080 --> 03:12:20.840]  Yep. And the four transgenders, you know, here's the deal.
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:27.400]  Even the lesbian gay community should be furious at what happens with ISIS, man. They're throwing
[03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:31.480]  them off. But that's okay because it's liberal. It's part of the loving agenda. Tim, great points.
[03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:35.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Florida. You're on the air with Steve Quill.
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:43.160]  Yeah. Hey, good afternoon. You know, you guys have been talking about Trump and Hillary.
[03:12:43.720 --> 03:12:49.320]  And Alex, you said something the first hour in reference to Bill Clinton, you said, you pig.
[03:12:50.040 --> 03:12:55.160]  And then Steve said, Trump needs to go for the throne. And this last car study needs to go
[03:12:55.160 --> 03:13:01.080]  for the jugular. I want to give you what I believe is the perfect strategy for Trump
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:07.560]  in this coming debate. And it's two words. And this will resonate with you.
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:11.960]  Hog hunting. And here's what I'm getting at. A friend of mine years ago, I've never been
[03:13:11.960 --> 03:13:18.120]  hog hunting, but he told me the way he does it, and I've lived in Texas, is he has three dogs
[03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:24.600]  that he has trained to go after that hog. And by the way, Bill is the swine, but Hillary is the
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:30.520]  razorback. Okay. But here's the thing. He said he has three dogs to distract that hog.
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:35.960]  And then he comes around from behind with the blade and gets it right in the throat. So here's
[03:13:35.960 --> 03:13:41.240]  what Trump needs to do. He needs to bring out the three dogs. Number one, emails. Number two,
[03:13:41.240 --> 03:13:49.720]  Benghazi. Number three, Saudi support. And then the dagger, the handle is, let me remind you,
[03:13:49.720 --> 03:13:57.000]  in Beijing, China, Hillary went there in 93 to the UN conference on women. China is the most
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:14:02.200]  cutthroat nation other than the Saudis and the Islam as a whole when it comes to women
[03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:08.360]  with their one child per family policy, how they drug and they torture and they kill women over
[03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:15.320]  400 million deaths because of that policy. And then the blade is Hillary the enabler of her
[03:14:15.320 --> 03:14:20.680]  sexual psychopath husband Bill right in the throat. That will seal it for Trump.
[03:14:21.320 --> 03:14:25.720]  I agree. And he's got people in there advising him to play nice who are probably operatives
[03:14:25.720 --> 03:14:32.200]  or operatives. Alex, they're being paid to do that. I agree with the caller. It's absolutely
[03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:39.560]  imperative. Remember this, the way the liberals always work is to overwork, over, just run you
[03:14:39.560 --> 03:14:45.880]  with obscure stuff, stuff that keeps the fat coins a little bit exactly. You got it. And,
[03:14:45.880 --> 03:14:50.600]  you know, basically they want to have, they want to put. Hey, you know why they won't have me on
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:55.000]  national TV? Because I don't follow their script. I totally ignore them and take it over. Oh, yeah,
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:15:02.040]  I had a call. Yeah, I, and I've watched you and, you know, I have a certain Fox people call me and
[03:15:02.040 --> 03:15:07.720]  they say, we'd love to put you on, but our leadership and our, you know, management won't
[03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:11.720]  allow it. Of course not. That's the same. They want to allow Michael Savage on Michael Savage.
[03:15:11.720 --> 03:15:18.440]  You've had him on kudos for that. He's a brilliant, brilliant man. Trump better put him into his,
[03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:21.800]  Oh, it's going to take him completely off the air. We didn't shut up. So that's all
[03:15:21.800 --> 03:15:27.640]  of him going on. Very serious time. Great point, Steve. Both Steve in Florida and Steve out West,
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:31.480]  Steve Quayle. We're almost out of time here. August in Arizona. Go ahead.
[03:15:33.880 --> 03:15:35.880]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me? Yes, I can August. Thank you.
[03:15:36.920 --> 03:15:42.120]  I just wanted to say you guys are amazing. I love hearing, talk about the Lord. I love
[03:15:42.120 --> 03:15:47.960]  hearing about his space. I have some dots that I wanted to connect as quickly as possible for you.
[03:15:47.960 --> 03:15:53.080]  And I'll just go ahead and start. I'm kind of, I can't believe that you've, I've never heard
[03:15:53.080 --> 03:16:01.560]  you talk about Kathy O'Brien. Now, Kathy O'Brien is married to Mark Phillips. If you go on YouTube
[03:16:01.560 --> 03:16:08.680]  and you type in Kathy O'Brien with the C, X Illuminati Mind Control Victim and you go to
[03:16:08.680 --> 03:16:14.200]  I mean, I have interviewed her a few times more than 15 years ago. And my only issue is
[03:16:14.200 --> 03:16:18.600]  how, how do you prove it? There's not photos. There's not, I mean, I know the elite. I mean,
[03:16:18.600 --> 03:16:23.640]  no one cares about the Lolita Express and hundreds of little kids admittedly or the Catholic Church
[03:16:23.640 --> 03:16:29.640]  or Sandusky when it's proven. So kind of everybody just interviewed her thousands of times over and
[03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:33.800]  over again, you know, and she talks about being a mind control slave for sex. Well, that's been
[03:16:33.800 --> 03:16:38.280]  declassified, but the CIA did that. So I'm just like, okay, you know, it's kind of like, why
[03:16:38.280 --> 03:16:42.520]  don't I cover the fact that opium production skyrocketed when the US took over Afghanistan?
[03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:47.320]  It's admitted. I just don't know about her particular case. I mean, I know that goes on.
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:55.560]  Okay. Yeah, you know, I, if you do to the YouTube video and you go to one hour, nine minutes,
[03:16:55.560 --> 03:17:00.280]  10 seconds, you can hear her talk about how, um, Hillary did it that she didn't,
[03:17:00.920 --> 03:17:05.880]  she, uh, would like to take advantage of her and Bill didn't want to. And that actually Bill was
[03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:10.120]  more of a homosexual back in the seventies and that she testified to seeing him do that. But
[03:17:10.120 --> 03:17:14.440]  besides that, I wanted to, here's the deal, bro, bro, bro, here's the deal. I'm not saying she's
[03:17:14.440 --> 03:17:19.800]  full of prunes. There are schizophrenics online that claim they're married to me and then I raped
[03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:24.920]  them. Okay. I mean, there are people that claim I'm a seven foot lizard. So all I'm saying is no
[03:17:24.920 --> 03:17:31.000]  one ever wants to cover the admitted CIA program and real people or Dr. Ewing Cameron and thousands
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:35.720]  of kids that were kidnapped. That's on the discovery channel or history channel. They always
[03:17:35.720 --> 03:17:40.760]  just go to this person or that person and then this big list of things. And so I have to document
[03:17:40.760 --> 03:17:45.240]  things, but I appreciate your call. Uh, you want to get into Kathy O'Brien here, Steve? Well,
[03:17:46.040 --> 03:17:52.120]  I'll just say this. I, I, um, did that whole thing too. About 15 years ago and mind control
[03:17:52.120 --> 03:17:58.840]  is real. Sexual predators are real. You look at who, uh, Bill Clinton hung out with Epstein. You
[03:17:58.840 --> 03:18:03.160]  look at all this stuff, but here that's not, can I tell you something? It's not that it's
[03:18:03.160 --> 03:18:10.040]  whole news, but we're talking right now. And this isn't a rebuke. It's just a re statement of facts.
[03:18:10.040 --> 03:18:16.840]  We're talking about World War three fulfilling the globalist determined plan to take the population
[03:18:16.840 --> 03:18:22.200]  of the world down to 500 million. And by the way, that sounds crazy, but our top generals and their
[03:18:22.200 --> 03:18:26.760]  top generals are saying we're on the verge of World War three, the worst ever, no fly zones,
[03:18:26.760 --> 03:18:30.680]  threatening each other, Congress saying attack the Russians. And then the average American just
[03:18:30.680 --> 03:18:35.400]  has no idea this is going on. Yeah. And I'm getting emails to that. Well, you guys are just trying
[03:18:35.400 --> 03:18:40.440]  blah, blah, blah. Alex, when someone has spent the years you've spent, I've spent and others have
[03:18:40.440 --> 03:18:47.000]  spent, you know, the bottom line is that you do nine, 10, 12,000 hours, however many you've done,
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:52.760]  way more than I have. But when you spend in my case, you know, almost half my life at this and,
[03:18:52.760 --> 03:18:59.960]  and you, you get the idea that we're not, uh, you know, being up and up, people will deny it.
[03:18:59.960 --> 03:19:05.880]  Look, I'm sorry, but the only thing that will wake them up is something that's so catastrophic,
[03:19:05.880 --> 03:19:11.080]  so off their radar. Look, I know about Deutsche Bank. I bet, you know, I live in that world of
[03:19:11.080 --> 03:19:15.560]  finance and what's going on. And I've interviewed, we always, it's not bad. I mean, they're on the
[03:19:15.560 --> 03:19:18.920]  call. They bring up the issue. I think it's fine. He did. But I mean, here's an example. Bill Clinton
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:23.000]  has settled sexual assault cases. I've interviewed three women that say he rife, including one that
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:27.400]  had witnessed that came in two minutes after with her bloody in the hotel room. And, you know,
[03:19:27.400 --> 03:19:31.240]  I've got people out all over the country saying Bill Clinton's a rapist with my name on it.
[03:19:31.880 --> 03:19:35.880]  So I get the fact I'd have Kathy O'Brien on because I can't prove it one way or the other.
[03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:38.280]  We're going to have some really big people on next week. Get ready for that. I was going to
[03:19:38.280 --> 03:19:43.160]  stop right there. But Bill Clinton is a rapist. Trump supporter crashes Tim Cain Rowling. So,
[03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:47.240]  you know, we're doing as much as we can. Uh, absolutely. I just cannot go off
[03:19:48.120 --> 03:19:52.440]  stuff that is not documented. Uh, you know, I've got to go off him settling a rape case,
[03:19:52.440 --> 03:19:56.920]  an assault case. Then I could come out and say, you know, he settles rape cases and accuser of
[03:19:56.920 --> 03:20:00.120]  being a rapist. I know this Steve, he's certainly right in the Constitution.
[03:20:01.160 --> 03:20:06.600]  Well, the Constitution doesn't mean anything when, when George Bush Jr. took the name of the Lord
[03:20:06.600 --> 03:20:13.640]  in vain and says just a blank, blank, blank piece of paper. And now you come out and see, hey, Alex,
[03:20:13.640 --> 03:20:18.120]  when you were talking about the Bush dynasty, the Clinton crime family, and now we get, you know,
[03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:23.000]  them all admitting, including the daughters are voting for Hillary. Well, you know, what does
[03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:29.720]  that say? It means we have been under the rule and reign of terror. A dynastic family. That's right.
[03:20:29.720 --> 03:20:33.000]  And this family's the, the, the, the clums of the bushes, the vacation together,
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:36.680]  whatever they're really doing at Bohemian Grover, whatever, it's all coming down and they know it
[03:20:36.680 --> 03:20:40.600]  and they're scared and they're kind of threatening the world with World War Three. As the general
[03:20:40.600 --> 03:20:44.760]  said, you're not leaving Russia. You're not leaving UK. You're not leaving countries in Europe,
[03:20:44.760 --> 03:20:51.000]  America. You're not leaving. He's admitting he works for the new world order. Absolutely. And
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  where we're at right now is you can deny or you can prepare. Okay. You can assault those who are
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:01.560]  trying to give you the message or you can maybe take it to prayer and you can make it a matter of
[03:21:02.760 --> 03:21:08.760]  put it in the scales before your eyes. Are you, Alex Jones and me, Steve Quayle, giving enough
[03:21:08.760 --> 03:21:14.600]  evidence to help people, they better look beyond the obvious because it's the power brokers and
[03:21:14.600 --> 03:21:21.640]  their lap dog of vomit brokers. That's a mainstream media that are preparing a meal for you that will
[03:21:21.640 --> 03:21:28.120]  turn out to be your, the meal. They don't get it with like the more locks than the Deloitte of
[03:21:28.120 --> 03:21:33.000]  the time machine. And by the way, that was meant to wake the chair. He wrote a book called The New
[03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:36.680]  World Order and then it was an allegory of what was really going on. HG Wells. Yep. We're almost
[03:21:36.680 --> 03:21:40.520]  out of time. I'm going to hand the baton to David down here in a moment. Let's go to Cindy in
[03:21:40.520 --> 03:21:44.040]  Pennsylvania, one of the key battleground states, a lot of calls from Pennsylvania. Cindy, you're on
[03:21:44.040 --> 03:21:50.760]  the air. Thanks for calling in. Hi, Alex. Hi, Steve. I think we really got to ramp it up out here.
[03:21:50.760 --> 03:21:56.920]  Us warriors got to do a lot more to get Trump elected. Number one, we got to leave a paper
[03:21:56.920 --> 03:22:02.840]  trail at the election since they're monitoring it. I recommend that when people go and they
[03:22:02.840 --> 03:22:10.200]  find that paper that they match with the registration, when they find the paper, find your name
[03:22:10.200 --> 03:22:19.160]  after your name, write in Trump. Then when they add up all the machines, what not, those machines
[03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:26.920]  better match those sign-in papers. Number two, I would like to see billboards going up in
[03:22:27.720 --> 03:22:36.200]  minority areas with a big liver spot face of George Soros, huge. And on the other side, it's
[03:22:36.200 --> 03:22:42.040]  saying the man behind black lives matter. Do you really want to follow this man?
[03:22:43.880 --> 03:22:50.280]  Good idea. Call Cindy. Any comments, Steve? Well, well, I agree with that. And I agree with
[03:22:50.280 --> 03:22:55.400]  their people's proposing that they should wear red shirts. There are people that should immediately
[03:22:55.400 --> 03:22:59.960]  when the press is at any polling station, they should go up to the press and say, I want you
[03:22:59.960 --> 03:23:05.160]  to know I voted for Donald Trump. We get everybody doing that. And then there's going to be plenty
[03:23:05.160 --> 03:23:09.880]  of, I would say, confrontation. Yeah, that's right. That's right. The number one thing is,
[03:23:09.880 --> 03:23:13.320]  have showed the dominance at exit polls in the key battleground states. Go ahead.
[03:23:14.680 --> 03:23:19.400]  Well, I think, Alex, we're right on the countdown. Look, these people, let me say this,
[03:23:19.400 --> 03:23:25.320]  the power that's been stolen in this country from the people to destroy the people will never be
[03:23:25.320 --> 03:23:30.680]  given back to the people outside of a miraculous intervention of God. And people like the previous
[03:23:30.680 --> 03:23:36.360]  color said man in upstanding. And by the way, I salute all the women out there who are prayer
[03:23:36.360 --> 03:23:44.040]  warriors and are activists, never in my life have I seen the male species, you know, outside of the
[03:23:44.040 --> 03:23:47.480]  people. Well, I mean, the sperm's down 90 plus percent. We're getting hit with chemicals. They
[03:23:47.480 --> 03:23:52.360]  admit it. Well, yeah, they used to talk about a sperm count. Now basically, they have to talk
[03:23:52.360 --> 03:23:58.120]  about invisible sperm. That's right. Listen, we're out of time. Stevequell.com. We carry your new
[03:23:58.120 --> 03:24:03.560]  book and your new film dealing, of course, with the whole Vatican deception and the unholy sea.
[03:24:03.560 --> 03:24:07.800]  Very powerful. Again, not bashing Catholics, folks, but what's openly this new pop saying,
[03:24:07.800 --> 03:24:11.320]  go out to free speech, shut down conspiracy theorists. It's all the same talking points as
[03:24:11.320 --> 03:24:16.760]  Hillary. Evil is moving. This is a critical time in history. In four store.com to get those films.
[03:24:17.320 --> 03:24:21.800]  In fours, live.com, the new cynical Stevequell.com to also find all those books and all those
[03:24:21.800 --> 03:24:27.240]  films. Steve, thank you. Let's all again pray tonight for peace and for the world to wake up
[03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:30.760]  and to pull back from this, but definitely with all the top general saying nuclear war
[03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:34.840]  never closer. We've been vindicated. I really don't want to be vindicated with mushroom clouds.
[03:24:34.840 --> 03:24:39.480]  Steve, thank you. Thank you, Alex. Bye. Bye. All right. That's it, folks. I know I've got
[03:24:39.480 --> 03:24:42.600]  callers, but some of them have been holding like 20, 30 minutes. Others were holding longer.
[03:24:42.600 --> 03:24:47.240]  I'm going to hand the baton here in a few minutes today. Good night. But I want to be clear.
[03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:52.680]  I don't mind criticism because they always take what I say out of context and it just ends up
[03:24:52.680 --> 03:24:57.720]  sending us more listeners, more viewers and they find out what we're really saying. But
[03:24:57.720 --> 03:25:00.600]  when you have the head of the army and you have the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[03:25:01.160 --> 03:25:04.280]  and you have all these world leaders saying nuclear war has ever been closer and Russia
[03:25:04.280 --> 03:25:07.880]  is saying, oh, you're going to no fly us. You're going to shoot us down. Okay, no fly.
[03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:11.240]  Any other aircraft come in. We're shooting you down. That happened yesterday. That's hardly even
[03:25:11.240 --> 03:25:15.720]  in our news and Kerry coming out saying Russia is committing war crimes. I mean, this is crazy.
[03:25:15.720 --> 03:25:22.920]  Russia is just, you know, 100 miles or so from Syria. We are there doing this. The globalists
[03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:27.160]  that have got our borders open or are bushing our sovereignty and going after our guns and
[03:25:27.160 --> 03:25:31.000]  bankrupting our country and selling derivatives, they're the ones screwing Russia over as well.
[03:25:31.560 --> 03:25:35.800]  And it's so telling when I played that clip last hour of Army Chiefs of Staff,
[03:25:35.800 --> 03:25:41.160]  General Mark Milley saying, we've got the EU falling apart. We got Brexit. We got America.
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:45.880]  Russia, we're going to get you this blaming Russia. Like it caused people to wake up to the EU
[03:25:45.880 --> 03:25:50.760]  being a tyranny or the fact that Brexit happened or the fact that we are waking up. They're just
[03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:54.440]  another sovereign country. So they're identifying sovereign countries that don't want to be under
[03:25:54.440 --> 03:25:59.640]  new world order as the bad guys and we'll hit you harder German at the fire. You know, this guy
[03:25:59.640 --> 03:26:05.000]  wants to show off for George Soros, you know, and I got to say, I'm going to be looking into
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:09.800]  General Milley and talking to folks. I know that you know him and then ask what the hell is going
[03:26:09.800 --> 03:26:14.680]  on because, you know, looking like Frankenstein ain't going to make you win the nuclear war,
[03:26:14.680 --> 03:26:20.120]  bro. I don't mean to talk about how you look, but you know, the Pentagon's ability to steal
[03:26:20.120 --> 03:26:24.840]  $6 trillion, whatever it is, is one deal, but, you know, it's just, it's outrageous.
[03:26:26.600 --> 03:26:32.120]  It's outrageous. It's dangerous. It's crazy. It's, it's, it's bizarre. It's, it's, it's, it's,
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:38.040]  it's got to stop. And, you know, if Russia was say in the Caribbean trying to take our islands,
[03:26:38.040 --> 03:26:43.480]  I say blow the hell out of them. But the West is right up on their border starting wars with them.
[03:26:43.480 --> 03:26:49.640]  It's just wrong. And I hate seeing America, but you know America, we abort all our kids. We,
[03:26:50.280 --> 03:26:55.160]  we have, we have all the, all the Hollywood garbage, all the GMOs, all the, it's like,
[03:26:55.160 --> 03:26:59.000]  we've been conquered by evil because we were the good guys. It came here to lay its eggs.
[03:26:59.800 --> 03:27:06.040]  They gestated inside of us. They've not taken over. They're popping out now and pushing us to the
[03:27:06.040 --> 03:27:11.320]  edge of war. The globalist front woman is, looks like she has a rubber, you know, head like the
[03:27:11.320 --> 03:27:16.280]  Joker. She's got some crazy guy, creepy cane running around behind her. I mean, this all
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:22.360]  smells of destruction. And I have three children. And last night I was holding my
[03:27:22.360 --> 03:27:25.640]  year old daughter's hand. She was telling me how much she loved me after dinner.
[03:27:26.360 --> 03:27:29.960]  And I was beyond angry at the new world order. I'm just like, what are you people's problems?
[03:27:29.960 --> 03:27:36.280]  Why do you do all this bad stuff? It is because these are bad people. Bad people are willing to
[03:27:36.280 --> 03:27:40.200]  do stuff to get into power. Nobody else says, and that's the problem in history. And we have a really
[03:27:40.200 --> 03:27:45.880]  nasty crop of people in, and it doesn't mean Russia is perfect either, but it's not in an
[03:27:45.880 --> 03:27:52.280]  expansionist role. The globalist thought they had Russia down forever through a political
[03:27:52.280 --> 03:27:57.320]  system they brought in and it blew up in their face. And so I admire the fact that Russia has
[03:27:57.320 --> 03:28:01.320]  fought back against this and we're fighting back against it. And the UK is fighting back against
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:06.360]  it. And you know, three countries, three areas known for fighting back. Look what America did.
[03:28:06.360 --> 03:28:09.960]  And we're the first to defeat the global new world order out of the British empire, the first.
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:15.480]  Then India and others followed suit. So we face new forms of colonialism. We have to defeat those
[03:28:16.040 --> 03:28:21.560]  and be self-determined as nation states based on a basic code. All right, I'm going to go ahead
[03:28:21.560 --> 03:28:24.920]  and go to break and give this over to David Knight. We need your financial support. I mean,
[03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:28.680]  I'm not going to sit here and belabor it. I skip breaks half the time and don't even hardly plug.
[03:28:28.680 --> 03:28:33.480]  We need you to buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the nutraceuticals. Everybody should
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:37.800]  take probiotics. We've got the best out there. We've done the research. 23% off DNA force right
[03:28:37.800 --> 03:28:42.200]  now. Free shipping when you sign up for auto ship or you get 10% off when you sign up for auto
[03:28:42.200 --> 03:28:47.480]  ship. Free shipping on orders, $50 or more. I've been misspeaking, but it's 10% off, which is
[03:28:47.480 --> 03:28:51.960]  bigger than shipping usually when you sign up for auto ship. And then free shipping on top of that
[03:28:51.960 --> 03:28:56.440]  of orders, $50 or more. So I've been saying that wrong as I'm teleprompter free and I've been working
[03:28:56.440 --> 03:29:01.880]  a little bit more than I normally do. So I'm a little bit punch drunk sometimes. But get DNA
[03:29:01.880 --> 03:29:06.360]  force, 23% off the amazing product. But regardless of your support in the broadcast, the M4 solar
[03:29:06.360 --> 03:29:11.720]  base station and control unit as well as panels, which are just amazing, high quality, last eight
[03:29:11.720 --> 03:29:16.520]  times longer than your typical unit because they're phosphate, battery, lithium, ion, iron,
[03:29:16.520 --> 03:29:24.120]  powered. That's at infowarstore.com. David Knight is straight ahead. Stay with us. And we will
[03:29:24.120 --> 03:29:29.480]  obviously have Sunday coverage of the debates live, kicking off at 4pm central standard time.
[03:29:29.480 --> 03:29:33.160]  Please spread the word. You are the resistance. You are the info war. Never forget that.
[03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:45.960]  We're now only 31 days out. Only two days out from our live debate coverage. Spread the word.
[03:29:48.920 --> 03:29:54.280]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:29:54.280 --> 03:30:03.720]  Coming to a city near you, ISIS serial killers. That's right. An ISIS magazine,
[03:30:03.720 --> 03:30:09.720]  Rumaia, is recruiting serial killers to carry out knife attacks in the West. This hate group or
[03:30:09.720 --> 03:30:14.280]  religion of peace, according to Hillary Clinton, explains to potential recruits how they don't
[03:30:14.280 --> 03:30:20.040]  need a gun to terrorize innocent people. They just need a knife. This same publication also calls
[03:30:20.040 --> 03:30:25.320]  for its servants to shed blood and even to die for their cause. How would you describe that?
[03:30:25.320 --> 03:30:30.360]  Radical Islam? I'm sure Barack Obama will be ignoring this because radical Islam doesn't exist
[03:30:30.360 --> 03:30:34.680]  to him. I'm sure Hillary Clinton will turn a blind eye to this as well, as she doesn't want to
[03:30:34.680 --> 03:30:40.120]  offend anyone on the eve of an election. Here's a crazy idea. Find out whoever is publishing this
[03:30:40.120 --> 03:30:45.000]  mass murderer producing hate rag and start questioning him and his entire staff. It's okay
[03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:49.640]  to assume it's a man as they're in charge of women in radical Islam. Then jail him or
[03:30:49.640 --> 03:30:55.000]  start getting some answers on ISIS leaders immediately. Or are we really that incompetent?
[03:30:55.000 --> 03:31:23.720]  This is Owen Schreuer from infowars.com.
[03:31:25.640 --> 03:31:30.280]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old

[03:32:01.400 --> 03:32:07.160]  Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain force did.
[03:32:07.160 --> 03:32:12.520]  I'd been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 830.
[03:32:12.520 --> 03:32:15.880]  I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it,
[03:32:15.880 --> 03:32:19.480]  and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right
[03:32:19.480 --> 03:32:24.680]  there. I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears
[03:32:24.680 --> 03:32:29.960]  up. It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party
[03:32:29.960 --> 03:32:35.080]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best organic-based
[03:32:35.080 --> 03:32:39.160]  systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[03:32:39.160 --> 03:32:43.560]  but I probably could not have done it without brain force. I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[03:32:44.120 --> 03:32:47.800]  took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force, and came in.

[03:33:05.640 --> 03:33:11.480]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:11.480 --> 03:33:21.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host for the rest of this fourth hour,
[03:33:21.320 --> 03:33:27.960]  Friday, October 7th, 2016. And Alex has been talking through this show about the madness
[03:33:28.600 --> 03:33:32.920]  of the Cold War that Hillary Clinton has brought to us. And one of the things that really stuck
[03:33:32.920 --> 03:33:39.400]  out to me in the vice presidential debate the other night was Governor Cain talking about
[03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:45.160]  Hillary Clinton going toe-to-toe with the Russians. He said it not once, but three times, folks. It
[03:33:45.160 --> 03:33:49.720]  was very deliberate. And as I was talking to my wife after the debate, I thought, you know,
[03:33:50.680 --> 03:33:55.480]  toe-to-toe with the Ruskies, Dr. Strangelove. That's really what their foreign policy is,
[03:33:55.480 --> 03:34:01.240]  is Dr. Strangelove. And so on the nightly news on Wednesday, I did a video, Cain says Hillary
[03:34:01.240 --> 03:34:05.960]  goes toe-to-toe with the Ruskies. And we played some clips of Dr. Strangelove. Now, many of you
[03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:10.040]  have not seen this. Maybe you're too young to have seen Dr. Strangelove. It's one I think of
[03:34:10.040 --> 03:34:15.960]  Stanley Kubrick's finest films. Because what it did was it showed the madness of the Cold War.
[03:34:16.600 --> 03:34:23.400]  And the Cold War was based on a policy of madness, mutual assured destruction. And one of the things,
[03:34:23.400 --> 03:34:28.440]  the subtitle of that movie was, How I Stopped, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.
[03:34:29.560 --> 03:34:33.880]  And how they learned to love the bomb was they realized that the elitist could go to their
[03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:38.920]  underground bunkers and have the entire world to themselves after all of this stuff hit the fan.
[03:34:39.880 --> 03:34:46.920]  And so in this report that we did, we took some clips from Dr. Strangelove and juxtaposed them
[03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:50.520]  with what Cain said. You know, you got Slim Pickens there saying, this is it, boys.
[03:34:51.160 --> 03:34:57.240]  It's nuclear combat toe-to-toe with the Ruskies. And we've got clips in there of George C. Scott's
[03:34:57.240 --> 03:35:05.160]  character, General Buck Tergeson, who is being reincarnated, folks, reincarnated by General
[03:35:05.160 --> 03:35:09.240]  Milley. You need to take a look at that video. But I want to play for you now a video that we
[03:35:09.240 --> 03:35:14.760]  did last night as part of the Nightly News. Because today is the release of a new film,
[03:35:15.320 --> 03:35:21.240]  Birth of a Nation. And the title of this, if you see it on Alex Jones' channel, is Birth of a Nation
[03:35:21.240 --> 03:35:27.480]  and Death of a Dream. Because what I do is I juxtapose in this report the vision that was given
[03:35:27.480 --> 03:35:34.520]  to us by Martin Luther King and the vision that is being sold to us now by those people who are
[03:35:34.520 --> 03:35:41.560]  followers of Bill Ayers, the universities, the filmmakers, who want to base everything on
[03:35:42.680 --> 03:35:47.160]  racism, quite frankly. And there's a story that broke today that was on NPR. And I'm going to talk
[03:35:47.160 --> 03:35:53.640]  about this when we come back from the report. The country of Ghana wants to remove a statue of Gandhi
[03:35:54.360 --> 03:36:01.000]  because, I said, in his early life, he made some comments that are racist. It never stops, folks.
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:04.680]  It never stops. Now they're going to go after Gandhi. And you know what? They need to go after
[03:36:04.680 --> 03:36:11.080]  Martin Luther King as well. Because Martin Luther King used Gandhi's tactics. He was a follower of
[03:36:11.080 --> 03:36:16.520]  Gandhi, an admirer of Gandhi. So therefore, that makes Dr. Martin Luther King a racist as well.
[03:36:16.520 --> 03:36:21.640]  Let's play that report, Birth of a Nation, Death of a Dream. You know, it was about 50 years ago
[03:36:21.640 --> 03:36:27.720]  that Martin Luther King made his I Have a Dream speech. And as we look at the opening of a new
[03:36:27.720 --> 03:36:33.720]  film called Birth of a Nation, that's going to open tomorrow, I think what we see is the death
[03:36:33.720 --> 03:36:37.080]  of that dream. Let me play for you, Martin Luther King's speech.
[03:36:37.080 --> 03:36:48.360]  I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be
[03:36:48.360 --> 03:36:54.040]  judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.
[03:36:55.400 --> 03:37:01.160]  There you go. Not judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. And
[03:37:01.160 --> 03:37:06.120]  yet, everything that we see today from the university systems where children are educated,
[03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:13.000]  even before that, going K through 12, everything there as well as the media, as well as Hollywood,
[03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:18.600]  is there to focus on race, to focus on the superficiality of skin color, to take away the
[03:37:18.600 --> 03:37:21.880]  idea that we're going to treat each other as individuals. The other part of the speech that
[03:37:21.880 --> 03:37:25.800]  Martin Luther King said before he got to that point was he said, part of his dream was that the
[03:37:25.800 --> 03:37:32.120]  nation would rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, that all men are created equal,
[03:37:32.120 --> 03:37:37.400]  that people would be judged as individuals. Here's what Morgan Freeman said more recently,
[03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:40.840]  although it's still been a number of years, to Mike Wallace in 60 minutes.
[03:37:41.800 --> 03:37:47.800]  I don't want a black history month. Black history is American history. How are we going to get rid
[03:37:47.800 --> 03:37:54.840]  of racism and start talking about it? I'm going to stop calling you a white man.
[03:37:54.840 --> 03:38:03.000]  Yeah. And I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man. I know you as Mike Wallace,
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:08.680]  you know me as Mormon Freeman. You know this white guy named Mike Wallace. You know what I'm saying?
[03:38:11.240 --> 03:38:15.400]  So what you heard there was Morgan Freeman having to explain this to a liberal Mike Wallace,
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:18.440]  what this really means. And of course, Mike Wallace was talking to him about black history
[03:38:18.440 --> 03:38:22.840]  month. He said, I don't want black history month. He says, where's your white history month? He says,
[03:38:22.840 --> 03:38:26.040]  well, I'm not white. I'm Jewish. Well, where's your Jewish history month? Then he goes,
[03:38:26.040 --> 03:38:30.840]  how are we going to fix racism if we don't have a black history month? He said, treat me as an
[03:38:30.840 --> 03:38:36.920]  individual. What Morgan Freeman was doing was explaining to Mike Wallace what that really
[03:38:36.920 --> 03:38:41.080]  means to judge people by the content of their character instead of the color of their skin.
[03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:46.360]  He said, get, stop talking about it. Don't refer to me as a black man. I've got a name.
[03:38:46.360 --> 03:38:52.120]  You've got a name. Use my name. Treat me as an individual. But that's not what we see in
[03:38:52.120 --> 03:38:57.480]  the universities. This story that came out this week from the college fix looks at university
[03:38:58.200 --> 03:39:05.160]  distribution of a seven page speech guide. Okay. And this is at James Madison University. James
[03:39:05.160 --> 03:39:12.760]  Madison, the father of our bill of rights, the guy who enshrined the understanding of freedom of
[03:39:12.760 --> 03:39:17.080]  speech as well as the rights of the individual. The bill of rights is about individual rights.
[03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:21.560]  It's not about collective groups. It's not about breaking us into groups. It's about saying that
[03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:25.160]  all men are created equal. Exactly what Martin Luther King was talking about. And yet at the
[03:39:25.160 --> 03:39:30.040]  university named after James Madison, here's what they're telling people. 35 things you should
[03:39:30.040 --> 03:39:34.360]  avoid saying. Phrases like, you have such a pretty face, love the center, hate the
[03:39:34.360 --> 03:39:41.240]  sin. We're all part of the human race or I treat all people the same about that. But they say,
[03:39:41.240 --> 03:39:46.360]  those phrases are don't create an inclusive environment. So to say that I treat all people
[03:39:46.360 --> 03:39:50.840]  the same, to say that we're all part of the human race, that's not inclusive. They say to say, I
[03:39:50.840 --> 03:39:56.360]  don't see color, I'm colorblind. That's wrong, according to the political correctness, which is
[03:39:56.360 --> 03:40:01.240]  really nothing but political censorship, folks. We have to understand the political agenda behind
[03:40:01.240 --> 03:40:07.320]  this, how they are dividing us and how they're trying to make us go to war with each other.
[03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:12.200]  We're all part of the same race, the human race. Those were all advised against. Those are bad.
[03:40:12.200 --> 03:40:18.040]  It's bad to say that. That's not inclusive. See, this is the kind of Orwellian double
[03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:23.000]  think that they're trying to enforce upon you. No, that is inclusive to say that there's no
[03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:27.320]  difference between us. Just as Morgan Friedman was saying, stop referring to me as his black
[03:40:27.320 --> 03:40:31.720]  man, Morgan Friedman. Just refer to me as Morgan Friedman. I won't refer to you as a white guy,
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:36.200]  Chris Wallace. Can't we do that? No, we can. According to Columbia University, they have a
[03:40:36.200 --> 03:40:42.600]  no whites allowed student leadership retreat. This also came out this week. Students of color
[03:40:42.600 --> 03:40:47.000]  at Columbia University, only students of color, can apply to attend an upcoming
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:52.520]  racially segregated retreat hosted by that school that promises to embolden and to empower
[03:40:52.520 --> 03:40:58.120]  participants according to organizers. Does it really embolden and empower you to reduce you
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:03.800]  to your skin color? Why is that so important anymore today? We should move beyond that,
[03:41:03.800 --> 03:41:08.520]  just as we don't segregate people or punish people because of the color of their hair.
[03:41:09.080 --> 03:41:13.240]  Why is the color of the skin the thing that we should be focused on? It is a political tool,
[03:41:13.240 --> 03:41:17.560]  folks. You need to understand that. They say this retreat is designed for students who identify
[03:41:17.560 --> 03:41:23.640]  themselves as a person of color as their primary identity. Oh, so are they going to
[03:41:24.600 --> 03:41:28.280]  allow Rachel Delezal to go there because she identifies as a person of color? I mean,
[03:41:28.280 --> 03:41:32.520]  can you be a white person and identify as a person of color and then be included in this
[03:41:32.520 --> 03:41:38.840]  retreat if you buy into their racist madness? Let's take a look at Morgan Friedman when he's
[03:41:38.840 --> 03:41:44.280]  talking to Don Lemon. This is very recent. We have Don Lemon pushing the idea to him
[03:41:44.920 --> 03:41:52.120]  for his CNN people that he works for that black people can't get ahead because they're black.
[03:41:52.120 --> 03:41:57.400]  And here's what Morgan Friedman says. Do you think that race plays a part in wealth distribution
[03:41:57.400 --> 03:42:04.360]  or either a mindset that you can't? True day? Yeah. No, you don't. No, I don't. I don't. You and I
[03:42:04.360 --> 03:42:08.840]  will prove. Why would race have anything to do with it? Stick to it. Put your mind to what you
[03:42:08.840 --> 03:42:17.480]  want to do and go for that. It's kind of like religion to me. It's a good excuse for not
[03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:22.520]  getting there. Yeah. You know, I said it's probably getting me in trouble, but... Okay. Why would he
[03:42:22.520 --> 03:42:27.320]  say this is probably going to get me in trouble because it will get him in trouble because that's
[03:42:27.320 --> 03:42:32.760]  what CNN is a part of. They're a part of selling that agenda. And he understands that. He says,
[03:42:32.760 --> 03:42:38.440]  look, it's an excuse, said Morgan Friedman, to use your lack of achievement to blame it on
[03:42:38.440 --> 03:42:43.880]  your skin color is an excuse. Work harder. Do something different. Find a different people
[03:42:43.880 --> 03:42:48.520]  to work for if they're going to discriminate against you. It is a tool of control. It is a
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:52.600]  tool of control by our government. It's a tool of control by the media. But then let's look at why
[03:42:53.720 --> 03:42:59.000]  Chris or Don Lemon says this is going to get me in trouble. Listen to what he says.
[03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:03.960]  Oh, but I said to some of my colleagues recently said, so I know that it's an issue,
[03:43:04.520 --> 03:43:08.120]  but I've been, it seems like every single day on television, I'm talking about race,
[03:43:08.120 --> 03:43:12.520]  and it's because of the news cycle. It's in the news, but sometimes I get so tired of talking
[03:43:12.520 --> 03:43:17.320]  about it. I want to, I want to just go, this is over. Can we move on? And if you talk about it,
[03:43:17.320 --> 03:43:25.640]  it exists. It's not like it exists. And we didn't refuse to talk about it. But making it a bigger
[03:43:25.640 --> 03:43:30.840]  issue than it needs to be is a problem we have. They catch what Morgan Freeman said. He said,
[03:43:30.840 --> 03:43:36.680]  making it a bigger issue than it needs to be is the problem here, which brings us to birth of a
[03:43:36.680 --> 03:43:42.280]  nation. Making it a bigger problem than it needs to be for political purposes, folks, as a daily
[03:43:42.280 --> 03:43:47.160]  caller points out, an explosive new movie today about a slave rebellion has some worried that it
[03:43:47.160 --> 03:43:51.880]  may provoke rioting and unrest. That's precisely what it was calculated to do. Promoter of the
[03:43:51.880 --> 03:43:56.600]  movie said, well, we can't control how the film is ultimately read, what actions people may take,
[03:43:56.600 --> 03:44:00.920]  but one message has been that there are very reliable and practical steps that they can take.
[03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:05.080]  Oh, what would that be? Fox Searchlight, the film's distributor, has not hidden the political
[03:44:05.080 --> 03:44:10.200]  motivation, says daily caller for the movie, but rather encouraged viewers to take the film as a
[03:44:10.200 --> 03:44:16.920]  call to quote unquote, rise up. It pushes the film as a provocation, but a peaceful provocation.
[03:44:16.920 --> 03:44:22.040]  The New York Times writes, the film has been marketed as an urgent call to action. What is
[03:44:22.040 --> 03:44:27.080]  that urgent call to action? The urgent call to action is to rise up and more black lives matter
[03:44:27.080 --> 03:44:32.680]  types of actions, more violent actions to put Hillary Clinton in office because it's all about
[03:44:32.680 --> 03:44:37.800]  divide and conquer. So perhaps the most inflammatory part of the film is the gang rape of Turner's
[03:44:37.800 --> 03:44:42.840]  wife, a black woman by a group of white men. However, this event has no historical basis.
[03:44:42.840 --> 03:44:48.600]  In fact, the real cause for Turner's rebellion is a solar eclipse in 1831 that Turner believed to be
[03:44:48.600 --> 03:44:52.920]  a sign from God. Now, in case you don't believe the daily caller, you say, oh, it's a conservative
[03:44:53.960 --> 03:44:57.960]  group. Well, look at the nation. They reviewed this film. They said the birth of a nation is
[03:44:57.960 --> 03:45:02.440]  an epic fail from its depictions of black women to the representation of slavery itself. Nate
[03:45:02.440 --> 03:45:07.080]  Parker's film is deeply flawed historically and accurate. They say Parker was correct. We said
[03:45:07.080 --> 03:45:12.040]  somewhat flippantly, nothing is ever 100% historically accurate. But they say, but how do
[03:45:12.040 --> 03:45:17.320]  we feel about a film that contains only a smidgen of historical fact? What if the historical inaccuracies
[03:45:17.320 --> 03:45:22.280]  are damaging and insidious? Consider, for example, the film's troubling depictions of a black woman.
[03:45:22.280 --> 03:45:27.000]  A crucial turning point in the movie occurs when Turner's wife, Cherry, is brutally gang raped by
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:32.120]  a group of slave patrollers and attacked the film portrays as the spark that ultimately drove Turner
[03:45:32.120 --> 03:45:39.480]  to launch his rebellion. It never happened, says the nation. Isn't it interesting that the star and
[03:45:39.480 --> 03:45:44.520]  writer of this and the co-writer of this were themselves accused of rape? And as we've seen
[03:45:44.520 --> 03:45:52.760]  this last summer, Sabo put out the poster showing the provocative film here with Nate Turner, the
[03:45:52.760 --> 03:45:56.600]  star with the American flag around his neck like a noose and put underneath it rapist.
[03:45:57.240 --> 03:46:02.360]  Jean Celestine was convicted later had his case overturned on a technicality.
[03:46:03.080 --> 03:46:07.160]  Isn't it amazing the parallels to Bill and Hillary Clinton? As a matter of fact, even her first
[03:46:07.160 --> 03:46:13.640]  important case, she got overturned on a technicality and laughed about the fact she got a rapist off.
[03:46:14.200 --> 03:46:19.960]  For FOWARS.com, I'm David Knight. All right, and that report is Birth of a Nation,
[03:46:19.960 --> 03:46:24.920]  Death of a Dream, contrasting the racism that is being sold to us by these people
[03:46:24.920 --> 03:46:30.280]  who have a past, painted in rape just like Bill and Hillary Clinton. And folks,
[03:46:30.280 --> 03:46:35.160]  when you look at the title that he chose, again, Birth of the Nation, that was a title of DW
[03:46:35.160 --> 03:46:40.360]  Griffith's groundbreaking film, groundbreaking in the sense that it was the first time
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:47.640]  Silent Film had had a massive story narrative, big production values recreating parts of the
[03:46:47.640 --> 03:46:53.560]  Civil War, the assassination of Lincoln and so forth. But it was a story that went on to talk
[03:46:53.560 --> 03:46:59.800]  about Reconstruction and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. And quite frankly, I think he chose this
[03:46:59.800 --> 03:47:04.280]  title, Birth of a Nation, because he is hoping that people are going to rise up, that it's going
[03:47:04.280 --> 03:47:10.840]  to inspire Black Lives Matter. We should be very careful with this kind of hatred, this kind of
[03:47:10.840 --> 03:47:15.720]  racism that is represented by Birth of a Nation. You have to understand that in the real slave
[03:47:15.720 --> 03:47:19.960]  rebellion that was done by Nat Turner, there's nothing other than the wholesale murder of
[03:47:19.960 --> 03:47:25.640]  anybody with white skin. That's the bottom line, folks. And when you look at that, combined with
[03:47:27.400 --> 03:47:32.680]  John Brown, James Brown, John Brown trying to do a slave rebellion as well, those two things,
[03:47:32.680 --> 03:47:38.920]  hardened attitudes in the South, created fear, distrust, anger against the North that they felt
[03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:45.880]  were trying to violently murder people in the South, that fed into the Civil War. You didn't
[03:47:45.880 --> 03:47:52.200]  have a race war. You didn't have the slaves rise up, but you did get a civil war. That is what
[03:47:52.200 --> 03:47:57.800]  they want. They want division. They don't want diversity. They don't want inclusion. That's
[03:47:57.800 --> 03:48:02.200]  what we should understand about that. Nothing shows us, I think, better than the insanity
[03:48:02.200 --> 03:48:07.000]  that's going on now in Ghana. Because look, all of these university professors, whether here in
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:12.680]  the United States or whether they're abroad in an African nation, they're all feeding out of the
[03:48:12.680 --> 03:48:20.760]  same trough. They're all focused on this academia selling this racism narrative. This is from NPR.
[03:48:20.760 --> 03:48:26.360]  The nation of Ghana wants to remove statue of Mahatma Gandhi over a racism controversy. They
[03:48:26.360 --> 03:48:30.600]  say professors at the University of Ghana demanded the removal of a statue of Gandhi
[03:48:30.600 --> 03:48:36.600]  over what their petition calls his racist identity. His racist identity. There you go.
[03:48:36.600 --> 03:48:42.440]  He's got implicit bias, I guess. They say the iconic Indian civil rights leader has inspired
[03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:47.080]  peaceful protests worldwide, including in many African countries. And as a point out, he was
[03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:54.440]  the inspiration for Martin Luther King having a peaceful resistance against the Jim Crow laws in
[03:48:54.440 --> 03:48:59.160]  the South. Well, we don't want that duly for government. We don't want people coming together
[03:48:59.160 --> 03:49:03.880]  peacefully to change laws. No, we want to have violent revolution. Keep them divided. Keep them
[03:49:03.880 --> 03:49:08.280]  under our thumb. That's a much better way to go, isn't it? They say Ghana professors point to comments
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:13.320]  that Gandhi made early in his career. How they say, well, historians teach and explain that
[03:49:13.320 --> 03:49:21.800]  Gandhi was uncharitable in his attitude toward the black race. Look, nobody is perfect. And we
[03:49:21.800 --> 03:49:26.840]  see this. You can nitpick on people and you can say they never changed. I mean, we've had a lot of
[03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:33.720]  Gandhi had massive changes in his life, of all things. This guy had a tremendous, tremendous
[03:49:33.720 --> 03:49:38.200]  change throughout his life he evolved. If you're going to come after Gandhi, nobody is safe. And
[03:49:38.200 --> 03:49:43.640]  of course, nobody is safe. We see them coming after statues of Thomas Jefferson, statues of James
[03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:49.320]  Madison, Andrew Jackson they want to take down from New Orleans, even though this is a guy who
[03:49:49.320 --> 03:49:55.880]  organized all the citizenry there of every color, every economic group, even pulling in the pirates
[03:49:55.880 --> 03:50:00.920]  to save the town from British invasion or they would have burned it to the ground. But you can't
[03:50:00.920 --> 03:50:05.800]  put a statue up of him because he did some bad things. And he did some bad things, even did
[03:50:05.800 --> 03:50:11.800]  some bad things as president. But we have to understand, we have to look at what people do
[03:50:11.800 --> 03:50:16.680]  that is right. And we have to celebrate that. And we have to come together instead of dividing
[03:50:16.680 --> 03:50:20.760]  people. If you're going to take this down for a Gandhi, as I said before, you're going to have to
[03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:25.400]  take down the statues, rename the streets that were named after Martin Luther.
[03:50:25.400 --> 03:50:29.720]  It came because he was a follower of Gandhi. He was a follower of peaceful protests.
[03:50:29.720 --> 03:50:34.920]  Now, Gandhi's ministry of foreign affairs said they were following this controversy with deep
[03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:39.400]  concern. They said, we acknowledge that as human as he was, Gandhi may have had his flaws. We must
[03:50:39.400 --> 03:50:42.840]  remember that people evolved. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world,
[03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:49.480]  exactly right. But then they cave. They say, want to move it anyway. They say that it's an
[03:50:49.480 --> 03:50:53.240]  unfortunate verbal attack. It creates this affection not only at the level of government
[03:50:53.240 --> 03:50:57.240]  relations, but also between people. So because some people are offended by it, we've got to take
[03:50:57.240 --> 03:51:01.080]  them down. We've got to purge it. Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals? Are

[03:54:19.720 --> 03:54:23.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're going to go back. I've got some
[03:54:23.560 --> 03:54:29.080]  more comments to make about Birth of a Nation that is being released in theaters today, hoping to do,
[03:54:29.080 --> 03:54:35.400]  I think, for the Black Lives Matter violent movement, what the original Birth of the Nation
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:38.920]  did for the Ku Klux Klan. I think that's what these people want to do. Certainly they want to
[03:54:38.920 --> 03:54:43.560]  affect the election. And we have to understand, as I was just talking about, the fact where this
[03:54:43.560 --> 03:54:48.520]  is going to end up, just as we see these idiotic professors at the University of Ghana saying they
[03:54:48.520 --> 03:54:53.480]  want to take down a statue of Gandhi. And here's their justification when they get right down to it.
[03:54:53.480 --> 03:54:59.320]  They say, why should we uplift other people's heroes at an African University when we haven't
[03:54:59.320 --> 03:55:05.160]  uplifted our own? Well, let me tell you, you idiots, it's because he's not being honored
[03:55:05.160 --> 03:55:11.960]  because he's Indian. You want to reduce him to being an Indian. Just as you accuse him or other
[03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:17.320]  people of reducing you to simply being black, you do that to yourselves. You're reducing yourselves
[03:55:17.320 --> 03:55:23.560]  to the least common denominator. Gandhi is honored because of what he achieved as an individual.
[03:55:24.120 --> 03:55:28.760]  Because he showed us what we can achieve as individuals if we come together collectively
[03:55:28.760 --> 03:55:33.320]  and peacefully for freedom. And you don't want to have any of that, do you? You and your government
[03:55:33.320 --> 03:55:39.400]  masters don't want us to see that. He is honored because he's a unique individual. And the people
[03:55:39.400 --> 03:55:44.520]  who put his statue up at that African University understood that. But that understanding no longer
[03:55:44.520 --> 03:55:49.400]  exists there. Now, I want to talk about the hurricane briefly and Matt drudges reaction to it. But
[03:55:49.400 --> 03:55:56.200]  before I do, real quickly, we have DNA Force for 23% off at infowarslife.com. We offer our products

[03:56:47.320 --> 03:56:53.400]  on the web. See the reviews that people have put there about DNA Force. Now, in the short amount
[03:56:53.400 --> 03:56:59.000]  of time that we've got left, we have an article up on infowars.com today. Drudge, Matt drudge asks,
[03:56:59.000 --> 03:57:02.920]  is the government lying about Hurricane Matthew? In the words, are they over exaggerating this?
[03:57:02.920 --> 03:57:09.160]  Now, I've seen this, I grew up in Florida. I've seen many Hurricanes come and go. And
[03:57:10.280 --> 03:57:16.680]  whether it hits you directly or not, most of the time they would sound the alarm at a higher level
[03:57:16.680 --> 03:57:21.720]  than it actually was. But whether that is true or not with this particular one, the way that this
[03:57:21.720 --> 03:57:30.440]  is being used to promote a one world government with carbon taxes against everybody, understand
[03:57:30.440 --> 03:57:36.920]  that is the fundamental issue behind all this anthropomorphic global warming nonsense climate
[03:57:36.920 --> 03:57:44.280]  change. Look, if this is a product of climate change, I say we ought to celebrate climate change.
[03:57:44.280 --> 03:57:49.160]  Not because we've got a big hurricane right now, but because we've had a hiatus of Hurricanes for
[03:57:49.160 --> 03:57:58.120]  over a decade. It's something growing up my entire life to my mid 20s in Florida. We never saw a
[03:57:58.120 --> 03:58:04.120]  period of time where we had so few Hurricanes. So if you want to blame this on man made climate
[03:58:04.120 --> 03:58:09.560]  change, bring it on. And I would go outside if I had one and crank up my diesel engines,
[03:58:09.560 --> 03:58:13.960]  even if I didn't need them. Because if it's going to protect us for 10 years from having a
[03:58:13.960 --> 03:58:18.680]  destructive hurricane like this is a good thing, isn't it? But I don't believe that's the case.
[03:58:18.680 --> 03:58:37.160]  Anyway, look, join us tonight. 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern for the info wars and nightly news. I'm David Knight.
