[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  On this Wednesday, January 30th, 2019, global transmission,
[00:33.000 --> 00:42.000]  we have the very interesting, intelligent and informed lawyer
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  for many of the Covington Catholic school children and young people
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  that were demonized and attacked in studio with us
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  to talk about a wide range of topics.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  I went to dinner with him last night.
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  Really smart guys. We're talking about a wide range of topics.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.000]  Stewart Rhodes is there at the Covington school.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  He's got some breaking news with Oath Keepers.
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.000]  He'll be popping in Roger Stone to the fourth hour.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  Man Cow has been off the air for about two years,
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  his own personal decision.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  He's now back on TV and radio.
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  He should be popping in sometime during his first hour.
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  If you think my voice is a little gravellier than normally,
[01:20.000 --> 01:21.000]  you're absolutely right.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.000]  You know, just saying last week I haven't gotten a fever in years.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  And I don't have a fever.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  I have mold and mountain cedar just coating my lungs and my larynx,
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  so I sound particularly toad-like.
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  It's hard to not cough, but I'm going to hold the line here
[01:39.000 --> 01:40.000]  and get that job done.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  You know, I haven't really gotten involved in this whole
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg is dead thing.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  Fox and Friends, as you know, two weeks ago, said that she was dead
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  or put a graphic on screen saying the year she was born
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  in 2019.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  So everybody's basically got those already loaded in their computers
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  for different TV networks.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  But a lot of people have been saying,
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  why hasn't she been seen in months?
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  And it's the first time ever she hasn't shown up for a bunch of votes,
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  even though she's had cancer treatment and surgeries before.
[02:11.000 --> 02:14.000]  That points towards her maybe being incognizant,
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  maybe on a respirator.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  It would be the first time that they keep somebody alive
[02:19.000 --> 02:23.000]  just so that the other party doesn't get somebody into office
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  into that key position there at the Supreme Court.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  But Jack Busovic's got a lot of really top flight forces,
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  and he's right about 99% of the time.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  He says that his source that he trusted explicitly
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  saw Ruth Bader Ginsburg was spotted with a trainer
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  at a prominent DC gym yesterday.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  He's recovered well, enough to work out.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  State of the Union appearance, question mark.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  And so I think that is probably accurate.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  Of course, there could be someone that looked like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  There's a lot of spider-like crones, sea hags there in DC,
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  skexies, dark crystal escapees.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  We will see.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  We will find out, obviously, but Ruth Bader Ginsburg
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  wants to butcher as many babies in the womb as she can.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  Her mindset and her eugenics-based anti-human mindset
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  is an abomination.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  And the sooner we get somebody on the Supreme Court
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  to reverse the Democrats, who are actually pushing
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  through Dr. Peter Singer and others, who's very influential
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  and left us demonic circles, to actually euthanize people
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  up to age three, including Down syndrome children.
[03:43.000 --> 03:45.000]  And, of course, many areas of Europe
[03:45.000 --> 03:48.000]  have passed laws to make you abort Down syndrome children.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  We've played Dutch TV programs, news programs,
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  where they talk to a Down syndrome gentleman
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  who's very high-functioning Down syndrome
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  and tell him, you know, you cost us more than double
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  the average Dutch person.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  You're a worthless piece of crap.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  And that dove tells with what just happened,
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  of course, in New York.
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  They passed a law that a woman's service to be dilated,
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  the head can be crowning, the baby can be coming out,
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  they can kill the baby any time they want to.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  That's law now, with the ghoul governor up there.
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  Well, now the story's on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Very important to get this out to people.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  We're going to play the video coming up.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  Sick Virginia Dems are just billed to allow abortion right
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  before a woman is giving birth.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  And then they lie and say, well, it's if the doctor does it
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  for the health or mental welfare of the woman.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  It's not called abortion if there's a complication in birth
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  that the baby dies to save the mother or vice versa.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  The baby just died in birth.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  It's not called an abortion.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  So they play a lot of semantical games for the bottom line.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  If they can't abort your baby, they want to give you a bunch
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  of vaccines to brain damage you.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  And if that doesn't work, they'll push to have your son's
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  genitals chopped off because it's so trendy.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  They want to kill your young boys particularly.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  TurboForce from InfoWarsLife is a powerful mix-in energy packet
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity,
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  and a boost of energy on the go.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water,
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  and enjoy.
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply,
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[05:41.000 --> 05:44.000]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[05:49.000 --> 06:04.000]  Hercup with TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  We've got it.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  Waging War on Corruption.
[06:30.000 --> 06:37.000]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  You know, most of the things we talk about on this broadcast
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  are actually completely admitted and documented.
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  But they sound so insane that people think,
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  oh, that must not be true.
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  And I've got a few examples of that here in front of me today.
[06:59.000 --> 07:01.000]  We're going to be going over.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  I saw this article and I thought, why not go deeper than this
[07:05.000 --> 07:11.000]  and actually get into the bigger story, the bigger picture
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.000]  and what the main causes of mental illness on this planet are
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  and the establishment is completely aware of it.
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.000]  Mind-altering parasites spread by cats may lead to schizophrenia.
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  Daily mail, common parasites spread by cats
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  that's carried by 2 million people may lead to schizophrenia.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  Researchers fear and then it goes on.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  Well, they don't fear, they know it.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  It's the old joke of crazy cat lady.
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  2 million people.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  Here's another one, National Geographic.
[07:39.000 --> 07:45.000]  Meet 5 zombie parasites that mind control their host.
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.000]  Now, why am I mentioning this?
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  Because this ties into something much, much, much, much bigger
[07:57.000 --> 08:03.000]  than I will cover coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  But it ties into Apple to Fix FaceTime bug
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  that allows eavesdropping.
[08:10.000 --> 08:12.000]  Well, they built the back door in on purpose
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  so that anybody that's in the club, anybody that's in big tech
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  knows how to have that little leg up on folks.
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  It was private researchers that discovered the bug.
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  Of course, we told you specifically about it 10 years ago
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  when the iPhone came out with an exact article
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.000]  and even demonstrated it for you.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  That's why we've got to be rude from the air.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  Then it ties into this article.
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  Facebook pays teens to install VPN that spies on them,
[08:35.000 --> 08:43.000]  including audio and video, in a secret program.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  Now, I can get into why they're doing that,
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  but the point is this is all being done by design.
[08:49.000 --> 08:57.000]  By the time it becomes ubiquitous or like indoor running water
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  or central heating and cooling, once it's just accepted
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  as our environment, then they'll announce the next phase
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  of what it's really all designed to do.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  So that's just some of the news on that front
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.000]  we're going to be covering.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  Also, the Polar Vortex tightens its grip on Midwestern U.S. cities.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  Incredible satellite footage from above the Arctic
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  shows the huge swirling mass basically boiling down
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  from the Arctic right over the Midwest.
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  They're having to literally light the train tracks
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  on fire in Chicago to be able to keep the trains rolling
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.000]  over the tracks.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  That sounds insane.
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.000]  That's the Associated Press.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  Large areas of Minneapolis, St. Paul are without power.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  There's obviously already been death, people phrasing to death.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  This is the second coldest Arctic blast recorded
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  in the last 100 years.
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  But there is the literal footage of your TV viewer
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  of them setting the train tracks on fire
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  so the trains can roll over it.
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  There's a lot of reasons for that, but a larger reason is
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  you can get cold enough where if you try to roll trains down it
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  you can actually start shattering the metal
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  when you get 60, 70, 80 below freezing.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  We're going to be looking at that as it unfolds
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  a very, very serious situation, obviously.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  Now that said, we have Man Cal Muller who's been retired
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  for two years on his own accord, back on TV and radio.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  He's going to be popping in next segment.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  Then we are going to have the very informative.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  I'm really impressed with him.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  I mean, I know about his work for years,
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  but I'm talking to him for two hours at dinner last night.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  This guy knows his stuff, not just about law,
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  but about history, the world, what's really going on.
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  This guy ought to host the show.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  Robert Barnes representing many of the young people
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  from the Covington Catholic High School
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  will be in studio running shotgun with us for two hours today.
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.000]  So that's coming up as well.
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.000]  I also have mentioned this, but I think Tucker Carlson
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  knocked it out of the park again.
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  So I'm going to play it later in the hour.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  Perfect. Tucker covers Learn to Code meme
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  and Twitter's ensuing crackdown.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  You see, they don't ban stuff that's calling for violence
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  or that's truly racist that causes division.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  The left wants all that.
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  What they ban are things that are funny and make sense
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  and score political points because the left is always saying
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  about farmers or steelworkers or auto mechanics
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  or machine shop folks or coal miners.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  Oh, don't worry.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  I've been hearing this since the days of Bill Clinton.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  Learn to code.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  Learn to code.
[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  I remember being in high school when they were telling us
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  about the future economy and we need to learn to code.
[12:06.000 --> 12:10.000]  And so when you had thousands of layoffs, hundreds at BuzzFeed,
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  it's thousands of people laid off the last month
[12:12.000 --> 12:15.000]  at the big establishment leftist publications
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  because the censorship's here.
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  So since they've knocked out their competition,
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  what the left didn't get was once you've knocked out
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  all your right wing and libertarian
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  and Christian competition online predominantly,
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  you're not needed anymore in the information ward, dum-dums.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  So you allow total censorship to come in, then the war's over.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  At least the globalists think that to a certain extent.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  So it's all over for the unknown soldier.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  So they're having massive pay cuts and huge layoffs everywhere.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  Newspapers, mainstream establishment media, everywhere.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  And if somebody's got a big contract to pay out,
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  like Charlie Rose or others,
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  well, then those old sexual harassment cases,
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  they got swept under the rug years ago.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  Those get heated up and brought back.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  You can get rid of the head of CBS that way,
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  get rid of the head of NBC that way.
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.000]  That's all they're doing here.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  So they're imploding.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  And I just love all the little leftist mercenaries
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  who enjoyed interfacing with Google and Facebook and Twitter
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  and then censoring everybody.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  You're total fools.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  Even if you were cynical,
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  if you were Machiavelli,
[13:25.000 --> 13:31.000]  you'd know you wouldn't want to get rid of your opposition idiots.
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.000]  But again, leftists are known for having low IQs.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  That's why they're always talking about how smart they are,
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  because the real studies show you're a bunch of idiots
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  and you just don't get it.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  But you're going to get it in the final equation.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  Okay, we're going to go to Bright, come back with Mancow,
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  and then get into all this and more,
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  and then something really sickening.
[13:56.000 --> 13:59.000]  It's a powerful video upon Infowars.com.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  There's a couple powerful videos.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  But it's leftist introducing a bill similar to the one,
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  well, it's identical, the one that passed in New York,
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  to kill babies up until they're crowning and coming out of the womb.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  In fact, it says kill them once they're born.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  So it's on.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  And in this video, they're admitting it,
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  even some of the Democrats start scratching their heads going,
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  really?
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  Well, why?
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  The baby's being delivered.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  Why would you kill it?
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  Because they want to move on to Grandma,
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  and you listen to the eugenicists and others.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  They want to kill up kids at age three.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  That's where all this is going.
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  So that's a very important Paul Joseph Watson article
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  that will only get out if you get it out.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  But in the pro-life arena, we've been winning hearts and minds.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  The numbers are flipped now.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  The majority of young people are pro-life.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  We're going to win this fight, but let me tell you something.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  We can't be in an echo chamber where listeners think,
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  and I'm not bitching at you, I'm just saying, think about it.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  Oh, we already know all this, so let's not worry about it.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  No, you have to get articles like this with powerful video like this
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  and email it or text message it or print it off
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  and physically leave it inside a magazine
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  when you are at the barbershop or the beauty salon
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  or the dentist or at a restaurant.
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  Just dropping infowars.com verboten articles around
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  that cost you a few cents to print.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  If you just go in every day with just simple things like that
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  and just print, print, print, print a key article
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  that you think's important for your demographic, your area,
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  and then talk about it at the barbershop
[15:33.000 --> 15:35.000]  or slip it into a magazine
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  because people have heard the term infowars.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  And so they know it's verboten, so they'll read it
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  and that's how we win the war.
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  So powerful.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  Every little bit you do.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  But whatever you do, spread the live links to everybody you know.
[15:52.000 --> 16:04.000]  We'll be right back. Thanks for joining us.

[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  with the screen time and the extended hours
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive

[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  SuperMailVitality.com.
[19:59.000 --> 20:23.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:23.000 --> 20:27.000]  You're listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.000]  And we are back live.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[20:34.000 --> 20:37.000]  Before we go to Mankow and some important news here in a moment,
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  please do not forget that they're trying to censor us.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  They're trying to shut us down.
[20:43.000 --> 20:44.000]  And then once that precedent was set,
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  they started shutting everybody else down.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  Google's parent company Alphabet announced last week
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  was in publications everywhere.
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  It's in the local paper here in Austin three separate times
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  that don't worry, the cavalry's here.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  YouTube's going to ban all conspiracy theories.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  And the videos will not be searchable
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  and will not be recommended,
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  and you won't be able to find them.
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  That's called shadow banning.
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  Well, before YouTube was whatever was popular,
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  that voted at the front page.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  Now YouTube is whatever they want to force feed you.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  You can say, well, what's the big deal?
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  There's big studies out.
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  Generation of web addicts,
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  children spend more time on YouTube than with friends.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  This is the new communications medium.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  And then by gaming and controlling what's on it,
[21:29.000 --> 21:32.000]  it's no longer a free open square or a free square,
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  the term I'm coined,
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  it's no longer a free square,
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  it is a tyrannical forced fed system.
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  So please remember,
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  whether you're listening on AMFM or watching a TV station
[21:44.000 --> 21:47.000]  or on infowords.com, you are the real ambassadors.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  You're the hope to share the live video links,
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  to share articles, to share videos with everybody you know
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  on a regular basis to circumvent the algorithms
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  and the censorship.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  We built our own system, our own video platform.
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  We're taking it to them, we're fighting hard.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  And we're actually holding the line
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  while others get shut down
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  or go bankrupt, including corporate media.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  Now joining us is ManCal.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  ManCal Muller, good friend of mine.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  He took off about a year and a half
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  to be in some big movies with Bruce Willis
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  and others and spend time with his family
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  and travel the world.
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  We've been having some great long conversations off air.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  He's hosting another radio slash TV program again
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  out of Chicago that's already becoming a hit
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  here in just the last few weeks.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  And I wanted him to pop in one of many
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  future interviews where he's going to be here,
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  whether it's hopefully via Skype,
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  just to give us his view on the current state of the world
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  and all the big issues, and as a father
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  and as a broadcaster being out of the limelight
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  and having some time to actually sit back
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  for almost two years,
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  what his perspective is right now.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  So ManCal, thanks so much for joining us.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  Well, it wasn't two years.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  It was a year, but it was incredible.
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  Look, I've been doing my stupid shows
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  since the mid-80s.
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  My radio station, probably the greatest
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  rock and roll radio station.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  Well, one of the greatest, if not the greatest,
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  rock and roll radio stations.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  The Loop went out of business,
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  told off to Christian broadcasters,
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  which I was fine with.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  And I didn't miss it, man.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  I didn't miss the stupidity of radio.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  Well, it seems like two years.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  I guess, but you had two gigs two years ago.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  You quit one, and then, I guess,
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  a year later you got rid of the other one.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  But you just told me you've traveled the world.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  You've seen a lot of wild stuff.
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  Well, I mean, I probably the highlighter
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  that one of the most exciting things was,
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.000]  you know, traveling around Korea,
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  North Korea and having a sub come up next to me on the boat.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  That was pretty terrifying.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  A military submarine come up next to me.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  But, you know, Alex,
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  you really learned what the world thinks of us.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  You know, everything that we're rejecting
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  is what the world loves about us.
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  And what I'm talking about is
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  our Wild West attitude,
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  the Clint Eastwoods,
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  the John Wayne,
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  the no BS attitude that we have,
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  the fact that we love truth and justice,
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  that we are clear cut with our opinions.
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  And, you know, the world is just so bizarre
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  because the world is learning that socialism doesn't work
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  and communism doesn't work.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  And, you know, I was in Prague, I was in Budapest,
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  and they love our freedom.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  And yet, here we are just pushing that away.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  It's quite insane, really.
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  I mean, talk to any cab driver anywhere in America.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  And, you know, these guys from the Eastern Bloc countries,
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  they can't believe it.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  They got out of that oppression,
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  and they are debating whether or not to have socialism
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  and communism in America.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  So, it's fascinating.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  I really think everyone should leave America,
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  not permanently.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  No, you only leave America permanently
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  if the presidency doesn't go the way you want, right?
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  The liberals are always saying they're going to leave America.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  They never do.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  But, you know, it's important to leave America,
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  and this goes back to early American literature, right?
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  You have to leave America to appreciate America,
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  to see kind of where we're steering off the cliff.
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  Well, I think you hit the central point.
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  The whole world has had three or four rounds
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  in the last 150 years of socialism and communism.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  It never works, except for the elites that are robbing the people.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  You travel the world.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  They love the ideal and the iconography
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  and the art type of America,
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  but that's exactly what Hollywood
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  and the corporate establishment is attacking.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  What makes us strong? What makes us sexy?
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  What made people want to come here to begin with?
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  You know, you're doing that as the entire raft
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  of democratic candidates,
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  say, free health care, free tuition, free everything,
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  when just free health care is bigger than the whole federal budget.
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  Well, you know, Alex, you know, just quickly,
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  I'm hoping you can help me with the answer.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  I don't quite get it.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  And the social justice warring, I mean,
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  let's look at even, I know you talked about it,
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  but just Star Wars or anything,
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Mary Poppins,
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  and I had on the guys that wrote Mary Poppins,
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  the two songwriters, the Sherman brothers,
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  you know, just brilliant guys
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  and, you know, simple stuff,
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  and we used to be able to do innocence.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  We used to be able to do beauty.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  We used to be able to do the American way.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  Everything has to have some nasty message.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Like, kids' television is like,
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  oh, like, perverted.
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  It's sick.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  You know, Alex, it's,
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  I mean, I think about Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  yeah, there was the child catcher or Willy Wonka,
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  it was scary,
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  but we can't do innocent and sweet anymore.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  Yeah, I have little kids
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  and you take your kids to a cartoon
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  and there's always a message,
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  there's always some kind of sexual thing
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  that they've got to be taught,
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  and it's just awful.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  And so, you know,
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  our movies, our music,
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  let's listen to our music.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  It's no wonder.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  Look, they're not racist.
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  America's not racist.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  We elected Barack Obama.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  But listen to the violence
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  and the misogynistic crap.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  And, you know,
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  I'll tell you something else traveled in the world.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  There's borders.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  And you have to be,
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  but everywhere you go, you get checked.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  And I don't see anything wrong
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  with America having borders.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  And the world doesn't either.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  And when you get down with the people,
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  we're not talking about the media elite,
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  but when you sit, man, they love,
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  they love Donald Trump.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  Now, the people on TV don't,
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  the Angela Merkels don't.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  Do you really think she's Hitler's daughter?
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  I don't know, but she might as well be
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  because the EU was,
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  it was Hitler's plan.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  But that's what I see in Europe.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  That's what my parents go to Europe a lot.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  They go every year and they say
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  people are on fire loving Donald Trump
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  and loving Americana.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  And they went out from under the globalist as well.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  And the good news is you see the yellow vest,
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  you see Merkel being booed with McCron.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  But then they're so arrogant,
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  they just keep moving forward with this program
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  to open the borders up to radical Islam.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  It's crazy.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  I had just a beautiful time.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  Have you ever toured the Christmas villages?
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  Have you ever done that?
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  No, I've not had a chance to be in Germany
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  in places around Christmas.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  Well, I did.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  I mean, this is really what the time off was.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  Well, we still can.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  And of course, the one was attacked by Islam,
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  Islamic kooks.
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  It was part of no known ideology.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  But that one in Germany was attacked.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  And I had little kids and I was nervous,
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  but I was somewhat.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  But I hit all the Christmas markets.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  I went through Prague and Budapest
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  and Germany and Vienna.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  And it goes on and on.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  And we were in Salzburg
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  and we went to the sound of music.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  We went on the sound of music.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  Hold on. Here's when we come back.
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  I want to get into the last of Christendom.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  See it while it's still last.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  And I'll get into censorship with Mandkal.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  He's famously been censoring himself
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  and where he thinks he's going.
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  Learn how to get sober after we've shared these stories.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  I was 35 with two beautiful children
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  After my divorce,
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  I went into a depression cycle
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  and started drinking more often
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  and using prescription drugs.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  After my second DWI and arrest,
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  my ex-husband threatened to take
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  our children away from me.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  I was 17 when I became addicted
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  to heroin and meth.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  I thought I could quit on my own,
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  but I couldn't.
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  Get sober now.
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  Your private insurance may cover costs
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  and we'll get you here. It's simple.

[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  Please, don't wait.
[29:42.000 --> 30:06.000]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[30:06.000 --> 30:08.000]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  can give you a short boost,
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  trash can leave you more tired than ever.

[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[31:00.000 --> 31:02.000]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  There is no set stasis.
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  There is no managed system.
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.420]  There is no
[31:10.420 --> 31:12.480]  in and in form.
[31:12.480 --> 31:14.480]  Continue on.
[31:14.480 --> 31:16.480]  Uncontinuum is always launching forward in the future.
[31:20.480 --> 31:22.480]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[31:22.480 --> 31:24.480]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[31:24.480 --> 31:26.480]  We'll be here forever.
[31:26.480 --> 31:28.480]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[31:28.480 --> 31:30.480]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases
[31:30.480 --> 31:32.640]  are going to look back and say,
[31:32.640 --> 31:34.640]  we struggled here, we made it,
[31:34.640 --> 31:38.560]  other stuff because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build
[31:38.560 --> 31:42.120]  things and are also ready to fight. You don't go to the next level without getting
[31:42.120 --> 31:44.800]  a big weight put on your back and I mean I don't know what's gonna happen to me
[31:44.800 --> 31:49.400]  in the future. I mean all I know is I want to go with the master built. I want
[31:49.400 --> 31:53.680]  to go to the next level. I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced not
[31:53.680 --> 31:57.560]  these devil worshipers. They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb. I
[31:57.560 --> 32:02.880]  want life. I want Jesus. Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it
[32:02.880 --> 32:07.800]  really is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani estates but a lot of us
[32:07.800 --> 32:12.040]  on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and
[32:12.040 --> 32:17.960]  acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could
[32:17.960 --> 32:22.800]  lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out we employed a series
[32:22.800 --> 32:28.720]  of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in
[32:28.720 --> 32:33.600]  fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next we
[32:33.600 --> 32:37.880]  tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the
[32:37.880 --> 32:43.140]  heavy metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal
[32:43.140 --> 32:48.720]  levels. As it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[32:48.720 --> 32:53.400]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[32:53.400 --> 32:58.280]  rainwater supply. But more importantly a good water filtration system will
[32:58.280 --> 33:00.840]  purify it.
[33:02.480 --> 33:07.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:17.560 --> 33:25.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[33:25.160 --> 33:31.120]  resistance. Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[33:32.680 --> 33:40.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Alright Eric Manchel Muller is on the
[33:40.200 --> 33:46.480]  line with us. He's been off for a year hiatus. We talked like 30 minutes the other
[33:46.480 --> 33:50.240]  day about all the amazing stuff he saw travel the world. I want him to recount
[33:50.240 --> 33:54.400]  some of that but then I just thought during the break he's in Chicago they're
[33:54.400 --> 34:03.600]  having to set the railways on fire to de-ice it where at 6070 below powers out
[34:03.600 --> 34:08.000]  in parts of Minneapolis St. Paul in Minnesota this huge record Arctic
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.080]  blast they say one the strongest in a hundred years how's that for global
[34:12.080 --> 34:14.960]  warming. So we'll get back to your Christmas story that we're getting into
[34:14.960 --> 34:17.920]  about through the Christmas markets have to put up these barriers so these
[34:17.920 --> 34:21.600]  llamas don't target it and run it over with these hundreds of attacks but
[34:21.600 --> 34:27.360]  first off the Arctic blast how are you handling that. You know a bit of a bit
[34:27.360 --> 34:30.880]  of trouble starting my truck this morning but you know look I go inside it's
[34:30.880 --> 34:36.000]  these guys standing outside it's cold outside I've never understood that we're
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.720]  not morons it's Chicago we expect the cold we expect the snow constantly
[34:41.720 --> 34:44.600]  reminded that we should bring pets inside and I guess people really are
[34:44.600 --> 34:48.840]  stupid but it seems to me you would know to bring your dog and cat in I don't
[34:48.840 --> 34:52.880]  know but it's just everywhere you turn it's bring your dog and cat in and and
[34:52.880 --> 34:57.520]  wear a coat really it's 40 blow with the windshield really wear a coat are we
[34:57.520 --> 35:01.800]  that stupid and of course I heard you're talking to
[35:01.800 --> 35:06.120]  getting all those water filters for my kids and you know they're really we're
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.960]  starting to really find out how polluted Chicago water is which explains our
[35:09.960 --> 35:14.480]  political system here it's you know loaded with lead and just zombies man
[35:14.480 --> 35:19.960]  just the land of living dead here in the in the middle of America remember all
[35:19.960 --> 35:23.840]  those years ago I might try to toot my horn but I would come on your show 10
[35:23.840 --> 35:28.520]  12 13 years ago talk about your your your phones are spying on you your iPhones
[35:28.520 --> 35:32.480]  are watching you now it's all admitted I think that's why they had to take me off
[35:32.480 --> 35:36.760]  the internet in many areas is because the credibility had gone so high and how
[35:36.760 --> 35:39.720]  they had to then brand me as the Sandy Hook denier that isn't even really the
[35:39.720 --> 35:43.240]  case that's out of context just to make it all about that but they're since
[35:43.240 --> 35:47.600]  during a lot of other people now from Franklin Grand to and culture it's
[35:47.600 --> 35:51.760]  getting a lot worse but you were one of the first people massively censored for
[35:51.760 --> 35:55.480]  doing nothing but for having hit radio show across the Contrano and Clinton
[35:55.480 --> 35:58.040]  came to town once they threatened actually take you off the air if you
[35:58.040 --> 36:01.640]  talked about about Clinton and actually Secret Service puts you in the puts you
[36:01.640 --> 36:04.440]  in the armored limo and threatens you maybe you can recount that story but
[36:04.440 --> 36:08.640]  what do you make of I know you've had a rivalry with him not your rivalry it's
[36:08.640 --> 36:13.840]  it's his Howard Stern claiming he's Mr. Free Speech he's gone on air now and
[36:13.840 --> 36:17.920]  said I deserve to be taken off the air everywhere it's good to ban me and then
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.240]  he says these lies about me and has impersonators on making fun of dead
[36:22.240 --> 36:26.680]  kids and I just wonder how Howard Stern has turned into Mr. Anti-Free Speech
[36:26.680 --> 36:30.760]  it's pretty sick well he's controlled by source and the rest of them right he's
[36:30.760 --> 36:34.960]  part he is the system man he's part of the system it's like expecting Hillary
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.520]  to change something or the system to change the system protects the
[36:39.520 --> 36:45.520]  system brother and I've always known this guy's a wig wearing fake and by the
[36:45.520 --> 36:51.280]  way he never beat me he never beat me and you can I mean going back to the
[36:51.280 --> 36:54.720]  smoking gun but all the files I have it's been there was a book out about it
[36:54.720 --> 37:01.840]  and this guy had one big fear and that was me and he sent me a dress and we
[37:01.840 --> 37:07.160]  all um I don't know I don't want to be gross here but we we left something in
[37:07.160 --> 37:12.320]  the in the it's what you would serve somebody on the shingle and we filled
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.600]  that box back up and sent it to him and I just punched him in the nose he's a
[37:16.600 --> 37:21.800]  bully and he thought he could he could shout me down while he lost and the
[37:21.800 --> 37:24.280]  guy's a creep last I heard what when there's something sorry about his
[37:24.280 --> 37:27.520]  daughter spinning around on a pole let me tell you something Alex I know you
[37:27.520 --> 37:32.080]  you've had a tough time you know you've been going through just hell I can't
[37:32.080 --> 37:35.240]  believe what they put you through but if your daughter ends up spinning around a
[37:35.240 --> 37:40.520]  pole you lose I was on the set of America's Got Talent and Stern saw me
[37:40.520 --> 37:46.480]  and he ran he ran I was hanging out with that spice girl and he ran there's

[38:14.720 --> 38:18.080]  what happened he started wanting to have me on the show so I did it and I went on
[38:18.080 --> 38:21.000]  some of their other shows and they would literally get on the phone and say now
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.120]  you're not gonna mention man-cow are you well we used to like the fact you know
[38:24.120 --> 38:28.200]  man-cow and I'm like I'm a talk show host I go another shows I do like man-cow

[38:43.200 --> 38:49.200]  a sense of humor how funny you are and you know it is you are trying to do an
[38:49.200 --> 38:54.080]  entertaining show this is what they didn't get this about Raj I think don't
[38:54.080 --> 38:57.040]  mar I don't agree with them politically but I think he tries to be entertaining
[38:57.040 --> 39:02.040]  so many of these people that like Saturday night live it's not funny it's
[39:02.040 --> 39:05.800]  mean and you were talking about I didn't believe about I didn't believe this I
[39:05.800 --> 39:11.400]  didn't believe that you talk about I mean you and I've had arguments battles
[39:11.400 --> 39:14.880]  sometimes over a bottle of wine sitting in Austin or heading out to the Museum
[39:14.880 --> 39:19.320]  of the Weird and and hanging out and I I hate to admit how often I've been wrong
[39:19.320 --> 39:23.280]  I don't my listeners to know this how often I've been wrong and how often you
[39:23.280 --> 39:26.720]  haven't right so it's just amazing you never get the credit when you're right
[39:26.720 --> 39:32.240]  you talked about surveillance glimpse and it was I was slapping my knee you
[39:32.240 --> 39:37.320]  talked about the pedophiles with the elite and and you know the connection
[39:37.320 --> 39:41.000]  with the children entertainers in England the connection with the directors
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.920]  in Hollywood and hardy horror man I was slapping my knee that crazy Alex Jones
[39:46.920 --> 39:52.080]  and good night Irene if you weren't right brother and and then that survey
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.640]  remember that surveillance blimp crashed yes and you called me you go you go hey I
[39:56.640 --> 40:01.160]  thought they didn't have surveillance blips well they're so high the average
[40:01.160 --> 40:04.040]  person can't even see there about a hundred thousand feet let me ask you
[40:04.040 --> 40:08.960]  this because yeah you've been right about a lot of stuff as well and you're
[40:08.960 --> 40:13.400]  right I mean society is breaking down children spend more time in front of
[40:13.400 --> 40:16.840]  computers than with friends or parents there's got to be a breaking point where
[40:16.840 --> 40:22.480]  you see civilization going oh god brother I have children you have children
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.360]  and if you and I didn't have kids how different will we live I don't think
[40:27.360 --> 40:30.040]  you'd be doing this radio show if you didn't have kids man you love your kids
[40:30.040 --> 40:37.000]  Alex Jones loves his kids I love my kids and I I don't know man I don't I don't

[40:41.840 --> 40:47.280]  Salzburg with my kids we went to all the sound of music sites and there had been
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.960]  an attack two days earlier in Germany an Islamic attack and this very liberal
[40:51.960 --> 40:54.640]  woman that was taking us around I could tell she was liberal we talked about a
[40:54.640 --> 40:58.040]  few things she said you know we're and we're sitting there in the freezing
[40:58.040 --> 41:03.240]  cold and all these little handmade little cuckoo clocks and we're going back

[41:07.920 --> 41:12.600]  more thing and you know the handmade manger and all of this and you know
[41:12.600 --> 41:17.800]  something China I want I'm going to get to the point of story Alex I hate this
[41:17.800 --> 41:22.040]  and you probably do as a radio host when we just say this China Japan Korea you
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.040]  see more Christmas than you do in America we're so worried about offending
[41:26.040 --> 41:29.280]  people anyway so I'm at this little Christmas market in Salzburg this
[41:29.280 --> 41:33.040]  liberal lady's talking to me she says you know we've always been open to the
[41:33.040 --> 41:36.280]  Eastern Bloc people under communism everybody was welcome in Vienna
[41:36.280 --> 41:40.440]  everybody was welcome and but we're beginning to see that it's not really
[41:40.440 --> 41:45.200]  young but these people are lying they're not playing political oppression that
[41:45.200 --> 41:50.120]  it's an invasion and we really they're coming from you know warm climates into
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.400]  our area here and they're here to destroy us we're really starting and she was
[41:54.400 --> 41:59.760]  like I was all for it but we're really seeing that it is Islam is is on the

[47:05.000 --> 47:07.840]  jones show
[47:07.840 --> 47:26.440]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones you know
[47:26.440 --> 47:31.840]  there are countless monuments huge paintings historical books written
[47:31.840 --> 47:37.040]  about the hundreds of times that Islam invaded Europe fact they took what is
[47:37.040 --> 47:44.280]  Turkey today that was Constantinople now it's their capital there it's Istanbul
[47:44.280 --> 47:49.000]  and they got to the Vatican they took over Rome they would take the women put
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.080]  them into sex slavery and so there's a lot of paintings a lot of history on
[47:53.080 --> 47:57.920]  that and and now the average Muslim that comes in understands that history
[47:57.920 --> 48:02.440]  understands that there is inside the house of Islam and outside the house of
[48:02.440 --> 48:06.200]  Islam is war that's why there aren't really any Muslim nations you can go to
[48:06.200 --> 48:11.560]  where Christians even practice their faith without being killed so you were
[48:11.560 --> 48:15.400]  getting into as we hit the break how you were being driven around by this
[48:15.400 --> 48:18.920]  German liberal lady who was no longer liberal she's like oh yes you know we
[48:18.920 --> 48:22.320]  were all come in we love you but they don't assimilate they hate us they
[48:22.320 --> 48:25.560]  attack us they have to put up freedom barriers are all these public places
[48:25.560 --> 48:30.680]  because the big truck attacks it's it's an alliance by the deep state by the
[48:30.680 --> 48:33.160]  EU with radical Islam so you were finishing up with that and then you
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.360]  had one more story about how it's turned just understand how it's turned he
[48:37.360 --> 48:42.680]  does have 20 some writers he reads off a teleprompter that's in his desk and he
[48:42.680 --> 48:47.400]  just he goes on air and constantly lies about me and says things I never said
[48:47.400 --> 48:51.720]  and says I deserve to be off the air when he has Nambla members on coming out
[48:51.720 --> 48:55.280]  they won't have sex with people's kids he and he has Nazis on to the most foul
[48:55.280 --> 48:58.760]  stuff you know what he has free speech you can do it he then lies and says I'm
[48:58.760 --> 49:02.200]  sending people to Sandy Hook families like I've never played this audio he
[49:02.200 --> 49:07.800]  has he plays my show's music he has an impersonator on it's done so well
[49:07.800 --> 49:12.400]  people call thinking it's me on there going birthday time for the Sandy Hook
[49:12.400 --> 49:16.840]  kids and all this and then I get death threats over it and he won't stop doing
[49:16.840 --> 49:21.720]  it so he gets the orders he does it and everybody calls me saying yeah you know
[49:21.720 --> 49:25.520]  it shows very small pretty we speed still has a big following yeah he's on
[49:25.520 --> 49:30.120]  there all the time saying no free speech for you so it just he it's it's it and
[49:30.120 --> 49:34.680]  you know they've it's just to see that is very very disconcerting man Cal but I
[49:34.680 --> 49:38.320]  know I know you've disliked him for a long time and didn't make fun of your dad
[49:38.320 --> 49:42.800]  when he died or something listen I look quick I just want to say I don't care
[49:42.800 --> 49:45.840]  if someone's Islamic but I don't think we should have to give up what we are I
[49:45.840 --> 49:50.400]  I'm all about freedom I'm all about him doing his awful show and you can do your
[49:50.400 --> 49:55.200]  show and I could do my show that's freedom that's what freedom is and you
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.960]  know look I she will punch somebody that does something to the flag but hey
[49:59.960 --> 50:04.160]  man are we gonna have freedom or not being a Christian the things that I see
[50:04.160 --> 50:10.240]  on a daily basis the offensive stuff that I see but man that's freedom so for
[50:10.240 --> 50:18.320]  him to call for your ending is is horrible we we had a meeting along with
[50:18.320 --> 50:21.280]  opening Anthony and there they're just a brother they're just bottom of the
[50:21.280 --> 50:27.160]  barrel they have no opinion their scumbags there it's built I'm sorry but
[50:27.160 --> 50:32.640]  showing a breast of a woman is not shocking or dangerous speaking against
[50:32.640 --> 50:39.200]  power putting everything on the line like you have is that's shocking that's
[50:39.200 --> 50:43.720]  risky I mean I'm a family guy that likes to take my kids to church on Sunday
[50:43.720 --> 50:49.440]  that's that's ugly and offensive to much of the world my father made $30,000 a
[50:49.440 --> 50:54.320]  year as a cabinet salesman and when he died Howard Stern did a bit where he had
[50:54.320 --> 50:59.120]  a funeral for my dad and he dug up the corpse and he raped it he raped my
[50:59.120 --> 51:03.440]  father's corpse on the day of his funeral and then he used saliva from my
[51:03.440 --> 51:08.600]  mother's mouth for a lubricant and then he had sex with her and everybody in
[51:08.600 --> 51:15.240]  Chicago went this is a vile evil human being and and that was the end of him
[51:15.240 --> 51:20.360]  he never got a foothold in Chicago and his career died here because we're not
[51:20.360 --> 51:25.360]  ugly like that and so I don't know what kind of person listens to that but they
[51:25.360 --> 51:28.920]  can have it probably the same kind of people that cheers here on Rachel Maddow
[51:28.920 --> 51:34.520]  and think that's news morons I was about to say there's a very pedophilic vein
[51:34.520 --> 51:39.680]  through his show when you actually look at it and you see that in Hollywood and
[51:39.680 --> 51:41.720]  I just think at the end of the day and that's what we're dealing with here at
[51:41.720 --> 51:46.600]  the bottom of the spider hole is a system that wants to abuse children you
[51:46.600 --> 51:51.160]  know the high-fiving I can't say it you know the high-fiving kind the hike the
[51:51.160 --> 51:56.880]  stupid the guy that's 30 years old thinks it's cool that he's got a beer in his
[51:56.880 --> 52:04.960]  hand yeah I got a beer I mean just stupid mouth breathing violent vile that
[52:04.960 --> 52:09.960]  that's his crowd and I don't care and it doesn't surprise me he wants you shut
[52:09.960 --> 52:13.960]  down because he wants everyone shut down that that's a threat to him and
[52:13.960 --> 52:19.920]  frankly anyone with any talent is a threat by the way Joe Big sent me this
[52:19.920 --> 52:26.120]  audio a few weeks ago I never played it on air and I should play it because other
[52:26.120 --> 52:29.920]  people told me about he keeps doing it where he has a character on and the guy
[52:29.920 --> 52:33.680]  does a good impersonation of me and actually says what I say word for word
[52:33.680 --> 52:37.800]  but then mixes in horrible things in the middle of it and you say oh it's a joke
[52:37.800 --> 52:40.360]  but they know a lot like Colbert and all these other people that are political
[52:40.360 --> 52:46.640]  now they go oh it's just a joke but then they say I'm in the KKK and Colbert does
[52:46.640 --> 52:51.040]  bits where I put mayonnaise on my head because I'm in the KKK well people then
[52:51.040 --> 52:55.240]  really believe I'm in the KKK so they really know what they're doing mixing
[52:55.240 --> 53:04.080]  these so-called comedy venues with fake news man go Alex brother I'm in
[53:04.080 --> 53:09.920]  Chicago I run I don't run into anyone wearing Colbert shirts I run into people
[53:09.920 --> 53:14.240]  all the time with Alex Jones and Info War shirts they're not looking for me I

[53:52.880 --> 53:55.600]  front of fraud in fact I found the audio I don't know this will translate over

[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:22.880]  so if you're an establishment shill like Howard Stern you can get up there and
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.360]  make fun of dead sanny hood kids all day the media praises you for as long as
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:32.000]  you're doing it my name then you're fine but if you're really exposing the fact
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.200]  that Google and Apple and others are moving to China helping to press their
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:38.880]  own people transferring US technology well then you get taken off air you get
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.600]  blocked and that's what's happening Twitter doesn't take you off of your
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.640]  ISIS or Al Qaeda or you're creating racial division they have a civil rights
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.960]  lawyers famous represented a lot of black folks who are actually persecuted
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.160]  come on later and he'll break that down that the establishment funds cases and
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:02.200]  groups that are divisive not cases where it's a slam dunk that somebody was
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:08.280]  actually abused for a racial reason so that's coming up with our next guest in
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:13.640]  the studio but I wanted to play a clip from this very powerful Tucker Carlson
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:18.880]  piece that's up on info wars.com and news wars.com that really needs to be
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.320]  shared because Twitter has begun banning people banning them not just
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.640]  freezing their account that respond to any public figure leftist journalist with
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:34.920]  learn to code meme now they're not doing it because it's a hate symbol or
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.560]  whatever the left defines it as they're doing it because it's the truth and it's
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.120]  effective and it's what they told us about the service economy for the last
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.040]  30 years while we were being purposely deindustrialized so Tucker does a great
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:52.880]  job but the last piece of the equation is they're banning it because it's witty
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:02:00.080]  it's common sense it makes sense and these little snowflakes that are in this
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.520]  authoritarian system can't handle somebody giving them their own medicine
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.520]  back so here is that clip from last night's Tucker Carlson. Well the past
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.920]  couple weeks were pretty awful for American journalists hundreds of
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.560]  reporters and editors at places like Huffington Post and Buzzfeed lost their
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:22.240]  jobs victims of systemic changes to their industry no matter what you think of
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.760]  those sites it's sad anyone who's lost his job knows it's very tough now those
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.040]  journalists suddenly have a lot in common with millions of other Americans
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:35.880]  factory workers loggers retail clerks coal miners all of them and many more
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:39.920]  have seen their way of life disappear thanks to technology or outsourcing or
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.000]  private equity this kind of thing has been going on a long time now in
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.920]  previous cycles what we used to call creative destruction journalists had
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.000]  ready advice for newly unemployed blue collar workers just learn to code
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.720]  coding is the future stop whining and embrace it here's a selection of
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.400]  headlines you might remember on that subject this one's from NPR from coal
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:06.040]  to code a new path for laid-off miners in Kentucky from wired the tech of
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:11.680]  Angela's magazine can you teach a coal miner to code from CBS News out of work
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.040]  coal miners find new work in computer industry and this from Bloomberg
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.640]  Appalachian miners are learning to code and from the venerable New York Times
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.880]  the coders of Kentucky see it's that simple let's say you spent 30 years
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.680]  making a solid middle-class living in a paper mill in northern New Hampshire then
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.600]  one day the mill shuts down sold for scrap to China happened a lot but no
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.280]  problem just want to code everyone in Brooklyn's doing it well coding was
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.200]  never a real solution to any of this obviously but it had the effect of
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.880]  making journalists feel even more self-satisfied and of course that was the
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:50.520]  point it's always the point actually fast forward to this month someone on
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.320]  Twitter came up with a pretty brilliant piece of advice for all those laid-off
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.720]  journalists trying to figure out what to do with their lives learn to code
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:03.600]  perfect suddenly learn to code was everywhere on Twitter but journalists
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:07.240]  didn't see the humor in this at all a former New Yorker employee called Talia
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.560]  Lavin called the phrase quote far right hate people who went to Wesley and
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:17.320]  shouldn't have to learn to code so they complained to the censorship authorities
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.480]  at Twitter who immediately concluded that asking someone to learn to code it
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.720]  might be quote targeted harassment but only when it's directed at people who
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:32.320]  used to work at Buzzfeed for the paper mill guy in New Hampshire coding is
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.520]  still a future and let's be clear Twitter especially in Facebook as well
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:42.320]  are bullying reeducation camp digital brainwashing centers so they all gang
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.280]  up they all bully that's all encouraged but if you organize back with
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.960]  something witty to them that they've used on you well now you're banned it's
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:05:01.080]  all a rigged system for cowards to bully and attack that's what the left is when
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.040]  it comes to rebuilding your energy convenience is key while coffee candy
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.800]  and other sugary products can give you a short boost the crash can leave you

[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:48.400]  hour and writing shotgun for the rest of the broadcast today's Robert Barnes the
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.080]  trial lawyer he wins high-profile cases for clients and civil criminal and
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.280]  constitutional law was featured in the UK Times and AP is America's most
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.520]  successful political gambler Robert Barnes has vowed to sue the reporters and
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.280]  celebrities who have perpetuated the false statements and attacked the Covington
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:08.360]  high school students in fact guys queue up the clip if you can the full clip where
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.960]  he gets where Bill Maher gets into the attack on a play that he's also given
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.600]  them 48 hours to retract and apologize that now was last week after which we
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:21.800]  will begin filing defamation lawsuits so it's great to have you here in town
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.520]  thanks for coming to town absolutely glad to be here well I had a great time
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:28.640]  last night at dinner with you us comparing notes just about how the world
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.680]  really works the whole fake civil rights movement because I know you've been
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.480]  involved in civil rights movement and where you see the whole world going so
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.240]  in part two of the interview next hour we should get more into that and just
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.600]  where you see this country the world going but the latest update on the
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.120]  story still captivating people's attention the attempted frame up by the
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.520]  media and leftist groups of the Covington high school students that you
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.840]  represent absolutely so what we are sending out this week are intent to sue
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.320]  letters that are going to be demand letters that no longer can they just
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.120]  simply delete or correct or apologize they have to take further remedial action
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.640]  they can delete their account they can pin a tweet that says what they did said
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.920]  was wrong about the Covington kids they can propose other settlement terms but
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.080]  that those will be the terms that will be sent out this week and if they don't
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.440]  remedy it within a week they don't come up with some sort of settlement solution
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:20.240]  that is satisfactory to the family that protects these families kids moving
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.360]  forward then the net effect is going to be they're going to be sued and sooner
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.960]  later they're going to face a Covington judge and then a Covington jury why was
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.560]  this an important case to you and why do you think it captured people's
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:34.640]  attention so much because it really was as the president said as I noticed it
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.120]  was a tipping point where people really got how fake and how organized mainstream
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.840]  news is to put out unified deception absolutely I mean what it is is it's
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.480]  really sort of this last vestige of that's outside of the cultural mind
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.760]  control of the left so the left overwhelmingly has influence in the
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.520]  entertainment industry in the educational industry most university
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.240]  faculty are to the left most public education teachers are to the left most
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:01.600]  of Hollywood is to the left most of the mainstream media is to the left so they
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.640]  have so much of the control of the means by which we shape people's minds in the
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.240]  in the country and in the world one of the few places left that's a pushback
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.960]  against that other than other than people like yourself Alex are Christian
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.840]  schools little evangelical schools little Catholic schools across the country
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.600]  that are teaching traditional values traditional ideas traditional ideals
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.200]  respecting the sort of tradition of empiricism that the Western educational
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.000]  structure little islands of sanity sanity and wholesomeness exactly that's
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.920]  exactly what it is and that's the end if so offends the institutional left and
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:36.720]  the mindset left and the and the mind control left that their obsession is
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.040]  we have to suppress it we have to shame it we have to censor it we have to
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:44.560]  repress it and they chose a bunch of kids kids going to Washington DC who are
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.760]  just enamored with being in the nation's capital enamored with this
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.120]  opportunity to express their political beliefs to participate in one of the
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.720]  greatest American democratic experiments the world's democratic
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.640]  experiments ever and they're the ones targeted with this campaign meant to
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.880]  censor them and meant to shame them and not only that meant to scare and
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.280]  terrorize everybody like them anywhere in the world and Democrat members of
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.240]  Congress days after it happened saying ban the red hat ban people under the age
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.240]  of 18 wearing it such open authoritarianism when they knew good and
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.920]  well that the quote elder is a political activist he'd marched over tried to
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.720]  cause a confrontation the kids had already moved once away if you watch the
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.080]  full 30 minute video trying to get away from them they were waiting for their
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.920]  bus but the whole media said that no they were impeding the poor native who
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:34.760]  just tried to walk up the stairs that poor baby when mainstream media had the
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:39.760]  full clip took us five minutes to find it that Saturday and to say look at this
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.720]  incredible setup so it's this concerted bullying and almost all these kids some
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.560]  look like they're 10 years old they were so innocent they were jumping up and
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.280]  down with the drumbeat they were having fun and then mainstream media lies and
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.760]  says that they were saying build that wall and or saying you know we can rape
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.080]  women if we want members of Congress have put tweets out saying they were
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.920]  saying we're allowed to rape people just bizarre insane garbage precisely I mean
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.000]  you look at what happened these kids are being taunted by this grapple group of
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.800]  black Hebrew Israelites who are calling them cracker who are actually also
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.400]  making fun of the Native Americans in the area calling them Uncle Tomahawk all
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.200]  of these racist references these kids don't try to get into a fight with them
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.800]  don't try to dispute them don't try to question them instead all they try to do
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.120]  is hey let's do some school cheers and part of their school cheers is the Haka
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.800]  which is one of the great tribal dances anywhere in the world and doing the
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.240]  Haka isn't disrespect it's respect it's honor it's one of the tribal traditions
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.960]  of the Hori tribe from New Zealand and from South Australia and other parts
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.240]  around the sort of the Tahitian world all the way up through there and they do
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.400]  the New Zealand rugby band the rugby team does it every game they sort of
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.120]  invite their competition to come out and they do their Haka and they're called
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.600]  the all blacks for the New Zealand rugby team and it's a great tradition that's
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.400]  one of the greatest sports dances of any kind in the world here they are doing
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:03.600]  this and not long after that they see a Native American come up with a drum so
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.560]  they think he's participating they think he's supporting that's why they're
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.520]  doing the cheers they think he's part of it they don't think he's against them
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.640]  they think he's with them and then all of a sudden they're all the people
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.960]  behind him are starting to chant names at him call them names tell them to go
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.720]  back to Europe we're gonna cut your organs out oh just one horrible thing
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.720]  after and you have such innocence coming up against this out of control crazed
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.320]  leftist evil because the same guy the same native elder had gone to a Catholic
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.680]  church during mass 20 people beat the drum trying to get his ass kicked he goes
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:38.120]  to universities confronts people he it's the same provocateur garbage I wonder
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.760]  what's gonna happen to him because he went on NPR another news channels saying
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:46.120]  he was afraid he was protecting these poor black people from these evil white
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.080]  demons but in reality we know what he was doing he's trying to lead the black
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:55.240]  Israelites into a confrontation to have a racial incident happen so that he
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:59.040]  could phrase that that's his job a doctor's office visit for erectile

[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:24.120]  lines of the info war Robert Barnes is here he of course represented a lot of
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:29.120]  famous people Leslie Snipes you name it he takes on the system big times at
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:34.800]  Barnes under core law Barnes law LLP and he's representing the coming to get some
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.240]  of them others have some other lawyers as well and you say great the more the
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.640]  mayor you're doing it pro bono just to get other lawyers to trigger and get the
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:46.160]  stampede going because as you've said this is lawfare they're using to shut
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:50.240]  down conservatives and others but this info this is clearly premeditated
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.640]  garbage with a group that works for Facebook called now this being the first
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:58.440]  to put both videos out of these so-called native women a few months ago in DC
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.080]  again I was at a public place people knew I was there they come up they call me
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:09.160]  white monkey my mother's married to her brother I had to go back to Europe and I
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:12.600]  said man that's really racist and she go I'm just a veteran why are you are
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.440]  asking me we have the raw footage well this was all edited together and they
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:23.760]  work in concert so the left is all about deception but okay I'm not as
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.960]  sympathetic as these young people and also got back on their face that's why
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.320]  they're in so much trouble with the situation with coverage and because they
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:34.160]  handled it just right that's precisely right did these kids did what we would
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.560]  want our kids to do they didn't react they didn't respond they didn't attack
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.880]  they didn't try to initiate or instigate or further the confrontation instead they
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.920]  just did their own school cheers and then when somebody came in the middle of
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.400]  their group who is an agent provocateur who has a lifelong history of being a
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.960]  provocateur that's what he does he's a lefty protest provocateur people like
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.760]  Clay Travis were right away saying look I know the guys like this since the 1990s
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.920]  when I lived in DC you couldn't go to the Lincoln Memorial without somebody doing
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:04.040]  some crazy protest and it was instigating confrontation and the irony here was the
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:07.440]  things that Nathan Phillips accused the kids of were actually things that the
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.540]  black Hebrew Israelite group behind him was doing he claimed that he was
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:14.000]  defending the black Hebrew Israelite group from chance of build the wall and
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.960]  racial taunts those were coming from the black Hebrew Israelite group not from
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.600]  the kids kids weren't chanting build the wall black Hebrew Hebrew Israelites were
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.760]  talking about build the wall the kids weren't saying a racial taunts it was
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.920]  the black Hebrew Israelites who were doing every racial taunt no demand they
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.400]  did racist taunts against black students who were part of the Covington
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.400]  group they were doing against Native Americans who are in the area they were
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.400]  doing it against white kids there it didn't matter what race or ethnicity you
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:42.600]  were they were chanting some crazy racial slur so he was propagating and
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.680]  helping to instigate and further it and when the black Hebrew Israelites were
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:50.200]  unsuccessful creating a viral video because the kids moved away 50 yards
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.720]  exactly they move back they move internal they look at each other and they
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.240]  start doing chance and so all of a sudden their whole scandal their intended
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:01.200]  viral video is completely falling apart their whole plan on attacking these
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:05.120]  kids and the and what they those kids represent is falling apart and look
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.160]  even the Native Americans can't help but dance with the kids oh you know they're
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:11.200]  trying to start a fight with them the whole tribal of humans coming together
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.760]  they can't help themselves exactly often when they're laughing they're
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.120]  laughing at their own inability did it to dance that's you can tell like he's
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.320]  one who's trying to do something and he's laughing at his own failure to be
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.120]  able to dance as well as the people around him so the media then tries to
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:27.400]  spend this and one thing about you is you you're a real civil rights lawyer that's
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:31.560]  actually gone out and fought some of the you know rare but they do exist white
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.440]  supremacist type groups and represented a lot of people dealing with that but
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:37.720]  you're like the old-fashioned southern lawyer you're from Tennessee folks don't
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:41.360]  know who actually stood up for everybody like an Atticus Finch or something
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:46.040]  so the left now just adopting all the old racial tactics because that they
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.000]  think is gonna work with people and so last night you were breaking down like
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.320]  Black Lives Matter how they always choose a bad case actually create division they
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.640]  know what they're doing absolutely so I represent someone who died in custody in
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.960]  Milwaukee jail in the state of Perry James Perry they treated him like he was
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:06.600]  just a garbage bag and and he died I mean he had epilepsy that he had
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:10.680]  diabetes I was untreated they weren't treating it he told them about this they
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:14.200]  ended up here he is he has things coming from his mouth they spit mask them
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:19.040]  they basically pig you know the tie him up and throw him inside it and guys
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:23.280]  let's humanize him James Perry died Milwaukee we can pull up an image or
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.120]  some news articles sure so this is a nice guy this is a guy as a family it's
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.920]  his family he had a young child all you the he made a mistake he was in jail but
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:33.880]  he hadn't been convicted of anything he had been convicted of any crime he was
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:38.480]  simply in jail awaiting his arraignment he tells them upfront by the way I have
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.880]  these untreated medical conditions they do nothing to treat those medical
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:45.760]  conditions he ends up being treated in fact well one of the police officers
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:48.240]  tells him if you're gonna act like an animal I'm gonna treat you like an
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.800]  animal he was urinating on himself he was defecating on himself and they were
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.720]  giving him no treatment they left him in isolation then they let the they let
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.720]  him die right in front of him on the on the medical room floor and so I bring
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.120]  that suit can't get the groups like Black Lives Matters or other political
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:06.960]  sized groups like that even be involved they won't be engaged they won't support
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.960]  it instead they pick cases that look like a caricature of civil rights they
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:15.040]  look for guys with long wrap wrap sheets guys who had problematic conduct
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.520]  guys often were being confrontational because their political objective and
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.080]  political goal is to trigger racial divide and racial divisiveness it's not
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.480]  to actually help the African-American community it's not to help obtain and
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:29.800]  achieve civil rights for ordinary people it's entirely intended to to support a
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.720]  politicized agenda that isn't about the rights of everyday people including
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.520]  whether they're white with African-american with Latino and I represented
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.480]  those people all across the country for the better part of 20 years fighting
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.400]  various forms of abuse whether that abuse is by an employer or by the
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.360]  government but they're often not there often the political left is not there
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:50.120]  to support them they're not there when it's cut and dry because a black guy
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:55.600]  with diabetes having convulsions being allowed to die by cynical people we're
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.840]  all gonna come together and say that's wrong and repudiate it but if it's a
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.720]  big black guy with a big criminal record charging cops trying to attack him and
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.960]  all the witnesses say he was attacking him well just just say that he didn't
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.520]  attack him because that'll make whites think it's unreasonable and then a lot
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:13.480]  of black folks will still buy into it and now you have real division and now
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.320]  you keep it going forever precisely I mean they've actually made civil rights
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.080]  cases harder for all of the civil rights lawyers in the country to bring
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.480]  because now more and more Republicans and more and more conservatives think
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.160]  that if you're bringing an allegation that the allegations likely false when
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:30.200]  the allegation is likely true but because they have discredited the civil
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.040]  rights movement by politicizing it and bringing the worst cases to public
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.680]  light bringing the least credible cases I mean there's a reason why the NAACP
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.560]  picked Rosa Parks they didn't pick like the the drunk bum who was harassing
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:45.040]  people on the bus they pick Rosa Parks because that United she didn't work all
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.200]  day she was tired absolutely never criminal record and a pure great
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.880]  American it recognized that that Americanism transcends race transcends
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:55.240]  religion transcends politics that's what they don't want because they want
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.560]  divisiveness they want divide they want conflict they want confrontation also if
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.280]  you're the Democratic Party and you fail to deliver for the African-American
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:06.680]  community going on almost 50 years now you haven't delete then you're in a
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.240]  political position where you have to keep getting people to vote for you
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.200]  without actually delivering any substantive material benefit so instead
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.880]  you're just gonna protect them from the bloodthirsty cops that are trying to
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.040]  kill you but then there's only maybe a few hundred people innocent a year they
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.000]  get shot it's still a problem if you're the person happening but becomes this
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.880]  giant diversion from thousands dead a year in Chicago at each other's hands
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.160]  precisely you need a solution you need a problem that you have no solution for
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.400]  because the moment there's a solution then that takes the entire thing all
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:34.560]  apart as once you have a solution there's no need to vote Democrat anymore if
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.720]  you actually achieve economic equality for the African-American community then
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.520]  the net political effect of that is going to be they don't have any reason to
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.200]  vote Democrat anymore they'll vote for whoever is best advocating for their
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.280]  interest so you need them dependent and the only way you keep them dependent is
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.760]  a permanent state of victimhood and the only way you create a permanent state of
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:52.000]  victimhood is you don't solve the problem and by the way people figured this
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.960]  out but it's in the WikiLeaks Hillary with top psychology professors going
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.200]  well we've been using culture war and racial division we suggest we turn the
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.480]  heat up and then they're in the emails going how do we turn it up well you've
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.720]  seen that the last three years they have turned it up precisely it's not a
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:10.920]  coincidence that black lives matter all of a sudden appears on the scene around
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.480]  the same time President Obama is failing to deliver material benefits to the
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:17.680]  African-American community and it's not a coincidence suddenly disappears once
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.240]  the election is gone we've heard very little from them politically for quite
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.880]  a long time so this is entirely politically manipulated not designed
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.600]  they're designed to suck the oxys in out of the room precisely that they're
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.000]  designed to increase divisiveness because as long as people hate each other
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.280]  they can't unite against their real adversary which is the institutional
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.760]  corporate political structure that suppresses their rights and represses
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.800]  their economic opportunity and because in the even the power structure there
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.400]  are reformers but by having this big fight it just diverts it away from reform
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.680]  precisely that's the whole goal that's the whole of them stop reform and Trump
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.560]  I would say has been trying to reform doesn't mean he's not at all done but
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.200]  he's a reformer absolutely we'll be right back stay with us
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:01.120]  hi I'm Dan Pilla I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried

[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.720]  Bill of Rights the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions they're
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:20.320]  prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking

[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:37.560]  it the UN 2030 Agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:41.200]  want people out of the suburbs they want to pack everybody into the cities
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:46.640]  because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone it's the

[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:39.000]  Stuart Rhodes here of Oath Keepers in just a moment and since I mentioned it
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:45.600]  here is Bill Maher blaming the young people a week after was admitted that
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.880]  they didn't start the argument they did nothing wrong still blaming them and
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:55.520]  then making a pedophilic joke here it is but the black Hebrew started to mix it
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:00.880]  up with these Catholic high school kids who were there from Kentucky right okay
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:05.800]  and they were there with a big pro-life march and then a Native American elder
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:12.440]  playing a drum got in the middle to mediate and now it's a big thing and
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:16.160]  you know people saying the kid the kid I don't blame the kid the smirking kid I
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:23.320]  blame lead poisoning and bad parenting and oh yeah I blame that kid what a
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:34.960]  little smirk face like that's not a dick move at any a to stick your face in
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:40.320]  this elderly man and this smirking kid says he was just trying to diffuse the
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:44.720]  situation but really you know what next time you get into a fight with your wife
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:50.600]  or your husband or your boyfriend or your girlfriend try that
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.680]  getting just from their face with a shit eating grid and see if it diffuses the
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:05.520]  situation yes yes me this kid should have done what everyone does during a
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:14.960]  drum solo leave but I mean I don't spend a lot of time I must tell you around
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:22.080]  Catholic school children but I do not get what Catholic priests see in these
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:31.160]  kids we know what you get the name of your production company is kid love and
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.640]  we have clips of you saying the 12 year olds people have sex with 35 year olds
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:42.000]  because it's just love the actual slogan of Nambla but that's a side issue we
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.720]  have Robert Barnes lawyer for some of the young people who first started the
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:49.760]  ball rolling pro bono here in studio with us and we also have Stuart Rhodes at
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.400]  the scene there at Covington High School in Kentucky he's running an operation
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:58.280]  founder of Oath Keepers pops in with us Robert Poppin anytime as well here but
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:03.640]  you've you've got a press release out on this call to action standing up for the
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:08.120]  students of Covington High because here we are two weeks later they're still
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:20.920]  putting out this info attacking them because of the nationwide libel and
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:25.040]  slander against these students that has caused a terrorist and a political left
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:30.680]  to jump on them and for the first time in our nation's recent history threatened
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.600]  children with death which is disturbing and disgusting and so we're here to offer
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:38.640]  our protection to students going to and from school and if they needed after
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.800]  homes well that's great and and I want to get your report more on that there's
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.880]  really high wind there Stuart if you can jump in your truck or your car will
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:50.000]  come right back to at the next segment but I want people to be able to hear
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.680]  exactly what you say Robert Barnes again this case is super important because
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:01.560]  it illustrates the entire spectrum of disinformation and a corporate press
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:05.720]  ready to join together and fraud and it shows who their enemy is independent
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:10.800]  little islands that haven't fallen to Hollywood's control what comes next and
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.880]  what do you make a bill more I mean I think I mean the bill Mars biggest
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:19.800]  mistake was even though he's a comedian he's on live TV so verbal slander is
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.440]  treated differently than written slander in Kentucky so he's on a little bit
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:27.080]  safer legal grounds and because he's a comedian he said create and he has a
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.440]  history of saying crazy things in general he has a certain flexibility with
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.720]  what he says his mistake here was being so specific about a fact when he said
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:40.760]  this kid got into the native elders face so mr. Sammons represented by a very
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:44.320]  good lawyer out of Atlanta Lynn Wood who said he's now evaluating the bill more
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:47.440]  statements and I'm sure it will and looking at it from a third-party
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.120]  perspective that's a lie by Bill Maher and it's a very simple lie because of
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:55.760]  the kid didn't get into anybody's face and it's a lie once the ultimatum is
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.440]  already out there that we're watching you absolutely so the he knew it was a
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.400]  lie he just repeats the lie how would Bill Maher like it if somebody kept going
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.840]  up into his face and following him around everywhere and putting a drum in
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.360]  his face and and bait and beating the drum in his face Bill Maher I've seen
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:13.680]  what he he always reacted in other situations he's run at them he's run
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.840]  after them he's he's attacked them that's been his reaction so for him to sit
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:21.400]  there and attack some kid he still doesn't know based on a video he didn't
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:24.880]  obviously read or if he did he's just lying about he either didn't watch it
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.040]  didn't review it didn't read what happened or he's simply lying about it
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:31.480]  either way he's making a false statement about a kid that's that that's
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.360]  verifiably false that has subjected him to potential litigation and they've
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.200]  already had to shut down the school they've gotten bomb threats they've
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:41.440]  gotten death threats who are some of the other prom candidates for suits here I
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:45.880]  know you won't give away your your attack before it happens but we've got
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:48.640]  Kathy Griffin we've got others I think Kathy Griffin is a guarantee to get
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:52.280]  sued because she of I mean she went out there and said please docks these kids
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.960]  please docks them I mean that don't frankly I don't think that's ever
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:58.200]  happened before of a celebrity and she said don't think they wouldn't do it to
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:02.360]  you exactly these kids that have no clue who Kathy Griffin is so the idea that
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.760]  they would ever docks her is insane but the the fact that she would go out there
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.160]  and call for it refuse to retract it refuse to correct it she did retract
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.040]  one offending tweet when I asked her to do so but she didn't retract that tweet
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.880]  so she's on pace to get sued unless she settles it within the next week the same
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.240]  is true for Maggie Haberman from the lead reporter for the New York Times who
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:23.440]  lied about these kids misled the world about these kids called for these kids
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:27.580]  to be expelled based on a video she had failed to properly vet and read and
[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:30.920]  review and even when she knew it was false even when her own newspaper printed
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:34.320]  that her original version of the story was false she has refused to correct her
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.760]  personal statement so she's gonna be subject to suit as the one as the lead
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.480]  reporter the lead White House reporter for the New York Times in addition there's
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:45.200]  gonna be others Matthew Dowd who's a big commentator for ABC News one of those
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:49.240]  sort of fake Republicans originally from Austin Wayback's family from Michigan
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:54.320]  got his name to fame by working for the W campaign and then attacking W got him
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:58.240]  on to ABC and now he's sort of their their their local fake Republican just
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:01.320]  like in a Navarro who also lied about these kids and has refused to fully
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:05.400]  retract and correct she's subject to potential suit so there's a range of
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.680]  people that we put notice on there's about a dozen other people that we've
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:12.480]  given notices to and some of them have corrected many of them have not and
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.960]  those that have not are subject to suit and those suits will be filed over the
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.720]  next month if they don't settle do you think this is gonna make now this and
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.560]  other groups that help stage these things a little more paranoid knowing that
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.440]  hey conservatives and others are ready to sue you that's the goal the objective
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.440]  is they are so accustomed to facing no consequence no impact no no effect
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.840]  whatsoever to their reckless rogue lawless acts that they have grown too
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:39.400]  arrogant and they need to be brought back down to life right back down to
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:42.720]  reality of the situation that's right let's go back to Stuart Rhodes he's there
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:46.880]  at the high school with his big national group of keepers of veteran
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.120]  patriot needs no introduction here again because your audio was breaking up
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.560]  earlier recap why you're there the operation you guys have launched well
[01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:59.080]  yes we're here to stand for the students and to stand against terrorism
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.600]  basically they were right to free speech and assembly and association and they
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.480]  should not be threatened with death this is disturbing that we haven't talked
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:09.600]  about this in this country that they have school children being threatened with
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:13.560]  being murdered because they dare to be pro-life or wear a MAGA hat on their head
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:18.120]  and it's directly because of the slander and libel of the mass media in this
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:22.240]  country this is happening so mr. Barnes is correct need to be called called out
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.320]  and held the account for it and frankly this would prosecutions as well for
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:29.640]  terrorism this is what this is the use of force to threaten use of force for
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:33.200]  political ends which is exactly what antifa has been doing for two years now
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.560]  but now it's being applied to children and frankly it's at once no surprise
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.320]  because of the pattern of the left but also disturbing this is where we're at
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.160]  now in this country I'll say that we're gonna come back next segment with both
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:47.440]  you because I should also say you're not just a veteran everything else a great
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:51.040]  patriot you're also a constitutional lawyer award-winning as well from some
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:54.680]  of the same universities as this guy so we get two constitutional lawyers take
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:58.080]  on this perspective about how crazy because conservatives and nationalists
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.280]  and patriots were not drama queens but when you pull back these are high school
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:05.280]  and middle school students were also there being debt-threaded the media is
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.960]  ganging up on it saying they still deserve it a week and a half later that
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:13.720]  is sensational that is sensational I know no doubt about it I mean it's
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.840]  scandalous I mean what they did to these kids what they're willing to do to your
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:20.120]  kids to anybody else's kids that's the frightening thing and that's the real
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:23.720]  message here the message is we can destroy your kids future everything

[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:05.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:24.280]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.680]  they've got constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes here and we've got
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:32.360]  constitutional lawyer but this is well Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers he's on
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:38.200]  the ground at the Covington Catholic School there in Kentucky and I was
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:41.600]  asking this question of Robert earlier I want to ask you this and then your
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.520]  article at oathkeepers.org goes through these new thought crimes of just
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:52.280]  standing your ground smiling confidently is a new hate symbol your
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:56.440]  constitutional lawyer your father your veteran you've been around the block you
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:48:02.040]  worked for Ron Paul so you've seen a few things what is the vitriolic foaming at
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:08.400]  the mouth hatred coming out of the left and the branding of anybody white as
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:13.480]  bad I mean it's just so crazy out of the left what do you think their in-game is
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:17.600]  and why do you think they're doing it Stuart? Well they're making Orwell's
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.560]  mentioning before an actual reality rather than a warning of what not to do
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:27.760]  they're using it as a manual ironically it's face crime it's thought crime and
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:30.720]  now you can call it hat crime whether it's not a hate crime but a hat crime
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:36.620]  wearing the wrong hat and they want to criminalize all of these things they
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:42.000]  consider to be you know unacceptable and and outside of their worldview they
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.800]  want to demonize it and criminalize it if they could do it through the state
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.000]  they will do that but if they can't do it through the state they'll do it through
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.920]  private violence through anti-fog of the terrorist organizations like that but
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:58.280]  their end goal is to really actualize Orwell's 1984 and make anybody who is
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:03.560]  not them the enemy I mean Trump is Goldstein and all of us who are Trump
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:07.000]  supporters or anybody wears a MAGA hat even if they just bought it that day is
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.880]  considered to be Goldstein's followers who must be demonized and hated and
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.600]  smashed and crushed and burned alive that's right the 10 minutes of hate in
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:20.920]  fact can we pull it up I forgot to tell you guys in Arizona in a restaurant
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:24.720]  about your blue collar workers they have a picture of coal miners coming out of
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:29.080]  the mine and drinking beer which you have blackface once you do it that's what
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:32.640]  coal miners look like they also get black lung they go oh we want this down
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:39.080]  this is racist so everything is projected onto this and it just gets
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.960]  crazier meanwhile all of us are losing our privacy rights we're losing the
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:47.120]  right of our sovereignty we're losing all of these things that's up on
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:51.720]  news wars.com what do you think the control corporate left is trying to do
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:55.480]  here Robert Barnes I think it's well my 20 year old 21 year old son put it
[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:58.280]  well he and he's not even very political he's not like you know
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:01.760]  conservative or libertarian or an activist it always is the gamer and he
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.760]  said I think the world is telling me after you saw the Covington story I'm
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.520]  supposed to feel bad just because of the color of my skin and the gender I was
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:12.320]  born with and that's been the message the message is feel bad for who you are
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.880]  feel it's like a bad version of a Tom Wolf novel it's like Tom Wolf on LSD and
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:21.560]  it's the insanity of it and the message is you cannot be yourself you can't
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.400]  trust yourself it's to destroy and direct and obliterate the past to kill
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:29.840]  male confidence absolutely to because this has been a the one of the last
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:33.760]  places disproportionately white men politically are advocating for
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.880]  traditional causes and traditional ideas in various forms of the political
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:41.080]  atmosphere so they see that as a threat so how do you demonize that threat when
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.840]  when you can't debate the ideas when you can't debate Jordan Peterson you can't
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:48.440]  debate Stefan Malinu you can't debate Mike Cernovich what do you do you demonize
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:51.320]  them simply because of the color of their skin and their gender and it's so
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:55.080]  ironic because it's exactly against what King taught King's home in one of the
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:59.040]  greatest Americans in American history political history social history is
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:02.040]  Martin Luther King and what he taught was not because he tapped into American
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:06.120]  absolutely he said let's judge who our whole dream our whole ideal our whole
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:10.080]  democratic structure is built on the presumption that we will recognize
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:13.000]  people for the content of their character not the color of their skin as a
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.080]  little kid I had all his little eight you know those little cassette tapes I had
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:18.760]  all of his speeches all of his sermons I used to listen to him all the time
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:21.920]  saved up a little money I had just so I could listen to them as a kid as a 12
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:26.760]  13 14 year old and we are deep what the left is doing is demonizing his legacy
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:29.440]  destroying his leg well you heard universities are actually taking his
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:33.680]  bus down because he didn't mention LGBT that wasn't even an issue that is which
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:38.400]  is insane it's when Martin Luther King when you have to remove him from your
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:42.600]  icon from your icons then you clearly have lost your your sense of direction
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:48.240]  King was kind of the the end of the whole Christian Renaissance movement the
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:52.800]  Enlightenment what what what the what the abolitionists had done to try to
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:57.600]  speak to America's soul to do the right thing and the left betrayed that whole
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:00.840]  deal is now juxtaposing trying to turn the minorities into the very same
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:05.760]  paradigm we fought to reverse Stuart Rhodes absolutely they are the ones
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:10.480]  who are racist and racially focused with identity politics and as Mr. Barnes said
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.640]  they're they're now attempting to demonize everyone with white skin as a
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:18.560]  political weapon against their political opponents and of course you know
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:22.320]  Thomas Sallard and other conservative black people don't get up get a pass
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:26.160]  either they're considered Oreos and they're demonized as well but it's all
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:30.800]  about identity politics as a weapon against the West and a weapon against
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:37.960]  our Constitutional Republic what do you think coming next to it rods more
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:42.320]  violence I expect the weather underground style attacks the two to be
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:45.920]  commencing sin I think the left is eventually gonna go fully kinetic and
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:50.680]  kill somebody that's why we're here I think the school is being secured now by
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:54.720]  Homeland Security and the local police pretty effectively but we want to offer
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:57.680]  we feel duty bound to offer our protection to the students going to and
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:01.720]  from school and also through homes if they need it and Mr. Barnes then goes
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.920]  for you if I know you're under a bomb threat we have members in California
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:09.680]  retired cops there you're one step up to protect you if you need it and by the
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:13.200]  way we had to pay for protection here now it's longer being again drama Queens
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:16.080]  look at Tucker Carlson had to basically move out of his house only in the
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:19.480]  specifics but there was not just the threats you saw on TV they've had to
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:23.600]  leave and that's inside baseball that's where we've gotten to this country
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:27.160]  absolutely and especially once the media starts to green light this kind of
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:30.680]  violence that's why it's very problematic when people like Reza Aslan go
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:33.960]  out there and talk about punching him in the face very problematic when Kathy
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:37.720]  Griffin says let's docks these kids very problematic when he said I'll give you
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:43.320]  sex it's a classic thing like a woman you can have me if you go after that son
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:47.280]  of a bitch I mean that's like offering money on the table attractive woman says
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.840]  I'll have sex with you go out there and attack people well I mean that was a young
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:54.600]  self-described Saturday night live writer who was saying those kind of
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:58.320]  comments so that's terrifying by the way what would happen if somebody walked up
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:01.920]  knocked her teeth out I'm not saying do that oh it be a woman's attack it's
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:05.720]  horrible the media would ignore she called for it so under common law under
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:09.400]  common sense she's fair game I'm not saying do it but what would happen if
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:12.040]  somebody knocked her in the teeth when I think what they want is violent
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:15.960]  conflict they want the excuse and the premise and the pretense to be able to
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:18.960]  demonize these groups to be able to strip them of their liberty strip them of
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:21.760]  their rights strip them of the the audience's right to listen to whom they
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:25.400]  want where they want how they want because their goal is mind control thought
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:29.040]  control idea control you have to think like them it's very much like the
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:33.200]  inquisition era of the 15th century they see any heretics is dangerous they
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:36.240]  need to be burned at the stake they need to be censored shamed and banished they
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:39.240]  need to be isolated they're building their own wall and you can only think
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:42.280]  what those inside the wall say you can think and if you don't then you'll be
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:45.240]  banished or destroyed and it's part of a pattern that it's deeper and more
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:48.400]  pernicious and it just reached out when everybody was shocked by it because they
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.800]  said if they could do this to a bunch of kids Catholic school kids who are
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:54.800]  trying to do the best they can under difficult circumstances then they can
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.320]  do it to anybody anywhere anytime well that's right maybe we can pull up that
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.320]  famous Roman statesman quote Cicero about the the enemy within being the plague
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:06.920]  because Stuart your historian on his constitutional lawyer smart guy in
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:11.600]  closing how do we stop this because clearly America can only fall from
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:18.840]  within but our milk and honey has caused a lot of decadence and so we're we're
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:24.400]  getting soft or myself included but we're strong against the country itself
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:29.720]  how do we deal with a criminal cult that really means to take the country over
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:33.920]  stand up stand your ground do exactly what the students did but Nick did
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.920]  staying there that day and then afterwards he refused to apologize it was
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:42.440]  an attempt to pressure him to to give in and apologize for something he did not
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:48.880]  do so stand your ground don't give them any any benefit of credence for their
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.120]  position because their positions are bankrupt be Americans stand up and
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:57.720]  defend your right to free speech and assembly for all Americans and be
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:01.920]  consistent about that and and don't buy into the threat you know don't counter
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:05.760]  them with with also threatening them let them be the ones to show the true
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:09.400]  colors which they are doing right now that's all the more better so you know
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:13.640]  light sunlight bring attention to it and stand your ground and don't apologize
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:16.840]  for being Americans being free all right Stuart Rhodes how you're up there
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:19.280]  let's talk to you tomorrow if you have time God bless we really appreciate you
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:23.400]  both keepers of ORG to see more of what you're doing thank you I want to just be
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:26.840]  very clear about this we come back briefly I'll talk about solutions here
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:31.920]  but most times we go out to cover an event there are no independent media
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.740]  there that means just a person with a camera and a YouTube account if you go
[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:40.360]  to any leftist demonstration you will see the most mentally ill insane people
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.760]  setting people up doing incredibly insane things and they may have a YouTube
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:49.200]  channel with 50 followers it'll have 50,000 after you're done because that
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:54.160]  video will go viral but most the time there's no one there to catch it when
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:57.040]  these people try to set folks up if there weren't other cameras they're
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:00.840]  catching the setup it wouldn't have happened when we come back I'll show
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.920]  Owen shroyer yesterday having a psychotic actually attack him and eat his
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:10.480]  microphone and then smell it and then roll around the ground like a demon so
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:14.560]  that footage is actually coming up but this is mass mental illness briefly
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:19.500]  because I get so busy I don't plug I'm our worst nightmare around here folks we

[01:58:57.160 --> 01:59:01.160]  operatives the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:04.560]  syndicate people say why would you start a fight with them because they were
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:08.520]  already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no

[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:29.040]  Robert Barnes is a smart cook and I say that about a lot of folks but I had
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:31.440]  dinner with him for two hours I was familiar with his work over the years
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:37.680]  changed from the big cases he's handled most of them successfully but talking to
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:42.080]  him and he really has a big general knowledge of things because most people
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:45.280]  have a specialized knowledge and I think my knowledge is it you know isn't
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:48.240]  perfect for that great sometimes but compared to other people it's a general
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:52.240]  knowledge and talking to you last night for two hours just your general knowledge
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:55.600]  was right in line with mine and then some very very exciting there's so much
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:59.120]  to cover this hour but what do you want to get into well I think with part of
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:02.400]  these sort of the broader pattern the broader aspect of what's taking place
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:07.360]  here is that the media is starting to greenlit violence in crazy minds because
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:11.520]  the when you have New York Times writers former CNN producers major Hollywood
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.920]  celebrities saying that the effect of this is it's okay to be violent let's
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:20.040]  punch him in the face it's such a punchable face let's dock some let's go
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:23.960]  after them I'll provide sexual services if you go out and attack this person
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:26.680]  they're telling their green-lidding they know what they're doing their green
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:31.200]  leading the the the most craziest danger they're dehumanizing absolutely that's
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:34.600]  the goal it's very much like they're trying to recreate the 1930s where in
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.560]  1930s Europe you had clashes on the streets between the communists and the
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:40.120]  fascists they're trying to create a violent movement they're trying to
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:43.040]  instigate that violent movement they're trying to inspire that violent movement
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:47.640]  and when you'll do it against kids 12-year-old 13-year-old kids who have
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:51.360]  never been in the public light in their lives whose only crime was showing up at
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:55.760]  Lincoln Memorial in a hat that simply said make America great again that's it
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:00.040]  and you say oh you know what that's that's like the clan outfit that's like
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:03.200]  the clan hood you know what they're saying is go out there and punch them go
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.280]  out there and attack them go out there and do something violent go and do what
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:10.120]  that man did and to the Republicans at the softball field they're green lighting
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:13.480]  it they're approving it and the fact that they'll stand by it even when it's
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:16.760]  exposed as a fraud they'll stand by it even when they know the threats of
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:20.080]  violence that are coming in shows you just how dangerous this environment is
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:24.520]  oh yeah put our Islamic member of Congress's tweet back up there that's
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:30.400]  Omar at Ilhan Omar the boys were protesting a woman's right to choose
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:34.480]  and yell it's not right if you enjoy it that is such defamation never said that
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:39.880]  they were taunting five black before they surrounded Phillips and led racist
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.560]  camps this is a total inversion of reality Sandman's family hired a right
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:49.880]  wing PR firm to write his non-apology none of that's true exactly all of it
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:53.680]  were lies and I'll give the congresswoman credit within one hour of me telling her
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:57.600]  that she needed to retract that would be sued she did so the but it's one of the
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:01.200]  only offending things that she's ever retracted one of the only horrible
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:04.240]  statements that she's ever pulled back but all of those were lies and they knew
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:07.160]  they were lies and the fact that you have other you have senator Warren she's
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:10.280]  likely to be sued next week unless she takes down her offending Elizabeth Warren
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:14.560]  Elizabeth Warren so you have a you know a fake Indian spreading fake news and the
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:17.680]  the nature of that here you have a senator who's one of the leading
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:21.600]  Democratic candidates for the presidency of the United States and yet
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:24.920]  she's out there defaming kids she's never met based on a video either she
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:28.920]  didn't review or she lied about reviewing and and even when she knew it was
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:32.260]  false even when she knew the story was false she continued to propagate it
[02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:36.280]  continued to perpetuate it congresswoman howlin did the same thing out of New
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:40.960]  Mexico by the way let's be straight on this you never plan to sue the diocese
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:44.920]  or others they got on the bandwagon that was another hoax put up by the media
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:48.040]  drive a wedge between you and the families precisely there was a story
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:51.520]  spread that I was gonna sue the local priest I was gonna sue the local the
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:54.640]  local school system I was gonna sue the diocese I was never gonna do any of
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:57.160]  those things and the parents weren't interested in that the parents were
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:59.800]  interested in preserving and protecting their reputation there was I just
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:03.640]  wanted apologies so the death threats would stop oh precisely exactly that
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:06.920]  was it they just want people to go back to normal what to go back to where it
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:10.280]  was a week before they knew they never could completely restore that but they
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:13.120]  just wanted to protect their children protect their children's lives protect
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:16.200]  their children's future that's it they wanted nothing more than that nothing
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:19.000]  beyond that they weren't here to make a political statement what's happened is
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  the left's infiltrated the main Vatican with all their pedophiles to bring it
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.720]  down there's still all these little independent Catholic groups that are
[02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:28.640]  wholesome and good and the left is pissed they can't get control that
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:31.760]  absolutely that's exactly right it's very much that these are people who have
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:35.000]  their own independent narrative their own independent story their own independent
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.360]  understanding of the world and they hate and they're strong and they're moral
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:41.720]  and they're controlled and that is everything the establishment doesn't
[02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:45.880]  like they're independent they're not weak exactly and that's exactly what they
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:49.080]  are most threatened by that's why they're threatening it they're afraid of
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:59.480]  just decency we'll be back on Alex Jones news wars com when it comes to

[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:25.040]  frontline report if you are receiving this transmission you are the
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:37.520]  resistance coming to you live from the info wars dot com studios in the
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:46.040]  recaptured state of Texas it's Alex Jones we are back live broadcasting
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:51.680]  worldwide turning for many of the Catholic school kids the Covington in
[02:06:51.680 --> 02:06:56.920]  Kentucky is riding shotgun with us and we are looking with Robert Barnes at the
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:01.360]  whole waterfront here and what's unfolding I want to get to just one
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:07.080]  piece of footage that's gone viral on info wars dot com since last night the
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:11.960]  millions of views on every platform out there with Owen shroyer is in DC
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:16.000]  covering Roger Stone indictment and you know in arraignment and hearings coming
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.520]  up so he sees a protester group the big giant rat on the back of a truck you'll
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:27.560]  see the video in a moment and so all that unfolded then was that we'll see the
[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:31.040]  video he walks across the street he's showing the rat and the guy runs over
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:36.120]  grabs his microphone trying to eat the microphone cover tries to put spit in
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:42.320]  his eyes tries to spit on his camera and it's just look the liberals I thought
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:46.920]  of 20 30 years ago were like lawyers that went out and whether you were poor
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:49.920]  white person or a poor black person whatever represented you if you got
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:53.640]  screwed over for you know for pro bono like Robert Barnes is famous for doing
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:59.120]  but you look at weird academic leftist man they're all like escaped mental
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:05.680]  institutions wards if you got these events you we're not just cherry picking
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:09.920]  these people there seems like there's something fundamentally wrong with them
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:14.120]  and it's a malaise that's spreading now Robert obviously you won't agree with me
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:17.320]  if that's not your perception what is your perception of what I just said and
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:21.280]  what do you think this is it's sort of a you know Jonathan hate a very good
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.640]  professor has described it as part of call-out culture so what's happened is
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:28.240]  they've combined social media call-out culture in a degree to which a lot of
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:32.880]  children weren't allowed to play in the early 90s as the abduction stories
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:36.360]  became big stories so their parents told their kids not to go outside and play
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:38.960]  and so they created this sort of safe space environment from the time they're
[02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:42.160]  young and that's been reinforced by culture reinforced now by university
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:46.000]  life and what you have is you have these provocateurs and lefty protest culture
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.520]  who believe that the more insane they are the more social prestige they're
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:53.680]  going to acquire the so it becomes within their world be nuttier be crazier be
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:57.160]  wackier to create more provocation create more of a viral news story no
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:09:00.080]  matter how fake it is no matter how ludicrous it is and that's what gets you
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:03.360]  brownie points in your little social milieu and the effect of it is very
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:06.360]  dangerous to ordinary innocent everyday people who are just trying to exercise
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.200]  their civil rights and civil liberties and it's become very precarious for
[02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:13.040]  people across the political spectrum but particularly for people from the
[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:17.520]  political right because they're the most often targeted by these lefty violent
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:22.000]  protesters who often acted in sane ways solely to provoke a reaction in a
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.840]  response and here they just did it to ordinary everyday kids but they do it
[02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:27.840]  to ordinary people all the time they're not targeting people in power they're
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:31.440]  targeting ordinary people they're bullish exactly they're pure bullies that's
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:34.800]  what I explained early on about the what I learned about the Trump campaign when
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:38.200]  I was originally just monitoring for betting purposes and gambling purposes
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:41.800]  I got in and started you know going to rallies and events and I realized that
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:44.840]  Trump wasn't the bully he was the guy who's gonna go up to the bully and punch
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:47.960]  the bully in the mouth and that that's really what was happening because the
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:52.680]  left has become a bullying culture and it's it's intolerant across the board it
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.640]  uses Twitter mobs to attack people it uses literal mobs is what happened in
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:59.080]  Covington to attack people and they always accuse us of being the bullies
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:04.440]  when they have organized scientific safe spaces for bullies to attack people
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:07.920]  absolutely that's exactly what's going on big and the message has been to green
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:11.720]  light whatever activity they do to green light the worst behavior the most
[02:10:11.720 --> 02:10:15.000]  demonstrative behavior the potentially most violent behavior I mean think if
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.240]  those kids had been any other kind of kids I mean I knew folks I grew up with
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:20.920]  in southeast Tennessee they would have reacted very differently to that kind of
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:23.360]  name-calling and that kind of attacking they would have been a lot less
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:26.480]  generous a lot less civil a lot less of Christian character in their
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:30.840]  reaction these kids reacted the best you could possibly imagine or those set of
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:34.080]  certain that's what made the establishment even more pests and spin it
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:38.200]  even worse because it was that Jedi control they couldn't stand precisely the
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:41.160]  more innocent they were the more they had to libel them more innocent there
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:43.800]  were the more they had to lie about them the more innocent there were the more
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:46.680]  they had to destroy the reputation and that also serves ultimately their
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:50.320]  political agenda and their political objectives because if they're able to so
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:54.280]  defame them and so destroy them when they are so innocent then what can they do
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:57.320]  to an ordinary person anywhere in the walk of life who dares to voice a
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:06.320]  dissident view to me the left has no bottom now and so the very worst of them
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:09.960]  becomes their new leader and then somebody else will go even further and so I
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:14.520]  think it's a radicalization curve absolutely it's basically Gawker culture
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:18.680]  writ large so you look at Gawker and what got Gawker was you had reporters for
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:22.160]  Gawker in depositions say that it would have been okay to show a sex tape
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:25.960]  involving a five-year-old that that they said their limit was maybe four years
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:29.880]  old that's who they were that's what they had no bottom no limit and they had
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:32.480]  reached the bottom and they were beyond the gutter the gutter was you know a
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:36.080]  ceiling to them and you're seeing the same thing happen in lefty protest culture
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:39.400]  you're seeing the same thing happen in these in the in the call-out culture of
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:44.160]  Twitter and social media that's targeting to harass to harangue innocent
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:46.920]  ordinary everyday people and the more innocent their behavior the more they're
[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:49.840]  targeted the more they're lied about the more they're tarnished it's old
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:53.160]  tar and feather techniques it's old banishment techniques it's old
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:56.160]  censorship through shaming it's like you said we're adopting the Chinese model
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:59.760]  absolutely in fact that's what's really happening the big tech is combining has
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:02.200]  already been doing it for five to ten years working with the Chinese
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:05.440]  government Google and Facebook and YouTube and the others in order to be
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:09.400]  able to create a social aid where you have big corporate power and big state
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:13.520]  power united with big tech to control the mindset and the thoughts and what
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:17.360]  audience is allowed to hear out in the in the world and they're going to take
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:19.680]  that Chinese model that they've already been employing that they've already
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:24.640]  been using to discriminate the censorship to shame to control and they're
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:27.320]  rolling it out now absolutely doing it right here in the United States and they
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:29.960]  need a premise for it they need a pretext for it the pretext was never
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:33.880]  going to be hey by the way we want to do thought control their pretext was
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:36.480]  going to be there's some dangerous thoughts out there that you need to not
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:39.960]  hear there's some dangerous people out there that you need to not be exposed to
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:43.160]  some day you said it's not even about censoring us it's about controlling what
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:45.440]  other people can see exactly they're telling people hey we're gonna tell you
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:48.960]  we can read or listen to correct they want to control the audience that the I
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:52.160]  mean I will be always be able to speak the question is who gets to hear me and
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:56.000]  I will always be the question is who do I get to hear do I get to hear Alex
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.280]  Jones do I get to hear other people or am I shut off and only allowed to hear
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:04.400]  NBC and ABC and CBS and and Rachel Maddow with her latest crazy collusion theory
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:08.000]  or conspiracy theory so the conspiracy theories are always okay if it's the
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.760]  establishment spreading it about ordinary people it's just not okay if
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:13.480]  ordinary people talk about it in relationship to the political and
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:16.720]  media and corporate establishment and so that's what's happening it's mind
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:19.800]  control is thought control and social control they think like the Catholic
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:22.920]  Church of the 15th century and they're what they're really offended by is they
[02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:26.480]  want to not that what the Catholic schools students are being taught they're
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:29.880]  offended that they don't get to be the Catholic Church their own version of an
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:33.600]  of an ideology that is controlling and and possessive in the way that the
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:37.080]  15th century inquisition was that's what they want that's why they use an
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:40.440]  inquisitional tactics inquisitional techniques they're doing things that have
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:43.360]  been done historically over and over again they're just doing it in a new
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:49.600]  context and disguising and hiding what it actually is what scary is even 10
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:54.080]  years ago the average leftist priest class controller high up knew it was
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:57.600]  going on but most the mid-level low-level and nothing they've actually gotten such
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:03.880]  a cultural bankruptcy now that even their mid-level and low-level folks a lot
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:08.520]  of them get that it's a takeover they get it cynical they get it's a fraud and
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:13.240]  they see our Western open values as a weakness and they're just expanding the
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:17.960]  confines of the cult precisely they see it as an opportunity they see it as a
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:21.560]  hole in the gate and because they believe in sort of a barrier society of
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:24.960]  their own accord barriers being what you're allowed to see what you're allowed
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:28.120]  to think what you're allowed to express what you're allowed to say what you're
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:32.160]  allowed to believe who you're allowed to vote for they think in those terms and
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:34.960]  so they look at all the means and mechanisms to have influence over
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:38.680]  people's minds and I mean I started in civil rights cases rep doing ballot
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:42.000]  access because that was just about your opportunity to vote for who you want but
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.640]  increasingly it's moved now to the tech space in the media space it's about what
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:49.080]  audience the audience can hear can they hear your voice on any particular
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:52.680]  technological medium that's available to them or is that foreclosed is that shut
[02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:56.560]  down is that shut out it's all about making sure you only hear the correct
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:03.600]  ideas from the and it's such classical thoroughbred authoritarian super
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:10.480]  oppressive pure evil I mean it's it's it's it's the bonafide end of civilization
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:14.080]  and it's just rampaging forward absolutely and it's the way they think
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:17.200]  they really if you want to understand their mindset I want to understand their
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:21.720]  approach their mentality simply go and look at how authoritarian regimes have
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.720]  acted in the past particularly the Inquisition era in the 12th 13th 14th
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:28.840]  15th century because they think the same way they behave the same way and
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:32.000]  they're going to continue to until the resistance succeeds at undermining what
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.200]  they're trying to do well I mean if conservatives or nationalists or
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:39.600]  pre-speech folks don't stop bowing down to every political correct statement
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:44.280]  they only make us acquiescing to them the green light to demand more and more
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:48.280]  and more and more to the point of now Google says they're going to ban the
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:53.280]  word family that's right we'll be right back stay with us

[02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:03.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:15.200]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:34.400]  I'm Alex Jones your host Robert Barnes constitutional lawyer a very famous
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:38.640]  successful lawyer who as they say is one of the biggest political gamblers in
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:44.960]  the world and very very successful takes on all those big underdog positions
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:48.280]  I want to get into some of the other big news items and get into other areas of
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:50.760]  history where you think the world's going but I want listeners understand
[02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:58.280]  something. Mainstream media corporate-owned corporate control has its
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:02.560]  basic agenda to keep people on a reservation but if you pull back to the
[02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:08.480]  actual social control going on it's all in the white papers it's all in the
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:14.560]  engineering and the fact that we have this post-prohuman view by the elite
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:19.160]  that if they just become totally ruthless they can consolidate power and
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:27.400]  that they'll have the future is just incredibly twisted and I think evil
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:30.800]  more than anything is not having any rules and by rules I don't mean the
[02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:34.920]  evil controlled rules that the technocracies bring in or authoritarian
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:38.280]  regimes but not having the basic rules that are genetically encoded in us
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:42.280]  these people violate these rules because it gives them limited power and then
[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:46.040]  as things break down they create a cosmology that well that's just part of
[02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:49.760]  their overall organizational system to consolidate control but the truth is
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:54.360]  these are very very lazy twisted fallen unhappy people and then even in a
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:58.360]  subconscious level that they then project their hatred of themselves onto
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:02.320]  us or how would you quantify the sickness in the world versus what's good in the
[02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:05.880]  world and where we are historically. I mean I think we're I mean to a certain
[02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:09.360]  degree the problem that the sort of cultural left has is that ordinary
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:12.760]  Americans don't accept or adopt any of their viewpoints that's why they have
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:16.880]  to do these censorship campaigns these terror campaigns like what they're
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:20.480]  doing to the Covington kids in order to sort of shape up Middle America and get
[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:24.480]  them to to coerce them back into their mindset because the ordinary person
[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:27.200]  doesn't believe it the guy working at the factory the guy working at the local
[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:31.160]  shop the guy working doing his own thing the guy the local mechanic he doesn't
[02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:34.400]  buy into any of this sort of cultural conformist nonsense this sort of
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:37.640]  idolatry of ideology that the left is shaping and putting out there and
[02:22:37.640 --> 02:22:41.160]  perpetrating and propagating and so the advantage is the ordinary person for the
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:45.640]  most part the reason why Trump won thanks a lot more along the lines of Trump
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:49.160]  than they do along the lines of the coercive cultural conformist left and
[02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:53.360]  that's the great utility and advantage that the ordinary person has but in
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:57.440]  that but the what they don't have is a very little access to media power very
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:01.160]  little access to cultural power very little access to entertainment very
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:05.440]  little access to the the entire news infrastructure and that's why they're
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:10.280]  waging such war on info wars and on you is they want all dissident voices to be
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:14.120]  shut down all dissident voices to be silenced so that the audience can't hear
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:17.040]  them the audience can't share them imagine what could have happened to the
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:20.880]  Covington kids if they didn't have anybody like you showing the real story
[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:25.120]  that they may have been known 50 years from now as just being the kids who did
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:28.520]  some horrible racial taunting of a Native American and Lincoln Memorial when
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:32.720]  they're entirely innocent exactly the establishment doesn't see it as our lies
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:36.880]  are failing they're saying they're still voices that can call us on our lies so
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:40.720]  the problem is we haven't eradicated those voices precisely and that's how
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:43.680]  they think they think we need to suppress the voices that the audience is
[02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:46.560]  hearing but it's the same thing that they did with sort of ballot access
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:50.840]  control at the beginning of the century involving Ralph Nader their goal wasn't
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:55.080]  Ralph Nader's particular voice their goal was to suppress the ability of third
[02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:58.320]  voices to have meaningful access to the ballot and that was only about the
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:01.680]  voters rights to choose whom they wanted to express themselves accordingly
[02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:04.720]  they're doing the same thing now in the speech space they're doing the same thing
[02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:07.360]  now in the educational space they're doing the same thing now in the
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:10.360]  entertainment space they're doing the same thing now in the new space they
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:13.200]  want to control all of the means and mechanisms by which our ID and they've
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:17.280]  gotten the traditional left that at least claim that it definitively speech to
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:21.520]  now be the most ardent destroyers of speech and they wonder why as soon as
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:24.560]  they shut down their competition suddenly they're being laid off oh
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:27.760]  precisely well it's interesting the people at Buzzfeed and in Huffington
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:30.120]  Post they were laid off disproportionately were people that had
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:34.080]  libeled the Covington kids so we'll see whether or not one way in which you
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:37.360]  could avoid suit was to fire those people they in fact Huffington Post got
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:41.040]  rid of its entire editorial department and most likely the reason for it was
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:44.840]  their fear of the suit that was coming for the Covington kids so the the
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:48.720]  advantage of people exerting their legal rights their legal remedies to the
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:51.800]  jury system and of the court system in this country in Middle America is they
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:55.160]  can take even the most powerful institutions the most powerful people
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:59.240]  down to ordinary people's level and they face 12 ordinary jurors about whether
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:02.920]  they did right or wrong and when that happens ordinary people and the good
[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:06.520]  values generally went out more often than they don't when we come back let's
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:09.200]  talk about the paradox some will say well Jones you're being brought before
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:13.760]  juries for you to Sandy Hook except I didn't say what they said I said it's
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:19.400]  out of context they keep misquoting me in my own voice to then cause harm and
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:23.320]  pain and then they admit it's done for a political aim to set the press this
[02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:26.320]  we'll talk about that after the break because you've got some really some of
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.680]  the most astute piercing views reading my cases that even some of my lawyers do
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:35.240]  and you're not in the cases so so you can speak to it obviously they can't
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:40.360]  before I do that I mentioned Owen yesterday in in DC there's so many of
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:43.880]  these clubs we can't even play them all here here's just one guy there's a if
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:47.320]  you're ready listen there's a big giant rat on trailer he walks over oh what's
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:53.840]  this giant rat nut job left his meltdown eats info or reporters Mike over nothing
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:58.720]  and so here it is ladies and gentlemen you know I'd like to speak to the
[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:04.880]  creator of said rat and let's see what he has a giant rat with drum set on it
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:09.920]  should be interesting wow
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:15.000]  let this always create like a straw man like a plant fascism or rat and they're
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.720]  like then that's you is literally the person who approached the idol they get
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:23.440]  mad here we go that's destroying innocent men right now so they're fighting
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:28.280]  fascism by standing up for fascism I mean if you want to fight fascism that's
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:33.160]  what you do you support a fascist dictatorship is this your design sir so
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:39.640]  you like fascism I don't like fascists I don't like info wars I don't like young

[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:37.120]  for the for the for the uh the lens let's stop right there the full videos on
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:41.480]  enforce.com this guy doesn't want to be interviewed for his big rat he wants to
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:45.320]  flip out on somebody speech and try to stop it so it's beyond him to try to
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:50.720]  extreme their own derangement trying to provoke it with the public that's in the
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.640]  documents into derangement has now made them derange correct and what they do is
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:57.480]  projection it's sort of the old mirror principle so I tell people if you're
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:00.680]  with somebody and somebody's making some crazy argument or accusation against
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:04.640]  you often and it doesn't make any sense just go and replace the you with an I
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:07.840]  and they'll often be confessing they'll often be telling you their whole story
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:11.280]  and that's precisely what's happening here the left is accusing people like you
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.800]  of doing what they are doing the just like this guy is this guy is accusing the
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:19.360]  reporter of being the fascist getting into his face when he's the one acting
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:22.480]  in a fascistic manner and getting into his face he's the one being sort of
[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:25.760]  physical with him he's the one attacking equipment he's the one doing all that
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:29.560]  activity while accusing the other person of doing it and this is a pattern in
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:33.320]  practice modus operandi with the ideological left is to accuse the other
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:37.000]  of that which they themselves do to use the legal system inappropriately and
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.240]  improperly to attack others for what they themselves should be sued for for the
[02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:44.840]  justice day themselves and they've all been trained the same where they get
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:47.960]  physical it doesn't work they back off they're trying to get you to attack
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:51.200]  them so they can sue you correct exactly it's all about instigations all about
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:54.720]  provocation it's old-school tactics old-school techniques going all the way

[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:44.520]  radio host good friend of mine and he was bringing up how people like Howard
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:49.360]  Stern now say Alex Jones doesn't deserve free speech now last year in
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:53.520]  August when I got the platformed at first he did some fake spoof pieces and
[02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:59.120]  I've been on the show before they were more good-hearted now he's doing spoof
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:03.520]  pieces with these comedians that can you know my voice pretty damn well they
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:07.240]  would use exact things I say it makes it with lies so that I say nobody died at
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:11.360]  Sandy Hook and I'm bullying dead kids and then I get sued for saying things I
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:14.480]  haven't said but they don't get sued for making jokes I say they have a free
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:19.320]  speech right to do that but we have Robert Barnes of at Barnes underscore law

[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:32.120]  have this thing under control I'll stop there I haven't plugged this hour so I
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:35.960]  thought let Howard Stern plug for us there's no lead there's no concrete in
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:39.960]  our products that's what they do though they make a big joke out of it we are
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:43.320]  listening supported it is the last week it's from no vitality there's just known
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:47.080]  cold-pressed herbs super high quality we can't even get any more because it's

[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:31.640]  turbo force and in force live comm or triple a 253 3139 you know it's funny
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:35.880]  hearing them parody my voice particularly what I'm horse right now and the
[02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:39.160]  thing you know I'm not the parody I'm not the real one but it is a little bit
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:42.520]  crazy but Robert Barnes attorney-at-law you just put up with that plug there
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:46.840]  brought to us by Howard Stern getting specifically into your view just reading
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:50.600]  over the different Sandy Hook suits and others even the statesman last week said
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:55.320]  it's an incredible suit they admit he never said the people's names correct
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:58.000]  and it's a major problem for example compare it and contrast it to the
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:02.240]  Covington case so in the Covington case they identified the individuals they
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:05.680]  identified them by their visual image they shared links that identified to
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:09.200]  them they shared the school they were at the location they were at and then they
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:12.840]  put out a photo shot and then they asked for them to be doxxed all across the
[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:16.520]  country like they didn't exactly and then the violence threats came after that
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:20.960]  and then by contrast compared to what the accusations are in your case so in
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:24.360]  your case there's no accusation of identifying anybody by name identifying
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:28.760]  anybody by their photograph identifying anybody by their address identifying
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:31.960]  anybody by any kind of information that could lead to any of these individuals
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:35.360]  being identified at all in fact the skepticism that was voiced was voiced
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:38.760]  over whether the investigation is being done honestly and other aspects but
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:41.680]  there was no aspect that has been alleged in the complaint or that's
[02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:45.040]  documented in any of the legal claims that show that there was any attempt to
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:49.400]  in any way harass any individual or even name them or even show their image or
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:53.000]  even show their home or even show their location or even videotape them outside
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.840]  of their home and they admit that in some of the suits which is well like you
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:39:59.720]  said I love my lawyers they should have put that up front in the briefs it's key
[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:02.800]  to highlight that because I think a lot of people have misunderstood that aspect
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:05.240]  because some people asked me they said okay mr. Barnes representing the
[02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:09.600]  Covington kids the you know mr. Jones do you think the the cases are similar and
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:12.740]  I'm like no they're not that radically opposite in the Covington case they
[02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:15.840]  identified them by their photograph they put their photograph everywhere they
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:19.000]  put them up in a photo but they called it a hit list the photographic hit list
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.320]  and it just happened it wasn't eight years ago exactly and they're doing it
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:24.640]  everywhere and they're doing it broad-scale and they're doing it wholesale
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:28.520]  they're doing it pervasively by contrast none of that happened here even the
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:32.240]  lawyers on the other side didn't even allege it they didn't even claim it then
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:36.240]  in fact they bury it like paragraph 88 they say well because any question was
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:39.480]  ever raised about anything that might have happened in Sandy Hook that by
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:43.520]  definition is libel that's not the law the law is you in order to be libel you
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:46.520]  individually have to be targeted that's what happened in Covington they were
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:50.200]  individually targeted there was a request to docs those individuals whose
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:54.120]  photograph and video was shared around the entire world who the media linked to
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:57.440]  who the media said go here and look at who these people what are they thinking
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:02.240]  I you know I think what their their approach is basically to to if they
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:06.080]  could destroy you destroy your legacy destroy your history destroy your
[02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:09.800]  audience's right to hear independent viewpoints from you they think they can
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:13.360]  destroy the bill that's it they're really tired in the audience so they all
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:16.520]  feel alone you read the WikiLeaks it's like we must make right wingers and
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:19.960]  nationals feel alone we must not let them have a community and and beyond
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:23.920]  anything info wars is like a coral reef where the listers are the fish and I'm
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:27.760]  just a coral and you know we're all ecosystem and they don't want us to have
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:31.040]  a home and precisely they don't want independent voices to be out there they
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:34.200]  don't want anybody raising questions about the political establishment raising
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:37.240]  questions about the media establishment raising questions about the corporate
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:40.600]  establishment in the same way look at this case this is a case that easily
[02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:44.000]  could have disappeared if there was an independent journalist independent
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.600]  press out there raising questions showing what the truth is these kids lives
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:51.440]  could have been ruined over a lie but for the ability of the independent press
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:55.000]  to raise the right questions to challenge and contest the establishment
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.720]  narrative they want to suppress your voice has been an info wars voice has
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:03.120]  been one of the most loudest clearest voices for an independent dissident
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:06.240]  political viewpoint out there against the establishment press going on two
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:10.320]  decades if they can suppress and quash your voice then what they can do is kill
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:14.280]  the audience's right to decide who they want to listen to the audience is right
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:18.520]  to decide what's true the audience is right to inquire and investigate and
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:22.040]  raise questions and to establish what their truth is and that their goal isn't
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:25.040]  to so much control you because you could retire tomorrow go to the Caribbean
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:28.280]  their goal is to control your audience so that they are not allowed to think
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:32.320]  independently and freely for themselves and it's so simple but you may it's
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:36.800]  true they're trying to control people can hear that's they're insulting people
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:40.960]  saying they're a bunch of idiots and they can't be trusted to actually listen
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:45.280]  and see different ideas exactly that that's the goal the goal is to control the
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:48.920]  listener not to control the speaker but to control the listener and prevent them
[02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:51.680]  from knowing their truth and deciding their own truth how do we go on the
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:54.840]  offense we'll ask that question

[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:14.480]  well I was thumbing from Montgomery I had my guitar on my back when a stranger
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:21.520]  stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac and he was dressed like 1950 half
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:27.520]  drunk and hollow eyed he said it's a long walk to Nashville would you like to ride
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:34.560]  show. Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:41.320]  front lines of the info war. I sat down in the front seat and turned on the radio and
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:46.240]  them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid. Robert Barnes is our
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:50.760]  guest. Then I noticed a stranger was ghost white pale when he. Robert you've
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:55.240]  looked at the lawsuits against us and you say the same thing my lawyer say this
[02:47:55.240 --> 02:47:59.400]  is new law since it happened before but they think tens of thousands of fake
[02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:03.160]  news articles about what I supposedly done is gonna carry this through but the
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:07.640]  Connecticut case they go give us your business model on Sandy Hook there's no
[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:11.240]  business model about the news you're gonna say or what you're gonna cover
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:15.920]  your views we didn't have some pre-meeting about it and it's the same
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:20.200]  thing there is no marketing information on Sandy Hook they're saying my whole
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:25.000]  life of Sandy Hook when it's not even one-tenth of one one hundred percent but
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:30.120]  you were off air talking about how crazy that suit is where again they just think
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:33.560]  well we've got Connecticut well we've got you know we'll get this text and we'll
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:37.120]  put him up here we'll show him how the world works and to me it's just a
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:39.360]  travesty for this country I don't even really worried about it because I know
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:42.800]  what I said when I did versus what they said well the interesting thing is
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:45.600]  they're really challenging everything you've ever said so they're trying to
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:49.960]  say that every accusation ever made by anybody at InfraWars all of it is fake
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:52.960]  all of it is false when they know otherwise and I think part of it is
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:55.200]  because that's how they want to brand the business model part of it's probably
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:59.200]  because some of the lawyers who drafted it really think that the homeland version
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:03.280]  of Alex Jones is true on Showtime instead and what that affords it opens the
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:06.360]  door to some people who probably never watched that show but I watch
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:11.160]  ballgowns of it and exactly everybody thinks that's really me that's that's
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:14.680]  the corporate media exactly that that's the entirely fake version of who you are
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:17.520]  but the interesting thing is it really opens the door for you to get to prove
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:21.720]  some things that have not you've never had the the court access to do so for
[02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:25.320]  example they've made certain accusations about things that were said about John
[02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:29.720]  Podesta or Tony Podesta were said about David Brock imagine when I show the
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:34.920]  jury Tony Podesta in the Washington Post with pictures of naked kids well
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:38.400]  that it really affords and opens the door to you to ask for to do depositions of
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:41.560]  third-party individuals so you should have a right to do discovery of John
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:46.280]  Podesta do discovery of Tony Podesta do discovery of David Brock find out about
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:48.560]  some of their rather interesting histories and some of the things they've
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:51.360]  been up to politically and all of these other people that have done very
[02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:55.120]  and find out about the kids in the hot tub but find out about all of it but find
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:58.000]  out about all the details of all of these individuals what really happened
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.800]  because they're claiming that none of those things ever happened that not
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:03.800]  only that they make certain statements about Sandy Hook but they claim any
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:07.560]  accusation that has ever been made by info wars against anybody in a position
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:12.120]  of power privilege is not true well you exactly they say that we sit around a
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:16.560]  boardroom and go what is the most hurtful thing we can say let's do it and
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:22.200]  then meanwhile that's not the case but then is that because with the Democrats
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:25.640]  of the establishment we know they have meetings then plan stuff so I guess they
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:28.920]  think we're doing the same thing correct I think that they basically project
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:32.120]  it's amazing how easy it is to understand what their mindset is by just
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:34.680]  putting on to them with you kept saying like a dinner you said listen this is
[02:50:34.680 --> 02:50:37.680]  I figured out if I just go off what they're accusing me of they're giving
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:40.520]  me a roadmap of who they are precisely it's extraordinary it's a very
[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:43.600]  predictive of these kind of sociopathological individuals and
[02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:46.520]  institutions and so you take that you look at it you put it back on them
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:49.000]  and they'll give you roadmap of who they are and what they're about and what
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.440]  they've really done and they haven't realized they've done this the people
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:55.080]  orchestrating this hit job against you through lawfare they don't realize they've
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:58.760]  opened the door to you to be able to use a discovery process and the judicial
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:02.960]  process to get inquiry to get depositions to get discovery into what they
[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:05.600]  have been up to it's well I only talked to you for the first time like a week
[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:09.200]  ago on air we had dinner last night but for me it was like an epiphany a month
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:13.320]  ago what you'd already learned from experience is I went oh my god but
[02:51:13.320 --> 02:51:17.600]  they're accusing me of is what they're all doing and it was very comforting not
[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:21.000]  in a good way because that was before like what are they that dumb no they
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:25.640]  literally are operating like I'm them and then I had understanding of them and
[02:51:25.640 --> 02:51:28.760]  since that happened it's been like incredible absolutely and what it does
[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:32.440]  is these open the door to sort of powerful tools like otherwise would be
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:35.480]  difficult to say there's even the right to subpoena various government
[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:38.840]  connected individuals and entities to what they've been up to because many of
[02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:42.360]  the things that have been predicted and forecast that by info wars over time has
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:45.400]  proven to be accurate we find that out with iPhone and its ability to use
[02:51:45.400 --> 02:51:49.560]  FaceTime to spy on people just yesterday you are me exactly things that you were
[02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:52.440]  talking about many years ago well this affords the opera they're trying to
[02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:55.600]  pretend that nothing you ever said was accurate this affords the opportunity to
[02:51:55.600 --> 02:51:58.400]  present it to a jury so their prosecution is everything ever said was
[02:51:58.400 --> 02:52:01.440]  false let's show them a hundred things that happen exactly let's prove that
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:05.480]  it's true and let's use the powerful tool the judicial discovery process that
[02:52:05.480 --> 02:52:08.480]  they're trying to do to invade your privacy to actually inquire into
[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:11.800]  relevant factual material information about what they've been up to I mean
[02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:15.200]  about the scope of what you know Tony Podesta's involvement in everything
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:18.200]  that's related to the Mueller investigation and inquiry that you
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:21.480]  they're suggesting some aspects of that are inaccurate well then let's sit down
[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:24.960]  Tony Podesta and do a full two-day three-day deposition and let's see what
[02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:27.520]  the facts are and help by the way I'd love to say I'm an originator most stuff
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:32.440]  the New York Times wasn't as bad as they are now ten years ago 2005 they had
[02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:36.720]  Hillary Clinton's Russian problem and it was all about this deal and the FBI
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:39.400]  being shut down correct and really because they're saying that those
[02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:43.040]  accusations are fake well then this is an opportunity to do discover the facts
[02:52:43.040 --> 02:52:46.360]  let's do I mean I had a case where what I kept saying throughout the case was the
[02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:48.800]  very first witness I was going to call was Hillary Clinton in the second was
[02:52:48.800 --> 02:52:51.640]  going to be Bill Clinton and ultimately we got a good outcome in that case
[02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:55.040]  because everybody in the system was desperate to avoid those people ever
[02:52:55.040 --> 02:52:59.240]  being having to testify but but you're right they brought all these people in
[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:03.520]  right they did it not us exactly it's their accusation their accusation is
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:07.280]  don't believe anything in four wars has ever talked about simply because we want
[02:53:07.280 --> 02:53:11.000]  to con controversial eyes and improperly describe what happened with related to
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:14.040]  Sandy Hook they don't want to talk about the Podesta's they don't want to talk
[02:53:14.040 --> 02:53:16.840]  about all of these other scandals that other people have been involved in the
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:20.840]  various dark arts that David Brock has been involved in for a long time they
[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:23.840]  don't want that put under scrutiny but they've invited that scrutiny by claiming
[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:26.760]  that all of those statements are inaccurate that all of those claims are
[02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:31.120]  inaccurate well I'm not Mackey of Valley and I'm trying to put personal to
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:35.400]  figure but I can see what you're saying now that they have brought all this out
[02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:38.840]  and done all this that what are they going to do with it when they actually
[02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:42.680]  get challenged all these points exactly the if they want to prove the all of
[02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:45.680]  these things are fake and false let's put it to the test let's put it to the
[02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:48.520]  evidentiary test let's put it to the discovery test let's put it to the
[02:53:48.520 --> 02:53:52.760]  deposition test they can all swear and let an ordinary jury of 12 ordinary
[02:53:52.760 --> 02:53:55.920]  everyday people who aren't fans of the show or critics critics of the show
[02:53:55.920 --> 02:53:59.480]  decide what the truth is let's put it all out there everything that has nothing
[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:03.320]  to do with Sandy Hook but exactly how they put it all on trial using with that
[02:54:03.320 --> 02:54:06.120]  children correct because they're the ones using the kids not me correct they
[02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:09.240]  want to talk about this marginal little piece where they're misrepresenting what
[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:12.520]  happened what but they're the ones who are saying everything else that does
[02:54:12.520 --> 02:54:15.760]  well they're also saying I got famous of Sandy Hook and it's this big thing no
[02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:19.520]  they're the ones using my name and Sandy Hook to keep bringing it back up and
[02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:22.320]  saying I'm doing it correct the reality is that none of the names of any
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:24.920]  individual family member would have been known but for the suit and but for the
[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:28.520]  publicity relating to the suit because info wars had nothing to do with it but
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:30.720]  what they really want to do is scandalize everything else that has
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:34.560]  nothing to do with Sandy Hook they want people to say only look here don't look
[02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:38.280]  at all of the other places where accurate information was disclosed where
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:41.560]  questions were critically asked that needed to be imagined showing a jury
[02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:46.200]  babies being thrown incubators brains bashed out and then ABC News admitting it
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:50.120]  was fake and launching a war that killed millions or all these declassified
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:54.480]  examples of mass events that didn't happen and then saying we're not supposed
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:58.240]  to question it exactly think if there had been an info wars in the 1950s who
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:01.720]  would have exposed that Harvard was connected to an MK ultra project doing
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:04.760]  experiments psychological experiments on young college students because one of
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:07.720]  those young college students was Ted Kaczynski maybe Ted Kaczynski doesn't
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:11.280]  become the unabomb maybe that never happens so the reality is exposing
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:14.920]  government misconduct and bad deeds by those in power usually ends up saving
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:18.720]  lives or just kidding imagine if spying the 50 said when it first started they're
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:22.320]  secretly injecting black people civilists to spread it to kill black people
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:26.000]  no one would believe it that but no later it was proven right absolutely we
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.920]  talk about in terms of the involvement like now on snowfall a show that's a
[02:55:28.920 --> 02:55:33.000]  popular show on mainstream media talks about the CIA's role with crack cocaine
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:36.080]  and the drug distribution in their cities the reality is but the reporter
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:39.400]  who covered that ended up dead very well exactly so what if that had been
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:42.600]  covered what if info wars have been bet around by what they called him a cook in
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:45.960]  a nut he never backed down he's proved right exactly but they demonized them
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:49.400]  in the process they destroyed I talked to him two weeks before he died he said
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:52.520]  I'm moving I've got all the proof my new books coming out I he sent us a disc
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:56.400]  that's somewhere around here that was like all his reportage he wanted me to
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:00.520]  build him a new website and he was dead two gunshots the head they said I was
[02:56:00.520 --> 02:56:03.560]  totally normal exactly I mean the that's why it's critical that we have
[02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:06.720]  dissident outsider voices raising questions about establishment press and
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:09.920]  establishment power because otherwise the truth never comes out that doesn't
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:12.040]  mean you're gonna have a perfect track record that doesn't mean everything's
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:15.440]  gonna be accurate but we need those questions flying to come on here and
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:19.560]  lie exactly and that's clear it's what they're doing they they go in every day
[02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:23.400]  planning to lie about people planning to lie about president Trump planning to
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:26.760]  lie about the kind of people who support him so they project that onto all of
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:29.920]  their critics and dissidents they project that on to everybody raising
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:33.040]  questions about them clearly people in the political right have cared more
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:36.960]  about accuracy honesty and truth than anybody in the establishment press has
[02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:41.760]  for a very very long time you can have all these opinions it's like show us
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:45.760]  the meeting where you plan the hoax give us the document it's like asking for
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:50.360]  your unicorns it just isn't there they don't get it and they don't realize at
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:53.840]  all that they've bought their own lie they fed a lie it's like the old joke
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:57.080]  about a salesman they have a tendency to buy their own ad these are the left has
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:57:00.280]  bought their own lie in this case but that's the advantage that it potentially
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:03.400]  affords you and it fords you to prove the truth a lot of allegations have
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:06.320]  nothing to do with Sandy Hook that they're now saying are not accurate you
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:09.280]  get to prove the accuracy of by having very important and influential people
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:12.040]  have to swear under oath to what happened we come back you've looked at my
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:16.320]  Virginia case too I'm being sued for saying that Soros funded Antifa the
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:19.040]  police stood down they attacked the right-wing group most of the feds has
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:23.680]  been admitted so Soros it's his fault for the melee that killed the woman they
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:27.240]  then sue me saying that I say a photographer that was there killed the
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:32.800]  woman I never even said that never even said his name but again what is the
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:37.000]  end game of this it's incredible we'll be right back in two minutes final

[02:59:11.480 --> 02:59:15.680]  globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not
[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:20.840]  pesky in the future I want to be troublesome and pesky I want to keep
[02:59:20.840 --> 02:59:25.320]  going I want to make them do the ultimate not just destroy us financially I
[02:59:25.320 --> 02:59:29.920]  want to push all the way I've committed to do that I've prayed for that and I've

[02:59:48.320 --> 02:59:53.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:59:53.680 --> 03:00:10.800]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:15.760]  Robert Barnes is in Fuego on air but he's really volcanic off air so we're
[03:00:15.760 --> 03:00:19.120]  people you just send that last break to viewers about just the whole attack on
[03:00:19.120 --> 03:00:22.880]  info wars and what it shows the real opportunities we've got me because they
[03:00:22.880 --> 03:00:25.720]  have put the entire info wars business model at issue and because they're
[03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:28.640]  challenging and contesting literally everything that has ever been said
[03:00:28.640 --> 03:00:31.840]  that's come out of the studio they're affording you the opportunity to verify
[03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:34.760]  and prove those things they're affording so for example people like John
[03:00:34.760 --> 03:00:39.440]  Podesta people like Tony Podesta people like David Brock who have never been
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:42.400]  meaningfully deposed in a lot of different cases about various issues and
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:45.720]  allegations concerning their misconduct and malfeasance over the years various
[03:00:45.720 --> 03:00:50.040]  lobbying issues various of personal issues various issues of allegations that
[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:53.280]  have been raised concerning them let's have the opportunity to fully vet those
[03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:56.640]  let's say issue subpoenas they're affording you the opportunity to
[03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:59.080]  subpoena them for the purpose of deposition for the purpose of
[03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:02.600]  discovery to prove that the media wants to say that everything in fours as ever
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:05.960]  said is false prove the opportunity to present to a jury the evidence that
[03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:08.440]  proves that many of the accusations none of which have anything to do with
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:11.960]  Sandy Hook are in fact true and accurate facts that concerned government
[03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:15.080]  misconduct of powerful people in privileged positions who have used and
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:18.720]  abused that power that power and that privilege to probably help propagate and
[03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:21.920]  be behind the scenes and part of this litigation that is mostly brought for
[03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:25.120]  reasons that appear to be dubious on their face because the individuals who
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:28.640]  are suing have never been harassed by anybody at info wars have never been
[03:01:28.640 --> 03:01:32.280]  targeted have never been identified have never been personified none of that has
[03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:36.240]  happened it is what happened to the people in Covington totally different
[03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:39.360]  radically different case so somebody has a political agenda but their political
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:42.960]  agenda is to suppress the audience is right to hear your voice and as part of
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:46.280]  that they've opened the door to discovery into their behavior into their
[03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:49.520]  email into their just into their financial activity to their business
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:53.240]  activity what have who's been funding what look at the Stormy Daniels case
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:57.520]  Stormy Daniels had to pay a huge amount to Trump as part of anti-slap fees where
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:00.840]  these individuals who were brought in to file the claim where they promised that
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:04.200]  they would be indemnified against any anti-slap fees that they may have to owe
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:08.040]  or have to pay given that they their individual names had never been liable
[03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:11.560]  to defame so that will be part of the case so they've opened the door to get
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:15.200]  into who is really behind this who's really waging the law fair who's really
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:18.880]  trying to use the leap misuse the legal system to propagate a political gender
[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:22.760]  and suppress dissident voices and let's get into the verifiable facts the
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:25.560]  evidence-supported facts concerning the various kind of malfeasance and
[03:02:25.560 --> 03:02:29.000]  misfeasance that has taken place by privileged people in power for a long
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:32.480]  time connected to sort of the Clinton cabal but also connected to other
[03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:35.840]  institutional players who want to suppress and censor speech through
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:40.160]  shaming individuals that are dissonant in that speech so do you think these law
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:43.080]  firms which they basically admit are being fun about the Democratic Party
[03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:48.320]  didn't get it by trying to make this the crucifixion of independent media that
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:51.960]  they would then draw in all the things we were talking about because I mean
[03:02:51.960 --> 03:02:55.080]  really pull back from it what they're doing is pretty breathtaking every law
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:58.480]  that looks at it says this is the crappiest made-up thing we've ever seen
[03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:02.760]  most of it is defamatory it's me but I guess it's in a court document so they
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:06.840]  think it's safe and generally if you get to you do have a certain court legal
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:09.640]  privilege it's sort of like the legislative privilege so you can't be
[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:12.120]  sued for defamation or libel but what they've done is they've opened the door
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:15.240]  they've said that all the accusations that ever concerned the Podestas were
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:18.600]  inaccurate effectively that's often what's in the complaint that's it like
[03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:21.480]  takes up 40 paragraphs but what's fascinating about the legal complaint is
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:24.160]  how little of it has anything to do with the individuals we're bringing the
[03:03:24.160 --> 03:03:27.880]  claim almost not about Sandy Hook it's about pedophilia doesn't exist correct
[03:03:27.880 --> 03:03:30.120]  it's about that none of these bad people have ever done anything bad in their
[03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:33.520]  lives they're trying it's like why are they going on and on about the various
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:37.200]  with the weird emails that Wicca leaks expose concerning the Podestas what why
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:39.600]  do they go into that's like that's nothing to do with Sandy Hook why are
[03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:42.960]  they discussing that so it seems odd seems peculiar and what they're trying to
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:46.480]  do is say every accusation every allegation ever made by info wars what
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:50.600]  they're saying is if you talk about Alistair Crowley and spirit cooking and
[03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:57.040]  Bill Maher and kid love, we're gonna see you. Right if you get into anything that
[03:03:57.040 --> 03:04:00.440]  embarrasses people in privilege and power then they're going to try to
[03:04:00.440 --> 03:04:04.400]  silence and censor and shame that speech and that appears to be what the real
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:07.600]  objective is. But instead this could become like the big bug zapper or the
[03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:12.560]  Lay's target politically they've opened it up now and now I had a gut feeling
[03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:15.520]  about a month ago I was thinking about this I think this is their water loo
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:18.400]  now I think they've actually stuck their foot in it I don't say that is some
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:23.520]  confidence game here I think it's over for them a lot of respects that they've
[03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:26.840]  opened the door that they didn't realize they bought into their own nonsense in
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:30.280]  their own sort of caricatured portrait of who you were and in the process they
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:33.320]  ignored the real evidence and the real evidence implicates a lot of bad actors
[03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:36.280]  and a lot of positions of privilege and power that need to be exposed for what
[03:04:36.280 --> 03:04:39.760]  they've done. Robert Barnes attorney-in-law we're gonna take a little

[03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:12.640]  I gotta be honest, I get tired from work, everything else, I'm usually bored at dinner,
[03:08:12.640 --> 03:08:13.800]  even though I'm talking to really smart people.
[03:08:13.800 --> 03:08:17.800]  But Robert Barnes last night, I was like, man, this guy on every angle, because I've
[03:08:17.800 --> 03:08:19.800]  played a lot of history, a lot of politics.
[03:08:19.800 --> 03:08:23.440]  On every topic, I bring up different people, different topics, and he had like the inside
[03:08:23.440 --> 03:08:26.120]  baseball for my own research, but a little bit more.
[03:08:26.120 --> 03:08:27.120]  I was impressed.
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:30.320]  So we're going to be hearing a lot more from Robert Barnes here on the air if he'll do
[03:08:30.320 --> 03:08:31.320]  it.
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:32.320]  I know he's a busy guy.
[03:08:32.320 --> 03:08:35.840]  He obviously is representing some of the Covington kids and doing a great job, he represents
[03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:38.520]  Wesley Snipes and so many others, he's here with us.
[03:08:38.520 --> 03:08:42.680]  But he's been on for almost two hours, but we were talking about Roger's case last night
[03:08:42.680 --> 03:08:43.680]  in Russiagate.
[03:08:43.680 --> 03:08:51.720]  I'm going to do on that, so Roger Stone from DC indicted last week, arraigned Monday, Owen
[03:08:51.720 --> 03:08:53.840]  Shroyer, they're covering it live.
[03:08:53.840 --> 03:08:58.360]  I wanted to get your take on Russiagate and where you think it's going and your big insight
[03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:03.160]  into Robert Mueller, who I've done research on that nobody had this research like you've
[03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:07.160]  done the research and I'm actually related to his wife, which is not a good thing, I
[03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:11.480]  guess, going back to the Mayflower, but I guess we're like 20th cousins or something.
[03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:15.680]  But I'm not related to him though, I've done the family tree, but it's definitely some
[03:09:15.680 --> 03:09:17.080]  blue blood activity going on.
[03:09:17.080 --> 03:09:18.080]  Oh, no doubt.
[03:09:18.080 --> 03:09:22.080]  Manaford goes, I mean, the whole, all of the prosecution, the Mueller family goes all
[03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:25.640]  the way back to old money, old establishment money, back to New Amsterdam when New York
[03:09:25.640 --> 03:09:28.480]  was New Amsterdam, you know, the Princeton Dining Clubs, that whole environment.
[03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:33.160]  This guy was a very peculiar legal history from a political perspective.
[03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:36.640]  Somebody who's, he's sort of the deep state fixed man for the better part of three decades.
[03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:40.400]  A guy who's part of weird prosecutions that go in unusual ways.
[03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:44.200]  So I mean, here's a guy who was one of the top people for Bush in the early 90s, then
[03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:48.580]  he leaves, cashes in, makes a couple of million, then he goes and becomes a mid-level homicide
[03:09:48.580 --> 03:09:51.600]  prosecutor in the District of Columbia, which is a weird transition.
[03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:53.800]  You just don't see that normal resumes.
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:09:57.640]  And then all of a sudden, Bill Clinton, after he's there, after Mueller's there for a key
[03:09:57.640 --> 03:10:01.640]  several year juncture, suddenly Mueller gets one of the prime gigs, here's a Republican
[03:10:01.640 --> 03:10:05.920]  getting a prime gig as the Northern District of California head prosecutor, something every
[03:10:05.920 --> 03:10:07.880]  liberal Democrat in the country wanted.
[03:10:07.880 --> 03:10:09.080]  So the question is, how does that happen?
[03:10:09.080 --> 03:10:13.840]  How does he go from the DC homicide unit to being the United States attorney in the Northern
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:14.840]  District of California?
[03:10:14.840 --> 03:10:18.760]  Then he handles the Asimov case and who's the son of the famous science fiction writer.
[03:10:18.760 --> 03:10:21.400]  A lot of peculiar things happen connected to that case.
[03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:24.800]  Not long after that, all of a sudden he has a sweetheart gig, back as the director of
[03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:25.800]  the FBI.
[03:10:25.800 --> 03:10:27.360]  A lot of peculiar things happen then.
[03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:34.560]  I mean, you look at HSBC, BCCI, the Noriega case, you look at the various high-profile
[03:10:34.560 --> 03:10:37.520]  pedophile or the Epstein case, other high-profile cases.
[03:10:37.520 --> 03:10:41.520]  Somehow Mueller shows up, you look up at Whitey Bolger, you know, here Mueller is up in Boston
[03:10:41.520 --> 03:10:43.880]  while they're covering up for the bad activities of Whitey Bolger.
[03:10:43.880 --> 03:10:44.880]  How does that happen?
[03:10:44.880 --> 03:10:48.880]  How does this guy end up like Peter Sellers in that movie where he keeps showing up randomly
[03:10:48.880 --> 03:10:49.880]  and unbelievable?
[03:10:49.880 --> 03:10:50.880]  I was about to interrupt you.
[03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:54.280]  It's like in some movie where the devil always appears in a poof of smoke at the perfect
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:57.760]  time, it's like only one other guy, Donald Rumsfeld, does that.
[03:10:57.760 --> 03:11:01.960]  But Mueller, it's even worse, he like pops back in at key points.
[03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:02.960]  Correct.
[03:11:02.960 --> 03:11:06.520]  And it's always the cover up, I mean, both HSBC and BCCI were heavily involved in a
[03:11:06.520 --> 03:11:07.520]  coup.
[03:11:07.520 --> 03:11:10.120]  If something's threatening the deep state, he pops up.
[03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:11.120]  Exactly.
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:12.120]  Bob Mueller's the fix-it man.
[03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:13.120]  That's who he's been.
[03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:17.280]  He always looks for sin-goats and sacrifice offerings to satisfy and to protect the actual
[03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:20.920]  corruption that's institutional and runs deep within high-ranking positions, within the
[03:11:20.920 --> 03:11:22.600]  hierarchy of law enforcement.
[03:11:22.600 --> 03:11:25.040]  And his final sin-goat is Roger Stone.
[03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:26.040]  Absolutely.
[03:11:26.040 --> 03:11:27.040]  There's no doubt.
[03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:29.000]  Well, Counselor, it's your chance because we talked about Roger a lot last night.
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.800]  Roger, give us the latest developments, but meet Robert Barnes.
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:32.800]  He's pretty amazing.
[03:11:32.800 --> 03:11:37.880]  I've been listening, and I must say, Counselor, I'm very impressed with the depth of your
[03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:39.720]  knowledge of both the law and history.
[03:11:39.720 --> 03:11:45.480]  Though it's an honor for me to be on with you, you're looking at Mr. Mueller's latest
[03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:46.480]  target.
[03:11:46.480 --> 03:11:51.920]  Now, it's said that a federal prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich, but I'm really not
[03:11:51.920 --> 03:11:55.040]  all that interested in being Mr. Mueller's lunch.
[03:11:55.040 --> 03:11:59.000]  This has been an extraordinary honesty.
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  It's almost surreal.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:08.200]  I keep thinking it's a nightmare from which I will wake up after my arraignment yesterday,
[03:12:08.200 --> 03:12:15.200]  looking over at the prosecution table, finding two former aides and attorneys who work for
[03:12:15.200 --> 03:12:18.560]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:23.000]  The political bias in my prosecution is extraordinary.
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  Something that needs to be brought to the attention of the court.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:33.360]  I am assigned to a judge who was in the Manafort case, who rejected all of the legal arguments
[03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:41.080]  regarding the constitutionality of Mr. Mueller's appointment, his involvement in Uranium One
[03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:44.720]  and other issues.
[03:12:44.720 --> 03:12:51.240]  The scene outside the courthouse, however, was almost as bad as what I saw inside the
[03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:58.320]  courthouse in the sense that I have never seen a torrent of hate and violence like this
[03:12:58.320 --> 03:13:00.920]  in my 50 years in American politics.
[03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:04.080]  Well, the reason I kept Mr. Barnes here is he's really worried about you and all your
[03:13:04.080 --> 03:13:05.080]  lawyers are great.
[03:13:05.080 --> 03:13:06.080]  He thinks they're great.
[03:13:06.080 --> 03:13:10.640]  He's been following it, reading the cases, and he said, doesn't he know, and you know,
[03:13:10.640 --> 03:13:15.640]  this lady gags people, she shuts them down, and he was just surprised that up front that
[03:13:15.640 --> 03:13:17.640]  wasn't the main issue made in front of the magistrate.
[03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:18.640]  You want to comment?
[03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:19.640]  Yeah, I mean, I was surprised.
[03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:22.000]  The lawyers are always in the position, they're doing a very good job.
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:26.200]  But basically, it appears to me that Mueller has somehow coordinated in a way in which the
[03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:31.360]  same judge who handled the Manafort case, the same judge who was involved in efforts
[03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:35.360]  to misuse and abuse bail provisions to deal with Gaetz related to that case, where she
[03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:39.080]  prevented him from fundraising and other activity, a judge who's made very peculiar
[03:13:39.080 --> 03:13:40.080]  ruling.
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:41.080]  Basically, she's been nothing more than a robber.
[03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:42.440]  How does a judge say you can't pay for your defense?
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:45.640]  I mean, effectively, that's what she did, and not only that, but she did things that were
[03:13:45.640 --> 03:13:46.640]  basically a rubber stamp.
[03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:51.360]  It was the old Earl Long joke about Huey Long, someone, okay, Alan, once somebody blew a
[03:13:51.360 --> 03:13:55.520]  leaf across his desk and he signed it, that there's aspects of this judge that whatever
[03:13:55.520 --> 03:13:59.320]  Mueller has blown across her desk that she signs, even when it's not based on good law.
[03:13:59.320 --> 03:14:00.840]  Was this judge's compromise?
[03:14:00.840 --> 03:14:04.640]  I think if the judge who just is reflexively pro-government and won't be independent, and
[03:14:04.640 --> 03:14:06.200]  I think that's the concern.
[03:14:06.200 --> 03:14:11.040]  Well, in all honesty, the reason that they were able to judge shop in this case is by
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:19.640]  connecting my case to the case of the 17 Russian intelligence agents in which I was mentioned,
[03:14:19.640 --> 03:14:25.000]  although not accused of doing anything wrong, because of an innocuous communication, a benign
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.880]  communication with Gooseburg 2.0.
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:33.360]  So by connecting the two cases, they have judge shopped for this case.
[03:14:33.360 --> 03:14:37.400]  That's a question for my lawyers to address in due time.
[03:14:37.400 --> 03:14:42.760]  I imagine that there's not been a motion by the government to gag me yet, but I assume
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:43.760]  there will be.
[03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:48.200]  Well, that was Barnes' point is that, and it's my gut level thing, is I would go on
[03:14:48.200 --> 03:14:51.480]  the offense because she's already going to fry her ass.
[03:14:51.480 --> 03:14:54.440]  So if you go on the offense, in our experience, they'll only make some back down.
[03:14:54.440 --> 03:14:56.400]  Yeah, and I know that you could.
[03:14:56.400 --> 03:15:01.080]  I have certainly, I don't know what you would call the last 24 hours, but I've not exactly
[03:15:01.080 --> 03:15:02.080]  been a drinking pilot.
[03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:03.720]  No, I didn't say you're backing down.
[03:15:03.720 --> 03:15:06.160]  I'm saying them.
[03:15:06.160 --> 03:15:11.360]  You know, and obviously, Manifold did not appeal the gag rule put on him.
[03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:14.760]  To a higher court, he did not object.
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:16.880]  He also mounted no public defense.
[03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:23.000]  I generally think that when a person is accused of wrongdoing in public and they don't respond,
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:28.400]  they don't say, I'm not guilty, I'm innocent, I plead innocent, and now a defense, people
[03:15:28.400 --> 03:15:30.880]  assume, well, that guy's guilty.
[03:15:30.880 --> 03:15:31.880]  He was done available.
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:33.880]  Let's do one more statement, Roger, and you'll take over.
[03:15:33.880 --> 03:15:35.640]  I want to ask the question.
[03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:42.080]  This Mueller really winding this down and is Roger Stone, the cherry on top, the kudugra,
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:45.440]  the final dish, the cognac at the end of the long meal.
[03:15:45.440 --> 03:15:46.440]  We'll find out.
[03:15:46.440 --> 03:15:48.120]  My gut tells me they've just begun.
[03:15:48.120 --> 03:15:53.360]  They're going to wrap up, brush the gate, but launch a bunch of new fake investigations.
[03:15:53.360 --> 03:15:55.960]  You may need this herbal tea for relief right away.

[03:16:23.080 --> 03:16:28.480]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[03:16:28.480 --> 03:16:29.480]  the world.
[03:16:29.480 --> 03:16:32.480]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:38.480]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:42.280]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.280 --> 03:16:43.280]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:44.840]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.840 --> 03:16:51.400]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available

[03:19:10.720 --> 03:19:15.440]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases, and God knows what, are going to look back
[03:19:15.440 --> 03:19:18.280]  and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[03:19:18.280 --> 03:19:20.000]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:22.240]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:19:22.240 --> 03:19:26.000]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao

[03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:33.600]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:34.600]  ready to fight.
[03:19:34.600 --> 03:19:37.200]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:19:37.200 --> 03:19:39.200]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:19:39.200 --> 03:19:42.840]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[03:19:42.840 --> 03:19:44.040]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:19:44.040 --> 03:19:48.640]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[03:19:48.640 --> 03:19:51.280]  They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb.
[03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:52.400]  I want life.
[03:19:52.400 --> 03:20:10.160]  I want Jesus, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:10.160 --> 03:20:11.160]  She just grabbed my dick.
[03:20:11.160 --> 03:20:12.160]  Is that sexual assault?
[03:20:12.160 --> 03:20:13.160]  No.
[03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:14.160]  Is that sexual assault?
[03:20:14.160 --> 03:20:15.160]  Yes.
[03:20:15.160 --> 03:20:16.160]  So you just sexually assaulted me.
[03:20:16.160 --> 03:20:17.160]  I did assault you.
[03:20:17.160 --> 03:20:18.160]  Did you be arrested?
[03:20:18.160 --> 03:20:19.160]  Arrest me.
[03:20:19.160 --> 03:20:20.160]  I'm not going to arrest you.
[03:20:20.160 --> 03:20:21.160]  They're police officers right here.
[03:20:21.160 --> 03:20:22.160]  So look at this.
[03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:23.160]  Women have so much privilege.
[03:20:23.160 --> 03:20:28.160]  She can sexually assault me and get away with it.
[03:20:28.160 --> 03:20:50.600]  So we were talking about these crazy leftist.
[03:20:50.600 --> 03:20:56.200]  I told Owen Wiccan Apagoda, the women's march, this woman brutally grabbed his crotch, said
[03:20:56.200 --> 03:20:57.200]  it hurt pretty bad off air.
[03:20:57.200 --> 03:20:58.200]  He went like a wimp.
[03:20:58.200 --> 03:20:59.200]  He's not.
[03:20:59.200 --> 03:21:00.200]  That, you know, it was assault.
[03:21:00.200 --> 03:21:02.200]  And I said, well, you should tell the police.
[03:21:02.200 --> 03:21:04.960]  Well, it turns out they found out his name somehow.
[03:21:04.960 --> 03:21:12.400]  They called him and she's been arrested yesterday and Owen got the call today.
[03:21:12.400 --> 03:21:13.400]  He did a video on it.
[03:21:13.400 --> 03:21:18.040]  It's on info wars.com breaking liberal woman who grabbed info wars house for the crotch
[03:21:18.040 --> 03:21:20.560]  and said, I just assaulted you has been arrested.
[03:21:20.560 --> 03:21:24.040]  And look, in another world, I would want her arrested for that.
[03:21:24.040 --> 03:21:27.760]  But the fact that she's so arrogant, this is just what she deserves.
[03:21:27.760 --> 03:21:28.760]  Oh, no doubt.
[03:21:28.760 --> 03:21:32.900]  I mean, it shows a double standard and it shows a sort of reckless road conduct of individuals
[03:21:32.900 --> 03:21:35.320]  who think they can do anything they want, anytime they want.
[03:21:35.320 --> 03:21:38.800]  People who have a Harvey Weinstein mentality, it's not a surprise that Harvey Weinstein
[03:21:38.800 --> 03:21:39.920]  himself comes from the left.
[03:21:39.920 --> 03:21:42.480]  It's the same mentality just applied in different contexts.
[03:21:42.480 --> 03:21:47.660]  Roger, what do you make of your co-host of the war room having a guy eat his microphone
[03:21:47.660 --> 03:21:52.360]  yesterday and now this woman that assaulted him sexually, she's been arrested?
[03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:57.280]  Well, first he tried to spit on him and then he tried to eat his microphone.
[03:21:57.280 --> 03:22:04.240]  Alex, this is kind of reminiscent of the scene yesterday outside the U.S. district courthouse.
[03:22:04.240 --> 03:22:11.760]  I've in 50 years in politics, I've never seen this kind of hatred pushing, shoving, screaming,
[03:22:11.760 --> 03:22:12.760]  spitting.
[03:22:12.760 --> 03:22:18.280]  When I got in the car, spittle, completely rolling down the window, people pounding
[03:22:18.280 --> 03:22:21.080]  on the car, pounding on the car.
[03:22:21.080 --> 03:22:28.000]  I'm very grateful to the police officers from the DC Metropolitan Police and to the federal
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:31.240]  marshals who got me out of the building in one piece.
[03:22:31.240 --> 03:22:36.680]  This reminded me of Vice President Richard Nixon in Caracas, people rocking the car
[03:22:36.680 --> 03:22:39.120]  before we pulled away.
[03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:43.360]  Thanks to the head of my security team, I got out of there with my skin.
[03:22:43.360 --> 03:22:45.440]  I wanted to make a statement.
[03:22:45.440 --> 03:22:50.160]  There were, you know, 40 microphones out front, but I don't want to be Jack Ruby to
[03:22:50.160 --> 03:22:51.960]  be quite honest with you.
[03:22:51.960 --> 03:22:54.720]  And these people are perfectly capable of it.
[03:22:54.720 --> 03:23:00.440]  I'm also on probation, under the supervision of the court, and it's been made very clear
[03:23:00.440 --> 03:23:05.960]  that if his eye so much is spit on the sidewalk, I will be immediately incarcerated.
[03:23:05.960 --> 03:23:09.280]  I'm sure that Mr. Mueller would like nothing better.
[03:23:09.280 --> 03:23:12.640]  So I've never seen this kind of hatred.
[03:23:12.640 --> 03:23:20.080]  I watched Jared Holt from Right Wing Watch call one of my black supporters a stupid N-word.
[03:23:20.080 --> 03:23:22.560]  Gee, that's real tolerant for you leftists.
[03:23:22.560 --> 03:23:28.400]  I guess you can't fathom the idea of an African-American who holds conservative views.
[03:23:28.400 --> 03:23:29.400]  That's not allowed.
[03:23:29.400 --> 03:23:32.960]  What's happened is they've learned they're allowed to say and do things that nobody
[03:23:32.960 --> 03:23:35.520]  else can.
[03:23:35.520 --> 03:23:41.000]  That's unlike anything I've ever seen going out to a restaurant here trying to eat.
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:42.720]  I've basically given up on it.
[03:23:42.720 --> 03:23:49.800]  I am forced to eat in an undisclosed location in my room because every time I try to go
[03:23:49.800 --> 03:23:56.400]  outside to even shoot a video or for fresh air to even smoke a cigar, God forbid, I'm
[03:23:56.400 --> 03:24:00.800]  confronted by some crazed leftist who wants to kill me.
[03:24:00.800 --> 03:24:05.960]  Not just yell, you're a Russian traitor, you're a Russian spy, but people who want actual
[03:24:05.960 --> 03:24:07.560]  fisticuffs.
[03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:09.120]  This is where we are in America.
[03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:14.360]  This is what I'm looking for at the time between now and which I go to trial.
[03:24:14.360 --> 03:24:22.400]  So it is only through the help of many, many, many info warriors and other patriotic Americans
[03:24:22.400 --> 03:24:26.840]  going to StoneDefenseFun.com that I can afford security.
[03:24:26.840 --> 03:24:31.800]  Alex has helped me with security to save my life and the lawyers it's going to take
[03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:35.560]  to push back, as Mr. Barnes has said.
[03:24:35.560 --> 03:24:41.280]  Unlike Paul Manafort, who's a friend of mine and who was unfortunately convicted, I will
[03:24:41.280 --> 03:24:46.240]  mount a very vigorous defense because I am not guilty.
[03:24:46.240 --> 03:24:51.640]  And watching Governor Chris Christie, who hasn't read the transcripts of my testimony
[03:24:51.640 --> 03:24:56.880]  for the House Intelligence Committee, which comprises five of the seven counts, and who
[03:24:56.880 --> 03:25:04.800]  hasn't read the context of any of the emails which are wildly taken out of context to fabricate
[03:25:04.800 --> 03:25:07.760]  this indictment, is ready to declare me guilty.
[03:25:07.760 --> 03:25:08.760]  It's a done deal.
[03:25:08.760 --> 03:25:14.480]  I should just plead and maybe even testify against the president, which I'm not going
[03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:15.480]  to do.
[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:17.280]  We know you're not going to do that.
[03:25:17.280 --> 03:25:23.040]  Closing on here where you take over with Robert Barnes, I mean, I've said, how do we make
[03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:24.160]  it about what they're doing?
[03:25:24.160 --> 03:25:28.240]  I can't see how Mueller's involved with Uranium One and the Russians and how they get away
[03:25:28.240 --> 03:25:29.240]  with this.
[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:30.240]  Mueller doesn't want to lose.
[03:25:30.240 --> 03:25:32.520]  How do we let him know he's going to lose?
[03:25:32.520 --> 03:25:35.960]  You were surprised he went after Roger because it's not a very good case.
[03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:40.640]  No, as a general rule, Mueller generally avoids prosecution that are loseable cases.
[03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:42.920]  He avoids bringing him against certain kinds of lawyers.
[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:45.240]  He avoids bringing him against certain kinds of defendants.
[03:25:45.240 --> 03:25:49.400]  So I think that the fact that they brought this, maybe he just delegated it to the Clinton
[03:25:49.400 --> 03:25:52.520]  lawyers that are part of the team that's against Roger.
[03:25:52.520 --> 03:25:53.720]  Maybe that's what's going on.
[03:25:53.720 --> 03:25:55.960]  But I was surprised because it's not a strong case.
[03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:57.800]  This is entirely a process case.
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:02.760]  This case would not exist but for Mueller's investigation and the congressional investigation.
[03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:08.880]  The extravagant stretch to make this an obstruction case is very marginal on its face.
[03:26:08.880 --> 03:26:13.280]  And then the various perjury charges, there's no such thing as really perjury to Congress,
[03:26:13.280 --> 03:26:15.120]  frankly, if you've ever heard a congressional question.
[03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:17.480]  Because it's usually got 18 different subcomponents.
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:19.920]  If this happened, then this happened, then this thing, and then what if he did this?
[03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:22.680]  And so they're interpreting something that's extrapolating from something, that's interpreting
[03:26:22.680 --> 03:26:25.360]  something else that they're going to call that perjury.
[03:26:25.360 --> 03:26:28.760]  This makes the Barry Bonds case look like the dream perjury case of all time.
[03:26:28.760 --> 03:26:29.760]  So it's a bad case.
[03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:31.000]  It's a weak case.
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:34.080]  It's only being brought because he thinks he can control who the judge is.
[03:26:34.080 --> 03:26:36.800]  And he thinks he can control and have a very liberal jury.
[03:26:36.800 --> 03:26:39.920]  And he thinks that that will be enough to railroad Roger.
[03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:42.880]  And it's good to hear that Roger's got a lot of defense and a strong defense.
[03:26:42.880 --> 03:26:46.000]  But it's a case that really shouldn't have been brought by an ethical, honest prosecutor
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:47.360]  only pursuing truth.
[03:26:47.360 --> 03:26:53.480]  Do you think Roger is the last, last order?
[03:26:53.480 --> 03:26:57.560]  I think because Democrats took back the House, they think they can transfer this sort of
[03:26:57.560 --> 03:27:00.960]  constant inquisition to the Democratic committee members.
[03:27:00.960 --> 03:27:05.000]  And I think people like Adam Schiff and others, they think can effectively take over from
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:06.000]  Mueller.
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:08.000]  Mueller doesn't like to be in the constant middle of this.
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:11.080]  He's done an effective job covering up the various corruption and collusion that took
[03:27:11.080 --> 03:27:15.800]  place with the Intel agencies during the Obama administration and spying on our first presidential
[03:27:15.800 --> 03:27:19.120]  candidate during a campaign for all the accusations against Richard Nixon.
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:22.440]  He never did anything like that and was ever accused of doing anything like that, using
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:24.200]  the FBI, using the CIA.
[03:27:24.200 --> 03:27:26.080]  And they've diverted from Hillary and the Russians.
[03:27:26.080 --> 03:27:27.080]  So his job's done.
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:28.080]  Correct.
[03:27:28.080 --> 03:27:29.080]  Exactly.
[03:27:29.080 --> 03:27:30.080]  He's done his cover up campaign.
[03:27:30.080 --> 03:27:32.720]  And like you said, every time Trump doesn't go along with the neocons, suddenly Mueller
[03:27:32.720 --> 03:27:33.720]  flares up.
[03:27:33.720 --> 03:27:34.720]  Precisely.
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:38.080]  He's done his cover up job for Comey and crew and what they did.
[03:27:38.080 --> 03:27:42.360]  And I assume that Stone is that Rogers, the last sort of lackey for him to be able to
[03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:46.080]  prosecute the last sin goat that he can offer to the political establishment.
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:50.320]  The last person the Democratic media has hated for a long time as an excuse to cover for
[03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:53.080]  what he was really up to, which was cover up in Rogers.
[03:27:53.080 --> 03:27:57.440]  His prosecution is almost entirely a distraction from the fact that he was really there to
[03:27:57.440 --> 03:28:01.240]  that the Mueller's investigation was there to cover up for the institutional corruption
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:06.120]  of the hierarchy of the NSA, the CIA and the FBI that was politicized and weaponized under
[03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:08.640]  Obama in the last year against President Trump.
[03:28:08.640 --> 03:28:09.640]  That's what it's all about.
[03:28:09.640 --> 03:28:12.840]  That's why he had to, I mean, he had to, he went, he put Roger under massive macroscopic
[03:28:12.840 --> 03:28:17.120]  and microscopic scrutiny and all you come up with is an extrapolation of a perjury claim
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:19.560]  of a process crime that's weak on its face.
[03:28:19.560 --> 03:28:22.280]  That shows you how weak their claims were and their charges were.
[03:28:22.280 --> 03:28:26.040]  And it was all just done to cover up the collusion and corruption of the institutional operation
[03:28:26.040 --> 03:28:28.520]  against President Trump during the campaign.
[03:28:28.520 --> 03:28:33.640]  In FullWars.com, tomorrow's news today, Roger Stone takes over on the other side of the

[03:33:03.920 --> 03:33:24.960]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.960 --> 03:33:31.800]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:31.800 --> 03:33:35.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:40.880]  I'm broadcasting today from an undisclosed location in D.C. because if my moreabouts
[03:33:40.880 --> 03:33:46.520]  was known in all honesty, my life would most definitely be in danger.
[03:33:46.520 --> 03:33:53.160]  I want you to understand the vital importance of the InfoWars platform to my defense because
[03:33:53.160 --> 03:33:59.360]  it is only a matter of time before the mainstream media wants you to forget all about Roger
[03:33:59.360 --> 03:34:07.080]  Stone and the stunning raid on my home last Friday in which they used a larger force than
[03:34:07.080 --> 03:34:10.920]  that which was protecting our consulate in Benghazi.
[03:34:10.920 --> 03:34:18.840]  A larger force than was used to go in and capture and kill Bin Laden or Pablo Escobar
[03:34:18.840 --> 03:34:20.440]  or El Chapo.
[03:34:20.440 --> 03:34:23.280]  You see, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[03:34:23.280 --> 03:34:26.440]  We are the beacon of truth, the beacon of freedom.
[03:34:26.440 --> 03:34:32.320]  And this is the only place on the internet or on cable or on radio you'll be able to
[03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:37.720]  get the stone cold truth about what's really going on in my trial.
[03:34:37.720 --> 03:34:40.000]  That's why they want to take InfoWars down.
[03:34:40.000 --> 03:34:41.160]  They want to take me down.
[03:34:41.160 --> 03:34:46.840]  They want to incarcerate me, gag me, make sure that I can't defend myself.
[03:34:46.840 --> 03:34:52.360]  But under our constitution, if you have the right to remain silent, you also have the
[03:34:52.360 --> 03:34:55.160]  right to speak in your defense.
[03:34:55.160 --> 03:34:57.520]  And they will try to deprive me of that.
[03:34:57.520 --> 03:35:03.880]  But Owen Schroyer will know the truth, Alex Jones will know the truth, David Knight will
[03:35:03.880 --> 03:35:11.160]  know the truth, Rob Dew will know the truth, Millie Weaver will know the truth, and so
[03:35:11.160 --> 03:35:16.280]  many others, Jake Lloyd and others, they will tell you what's going on.
[03:35:16.280 --> 03:35:21.560]  Which is why it's vitally important for you to support the InfoWars platform.
[03:35:21.560 --> 03:35:28.040]  From the beginning, closing InfoWars down, wiping us off the digital platforms, taking
[03:35:28.040 --> 03:35:34.000]  us off Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Spotify, and so on.
[03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:40.840]  The assault on InfoWars by Google, by Apple, this is all part of the plan.
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:46.960]  Just as the arrest at my home last Friday and the efforts to incarcerate me so that
[03:35:46.960 --> 03:35:53.640]  I cannot speak to strip me of my first amendment rights, these are all parts of the same plan.
[03:35:53.640 --> 03:35:59.960]  So please go to the InfoWars.com store right now and make a generous contribution.
[03:35:59.960 --> 03:36:04.320]  Now we've got some great products, some of the cutting edge, nutraceuticals that are
[03:36:04.320 --> 03:36:10.720]  put together by the top rate team of scientists that work with Alex Jones, where we fuse
[03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:18.200]  the very best of ancient, Asian, oriental, herbology that's been in existence successfully
[03:36:18.200 --> 03:36:24.120]  for two centuries, and we bind that with some of the cutting edge, nutraceutical products
[03:36:24.120 --> 03:36:29.720]  that bring you the very best, all natural, effective products that you can find on the
[03:36:29.720 --> 03:36:31.920]  market today.
[03:36:31.920 --> 03:36:39.360]  You can go to Walgreens or CVS or Walmart, there are others, there are products at Whole Foods
[03:36:39.360 --> 03:36:45.120]  that sound like the products that you can buy at InfoWars, but you will get less in
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:49.800]  terms of volume and you will get less in terms of quality.
[03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:55.000]  So please go to the InfoWars.com site and look at one of our great products, whether
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:37:01.800]  it's super male vitality, the special Michael Zimmerman formula, or bodies, the very best
[03:37:01.800 --> 03:37:07.800]  turmeric formula, great for people, my sister's a waitress, she's on her feet eight hours
[03:37:07.800 --> 03:37:08.800]  a day.
[03:37:08.800 --> 03:37:13.360]  She complained constantly and she was taking mouths full of Advil, it wasn't doing the
[03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:14.360]  trick.
[03:37:14.360 --> 03:37:18.680]  I recommended bodies, she says the greatest thing she's ever taken.
[03:37:18.680 --> 03:37:23.040]  So I know this stuff works, that's a personal testimonial.
[03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:27.760]  And if you're not in the market for one of our great products, find the donate button
[03:37:27.760 --> 03:37:37.120]  on the InfoWars site, send us $25, $50, $100, $500, yes, some InfoWarriors have sent as
[03:37:37.120 --> 03:37:45.560]  much as $8,000 because the vibrance and the accessibility of the InfoWars platform are
[03:37:45.560 --> 03:37:48.120]  crucial to my defense.
[03:37:48.120 --> 03:37:56.800]  And then go over to StoneDefenseFund.com, StoneDefenseFund.com, you got to be very careful because there's
[03:37:56.800 --> 03:38:04.560]  Huxters out there, the Roger Stone LegalDefenseFund.com, that's not me, the StoneDefenseFund, that's
[03:38:04.560 --> 03:38:09.680]  not me, pardon me, the Stone LegalDefenseFund, that's not me, there's two places you can
[03:38:09.680 --> 03:38:17.760]  go that are authorized, StoneDefenseFund.com or WhoFramedRogerStone.com, although we know
[03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:19.760]  the answer to that.
[03:38:19.760 --> 03:38:23.960]  I want to shift to what Alex Jones was talking about because frankly, I'm tired of talking
[03:38:23.960 --> 03:38:33.200]  about my own case, it only brings me back to the stark future of repression that I face.
[03:38:33.200 --> 03:38:37.160]  The real question is, why are they doing this to me?
[03:38:37.160 --> 03:38:45.680]  While FBI Director James Comey lied under oath, Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General,
[03:38:45.680 --> 03:38:53.000]  the DeFacto Attorney General for the last two years, lied under oath, that the FBI Director
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:59.560]  Christopher Wray lied under oath to the Congress about whether President Trump was the subject
[03:38:59.560 --> 03:39:05.200]  of a secret counterintelligence investigation trying to prove that he was an active agent
[03:39:05.200 --> 03:39:07.960]  for the Russians, ridiculous.
[03:39:07.960 --> 03:39:14.480]  What about John Brennan, the psychopath former CIA Director who keeps threatening the president
[03:39:14.480 --> 03:39:20.920]  on Twitter, a man who personally approved the visas for a number of the hijackers in
[03:39:20.920 --> 03:39:26.040]  Saudi Arabia who came to this country and attacked America on 9-11?
[03:39:26.040 --> 03:39:34.920]  Or what about his conversion to radical Islam when he served as the CIA station chief in
[03:39:34.920 --> 03:39:35.920]  Rida?
[03:39:35.920 --> 03:39:42.080]  Or what about his lies to the Congress regarding whether the steel dossier that was paid for
[03:39:42.080 --> 03:39:47.480]  by Hillary Clinton's minions, money laundering campaign cash through a law firm and calling
[03:39:47.480 --> 03:39:53.480]  it legal fees, a violation of the law, far worse than anything Michael Cohen is charged
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:54.480]  with?
[03:39:54.480 --> 03:39:57.880]  Does he get away with lying to the Congress about that?
[03:39:57.880 --> 03:40:03.200]  Or lying about the fact that he had the Central Intelligence Agency break into the computers
[03:40:03.200 --> 03:40:10.400]  and spy on a Senate committee run by Diane Feinstein that was investigating the CIA's
[03:40:10.400 --> 03:40:15.760]  illegal use of torture, no prosecution of John Brennan?
[03:40:15.760 --> 03:40:21.960]  What about Hillary Clinton herself, talk about the destruction of evidence in her emails,
[03:40:21.960 --> 03:40:28.480]  her illegal email server, the lies about that server, telling the Congress and FBI,
[03:40:28.480 --> 03:40:36.080]  oh, I never emailed classified material, I never received classified material.
[03:40:36.080 --> 03:40:38.560]  Those are material lies.
[03:40:38.560 --> 03:40:45.000]  Those are consequential lies, but there is no prosecution of Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:52.960]  Or what about the greatest treasonous financial crime in American history in which the Russian
[03:40:52.960 --> 03:41:00.760]  energy company, board of directors, individually gave Bill and Hillary Clinton $145 million
[03:41:00.760 --> 03:41:08.160]  in contributions to their phony foundation at the very time that 20% of America's enriched
[03:41:08.160 --> 03:41:16.920]  uranium reserves were on the table for a shift of control to the Russian state.
[03:41:16.920 --> 03:41:23.280]  Crimes covered up, ironically, by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who knew that the
[03:41:23.280 --> 03:41:28.880]  Russian energy company had bribed various officials in the Obama administration, and
[03:41:28.880 --> 03:41:34.720]  Robert Mueller himself, who took the uranium samples to Stockholm as a courier for the
[03:41:34.720 --> 03:41:36.760]  Russians to inspect.
[03:41:36.760 --> 03:41:43.040]  That there is no investigation of these crimes, no investigation of their lies.
[03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:50.440]  Instead, they have manufactured a completely fabricated indictment of me.
[03:41:50.440 --> 03:41:53.400]  Am I the last hors d'oeuvre, perhaps?
[03:41:53.400 --> 03:41:58.120]  Or maybe they're going to get a full meal when they try to go after Alex Jones.
[03:41:58.120 --> 03:42:04.480]  Because in recent weeks, we have seen completely false allegations about Alex Jones, various
[03:42:04.480 --> 03:42:11.760]  media outlets claiming that he is a Russian asset, that he took money from the Russian
[03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:20.800]  front, the agency for research or whatever it is called, the claim that he was paid
[03:42:20.800 --> 03:42:27.560]  by RT, which was told to me by an obnoxious New York Times reporter, whole cloth, a lie,
[03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:30.320]  a bare faced lie, untrue.
[03:42:30.320 --> 03:42:37.120]  We'll be coming right back to talk about why it is Republicans, conservatives, lovers
[03:42:37.120 --> 03:42:42.840]  of freedom who are under attack by the Mueller investigation and the Justice Department, while
[03:42:42.840 --> 03:43:12.800]  the Clintons and their cronies, and Obama and his cronies, walk free among us.
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:42.280]  We'll see you in the next one.
[03:43:42.800 --> 03:43:57.040]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:43:57.040 --> 03:44:01.240]  Info wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[03:44:01.240 --> 03:44:04.240]  every faucet, shower and sink in your home.

[03:44:56.280 --> 03:44:58.000]  There is no set stasis.
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:44:59.240]  There is no managed system.
[03:44:59.240 --> 03:45:00.840]  There is no uncontenual.
[03:45:00.840 --> 03:45:04.120]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[03:45:04.120 --> 03:45:07.320]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.

[03:45:08.640 --> 03:45:09.640]  We'll be here forever.
[03:45:09.640 --> 03:45:10.720]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:45:10.720 --> 03:45:15.400]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back
[03:45:15.400 --> 03:45:17.600]  and say, you know, we struggled here.
[03:45:17.600 --> 03:45:18.600]  We made it.
[03:45:18.600 --> 03:45:19.920]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:45:19.920 --> 03:45:22.200]  But God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:25.880]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao
[03:45:25.880 --> 03:45:30.960]  Seitang, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff because God wants warriors
[03:45:30.960 --> 03:45:34.280]  that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight?
[03:45:34.280 --> 03:45:37.200]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:45:37.200 --> 03:45:39.200]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:45:39.200 --> 03:45:42.840]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[03:45:42.840 --> 03:45:44.040]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:45:44.040 --> 03:45:48.640]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[03:45:48.640 --> 03:45:51.280]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:45:51.280 --> 03:45:52.400]  I want life.
[03:45:52.400 --> 03:45:53.400]  I want Jesus.
[03:45:53.400 --> 03:45:55.360]  Listen, I'm just going to tell us or something right now.
[03:45:55.360 --> 03:46:00.040]  I think our best products, our bodies, ultimate tomb, reformula with a 95% or humanoid level
[03:46:00.040 --> 03:46:01.560]  that no other company got.
[03:46:01.560 --> 03:46:02.560]  Nobody else did.
[03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:05.000]  Because everybody else, they put in a little bit of product and then they do a bunch of
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:06.000]  advertising and promoted.
[03:46:06.000 --> 03:46:09.560]  The turmeric in this is 95% curcuminoid.
[03:46:09.560 --> 03:46:12.120]  Nobody else has that bright yellow school bus color.
[03:46:12.120 --> 03:46:13.120]  That's what you're looking for.
[03:46:13.120 --> 03:46:14.120]  It's got it.

[03:46:26.080 --> 03:46:28.000]  We asked for the ultimate fish oil as well.
[03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:29.000]  All three of those.
[03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:32.000]  The body, energy for healthy life, for brain, for heart.
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:33.000]  These are the best.
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:34.000]  infowarstore.com.
[03:46:34.000 --> 03:46:37.920]  And then don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we have our newest turbo force for folks in
[03:46:37.920 --> 03:46:42.600]  the military or doctors or our long haul truck drivers or airline pilots or whatever.

[03:46:47.640 --> 03:46:50.400]  Super strong, super healthy, super amazing turbo force.
[03:46:50.400 --> 03:46:52.320]  I believe it's become our number one best selling product.
[03:46:52.320 --> 03:46:57.840]  You need to try turbo force today.
[03:46:57.840 --> 03:47:12.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:12.960 --> 03:47:20.240]  And now the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Roger
[03:47:20.240 --> 03:47:21.240]  Stone.
[03:47:21.240 --> 03:47:22.240]  Welcome back.
[03:47:22.240 --> 03:47:34.400]  I'm Roger Stone, reaching you from an undisclosed location in our nation's capital.
[03:47:34.400 --> 03:47:40.960]  If I could tell you where I am and the radical left found out my life quite injured and quite
[03:47:40.960 --> 03:47:43.760]  honestly would be in danger.
[03:47:43.760 --> 03:47:46.680]  That's really where we are in America today.
[03:47:46.680 --> 03:47:52.640]  The unhinged, crazy loony left screaming for blood.
[03:47:52.640 --> 03:47:58.880]  The attacks on Owen Schreuer yesterday outside the courthouse, although I must admit I was
[03:47:58.880 --> 03:48:04.360]  gratified when a lady came up to me in the lobby of the hotel where I'm staying, which
[03:48:04.360 --> 03:48:13.200]  is a very well known hotel that starts with a T. She said how impressed and gratified
[03:48:13.200 --> 03:48:16.360]  she was to meet my son.
[03:48:16.360 --> 03:48:19.680]  And I thought for a moment, well, my son's not in Washington.
[03:48:19.680 --> 03:48:23.380]  And then I realized she's referring to Owen Schreuer.
[03:48:23.380 --> 03:48:28.800]  I was complimented and honored because he is a courageous journalist.
[03:48:28.800 --> 03:48:34.240]  He is fearless and he is out there on the streets confronting those who would take away
[03:48:34.240 --> 03:48:37.120]  my First Amendment rights.
[03:48:37.120 --> 03:48:41.480]  Now there's terrific pace up right now at the Gateway Pundit.
[03:48:41.480 --> 03:48:50.320]  I think it leads the page about the fact that when I was arrested, the FBI took my 71-year-old
[03:48:50.320 --> 03:48:51.320]  wife.
[03:48:51.320 --> 03:48:56.280]  She'll be very angry when she tells you that I said how old she is, but she doesn't look
[03:48:56.280 --> 03:48:57.280]  71.
[03:48:57.280 --> 03:48:58.720]  She's the light of my life.
[03:48:58.720 --> 03:49:05.480]  She's the rock that keeps me together in this incredible ordeal, she and my God.
[03:49:05.480 --> 03:49:10.760]  But they walked her out on the street in her nightgown in her bare feet at five o'clock
[03:49:10.760 --> 03:49:13.480]  in the morning, made her stand next to me.
[03:49:13.480 --> 03:49:16.560]  I was handcuffed, she at least was not.
[03:49:16.560 --> 03:49:18.960]  She is accused of no crime.
[03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:21.560]  She was not allowed to touch her cell phone.
[03:49:21.560 --> 03:49:26.720]  My children, my grandchildren were trying to reach her to make sure she was okay, having
[03:49:26.720 --> 03:49:33.400]  seen on the television that their father and grandfather had been arrested.
[03:49:33.400 --> 03:49:36.960]  But the FBI would not allow her to touch her phone all day.
[03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:39.280]  She's a practicing Buddhist.
[03:49:39.280 --> 03:49:41.400]  She's a Roman Catholic like me.
[03:49:41.400 --> 03:49:45.040]  Buddhism is a philosophy of peace.
[03:49:45.040 --> 03:49:49.400]  But she was not allowed to open her ga hansit or to chant.
[03:49:49.400 --> 03:49:56.320]  She had to essentially sit in the corner while the FBI went through every inch of my home,
[03:49:56.320 --> 03:50:02.720]  setting up police tape, setting up tents and tables in the front yard, going through every
[03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:09.160]  one of my personal possessions, seeking something, anything that could be used to embarrass me.
[03:50:09.160 --> 03:50:13.120]  It's a travesty that this can come happen in America.
[03:50:13.120 --> 03:50:14.960]  The question's obvious.
[03:50:14.960 --> 03:50:22.120]  When will Bill and Hillary Clinton's home in Chappaqua be raided by 29 FBI agents?
[03:50:22.120 --> 03:50:27.920]  When will John Brennan be taken into custody for his lies before the Congress?
[03:50:27.920 --> 03:50:34.880]  Why can James Comey tell the Congress that he didn't leak classified information or confidential
[03:50:34.880 --> 03:50:38.600]  information to the New York Times when he did?
[03:50:38.600 --> 03:50:45.880]  How is it that James Clapper tells the Congress under oath that there is no metadata collection
[03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:54.640]  program on Americans, disproved by the Intercept and Glenn Greenwald reporting on Edward Snowden,
[03:50:54.640 --> 03:51:04.400]  a bald-faced, treasonous lie, yet today Mr. Clapper is teaching ethics at Vermont College
[03:51:04.400 --> 03:51:09.520]  and working as a paid analyst for CNN.
[03:51:09.520 --> 03:51:16.240]  And then there's the question of why a CNN camera was 15 feet from my doorway and allowed
[03:51:16.240 --> 03:51:23.320]  to record the FBI agents in full SWAT gear with their night vision goggles and their
[03:51:23.320 --> 03:51:26.080]  assault weapons swarming my home.
[03:51:26.080 --> 03:51:33.600]  The street was sealed off to all traffic, all traffic that is other than CNN.
[03:51:33.600 --> 03:51:41.760]  And we now know that Josh Campbell, the producer on site directing the CNN camera team, is
[03:51:41.760 --> 03:51:50.040]  a former assistant to FBI Director James Comey and a longtime FBI employee.
[03:51:50.040 --> 03:51:56.480]  Yet CNN expects us to believe their claim that they were just operating on the basis
[03:51:56.480 --> 03:51:58.360]  of a tip.
[03:51:58.360 --> 03:51:59.680]  Not credible.
[03:51:59.680 --> 03:52:05.000]  At least one Republican congressman has asked for an investigation because the disclosure
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:11.280]  of a search warrant in advance of the search warrant being executed is a crime.
[03:52:11.280 --> 03:52:14.400]  But you see, they wanted to poison the jury pool.
[03:52:14.400 --> 03:52:18.000]  They want to make me public enemy number one.
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:22.720]  They want me to look like a drug kingpin or some kind of criminal to make sure that a
[03:52:22.720 --> 03:52:29.440]  jury gets the idea, even though I am accused of a series of nonviolent process crimes to
[03:52:29.440 --> 03:52:32.360]  which I plead not guilty.
[03:52:32.360 --> 03:52:41.800]  Now when I was arrested at 5.55 in the morning, essentially, I came to the door wearing my
[03:52:41.800 --> 03:52:51.240]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong t-shirt and a pair of blue cut off sweat gym pants bare
[03:52:51.240 --> 03:52:52.680]  footed.
[03:52:52.680 --> 03:53:02.000]  You can buy this t-shirt at 1776 dot shop, that's 1776 dot shop with the proceeds going
[03:53:02.000 --> 03:53:04.400]  to my legal defense fund.
[03:53:04.400 --> 03:53:10.280]  And I'm gratified for those of you who do go there and purchase a t-shirt, many have.
[03:53:10.280 --> 03:53:12.240]  I'm fighting for my life.
[03:53:12.240 --> 03:53:14.480]  My life is in your hands.
[03:53:14.480 --> 03:53:19.760]  You can read online that I'm worth 20, 10, 15 million dollars.
[03:53:19.760 --> 03:53:21.320]  It's a lie.
[03:53:21.320 --> 03:53:23.360]  I am virtually penniless.
[03:53:23.360 --> 03:53:27.040]  I am held together by the support of info wars.
[03:53:27.040 --> 03:53:32.680]  I am held together by the generous contributions of those who are paying for my legal defense
[03:53:32.680 --> 03:53:39.080]  fund and now must pay for some security so I can get to trial without being killed.
[03:53:39.080 --> 03:53:40.440]  That's where we are.
[03:53:40.440 --> 03:53:45.880]  I don't want to be Jack rubied somewhere in the streets of DC.
[03:53:45.880 --> 03:53:50.400]  I particularly want to thank all of those who have contacted me and told me that they
[03:53:50.400 --> 03:53:58.240]  are praying for me because prayer has power and our God has power and I am protected by
[03:53:58.240 --> 03:54:00.680]  my belief in God.
[03:54:00.680 --> 03:54:05.960]  I was given a Saint Michael's medal by a very dear friend at Christmas who told me
[03:54:05.960 --> 03:54:12.440]  to wear this for my protection and to pray every day to Saint Michael and I do.
[03:54:12.440 --> 03:54:18.480]  The FBI stripped me of that medal when I was arrested as I was also unallowed to wear a
[03:54:18.480 --> 03:54:25.720]  belt or any shoes with shoelaces but I am not suicidal because suicide is against God's
[03:54:25.720 --> 03:54:29.160]  law and I will fight for my life.
[03:54:29.160 --> 03:54:35.280]  I will fight for the truth and I know that Alex Jones is in my corner and info wars
[03:54:35.280 --> 03:54:41.320]  is in my corner but you cannot let them shut info wars down.
[03:54:41.320 --> 03:54:47.880]  Info wars is a vital piece of my strategic plan to fight back and there's nothing more
[03:54:47.880 --> 03:54:55.680]  than the Oliver Darcies and the Jacob Jared Holtz and the other dweebs who hate the First
[03:54:55.680 --> 03:55:01.620]  Amendment, hate free expression, hate the free press, hate the Constitution would like
[03:55:01.620 --> 03:55:03.120]  to do.
[03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:07.160]  So there's two things I ask at the end of this epic broadcast.
[03:55:07.160 --> 03:55:12.320]  Please go to the info wars dot com store now and send a generous contribution or buy one
