[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:32.280]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome to another worldwide
[00:32.280 --> 00:39.680]  transmission it is Thursday the 24th day of May 2012 we're about to be halfway in
[00:39.680 --> 00:47.880]  to the vaunted 2012 well Bilderberg 2012 is going to be big you've got articles in
[00:47.880 --> 00:54.440]  Washington Post multiple articles in Salon articles in Politico admitting
[00:54.440 --> 00:58.480]  that well these are some people that steer a lot of planetary affairs but
[00:58.480 --> 01:04.240]  you're still bad if you don't like them sure you conspiracy theorists that is
[01:04.240 --> 01:09.480]  people that are informed we're actually right and that's why you're bad well
[01:09.480 --> 01:13.320]  everybody sees through it everybody has enough of a memory to remember the
[01:13.320 --> 01:18.440]  media for decades saying Bilderberg doesn't exist I remember Rush Limbaugh
[01:18.440 --> 01:25.480]  20 years ago saying the council on foreign relations did not exist now in
[01:25.480 --> 01:30.240]  the last decade or so he just says they don't have any power and this is the
[01:30.240 --> 01:35.520]  type of stuff we deal with the CFR puts out bimonthly reports called foreign
[01:35.520 --> 01:42.320]  affairs it's at the bookstore calling for global government calling for geo
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.160]  engineering and controlling the weather calling for restricting free speech
[01:46.160 --> 01:51.920]  calling for selling the US out to China for globalism and there's always good
[01:51.920 --> 01:58.600]  reasons quote it's always spin but it's there and so those of us that actually
[01:58.600 --> 02:02.600]  did the research and knew what we're talking about we have credibility and
[02:02.600 --> 02:07.440]  those of you in the dinosaur media are forced to tag along and now go oh there
[02:07.440 --> 02:11.600]  is Bilderberg yeah Obama secretly met there four years ago we didn't tell you
[02:11.600 --> 02:18.520]  about that but now we are look they just went to the main page of the council on
[02:18.520 --> 02:24.860]  foreign relations and what's on it today the guys just went there what is it
[02:24.860 --> 02:33.200]  cfr.org I forget their exact URL what's the exact URL they're looking that up
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.560]  that's right CFR org oh look on the front page global governance click on
[02:37.560 --> 02:43.760]  that big giant I mean I mean there's no global government but the first thing
[02:43.760 --> 02:47.680]  they have a giant black letters is global governance and I've had these
[02:47.680 --> 02:51.000]  people on like the head of the Kissinger group Rothkoff because he thought I was
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.400]  Alex S. Jones I can tell you how many times we've gotten big fish on the shows
[02:54.400 --> 02:58.600]  they think I'm Alex S. Jones who does a radio commentary or did in the past for
[02:58.600 --> 03:04.080]  NPR and you know New York Times guy and he gets on he goes oh you're that Alex
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.480]  Jones he and then I got on with Rothkoff during the break and he knew I was
[03:08.480 --> 03:12.040]  he goes okay I'll just finish the interview but I called him back later
[03:12.040 --> 03:15.440]  get him on his secretary said no not after last time but he goes well we don't
[03:15.440 --> 03:19.400]  want global government we want global governance of course governance means
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.960]  government and they play these mind games with the public so doesn't exist
[03:23.960 --> 03:30.320]  though you go to their website today and it says global governance unelected
[03:30.320 --> 03:37.280]  mega bankers who are totally ruthless running our lives speaking and running
[03:37.280 --> 03:43.040]  our lives the system is again through government contracts taxing us private
[03:43.040 --> 03:49.160]  corporations are destroying us they've taken over the government whether it's
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.680]  big pharma and big agra like Monsanto or whether it's the big defense contractors
[03:54.680 --> 03:59.240]  who get a lot of their parts made in China now bowlings move to China general
[03:59.240 --> 04:04.240]  motors moving to China everything moving there and China coming in and buying
[04:04.240 --> 04:09.600]  the biggest theater chain buying huge controlling positions in the big
[04:09.600 --> 04:14.440]  Hollywood production companies a year and a half ago they had to stop the
[04:14.440 --> 04:19.360]  release of the Red Dawn movie and go back and reshoot it so that it's North
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.560]  Koreans invading oh that's real believable they can't even get their
[04:23.560 --> 04:27.800]  cars to start because they're under such communism but the communist Chinese
[04:27.800 --> 04:34.040]  they said we don't want that movie to come out and so Hollywood said okay
[04:34.040 --> 04:38.560]  we'll redo the movie and now it's in limbo but I've got to look at the update
[04:38.560 --> 04:41.520]  on that and find out what the latest is I know watching the story on a few days

[08:56.520 --> 09:02.480]  now we can he's there with the cold case posse sent by sheriff Joe Arpaio and
[09:02.480 --> 09:06.240]  he's got some new breaking news here for us it'll be almost for about 30
[09:06.240 --> 09:11.280]  minutes at the start of the next hour and the rest of the broadcast will be
[09:11.280 --> 09:21.520]  open phones and news obviously CBS news is reporting that the new arms race
[09:21.520 --> 09:28.160]  worldwide is governments arming against their populations drones with hang grenade
[09:28.160 --> 09:37.600]  launchers gas launchers 12-gauge shotguns 30,000 of them to be deployed
[09:37.600 --> 09:42.160]  against the American people brigade homeland combat troops on the streets
[09:42.160 --> 09:47.960]  TSA as the first contact group that will then tell you you're detained and have an
[09:47.960 --> 09:51.600]  army truck pull up and get you re-education camps are built army
[09:51.600 --> 09:55.520]  admits those documents are authentic we have a complete criminal group and
[09:55.520 --> 10:00.880]  control and if the police and military and public follow the narrative that's
[10:00.880 --> 10:05.080]  going to be rolled out we're going to go into deepest tyranny controlled
[10:05.080 --> 10:10.160]  designed implosion and depression with the criminals that engineered it posing
[10:10.160 --> 10:17.600]  as saviors now this is actually reported on back in April but it got a lot of the
[10:17.600 --> 10:21.560]  news yesterday when drudge linked to CBS groups concerned over arming of
[10:21.560 --> 10:25.880]  domestic drones that headline actually got changed overnight the link that it
[10:25.880 --> 10:32.080]  it was police moved to arm drones and the very companies that they report on
[10:32.080 --> 10:39.200]  here are the ones that already have combat drones small ones with 12-gauge
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.360]  shotguns you can buy these this is a citizen 12-gauge shotguns on them I know
[10:44.360 --> 10:49.960]  because we're doing a report on drones and we're looking at drones and we don't
[10:49.960 --> 10:55.120]  have the budget to buy a $2,000 drone that has a mount for a 22 or 12 gauge but
[10:55.120 --> 10:58.280]  these the police departments already have these and we're talking about a
[10:58.280 --> 11:02.480]  couple thousand dollars for one of these bad boys 5,000 for a one-fifth scale
[11:02.480 --> 11:06.760]  helicopter you can put rocket launchers on you can put the rocket launchers on
[11:06.760 --> 11:12.480]  it you just can't put the warheads on it unless you're a police agency so the
[11:12.480 --> 11:18.760]  arms race is on and I remember all these years ago I warned you from MIT
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.400]  documents that were public Pentagon DARPA documents that were public that they
[11:22.400 --> 11:27.320]  said by 2012 they wanted half the Air Force to be drone it's 2012 more than
[11:27.320 --> 11:31.120]  half the Air Force is now drone last time I checked the Air Force is something
[11:31.120 --> 11:36.680]  like 10,000 predators another 8,000 ordered the Army has thousands of them
[11:36.680 --> 11:44.040]  the Marines have thousands of them thousands thousands I think what what
[11:44.040 --> 11:47.360]  the Army has a couple thousand the Marines have a couple thousand you think
[11:47.360 --> 11:51.840]  the Army would have more than the Marines the the Marines have got a bunch
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.960]  of these little helicopters that they call what the scout great helicopters
[11:57.960 --> 12:04.680]  with missile launchers on them and it's on and I did some searching last night
[12:04.680 --> 12:06.960]  I mean I'd already seen these articles over the last year but I did some
[12:06.960 --> 12:10.000]  searching and pull these articles back up police departments all over the
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.080]  country have bought combat drones I remember talking to a Marine Corps
[12:15.080 --> 12:19.800]  captain source who told me about the combat robots they had in 99 then I
[12:19.800 --> 12:23.280]  went to an urban warfare drill and was talking to some of them some of the
[12:23.280 --> 12:27.800]  officers the Colonel and others and when I brought up combat drones that were
[12:27.800 --> 12:32.520]  actually four legged and things they got very upset so you need to get out of
[12:32.520 --> 12:35.760]  here they were acting real friendly till I brought that up at the minute you
[12:35.760 --> 12:38.480]  bring up something classified like that because they know their whole career is
[12:38.480 --> 12:43.400]  over they even act like they're talking to you they freak out hey a secret
[12:43.400 --> 12:51.280]  armies of robots against the American people is not kosher okay and it's not
[12:51.280 --> 12:55.800]  gonna fly pun intended I noticed in a video I shot last night and uploaded
[12:55.800 --> 13:03.200]  about 10 dealing with the drones that's an info wars calm drones to attack the
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.440]  American people armed drones to attack the American people's the headline
[13:07.440 --> 13:13.080]  linking to the other articles in a boil down the Paul Watson did yesterday with
[13:13.080 --> 13:17.520]  links to the different stories I noticed people saying oh get the tinfoil
[13:17.520 --> 13:23.240]  how's out everybody this is salon drones for urban warfare manufacturers are
[13:23.240 --> 13:27.280]  targeting US police forces for sales as drones move from the Middle East to the
[13:27.280 --> 13:33.600]  Main Street okay here's CBS last night groups concerned over arming of
[13:33.600 --> 13:40.560]  domestic drones I mean right here in Texas they've got combat drones combat
[13:40.560 --> 13:45.880]  drones with shotguns and grenade launchers and they go on to say they
[13:45.880 --> 13:52.200]  want them to for crowd control with speakers and rubber bullets they always
[13:52.200 --> 13:55.440]  phase it in with a less lethal they call them non-lethal on the news but they're
[13:55.440 --> 13:59.480]  really called less lethal inside the industry to get you used to the image
[13:59.480 --> 14:03.480]  of drones firing on people and then next it's real weapons or the taser only
[14:03.480 --> 14:08.000]  kills you you know one out of 30 or 40 people so they up the power 30% or more
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.320]  now it kills even more people this is what's going on this is the real world
[14:13.320 --> 14:18.400]  and just saying tinfoil hat isn't gonna protect you oh we said they'd have a
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.000]  global government run by six megabanks those exact six megabanks I told you
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.600]  about over a decade ago are announcing global government as a solution to the
[14:26.600 --> 14:31.800]  derivatives crisis they created the reeducation camps are admitted everything
[14:31.800 --> 14:36.440]  is coming out in the open but so many of the population are preconditioned that
[14:36.440 --> 14:41.680]  they can't resist it via Stockholm syndrome mass collective Stockholm
[14:41.680 --> 14:49.760]  syndrome mass denial cognitive dissidents learned helplessness and the normalcy
[14:49.760 --> 14:54.480]  bias and this is why the Germans did what they did they were much more
[14:54.480 --> 14:58.880]  hard-working and moral and upright than I've looked at the sociology the
[14:58.880 --> 15:03.560]  history the anthropology the Germans of the 30s were so much more moral than
[15:03.560 --> 15:07.040]  Americans are today and make your head spin just like Americans of the 30s were
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.880]  much more moral America is gonna go so much worse than Nazi Germany or
[15:12.880 --> 15:16.600]  Soviet Russia if these globalists have their way I mean how many clips do I have
[15:16.600 --> 15:20.320]  to give you heard Lord Monk in here yesterday sourcing mainstream news saying
[15:20.320 --> 15:24.600]  arrest and kill those of us that don't believe in man-made global warming and
[15:24.600 --> 15:28.520]  don't want to pay Al Gore and Barack Obama money to their climate exchange
[15:28.520 --> 15:35.840]  they say kill us kill us I can play you the informant who was with the highest
[15:35.840 --> 15:39.960]  levels of the weatherman this later came out in court and heirs had to admit it
[15:39.960 --> 15:45.560]  where they plan to put 50 plus million in camps and kill half of us 25 mil
[15:45.560 --> 15:50.000]  you're and again your normalcy bias won't let you deal with that we have
[15:50.000 --> 15:55.040]  sickening scum who don't care about having a happy safe good country they
[15:55.040 --> 16:02.640]  want power they want to dominate it's a will to power and if we don't get really
[16:02.640 --> 16:06.000]  aggressive with these globalists they're going to stage terror attacks and
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.640]  they're going to shut down the internet as we know it and they're gonna come and
[16:08.640 --> 16:12.680]  arrest Alex Jones and they're going to come and they're going to arrest even
[16:12.680 --> 16:15.440]  people who think they can work with a system like Glenn Beck and Rupert Murdoch
[16:15.440 --> 16:17.960]  you're all going to jail and they're getting that ready I told you that was
[16:17.960 --> 16:21.720]  coming years ago when they start going after news core you know they're going
[16:21.720 --> 16:27.200]  after everybody else because it's seen in the power structure as an enemy not
[16:27.200 --> 16:30.600]  that it isn't even part of the power structure but the power structure will
[16:30.600 --> 16:36.120]  start eating its own and when you see the globalist eating their own and power
[16:36.120 --> 16:40.760]  struggles at the very top that means they're going into the hot face and it's
[16:40.760 --> 16:45.200]  going to result in civil war in this country it's going to result in dead
[16:45.200 --> 16:50.560]  cops piled up to the sky and dead citizens and I'm telling you I'm telling
[16:50.560 --> 16:54.160]  you you better get over your normalcy bias and your learned helplessness and
[16:54.160 --> 16:59.640]  your mass Stockholm syndrome right now the system wants to give everybody these
[16:59.640 --> 17:06.160]  toys as a psychological warfare device to scare everyone and to have forward
[17:06.160 --> 17:12.240]  observers armed drones so that people feel like resistance is futile well
[17:12.240 --> 17:16.280]  everybody has showed in psychology aerial bombardment actually unifies
[17:16.280 --> 17:22.800]  populations but this is a tinker toy so the police can go under federal
[17:22.800 --> 17:27.040]  control they have to do that to have these drones and feel like you know
[17:27.040 --> 17:30.840]  they're playing a video game when they're killing citizens it's to remove
[17:30.840 --> 17:38.440]  the humanity from it and here's the rest of the story by 2020 they intend to
[17:38.440 --> 17:46.520]  have the entire combat force of ground troops and forces in the air the entire
[17:46.520 --> 17:52.320]  force will be robots they intend to have the entire force that's why they're
[17:52.320 --> 17:55.040]  getting ready to put women in front line combat and all this because that's all
[17:55.040 --> 17:58.320]  gone there's not going to be humans going to space there's not going to be
[17:58.320 --> 18:03.080]  humans fighting or flying jets anymore it's not going to even be zip faced
[18:03.080 --> 18:06.720]  Weldon Henson who got out of the Air Force five years ago and works here
[18:06.720 --> 18:11.760]  worked on F-16s he's brought in his photos him and his buddies pretty
[18:11.760 --> 18:16.080]  interesting stuff and he said almost everyone he knows is still in the Air
[18:16.080 --> 18:21.840]  Force is like basically laughing at the regular pilots now because the people
[18:21.840 --> 18:27.160]  that were loading bombs on F-16s and all this and working on their engines
[18:27.160 --> 18:33.400]  they are all training to fly the drones but see that's already over the LA
[18:33.400 --> 18:37.920]  Times reported months ago they're coming out with the autonomous drones they
[18:37.920 --> 18:42.640]  already have autonomous drones autonomous helicopters everything where they go
[18:42.640 --> 18:47.240]  out with a pre-program mission and kind of in an autonomous way kill and again
[18:47.240 --> 18:50.960]  the globalist don't care of the military says no and stands down because
[18:50.960 --> 18:56.280]  they're already building factories with robots that work on the robots and all
[18:56.280 --> 19:01.240]  they have to have is technocrats that sit there and do fine-tuning and things
[19:01.240 --> 19:06.600]  okay this is the new world order revolution so all you cops and you know
[19:06.600 --> 19:10.920]  all of you that are tough guys out there and you're in a war and you're gonna win
[19:10.920 --> 19:14.960]  and you've got all these toys and you like killing people and it's a video game
[19:14.960 --> 19:20.400]  for you you've already been implanted with cancer viruses you've already been
[19:20.400 --> 19:24.320]  implanted with deadly radioactive isotopes and fluoride and other deadly
[19:24.320 --> 19:30.560]  chemicals this is all ready happened this is all ready unfolding this is all
[19:30.560 --> 19:35.520]  ready going on and again you're gonna laugh now down the road you're gonna
[19:35.520 --> 19:40.360]  remember what I told you even when my voice is erased off the internet they
[19:40.360 --> 19:43.840]  already have those programs they can go through in a matter of hours and block my
[19:43.840 --> 19:47.080]  voice worldwide or move it off everything so you better be taking these
[19:47.080 --> 19:51.160]  videos and storing them in old media formats you better be getting small
[19:51.160 --> 19:55.520]  copying machines and low-tech systems to get the word out you better get ready
[19:55.520 --> 19:59.480]  for the resistance because here's the deal they're gonna come and kill over

[24:03.680 --> 24:12.360]  ladies and gentlemen during the break I was in the coffee room the break room
[24:12.360 --> 24:17.120]  getting a coffee I was gonna get a tangy tantrum but I didn't have time to stir
[24:17.120 --> 24:20.120]  it up so I thought well I'll have a little half cup of coffee that's all that
[24:20.120 --> 24:26.720]  was sitting in one of the coffee makers side issue as I like to say segue away
[24:26.720 --> 24:35.720]  from that and guess what I saw on the television it was a Cisco ad and guys
[24:35.720 --> 24:41.240]  you could probably pull this up on YouTube I'm sure Cisco has its TV ads on
[24:41.240 --> 24:48.000]  a YouTube official page I bet money on it and it was Cisco innovative solutions
[24:48.000 --> 24:54.320]  assembly lines that fix themselves robots that work on the robots and they
[24:54.320 --> 24:58.000]  were bragging that they don't even have technicians to fix the robots that fix
[24:58.000 --> 25:04.440]  the robots totally automated again exactly what I was just saying did you
[25:04.440 --> 25:09.160]  ever think where the humans gonna be involved in all of this you're like
[25:09.160 --> 25:15.200]  well that's just innovation that's just evolution exactly that's what the
[25:15.200 --> 25:19.520]  globalists say that's what recurs well it's what all of them say the UN says
[25:19.520 --> 25:25.640]  it's a post human planet there it is Cisco robot that's the ad I was just
[25:25.640 --> 25:32.360]  watching amazing we'll come back from break then and that looks like the same
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.400]  ad yeah this is it and they say oh don't worry robots fix the robots turn it up
[25:36.400 --> 25:42.680]  turn it up turn it up assembly lines that fix themselves the most innovative
[25:42.680 --> 25:46.480]  companies are doing things they never could before by building on the Cisco
[25:46.480 --> 25:51.440]  intelligent network so that's just what I just saw out there and that's the
[25:51.440 --> 25:55.760]  double edge of technology I can see something literally a minute and a half
[25:55.760 --> 26:00.360]  ago come in here and mention it the human computers in there that can
[26:00.360 --> 26:05.800]  recognize beauty and love their children you know the dominant species on this
[26:05.800 --> 26:09.760]  planet they were able to then interface with the computer and bring that up in
[26:09.760 --> 26:14.160]  seconds but the globalists just say oh we've taken control of human development
[26:14.160 --> 26:18.560]  evolution if you want to use that term and we've decided that the elite are
[26:18.560 --> 26:21.240]  gonna merge with computers and live forever and we're gonna kill the rest
[26:21.240 --> 26:26.080]  of you and wired magazine you know as I talk about 12 years ago why the future
[26:26.080 --> 26:29.480]  doesn't need us bill joy he said yeah I met with a bit a big meeting of the
[26:29.480 --> 26:33.000]  richest people in the world 200 of them and we decided that we're just gonna
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  kill everybody and that's the debate he said was happening and he said the
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.680]  public really doesn't care so things are leaning towards just killing everyone
[26:41.680 --> 26:48.160]  we've decided that'll be better for the earth that's just the co-founder and
[26:48.160 --> 26:54.720]  owner of some micro systems and of course out of that you have the head of Cisco
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.520]  he was part of that and I'll never forget in the year 2000 they had him on
[26:59.520 --> 27:04.480]  Lair News Hour it was McNeil Lair still in 2000 they said what do you look
[27:04.480 --> 27:08.800]  forward to most in the new millennium and he said microchips in everyone
[27:08.800 --> 27:12.120]  tracking you wherever you go my son will have a chip and everything about him
[27:12.120 --> 27:14.760]  will be known we'll have a virtual reality where everything is tracked by
[27:14.760 --> 27:20.960]  microchips RFID sort of laughing demonically and then I get on here and
[27:20.960 --> 27:24.840]  I say hey I just saw him say this and they're like oh shut up cook everything's
[27:24.840 --> 27:29.760]  fine and so they're just telling us this is the new system they phase it in
[27:29.760 --> 27:35.600]  condition everybody have you scramble and fight to get the latest product you
[27:35.600 --> 27:41.760]  pay for the washer the dryer the the computer the iPhone there's BBC saying
[27:41.760 --> 27:45.320]  barcode every one at birth everyone needs a microchip see it's all just in
[27:45.320 --> 27:48.400]  your face now oh we're never gonna do that now yeah you bet we're gonna make
[27:48.400 --> 27:52.560]  you and the troops are gonna have chips too and you pay for it when you go buy
[27:52.560 --> 27:56.960]  an iPhone around 30 to 40 percent from the different analysts I've talked to
[27:56.960 --> 28:00.640]  the cost and then the fact it doesn't work as well as it would is all the
[28:00.640 --> 28:06.520]  backdoors and tech spying on you under federal law they have to be able to
[28:06.520 --> 28:11.320]  dial into this even when it's turned off and it looks like it's off but I can
[28:11.320 --> 28:13.280]  always tell when they're doing that because I'll turn it on the batteries
[28:13.280 --> 28:17.880]  completely down it'll also get hot when they access those systems I mean I've
[28:17.880 --> 28:21.320]  seen it before last time I was at Bilderberg the power would just race down
[28:21.320 --> 28:26.640]  on it I can never keep it charged the phone I had then and everybody's phone
[28:26.640 --> 28:30.960]  was doing it and then and then they called up and told my wife they'd been
[28:30.960 --> 28:33.480]  listening to the conversation minutes before and you know said threatening
[28:33.480 --> 28:37.440]  things to her so it's not just oh look my things running out of batteries you
[28:37.440 --> 28:42.000]  know triple fast they're listening even when it's turned off oh no no they want
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.120]  me to know yeah we're listening and we you know we hope your dad dies in the
[28:47.120 --> 28:51.960]  hospital that was to her about her dad and I was at her mom they were both sick
[28:51.960 --> 28:55.640]  at the time and you know we're gonna we hope you die and then another call back

[29:14.640 --> 29:20.440]  care about you the new order hates you they hate the troops tall oh have more
[29:20.440 --> 29:24.120]  wars it's for the troops that's why 12 years ago they started taking their

[29:39.160 --> 29:43.760]  think they're God I think they're gonna merge with computers are in charge we're

[32:19.840 --> 32:24.560]  together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[32:24.560 --> 32:29.160]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your
[32:29.160 --> 32:32.800]  family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified
[32:32.800 --> 32:36.960]  in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis
[32:36.960 --> 32:42.080]  garden so visit them today at survival seed bank com that's survival seed bank
[32:42.080 --> 32:53.080]  com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real
[32:53.080 --> 32:57.760]  crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for
[32:57.760 --> 33:06.680]  survival seed bank com you could accept the fact that the city is headed for a
[33:06.680 --> 33:10.800]  disaster of biblical proportion what do you mean biblical what do you mean this
[33:10.800 --> 33:15.840]  old testament yes mayor real wrath of God type stock fire and brimstone coming
[33:15.840 --> 33:19.080]  down from the skies rivers and seas boiling 40 years of darkness
[33:19.080 --> 33:23.520]  earthquakes volcanoes the dead rising from the grave human sacrifice dogs and
[33:23.520 --> 33:24.840]  cats living together
[33:24.840 --> 33:38.040]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[33:38.040 --> 33:41.840]  tyranny over the mind of man thomas jefferson live from austin texas
[33:41.840 --> 33:55.640]  podcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones I wish we could sit here and joke around
[33:55.640 --> 33:58.680]  about the calamity the degeneration of society that we're in the globalists
[33:58.680 --> 34:06.920]  understand that humans tend to model through things and so what they do is
[34:06.920 --> 34:12.920]  they just phase them in slowly until incredibly horrible things are happening
[34:12.920 --> 34:18.680]  and people are just accustomed to it diabetes up over 2,000% cancer on
[34:18.680 --> 34:24.640]  average up over 2,000% diabetes up closer to 3,000% type 2 in the last 50
[34:24.640 --> 34:30.360]  years neurological disorders up several thousand percent diseases and problems
[34:30.360 --> 34:39.240]  with the bones up massively we are being absolutely slaughtered and we just go
[34:39.240 --> 34:44.120]  along with the system because it's peer pressure we're taught from birth that's
[34:44.120 --> 34:51.320]  all that matters in a free society being free and standing up for what you
[34:51.320 --> 34:55.120]  believe in is what matters and what is honorable but not in this system it's all
[34:55.120 --> 35:00.080]  about the surface and that's why people are so hollow and in surveys say
[35:00.080 --> 35:07.120]  they're so unhappy because no amount of worldliness is going to fulfill you that
[35:07.120 --> 35:10.560]  mean you should all run off the desert or sackcloth no and the hierarchy of
[35:10.560 --> 35:16.320]  needs it's important to be financially secured to have good transportation all
[35:16.320 --> 35:21.640]  of that but you wouldn't sell out for that that isn't what's at the top of
[35:21.640 --> 35:27.840]  your hierarchy of needs on the top of your pyramid the human destiny a sense
[35:27.840 --> 35:33.280]  of pride in humanity a sense of wanting to build up the species that
[35:33.280 --> 35:40.320]  civilization a sense of wanting a fair shake a instinctive drive to seek out
[35:40.320 --> 35:46.400]  corrupt evil people and run them out of town that's what build societies instead
[35:46.400 --> 35:50.040]  we've got the crooks in control and they're seeking to persecute goodness
[35:50.040 --> 35:58.320]  and goodliness and run it out of town all over the country your taxpayer money
[35:58.320 --> 36:04.280]  is being used in even small departments to buy weaponized drones giant armored
[36:04.280 --> 36:08.760]  vehicles heavy armored vehicles we're talking about vehicles with six inch
[36:08.760 --> 36:14.680]  plate for combat against the American people and the training manuals they
[36:14.680 --> 36:18.680]  got them primed on fighting jihadis they're flipping and as I told you would
[36:18.680 --> 36:23.920]  to good old boys of course if it does go to civil war people aren't going to come
[36:23.920 --> 36:30.320]  out and look for you when you're in your tank folks are going to come and look
[36:30.320 --> 36:35.760]  for you when you're at the bar of the restaurant as you abuse and kill more
[36:35.760 --> 36:40.520]  people and no amount of drones are going to protect you but again that's all a
[36:40.520 --> 36:51.840]  fraud to begin with because you are under attack you are obsolete the globalist
[36:51.840 --> 36:57.440]  in all of their public publications say by 2020 there will not be combat forces
[36:57.440 --> 37:02.080]  there will be paramilitary groups that they keep as a vestigial holdback in
[37:02.080 --> 37:10.080]  very small numbers per city to go after the American people but you're going to
[37:10.080 --> 37:16.120]  see police actually start going away from weapons in the next phase and it's
[37:16.120 --> 37:20.200]  all going to be automated robots automated drones on the ground and in the
[37:20.200 --> 37:26.960]  air they send after you this is the nanny state that's going to put in a
[37:26.960 --> 37:30.480]  technocracy in their words what are the globalists call themselves they say
[37:30.480 --> 37:35.120]  yes we are technocrats which is a technological dictatorship financial
[37:35.120 --> 37:40.760]  times economist wall street journal hundreds of publications they say we
[37:40.760 --> 37:46.000]  are the technocrats aren't you lucky that we're taking your rights away they
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.520]  actually are saying it publicly and saying yeah we need to arrest people
[37:51.520 --> 37:54.840]  that don't want a global carbon tax paid to the central banks yeah we need to
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.520]  we need to start shutting down talk radio yeah we need to we need to start
[37:59.520 --> 38:03.760]  you know curtailing the web and if we say you violated copyright three times
[38:03.760 --> 38:07.200]  no judge no jury you're banned from the web with internet ID now being proposed
[38:07.200 --> 38:13.920]  by bilterberg group publicly proposed by one of their top ministers in the EU for
[38:13.920 --> 38:17.920]  worldwide starting in the euro and even drugs picked that up yesterday because
[38:17.920 --> 38:22.640]  it's a public statement this is all here the power to track is the power to
[38:22.640 --> 38:28.920]  tax and destroy let this be a testament that you are warned the toll free
[38:28.920 --> 38:36.360]  number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 so oh they'll never be
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.360]  drones even though they were flying around 10 years ago predators now
[38:39.360 --> 38:43.920]  rapers going after quote cattle wrestlers the cattle had gone on to the
[38:43.920 --> 38:48.400]  North Dakota property more than 10 times under law the people said that's it your
[38:48.400 --> 38:52.240]  cows keep getting in with our cows we're keeping them that's standard
[38:52.240 --> 39:00.120]  procedure they sent in Air Force drone because the people owned guns and the
[39:00.120 --> 39:06.240]  local SWAT team coordinated with the drone to wait till the time that the
[39:06.240 --> 39:09.800]  farming family was not quote having guns in their hands and we're out on the
[39:09.800 --> 39:20.000]  tractors this is agenda 21 this is the shutdown of society now in Minnesota and
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.600]  California they're doing door-to-door with list of customers that have bought
[39:23.600 --> 39:27.880]  raw milk and without warrants busting in and taking the milk and you're like
[39:27.880 --> 39:31.800]  well that's absurd tyranny is meant to be absurd they asked Lenin in public
[39:31.800 --> 39:35.440]  communiques that were released about a decade ago out of the old Soviet
[39:35.440 --> 39:39.600]  archives you know even the New York Times reported on these they would say to
[39:39.600 --> 39:42.920]  Lenin all right we've already rounded up in these areas half the people we've
[39:42.920 --> 39:46.080]  killed a large percentage the others are in slave camps everyone else is
[39:46.080 --> 39:52.480]  totally submitting he just said kill more I want terror I want fear quote I
[39:52.480 --> 40:05.120]  want more blood and that's the red star symbolizes blood and all the Trotskyites
[40:05.120 --> 40:08.320]  that got kicked out by Stalin double-crossed by him they all went to
[40:08.320 --> 40:14.480]  Mexico in the US and they were the neocons they bragged that they're
[40:14.480 --> 40:19.800]  Trotskyites and but they call themselves conservatives and they built up a giant
[40:19.800 --> 40:24.440]  military against us but that's now Obama runs that and and they all work in
[40:24.440 --> 40:29.920]  concert together and now they're going to phase that out and it's the new drone
[40:29.920 --> 40:34.800]  army and and this is it and I would talk about this over the last decade because
[40:34.800 --> 40:42.760]  it's in MIT magazine brags about it I remember again five six years ago my
[40:42.760 --> 40:49.840]  wife wanted a salad and so I went up to the Cypress Grill off William Cannon and
[40:49.840 --> 40:56.440]  I went in there and sat at the bar ordered a beer while I was waiting for
[40:56.440 --> 41:01.520]  the food and they had a stack of MIT magazine I guess somebody that worked
[41:01.520 --> 41:05.120]  there or something had been to MIT that was just or the owner I don't know I'm
[41:05.120 --> 41:09.360]  guessing it was a magazine rack full of MIT magazine I picked one up and it was
[41:09.360 --> 41:12.920]  the entire program in Iraq is a laboratory for the United States
[41:12.920 --> 41:17.520]  Disneyland is a Pentagon warfare laboratory of locking down US cities
[41:17.520 --> 41:22.840]  it's so wonderful I go home search it find all that stuff just in your face
[41:22.840 --> 41:26.840]  and these geeks get off on the power of it and the guys in the military do I
[41:26.840 --> 41:32.440]  mean do you see what you're building oh you're good guys I forgot this is all
[41:32.440 --> 41:39.240]  for our own safety I was at a birthday party for one of my daughter's birthday
[41:39.240 --> 41:43.640]  last weekend there was a lawyer there I'm sitting there talking to him and
[41:43.640 --> 41:47.800]  people are talking about Disneyland and having to hand scan to get in I said
[41:47.800 --> 41:51.000]  yeah it's Pentagon laboratory and people were looking at me so I got my phone out
[41:51.000 --> 41:55.960]  and was searching and showed them since 1996 it's been a Pentagon laboratory see
[41:55.960 --> 41:59.680]  it there's mice and then happy animals and goofy and everything you go in
[41:59.680 --> 42:03.600]  everything's fun and they're RFID scanning you with a bracelet they're
[42:03.600 --> 42:06.480]  hand scanning you face scanning cameras are watching you the entire time
[42:06.480 --> 42:11.800]  tracking you it's a model of a lock down city like G20 or any of this this is
[42:11.800 --> 42:16.160]  the new America this is the new world and it's a tech grid that's growing like
[42:16.160 --> 42:23.120]  tentacles into everything RFID like there's articles today what in what is
[42:23.120 --> 42:27.360]  it associated press here's a boil down out of it out of the week bars using app
[42:27.360 --> 42:35.640]  and hidden cameras to scan customers faces Max Cabrera during South by Southwest
[42:35.640 --> 42:38.640]  went out to a demonstration of this we never even got the report number we
[42:38.640 --> 42:41.800]  don't have enough staff we're so busy we can't even get the time to interview and
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.400]  hire the next step but we're trying that reports out there with the company
[42:45.400 --> 42:48.640]  actually where you go in the bar and it facecans everybody and of course puts it
[42:48.640 --> 42:58.360]  in the database I remember 10 12 years ago getting a tour of the UT psychology
[42:58.360 --> 43:02.480]  department the unclassified areas I might have accidentally seen some of the
[43:02.480 --> 43:12.880]  classified oopsie but it was all retina scanners hidden in the grocery store to
[43:12.880 --> 43:18.920]  track you and then test you and then track your psychological profile biometric
[43:18.920 --> 43:22.720]  movement systems I mean basically you've paid for a bunch of eugenics mad
[43:22.720 --> 43:27.920]  scientists to build a giant supermax prison and to poison the living
[43:27.920 --> 43:31.840]  daylights out of you and your family and publish it in countless Rockefeller
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.120]  Foundation documents that we linked to at info wars.com on a daily basis now we
[43:36.120 --> 43:41.560]  find new horrific ones worldwide the UN goes into countries in some cases 46,000
[43:41.560 --> 43:46.240]  in India alone paralyzes children with them with the polio shot then it
[43:46.240 --> 43:50.080]  spreads polio and they said we've got a polio vaccinate everybody because polio
[43:50.080 --> 43:53.280]  spreading then it spreads faster and they and they and they're just
[43:53.280 --> 43:57.760]  devastating and killing and paralyzing people in hellish attacks Bellarmine
[43:57.760 --> 44:01.840]  the gauge riding that white horse something fierce and the normal C
[44:01.840 --> 44:06.200]  bias learned helplessness Stockholm syndrome people go I'm gonna choose to
[44:06.200 --> 44:11.540]  not believe this it's too scary I'm gonna cuddle up and grovel to the system
[44:11.540 --> 44:16.640]  and worship tyranny as if that's gonna save you and then you get the word your
[44:16.640 --> 44:21.400]  10-year-old's got Crohn's disease from the GMO or you get the word your 32-year-old

[44:30.880 --> 44:36.760]  involved in politics well you're dead you're dead then you're dead everything's
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.000]  gonna start moving really quick okay they're gonna start having drones kill
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  people it's gonna be a test case it'll be bank robbers child kidnappers it's
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.320]  like oh they killed a bank robber with a drone yeah Pentagon came in and lit
[44:49.320 --> 44:55.640]  them up oh whatever you know they got the bad guy precedent set what did I
[44:55.640 --> 44:58.360]  tell you more than 10 years ago we don't dig up those rants where I describe you

[45:12.080 --> 45:15.080]  the back and a drone it launches off the roof these are the real designs by
[45:15.080 --> 45:19.040]  Pentagon sources told me about 12 years ago imagine how advanced they are its
[45:19.040 --> 45:23.720]  ETA is two minutes you get on the road they've got automatic kill switches and
[45:23.720 --> 45:27.720]  all the new cars let's say got an old car they've already fit they've already
[45:27.720 --> 45:32.880]  scanned the license plate they already know they've got drones in the sky that
[45:32.880 --> 45:37.680]  know your heat resonance off the top your head and shoulders 45 seconds after
[45:37.680 --> 45:42.320]  leaving a drone comes in and fires a pulse weapon which they already have
[45:42.320 --> 45:48.680]  that turns your car off you get out in the future they won't even tell you to
[45:48.680 --> 45:56.040]  stop over the loudspeaker they fire a rocket propelled 50 caliber bullet that
[45:56.040 --> 46:00.240]  has rudders on it and can actually change direction and you run and jump in
[46:00.240 --> 46:05.920]  a culvert it goes in and kills you all these video game addicts who are like
[46:05.920 --> 46:09.880]  14 years old they're gonna be just standby technicians watching and

[46:36.520 --> 46:39.560]  on the statesman two weeks ago that you have a better chance of getting higher
[46:39.560 --> 46:43.680]  and paid up more money that guys I meant to print this look it up people
[46:43.680 --> 46:47.040]  getting more jobs after ACC than UT it's actually a pretty good community
[46:47.040 --> 46:52.200]  college system it's pretty honed I mean actually give you type curricula that
[46:52.200 --> 46:57.560]  people are looking for computer you know all that stuff working on computers you
[46:57.560 --> 47:06.960]  name it but they have had a 15% are not signing back up in its entire 20 plus
[47:06.960 --> 47:10.600]  year history this is 30 plus year history it's the first time Austin
[47:10.600 --> 47:20.000]  Community College is imploding 500 classes are going to be canceled 500 in
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.560]  the summer and then they're looking at even more in the fall they're
[47:25.560 --> 47:31.640]  projecting upwards of a thousand classes next fall total collapse breaking
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.880]  revolt against vaccines leads to mass exodus from Texas colleges starting in
[47:36.880 --> 47:41.680]  Texas colleges under state edict not law remember Perry said it was a lawyer to
[47:41.680 --> 47:46.040]  take artisanals girls died but it kicked in government liability
[47:46.040 --> 47:50.040]  protection for a product and they were killing people let me just read the
[47:50.040 --> 47:55.400]  article this is big news see we revolt now by saying no or it's all over
[47:55.400 --> 47:59.960]  we start stopping this recognizing it collectively our human instinct for
[47:59.960 --> 48:05.640]  survival it either kicks in or we're dead you either fight back or it's over
[48:05.640 --> 48:12.960]  this is a technological scientifically planned total takeover grid you either
[48:12.960 --> 48:21.160]  have the hepatitis you either have the other vaccines the meningitis vaccines
[48:21.160 --> 48:24.360]  or you don't go but they have a couple cases each year mainly foreigners
[48:24.360 --> 48:29.080]  coming in better chance of slipping dying you know in the in the shower they

[48:42.960 --> 48:47.800]  breaking here they don't want this out because the administrators just want to
[48:47.800 --> 48:50.520]  have a big successful college you're saying hey let's tell them there's a
[48:50.520 --> 48:56.320]  waiver they go no you tell them it's the law or you're fired see they're also

[49:06.360 --> 49:11.880]  these are enemies of America they are their enemies they all follow
[49:11.880 --> 49:16.080]  centralized orders this is the enemy this is the death of America this is
[49:16.080 --> 49:23.240]  cancer info wars has talked to a senior but we were contacted and received
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.800]  information we didn't just talk to him I want Paul to add that you understand
[49:27.800 --> 49:30.920]  this is a whistleblower you get me Paul on the liner in the brick and a talk to
[49:30.920 --> 49:36.240]  him info wars has received information from a senior whistleblower who is a
[49:36.240 --> 49:40.800]  senior administrator with Austin Community College who has divulged that
[49:40.800 --> 49:44.880]  enrollment numbers are collapsing due to students refusing to comply with
[49:44.880 --> 49:51.160]  vaccinations they are told are mandatory in order to take classes the ACC
[49:51.160 --> 49:54.760]  administrator told Alex Jones that some 10,000 students have refused to enroll
[49:54.760 --> 49:59.400]  or they've gotten out because of their refusal to take inoculations although
[49:59.400 --> 50:02.960]  waivers for religious and personal objections are available the ACC source
[50:02.960 --> 50:06.040]  said students were being given the impression that the inoculations were
[50:06.040 --> 50:11.600]  compulsory indeed college authorities are lying to students by telling them
[50:11.600 --> 50:14.480]  they will be refused enrollment if they don't take the shots according to the
[50:14.480 --> 50:17.480]  sources they're now telling you you can't get student assistance and welfare
[50:17.480 --> 50:22.040]  to if you don't take them that's a lie too this has led to a staggering 15%
[50:22.040 --> 50:26.600]  decline in students enrolling since January and forced ACC to cancel 500
[50:26.600 --> 50:32.320]  classes over the next semester alone and it's trending towards a thousand when
[50:32.320 --> 50:37.120]  students are asked why they're dropping out or failing to enroll huge amounts of
[50:37.120 --> 50:41.760]  them are citing the institution's aggressive vaccination policy according
[50:41.760 --> 50:46.040]  to the administrator a similar pattern of dropouts to the students revolting over
[50:46.040 --> 50:49.840]  vaccines as being witnessed across the country this is a big whistleblower

[55:13.320 --> 55:19.280]  amendment I already knew this but turns out judicial watch got the documents the
[55:19.280 --> 55:27.160]  White House basically scripted the new Navy SEAL movie really think so we've

[56:06.200 --> 56:11.160]  it going Alex good well listen I had something that I'd like to kind of tip
[56:11.160 --> 56:15.480]  you on there you I noticed that you're doing an extensive look into the drone
[56:15.480 --> 56:21.200]  situation we've got a really odd situation going on in the northeastern
[56:21.200 --> 56:29.200]  corner of Washington here in our county we've got a former FEMA director
[56:29.200 --> 56:35.520]  living here in a tiny little town and he happens to be the executive vice
[56:35.520 --> 56:42.080]  president for a corporation in New York City called L3 now what you're going to
[56:42.080 --> 56:48.480]  find interesting is L3 not only manufacturers tests and trains FEMA on
[56:48.480 --> 56:54.840]  how to use a wide variety of drones with numerous facilities but they also
[56:54.840 --> 56:59.800]  manufacture the hacking equipment that they're using to monitor the internet
[56:59.800 --> 57:06.280]  with and they also manufacture the little handheld FEMA narrowband communicators
[57:06.280 --> 57:11.480]  that are going to be used for the so-called good guys to be able to
[57:11.480 --> 57:17.160]  identify one another now I'm fully aware of L3 monstrous group they service the
[57:17.160 --> 57:22.560]  Blackhawks all of it and it it is the defense system that Eisenhower warned
[57:22.560 --> 57:27.960]  us of eating absorbing America with our money while wrapping it all in American
[57:27.960 --> 57:32.520]  flags and they are gearing up they're getting all the police on the FEMA
[57:32.520 --> 57:36.600]  bandwidth so we can't listen to their communications they're gearing up with
[57:36.600 --> 57:43.360]  armored pill boxes 40 caliber you know 450 million rounds for total war against
[57:43.360 --> 57:46.680]  the American people during a designed collapse that America will is supposed
[57:46.680 --> 57:50.880]  to never come back out of and it's it's the fall of America it's the total
[57:50.880 --> 57:55.960]  takeover of our country well they also came up here and confiscated more or
[57:55.960 --> 58:00.800]  less our county commission gave it away the spineless creatures that they are
[58:00.800 --> 58:07.840]  gave away our easement on the eastern side of the county to the Department of
[58:07.840 --> 58:14.560]  Homeland Security who is building a 45 million dollar superport and it's going
[58:14.560 --> 58:20.280]  to feature a drone launching pad they're gonna have helicopter drones they're
[58:20.280 --> 58:23.880]  gonna have winged drones they've got course I mean you got a lot of
[58:23.880 --> 58:26.520]  patriots out there that got to be watched and you got to spend their tax

[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.600]  up in your phone calls first all right now let's go to Peter in Washington Peter
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:48.760]  you're on the air go ahead yes Alex I'd like to talk just briefly about the New
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:55.000]  World Order and Marxism yes now Karl Marx talked about the higher stages of
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.080]  communism which would involve the withering away of the state he even
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.240]  talked about fishing in the morning and and hunting in the afternoon you could
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.000]  do now how would that be practical well I think you supply the answer with your
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:18.920]  analysis of eugenics that really Marxism does not require a government even
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:29.000]  unlike fascism and that this whole thing is consistent with Marxism alone no
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.120]  no that's it Marxism though is not the final phase you know they say total
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.600]  government and then it you know socialism total communism but that's just to
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.640]  bring in the new system which is designed to kill almost everyone because
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.320]  it's a system created by the British royalty for eugenics to reduce
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.760]  population and so absolutely it is the post-industrial kill group and they
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.120]  sell lazy nobodies to be the exterminators in the first phase then
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:01.840]  they're exterminated next then a bio weapon exterminates the last group
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:10.240]  yes mm-hmm yeah that's that's it but you see these these people as I see them
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:16.520]  are you know some of them are ripoff artists but the the more intellectual
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:21.880]  ones are really Marxist and then they will be the only people and that's
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.120]  consistent with what you talked about no that's what they say that's why the
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.680]  communists always get into eugenics because they are eugenics the Rothschild
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.320]  and Rockefellers it's all declassified on record created the Soviet Union and
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.800]  put Mao say tongue in power and told him kill well the Chinese say 84 million
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.520]  people we say 64 but I mean this was this is what they do if you look at what
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:54.880]  Mao did it's what they're bringing in here yeah well thank you yeah I mean
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.680]  what do you make of them now just announcing 30,000 armed drones to just
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.400]  kill us whenever they want I mean this this is out of control part of this
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.840]  whole thing that that you've described so well better I think than than
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:14.200]  anybody I've ever come across and you know the higher stages of communism
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:22.240]  communism is ultimately a betrayal and it's more than just some financiers
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.080]  these financiers are part of the of the of the system they are required you
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.520]  might even call them the devil's paymaster yeah well that's exactly
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.160]  that's in the communist 10 planks they say central banks bankers and it's a
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.800]  religion that's why they always ban Christianity because every top
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.480]  communist if you study history is actually a Luciferian devil worshipper
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.360]  they're devil worshippers what do you think devils create they create this
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:55.440]  monstrosity abortion poverty pain everything ugly it's it's unbelievable
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.280]  what's about to happen

[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.520]  wallets when somebody opens their wallet to give them the driver's license the
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.960]  police say let me see that they take your wallet and take the money out and
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:54.720]  say you can challenge this but if you do I'm gonna take you to jail chances are

[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:33.040]  criticism of reported arrest quota officers union Miami Beach brass order
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.960]  2,000 arrest over holiday yeah it's the union that orders everything these
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.040]  unions run everything that's why you go to New York and they huge potbelly cop
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:48.760]  smoking cigars beating women up I mean it's like idiocracy or something I
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.920]  reported arrest quota for Memorial Day weekend is causing anger and concern
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:12:02.560]  among community activists and union officers in Miami kind of union always
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:09.600]  plays good cop bad cop so some of the police are doing the right thing and
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.560]  complaining to the union rumors of the quota which allegedly calls for 2,000
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.440]  people to be arrested over the holiday weekend first came to light an email
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.920]  complaint from an officer's union in that email the union called the quota
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.800]  aggressive patently unfair and unjust so here I am blaming the union they're
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.680]  actually saying don't do it then there's another article here with the unions
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:32.200]  actually saying it's okay I don't know it's all politics but I tell you what
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:38.600]  police you're going to be obsolete soon think about how much things have
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:44.000]  changed in just five years in eight years the system plans to have most
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.480]  police work done by robot vans they already have a bunch of states where
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:54.480]  robot cars are driving where a robot cop actually walks up to your car this is
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.840]  happening all these little swords and wheeled vehicles you see that's 30 year
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.160]  old technology now I told you the drones were coming to the skies and people
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.040]  like oh yeah right this is all planned robots on the ground
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.400]  japan's already actually got them controlling traffic in some test and
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:18.200]  these things walk right up to you this is so hellish
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.080]  it'll say well you know the robot is programmed and it went ahead and
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.320]  tasered you because you were non-compliant look at this story out of
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:36.480]  my fox florida teen has diploma withheld over the fact that he kneeled that he
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:43.800]  knelt during the graduation ceremony you see they lie and say no religion in
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.920]  schools that's because you can't have one state religion you can't have the
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.680]  school say everyone must be a Buddhist everyone must be a Catholic everyone
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:56.400]  must be a Muslim if you go to this school that's all separation of church of
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.600]  state is and all that is is a letter from Thomas Jefferson saying you can't
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:03.800]  have the government order you to follow say the guy or religion as they're
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.520]  trying to do right now which is nothing to with the earth is the way they
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.720]  package it it's really an anti-human religion so that's the type of police
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:18.280]  state developments here and it goes on to say diploma withheld embarrassed
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:24.640]  publicly and ordered to clean the gym over the fact that he knelt during the
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.840]  ceremony and thank God and they tell you you have no free speech I've seen
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:37.200]  cases in Texas where somebody brings a Bible in their bag and they take it and
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.480]  throw it in the trash and have the police arrest them there's no law but
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:45.640]  the cop does whatever they're told and of course letter they're released but
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.960]  this we're not a free country like you think you've got to admit this takeovers
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:57.000]  happen if we're going to reverse this it's staggering to see this happen a
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.960]  Florida teenager had his diploma withheld and was ordered to clean the
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:06.800]  school gym as punishment for t-boing on stage during his graduation ceremony and
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.440]  again ladies and gentlemen I want you to listen to me very very carefully here
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:16.600]  it was even his mother that thought it should happen because of her political
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.720]  correctness believing that there's no free speech in a school you can go in a
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.240]  school and say that you think Obama is a criminal and give evidence of it now
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.480]  they can tell you don't talk during that period if everybody else can't talk but
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:35.000]  you can't have a big political discussion in social studies socialist
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.680]  studies see how it's all hidden in plain view human resources you're seen as a
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.600]  resource see how it's all hiding in plain view like you're an idiot they just
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:47.240]  normalize all this she says you can be arrested if you talk about about him
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:54.120]  this is what's being taught and all over the country they have people that sue if
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:58.400]  anyone prays I've seen lawsuits just in Texas where I live I've seen them all
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:06.840]  over the country where if a coach prays with his athletes or her athletes before
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:13.680]  or during halftime it's said to be offensive and the game is forfeited or
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:19.760]  lawsuits are filed by the other team in San Antonio a few months ago they chanted
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.800]  USA because it's a military town the other team was local as well it is kind
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.560]  of a mindless chant anytime you know there's a police state thing habitable
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:32.560]  chant USA the point is they said it was racist and banned saying USA all over the
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.920]  country you can't wear an American flag in schools because the illegal aliens
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.560]  find it offensive look that up that's mainstream news they're training you that
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:44.400]  there's no free speech and the younger generations being trained that their
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.880]  parents aren't in charge that the state is in charge and that vaccines are the
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:54.240]  law and now they tell students you've seen this in the news countless times
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:00.400]  around graduation it's happening right now in the news they say do not you're
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.720]  if you're the valor Victorian or the salutatorian or the people that are
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:09.560]  speaking or if you're having a guest speaker even if a congressman is coming
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.960]  to speak I saw a case of this one in Florida same state as this is happening
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.560]  I told him do not say a prayer do not thank God and they're telling high
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:23.640]  school football players and basketball players do not thank God at any award
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.960]  ceremonies you could get up there and say I want to thank my dad I want to
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.960]  thank my mom I want to thank my coach I want to thank my grandfather I want to
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.440]  thank my grandmother I want to thank Jesus Christ I want to thank Allah I want
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:40.840]  to thank Buddha I want to thank the Kibler elves I want to think you know
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:49.920]  the lucky charms I want to thank Willy Wonka but this is with this is
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.840]  outrageous I've had TSA when I start telling him hey that lady she's allowed
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.240]  to have three ounces that's a two ounce you shut your mouth you're not gonna
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.480]  fly all right well you do whatever you got to but I'm gonna formally sue you
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:07.520]  and you may even beat the rap you're not gonna beat the ride they'll just say get
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.920]  out of here get out of here I forget which flight it was one time they're like
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:16.080]  what is this they always do that with a 35 millimeter camera you know video
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.680]  camera and I go you know what it is you're just trying to act like I'm
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.320]  guilty for some power tripping you've been told to train us to be prisoners
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:26.920]  you're too stupid to understand all of what's happening you enjoying the cancer
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.160]  you're gonna get cancer from these x-ray machines and these scanners just get
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:36.000]  out of here yeah I'm not scared of you oh you're gonna have fun the next little
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.760]  kid comes through see I'm done I'm done I see you I know you I studied this 24
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:54.920]  7 I'm right you're wrong period and I'm not afraid anymore and again 15% of
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.840]  people are not reenrolling previous the other number they project they're
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:04.240]  they're gonna cancel 500 classes in the summer it could be a thousand and one of
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.760]  the biggest community college systems in the world Austin Community College and
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:14.040]  look what's on their front page bacterial meningitis is requirement guess
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.480]  whoever took that shot so brain damage is not even separated I guess it's a
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:24.600]  spell meningitis the point is let's put it back up on screen there it's a
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:29.280]  requirement not a law they're supposed to give you the waiver for the policy but
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.320]  the battle with the administrators is they go look we're gonna we're totally
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:38.080]  imploding here doesn't matter the brain damaging the soft killing of people is
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:43.840]  more important that they'd be implanted but those viruses and heavy metals then
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:50.160]  that they that is so what some escape they'll get them later to have a job to
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.240]  live they're gonna try to make you take shots they're now giving kids shots in
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.840]  California without parental consent so there you go you can't go to college
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.760]  unless you get the deadly bio weapon I'd seen the ungevity products work for
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:06.040]  many others and so I bought a bunch of them started using them had a little
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:10.640]  bit of results but I wasn't following the regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in

[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:06.480]  Monkton yesterday it was fantastic and I just wanted to ask you a question you
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:14.280]  got the new social network up and running I joined but I was wondering it
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:23.600]  would it is is it possible for you to put up a video on there where somebody
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:29.440]  with that's very good at research could help people to learn how to research
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:34.000]  because a lot of the people that I reach a lot of people I speak to and you know
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.680]  as I post articles on Facebook and so on these people they really don't know
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:44.160]  how to research they have no idea how they could look up this thing you know
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.480]  these things to verify them oh my gosh I mean there's like probably over a hundred
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.040]  articles a day and government documents at info wars.com alone all they got to
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:59.000]  do is go to info wars.com all of my films are free online they have the
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:04.880]  articles as I say it or the clips from Congress I mean if people don't know
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.600]  we're in trouble they're not paying attention as the bumper sticker says I
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.960]  mean I don't know what else I can say the system admits they're overthrowing
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.240]  the bill of rights and Constitution I can't do everything I mean I was up
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:24.080]  here till 10 o'clock last night again yesterday I'm not even doing the nightly
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.320]  news right now the crew is I'm getting ready for Bilderberg I'll be doing it
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.200]  some of it from there I'm doing the radio show everything and people are
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.680]  always like well where's your proof the Rockefeller Foundation had plans to put
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.240]  sterilants and vaccines just type in Rockefeller Foundation documents
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:47.040]  sterilants and vaccines and it will put it in the search engine just put in the
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:51.600]  search engine what I say and that will come up with links to them but they're
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.600]  they don't hide this the White House science are says sterilize people he
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:03.000]  doesn't hide it the big journal of you know bioethics has killed children up
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.920]  to age three including healthy ones sounds insane it is insane that's what
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.280]  Hitler was insane and that really happened to people like I say Hitler
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:15.040]  killed millions of people well where's the proof of that well here it is people
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.960]  always say Hitler didn't kill anybody it was a nice guy they're like but we do
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.960]  need to kill all the Jews though you know Hitler didn't kill any Jews but we
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.920]  need to kill him he didn't he didn't kill enough of them I'm like oh there it is
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:29.480]  now there's a president's five-year review an annual report in 1968 the
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:37.200]  Rockefeller Foundation and that got got declassified in 2001 and that's the
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:42.440]  sterilants in your shots and little double cancer in there too it implants
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.040]  itself in your cell walls it's designed on average when you harmonially get up
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.920]  to the age of retirement that then the replication begins and your immune
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.560]  system fails there they want to soft kill you at around 60 a little little
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:59.040]  before retirement but you know it kind of your kid but there's greedy interest
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.200]  getting in there with so many shots for your five-year-old a lot of times they
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:06.760]  succumb to the blackout but hey the preacher will well we'll be at the
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.440]  meeting and talk about how your child's in a better place when you lower them
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:14.120]  into the into the ground because everybody knows it couldn't be as bad as
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.000]  Alex says so just keep rolling your slaves up I mean I don't know what I
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.400]  can say sir I mean the guys just typed in Rockefeller Foundation sterilants and
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:29.240]  vaccines their own report came up what do you say to that yeah I know it the
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:35.440]  thing is it's not a problem for me I I find it because they don't want to
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:41.360]  understand that you know it really what's been going on what's going on
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:46.320]  right now is really you really want to look at it you know we've swallowed we

[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:28.000]  understand how it's being manipulated Mike's immigrant plan to save cities I
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.160]  got a document it's actually in my car I forgot to bring it in with it just
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:35.280]  breaks down everything they're setting up gun free zones all over the country
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:40.720]  Bloomberg and a manual outside of law with big foundation money I mean these
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:47.160]  are crooks this is the guy that wants to fine you $2,000 if you use salt in your
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.240]  restaurant Mike's immigrant plan to save cities
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:55.560]  ratcheting up controversial proposal for revitalizing America cities mayor
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:58.960]  Bloomberg yesterday suggested the federal government deliberately forced
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:05.080]  large municipalities deliberately force the feds for cities just forget states
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:09.480]  forget anything you see we got an empire now I crawl wrote on their times
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.440]  we're an empire now we'll do whatever we want you mean the bankers that run us
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:17.240]  for an empire now ratcheting up his controversial proposal for revitalizing
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:20.400]  America cities mayor Bloomberg yesterday suggested the federal government
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:24.200]  deliberately forced that's a quote large municipalities to take in immigrants as
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:29.800]  the only hope of salvaging their battered economies battered by you with
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:36.760]  literally 80 plus was 83 new taxes I saw last year alone in New York 83 new
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:41.400]  taxes the mayor also criticized President Obama for deporting more
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:44.680]  immigrants than the last four five presidents put together that's all just
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:49.320]  show they did they deport a few thousand Bloomberg spoke at Midtown forum time to
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:52.840]  release of a new study titled not coming to America why the US is falling
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:56.920]  behind the global race we have the highest immigration in the world and
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:01.560]  here's the deal immigrants are actually good for this country if there's no
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:07.080]  welfare they are good because then you get the ones that want to work and they
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:13.840]  are good they are hard-working they're not spoiled rotten yuppies trash three or
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:18.760]  four generations of thumbs sucking hippies who job but they're coming here
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:21.600]  with Ford Foundation running the universities and they're teaching them
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.080]  to be anti-gun pro-abortion anti-family and so they are the enemy of this
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:31.640]  country 90 plus percent of immigrants when they end up becoming citizens vote
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:35.680]  Democratic Party I know Republicans are a bad choice too but the point is they
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:42.200]  want to end this country they've got to all be kicked out of here we've got to
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:47.880]  stop it down to zero because the globalists are using them to drive a
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.280]  wedge in this country if there was no welfare federally you could have it
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:56.760]  locally for people really down and out real charity that I'd be yeah we can
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:00.520]  take millions of immigrants a year because that's the type we want we do
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:06.280]  not want I mean these people get here they US hospitals advertise in Mexico
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.040]  to come up here and have your baby free and then the hospitals are all going
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.960]  bankrupt so then you've got to have national health care because they've
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:16.520]  bankrupted the charity hospitals you know 30% of hospital work until about 15
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:21.280]  years ago new doctors were told you will do 30% of your work for free that was
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:25.600]  normal people like Ron Paul used to 30% of the time work at charity hospitals for
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:29.800]  free because that's what you're supposed to do it's not about at being out of the
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:33.800]  golf course all day it's the Hippocratic oath it is a sacred honor to be a
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:38.640]  physician like the hospitlers that's where the word comes from these were
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:42.520]  volunteer nurses and doctors that would go and take care of people that's where
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:49.600]  the word hospital comes from it is a it is a Christian thing of charity oh we've
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:54.600]  gotten off of a path of the path at least the prosperity and freedom we're
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:59.680]  going down a rat hole ladies and gentlemen if the globalists are for it
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:04.620]  I'm against it isn't that simple if the globalist are for it we have to be
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:09.480]  against it if the globalist are for it we have to be against it if the globalist
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:13.940]  or for it we have to be against it if the globalist or for it we have to be
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:16.680]  against it if the globalist or for it we have to be against it
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:19.200]  I can intellectually show you how they're for it. It's always bad
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:25.640]  But it's a real simple rule if the devil is for something you better be against it real simple not hard to figure out
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:36.880]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls. I'm gonna shut up now Josh in California. You're on the air go ahead
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:42.280]  Yeah, how you doing man? The red hole is getting pretty deep isn't it? Oh, yeah, it's moving fast now
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:48.760]  Yeah, I'm doing everything I can to just not eject out of this country out of pure selfishness, but I'm not I've sworn to go down
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:51.360]  With the ship go ahead. Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do man
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:58.080]  I have a couple questions about you know, you were stating about earlier about the the retinal scanners and the grocery stores
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:02.220]  Yes, hidden retina scanners that I learned of 12 years ago. Now it's mainstream this
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:08.680]  Yeah, yeah, my question is I can't see I'm blind. Can they look into people's eyes that can't see?
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:16.240]  If your eyes are open, oh, whoa, that's scary. My next question is the H1N1 shot
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:19.720]  I have actually gotten the vaccine. My question is
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:24.560]  If I go get tested for cancer from this shot
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:31.480]  Would I be allowed to go to federal court and try to attempt to sue the pharmaceutical company?
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.960]  No, because they've created a liability fund where you go through a special court
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:39.720]  That isn't a real court and even if you're one out of I think it's one out of
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:46.820]  Ten the last number I saw very few people even win and then you sign agreements for a paltry sum
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:49.200]  You know your kids dead or brain damaged
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:55.200]  And those are the lucky ones where the kid collapses there in the hospital and has the convulsion so they can prove
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:01.120]  It was the shot so they just put it on the insert cancer brain damage narcolepsy neurological disorders
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:06.920]  And then they just go hey, you should have read the the insert, but listen, there's a new industry where they're doing
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:11.520]  Cancer testing we all get cancer every day then they go in and cut out things like
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.480]  They do cancer all the times where people swallow
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.880]  You know a seed out of an apple gets in your lungs
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:21.240]  In fact a statistic show a lot of people have that my grandmother
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:28.120]  They think it was an apple seed in her lung chopped the lung out gave her ten years of miserable life after it screwed up her heart
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:32.520]  Paralyzed part of her face and they're like oops. Sorry, but she's old-fashioned doesn't sue
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.280]  Yeah, it was a
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.560]  Particulate in there
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:43.000]  So a lot of times, you know, you've got an apple seed or a lemon senior in your lung
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.200]  I mean a lot of people again the numbers I've seen are as many as one out of five as the last number
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.520]  I saw have a seed or something in their lung and the body just encapsulates it
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:59.720]  I mean, I've had I've been out of my bite many times when I used to ride dirt bikes. I've inhaled so many
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:05.200]  You ever had mosquitoes shoot up your nose a fly fly down your mouth. We've got bugs in our lungs, man
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.880]  And you can they're gonna go they're gonna find a cancer marker and they're gonna chop you open. I
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:15.880]  Mean a lot of the time so again, it doesn't give you cancer right away
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:22.520]  H1N1 two government studies in Canada admitted doubles your chances of getting the flu the next year, but then after that you're
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:29.040]  Immune system bounces back. We know it was a simulant. They released a year before they actually released it
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.160]  It appears it doesn't appear
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.360]  Our scientists said so but then it was confirmed it had a tracker virus
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:41.160]  We're not sure it's so highly advanced added to it, but it's got an artificial tech package really its nano tech
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:43.960]  That's what viruses are anyways natural nano tech attached to it
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:48.440]  So you were hit with a combo soft kill weapon. We don't know when it's gonna activate
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:53.440]  It's aggregated for the average unhealthy person if you get super healthy get on superfoods
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:59.840]  It may stop it from triggering but generally it's set to trigger harmonially around retirement. It's a soft kill weapon
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:02.160]  We'll be right back. Hi, this is Alex Jones
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:07.680]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:12.400]  Did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:18.000]  It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again

[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:18.400]  Look, we've got a case of charity, the likes of which the world's never seen
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:26.400]  It's naked in our face, flaming on fire, jumping up and down with bull horns announcing itself
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:31.400]  Yeah, we got reeducation camps, yeah, we're gonna get you, they want to intimidate us
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:39.400]  And so many people, and I'm going back to your calls, call me over the years, I see comments going, Alex Jones is here to scare us
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:46.400]  And I think about that, if somebody came to me and said, there's a guy, there's a gang going house to house robbing people
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:51.400]  I wouldn't go, how dare you come to my house and scare me, I'd say, thank you, let me get my firearms
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:56.400]  I mean, it's already happening, knowing is good
[01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:04.400]  I went down to the creek, and one of my children hadn't gotten the water yet, and they go, look out daddy, it's a big snake
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:10.400]  And I don't want to scare my wife, but she's listening, I think it was a big water moccasin, now she won't go out of the creek and go swimming
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:16.400]  I gotta get down there and hunt those things, they come out early in the morning and at night, I'm gonna go spotlight and kill them
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:21.400]  And the point is, that'll make her happy, but I'll even shoot a YouTube of it, how's that sound?
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:27.400]  And is it this kind of snake central? And was it fear mongering?
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:34.400]  That my son said, hey, look at that big snake, while I was swimming around, of course it was trying to get away, it was going the other direction
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:43.400]  No, it was, hey, there's a snake, and so I think everybody's like I am, I mean, got a threat, it's happening, people are like, well, they're gonna get you
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:51.400]  You know what, then they are, I mean, there's no debating or discussing this, okay?
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:56:00.400]  I'm not hardcore enough, this is so hardcore, they're killing us, look around you, how many people you know got cancer?
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:06.400]  A lot of you won't look up the statistics and find out what I'm saying is true, so just how many of you know people that have cancer?
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:13.400]  If you're 60, 70, 80 years old, you remember kids with cancer when you were growing up? Never heard of it, had you?
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:18.400]  Did people seem this dumbed down and this unable to focus?
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:26.400]  All the numbers are there, the IQs are dropping, the attention spans are dropping, the language is getting smaller, people are using less words
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:33.400]  This is scientific, and I have all the documents, and I want it to stop, it's that simple
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.400]  Yeah, there's the New York Times cancer on the rise
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:44.400]  And that's a whitewash article, and who leads the world in everything?
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:50.400]  Us, we're being murdered, and people are like, but it's our government, it's not our government
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:58.400]  We were taken over by eugenicists that are so smart, they don't have a guy in a dictator outfit going seek high all up there, somebody like Stalin
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:05.400]  They just have fake politicians, fake fronts, billboards, how the government loves you everywhere, and they're just killing you behind the scenes
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.400]  Let's go to another call here, Daryl and Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:10.400]  Hello sir
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:11.400]  Yes sir
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:20.400]  Two things if I may, you hit it on the spot earlier where you said the immigrants that they, when they come here, that they were a tart and brainwash would be Democrats
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:28.400]  For example, my family who's Jamaican, my father died when I was nine, when I was nine from walking pneumonia, mother was still alive
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:35.400]  But she was raised to be a Democrat here, she voted for Clinton because that's what she was taught, Democrats were good
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:41.400]  She voted for Obama because that's what she was taught, because they were taught, Democrats were good
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:48.400]  I can understand because they wanted to get a black person in office, told them to understand the concept, they come up for the black community
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:52.400]  I'm like, if that's the case, you want to vote for a racist, you want to vote against him and Kenny
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.400]  But of course, when I say stuff like that, they just get lost and
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:58:02.400]  Well sure, I mean look, look at all the media hype, the system is promoting someone, the system is evil, it's a no brainer
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:08.400]  People have to stop getting into hype, they've got to learn to recognize it and get nauseous
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:14.400]  When I see hype, I get sick, and I see the general public gets all happy when they see the hype
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:15.400]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:20.400]  Yes, it's definitely disgusting, that's why I started my rally in August for people that's in the Atlanta area
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:24.400]  So I'll take it to the media, we need to get out there and just show them that we're here
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:28.400]  Did you get any response the last time you plugged the rally you're going to have?
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:33.400]  Yeah, I got a few, a few people contacting me, a few people from out of the state contacting me
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:36.400]  Alright, tell us the name of the rally real fast
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:38.400]  It's called Take It to the Media
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:45.400]  Take it to the media in Atlanta
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:11.400]  These filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:15.400]  There's no priming required, it's NSF42 certified
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:19.400]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%
[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:22.400]  Easy to set up and use, doesn't require electricity
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:25.400]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:28.400]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals which is key
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.400]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:35.400]  Pro Pure is the best gravity fed filter out there
[01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:40.400]  That's what my family uses Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Pro Pure
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:43.400]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout

[02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:22.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:28.400]  Alright, Dr. Corsi from Hawaii, looking into who Barry Citero, aka Barack Obama really is
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:35.400]  With breaking news coming up. Doris in Tennessee, here on the air, welcome
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:37.400]  Hey, Alex
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:38.400]  Hi
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:45.400]  I watched a movie last night called The End of America, a letter of warning to a young patriot
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:48.400]  I'm sure you know who Naomi Wolf is
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:49.400]  Yes
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:53.400]  She did that movie and she gives 10 steps
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:56.400]  I'd recommend that movie for anybody
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:08.400]  How a government will move towards a fascist to destroy the setting Republican government
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:14.400]  And the first thing they do is invoke terror, internal and external enemies, secret prisoners
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.400]  They're hyping up a non-existent terror threat
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.400]  Even if Al Qaeda was real and not working for the globalist
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.400]  You got a better chance of a honey bee killing you
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:24.400]  I mean, literally, it's a joke
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:30.400]  Land of the free home of the brave on its knees to men in black uniforms saying save us from Kibler Elves
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:35.400]  Right, and about the pale horse
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:38.400]  About Charlie Daniels has that
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:43.400]  He's gonna narrate that movie about the pale horse, beheld the pale horse
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:50.400]  And then Hart Webster Turfley talking about the Mormon thing about the pale horse
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:55.400]  Well, the pale horse in the book of Revelation chapter 6 says
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:56.400]  I looked it up
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:57.400]  It's death
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.400]  It's death and hell followed with it
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:05.400]  And then you study that word hell, it doesn't mean the place hell
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:11.400]  It means this is pictured here as a terrible monster
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:18.400]  Hell means death, destruction, burning cities, black uniforms, torture
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:20.400]  That's what hell is
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:22.400]  Hell is being released
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:26.400]  The Bill of Rights and Constitution are morals dropping shields down
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:32.400]  In floods, like opening a submarine door, in floods the icy water of tyranny
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:35.400]  And you're right about everything
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:38.400]  Just about everything you say
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:43.400]  I've been preaching this for quite some time, just like you have to people
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:47.400]  And you have to be called crazy to get people to listen to you
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:50.400]  Now people are starting to get hungry
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:54.400]  They're actually starting to get hungry physically
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.400]  That's what I'm finding, people are starting to wake up
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:58.400]  God bless you
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:00.400]  Believe me, folks
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:02.400]  Everywhere I go, I run into listeners
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.400]  I ran to a fellow yesterday who just been to Australia and he said
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:09.400]  Man, all over, people go, you're from Texas?
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.400]  Alex Jones
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:14.400]  He went to a church and people were all listeners
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:16.400]  I mean, it's big, folks
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.400]  That's why I don't feel like I'm worthy
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:23.400]  I mean, I've got, conservatively, 15 million listeners a week now
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:27.400]  And, in fact, that's an old number
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:30.400]  It's more like 20 million now
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:35.400]  And it's just growing exponentially, it is such a responsibility
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:37.400]  All I can do is just keep warning people
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:40.400]  John in Pennsylvania, got about a minute and a half, go ahead
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:45.400]  I was wondering why you don't ever interview Kevin Trudeau anymore
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:48.400]  Well, I interviewed Kevin twice
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.400]  Not that I even totally agree with everything he says
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:53.400]  Because the government was trying to block his book about herbs
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:55.400]  Because he's an interesting person
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:58.400]  But that's why, I mean, I just had him on
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:03.400]  There's some guests we have on a couple times that we haven't had back on
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:06.400]  Well, with Bilderberg coming up, I think it would be a great interview
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:09.400]  If you did him again, because the last one I really enjoyed
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:13.400]  Yeah, I mean, he said he was in a yacht off the coast of where they were having their meeting
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:16.400]  And I'm sure that's true, he's a big jet setter
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:18.400]  But I have sources inside Bilderberg
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:22.400]  And so, not that are Bilderbergs, but I have sources inside Bilderberg
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:27.400]  And so this is going to be a year that won't be one to forget
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:30.400]  I'm looking forward to it, keep up to the work, thanks for everything
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.400]  Thank you, my friend. Okay, we're going to come right back after this quick break
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:37.400]  And I believe we're going to have about our course, he was supposed to be on an hour ago
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:39.400]  But he's like, I'm in a war zone, I think was the quote
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:42.400]  There's so much coming up, I'm here with the chief investigator
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:45.400]  Oh my gosh, and I've never heard him really hyped up like that
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:48.400]  So I wouldn't say Jerome Corsi has high pinning
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:51.400]  So we'll find out what's up, Doc

[02:07:56.400 --> 02:08:22.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:29.400]  Dr. Jerome Corsi has breaking news
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:32.400]  He couldn't even come on with us in the last hour
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:38.400]  He is there with the head of the cold-case posse from Maricopa County, Arizona in Hawaii
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:44.400]  When he was on with us with an update on Obama and his publicist for 16-plus years
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:48.400]  Saying that he was born in Kenya
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:52.400]  Then Arpaio demanded they release documents
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:55.400]  But it looks like this is a new fraud
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:57.400]  Just like the old fraud
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:59.400]  They can't even get straight which hospital he was born at
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:00.400]  That's all coming up
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:02.400]  We just had him, but his Skype dropped
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:04.400]  We're reconnecting right now
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.400]  Let me just also plug here
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.400]  And your purchase supports the broadcast as well
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:12.400]  These things are basically out of print
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:17.400]  And Carol Quigley is on record saying that he's mad that they're back in print before he died
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:21.400]  This is a top global, let's give an access to the New World Order's archives
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:25.400]  He wrote tragedy and hope, a history of the world in our time
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:27.400]  Bill Clinton's mentor
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:29.400]  Bill Clinton said
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:33.400]  I heard that call clarified by a professor I had named Carol Quigley
[02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:37.400]  The powers of financial capitalism had a far-reaching plan
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:41.400]  Nothing less than create a world system of financial control
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:46.400]  In private hands able to dominate the political system of each country
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:49.400]  And the economy of the world as a whole
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:54.400]  And we have Peter E. Krogan
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:57.400]  Dean of the School of Foreign Service, Georgetown says
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:00.400]  He was one of the last of the great macro historians
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:04.400]  Who traced the development of civilization with an awesome capability
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.400]  The definitive work on the world's power structure
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:10.400]  Now you want to understand why the mega-capitalist
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:13.400]  Create communist systems to consolidate power
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:16.400]  He explains all this and how the New World Order is a system
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:18.400]  Where they're above the law and you're a slave
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:20.400]  It's giant, it's 1400 pages
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.400]  It is full of incredible information
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:25.400]  It's available at infowars.com
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:27.400]  Show his bloodline as the Illuminati
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:29.400]  Show his a noble line, Oklahoma City
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.400]  Exposing the inside job that was that event
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:33.400]  Do we have course yet?
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:37.400]  Alright, it's skyped, dropped, yep
[02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:39.400]  Then go to plan B after about three minutes
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:43.400]  I want to kick in to call in this hotel room
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.400]  I want to go to plan B, okay, thank you
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:49.400]  Alright, continuing, talk about a build-up here
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:51.400]  He couldn't come on last hour when he was scheduled
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.400]  Now this, I want to find out
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:56.400]  He's over there investigating
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:58.400]  One of the chief advisors of the Cold Case Posse
[02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:00.400]  And he's got a bunch of news
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:03.400]  So that's coming up and we're able to get him
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:05.400]  On the line with us
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:07.400]  We'll just abort this in a minute
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:09.400]  All day going over this and over this and up
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:11.400]  Okay, so we've got him there
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:12.400]  That's good
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:14.400]  Coming up, there's a big revolt
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:17.400]  In Texas, 15% people are not re-enrolling
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:20.400]  In the colleges, and this is a whistleblower
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:22.400]  This is directly from a high-level administrator
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:24.400]  Because they're forcing deadly vaccines on people
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:25.400]  They're having bad reactions
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:27.400]  And they won't even tell them there's a waiver
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:29.400]  The administrators don't want to have all these dropouts
[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:32.400]  But they're told you're not allowed to tell people
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:36.400]  And that's the big issue, so we're breaking that news
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:39.400]  It's at infowars.com, it's also at my Twitter
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:41.400]  Real Alex Jones at Twitter
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:43.400]  So just go to twitter.com for us, Real Alex Jones
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:46.400]  We've also launched the new social network
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:48.400]  PlanetInfoWars.com
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:51.400]  And tens of thousands of people signed up
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:53.400]  Obviously we're going through some tweaking
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:55.400]  It's slow sometimes
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:57.400]  We're adding more servers
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:00.400]  We'll get it where it's, it's why it's in beta
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:06.400]  So bear with us at planetinfowars.com
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:08.400]  So be sure and check that out as well
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:10.400]  And please spread the word
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:13.400]  Okay, going now with breaking news
[02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:16.400]  Is Dr. Jerome Corsi, PhD
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:18.400]  From Harvard University in political science
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:20.400]  He's also worked in areas of high finance
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:22.400]  He also worked in national security
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:25.400]  For the State Department in war zones
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:27.400]  In the Middle East and other areas
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:29.400]  And obviously worked in intelligence capacities
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:30.400]  To get into that
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:32.400]  He's written five New York Times best sellers
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:34.400]  Including two number ones
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:37.400]  And the White House responded last year
[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:39.400]  Releasing the fake birth certificate
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:42.400]  About a week before his book was going to come out
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:43.400]  The White House ran the hoax
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:44.400]  That his book had been recalled
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:47.400]  They don't do that if they're not desperate
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:50.400]  Now, obviously last week
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:52.400]  We learned that his publicist for 16 years
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.400]  In hundreds of different communications
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:55.400]  And publications they put out
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:56.400]  Said he was born in Kenya
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.400]  That information provided by Obama
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:00.400]  That's standard
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:02.400]  You provide your bio to the publicist
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.400]  Where you're from, what you did
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:07.400]  And the first black president
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:08.400]  Of the Harvard Law Review
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:10.400]  From Kenya, born in Kenya
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:12.400]  Boom, his wife sang
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:14.400]  Born in Kenya, we visited his homeland
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.400]  On video
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:17.400]  Boom, we're told there is no long form
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:18.400]  It doesn't exist
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:20.400]  Oh yeah, here it is, it's fake
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:22.400]  He was never named Barry Seterro
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:23.400]  Here's the records
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:24.400]  I was Barry Seterro
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:25.400]  I didn't go to Indonesia
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:26.400]  You gotta give up your citizenship
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:28.400]  At that time to become Indonesian
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:29.400]  Oh, I did go to a mosque
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:32.400]  The point is, everything he said is a lie
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:33.400]  Okay?
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.400]  And Jerome Corsi joins us now
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:37.400]  Via video Skype from Hawaii
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:38.400]  He was there Sunday
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.400]  But he didn't want us to tell you that
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:43.400]  Now they're claiming they've released new stuff
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.400]  Under our piles request
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:45.400]  And the state's request
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:46.400]  Proving he is
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:49.400]  You're giving us this breaking news here
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:51.400]  We thank you, doctor, for that
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:52.400]  And worldanddaily.com
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:54.400]  Tell us what's happening
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:58.400]  Well, I've been in Hawaii here for the entire week
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:03.400]  With Mike Zulu and the posse, the sheriff's investigators
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:05.400]  And the breaking news is yesterday
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.400]  We're quite convinced that our being here in Hawaii
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.400]  Is one of the reasons the Hawaii Department of Health
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:16.400]  Tried to verify Obama's birth in Hawaii
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:19.400]  To the state, secretary of state in Arizona
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:23.400]  Now, what they did was a very clever thing here in Hawaii
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:25.400]  Now, they got a group of lawyers together
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:29.400]  And they wrote a verification that is a non-verification
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:31.400]  If you read it very carefully
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:33.400]  And say, what did they verify?
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:36.400]  Hawaii did not verify that the birth certificate
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:38.400]  On the White House website is accurate
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:41.400]  Or that it is authentic
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:43.400]  Or that any document looks like that
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:45.400]  They didn't verify that
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:48.400]  They didn't verify that Obama was born in Hawaii
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:52.400]  What they verified was that the information
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:56.400]  On the birth certificate displayed on the White House
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:00.400]  Is information for which the Hawaii Department of Health
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:02.400]  Has a record
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:03.400]  That's all they said
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:05.400]  In other words, they said, we've got something in our file
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:10.400]  In Hawaii here that verifies that information
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:13.400]  Now, see, it's very clever because
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:15.400]  Hawaii Department of Health said, well
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:17.400]  We didn't tell you where we got the information
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:20.400]  Or if the information in our record is correct
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:23.400]  It could have easily come from the grandparents
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:25.400]  Going in and registering a birth
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:28.400]  I've always said the birth was registered
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:34.400]  But Hawaii allows the Health Department
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.400]  The Department of Health to issue a facsimile birth certificate
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:39.400]  Look at that registrar stamp
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:42.400]  It says, we verify that this is a copy
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:46.400]  Or facsimile of the information we have
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:49.400]  About this person's birth in our file
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:53.400]  So, Hawaii is not showing us the information in the file
[02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:56.400]  They are not showing the original birth certificate
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:15:57.400]  Pen and paper
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:59.400]  They're not showing the microphone film
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:01.400]  They're not showing anything
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:03.400]  They're just saying, we've got information
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:07.400]  Resembling the information on that PDF file
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:08.400]  On the White House website
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:10.400]  And Governor Abercrombie, two months before they released
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:12.400]  The last fake one said, we've looked
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:14.400]  It's not there, Obama's got a problem
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:16.400]  That's the quote
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:18.400]  It's all a lie and a cover-up
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:22.400]  Get a group of cover-leaders together
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:25.400]  To issue a non-verification verification
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:27.400]  Don't show anybody anything
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:31.400]  And get the compliant mainstream media to say
[02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:33.400]  Oh, nothing you see here, folks
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:35.400]  Move on, no wizard behind the curtain
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:38.400]  Case extended, we're done, born in Hawaii
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:40.400]  Well, it's absolutely nonsense
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:41.400]  I mean, as you pointed out
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:45.400]  In introducing this segment here, Alex
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:48.400]  For 26 years, Barack Obama's publicist
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:51.400]  Has been issuing a biographical statement
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:54.400]  That Obama himself had to provide the information for
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:56.400]  Had to verify
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:58.400]  He was born in Kenya
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:01.400]  And that has been out there for 26 years
[02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:03.400]  They wouldn't have put you on house arrest
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:06.400]  When you flew to Kenya if it wasn't true
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:08.400]  The US ambassador, you've got the letter in your book
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:10.400]  It's online, it's public
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:12.400]  Bush wanted to know when Hillary was saying all this
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:13.400]  In the campaign
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:15.400]  And they said, yeah, it's been cut out of the records
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:18.400]  You don't cut out records that weren't there
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:20.400]  Exactly, I've published those letters
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:22.400]  That went to our ambassador in Kenya
[02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:24.400]  Where Kenya says, we don't have
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:26.400]  Obama's birth certificate
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:28.400]  But that doesn't mean it wasn't here
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:30.400]  The records have been tampered with
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:32.400]  So has been criminally tampered with
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:35.400]  So as to eliminate the evidence of Obama's birth
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:37.400]  That's what Hawaii, that's what Kenya did
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:38.400]  Now, what do you mean by the fact
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:39.400]  That the chief investigator here with
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:42.400]  Is under a blackout and can't come on air?
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:44.400]  The sheriff announced yesterday
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:46.400]  Sheriff Arpaio said that he wants
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:48.400]  The investigators to come home
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:50.400]  And completely debrief him
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:52.400]  On everything that's going on here this week
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:54.400]  I've also been only able to publish
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:56.400]  What I've been allowed to publish
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:58.400]  Got tons of news here, I'm dying to get it published
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:01.400]  We will be releasing information
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:04.400]  The sheriff will be having a press conference here
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:06.400]  I'd say by the middle of June
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:08.400]  And the information...
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:10.400]  That is dangerous, you need to release it right now
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:12.400]  Don't let them write about you
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:14.400]  They've already raided the sheriff
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:16.400]  Since he opened an investigation
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:18.400]  That is why Arpaio is doing that
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:21.400]  Because he's got to have the time to get it ready
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:24.400]  But the information is going to be shared
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:27.400]  If anything happens to me or to Zulu
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:29.400]  That information is coming out
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:31.400]  At this point all they're going to do
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:33.400]  Trying to attack me if someone did
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:35.400]  In the White House
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:37.400]  It will only confirm the validity
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:39.400]  Of what we've got
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:41.400]  What I'm here to say to you now, Alex
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:44.400]  Is that we have proof
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:47.400]  That even the government did not believe
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:50.400]  That the African Barack Obama senior
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:53.400]  Was the president's father
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:56.400]  I'm completely confident of all the men alive
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:58.400]  Well you said that before it came out
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:00.400]  In the news that the State Department had said it
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:02.400]  That came out last year
[02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:04.400]  And we've got additional proof of that
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:05.400]  Wow
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:07.400]  We've got additional proof of that
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:09.400]  What I'm saying to you
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:11.400]  The additional proof
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:13.400]  You're going to see how the shutout
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:15.400]  The cover-up is occurring in Hawaii
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:17.400]  Continuing, intensifying
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:19.400]  Now you've got the White House
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:21.400]  And Hawaii cooperating
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:23.400]  With the Republican
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:25.400]  Secretary of State
[02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:27.400]  This Ken Bennett in Arizona
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:29.400]  Who by the way is co-chairman
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:31.400]  Of the Romney campaign in Arizona
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:34.400]  And wants to run for governor
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:37.400]  That this non-verification verification
[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:39.400]  Where Hawaii says
[02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:41.400]  We've got records that support
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:43.400]  The conclusion of Obama's born here
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:44.400]  You can't see them
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:46.400]  Look at the New Jersey Democrats
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:47.400]  Endorsing Romney
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:49.400]  I mean that tells you this whole thing
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:50.400]  I want to get your tag
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:52.400]  You've got Intel on the elite in Obama
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:53.400]  And Bilderberg
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:55.400]  You were talking to me all fair about that
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:57.400]  More coming up with Dr. Jerome Corsi
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:19:58.400]  WorldNetDaily.com

[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:01.400]  He's got out on this
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:03.400]  For a long time you've heard me talk about

[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:30.400]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:32.400]  Have you ever wondered why bank stock workers
[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:34.400]  Investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:36.400]  They've been available since 1986
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:38.400]  Yet the financial industry won't recognize
[02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:40.400]  The value of gold for your retirement
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:42.400]  Gold is outperformed paper investments
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:44.400]  Yet no word about IRAs
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:46.400]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement

[02:23:01.400 --> 02:23:04.400]  How can I stop these annoying collection calls?
[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:07.400]  Imagine being free from your debt without settling
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:09.400]  And with no payment plans
[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:11.400]  No negotiating or filing bankruptcy
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:12.400]  And no attorneys
[02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:14.400]  What if you could eliminate the risk
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.400]  From all your unsecured debt in about 90 days?
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:18.400]  And keep all your money

[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:24.400]  Dr. Corsi, I want you to get into the Bilderberg info
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:25.400]  That you're getting
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:27.400]  In the context of the elite, not so much the Bilderberg
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:29.400]  But you were saying, yeah, Bilderberg
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:31.400]  To quote you
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.400]  I think Obama's, you know, goose is cooked
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:35.400]  He's not going to be in there anymore
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:37.400]  You said that right before we went live
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:39.400]  What did you mean by that?
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:41.400]  Well, I think the information I'm getting
[02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:43.400]  Is that Obama is now being considered
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:46.400]  Damaged goods by the global elite
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:48.400]  The information we produced
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:51.400]  In the Sheriff Ropio's investigation
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:52.400]  Is so damaging
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:54.400]  And what's going to come down
[02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:56.400]  In the next two weeks is going to be
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:24:58.400]  So critically crippling to Obama
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:01.400]  That, you know, the Democratic Party
[02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:03.400]  Really ought to replace him as the candidate
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:05.400]  I'm told it was even discussed
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:07.400]  That Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:10.400]  Considered it and are going to pass
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:12.400]  Because they think this is going to be a tragic year
[02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:15.400]  For the Democrats just to lose massively
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:17.400]  And Obama can't recover
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.400]  There's no way he's going to recover
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:21.400]  So the globalists are going to, I think
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:23.400]  At the Bilderberger meeting
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:25.400]  They inform Obama
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:27.400]  That he's going to run and lose
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:29.400]  And inform Romney that he's going to run and win
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:31.400]  Because Romney is basically just another
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:33.400]  Variation of Obama
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:35.400]  The two of them are basically the same
[02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:37.400]  And the globalists think they can advance
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:39.400]  Their agenda more effectively
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:41.400]  With a president whose identity
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:43.400]  Is not going to be so thoroughly exposed
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:45.400]  By the way, doctor, this is big news
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:48.400]  I mean, you shot down Kerry
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:50.400]  You're credited with that
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:52.400]  You've got major intelligence connections
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:54.400]  And I mean, you don't shoot your mouth off
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:56.400]  So you're saying the word is
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:58.400]  Because that's what I'm getting from other high-level sources
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:00.400]  Is that the leader getting ready to flush
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:02.400]  Obama down the toilet
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:04.400]  He's damaged goods
[02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:06.400]  The phrase that I'm hearing is damaged goods
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:08.400]  And again, by the time I'm finished
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:10.400]  With this, you know, writing about Obama
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:12.400]  And getting after him
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:14.400]  The truth is
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:16.400]  American people do not know who this guy is
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:18.400]  In the White House
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:20.400]  As best you can tell, who is he?
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:22.400]  And now we know he isn't who he says he is
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:24.400]  Who is he?
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:26.400]  It's going to be a shock as to who the father is
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:28.400]  And I encourage everyone
[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:30.400]  You know, there's Joel Gilbert
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:32.400]  Who says Frank Marshall Davis is the father
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:34.400]  And his new DVD
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:36.400]  I want everybody to listen to Joel Gilbert
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.400]  Now, we're going to get him on
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:40.400]  The film isn't out until July, though
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:42.400]  We're going to get him on as soon as it comes out
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:44.400]  I've seen it
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:46.400]  It's a really solid...
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:48.400]  Frank Marshall Davis is candidate number one
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:50.400]  Two other candidates
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:52.400]  I'm not going to tell you who they are right now
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:54.400]  Two other candidates for the father
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:56.400]  It is not the African
[02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:58.400]  It is not the African
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:00.400]  And one more thing
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:02.400]  I want to just give you a question
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:04.400]  And then there's what would happen
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:06.400]  If the intelligence agencies
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:08.400]  Like Mossad
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:10.400]  And the successor agency
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:12.400]  To the KGB in Russia
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:14.400]  Just happened to have
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:16.400]  Whoever this guy, let's call him Barry Satoro
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:18.400]  Happened to have some of his DNA
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:20.400]  And let's say they happened to
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:22.400]  Have already determined
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:24.400]  That they had nothing to do
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:26.400]  With the African
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.400]  Barack Obama Sr.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:30.400]  And the mother did go to Kenya
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:32.400]  To have the birth, but she did it
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:34.400]  To perpetuate the cover-up
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:36.400]  Because what you've got here
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:38.400]  Is a case of identity creation
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:40.400]  From birth
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:42.400]  To conceal a deep secret the family
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:44.400]  Could not release
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:46.400]  The so-called father
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:48.400]  Of course, look at the color
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:50.400]  I've been to Kenya as you know
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:52.400]  Detained, the Luo tribe
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:54.400]  Are small and stature
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:56.400]  Very dark, round heads
[02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:58.400]  Slope foreheads
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:00.400]  Barack Obama Sr.
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:02.400]  The African looks nothing at all
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:04.400]  Like Barack Obama, the president
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:06.400]  Assumed identity
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.400]  We know he's got a fake social security number
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:10.400]  The proof for this
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:12.400]  Is now conclusive
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:14.400]  Is trying to validate
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:16.400]  That Obama's
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:18.400]  This is just a big con job
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:20.400]  And I can pretty much assure you
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:22.400]  There's going to be officials here
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:24.400]  In Hawaii at a very top level
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:26.400]  We're going to have to consider
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:28.400]  Getting defense attorneys
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:30.400]  And facing criminal prosecutions
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:32.400]  For the cover-up that's going on
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:34.400]  Right now today in Hawaii
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:36.400]  They better stop it
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:38.400]  Because law enforcement now
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:40.400]  Is taking a close look at it
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:42.400]  Representations
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:44.400]  Of birth when they know
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:46.400]  In the Hawaii Department of Health
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.400]  They can't prove Obama was born here
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:50.400]  The records in their file
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:52.400]  Don't say that
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:54.400]  This is unbelievable
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:56.400]  Because it all fits
[02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:58.400]  And it's insane
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:00.400]  And his publicist for 16 years
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:02.400]  Said he was born in Kenya
[02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:04.400]  Everybody in the media knows
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:06.400]  You provide that info to the publicist
[02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:08.400]  This is incredible
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:10.400]  Look
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:12.400]  If you take a look at what's also in that publicist statement
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:14.400]  They disclose there the name
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:16.400]  Of the company he worked at
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:18.400]  This business company
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:20.400]  Business systems company
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:22.400]  After Obama was at Columbia University
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:24.400]  That company is a well-known CIA front
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:26.400]  The mother
[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:28.400]  Ann Dunham
[02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:30.400]  Wasn't some anthropologist living poor
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:32.400]  She was in five-star hotels
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:34.400]  An employee of
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:36.400]  The Ford Foundation
[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:38.400]  Looking for Timothy Gates
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:40.400]  This is an above-government foundation could
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:42.400]  And we now identify
[02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:44.400]  Her apartment address is in New York City
[02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:46.400]  Hold on, stay there, but more coming up
[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:48.400]  I'm going to tell you about the new e-book
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:50.400]  He's got out as well
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:52.400]  We're on the march
[02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:54.400]  The Empire's on the run
[02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:56.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:02.400]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:04.400]  Control freaks adding poison to your water
[02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:06.400]  And laughing as you get sick and die
[02:30:06.400 --> 02:30:08.400]  Start purifying your water
[02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:10.400]  With ProPure
[02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:12.400]  My friends, I've done a lot of research

[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:16.400]  Bar none is ProPure

[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:22.400]  To prevent bacterial growth
[02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:24.400]  There's no priming required
[02:30:24.400 --> 02:30:26.400]  It's NSF42 certified
[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:28.400]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride
[02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:30.400]  Up to 95%
[02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:32.400]  Easy to set up and use
[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:34.400]  High water from lake streams, ponds and wells
[02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:36.400]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals
[02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:38.400]  Which is key
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:40.400]  Save money by not buying bottled water
[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:42.400]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic
[02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:44.400]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter
[02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:46.400]  Out there, it's what my family uses

[02:33:12.400 --> 02:33:14.400]  Ladies and gentlemen
[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:16.400]  I don't get up here and say
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:18.400]  Mary Sataro, aka Barack Obama
[02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:20.400]  Was born in Kenya
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:22.400]  To have some hyped up issue
[02:33:22.400 --> 02:33:24.400]  And I want to get up here and discredit him
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.400]  Because I hate his politics
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:28.400]  And neither does Dr. Corsi
[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:30.400]  He went after George Bush
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:32.400]  For NAFTA and GATT
[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:34.400]  And the North American Union
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:36.400]  He's pointing out Mitt Romney
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:38.400]  Bain Capital, Carbon Taxes
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:40.400]  Open Borders, Gun Control
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:42.400]  Road Obamacare
[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:44.400]  Quite frankly, Obama staying in
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:46.400]  And I've said this privately
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:48.400]  I've actually said it on air
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:50.400]  Well, worse is better
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:52.400]  Obama is better
[02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:54.400]  Obama is like five-week-old
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:56.400]  Garbage that nobody's taken out
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:58.400]  Romney is fresh, he's charming
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:00.400]  He's even, I mean, Obama
[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:02.400]  Early on now he's more negative
[02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:04.400]  Because he's a narcissist
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:06.400]  He can't stand the fact that people are onto him
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:08.400]  Excuse me
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:10.400]  Romney is very, very charming
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:12.400]  And comes off as very, very
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:14.400]  Likeable and is going to be very, very dangerous
[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:16.400]  As president
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:18.400]  And we got big trouble
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:20.400]  He's a globalist up one side and down the other
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:22.400]  He's changed his tune
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:24.400]  But he's going to go right along
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:26.400]  With the exact same programs
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:28.400]  Because the exact same globalist controlling
[02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:30.400]  And I'm starting to agree with Dr. Corsi
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:32.400]  And others, but he says he has the sources
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:34.400]  That the system is understanding
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:36.400]  Hey, if Obama's good for us
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:38.400]  To keep waking people up, that's not good
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:40.400]  For them, Dr. Corsi, please continue
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:42.400]  Well, I think the biggest problem
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.400]  That Obama's got
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:46.400]  Is that we're doing so much damage
[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:48.400]  To him now
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:50.400]  And who he is, his reputation
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:52.400]  He's basically
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:54.400]  A fictional character in the White House
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:56.400]  Obama may not make it
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:58.400]  In terms of credibility
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:00.400]  Even to the election
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:02.400]  They may have to replace Obama with another candidate
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:04.400]  The Democratic Party's going to take massive losses
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:06.400]  In 2012
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:08.400]  But they're beginning to realize this
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:10.400]  Obama has no chance of winning
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:12.400]  Even with 10%
[02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:14.400]  Vote fraud
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:16.400]  Democrats can't pull it off this time
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:18.400]  And now, you know
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:20.400]  I've been exposing the material on this
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:22.400]  HSBC bank fraud
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:24.400]  I've had the documents
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:26.400]  I've had 1,000 pages indicating
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:28.400]  Massive international money laundering
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:30.400]  I've been publishing it at WND
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:32.400]  Now I've connected
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:34.400]  I have the documents in my possession
[02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:36.400]  I've passed them on to the Sheriff
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:38.400]  Sheriff Arpaio, who is a true patriot
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:40.400]  They have this
[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:42.400]  What happens to me
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:44.400]  I've connected the bank fraud to Eric Holder
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:46.400]  Directly
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:48.400]  In the next 30 days
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:50.400]  I'm going to publish information that will show you
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:52.400]  Eric Holder
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:54.400]  And the chief of his terminal division
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:56.400]  At the center of a massive
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:35:58.400]  Banking fraud
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:00.400]  That has deprived millions of Americans
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:02.400]  Of their homes
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:04.400]  While the fat cats go free
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:06.400]  I've got to stop you right there
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:08.400]  Some of that has begun to come out
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:10.400]  More documents on it
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:12.400]  For those that don't know, this is the same crew
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:14.400]  That did Fast and Furious and all of this
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:16.400]  Of course, your main job after the State Department
[02:36:16.400 --> 02:36:18.400]  Was in high level bank regulation
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:20.400]  And investigating these things
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:22.400]  So that's your specialty
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:24.400]  Boy, this is some dangerous water we're in
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:26.400]  Give us as much as you can
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:28.400]  Give us as much as you can
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:30.400]  On record of what you've got on Holder
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:32.400]  In case they do try to kill you
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:34.400]  I will. I spent 25 years in bank marketing
[02:36:34.400 --> 02:36:36.400]  And I was working with regulators
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:38.400]  All over the world
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:40.400]  What I've got is a
[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:42.400]  Massive case
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:44.400]  Of fraud
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:46.400]  In mortgage backed securities
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:48.400]  Involving one of the biggest banks in the world
[02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:50.400]  Where prosecution was recommended
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:52.400]  By the
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:54.400]  Department of Justice
[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:56.400]  The IRS
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:58.400]  And every government
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:00.400]  Organization took a look at this
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:02.400]  Including Treasury
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:04.400]  And Eric Holder blocked the prosecution
[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:06.400]  For political reasons
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:08.400]  With the head of his criminal division
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:10.400]  I've got the files, I've got the documents
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:12.400]  I've got the court cases
[02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:14.400]  I've got all of the records
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:16.400]  And I'm going to start publishing that case
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:18.400]  With the next 30 days
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:20.400]  You're going to understand
[02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:22.400]  That the bank fraud is being conducted
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:24.400]  Out of the White House
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:26.400]  Through the approval of Eric Holder
[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:28.400]  Eric Holder is there to conduct bank fraud
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:30.400]  That's the whole purpose
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:32.400]  If anybody thinks that
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:34.400]  Why are we selling guns to the drug cartels?
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:36.400]  Sell them to ourselves
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:38.400]  That's the whole point
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:40.400]  People don't understand
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:42.400]  CIA and organized crime
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:44.400]  Aren't two entities
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:46.400]  Intelligence and organized criminals
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:48.400]  Work hand in hand
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:50.400]  Worldwide, they can't do it without banking
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:52.400]  I've got the proof
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:54.400]  To show that Eric Holder is making
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:56.400]  Political decisions to favor
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:58.400]  Those who fund Obama
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:38:00.400]  It's not cheap, you want protection from this
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:02.400]  Criminal White House
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:04.400]  Of Obama and Eric Holder
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:06.400]  You better be prepared to make millions
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:08.400]  In campaign contributions
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:10.400]  Now to be specific, if people are just joining us
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:12.400]  This actually came out a few months ago
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:14.400]  Part of it, and then of all places
[02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:16.400]  Two weeks ago
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:18.400]  It was reported on in Newsweek
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:20.400]  In their daily beast online
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:22.400]  That indeed Holder
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:24.400]  Has a law firm
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:26.400]  That if you then get representation from them
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:28.400]  You can steal billions
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:30.400]  To pay them millions
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:32.400]  So I know that's not cheap
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:34.400]  But it is cheap if you're getting millions
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:36.400]  But you're saying you've got even more now
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:38.400]  Yes, I've got a whole file on this
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:40.400]  Got absolute incontrovertible proof
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:42.400]  That Holder stopped
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:44.400]  For political reasons
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:46.400]  For campaign contributors
[02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:48.400]  To do them favors
[02:38:48.400 --> 02:38:50.400]  And the chief of his criminal division
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:52.400]  The gentleman knows his name
[02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:54.400]  Who I'm talking about
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:56.400]  We're going to come after you with the documents
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:58.400]  About the prosecution in which
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:00.400]  Millions of homeowners lost their homes
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:02.400]  And some of them being prosecuted
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:04.400]  Whereas the people who did the bank fraud
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:06.400]  Put together the fraudulent
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:08.400]  The fraudulent mortgage-backed securities
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:10.400]  Did the fraudulent appraisals
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:12.400]  Were let to walk free
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:14.400]  With Eric Holder
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:16.400]  And the head of the criminal division
[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:18.400]  Blocking the prosecutions
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:20.400]  Go back in research
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:22.400]  Look in Chicago
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:24.400]  When they wanted to have
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:26.400]  The casino gambling
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:28.400]  Donald Trump
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:30.400]  Now wants to build casinos in Chicago
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:32.400]  Another set of payoffs
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:34.400]  They're involved by the way
[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:36.400]  But at any rate, the guy who came
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:38.400]  Into Chicago to argue
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:40.400]  On behalf of Tony Rezco
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:42.400]  His criminal gang including Barack Obama
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:44.400]  Before Obama was president
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:46.400]  The Chicago ought to have this gambling
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:48.400]  Was Eric Holder
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:50.400]  On behalf of his Covington firm
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:52.400]  Eric Holder flew to Chicago
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:54.400]  To argue to put casino gambling
[02:39:54.400 --> 02:39:56.400]  In Chicago in a deal
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:58.400]  That Rezco was going to benefit from
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:00.400]  It's on the public record
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:02.400]  They're total mafia
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:04.400]  But the Republicans as you said
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:06.400]  Are involved in a lot of this as well
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:08.400]  And it seems like on every front now
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:10.400]  I've never seen such corruption
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:12.400]  Where the MF Global and all the regulators
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:14.400]  And JP Morgan and the missing Millions
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:16.400]  And now the top lobbyist for them
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:18.400]  Is over the committee
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:20.400]  That's going to investigate it
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:22.400]  That's out there as well
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:24.400]  Maybe they know something we don't know
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:26.400]  And they can just do whatever they want
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:28.400]  Look, I think that Barack Obama
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:30.400]  The globalists have decided to abandon Obama
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:32.400]  He's damaged goods
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:34.400]  He was truly
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:36.400]  Hating the United States, hating the Constitution
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:38.400]  He was extremely on the far left
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:40.400]  At least with Romney
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:42.400]  You get what I'm calling
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.400]  Another Republican party
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:46.400]  The centrist wing of the Democratic party
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:48.400]  There's one party
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:50.400]  And they trade it off
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:52.400]  Build a burger meeting to decide
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:54.400]  Who gets how many seats in the Senate
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:56.400]  Who gets how many seats in the House
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:58.400]  And the problem is
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:00.400]  Obama has so messed up
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:02.400]  The job that was given to him
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:04.400]  That in fact
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:06.400]  Now there may be no way
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:08.400]  The globalists are going to prevent the Democrats
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:10.400]  From taking massive losses
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:12.400]  Even in the governorships
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:14.400]  Democratic party is going to get crushed in November
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:16.400]  And even with massive voter fraud
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.400]  Which the Democrats are planning to do
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:20.400]  They won't save their jobs
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:22.400]  They're going down
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:24.400]  And that's the problem
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:26.400]  The information coming out
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:28.400]  In the next 30 days
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:30.400]  On Obama, who he is
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:32.400]  He's not who you think he is
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:34.400]  He is not the son
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:36.400]  Of the African government
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:38.400]  No kidding, if that is his dad
[02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:40.400]  I'll eat my hat
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:42.400]  And secondly
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:44.400]  You're going to be able to start seeing
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:46.400]  The administration
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:48.400]  To see the corruption
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:50.400]  The banking corruption
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:52.400]  Alex, I want to make it clear to people
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:54.400]  We do not have billions
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:56.400]  Hundreds of billions in dollars
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:58.400]  In drugs being conducted
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:00.400]  Worldwide
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:02.400]  Without the intelligence agencies
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:04.400]  And the government involved
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:06.400]  That money is going through the banking system
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:08.400]  Regulators are turning the other way
[02:42:08.400 --> 02:42:10.400]  Of course
[02:42:10.400 --> 02:42:12.400]  Off the books
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:14.400]  Billions of dollars in taxes
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:16.400]  Not being collected
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:18.400]  Because the banks are running the drug business
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:20.400]  On behalf of the government
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:22.400]  And in charge of it
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:24.400]  The CEO of the drug business
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:26.400]  In Mexico is Eric Holder
[02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:28.400]  You're right
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:30.400]  Let me segue into some other issues here
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:32.400]  They are announcing
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:34.400]  30,000 armed drones
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:36.400]  CBS News Salon
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:38.400]  Local police departments are getting
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:40.400]  Homeland security grants
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:42.400]  50 Cal's
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:44.400]  Rubber bullets
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:46.400]  Government is buying
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:48.400]  450 million rounds of hollow point
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:50.400]  40 Cal
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:52.400]  Hundreds of armored mobile pill boxes
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:54.400]  There's suddenly TSA checkpoints
[02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:56.400]  Everywhere on highways
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:58.400]  They're phasing in martial law
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:00.400]  Because the bankers know they're imploding things
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:02.400]  But look at Europe
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:04.400]  They meant to have this derivative
[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:06.400]  Implosion
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:08.400]  Bring in their new world order
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:10.400]  So overdone it
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:12.400]  And I'm getting a lot of information
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:14.400]  That the elite is not in control
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:16.400]  And that's why a lot of them are exiting
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:18.400]  To armored keeps
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:20.400]  In very remote areas
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:22.400]  Clearly this build up
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:24.400]  For martial law is taking place
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:26.400]  What is that about?
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:28.400]  Well, in fact
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:30.400]  That's the plan
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:32.400]  The original plan was to use this economic crisis
[02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:34.400]  To bring in more globalism
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:36.400]  More United Nations
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:38.400]  National Monetary Fund
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:40.400]  Well, that's so collapsed
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:42.400]  And in part because of exposing it
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:44.400]  You exposing it, Alex
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:46.400]  Me exposing it to others
[02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:48.400]  Showing the American people
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:50.400]  North American Union
[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:52.400]  Builder burger and all the things we've been trying
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:54.400]  Together to get the American people to be aware of
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:56.400]  Now, the next plan is
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:43:58.400]  Let's just go to martial law
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:00.400]  One of the only advantages I can think of
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:02.400]  At this point
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:04.400]  To get Obama gone in disgrace
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:06.400]  No one is ineligible
[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:08.400]  We can eliminate all of his executive orders
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:10.400]  And Obama signed a whole series
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:12.400]  Of executive orders
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:14.400]  That people don't realize
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:16.400]  Last was this one on the Treaty of the Seas
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:18.400]  Placing the United States under United Nations
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:20.400]  Control
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:22.400]  Absolutely, our rivers, our waterways
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:24.400]  And what do you think of Trent Lott
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:26.400]  Who fought it and called it world government
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:28.400]  Now's worshipping it
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:30.400]  Well, again, go to Washington
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:32.400]  Get bought off, that's the problem
[02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:34.400]  Also, look
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:36.400]  Even as people didn't realize it
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:38.400]  Remember 1070, the Arizona bill
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:40.400]  On immigration is in front of the Supreme Court
[02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:42.400]  Yes, but Obama
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:44.400]  Also submitted that to the world court
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:46.400]  Very quietly
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:48.400]  So if he doesn't like the result of the Supreme Court
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:50.400]  He can turn around and say the world court
[02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:52.400]  Trumps the Supreme Court
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:54.400]  Was that a big wake up call whenever
[02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:56.400]  He told Congress in a public letter
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:44:58.400]  In speeches that they have no power
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:00.400]  And the UN is his boss
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:02.400]  See, on Obama's mind
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:04.400]  He is not, I'm sure,
[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:06.400]  Ineligible to be president
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:08.400]  Because he's a citizen of the world
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:10.400]  And the United States is just a district of the United Nations
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:12.400]  He's just running
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:14.400]  A district of the United Nations
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:16.400]  He's not running a sovereign nation
[02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:18.400]  We've got to remind the American
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:20.400]  Government and the globalists
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:22.400]  That we the people are sovereign
[02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:24.400]  Do you agree with me that we're on a major offensive
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:26.400]  And having victory after victory right now
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:28.400]  And the system is saying, okay, we're spying on you
[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:30.400]  Okay, we've got drones, okay, we'll disappear you
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:32.400]  In an attempt to intimidate us
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:34.400]  Why am I working at this so desperately
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:36.400]  Right now, Alex
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:38.400]  Is because if
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:40.400]  Obama wins
[02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:42.400]  We do not have a First Amendment
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:44.400]  We won't have a Fourth Amendment
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:46.400]  We won't have a Bill of Rights
[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:48.400]  People like you and me will be in thought education camps
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:50.400]  If they allow us to live
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:52.400]  Our families will be destroyed
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:54.400]  Private property will be confiscated
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:56.400]  People think this is radical
[02:45:56.400 --> 02:45:58.400]  We are laid out and signed in executive
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:00.400]  Orders
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:02.400]  You've been pointing them out, I've been pointing them out
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:04.400]  They're right there in black and white
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:06.400]  Yeah, that's why I get mad when I see police with quotas
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:08.400]  Writing tickets for nothing
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:10.400]  They're told, oh, well, we're going bankrupt
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:12.400]  You could write a billion tickets that wouldn't pay it off
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:14.400]  Because we've signed on to the globalist fake debt
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:16.400]  The country is going down
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:18.400]  The reeducation camps
[02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:20.400]  The army admits they have
[02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:22.400]  And do you hear any of this in the mainstream news?
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:24.400]  No, and all of you that work for the mainstream media
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:26.400]  If you all start revolting
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:28.400]  They can't stop you all
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:30.400]  It's time for us to say enough of this
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:32.400]  Do we really want to go under a Stalinistic system?
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:34.400]  Because that's what they've got planned
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:36.400]  Yeah, and what they don't understand
[02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:38.400]  Of the Washington Post and the New York Times
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:40.400]  Is that when the globalists take over
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:42.400]  The useful idiots
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:44.400]  Which is what they call them
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:46.400]  Have always called them
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:48.400]  At the Washington Times
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:50.400]  Washington Post
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:52.400]  New York Times
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:54.400]  They go first
[02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:56.400]  They're the first ones they kill
[02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:58.400]  Because they don't
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:00.400]  Oh, let's really make the globalists happy
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:02.400]  Let's do partisan news
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:04.400]  And support Obama
[02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:06.400]  First black president
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:08.400]  Let's hype all that crap
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:10.400]  The truth is, those are the first guys
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:12.400]  When the New World Order takes over
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:14.400]  They eliminate
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:16.400]  Because they are too dangerous
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:18.400]  Too stupid
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:20.400]  Having promoted
[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:22.400]  This nonsense
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:24.400]  And Alex, it's coming down
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:26.400]  The greatest risk we've got here
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:28.400]  Is that the globalists may decide
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:30.400]  A last minute move
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:32.400]  And try a
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:34.400]  Crisis to prop up Obama
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:36.400]  Obama might just be really tired
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:38.400]  And he might have to just
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:40.400]  Really quit and have somebody else
[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:42.400]  Move in to be the candidate
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:44.400]  Because the globalists are going to realize
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:46.400]  I think this Bilderberger meeting
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:48.400]  Is when the unofficial
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:50.400]  Advancement is going to be made
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:52.400]  Is we are now in a post-Obama world
[02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:54.400]  Today, this is a post-Obama world
[02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:56.400]  Obama is in detail
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:47:58.400]  He's gone, the only question is how
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:00.400]  They're going to remove him
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:02.400]  And we're set to see thousands of people
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:04.400]  Protesting Bilderberger in Virginia
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:06.400]  I don't think they're going to be liking that
[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:08.400]  And what we're going to do, what I'm going to do
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:10.400]  Is I'm going to systematically now
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:12.400]  We're going to have a press conference
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:14.400]  I've handed over the research
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:16.400]  I watched what happened with Breitbart
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:18.400]  If anything happens to me
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:20.400]  The research I've got is not private
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:22.400]  Or secret anymore, it's in the hands
[02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:24.400]  Of the sheriff
[02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:26.400]  All the information I've talked today
[02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:28.400]  HSBC, I handed that
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:30.400]  First over to the sheriff
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:32.400]  The information that's coming out next
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:34.400]  On this next banking fraud
[02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:36.400]  And I'm just going to let you know
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:38.400]  It's going to be involving credit Swiss
[02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:40.400]  Wow, well this is just amazing
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:42.400]  Information, but to be clear here
[02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:44.400]  Because I've never heard you
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:46.400]  Be this quote extreme
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:48.400]  Well, the times are extreme
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:50.400]  All the documents, all the executive orders
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:52.400]  It's there, the system is
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:54.400]  The martial law grids been there for a while
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:56.400]  But they have got it
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:48:58.400]  At a thousand RPMs
[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:00.400]  They've got it leveraged up
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:02.400]  They're warming it up in the oven
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:04.400]  They're racing around like they're about to go operational
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:06.400]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:08.400]  A, B, how do we stop them from going operational?
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:10.400]  I've just spent a week here in Hawaii
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:12.400]  And I can confirm to you
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:14.400]  The cover-up has never been as intense
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:16.400]  The fix is in
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:18.400]  A non-verification, verification letter
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:20.400]  Sent by Hawaii
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:22.400]  To a
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:24.400]  Secretary of State, Ken Bennett
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:26.400]  In Arizona, who's all about
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:28.400]  What can be in the ballot
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:30.400]  But guess what?
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:32.400]  Ken Bennett's career is over
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:34.400]  He's another useful idiot
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:36.400]  He has to have a chance at the Republican Party
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:38.400]  He did what they wanted, that was his mistake
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:40.400]  They know he's an idiot
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.400]  He's always useful for a time
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:44.400]  He's gone, as soon as they take over
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:46.400]  And by the way
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:48.400]  The way to prevent them from taking over
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:50.400]  Alex, I'm going to publish
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:52.400]  When I'm going to publish
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:54.400]  I'll come back on the show
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:56.400]  If anything happens to me
[02:49:56.400 --> 02:49:58.400]  And you'll keep pressing the points
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:00.400]  They can't stand a light a day
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:02.400]  That's what destroys the global
[02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:04.400]  It's the truth
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:06.400]  They're on their heels now
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:08.400]  We're pushing them back, we can win this thing
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:10.400]  We can win it
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:12.400]  We have to win it
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:14.400]  If we don't win it
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:16.400]  Like Abraham Lincoln said, the last great hope of mankind
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:18.400]  Is gone
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:20.400]  Our founding fathers did not create this country
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:22.400]  To see
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:24.400]  The American people throw it away
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:26.400]  For a sexual agenda
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:28.400]  What about false flags?
[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:30.400]  Are you worried about a false flag or a war?
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.400]  That's as I said
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:34.400]  One or two things are going to contemplate
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:36.400]  I'm sure at Bilderberger
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:38.400]  A false flag, a war
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:40.400]  Some crisis to prop Barack Obama
[02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:42.400]  Not to make him win
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:44.400]  Just to make him last until the election
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:46.400]  That's the crisis they have to solve
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:48.400]  On our global level
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:50.400]  Alright, tell us about the new e-book
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:52.400]  Tell us about the new e-book
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:54.400]  It's called Saul Linsky
[02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:56.400]  The Evil Genius Behind Obama
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:50:58.400]  E-book
[02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:00.400]  Alright, thank you so much
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:02.400]  We'll talk to you soon
[02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:04.400]  Thanks Alex
[02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:06.400]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:08.400]  To get the lights back on?
[02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:10.400]  If so, this is going to be the most important
[02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:12.400]  Message you'll ever hear
[02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:14.400]  Because there's never been a better time
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:16.400]  To get ready for the winter power outages ahead
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:18.400]  Here's why
[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:20.400]  Solar power generators are now available
[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:22.400]  From our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:24.400]  One of our oldest sponsors
[02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:26.400]  Their emergency backup systems provide
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:28.400]  Life-saving electrical power when you need it most
[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:30.400]  Unlike gas generators
[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:32.400]  A solar generator runs quietly
[02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:34.400]  And produces electricity from the sun
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:36.400]  It's like having an electric power plant
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:38.400]  Running quietly in your own own
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:40.400]  Whether it's ice storms, brownouts or blackouts
[02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:42.400]  You'll never have to suffer through
[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:44.400]  Painful power outages again
[02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:46.400]  When the power goes out this winter
[02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:48.400]  You'll be ready with a solar power generator
[02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:50.400]  From Solutions from Science

[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:58.400]  To cleanse and remove toxins

[02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:19.400]  One world way is processed in a unique manner
[02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:21.400]  To protect the amino acids so they're easy to digest
[02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:23.400]  And use at the cellular level
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:25.400]  The health benefits of undamaged weight protein
[02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:27.400]  Are well documented, they are healing
[02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:29.400]  Reduced inflammation, increased levels of glutathione

[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:26.400]  Mayor Bloomberg is coming out and saying
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:29.400]  The feds should quote force local areas
[02:54:29.400 --> 02:54:32.400]  Because they're God to take massive influxes
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:34.400]  Of illegal aliens making him legal
[02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:36.400]  And reseed US cities
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:38.400]  That that will fix our problems
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:40.400]  Yes, they instantly go on welfare
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:42.400]  And then things bankrupt faster
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:44.400]  And the answer is even more foreigners
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.400]  I guess to be the army
[02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:48.400]  Here in the US against the American people
[02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:50.400]  But it doesn't matter, we're waking up those
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:52.400]  Foreigners as well
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:54.400]  They are waking up
[02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:56.400]  Because everything the globalists push
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:00.400]  Everything they stand for is bad news, period
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:04.400]  Here's a new study
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:07.400]  Out of the Ottawa citizen, this is so horrible
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:09.400]  On every flu shot we've ever seen
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:12.400]  On the insert, it says don't give it to pregnant women
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:14.400]  Don't give pregnant women vaccines, period
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:17.400]  Because it causes autoimmune problems and kill the baby
[02:55:17.400 --> 02:55:20.400]  And can cause all sorts of degenerative problems in the child
[02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:22.400]  Pregnant women, flu shots
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.400]  May be beneficial to baby study shows
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:26.400]  And these companies pay for these
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:30.400]  And they say pregnant women, you need the flu shot especially
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:32.400]  This is so sick
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:34.400]  I've had so many medical doctors on
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:36.400]  It was known until about four years ago
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:39.400]  That you don't ever give a pregnant woman a shot
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:41.400]  And these flu shots, oh that's so evil
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:44.400]  That poor mama there on the photo
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.400]  Holding her belly, all happy
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.400]  She's got a baby coming, she trusts the system
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:50.400]  And she has no idea
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:52.400]  These useful idiots, it's so sad
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:55.400]  She might as well be walking into machine gun fire right there
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:00.400]  Oh man, that's so evil
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:02.400]  We've got to reach these women, we've got to warn them
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:04.400]  Pregnancy is no time for women to refuse a flu shot
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:07.400]  Since it may bring unexpected benefits to their babies
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:08.400]  Before they're even born
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:11.400]  There's a new study that analyzed vaccination rates during the
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:14.400]  2009 H1N1 pandemic
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:17.400]  Yeah, they also say mercury's good for your child's brain
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:19.400]  In some studies
[02:56:19.400 --> 02:56:21.400]  I've played those clips here
[02:56:21.400 --> 02:56:23.400]  If you're a new listener, I'm not joking
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:25.400]  Go to YouTube, type in
[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:27.400]  New says mercury good for children's brains
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:29.400]  Indeed evidence is growing based on findings of the study
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:31.400]  And a few others
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:33.400]  That the flu vaccines are safe and effective
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:35.400]  Not only for expected mothers but also for unborn infants
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:37.400]  Oh, wow
[02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:40.400]  The government says they want to kill babies up to age three
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.400]  But there's too many of us
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.400]  But hey, take a shot, Bill Gates loves you
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:46.400]  All these groups stand to benefit
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.400]  Most flu vaccines, little research has been conducted
[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:50.400]  On how they respond to them
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:53.400]  Research says the latest findings could help debunk
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:55.400]  Persistent myths about the flu shot
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:57.400]  And its effects on pregnant women
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:56:59.400]  Like making the baby die
[02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:02.400]  A vast majority of women remain reluctant to get it
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:04.400]  They found this lady
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:06.400]  That says the most important thing about the study was
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.400]  The flu vaccine did no harm to fetuses
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:10.400]  Said Dr. Mart Walker, an obstetrician
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:13.400]  The Ottawa hospital and the study's co-author
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:16.400]  Oh, you're the study's co-author
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:18.400]  Of the vaccine companies
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.400]  Well, that's what I understand then
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:22.400]  Not only was the vaccine safe
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:24.400]  There was a potential benefit
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:26.400]  Well, there you go folks, a mercury filled shot
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:28.400]  When most of these vaccines
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:31.400]  Will almost all of them carrying other cancer viruses
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:33.400]  I mean, you can look up the H1N1
[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:35.400]  It said had rogue viruses
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:37.400]  There's nothing rogue about it
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:39.400]  They released the H1N1 a year before as a simulant
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:41.400]  I can't believe how incredibly accurate our guests were
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:44.400]  Just stunning news broken years
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:47.400]  Before it came out here during that whole staged event
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:49.400]  Hey, you know what though?
[02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:51.400]  They've had a massive exodus
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:53.400]  Out of colleges around the country
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:55.400]  Now they're trying to tell people it's mandatory
[02:57:55.400 --> 02:57:57.400]  They got signs up everywhere saying it's mandatory
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:57:59.400]  The college is here in Austin
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:01.400]  And people are just saying, you know what, I'm done
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:03.400]  I'm not taking it because they lied to them
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:05.400]  And tell them that you have to
[02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:07.400]  And 40 billion a year being lost because of the TSA
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:09.400]  And it's just going to get worse
[02:58:09.400 --> 02:58:11.400]  All news flashing murderers
[02:58:11.400 --> 02:58:13.400]  Yeah, you may think it's funny to sit there
[02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:16.400]  And kill us and to, you know, to go to the mall
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:18.400]  And see a third of the kids drooling
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:21.400]  But I don't think it's funny and I hate your guts
[02:58:21.400 --> 02:58:24.400]  And I will never stop
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:26.400]  If you had me on the rack torturing me to death
[02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:28.400]  I would spit my last breath out at you
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:30.400]  You understand that?
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:31.400]  You will be defeated
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:33.400]  I can see it, I know it
[02:58:33.400 --> 02:58:35.400]  And I'm owning it
[02:58:35.400 --> 02:58:37.400]  And so is everybody else
[02:58:37.400 --> 02:58:40.400]  1776
