[00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:25.647]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:44.679]  Okay, the big story right now here in the United States that's got everybody on the edge of their seat is the fact that the New York Post on Sunday reported that Hillary, according to their sources in New York, is eyeing running for president in 2020.
[00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.400]  And my response to that is, of course she is.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.821]  Regardless, she's going to want to raise the campaign money and then swindle it like she always does.
[00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:55.462]  I mean, she violates every law under the sun.
[00:00:56.596 --> 00:01:01.600]  But it's Joel Gilbert who first reported it on Friday at American Thinker.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.603]  So we're posting the article on Infowars.com right now.
[00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:13.029]  It's a lengthy, detailed, 10-page report that you really need to read.
[00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:18.633]  We're going to be covering it with Joel Gilbert coming up at the bottom of this hour.
[00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:32.544]  That said, I made some phone calls yesterday, and then I made some more phone calls this morning to some really smart folks in D.C.
[00:01:32.544 --> 00:01:39.468]  who are, let's just say, very close to Hillary's law firm.
[00:01:39.468 --> 00:01:48.315]  And I did some checking around, and I was told exactly what Joel Gilbert wrote from them.
[00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:53.940]  Because, you know, they think they have moles, we have moles as well.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:05.189]  But I was told it's so she can try to maintain control over the party, and that her and Obama are working together, but that they are still fighting with each other over the reins of control.
[00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:12.195]  So they're unified in their attempt to block Trump's agenda, to take Trump out, to stop the Make America Great Again agenda, but that
[00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:17.348]  At the very top, and they're still struggling over the reins of power in the party.
[00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:31.495]  And so if she doesn't try to stay in the reins and tell her people, and she's still got a big cult behind her, that she's not running, then their power will completely dissipate.
[00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:36.577]  Already, contributions to their foundation are down by 80 plus percent.
[00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:39.479]  She's not in government anymore for paper play.
[00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.901]  But now they're doing the stunts like Bernie Sanders flying around
[00:02:43.874 --> 00:02:45.816]  Commercial.
[00:02:45.816 --> 00:02:52.461]  Sanders would go one stunt further and Sanders would fly and coach.
[00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:56.744]  Of course, the word is he doesn't really do that unless it's election time.
[00:02:56.744 --> 00:03:05.171]  But there's the Clintons that own a bunch of jet aircraft and have stolen millions of dollars and are just unbelievably corrupt and get paid millions of dollars per speech.
[00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:05.751]  There they are.
[00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:10.155]  Hillary keeps distance from deplorables as she flies commercial.
[00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:12.015]  There you go.
[00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:17.479]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.902]  We're going to be looking at it, but is she really running?
[00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:23.924]  Yes, she is currently.
[00:03:23.924 --> 00:03:29.288]  We're only a year and a half out from the middle of the election.
[00:03:29.288 --> 00:03:32.551]  We're only less than two and a half years out from the actual election.
[00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:36.304]  The 2020 election is already going on.
[00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:39.266]  That's why Trump announced months ago it was genius.
[00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:42.588]  Because the Democrats are already campaigning against him.
[00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:47.231]  So the best way for him to get out in front of them is to get out in front of them.
[00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.672]  That's why you do that.
[00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:57.558]  But she is just arrogant and just crazy enough to actually go through with it all if she can try to stay alive.
[00:03:57.558 --> 00:04:03.662]  But as we all know, she's had more surgeries and more health problems than Darth Vader.
[00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:14.917]  And so they call them gomers, people that have had a lot of cancer, a lot of heart problems, a lot of other things, but that are really hard to kill.
[00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:18.199]  So they have a lot of health problems, but they're still alive.
[00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.562]  And Hillary Clinton is a gomer.
[00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:24.964]  She's got to walk around with back braces.
[00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:28.426]  She's got to wear the glasses for the seizures.
[00:04:28.426 --> 00:04:30.807]  She has been caught on tape having the seizures.
[00:04:30.807 --> 00:04:33.930]  She's constantly falling down.
[00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.410]  She's got
[00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.990]  Vertigo.
[00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.094]  I mean, it's a hellish life, but she's trying to cling to power.
[00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:45.897]  Like herpes, trying to stay alive on a toilet seat.
[00:04:45.897 --> 00:04:50.179]  Hoping somebody sits down on it so it can be transferred onto them.
[00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:52.661]  So this is big exclusive intel you're gonna get.
[00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:54.422]  Coming up, we're gonna lay it all out.
[00:04:54.422 --> 00:04:55.342]  Hillary's in for 2020.
[00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.355]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:07.659]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:13.928]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:05:13.928 --> 00:05:16.691]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:05:17.432 --> 00:05:21.253]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:05:21.253 --> 00:05:27.715]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:05:27.715 --> 00:05:32.677]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.352]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:05:37.352 --> 00:05:44.555]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:05:44.555 --> 00:05:49.777]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:05:49.777 --> 00:05:55.459]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:59.441]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:14.782]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:36.826]  It's Monday, the ninth day of July 2018.
[00:06:36.826 --> 00:06:38.727]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:38.727 --> 00:06:41.247]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:41.247 --> 00:06:58.871]  Joe Gilbert, who broke the big story at AmericanThinker.com on Friday that the New York Post then picked up, that is now one of the top stories in the world, that Hillary Clinton is eyeing a run for the 2020 presidential nomination.
[00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:00.391]  And she's going to attempt to unseat 45.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.103]  Unbelievable.
[00:07:06.103 --> 00:07:13.932]  I made some phone calls to a lot of sources yesterday and today about this, and they said absolutely.
[00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:16.996]  And they broke down why, and I concurred with their analysis.
[00:07:16.996 --> 00:07:22.903]  But then I made some phone calls to some sources and basically bluffed them
[00:07:25.438 --> 00:07:34.305]  With a police tactic, where you just say, well, I know that she's told you and they've said this, so keep your infrastructure in place, even though everybody's pay's been cut way back.
[00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:42.211]  I know the foundation hasn't been making as much money, but I engaged a few individuals talking about, you know, how did she think she could win?
[00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:43.513]  This is crazy.
[00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:48.897]  And they just bluffed right into it.
[00:07:48.897 --> 00:07:50.398]  Unbelievable.
[00:07:50.398 --> 00:07:54.942]  So Democrats that I've called, that are close to Hillary,
[00:07:56.072 --> 00:08:00.635]  That through my channels I've been able to talk to off and on over the years.
[00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:14.643]  They have been told since she lost about a week after that they were going to regroup and they were at least going to get the campaign money and they were going to control the Democratic Party process by her announcing her run early.
[00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:27.552]  Then trying to control the party and then trying to pick someone that they would then hand the ball off to if her health goes down too much, which they think is a real possibility, obviously.
[00:08:27.552 --> 00:08:32.675]  But that's how they will maintain control of the party.
[00:08:32.675 --> 00:08:33.676]  And what Joel Gilbert
[00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:40.834]  He lays out the American Thinker article that we've reposted to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:53.763]  What he lays out dovetails with what all my sources are saying because Hillary Clinton's evil may only be outstretched and outpaced by her arrogance.
[00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:55.104]  She wears a back brace.
[00:08:55.104 --> 00:08:56.125]  She has seizures.
[00:08:56.125 --> 00:08:59.987]  She had a brain tumor removed in 2013.
[00:08:59.987 --> 00:09:02.249]  She looks visibly extremely frail.
[00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:14.536]  But she still reportedly works up to 16 hours a day trying to control her criminal network.
[00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:18.980]  She is truly a monstrous witch.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:26.467]  But she's got her network in place.
[00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:27.348]  They are in a cult.
[00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:30.794]  They believe she's a god.
[00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:32.255]  They believe in the demographics.
[00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:37.397]  They can turn women against Trump and have them vote for her simply because she's a woman.
[00:09:37.397 --> 00:09:44.880]  Most importantly, they're not going to turn loose of the Democratic Party infrastructure and money.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.561]  Especially after their foundation is 75 to 80 plus percent down.
[00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:47.621]  So,
[00:09:58.038 --> 00:10:01.740]  She doesn't just act evil.
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.101]  She doesn't just look evil.
[00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:06.423]  She behaves in a very, very wicked, destructive manner.
[00:10:06.423 --> 00:10:13.547]  Whatever she touches turns to absolute crud.
[00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:25.954]  And the fact that she thinks that she can win again, or that she can even live that long, is a sterling example
[00:10:27.532 --> 00:10:34.838]  Of how arrogance and false confidence seems to go hand in hand with manifest evil.
[00:10:34.838 --> 00:10:39.061]  By the way, you look at Bill Clinton, I mean, the expiration date is up on that guy.
[00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:42.884]  It's like you leave a carton of milk in the refrigerator at the back, you forget about it.
[00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:45.406]  It's a C3 plastic container.
[00:10:45.406 --> 00:10:49.649]  You see it all clotted up at the top, you go, oh, that must be old milk, I forgot about it.
[00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.851]  You don't even need to look at the expiration date.
[00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.952]  But you still do, and you go, oh, this has been bad for two weeks.
[00:10:54.878 --> 00:11:00.522]  You go over and throw it in the trash can, or you dump it down the sink.
[00:11:00.522 --> 00:11:08.388]  And you look at Bill Clinton, you look at Hillary, I mean, they are milk cartons that have, like, green floating at the top.
[00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:16.134]  And they've been in the refrigerator so long that the whole plastic carton has gas pressure in it from the rotting milk, and it's all bloated and about to pop.
[00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:19.558]  But it's perfect!
[00:11:19.558 --> 00:11:22.420]  They look like Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.904]  They act like Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars.
[00:11:26.904 --> 00:11:32.648]  And they're saying, no, we're going to hold on to power forever.
[00:11:32.648 --> 00:11:37.612]  Oh, but they're flying coach now.
[00:11:37.612 --> 00:11:38.793]  Isn't it just darling?
[00:11:38.793 --> 00:11:40.434]  Isn't it just special?
[00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:41.375]  Isn't it just cute?
[00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:44.938]  Now, we're going to look more at this with Joel Gilbert when he joins us in about 15 minutes.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:12:13.099]  When we come back, I have talked to not just Roger Stone, that has a lot of high-level sources, but I've talked to folks in the campaign, and I've talked to one of our sources in the White House, three sources today, and they have narrowed it down to the two people that they last were told, and one of them was told yesterday, that Trump is leaning towards, but up to the minute,
[00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:27.232]  Trump is looking at all the data, all the information, he's calling Congress, he's getting their take on who can get confirmed, and who is the most original, constructionist, constitutionalist.
[00:12:27.232 --> 00:12:32.975]  And so we'll look at the individuals that are in the lead.
[00:12:32.975 --> 00:12:39.859]  But Kavanaugh was in the front of the lead until Trump learned, because he does have a decent voting record as a judge,
[00:12:41.633 --> 00:12:49.498]  But the connections to the Bushes and the connections to Karl Rove, I've been told that he is not going to be picked.
[00:12:49.498 --> 00:12:53.401]  The President's currently decided he's out of the running.
[00:12:53.401 --> 00:12:55.322]  But I have the three names of who's in the running.
[00:12:55.322 --> 00:12:59.765]  You'll say, well Alex, you're right most of the time, but you said that it was going to be Napolitano.
[00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:02.467]  Trump told Napolitano, you'll be my second choice.
[00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:12.079]  But then reportedly some conversations happened and now it's Attorney General that he's being eyed for because of the fact that he's not too old.
[00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:16.581]  It's just that we want to get somebody in there who can serve 30 years.
[00:13:16.581 --> 00:13:20.823]  But Napolitano, maybe 10, 15, you know, he's an older guy, still really sharp.
[00:13:20.823 --> 00:13:28.507]  And so it's more of a job for the Attorney General spot.
[00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:31.608]  So we're gonna be looking at that and going over some of those names
[00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:52.997]  When we come back from this break, we've got to end this special today or tomorrow because we're running low on a lot of the things that we're discounting 50% and plus the Fourth of July week is over, but the Second American Revolution sale is what I'm calling it and it's extended until tomorrow when we have new specials that will be launched on Wednesday.
[00:13:55.282 --> 00:13:56.663]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:13:56.663 --> 00:14:03.988]  When you go buy books, videos, t-shirts, water filtration, air filtration, whatever the best systems are, we get them and we discount them and we sell them.
[00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:05.989]  And our supplements are the same as well.
[00:14:05.989 --> 00:14:07.810]  We have free shipping on U.S.
[00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:08.630]  domestic.
[00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.492]  Can't do it international.
[00:14:10.492 --> 00:14:11.452]  And 50% off.
[00:14:11.452 --> 00:14:15.595]  And when you say 50% off, we don't raise the price and then say 50% off.
[00:14:15.595 --> 00:14:16.756]  It's 50% off.
[00:14:16.756 --> 00:14:21.979]  Many of these, like the colloidal silver, silver bullet, and
[00:14:24.099 --> 00:14:26.930]  Knockout and products like
[00:14:28.191 --> 00:14:35.454]  Supermill Vitality and products like Brain Force are very close to losing money when I show them at these prices.
[00:14:35.454 --> 00:14:38.836]  But I want new people who haven't tried it to try it and see how great it is.
[00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:42.617]  But I also know when people come in to get these lost liters, they buy other products.
[00:14:42.617 --> 00:14:49.981]  But just check out the t-shirts while you're in there because it sent shockwaves across the country to the globalists when Hillary for Prison shirts went out.
[00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:52.442]  A hundred plus thousand of them.
[00:14:52.442 --> 00:14:54.603]  Now granted, most of them we sold for five dollars.
[00:14:55.984 --> 00:14:58.626]  We sold maybe $10,000 at full price.
[00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:03.170]  We sold the rest between $5 and $10, depending on what sales we had.
[00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.872]  I can't afford to do that.
[00:15:04.872 --> 00:15:09.296]  Because a lot of our shirts are made in America and printed.
[00:15:09.296 --> 00:15:10.097]  So they're costing us $10.
[00:15:10.097 --> 00:15:14.581]  We have a whole section that isn't made in America, but still printed here.
[00:15:15.765 --> 00:15:23.168]  And a lot of you choose to get that, and I understand why, because I can sell you that for $9.95 and make $5, but I've got to sell the Made in America for $9.95 to make $10.
[00:15:23.168 --> 00:15:29.811]  So, fund the Infowars, spread the First Amendment, take photos wearing the shirts.
[00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:35.093]  I love the new Reelect 45, because Walmart had the one saying Impeach 45, but we just changed it.
[00:15:35.093 --> 00:15:38.435]  Same basic design to Reelect 45.
[00:15:40.696 --> 00:15:44.698]  45 the American flag at Infowars.com and on the back it says I am the resistance.
[00:15:44.698 --> 00:15:45.278]  That means you.
[00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:45.778]  They're wearing it.
[00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:49.640]  Then we have mean like a Wolverine shirt with Trump on it.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.180]  It's red.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.121]  It's awesome.

[00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:22.123]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:22.123 --> 00:20:26.765]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[00:20:26.765 --> 00:20:30.187]  I work for 95, hell I pay the price.
[00:20:30.187 --> 00:20:34.809]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[00:20:34.809 --> 00:20:36.310]  But why do I always feel
[00:20:52.731 --> 00:20:58.815]  Alright, the President at this point, according to high-level multiple sources, has not decided yet.
[00:20:58.815 --> 00:21:16.205]  At 9 o'clock Eastern, 8 o'clock Central, we'll be covering it live here tonight with special extended InfoWars Nightly News coverage of that because it is so critical and will deal such a major death blow if Trump can get a real conservative or constitutionalist or even libertarian confirmed on the court.
[00:21:16.205 --> 00:21:17.306]  It will be a big blow.
[00:21:17.306 --> 00:21:19.707]  It will demoralize the enemy.
[00:21:19.707 --> 00:21:21.869]  They're also obviously going to try to
[00:21:23.433 --> 00:21:33.615]  Go in and block the nomination Al Gore, Rob Reiner, Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore.
[00:21:33.615 --> 00:21:37.176]  They've all called for uprisings, insurrection to block it.
[00:21:37.176 --> 00:21:45.058]  When we point out that they're calling for civil war and that USA Today says we're in a civil war, I say we'll mark this July 4th then on
[00:21:47.597 --> 00:22:00.502]  America standing up to these people and politically knowing we're in an information war and they see it as a physical war and I think you can mark July 4th 2018 as the kickoff of the new civil war.
[00:22:00.502 --> 00:22:12.866]  Doesn't mean it means North versus South or the cavalry lining up to kill each other but political scientists agree it is a civil war going from a cold civil war to a soft civil war to a hot civil war.
[00:22:14.502 --> 00:22:23.828]  And they play semantical games in thousands of newspapers since last week, saying, Jones says that there will be total death on July 4th and shooting and killing everywhere.
[00:22:23.828 --> 00:22:40.477]  No, just conservatives and libertarians and Christians and others being attacked and being drugged by vehicles and being shot and being stabbed and being thrown out of businesses and being denied service and having their ribs broken and on and on and on.
[00:22:40.477 --> 00:22:41.578]  The things you've been doing.
[00:22:45.768 --> 00:23:00.513]  Now, let's play a clip here of the President earlier this morning saying that he does want to let everybody know that he will be announcing who the new Supreme Court Justice will be tonight.
[00:23:00.513 --> 00:23:05.994]  He'll make his decision, obviously in the next few hours, and then get them ready to be there.
[00:23:05.994 --> 00:23:07.955]  But he hasn't made up his mind yet.
[00:23:07.955 --> 00:23:08.275]  Here it is.
[00:23:11.463 --> 00:23:15.205]  I'm getting very close to making a final decision.
[00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:19.487]  And I believe this person will do a great job.
[00:23:19.487 --> 00:23:21.628]  But I'm very close to making a decision.
[00:23:21.628 --> 00:23:24.209]  Have not made it official yet, obviously.
[00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:25.190]  Have not made it final.
[00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.650]  But let's say it's the four people.
[00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.371]  But they're excellent, everyone.
[00:23:28.371 --> 00:23:30.252]  You can't go wrong.
[00:23:30.252 --> 00:23:38.556]  Because it will cement a conservative majority... Now, let's go over
[00:23:39.932 --> 00:23:46.354]  Who, I have been told, currently is at the head of the line.
[00:23:46.354 --> 00:23:49.115]  Judge Amy Barrett.
[00:23:49.115 --> 00:23:57.117]  Trump really likes her, but they're concerned she might not get confirmed, because she's too, quote, Christian, and too conservative, and too constructionist.
[00:23:57.117 --> 00:23:59.858]  I think she would make a really good choice.
[00:23:59.858 --> 00:24:02.359]  That's who I would like to see.
[00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:07.741]  Good looking, smart, conservative, classical Catholic woman, a good person,
[00:24:10.387 --> 00:24:14.811]  To replace Kennedy.
[00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:20.637]  And it would really knock down all this stupid Hillary stuff about, we don't want women in positions of power.
[00:24:20.637 --> 00:24:23.320]  The optics are great too, plus she's really young.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.042]  She could be on the court 35, 40 years.
[00:24:26.042 --> 00:24:27.664]  That's a big bonus.
[00:24:27.664 --> 00:24:32.428]  But she is third in the running right now.
[00:24:32.428 --> 00:24:33.810]  You're seeing in the news that
[00:24:36.018 --> 00:24:41.640]  Thomas Hardiman is in the lead, according to Breitbart.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.680]  Barrett and Hardiman are in the lead.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:51.862]  That is not what I'm told from my high-level campaign sources, high-level White House sources, and Roger Stone has sources as well.
[00:24:51.862 --> 00:24:53.243]  That is not who I'm told is in the lead.
[00:24:53.243 --> 00:24:55.483]  She's in the number three position.
[00:24:55.483 --> 00:24:59.084]  Hardiman is in the number four position.
[00:24:59.084 --> 00:25:02.465]  Senator Lee is in the running still.
[00:25:02.465 --> 00:25:04.026]  Kavanaugh is out.
[00:25:04.026 --> 00:25:05.086]  That's the big takeaway.
[00:25:06.226 --> 00:25:32.052]  Currently, Kavanaugh, because of his Bush connections, and because of his neocon connections, and because of his never-Trumper connections, Brett Kavanaugh, the minion, reportedly, of Karl Rove, not a big plus as well, he was in the running and was put forward to the President up front, but that is not the case.
[00:25:32.052 --> 00:25:33.292]  Raymond Cattledge,
[00:25:35.672 --> 00:25:37.433]  is right up at the top.
[00:25:37.433 --> 00:25:44.839]  Raymond Cathledge is right up there at the top.
[00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:57.729]  So, Cathledge, Amy Barrett, and then one other as well that I'll go back to here in just a moment, but first,
[00:25:59.389 --> 00:26:04.273]  Let's play one reason I'd really like to see Amy Barrett in there.
[00:26:04.273 --> 00:26:11.338]  Remember when Dianne Feinstein started channeling the Jedi Council Master Yoda?
[00:26:11.338 --> 00:26:14.561]  And said, the dogma is strong in you.
[00:26:14.561 --> 00:26:17.423]  The force is strong with you.
[00:26:17.423 --> 00:26:21.406]  Join me and I will complete your training.
[00:26:21.406 --> 00:26:24.188]  The Emperor has foreseen this.
[00:26:24.188 --> 00:26:26.650]  No, I am your father.
[00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:30.519]  Don't act so surprised, Hillary.
[00:26:30.519 --> 00:26:33.480]  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.821]  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
[00:26:38.821 --> 00:26:52.244]  So, here she is, channeling Master Yoda, saying the Christian dogma... Christian dogma strong in this one is... Here she is.
[00:26:52.244 --> 00:26:57.745]  When you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws
[00:26:59.054 --> 00:27:05.437]  is that the dogma lives loudly within you.
[00:27:05.437 --> 00:27:16.683]  And that's of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for for years in this country.
[00:27:16.683 --> 00:27:20.665]  By the way, I've got all my notes here.
[00:27:20.665 --> 00:27:23.066]  It's not Cathledge, it's Keithledge.
[00:27:23.066 --> 00:27:25.227]  You can say it, Cathledge, Keithledge.
[00:27:25.227 --> 00:27:28.349]  Again, I'm going to go over more of this
[00:27:31.545 --> 00:27:32.886]  As things continue to unfold.
[00:27:32.886 --> 00:27:42.212]  But some sources are saying Hardiman is in the lead and that Kavanaugh is down because of his anti-Trump connections.
[00:27:42.212 --> 00:27:46.815]  And that's pretty much unanimous.
[00:27:46.815 --> 00:27:51.458]  But a lot of folks, like I said, are rooting for Barrett because of what you just saw.
[00:27:51.458 --> 00:27:58.242]  But we're all going to find out this evening.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.962]  No mistake about that, so I'm extremely excited about it.
[00:28:04.962 --> 00:28:10.204]  But let's hear that bizarre Dianne Feinstein clip one more time.
[00:28:10.204 --> 00:28:22.990]  Imagine if you said to someone like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who's Jewish, your Jewish faith is strong in you.
[00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:26.491]  The dogma of Jews is strong in you.
[00:28:26.491 --> 00:28:29.893]  You would see that senator removed from office because of the bigoted
[00:28:35.162 --> 00:28:50.831]  We'll come back with more of that on the other side, and we will also break down the fact that Hillary is intending to run for 2020, and the man that first broke it last Friday is going to be joining us with the inside intel and more.

[00:29:31.601 --> 00:29:33.323]  My name is Kevin Schipp.
[00:29:33.323 --> 00:29:36.025]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:29:36.025 --> 00:29:41.350]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:47.035]  We're in a constitutional crisis, and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:50.478]  We gotta get this out, because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[00:29:50.478 --> 00:29:53.581]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.

[00:33:20.257 --> 00:33:26.287]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:44.852]  We are back live.
[00:33:44.852 --> 00:33:52.060]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, the ninth day of July 2018.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:59.728]  And as is so often the case, real investigative journalists first report on what's happening and then mainstream media picks it up later.
[00:34:02.521 --> 00:34:10.307]  No stranger to breaking big news stories, investigative journalist, documentary filmmaker, Joel Gilbert, wrote a detailed article that I'm actually jealous of.
[00:34:10.307 --> 00:34:15.191]  I wish you'd have sent it to Infowars.com for AmericanThinker.com.
[00:34:15.191 --> 00:34:19.375]  And I started making phone calls yesterday saying, is this really the case?
[00:34:19.375 --> 00:34:24.999]  There's some high-level sources, both Democrat and Republican, and they said, absolutely.
[00:34:24.999 --> 00:34:26.921]  And then they laid out why.
[00:34:26.921 --> 00:34:28.682]  And Gilbert lays a lot of it out in his article.
[00:34:30.408 --> 00:34:44.663]  The big issue here is that Hillary Clinton wants to do this to keep control of the Democratic Party and to be able to swindle the money out of it
[00:34:45.612 --> 00:34:59.402]  Just like she's done for the last few decades because her major foundation is falling apart and has seen donations to it down almost 80% because there's no more pay per play.
[00:34:59.402 --> 00:35:06.547]  So the only way she can stay in the game is to at least start the run.
[00:35:06.547 --> 00:35:10.470]  Some are saying even early, like Trump's done.
[00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:11.511]  Start the run next year.
[00:35:12.967 --> 00:35:23.438]  And then use that to keep her nose in the party, and then parlay it into controlling who the nominee is down the road, because she does have so many documented health problems that have been confirmed.
[00:35:23.438 --> 00:35:25.220]  I mean, my God, she falls down everywhere she goes.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.822]  She looks like hell.
[00:35:26.822 --> 00:35:29.225]  Bill Clinton looks like his expiration date was out 20 years ago.
[00:35:29.225 --> 00:35:30.186]  He looks like molding bread.
[00:35:31.638 --> 00:35:35.343]  It's clear that they're not long for this world, you know, five, ten years max.
[00:35:35.343 --> 00:35:39.768]  And who would try then to cling to power like that, like Hitler in his bunker?
[00:35:39.768 --> 00:35:45.235]  Well, when you've got so many crimes coming out, you need to look strong to your party.
[00:35:45.235 --> 00:35:48.559]  You need to look like you're going to win.
[00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:49.040]  It's a bluff.
[00:35:50.367 --> 00:35:53.448]  That's why they tried to unseat the delegates for Trump.
[00:35:53.448 --> 00:35:55.809]  They stole the nomination from Sanders.
[00:35:55.809 --> 00:35:58.390]  They tried to then push impeachment of the president.
[00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:08.494]  They have deep staters staying in, and you see Brennan, and you see Clapper, and you see them all in the news, saying, stay in government and resist the president.
[00:36:08.494 --> 00:36:10.215]  Don't follow his orders.
[00:36:10.215 --> 00:36:15.437]  And if you're young and Trump tries to hire you, don't do it or you'll be blackballed once we get rid of him.
[00:36:15.437 --> 00:36:16.537]  That's all over the news.
[00:36:16.537 --> 00:36:17.538]  Overthrow the president.
[00:36:19.994 --> 00:36:21.835]  Kidnap his son and rape him.
[00:36:21.835 --> 00:36:22.795]  Harass everybody.
[00:36:22.795 --> 00:36:23.896]  Surround the Capitol.
[00:36:23.896 --> 00:36:30.419]  Don't let him get a Supreme Court nominee confirmed that he's about to announce tonight at 9 o'clock Eastern.
[00:36:30.419 --> 00:36:33.141]  And so, yes, Hillary is planning to run.
[00:36:33.141 --> 00:36:35.982]  She's already told her people this.
[00:36:35.982 --> 00:36:43.426]  And I know some sources locally in the Democratic Party that are high up, and also nationally, and I called them and I said, so she's running.
[00:36:45.185 --> 00:36:46.586]  Man, I tell you, people are crazy.
[00:36:46.586 --> 00:36:47.626]  America rejected her.
[00:36:47.626 --> 00:36:50.067]  They're very arrogant back until they catch themselves.
[00:36:50.067 --> 00:36:52.568]  They're like, well, how do you know?
[00:36:52.568 --> 00:36:55.790]  And I'm like, well, it's in the news and I just bluffed you.
[00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:57.230]  Then they get a little bit owl-y.
[00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.411]  But I have talked to
[00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:07.473]  Three Democrats who've already been told, and I'm talking people that run major operations, okay?
[00:37:07.473 --> 00:37:09.554]  So I have sources on and off record, obviously.
[00:37:09.554 --> 00:37:15.017]  So Joel Gilbert's done a great job laying this all out, and he's the guy that first broke it on Friday.
[00:37:15.017 --> 00:37:17.638]  Here's why Hillary Clinton is running again in 2020.
[00:37:17.638 --> 00:37:21.219]  We've reposted it at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:37:21.219 --> 00:37:22.500]  It's from American Thinker.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.221]  It's also at JoelGilbert.net.
[00:37:25.221 --> 00:37:27.162]  And Joel joins us always with big
[00:37:27.722 --> 00:37:28.323]  Breaking news.
[00:37:28.323 --> 00:37:32.346]  I appreciate you coming on on short notice.
[00:37:32.346 --> 00:37:39.211]  You lay it all out here, but you get into some other facets, but just recapping it right up front.
[00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:42.414]  I've talked to my Republican sources, Democrat sources, all of them.
[00:37:42.414 --> 00:37:45.436]  They say, of course, that's a no brainer.
[00:37:45.436 --> 00:37:51.781]  And of course, the president, let's play a clip of the president if we can, has said repeatedly that he'd love to run against Hillary.
[00:37:51.781 --> 00:37:53.142]  So here's President Trump on that.
[00:37:56.493 --> 00:37:57.513]  I hope Hillary runs.
[00:37:57.513 --> 00:37:58.314]  Is she going to run?
[00:37:58.314 --> 00:37:58.934]  I hope.
[00:37:58.934 --> 00:38:00.354]  Hillary, please run again.
[00:38:00.354 --> 00:38:01.575]  Go ahead.
[00:38:01.575 --> 00:38:06.776]  So, and he also says he wants Maxine Waters to continue to be the face of the Democratic Party.
[00:38:06.776 --> 00:38:14.959]  So, Joel, from your sources and just from your research, take us to the end first and then walk us through from the beginning.
[00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:22.201]  But going to the end of the book right now, are my sources accurate from your sources that she indeed is already told the party and it's a done deal?
[00:38:23.607 --> 00:38:26.568]  Yeah, I think you can see that it's a done deal.
[00:38:26.568 --> 00:38:28.729]  That's what all my sources were telling me.
[00:38:28.729 --> 00:38:44.756]  And if you just look at her actions and look at the equation, picking up from where you left off is the reason the Clintons have stayed out of jail for 30 years, despite a rap sheet that would make Al Capone blush, is because they make the jailers live in fear.
[00:38:44.756 --> 00:38:50.398]  You saw Lisa Page wrote Peter Strzok, be easy on Hillary because she might be president.
[00:38:51.204 --> 00:38:56.968]  So, as long as people think that the Clintons have power, might be in power, they're not going to be prosecuted.
[00:38:56.968 --> 00:38:58.809]  That's part of the equation.
[00:38:58.809 --> 00:39:02.631]  Another big part of the equation is simply Hillary's life mantra.
[00:39:02.631 --> 00:39:03.992]  You've heard her say it a million times.
[00:39:03.992 --> 00:39:15.039]  When I was six years old, my mother told me that even though I got knocked down and the other little girls hit me and I fell down, life is not about getting knocked down, it's how you get back up.
[00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:15.639]  Yes.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:42.792]  In 2020, on the Democrat side, you're going to have probably the very best potential candidates are going to stay away because they're going to think Trump is too tough to beat and they don't want to ruin their prospects for 2024.
[00:39:42.792 --> 00:39:50.380]  So what you've got is a group of publicity hounds running with Hillary Clinton, and she's going to be able to get an easy 25% of the vote.
[00:39:51.937 --> 00:39:57.720]  Based on name recognition and her loyal followers with the other 10 candidates splitting the vote.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.301]  Now Trump did something very similar.
[00:39:59.301 --> 00:40:06.725]  He had a loyal core of supporters and every time someone dropped out he'd pick up about half of those and the rest would split.
[00:40:06.725 --> 00:40:09.346]  So this is called a path to the nomination.
[00:40:09.346 --> 00:40:18.731]  Hillary is the only person that has a realistic path and it is realistic and I think it's going to be irresistible for her not to take that path.
[00:40:19.386 --> 00:40:20.007]  That's right.
[00:40:36.219 --> 00:40:47.968]  Trump all evidence shows won by a gigantic popular vote landslide, but they clearly stole at least six states, got caught in the computers by Homeland Security, state security, and five others.
[00:40:47.968 --> 00:40:56.455]  This all came out, Democrats, like Bev Harris, she's a liberal, but she said no, Trump had a bunch of states stolen from him, so they're going to go all in.
[00:40:57.619 --> 00:40:58.560]  They're going to go all in.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:07.544]  Don't forget, remember Hillary did not concede even though she lost because in 2016 they were waiting for maybe some votes to be found in Michigan.
[00:41:07.544 --> 00:41:14.888]  And that's the first time I looked it up in US history ever that someone didn't come out and give a concession speech.
[00:41:14.888 --> 00:41:15.469]  Right.
[00:41:15.469 --> 00:41:22.453]  So all they really need to do is flip five counties in three swing states.
[00:41:22.453 --> 00:41:23.753]  Hillary can get 300% of the vote.
[00:41:25.672 --> 00:41:28.915]  In five counties, in three swing states.
[00:41:28.915 --> 00:41:36.961]  When the Republicans start complaining, Attorney General Keith Ellison will call them racists and put them on the watch list for hate speech.
[00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:39.182]  That's how close it was last time.
[00:41:39.182 --> 00:41:43.165]  They can flip a few counties through all these tricks, and it's not inconceivable.
[00:41:43.165 --> 00:41:48.149]  Don't forget, Hillary has a billion dollars stored away for a rainy day.
[00:41:48.149 --> 00:41:54.494]  I mean, you didn't really think that all that Russian money that went to the Clinton Foundation actually went to hungry children in Haiti, do you?
[00:41:55.334 --> 00:41:55.775]  Absolutely.
[00:41:55.775 --> 00:42:09.044]  Let me, when we come back, give you... I'm going to go ahead and give some inside baseball out here, but you know why they're putting all this Sandy Hook stuff out against me in the news that's twisted and not accurate, and why they're also doing all the other Pizzagate things that aren't accurate against me.
[00:42:09.044 --> 00:42:16.189]  Democrats at the highest level have been told they're going to partially run on that in 2020, equating Trump with me.
[00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:20.191]  Even though Hillary already did it in 2016 and it didn't work.
[00:42:20.191 --> 00:42:29.336]  So that's another reason we know they're running thousands of articles demonizing me just to get name recognition up as a negative with Democrats to use me against Trump.
[00:42:29.336 --> 00:42:36.319]  Which is another reason I was told by Washington Insiders, yeah dude, they're not running all these ads for nothing.
[00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:40.081]  Because these aren't news articles, these are paid ads.
[00:42:40.081 --> 00:42:44.183]  Newsweek and all these other groups, it's coming out as a scandal, have been paid.
[00:42:45.253 --> 00:42:48.757]  To run all this disinformation against George Truly.
[00:42:48.757 --> 00:42:50.739]  So that's another sign Hillary is in there.
[00:42:50.739 --> 00:42:54.203]  They're not doing all these attack pieces on me just for fun.
[00:42:54.203 --> 00:42:56.926]  They are building me up as a demon to hurt Trump.
[00:42:59.369 --> 00:43:03.310]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:06.611]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.611 --> 00:43:12.873]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.873 --> 00:43:15.634]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:16.394 --> 00:43:20.196]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.196 --> 00:43:26.679]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.679 --> 00:43:31.642]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.389 --> 00:43:36.311]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.311 --> 00:43:43.514]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.514 --> 00:43:48.217]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.217 --> 00:43:54.420]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.402]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:05.984]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have in InfoWars life, it'd take hours.
[00:44:05.984 --> 00:44:08.426]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:44:08.426 --> 00:44:09.607]  It's stronger.
[00:44:09.607 --> 00:44:11.228]  It's the other equation in probiotics.

[00:44:39.293 --> 00:44:40.493]  I don't know.

[00:46:05.378 --> 00:46:05.958]  Thanks for calling.
[00:46:05.958 --> 00:46:07.380]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:11.043]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:46:11.043 --> 00:46:19.730]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:36.017]  That's pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[00:46:36.517 --> 00:46:45.119]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:50.000]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.262]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[00:47:03.284 --> 00:47:25.633]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.633 --> 00:47:31.835]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:32.791 --> 00:47:34.872]  Well, looks like Trump may get his witch.
[00:47:34.872 --> 00:47:37.233]  Hillary Clinton is running for president 2020.
[00:47:37.233 --> 00:47:39.214]  You're hearing it here exclusively with Joel Gilbert.
[00:47:39.214 --> 00:47:41.035]  But here's the president talking about it recently.
[00:47:41.035 --> 00:47:43.636]  Oh, I hope Hillary runs.
[00:47:43.636 --> 00:47:44.456]  Is she going to run?
[00:47:44.456 --> 00:47:45.056]  I hope.
[00:47:45.056 --> 00:47:46.477]  Hillary, please run again.
[00:47:46.477 --> 00:47:47.257]  Go ahead.
[00:47:47.257 --> 00:47:48.218]  He was going to take
[00:47:49.522 --> 00:47:57.888]  Nancy Pelosi's place and I was so disappointed because I want to keep Nancy Pelosi right where she is with Maxine Waters.
[00:47:57.888 --> 00:48:00.389]  I want to keep Nancy Pelosi.
[00:48:00.389 --> 00:48:05.072]  Please, I want to make a plea to my Democrat friends.
[00:48:05.072 --> 00:48:10.176]  Please, please, please don't remove Nancy Pelosi.
[00:48:10.176 --> 00:48:12.197]  She should be where she is.
[00:48:12.197 --> 00:48:18.621]  And please keep Maxine Waters on the air as your face.
[00:48:19.783 --> 00:48:23.010]  And your mouthpiece for the Democrat Party.
[00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:26.899]  Leave!
[00:48:26.899 --> 00:48:28.763]  Now I will tell you, I have talked to
[00:48:30.345 --> 00:48:43.289]  Folks in the Trump system, very high level, and I've just told them, hey, clearly they're running thousands of articles a month saying things about me and Sandy Hook and things I didn't say to demonize me and tie it to Trump, try to hurt the President.
[00:48:43.289 --> 00:48:48.891]  And I know Hillary's behind it, I know they're financing it, and I know that Soros is paying the news to run these articles.
[00:48:48.891 --> 00:48:51.512]  This is paid false content.
[00:48:51.512 --> 00:48:53.913]  It's bigger than just shutting me down.
[00:48:53.913 --> 00:48:56.074]  And they've told me, oh no, we're fully aware of that.
[00:48:56.074 --> 00:48:59.335]  Just like Hillary spent $18 million on one ad,
[00:49:00.518 --> 00:49:05.582]  of clips of myself edited out of context to then say this is Trump's buddy.
[00:49:05.582 --> 00:49:14.629]  But the crazy thing is they're going to be running against an economy that's doing better, thousands of new factories, all this good things Trump's doing.
[00:49:14.629 --> 00:49:18.832]  And then they think it's going to be Alex Jones.
[00:49:18.832 --> 00:49:20.313]  I'm not kidding.
[00:49:20.313 --> 00:49:24.557]  That is what they already ran against Trump with Alex Jones as one of their main
[00:49:26.314 --> 00:49:27.756]  Centerpieces.
[00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:29.157]  This is, this is bizarre.
[00:49:29.157 --> 00:49:30.378]  This is Twilight Zone.
[00:49:30.378 --> 00:49:36.265]  So I didn't mean to write myself as a gonzo journalist into the story here, but that's indeed what's happened, Joel.
[00:49:36.265 --> 00:49:41.511]  So give me your take on that, and then let's get back into your seminal
[00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:43.012]  We're good to go.
[00:50:02.912 --> 00:50:04.414]  And they've tried multiple times.
[00:50:04.414 --> 00:50:08.859]  The FBI's been questioning people about you and I in association with Roger Stone.
[00:50:08.859 --> 00:50:10.882]  Criminal investigations, new ones have been opened.
[00:50:10.882 --> 00:50:14.366]  This one was closed on you in 2016.
[00:50:14.366 --> 00:50:19.652]  They wanted to lock you up saying it's a federal elections violation for you to make a movie.
[00:50:20.498 --> 00:50:22.519]  about Obama three years before.
[00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:33.046]  So this shows how anti-free speech and the same Democrats on the Federal Elections Commission, as you know, wanted me arrested as well for my films.
[00:50:33.046 --> 00:50:37.009]  So, Joel, let's just remember where we'd be if Hillary got in and why this is so dangerous.
[00:50:37.009 --> 00:50:43.053]  But let's go back to what you were getting into in your piece breaking down why it's the perfect storm for her to run again.
[00:50:44.133 --> 00:50:45.094]  Right, we'll get into that.
[00:50:45.094 --> 00:50:46.754]  It is the perfect storm.
[00:50:46.754 --> 00:50:51.457]  Look, the Electoral College heavily favors Democrats still.
[00:50:51.457 --> 00:50:58.981]  In the key swing states, they're already busy registering new voters, illegal voters, motor voter, you name it.
[00:50:58.981 --> 00:51:05.985]  And they certainly have deep state leftists in the government that they expect are going to leak things about Trump right before the election.
[00:51:05.985 --> 00:51:08.366]  Tom Arnold, the actor, has been claiming he's got a
[00:51:09.186 --> 00:51:09.286]  Yes.
[00:51:25.706 --> 00:51:33.489]  Attorney General James Comey, McCabe, a head of the FBI, Loretta Lynch on the Supreme Court, and all of the amendments would be under attack.
[00:51:33.489 --> 00:51:35.890]  First Amendment, Second Amendment, Fourth Amendment.
[00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:42.672]  And as you mentioned, my movie, Dreams from My Real Father, where I think I proved that Obama's real father was not the Kenyan Obama.
[00:51:42.672 --> 00:51:45.193]  He was not the son of a goat herder from Kenya.
[00:51:45.193 --> 00:51:51.415]  His father was a Soviet agent who he admits raised him in Hawaii and radicalized him in his youth.
[00:51:51.415 --> 00:51:52.596]  And by the way, your film...
[00:51:53.396 --> 00:51:56.518]  Your film is absolutely conclusive.
[00:51:56.518 --> 00:51:59.499]  I mean, it is just out of the park, documented.
[00:51:59.499 --> 00:52:01.961]  You cracked the case.
[00:52:01.961 --> 00:52:02.401]  Absolutely.
[00:52:02.401 --> 00:52:03.361]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:52:03.361 --> 00:52:09.505]  And look, I didn't exactly win at the FEC like it said on the Washington Post.
[00:52:09.505 --> 00:52:10.905]  It was tied three to three.
[00:52:10.905 --> 00:52:16.588]  The three Republicans wanted to dismiss it because I'm a media entity like CNN, like Infowars.
[00:52:16.588 --> 00:52:18.769]  If you're a media entity, it's been established for 30, 50 years.
[00:52:20.211 --> 00:52:24.913]  You're not in an election, you're just giving opinions and information.
[00:52:24.913 --> 00:52:32.097]  Three Democrats on the FEC wanted to forward me to the Justice Department for prosecution, so it died three to three.
[00:52:32.097 --> 00:52:41.882]  So had Hillary won, she would have appointed another commissioner to break the ties, or gotten rid of one of the Republicans, and every conservative would be on a hate speech list.
[00:52:41.882 --> 00:52:42.522]  And let's be clear!
[00:52:42.522 --> 00:52:43.603]  And you could be prosecuted.
[00:52:43.803 --> 00:52:48.049]  The very same time they did that to Infowars, it actually shed.
[00:52:48.049 --> 00:52:52.695]  We refer him for Russia collusion to the Justice Department, but then they voted against it.
[00:52:52.695 --> 00:52:54.398]  And it's totally insane!
[00:52:54.398 --> 00:52:57.141]  But it shows what would have happened if Hillary would have gotten in.
[00:52:57.141 --> 00:52:58.443]  And so they think they've got...
[00:52:59.284 --> 00:53:01.826]  More than a Hail Mary here.
[00:53:01.826 --> 00:53:02.827]  And it's all lined up.
[00:53:02.827 --> 00:53:05.409]  Like you said, no real candidates are going to run against Trump.
[00:53:05.409 --> 00:53:06.470]  Hillary's got the war chest.
[00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:12.314]  She wants to stay in the power structure, at least of her party, so that she can not get indicted.
[00:53:12.314 --> 00:53:16.177]  So what do we start doing ahead of time to defeat her?
[00:53:16.177 --> 00:53:19.019]  So I notice the Democratic operatives are always saying, leave Hillary alone.
[00:53:19.019 --> 00:53:20.320]  She's the past.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.202]  Their bots attack us and say, Jones, quit talking about Hillary.
[00:53:23.202 --> 00:53:23.963]  She's the past.
[00:53:23.963 --> 00:53:24.583]  No, no, no.
[00:53:24.583 --> 00:53:27.406]  They don't want us exposing her now and going after her now.
[00:53:28.446 --> 00:53:33.812]  Because they want to keep her ready in the bleachers to, you know, run out on the field in the fourth quarter.
[00:53:33.812 --> 00:53:38.778]  So what do you think as a smart strategist we should be doing against Hillary right now to really savage her?
[00:53:40.242 --> 00:53:49.908]  I think the main battle is going to be on the voter fraud issue, voter ID issues, because that's where they're waging their battles in all the different states.
[00:53:49.908 --> 00:53:53.571]  I want to point out one other thing from the Democrat point of view.
[00:53:53.571 --> 00:53:58.634]  Some of them may see Hillary as cannon fodder, just like Bob Dole was running against Clinton.
[00:53:58.634 --> 00:54:00.075]  They may say, you know what?
[00:54:00.075 --> 00:54:02.117]  Trump may be unbeatable.
[00:54:02.117 --> 00:54:03.738]  Let's let her be cannon fodder.
[00:54:03.738 --> 00:54:07.560]  And we might even be better off with four more years of Trump.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.942]  We'll tell everybody that he's racist and sexist.
[00:54:10.802 --> 00:54:17.686]  And we'll set ourselves up for the ultimate death match for America in 2024, capitalism versus socialism.
[00:54:17.686 --> 00:54:29.233]  And maybe we'll have a younger, newer candidate, probably an ethnic candidate, you know, like Joe Biden said about Obama, articulate and bright and clean, but even more radical, another stealth radical.
[00:54:29.233 --> 00:54:34.556]  So they may not even care so much about winning a nomination, taking it from Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:34.556 --> 00:54:37.598]  That's another reason that she knows the nomination can be hers.
[00:54:38.422 --> 00:54:42.063]  But watch out because Hillary will want to win at all costs.
[00:54:42.063 --> 00:54:43.364]  She has the money.
[00:54:43.364 --> 00:54:46.825]  And I think they've specialized in voter fraud for so many years.
[00:54:46.825 --> 00:54:49.726]  Back in Chicago, you know, every cemetery voted.
[00:54:49.726 --> 00:54:52.727]  That's how Obama got into the state Senate in the first place.
[00:54:53.702 --> 00:54:57.884]  So, I think the economy and the public is going to get it.
[00:54:57.884 --> 00:55:01.845]  The big issue is going to be, can they manipulate the votes?
[00:55:01.845 --> 00:55:07.767]  George Soros, of course, the voting machine manufacturer, what a coincidence that he's in that business.
[00:55:07.767 --> 00:55:10.528]  He owns a third of the machines, people vote on it.
[00:55:10.528 --> 00:55:11.989]  And let's also not forget Joel.
[00:55:13.823 --> 00:55:18.705]  That they're going to be trying to have race riots, like they've kept their hat, their hand.
[00:55:18.705 --> 00:55:21.406]  They want to sabotage the economy.
[00:55:21.406 --> 00:55:25.987]  So they've got a lot of things going that they think will allow them to defeat Trump.
[00:55:25.987 --> 00:55:28.548]  And they also keep saying, don't worry, he's anomaly.
[00:55:28.548 --> 00:55:30.529]  We're going to get him out of there in one term now.
[00:55:30.529 --> 00:55:31.549]  So you're right.
[00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:33.230]  They're confident con men.
[00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:34.691]  They think they can defeat Trump.
[00:55:34.691 --> 00:55:35.491]  Hillary is running.
[00:55:37.014 --> 00:55:44.456]  I think Hillary is running and they feel like she has a, she knows she has a path of nomination and they feel that there is a path to defeat Trump.
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:56:00.603]  Even if they don't defeat Trump, I think they're going to spend the next four years agitating, race-baiting, and registering illegals, and trying to have that ultimate death match against a personality that's not as strong as Trump.
[00:56:00.603 --> 00:56:08.244]  But Hillary absolutely has, I think, the ability through her $10 billion of free earned media, don't forget.
[00:56:08.244 --> 00:56:10.165]  People forget it was 95% negative about Trump.
[00:56:11.847 --> 00:56:13.307]  On the earned media.
[00:56:13.307 --> 00:56:18.168]  You've got Tom Arnold saying he's got damning tapes.
[00:56:18.168 --> 00:56:19.529]  Anything could happen.
[00:56:19.529 --> 00:56:30.431]  So the stakes are going to be so high in 2020, I think patriots are going to have to rally once again to prevent Hillary Clinton from closing the door on the Constitution.
[00:56:30.431 --> 00:56:39.973]  Do you think Drudge's prophecy is coming true that it will just be President Hillary out in the future in a glass jar with bubbles like a science fiction movie?
[00:56:42.074 --> 00:56:43.995]  If it was up to Hillary, she would do it.
[00:56:43.995 --> 00:56:50.879]  She's probably, you know, using some of that billion dollars to see how she can be preserved.
[00:56:50.879 --> 00:56:54.581]  A lot of our thinking that, well, she's too frail.
[00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:56.982]  She's been fainting and falling down her whole life.
[00:56:56.982 --> 00:57:02.225]  I have inside sources that she's always kind of been in some level of frail health.
[00:57:02.225 --> 00:57:09.729]  So from her point of view, it's nothing really that new, whereas conservatives are just kind of seeing it on display for the first time because she's out in the public so much.
[00:57:10.356 --> 00:57:13.418]  Uh, but I think she'll tape herself together in any manner possible.
[00:57:40.436 --> 00:57:44.162]  Spread those live links to InfoWars.com, the live video and audio feeds.
[00:57:44.162 --> 00:57:45.864]  That's how we bypass the censors.
[00:57:45.864 --> 00:57:47.526]  You, you are the resistance!
[00:57:49.653 --> 00:57:51.614]  This 4th of July is special.
[00:57:51.614 --> 00:57:53.596]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[00:57:53.596 --> 00:57:58.039]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[00:57:58.039 --> 00:58:02.402]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[00:58:02.402 --> 00:58:07.506]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[00:58:07.506 --> 00:58:11.269]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[00:58:12.109 --> 00:58:14.392]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[00:58:14.392 --> 00:58:16.334]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[00:58:16.334 --> 00:58:19.497]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[00:58:19.497 --> 00:58:26.644]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[00:58:26.644 --> 00:58:28.506]  We have record sales going on right now.
[00:58:29.491 --> 00:58:35.794]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:35.794 --> 00:58:35.994]  It's you!
[00:58:59.864 --> 00:59:02.346]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:02.346 --> 00:59:03.727]  You are the info war.
[00:59:03.727 --> 00:59:06.650]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:21.002 --> 00:59:32.389]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:32.389 --> 00:59:40.353]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:40.353 --> 00:59:47.417]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:50.159]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:52.788 --> 00:59:55.911]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:55.911 --> 01:00:04.519]  So, we kicked off the Hillary for Prison movement.
[01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:06.981]  We turned the locker up.
[01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:08.543]  We put 100,000 t-shirts on the streets.
[01:00:14.755 --> 01:00:19.641]  We've got a new one that's Re-Elect 45 that I think should be the seminal shirt.
[01:00:19.641 --> 01:00:22.924]  At InfolarStore.com, we've got some of Joel Gilbert's films as well.
[01:00:22.924 --> 01:00:26.428]  If you haven't seen Dreams of My Real Father, they tried to put him in jail for it.
[01:00:26.428 --> 01:00:27.349]  I mean, wow.
[01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:28.611]  They don't like Joel Gilbert.
[01:00:28.611 --> 01:00:29.271]  They don't like me.
[01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:30.312]  But Joel, you're a smart guy.
[01:00:30.312 --> 01:00:32.355]  Let me bring this up.
[01:00:32.355 --> 01:00:33.236]  They've really got it out.
[01:00:34.417 --> 01:00:37.998]  For you, for myself, for Roger Stone, for others, because we've been very effective.
[01:00:37.998 --> 01:00:48.982]  Conservatively, your Danny Williams film, that only cost $35,000, reached close to 40 million people in key targeted demographic urban black areas.
[01:00:48.982 --> 01:00:50.843]  They really, it really resonated.
[01:00:50.843 --> 01:00:53.544]  We saw poll numbers go that way.
[01:00:53.544 --> 01:00:59.226]  You see Trump doubling his numbers with black males, doubling his numbers with Hispanics in many polls.
[01:00:59.226 --> 01:01:01.947]  I mean, they're really panicking, but then you look at their
[01:01:03.047 --> 01:01:18.858]  Men against women angle, all white people are racist angle, abolish ICE angle, and then Alex Jones, you know, was mean to shooting victims' families and Trump knows him.
[01:01:18.858 --> 01:01:24.062]  I mean, that's one of their main campaign things, and I don't think that's going to be successful.
[01:01:24.062 --> 01:01:25.903]  Why do you think they're going with that?
[01:01:25.903 --> 01:01:32.328]  Give me your media expertise on what you think they're going to do, because I'm just selfishly wanting to know your view.
[01:01:34.051 --> 01:01:38.074]  Look, socialism and liberalism is completely vapid.
[01:01:38.074 --> 01:01:39.315]  It's void of facts.
[01:01:39.315 --> 01:01:50.104]  It's void of any reason to support economic policies where you take property from the individual, where the government controls everything and everybody, where you need a police force to force people to work.
[01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:57.808]  And somehow this is going to reach happiness, utopia, peace on earth with the head of the party as the god on earth.
[01:01:57.808 --> 01:02:05.633]  This entire system has been tried in the 20th century and resulted in 150 million people killed in peacetime in their own countries.
[01:02:05.633 --> 01:02:08.795]  So there's no policy they can possibly run on.
[01:02:08.795 --> 01:02:10.516]  So they're desperate to think of things that
[01:02:11.445 --> 01:02:15.848]  Might say, oh, you know, he's so mean, or he knows this guy.
[01:02:15.848 --> 01:02:18.570]  And they just don't have any creativity.
[01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.432]  Socialism itself is a war against creativity.
[01:02:21.432 --> 01:02:22.613]  So they don't have any left.
[01:02:23.647 --> 01:02:24.728]  They proved themselves.
[01:02:24.728 --> 01:02:33.278]  The Clintons proved in the 1990s that somebody can commit rape and sexual abuse and the voters don't care.
[01:02:33.278 --> 01:02:38.584]  So they're pretty stupid to try something like that against Trump in the last election.
[01:02:38.584 --> 01:02:41.688]  When he didn't even do it and then it reminds everybody of what they did.
[01:02:42.612 --> 01:02:43.712]  Exactly.
[01:02:43.712 --> 01:02:47.633]  So they just lack any creativity, an ounce of creativity.
[01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:49.393]  There's the one that colluded with Russia.
[01:02:49.393 --> 01:03:00.296]  They paid $12 million to the DNC to pay Fusion GPS to pay a bunch of Russian KGB $300,000 per page.
[01:03:00.296 --> 01:03:01.676]  So they're so uncreative.
[01:03:01.676 --> 01:03:06.557]  All they can do is say, Trump, Trump colluded with Russia.
[01:03:06.557 --> 01:03:07.317]  They have nothing.
[01:03:07.317 --> 01:03:09.498]  They have no creativity in their minds.
[01:03:09.498 --> 01:03:10.958]  And this is the kind of stuff you're going to get.
[01:03:11.838 --> 01:03:13.479]  Exactly.
[01:03:13.479 --> 01:03:15.481]  I didn't even know this until this weekend.
[01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:18.403]  Nunez is going after 45, 44 people now.
[01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:23.747]  And what he released was, did you know they created another Fusion GPS that was really part of it?
[01:03:23.747 --> 01:03:32.374]  And they gave it $50 million, and then Nunez found another $20 million, so $50, $18, $20.
[01:03:32.374 --> 01:03:39.839]  I mean, we're talking about close to $90 million here that they spent on this stuff.
[01:03:39.839 --> 01:03:40.340]  What is that?
[01:03:41.616 --> 01:03:44.648]  Well, let's circle the conversation back.
[01:03:44.648 --> 01:03:47.318]  Hillary was funding the DNC because they were broke.
[01:03:47.961 --> 01:03:52.543]  They got broke again paying off Russians to write all this fiction.
[01:03:52.543 --> 01:03:54.584]  So the DNC is broke again.
[01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:58.045]  So Hillary has the same opportunity she did four years ago.
[01:03:58.045 --> 01:04:01.527]  She can offer to fund the DNC if she can cause the shots.
[01:04:01.527 --> 01:04:07.049]  That way she's going to control what happens, control the debates, the schedule, and make herself the nominee.
[01:04:07.049 --> 01:04:12.411]  She's just going to repeat the same losing formula, except you've got to be aware of the voter fraud.
[01:04:14.244 --> 01:04:26.573]  Joel Gilbert, you are absolutely on fire, my friend, and you're on target, and it absolutely makes sense, and we just have to get organized and figure out how we're going to try to counter this and make sure that we do make the country great again.
[01:04:26.573 --> 01:04:28.434]  It's a race against pure evil.
[01:04:28.434 --> 01:04:29.175]  God bless you.
[01:04:29.175 --> 01:04:37.101]  Folks can find your films at infowarstore.com or joelgilbert.net, and join us again soon, and tell us about the next project you've got coming out.
[01:04:38.254 --> 01:04:43.001]  Okay, I'll be hosting on Friday, the fourth hour, so I'll be updating the audience at that time.
[01:04:43.001 --> 01:04:44.403]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:04:44.403 --> 01:04:48.970]  We'll be right back with a bunch of clips, a bunch of breaking news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:50.152]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:50.713]  Please stay with us.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:17.089]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[01:05:17.429 --> 01:05:18.230]  The revolution.
[01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:20.331]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.331 --> 01:05:24.053]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:31.598]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:33.979]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.979 --> 01:05:36.621]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.621 --> 01:05:39.422]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.422 --> 01:05:40.983]  InfoWarsLife.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:05:40.983 --> 01:05:42.564]  And you're purchasing the products
[01:05:45.646 --> 01:05:51.088]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.088 --> 01:06:06.053]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:06.053 --> 01:06:13.396]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:21.139]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:06:21.139 --> 01:06:31.049]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:31.049 --> 01:06:37.155]  We've got Theresa May trying to sabotage the Brexit and the British voters are hopping mad.
[01:06:37.155 --> 01:06:38.096]  We've got Macron.
[01:06:39.864 --> 01:06:48.414]  Walking back, mass migration tells migrants to succeed in Africa after he called for 200 million Africans to come to Europe.
[01:06:48.414 --> 01:06:55.222]  But his actions are opening the borders up, so these people just don't get how they're awakening folks.
[01:06:55.222 --> 01:06:58.205]  There's also an article up on DredgeReport.com that's really critical.
[01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:03.005]  By Michael Schneider from EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[01:07:03.005 --> 01:07:05.225]  It's posted to InfoWars.com.
[01:07:05.225 --> 01:07:07.206]  Mass exodus from the church.
[01:07:07.206 --> 01:07:12.749]  The percentage of young adults with no religious affiliation has nearly quadrupled since 1986.
[01:07:12.749 --> 01:07:18.111]  And I'm going to talk later in the next segment about why that's happened.
[01:07:18.111 --> 01:07:22.053]  It's been done by design.
[01:07:22.053 --> 01:07:25.834]  Because these are no longer churches, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:27.775]  They're little devil centers in most cases.
[01:07:29.619 --> 01:07:38.602]  So we're going to be looking at all of that and now I got another article, Dan Lyman, the head of Infowars Europe with Europewars.com.
[01:07:38.602 --> 01:07:45.564]  He is here in town working with us on a business visit from his home base in Switzerland.
[01:07:46.803 --> 01:08:04.649]  And he's going to be in studio to talk about the awakening of Europe, the next big wave coming in that's bigger than the one we just saw in the last five years, and the troops in Austria, Hungary, Poland, bracing for the human waves that we've seen on those famous drone videos of tens of thousands, like a giant snake.
[01:08:04.649 --> 01:08:08.030]  That is all coming up.
[01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:09.450]  Too dangerous!
[01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:13.832]  National Postal Service suspends
[01:08:16.681 --> 01:08:22.365]  Serbis to another Islamic enclave in Sweden.
[01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:36.974]  So now they admit no-go zones all over Europe when just two years ago they had BBC articles, London Guardian articles, you name it, saying Paul Joseph Watson was a white supremacist and was an insane liar basically.
[01:08:36.974 --> 01:08:41.697]  They don't even say that anymore because it would blow up in their face.
[01:08:41.697 --> 01:08:43.399]  That he claimed there were no-go zones.
[01:08:44.363 --> 01:08:50.687]  Well, he'd just been at one when people threatened to kill him with Joe Biggs and our crew.
[01:08:50.687 --> 01:09:02.935]  Shootings, bombings, you name it, are exploding and it's like Beirut and the British government just put a travel advisory out on going to Sweden.
[01:09:02.935 --> 01:09:06.057]  Sweden had the lowest crime rate in Europe after Switzerland.
[01:09:06.057 --> 01:09:08.459]  Now it is hellish.
[01:09:08.459 --> 01:09:11.701]  And they're bringing in populations that after five years, 90% don't have jobs.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.502]  And they only deport you if you try to get one.
[01:09:17.502 --> 01:09:20.545]  That's in Germany, Sweden, it's the same socialist policy.
[01:09:20.545 --> 01:09:39.322]  They want huge, angry, disenfranchised Muslim groups that come from literal dirt floor villages where women are sold on slave blocks and don't know what planet they're on, running around foaming at the mouth on welfare, ready to be politically directed.
[01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:45.874]  And after they killed Gaddafi, who was stabilizing much of Africa, it got 20 times worse.
[01:09:45.874 --> 01:09:50.599]  It was all planned out.
[01:09:50.599 --> 01:09:56.123]  See, if you could industrialize and educate people in North Africa, then you could bring them in.
[01:09:56.123 --> 01:10:00.087]  But you can't bring them in from road warrior scenarios.
[01:10:00.087 --> 01:10:00.948]  But enough of that.
[01:10:00.948 --> 01:10:05.992]  That's coming up.
[01:10:05.992 --> 01:10:06.412]  Right now.
[01:10:07.884 --> 01:10:10.606]  We are going to go to this little compilation.
[01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:13.028]  I've seen a lot of these compilations and I think Trump's right.
[01:10:13.028 --> 01:10:14.549]  He tweeted this out today.
[01:10:14.549 --> 01:10:18.672]  And we're going to tweet it out right now at Real Alex Jones.
[01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:19.433]  You should retweet it.
[01:10:19.433 --> 01:10:21.194]  To remember why the globalists are angry.
[01:10:21.194 --> 01:10:23.235]  Remember why the Democrats are so upset.
[01:10:23.235 --> 01:10:24.697]  Remember why they're foaming at the mouth.
[01:10:24.697 --> 01:10:29.120]  Remember why they are so aggressive and trying to bully people.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.582]  Because their identity is controlling you and running your life.
[01:10:32.526 --> 01:10:35.968]  And they all said Trump couldn't win, or they said Trump didn't want to win.
[01:10:35.968 --> 01:10:41.712]  And they said when he won, he would never turn the economy around, never have a 3% growth rate.
[01:10:41.712 --> 01:10:51.419]  Just like they told me when I was 19 years old and went in and tried to audition with the tape and tried to work at a radio station, they said, Trump Radio doesn't want you, boy.
[01:10:51.419 --> 01:10:52.840]  Laughed at me.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.762]  Then I got my first radio show and it was number one within a year in the city of Austin.
[01:10:56.762 --> 01:10:57.443]  Number one, period.
[01:10:57.443 --> 01:11:00.565]  And then they fired me because I wouldn't stop talking bad about Bill Clinton.
[01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:03.294]  And then the rest is history.
[01:11:03.294 --> 01:11:10.360]  So I love them, and we've got the right stuff, and America has the right stuff, and you've got the right stuff, no matter what color you are, or where you came from.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.044]  If you love God, if you love justice, if you have common sense, you've got the right stuff.
[01:11:15.044 --> 01:11:18.387]  And we're not going to live dependently under these globalists anymore.
[01:11:18.387 --> 01:11:22.931]  But it's important to remember why they hate Infowars, why they hate Trump, why they hate you.
[01:11:23.829 --> 01:11:24.149]  I don't know.
[01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:45.611]  They like strong people.
[01:11:45.611 --> 01:11:55.155]  Little, weak, weaselly people like them are the ones that always serve evil, because they lust after power, because they don't have innate power.
[01:11:55.155 --> 01:12:02.179]  When you have innate power, it's not an arrogance, it's not a pride, it's a understanding.
[01:12:02.179 --> 01:12:05.200]  And you don't want to prey on the weak.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:05.840]  Not these people.
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.441]  They want to prey on you and your family.
[01:12:07.441 --> 01:12:09.122]  So here's the video they don't want you to see.
[01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:16.692]  I am officially running for President of the United States.
[01:12:16.692 --> 01:12:17.732]  Could he actually win?
[01:12:17.732 --> 01:12:18.993]  No freaking way!
[01:12:18.993 --> 01:12:23.136]  Which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[01:12:23.136 --> 01:12:23.776]  Donald Trump.
[01:12:29.364 --> 01:12:31.345]  There's not going to be a President Donald Trump.
[01:12:31.345 --> 01:12:32.285]  Trump will not be President.
[01:12:32.285 --> 01:12:34.646]  Trump will never be elected President of the United States.
[01:12:34.646 --> 01:12:35.927]  You're not going to be President.
[01:12:35.927 --> 01:12:39.709]  A man who will never be President of the United States.
[01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:43.230]  Donald Trump is not going to be President of the United States to the bank.
[01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:45.591]  He will never be President.
[01:12:45.591 --> 01:12:48.593]  Donald Trump is not going to become President of the United States.
[01:12:49.684 --> 01:12:51.706]  She's at plus 19.
[01:12:51.706 --> 01:12:53.447]  Do you think the tapes made a difference?
[01:12:53.447 --> 01:12:54.668]  Of course!
[01:12:54.668 --> 01:12:56.550]  They made all the difference!
[01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:58.452]  This race is over.
[01:12:58.452 --> 01:13:03.236]  Hillary Clinton has raised more than double Donald Trump, vastly outspending him.
[01:13:03.236 --> 01:13:07.000]  The presidency at about 89% for Hillary Clinton.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.782]  Your analytical model has never been wrong.
[01:13:09.782 --> 01:13:12.765]  It projects Hillary Clinton to win the presidential election.
[01:13:12.765 --> 01:13:13.425]  100% chance.
[01:13:13.425 --> 01:13:16.268]  Do you still think she has a 100% chance of winning the election?
[01:13:16.828 --> 01:13:17.228]  I do.
[01:13:17.228 --> 01:13:19.829]  And what would Donald Trump have to do to turn things around?
[01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:23.111]  Prayer and hope for a Festivus miracle.
[01:13:23.111 --> 01:13:26.292]  This is CNN's coverage of election night in America.
[01:13:26.292 --> 01:13:27.613]  The fight for the presidency.
[01:13:27.613 --> 01:13:29.253]  Because we don't care.
[01:13:29.253 --> 01:13:30.094]  Okay, how Kentucky?
[01:13:30.094 --> 01:13:30.734]  Who cares?
[01:13:30.734 --> 01:13:32.255]  Kentucky don't care about Indiana.
[01:13:33.655 --> 01:13:36.116]  I don't care.
[01:13:36.116 --> 01:13:40.118]  Up and down the middle of the country.
[01:13:40.118 --> 01:13:40.939]  All red.
[01:13:40.939 --> 01:13:41.339]  Yes.
[01:13:41.339 --> 01:13:42.979]  It was at 80% an hour ago.
[01:13:42.979 --> 01:13:43.760]  For Clinton.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.660]  What is it now?
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:44.680]  68%.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:44.860]  Okay.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:45.521]  God, I'm nervous.
[01:14:02.789 --> 01:14:04.111]  Oh, oh, oh, hold, hold.
[01:14:04.111 --> 01:14:05.435]  Ohio, gone.
[01:14:05.435 --> 01:14:08.562]  Yeah, I don't see a f***ing landslide here.
[01:14:08.562 --> 01:14:09.624]  I don't see it at all.
[01:14:12.023 --> 01:14:14.745]  If we need Florida, are you f***ing me?
[01:14:14.745 --> 01:14:15.666]  Florida!
[01:14:15.666 --> 01:14:17.687]  It is f***ing panic time.
[01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:18.027]  Georgia!
[01:14:18.027 --> 01:14:20.809]  Donald Trump, now the favorite to win the presidency.
[01:14:20.809 --> 01:14:21.209]  Iowa!
[01:14:21.209 --> 01:14:25.853]  The New York Times now has it at 95% chance.
[01:14:25.853 --> 01:14:26.333]  Utah!
[01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:31.296]  We can still win, but in order to do so, she has to win Wisconsin.
[01:14:31.296 --> 01:14:32.257]  Wisconsin!
[01:14:32.257 --> 01:14:33.898]  Goddamn f***!
[01:14:33.898 --> 01:14:34.679]  Arizona!
[01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:35.339]  Alaska!
[01:14:35.339 --> 01:14:35.860]  Pennsylvania!
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:36.500]  Michigan!
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.341]  What a night!
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:50.645]  Do you remember when the New York Times, for the entire election, in the primaries and right through to election day, had Hillary at 98% chance of winning?
[01:14:50.645 --> 01:14:56.828]  Now, by election day, if it hedged their bets, it dropped to 82%, I remember.
[01:14:56.828 --> 01:14:59.829]  And you just saw the pundit talk about that from election night.
[01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:07.012]  And then, as the night went on, by 10 o'clock at night, they had it projected 50-50.
[01:15:09.585 --> 01:15:13.086]  They're not God.
[01:15:13.086 --> 01:15:15.347]  They're not God, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:15.347 --> 01:15:22.049]  They just tell you that there's no such thing as mothers and fathers and there's only 500 genders.
[01:15:22.049 --> 01:15:24.609]  They tell you vaccines are safe and effective.
[01:15:24.609 --> 01:15:27.090]  They tell you GMO is good for you.
[01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:29.351]  They tell you communism and socialism is good.
[01:15:30.256 --> 01:15:41.681]  And it's all this mind game with some pumpkin-headed demon witch with a bunch of scumbag Hollywood trash running around calling for civil war and death and saying we're in a civil war.
[01:15:41.681 --> 01:15:43.742]  And I go, OK, we're in a civil war.
[01:15:43.742 --> 01:15:45.703]  And they go, ha, ha, ha!
[01:15:45.703 --> 01:15:48.264]  All over the news, Alex Jones says we're in a civil war.
[01:15:48.264 --> 01:15:49.265]  What a kook!
[01:15:49.265 --> 01:15:51.046]  It's only on the cover of USA Today.
[01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.866]  And he only predicted it all.
[01:15:52.866 --> 01:15:54.107]  Gosh, he keeps being right.
[01:15:54.107 --> 01:15:54.987]  What do we do?
[01:15:54.987 --> 01:15:56.108]  Just ridicule him!
[01:15:57.316 --> 01:16:01.200]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:06.184]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[01:16:56.947 --> 01:16:58.208]  I had great results.
[01:16:58.208 --> 01:16:59.609]  I lost 70 pounds.
[01:16:59.609 --> 01:17:02.852]  I weighed 265 and went down to 195.
[01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:05.514]  My doctor told me, if it works for you, then do it.
[01:17:05.514 --> 01:17:07.936]  A lot of people say to me, how did you lose the weight?
[01:17:07.936 --> 01:17:09.597]  I said, I take Andro 400 every day.
[01:17:09.597 --> 01:17:10.878]  I'm going to take it forever.
[01:17:11.058 --> 01:17:13.499]  That was Walt talking about Andro 400.
[01:17:13.499 --> 01:17:15.060]  Now listen to what Bob has to say.
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:15.340]  Guys.

[01:20:01.815 --> 01:20:04.458]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:38.167]  We now take you live to the undisputed tip of the spear, of course, right out of Central Texas.
[01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:44.370]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:47.912]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:47.912 --> 01:20:51.394]  Coming to you from deep in red state Texas.
[01:20:51.394 --> 01:20:55.897]  Attempting a take back of the California invasion zone, known as Austin.
[01:20:57.882 --> 01:21:08.567]  I am your host, promoting Americana, libertarian, classical liberal ideas in the face of the fascistic cult of evil.
[01:21:08.567 --> 01:21:22.314]  That is, the New World Order, George Soros, Hillary Clinton, the big megabanks, the tech titans, all the censors, the EU, the unelected globalist system, the chi-com menace, funding the entire vicious system.
[01:21:23.814 --> 01:21:39.865]  It's set up to bring down America, but in the 11th hour, in the 59th minute, not just here in the U.S., but all over the world, populists and nationalists began to rise.
[01:21:39.865 --> 01:21:51.133]  That's how it always works in history, not just in movies, that in that final minute, the challenger arises.
[01:21:51.133 --> 01:21:52.714]  And when the challenger doesn't arise,
[01:21:54.193 --> 01:22:00.857]  Evil takes over and you get the nightmares we've seen that killed over 200 million people in the last century and have already killed tens of millions this century.
[01:22:00.857 --> 01:22:03.638]  Collectivism in all of its flavors.
[01:22:03.638 --> 01:22:07.040]  Normally socialist and communist.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:14.384]  Now despite the good things that are happening, here's the bad thing.
[01:22:14.384 --> 01:22:16.925]  We're becoming dependent on machines.
[01:22:16.925 --> 01:22:17.746]  We're becoming soft.
[01:22:18.988 --> 01:22:23.733]  Yes, we're politically awakening to the corrupt globalists, but not to their actual operations.
[01:22:23.733 --> 01:22:28.559]  Breaking up the family, dehumanizing us, and taking over institutions.
[01:22:30.253 --> 01:22:56.139]  Now I'm not going to engage in a historical treatise right now, just have some other big breaking news on how the World Council of Churches and the National Council of Churches in the last 70 years took over, via the ecumenical movement, everything from the Catholic Church to the main Protestant Church to the ecumenical system we see today, where most churches are New Age brainwashing centers.
[01:22:57.759 --> 01:23:06.763]  I mean, you go to mainline Methodist churches, other mainline ones, and you go to the actual study classes, it's Aleister Crowley stuff.
[01:23:06.763 --> 01:23:10.685]  Cheap dipped is Rosicrucian.
[01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:11.105]  It is...
[01:23:15.834 --> 01:23:17.796]  Masonic garbage.
[01:23:17.796 --> 01:23:20.998]  And I don't mean the classic masons like George Washington.
[01:23:20.998 --> 01:23:25.122]  I mean the whole Illuminati Masonic movement that George Washington wrote more than ten letters on.
[01:23:25.122 --> 01:23:30.526]  You can read online, Library of Congress, in his own handwriting, in HD.
[01:23:30.526 --> 01:23:35.471]  How the old Masonic movement was even taken over by devil worshippers.
[01:23:35.471 --> 01:23:38.553]  And that how our revolution was not the French Revolution.
[01:23:38.553 --> 01:23:43.377]  So you have to understand, everything you face, communism, all of it comes out of the Jacobins.
[01:23:43.377 --> 01:23:43.798]  And I've had
[01:23:45.276 --> 01:23:48.699]  Historians and British Lords on and Masonic experts.
[01:23:48.699 --> 01:23:54.864]  I mean, I've done History Channel and Discovery Channel shows where I'm the expert on Masonry.
[01:23:54.864 --> 01:23:56.886]  You ask, well, how do they make you the expert if you're not a Mason?
[01:23:56.886 --> 01:24:04.572]  Because I don't study all the separate sects and handshakes and, you know, the learning of the lore to become a Mason.
[01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:06.013]  I know it's history.
[01:24:06.013 --> 01:24:07.094]  I know what it really is.
[01:24:07.094 --> 01:24:09.236]  I know the different branches of it.
[01:24:09.236 --> 01:24:12.939]  I know what 33rd degree Masons know.
[01:24:12.939 --> 01:24:14.200]  I just skipped ahead to the end.
[01:24:16.363 --> 01:24:24.555]  And I was told by family all about it from the time I was a young child, because I've had ancestors, some of them that were 33rd degree Masons.
[01:24:24.555 --> 01:24:29.181]  Texas was founded by Masons, but they were the original type Masons.
[01:24:29.181 --> 01:24:32.166]  Super Christian, totally devout, but it was more of a
[01:24:35.054 --> 01:24:38.115]  True Rosicrucian type movement, but not even practicing.
[01:24:38.115 --> 01:24:42.475]  Proto-Christian, from before it got taken over and manipulated.
[01:24:42.475 --> 01:24:49.356]  And there were always occultic groups claiming that they were actually the true Christians, but it goes the whole Gnostic Christianity.
[01:24:49.356 --> 01:24:51.637]  And I mean, all that really means is hidden.
[01:24:51.637 --> 01:24:55.297]  But not in the occult sense of a modern occult, where you think it means devil.
[01:24:55.297 --> 01:24:57.158]  Occult only means hidden.
[01:24:57.158 --> 01:25:00.978]  Because you'll get killed if anybody knows what you're really practicing.
[01:25:00.978 --> 01:25:01.498]  A.K.A.
[01:25:01.498 --> 01:25:04.439]  the pilgrims trying to find a place to practice true Christianity.
[01:25:05.410 --> 01:25:11.633]  And build the New Atlantis, which they believe they would do and which they've now done.
[01:25:11.633 --> 01:25:13.614]  And I come from those people.
[01:25:13.614 --> 01:25:22.339]  So, the point is, and it's not bragging, you have to understand the core of all this before you can understand the bigger fight.
[01:25:22.339 --> 01:25:27.802]  The Jacobins launched and took over France and killed millions of people, and they targeted
[01:25:28.686 --> 01:25:29.466]  The upright.
[01:25:29.466 --> 01:25:31.227]  They weren't trying to get rid of the royalty.
[01:25:31.227 --> 01:25:36.430]  They were getting rid of one branch of royalty and then they brought in Napoleon Bonaparte after that.
[01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:39.051]  So they always bring in communism.
[01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:40.892]  Was not Karl Marx or Engels that invented it.
[01:25:40.892 --> 01:25:42.973]  It was the, it was the Jacobins.
[01:25:42.973 --> 01:25:45.694]  They were the communes.
[01:25:45.694 --> 01:25:46.675]  The guillotines.
[01:25:46.675 --> 01:25:47.515]  All of it.
[01:25:47.515 --> 01:25:48.635]  Nine day work week.
[01:25:48.635 --> 01:25:49.656]  Change the calendar.
[01:25:49.656 --> 01:25:53.638]  Abolish the family.
[01:25:53.638 --> 01:25:57.440]  You've, you've, you've heard of all that before.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:57.820]  And so,
[01:25:59.551 --> 01:26:12.153]  That's where we are today and they took over the churches, they tricked them into coming 501c3 to become charities so they would lose their First Amendment power of being outside the government under separation of church and state.
[01:26:12.153 --> 01:26:13.154]  See, Christians have been taught
[01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:24.325]  Oh, Thomas Jefferson's horrible, he had separation of church and state, and that's why we can't have, you know, our kid hand out Christmas cards or say they love Jesus or have I Love Jesus on their lunchbox.
[01:26:24.325 --> 01:26:28.028]  Your child has a total right as a private, independent citizen to do that.
[01:26:28.028 --> 01:26:32.412]  The school can't say you will serve this branch of religion.
[01:26:32.412 --> 01:26:39.398]  So they turn that around, overthrew the First Amendment, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:26:40.512 --> 01:26:58.587]  And so, once you see that set up, and once you understand that, then they just took over all the churches, told them they couldn't be political, claimed everything under the sun is political, the Democrats want to arrest me and Joel Gilbert for making films about Obama.
[01:26:58.587 --> 01:27:03.511]  Yeah, Obama deception, and Green's my real father,
[01:27:04.946 --> 01:27:06.908]  They said violated Federal Election Commission.
[01:27:06.908 --> 01:27:10.350]  They say Drudge violates the Federal Election Commission and they want him shut down.
[01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:22.839]  They came shy of one vote of a criminal indictment or referring criminal indictment to the Justice Department of Matt Drudge for his website linking to the news.
[01:27:22.839 --> 01:27:24.080]  So I digress.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:31.606]  I was going to say earlier, mass exodus from the church, the percentage of young adults with no religious affiliation has nearly quadrupled since 1986.
[01:27:34.861 --> 01:27:39.524]  And they bring in the video games, they bring in the slime fights, they bring in the paintball, and no one wants to go to the church.
[01:27:39.524 --> 01:27:44.688]  Because they're not churches, they're social clubs.
[01:27:44.688 --> 01:27:46.109]  What they need to hear is real...
[01:27:48.618 --> 01:28:00.509]  Teaching about the world and the nature of good and evil and the spiritual world all around us because in that is the spiritual power and people will feel it and they will see it and you won't be able to keep them away from it.
[01:28:00.509 --> 01:28:06.935]  I guarantee you that if I went and started a church within two years it'd have 10,000 members every Sunday.
[01:28:06.935 --> 01:28:08.576]  And I'm not even that good of a preacher.
[01:28:08.576 --> 01:28:13.300]  I would just lay out the Bible and talk about the contest between good and evil and compare it to every day.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.062]  It'd be three hours of preaching every Sunday.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:23.686]  People aren't in the churches because they're not hearing what the church really is.
[01:28:23.686 --> 01:28:31.735]  A coming together of the brethren, an understanding, and then a launching of that operation out into the world to save people.
[01:28:31.735 --> 01:28:38.403]  But now you've got the Great Falling Away taking place because they shut the churches down.
[01:28:40.165 --> 01:28:43.849]  And I'm not saying you can't have the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit of Churches 501c3.
[01:28:43.849 --> 01:28:46.811]  There are a lot of people that still preach the Gospel under 501c3.
[01:28:46.811 --> 01:28:50.835]  But there's so few of them that you ask, why is everybody falling away?
[01:28:50.835 --> 01:28:55.320]  Because they got rid of the real churches and the real Holy Spirit being in those churches.
[01:28:57.574 --> 01:29:01.437]  Tired of being censored by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Patreon?
[01:29:01.437 --> 01:29:03.159]  Well, now you don't have to be.

[01:30:02.627 --> 01:30:07.072]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[01:30:07.072 --> 01:30:11.437]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[01:30:11.437 --> 01:30:16.542]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[01:30:16.542 --> 01:30:20.286]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[01:30:21.127 --> 01:30:23.410]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[01:30:23.410 --> 01:30:25.353]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:28.518]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[01:30:28.518 --> 01:30:35.668]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.

[01:33:09.933 --> 01:33:11.094]  Big Brother.
[01:33:11.094 --> 01:33:12.896]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:12.896 --> 01:33:14.818]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:14.818 --> 01:33:16.480]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.142]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:18.142 --> 01:33:22.906]  Live, from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:37.565]  Dan Lyman who heads up InfoWars Europe is doing a super good job covering Davos and all the different no-go zones, Bilderberg, you name it.
[01:33:37.565 --> 01:33:38.746]  Had quite the adventures.
[01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:45.290]  We're trying to get him to get set up to start hiring some more crew because he's been a one-man wrecking ball so far.
[01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:48.012]  He heads up EuropeWars.com.
[01:33:48.012 --> 01:33:48.892]  He's in studio with us.
[01:33:48.892 --> 01:33:50.994]  Great to have you here visiting the ATX, my friend.
[01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:57.236]  We're going to get back to you in a minute and break down just all of the scale of the invasion.
[01:33:57.236 --> 01:33:59.457]  Obviously, the next wave's here.
[01:33:59.457 --> 01:34:04.700]  Macron walking back his statements about bringing in 200 million North Africans.
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:07.642]  Obviously, he's still trying to do it, but now he's having to back off on the statement.
[01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:10.023]  We're going to get to that all here in just a moment.
[01:34:10.023 --> 01:34:12.385]  Breaking news on Infowars.com.
[01:34:12.385 --> 01:34:13.825]  Go away!
[01:34:13.825 --> 01:34:16.667]  Liberals rejecting Hillary 2020 en masse.
[01:34:16.667 --> 01:34:17.868]  Sorry, liberals!
[01:34:19.264 --> 01:34:22.165]  You voted for Bernie, she took the nomination, and she's got billions.
[01:34:22.165 --> 01:34:23.765]  The Democrats are broke.
[01:34:23.765 --> 01:34:26.186]  She owns you.
[01:34:26.186 --> 01:34:27.506]  See those eyes?
[01:34:27.506 --> 01:34:28.667]  She owns you.
[01:34:28.667 --> 01:34:33.448]  It's called a megalomaniac psycho trip.
[01:34:33.448 --> 01:34:37.169]  It's called a power trip, and she owns you, and that's the way it is.
[01:34:37.169 --> 01:34:40.170]  It's a Kit Daniels article.
[01:34:40.170 --> 01:34:41.410]  Also, this is happening more and more.
[01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:43.411]  It's up on Infowars.com from Chris
[01:34:44.844 --> 01:34:55.533]  Manahan from InformationLiberation.com, blogger, rats-out source to aid Mueller witch hunt, media cheers, her breaching all journalistic codes.
[01:34:55.533 --> 01:35:09.284]  And so more and more, I won't talk to Democrat reporters and leftists because they'll lie about what I've said, they'll misrepresent, and they will then, if you do tell them something off-record, they will burn you every time.
[01:35:09.284 --> 01:35:12.787]  They have no standards, you cannot work with them, and they're getting worse.
[01:35:12.787 --> 01:35:13.728]  So that's all coming up.
[01:35:15.247 --> 01:35:25.233]  Obviously, we're going to have extended live coverage tonight, not just until 6 o'clock with The War Room, but right through 8 o'clock Central and after when President Trump makes the announcement of his Supreme Court nominee.
[01:35:25.233 --> 01:35:29.676]  So be sure and know that that's happening tonight and take part in the information warfare.
[01:35:29.676 --> 01:35:33.259]  Spread the live links with everybody you know.
[01:35:33.259 --> 01:35:38.922]  Now, again, before we go to Dan Lyman, just briefly here, it's the second American Revolution sale.

[01:37:08.655 --> 01:37:12.758]  Again, Dan Lyman is an American writer, political analyst, and culture commentator.
[01:37:12.758 --> 01:37:18.601]  After years of fronting a successful rock band, he answered the call to truth journalism and defense of Western civilization.
[01:37:18.601 --> 01:37:20.863]  Dan now serves as foreign correspondent for Infowars.
[01:37:21.623 --> 01:37:27.264]  Europe, and he's at Citizen Analyst on Twitter, at Facebook, at Citizen Analyst as well.
[01:37:27.264 --> 01:37:28.344]  Dan, great to have you here.
[01:37:28.344 --> 01:37:29.305]  Great to be here, thanks.
[01:37:29.305 --> 01:37:31.845]  You've gone to Australia on your own dime.
[01:37:31.845 --> 01:37:33.465]  You've done so much for the fight.
[01:37:33.465 --> 01:37:35.006]  We really appreciate you.
[01:37:35.006 --> 01:37:42.247]  Let's get into what you'd characterize as what's happening in Europe now, the awakening, but also the globalist counter-strike.
[01:37:42.247 --> 01:37:47.348]  They appear to be much bigger than the last battering ram of tens of millions of military-age men.
[01:37:47.948 --> 01:38:04.137]  Well yeah, I mean it seems like we're watching this simultaneous invasion through North America and also in Europe and it's happening at the same time, it's happening in many of the same ways and we were just watching some other stuff back from 2015 and it's like, it's amazing to see this stuff playing out again.
[01:38:04.137 --> 01:38:11.441]  So back then there was about hundreds of thousands that poured into Europe from Africa and from the Middle East through Turkey and also across the Mediterranean route.
[01:38:11.941 --> 01:38:19.506]  And then it kind of cooled off a little bit, supposedly, and now we have a completely new invasion going on across the Mediterranean again.
[01:38:19.506 --> 01:38:26.069]  But of course, Italy is not really as receptive as they were in the past, so it looks like they're using Spain now more often.
[01:38:26.069 --> 01:38:29.511]  And also, they've kind of forged a new route through the Balkans.
[01:38:29.511 --> 01:38:33.594]  There was a previous Balkan route that went up through Macedonia, Serbia, and into Hungary.
[01:38:33.934 --> 01:38:36.116]  That was shut down temporarily.
[01:38:36.116 --> 01:38:37.518]  They found another way to get up through.
[01:38:37.518 --> 01:38:39.079]  They call it the mosque route.
[01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:48.649]  And the foreign minister of Hungary has recently noted that the new surge that he has seen some evidence of could be worse than the 2015.
[01:38:48.649 --> 01:38:52.814]  And I think that, of course, we should have expected that to be coming at some point.
[01:38:52.814 --> 01:38:53.374]  And let's be 100% clear.
[01:38:54.963 --> 01:38:56.983]  This is the admitted U.N.
[01:38:56.983 --> 01:38:57.824]  plan.
[01:38:57.824 --> 01:38:58.244]  The U.N.
[01:38:58.244 --> 01:39:06.885]  says, oh, it's gotten so bad, we'll build the refugee centers in Spain, in France, all over, and then we'll bring the people in and incentivize them, and then the U.N.
[01:39:06.885 --> 01:39:09.546]  will represent them inside your country, and the E.U.
[01:39:09.546 --> 01:39:19.227]  will declare an emergency, and it's going to use its military to block Italy and others from stopping tens of thousands a week pouring in off Soros-owned Zodiac boats.
[01:39:19.227 --> 01:39:21.448]  And when I say that, Soros brags!
[01:39:22.068 --> 01:39:26.029]  He spent 500 million this year alone just on the ferries.
[01:39:26.029 --> 01:39:27.130]  So they call them rescues.
[01:39:27.130 --> 01:39:32.752]  No, the people are being picked up 100 miles off Libya and then they are being brought in.
[01:39:32.752 --> 01:39:39.114]  I mean, imagine every few hours boats landing, literally invasion boats with George Soros.
[01:39:39.114 --> 01:39:39.894]  You can't make this up.
[01:39:40.274 --> 01:39:42.635]  You can't, and there has been some interesting action on that.
[01:39:42.635 --> 01:39:46.757]  I just received a press release from AFD, which is Alternative für Deutschland.
[01:39:46.757 --> 01:39:48.998]  That's kind of the opposition party there.
[01:39:48.998 --> 01:39:52.480]  They're growing very quickly in numbers, and they're growing very powerful.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.922]  They have actually filed criminal charges against some of these NGOs that some of them operate.
[01:39:57.282 --> 01:39:57.462]  I don't
[01:40:21.548 --> 01:40:22.448]  I got it flipped, you're right.
[01:40:22.448 --> 01:40:24.109]  It's 12 miles and then they bring them the 100.
[01:40:24.109 --> 01:40:24.769]  You're right.
[01:40:24.769 --> 01:40:26.189]  It's only like 120 miles out.
[01:40:26.189 --> 01:40:27.290]  You're right.
[01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:29.070]  They bring them out 10 and then they bring them across.
[01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:32.591]  Right, and some of these journeys are just, they boggle the mind in the distance.
[01:40:32.591 --> 01:40:40.293]  When they just came into Spain and Valencia, that was like a 1,000 kilometer journey where they were just off the coast of Libya to start off with.
[01:40:40.293 --> 01:40:44.634]  And a lot of people have pointed out they could have easily have just brought them to Tunis and Tunisia.
[01:40:44.634 --> 01:40:46.175]  And the port there was safe.
[01:40:46.175 --> 01:40:48.035]  It was definitely somewhere that they could have gone.
[01:40:48.035 --> 01:40:49.796]  And let's be clear, when they blew up Qaddafi,
[01:40:50.396 --> 01:40:52.336]  And ruined all that infrastructure he built.
[01:40:52.336 --> 01:41:00.778]  It opened it all up to Central Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, in these huge migration lanes to bring them right into Europe.
[01:41:00.778 --> 01:41:02.919]  And he did warn that that would happen ahead of time.
[01:41:02.919 --> 01:41:17.702]  Another interesting development is that Matteo Salvini has been in Libya meeting with the Libyan government offering to incentivize them to build migrant holding centers, detention centers in the south of Libya, not even at the coast to keep them from even reaching some of the port
[01:41:17.722 --> 01:41:21.944]  And let's be clear, that's a good thing to do because Africa's population is about to double.
[01:41:21.944 --> 01:41:23.184]  It's already astronomical.
[01:41:23.184 --> 01:41:30.168]  If I could pull up the latest census on Africa, our best estimation, we could take 500 million, it wouldn't do anything.
[01:41:30.168 --> 01:41:32.109]  It's just insane.
[01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:33.589]  This will only collapse everything.
[01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:34.970]  We have to stabilize Africa.
[01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:36.049]  Absolutely.
[01:41:36.049 --> 01:41:47.952]  If you've watched the gumball presentation, that tells you everything you need to know about how it's totally impossible to mitigate the issues of the third world without staying strong as countries on our own end.
[01:41:47.952 --> 01:41:49.772]  And that's NumbersUSA.
[01:41:49.772 --> 01:41:50.272]  I believe so.
[01:41:50.272 --> 01:41:50.972]  That's the right one.
[01:41:50.972 --> 01:41:54.413]  We should get NumbersUSA back on, because that's what's crazy.
[01:41:54.413 --> 01:41:58.494]  You read the Globalist Report in 1949 to His Majesty.
[01:41:58.494 --> 01:42:00.454]  The British had it commissioned.
[01:42:00.454 --> 01:42:04.275]  And they said, we need to go in, stabilize, industrialize these countries, and they'll only have two kids.
[01:42:05.469 --> 01:42:08.271]  Because if you believe in overpopulation, it's happened in some areas.
[01:42:08.271 --> 01:42:15.516]  Instead, they go, no, we're just going to balloon their population, then use them as cheap labor, and then later a weapon against the West and reverse colonization.
[01:42:15.516 --> 01:42:17.678]  They've done everything they can.
[01:42:17.678 --> 01:42:23.622]  When you've got people starving in a country to not give them their own science to feed themselves, but to just feed people, then they double.
[01:42:23.622 --> 01:42:24.883]  Then you've got to feed double.
[01:42:24.883 --> 01:42:26.204]  Then you've got to feed double again.
[01:42:26.204 --> 01:42:26.764]  It's impossible.
[01:42:27.685 --> 01:42:30.507]  And what they do to these neighborhoods, they completely change neighborhoods.
[01:42:30.507 --> 01:42:40.994]  I mean, we've seen there's no-go zones all over the place, and they're growing in number, and they get downplayed as a no-go zone, because technically you could walk into them, but you don't want to.
[01:42:40.994 --> 01:42:50.140]  I was just in one in Italy, and I wanted to walk through to get some footage, and I just didn't feel comfortable entering.
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:52.322]  Our crew got death-threaded continually.
[01:42:52.322 --> 01:42:56.745]  I mean, it's almost... I mean, it's actually more dangerous than us being conservative.
[01:43:01.312 --> 01:43:07.036]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:43:07.036 --> 01:43:14.901]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:43:14.901 --> 01:43:18.063]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:43:18.243 --> 01:43:23.530]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:26.294]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:43:26.294 --> 01:43:35.307]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:43:35.447 --> 01:43:47.296]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.

[01:43:57.273 --> 01:44:04.401]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[01:44:04.401 --> 01:44:16.774]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated Prebiotic Fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[01:44:17.495 --> 01:44:28.563]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.

[01:44:58.041 --> 01:45:02.005]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:02.005 --> 01:45:05.308]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:45:05.308 --> 01:45:11.574]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:11.574 --> 01:45:14.336]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:45:15.077 --> 01:45:18.902]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:18.902 --> 01:45:25.370]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:30.335]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:31.075 --> 01:45:35.018]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:45:35.018 --> 01:45:42.204]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:42.204 --> 01:45:47.427]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:47.427 --> 01:45:53.132]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:53.132 --> 01:45:57.095]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:58.263 --> 01:46:03.127]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:46:03.127 --> 01:46:12.595]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:46:12.595 --> 01:46:17.378]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:46:17.378 --> 01:46:25.645]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[01:46:25.745 --> 01:46:28.926]  And give your body the tools it needs to support your body.

[01:46:55.734 --> 01:47:03.970]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:21.736 --> 01:47:27.178]  Dan Lyman who heads up the InfoWars News Bureau and is trying to recruit some great folks over in Europe.
[01:47:27.178 --> 01:47:28.558]  He's very prolific.
[01:47:28.558 --> 01:47:30.539]  He's right in the shotgun with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:47:30.539 --> 01:47:33.659]  We've also got Stan Dayo giving his perspective on world events.
[01:47:33.659 --> 01:47:35.060]  But look at this article.
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:38.581]  Far-right pair banned from Auckland council venues.
[01:47:38.581 --> 01:47:40.861]  They've been just banned from anywhere to speak.
[01:47:40.861 --> 01:47:41.962]  And it's Laura Southern.
[01:47:42.912 --> 01:47:44.074]  Do they call an extremist?
[01:47:44.074 --> 01:47:47.258]  And then Stefan Molyneux, they say you're a cult leader.
[01:47:47.258 --> 01:47:48.860]  You couldn't call Stefan Molyneux the opposite.
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:50.722]  He's like an individualist type guy.
[01:47:50.722 --> 01:47:57.070]  So England's actually physically banning Michael Savage and thousands of others coming in if they criticize radical Islam.
[01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:58.111]  But meanwhile, we'll bring in
[01:47:58.752 --> 01:48:02.215]  Somalis, you name it, from places that are fully failed countries.
[01:48:02.215 --> 01:48:08.560]  And I'm not saying all Somalis are bad people, but statistically one of the highest crime rates, rape rates, suicide attack rates.
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:11.602]  Here's an article on EuropeWars.com.
[01:48:11.602 --> 01:48:16.026]  Somali sentenced to community service for raping Swedish minor.
[01:48:16.026 --> 01:48:19.429]  And that's why Europe Wars is like a clearinghouse for this, because it's like every hour
[01:48:20.109 --> 01:48:24.333]  There's a new one where they're cutting a little baby's head off and the police cover it up.
[01:48:24.333 --> 01:48:25.474]  Too dangerous.
[01:48:25.474 --> 01:48:33.540]  The Postal Service in Sweden is no longer delivering to many large areas of cities to deliver packages to migrant suburbs saying it's too dangerous.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:37.123]  The British government, the UK's issued a warning not to go in these areas.
[01:48:37.123 --> 01:48:38.925]  Just a few years ago, Dan, they were denying this.
[01:48:38.925 --> 01:48:40.666]  So get into the no-go zones.
[01:48:40.666 --> 01:48:41.387]  You've been into them.
[01:48:41.947 --> 01:48:48.330]  I have and I actually have been in them years, a couple years before the real invasion which started in 2015.
[01:48:48.330 --> 01:48:50.611]  They were around long before that.
[01:48:50.611 --> 01:48:58.996]  So I was traveling, I spent a month traveling through Europe in 2012 and I inadvertently ended up staying in a couple of them where I couldn't even believe that it was in Europe.
[01:48:58.996 --> 01:49:08.340]  Hamburg, Germany and then also in Paris and I had never heard of these things, no-go zone or just, I hadn't even heard that Europe had changed so much.
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.521]  I was kind of naive back then.
[01:49:10.081 --> 01:49:12.462]  And we encountered issues in Stockholm, Sweden.
[01:49:12.462 --> 01:49:17.485]  There were Iraqi men who were menacing my wife, and I couldn't believe that I was in Sweden at that time as well.
[01:49:17.485 --> 01:49:19.786]  So, I've just watched this developing over time.
[01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:22.687]  Well, they're also so used to how polite Europeans are.
[01:49:22.687 --> 01:49:28.030]  I can tell you, anywhere in Texas, they don't care if you're a Hispanic guy, black guy, white guy.
[01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:30.451]  Somebody starts menacing your wife, they're going to get their ass kicked.
[01:49:30.851 --> 01:49:37.596]  I mean, I've been in Europe just filming on the street, and then Muslims run up and say, you infidel, turn your camera off, you don't film me.
[01:49:37.596 --> 01:49:41.459]  I'm like, dude, I'm filming the Parliament, sorry you're 100 yards away on the shot.
[01:49:41.459 --> 01:49:44.782]  And then I'm like, they'll start threatening me, and I'll say, well, let's go, then they back off.
[01:49:44.782 --> 01:49:50.046]  But I guess they're so used to Europeans, Swedish men especially, I mean, what are they like?
[01:49:50.751 --> 01:49:53.353]  Well, they can be very intimidating for sure.
[01:49:53.353 --> 01:49:55.555]  I mean, what's up with the European men?
[01:49:55.555 --> 01:49:57.136]  Oh, that's a good question.
[01:49:57.136 --> 01:50:03.881]  You know, I just lived in Iceland last year for a year and I expected this kind of healthy, kind of a Viking culture, very manly.
[01:50:03.881 --> 01:50:06.023]  It is completely not that case at all.
[01:50:06.023 --> 01:50:18.833]  I would say that feminism and cultural Marxism has dulled a lot of guys down and it's just the cool thing to do is to be a soy boy at this point and that's prevalent across Europe until you reach the eastern regions and things are a little bit different over there.
[01:50:19.113 --> 01:50:22.254]  Yeah, why is it the East now that's that's like classical?
[01:50:22.254 --> 01:50:25.615]  I mean, they're like Western Europe we heard about.
[01:50:25.615 --> 01:50:34.397]  I think a lot of them would attribute that to being kind of behind the Iron Curtain for a long time and not being exposed to a lot of things that Western Europe was exposed to.
[01:50:34.397 --> 01:50:37.838]  And they've just been through hard times and they don't want to go back to those hard times.
[01:50:37.838 --> 01:50:42.960]  So when you go to places like Poland and Hungary, they know to reject everything the left tells them.
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:43.400]  Absolutely.
[01:50:44.324 --> 01:50:44.624]  Absolutely.
[01:50:44.624 --> 01:50:50.247]  And there's no perfect place, but these places are far and away better off than a lot of these Western countries.
[01:50:50.247 --> 01:50:53.488]  Well, I've been told by Roger Stone that went and spoke to some of the President's people in Eastern Europe.
[01:50:53.488 --> 01:50:55.569]  He said, Infowars stuff is everywhere.
[01:50:55.569 --> 01:50:57.970]  I'm not bragging, but that's a good ping.
[01:50:57.970 --> 01:51:04.813]  I mean, as an Infowars head of Europe operations, what do you see as far as people's attitudes towards Infowars Trump?
[01:51:05.573 --> 01:51:07.374]  Definitely more pro-Trump.
[01:51:07.374 --> 01:51:13.736]  I encountered a lot of Trump backlash in Iceland when I was living there, and also just in Ireland.
[01:51:13.736 --> 01:51:14.816]  I have family there.
[01:51:14.816 --> 01:51:16.096]  Very anti-Trump.
[01:51:16.096 --> 01:51:25.499]  But once you get into places like Croatia and Slovenia, Hungary, it's a lot more just generally a more conservative-feeling culture.
[01:51:25.499 --> 01:51:28.340]  And they don't like to talk politics as much either.
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:33.602]  People in Western Europe will jump, you know, as soon as they hear you're American, they'll make a Trump joke right away.
[01:51:34.142 --> 01:51:40.785]  And they have no problem saying that because they feel comfortable that they're surrounded with people who think they think all think the same way.
[01:51:40.785 --> 01:51:43.046]  And it's just not the case.
[01:51:43.046 --> 01:51:49.989]  Europe, especially Eastern Europe, is waking up, but we see signs in Germany, France, poll numbers show nationalist common sense is exploding as well.
[01:51:50.828 --> 01:52:20.708]  Absolutely and you know when you look at the polling numbers I just an article recently immigration and terrorism they just dominate when they do these public opinion polls as to what is the issue that is most important to you and and the hierarchy and immigration is number one as it is in in the United States as well of course that's why we have Trump and also you were mentioning Australia New Zealand I was just in Australia as well and they have the same issues in Australia that we have in in Europe and in North America with immigration and the related crime surge
[01:52:20.928 --> 01:52:38.448]  And just what I get feedback from people in Australia and New Zealand, you'd think they're a bunch of soy boy commies, but actually they're more awake than the US or even Eastern Europe from what I've seen, but that's why their government keeps their thumb on them and tries to shut down speech and tries to ridicule it, because they know that they got the tiger by the tail with the Aussies.
[01:52:39.028 --> 01:52:40.428]  Absolutely, definitely.
[01:52:40.428 --> 01:52:46.870]  And like you said, New Zealand's a little more, I don't know if they're more woke, but they just don't have the same issues there yet.
[01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:50.891]  I don't know if they just haven't been pounded with just hardcore amounts of immigration.
[01:52:50.891 --> 01:52:55.872]  We were just in Melbourne, and they said they're doing 150,000 new residents every year.
[01:52:55.872 --> 01:53:00.253]  And of course, a lot of these residents, they're not Australians necessarily moving in from the country.
[01:53:00.333 --> 01:53:02.555]  And the issue is, is we find that they came in and assimilated.
[01:53:02.555 --> 01:53:09.901]  They're brought in, and the left takes control of them, and keeps them disenfranchised, and has no intention of trying to even create an economy for them.
[01:53:09.901 --> 01:53:10.302]  Right.
[01:53:10.302 --> 01:53:13.204]  They always tell us we need these people as workers and as taxpayers.
[01:53:13.204 --> 01:53:20.491]  As we well know, a lot of the migrants that have arrived since 2015 in Europe, at least like 90% of them in many areas, don't have a job.
[01:53:20.491 --> 01:53:21.592]  So of course they're not paying taxes.
[01:53:21.592 --> 01:53:23.974]  I mean, Germany's, the UN's own numbers are 84 to 90.
[01:53:23.974 --> 01:53:24.414]  We see those.
[01:53:27.349 --> 01:53:31.031]  Well, I've read all over that if you try to get a job, then you're deported.
[01:53:31.031 --> 01:53:32.352]  Right, there are stories like that.
[01:53:32.352 --> 01:53:34.714]  If you're a productive migrant, then it's a little bit harder.
[01:53:34.714 --> 01:53:38.576]  That's just like in the United States, when you play by the rules, you immigrate the right way.
[01:53:38.576 --> 01:53:41.999]  It's much harder for you than it is to just show up at the border.
[01:53:41.999 --> 01:53:46.862]  And Trump's just trying to, like Ellis Island, do some checking, make sure you're not a criminal, if you fit in.
[01:53:46.862 --> 01:53:48.303]  I mean, he actually kind of has a...
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:52.542]  Classical Americana view on immigration.
[01:53:52.542 --> 01:53:56.666]  But he says we gotta turn the economy back on, we gotta be boomtown, then we're gonna vet people.
[01:53:56.666 --> 01:53:59.408]  We're not gonna take, you know, mentally ill people, criminals.
[01:53:59.408 --> 01:54:00.729]  Sorry, keep your ass where you're at.
[01:54:01.371 --> 01:54:11.173]  Absolutely, and you have just recently in Italy when I was down there talking to a journalist down there and the town that I was in Turin, which is where Bilderberg was, crawling with migrants.
[01:54:11.173 --> 01:54:12.573]  Like I said, I was staying by one.
[01:54:12.573 --> 01:54:15.974]  I had a thousand migrants that were squatting in one little community.
[01:54:15.974 --> 01:54:24.815]  And he said, how could we possibly be bringing these people in as taxpayers and workers when employment is close to 20% and for the youth is closer to 40%?
[01:54:24.815 --> 01:54:28.096]  So not only... It takes Spain, the youth unemployment is like 60.
[01:54:28.096 --> 01:54:28.776]  Right, exactly.
[01:54:29.096 --> 01:54:37.403]  So not only are you bringing in the new foreign population supposedly to pay the taxes, you're driving out the younger folks, the entrepreneurs, the intelligent people.
[01:54:37.403 --> 01:54:39.245]  Oh, it creates a brain drain.
[01:54:39.245 --> 01:54:42.648]  I mean, just the windmills bankrupted Spain.
[01:54:42.648 --> 01:54:44.990]  And then now they're gonna try to bring in 10 million illegals?
[01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:46.571]  I mean, I was in Italy.
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:58.848]  Under every tree, and there's not very many trees in Rome, under everything there'd be like 30-40 people, feces everywhere, and the locals are just like, oh my god, this is horrible!
[01:54:58.848 --> 01:55:12.099]  I don't care if it was an Indian businessman in a business suit, or you know, some Roman woman with beautiful red hair or whatever, they're all disgusted by it, no matter what color you are, because they're all productive, walking along going, what the hell is this?
[01:55:12.099 --> 01:55:14.621]  No one's even taking care of them, they're just squatting everywhere!
[01:55:14.981 --> 01:55:18.384]  Right, creating piles of trash, like you said, all over the place.
[01:55:18.384 --> 01:55:29.413]  And the videos that come out every single day, you can't even do a story on these things sometimes because it's just like a viral video and it's in Europe somewhere and it's a migrant in a fountain using it as a toilet.
[01:55:29.413 --> 01:55:31.274]  Or you have this video you're rolling right here.
[01:55:31.274 --> 01:55:33.176]  They're always attacking groups.
[01:55:33.176 --> 01:55:34.036]  They attack women.
[01:55:34.036 --> 01:55:35.558]  They attack lonely people.
[01:55:35.558 --> 01:55:38.160]  It's never like a one-on-one.
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.681]  They don't fight fair.
[01:55:39.681 --> 01:55:41.702]  There's a disgust of sexy women
[01:55:42.523 --> 01:55:46.964]  And then remember, in Cologne, the mayor said, she's a feminist, don't wear short miniskirts.
[01:55:46.964 --> 01:55:50.986]  The German women want to go out and be in a beer hall and wear miniskirts, I'm all for it.
[01:55:50.986 --> 01:56:00.769]  But they said, no, sexy German women, it's your fault, you're getting raped and attacked because the Islamists see a sexy woman, they don't think they can get her, so that you kill somebody kicking them downstairs like that.
[01:56:01.169 --> 01:56:01.850]  Right, absolutely.
[01:56:01.850 --> 01:56:05.112]  That girl, I don't know what her recovery was, but she was messed up for a while.
[01:56:05.112 --> 01:56:07.053]  And then everybody else pays the price as well.
[01:56:07.053 --> 01:56:11.916]  Like in Sweden, they just cancelled their largest music festival that they have every year.
[01:56:11.916 --> 01:56:16.459]  That's, you know, Swedish youth and I'm sure Europeans from all around go to these festivals.
[01:56:16.459 --> 01:56:19.241]  Don't you want to beat that guy's butt when he throws that woman down the stairs?
[01:56:19.241 --> 01:56:19.801]  Vile.
[01:56:19.801 --> 01:56:20.262]  Vile.
[01:56:20.262 --> 01:56:21.903]  And this kind of stuff happens all the time.
[01:56:21.903 --> 01:56:25.205]  We just had someone, a migrant, decapitate a baby on a train.
[01:56:25.205 --> 01:56:27.006]  Oh yeah, tell folks about that.
[01:56:27.006 --> 01:56:28.267]  And the police are trying to cover it up.
[01:56:28.487 --> 01:56:29.128]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[01:56:29.128 --> 01:56:30.770]  And they're not letting them report on it.
[01:56:30.770 --> 01:56:33.973]  That was a story that I just caught on the plane on the way over here.
[01:56:33.973 --> 01:56:38.318]  But just vicious attacks all the time, especially on women and kids.
[01:56:38.318 --> 01:56:40.120]  A lot of kids get attacked as well.
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:41.541]  Elderly people.
[01:56:41.541 --> 01:56:46.146]  People over the age of 90 getting sexually assaulted in old folks' homes.
[01:56:46.146 --> 01:56:48.449]  And it's all getting papered over.
[01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:53.153]  We're with the Islamic invaders.
[01:56:53.153 --> 01:56:55.995]  I just keep, every day, what's up with raping 90 year old women?
[01:56:55.995 --> 01:57:00.398]  I'm not going to rape anybody, but what's up with raping, like, women that are half dead?
[01:57:00.398 --> 01:57:01.599]  That sounds gross.
[01:57:01.599 --> 01:57:03.041]  Sounds satanic to me.
[01:57:03.041 --> 01:57:08.105]  And apparently they don't care if it's a young child under the age of 10 or an elderly woman over the age of 90.
[01:57:08.105 --> 01:57:11.487]  So there's something more going on than just the pleasure.
[01:57:11.487 --> 01:57:13.649]  It's just the act of power.
[01:57:13.649 --> 01:57:14.290]  Domination.
[01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:15.851]  Because I don't want to rape a super sexy woman.
[01:57:15.851 --> 01:57:16.511]  That doesn't sound fun.
[01:57:18.971 --> 01:57:21.692]  A 90-year-old woman hooked up on tubes?
[01:57:21.692 --> 01:57:23.073]  Sounds like hell on earth, man.
[01:57:23.073 --> 01:57:23.674]  It's evil.
[01:57:23.674 --> 01:57:24.774]  It's evil.
[01:57:24.774 --> 01:57:25.855]  Definitely.
[01:57:25.855 --> 01:57:27.276]  Well, sorry, we're exposing it.
[01:57:27.276 --> 01:57:28.757]  This all comes out of Soros.
[01:57:28.757 --> 01:57:30.698]  It all comes out of the U.S., their admitted plan.
[01:57:30.698 --> 01:57:31.479]  But guess what?
[01:57:31.479 --> 01:57:33.620]  Your plan ain't working!
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:37.623]  And a lot of the immigrants you brought in are waking up to you, and they don't want to go your route either.
[01:57:37.623 --> 01:57:38.523]  Dan Lyman, stay there.
[01:57:38.523 --> 01:57:43.046]  We'll be back with the third hour, and we've got other surprise guests coming up.
[01:57:43.046 --> 01:57:45.168]  Tomorrow's news today, NewsWars.com.
[01:57:47.315 --> 01:57:57.905]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.905 --> 01:57:59.967]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:57:59.967 --> 01:58:02.850]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:04.331]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.331 --> 01:58:07.474]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:58:07.694 --> 01:58:11.156]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.156 --> 01:58:13.218]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.218 --> 01:58:22.944]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.944 --> 01:58:35.452]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[01:58:35.492 --> 01:58:39.759]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.759 --> 01:58:43.045]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:43.045 --> 01:58:46.671]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:48.581 --> 01:58:50.522]  This 4th of July is special.
[01:58:50.522 --> 01:58:52.522]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[01:58:52.522 --> 01:58:56.964]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[01:58:56.964 --> 01:59:01.325]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[01:59:01.325 --> 01:59:06.427]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[01:59:06.427 --> 01:59:10.148]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[01:59:11.028 --> 01:59:13.309]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[01:59:13.309 --> 01:59:15.250]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[01:59:15.250 --> 01:59:18.411]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[01:59:18.411 --> 01:59:25.554]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[01:59:25.554 --> 01:59:27.415]  We have record sales going on right now.
[01:59:28.419 --> 01:59:30.781]  Free shipping on hundreds of different items.
[01:59:30.781 --> 01:59:34.503]  More than 20 items are 50% off, like Brain Force Plus.
[01:59:34.503 --> 01:59:35.964]  X2 is 40% off.
[01:59:35.964 --> 01:59:38.206]  Knockout Sleep Aid, $17.76.
[01:59:38.206 --> 01:59:41.468]  Silver Bullets, $9.95, a little silver.
[01:59:41.468 --> 01:59:43.510]  And free shipping, you can't beat that.
[01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:46.772]  This Fourth of July is special, and our sales are special to match it.
[01:59:46.772 --> 01:59:51.275]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:59:51.275 --> 01:59:53.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.983 --> 02:00:22.070]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:31.091]  Dan Lyman's in studio with us.
[02:00:31.091 --> 02:00:33.452]  He's going to be popping in throughout the next few days.
[02:00:33.452 --> 02:00:36.354]  He's visiting the Infowars News Center here in Austin, Texas.
[02:00:36.354 --> 02:00:37.575]  He lives in Switzerland.
[02:00:37.575 --> 02:00:39.016]  He heads up Infowars Europe.
[02:00:39.016 --> 02:00:45.119]  Stan Dayo's coming up to get into the Ring of Fire that he's, for years, been predicting would really fire up, and it certainly has.
[02:00:45.119 --> 02:00:51.103]  He also just did a big expedition to the Middle East and Africa, looking for what they believe is the mythical Garden of Eden.
[02:00:51.883 --> 02:00:53.885]  It was written about by all those cultures.
[02:00:53.885 --> 02:00:55.647]  That's coming up with Stan Deo.
[02:00:55.647 --> 02:00:59.231]  We may have an extra special guest popping in as well towards the end of this next hour.
[02:00:59.231 --> 02:01:08.882]  But, that said, we're going to be doing extended live coverage tonight right through 8 o'clock central with Trump's announcement of who the new Supreme Court nominee is.
[02:01:08.882 --> 02:01:11.945]  And we're going to go at least an hour or two into that tonight.
[02:01:12.506 --> 02:01:23.436]  And remember, it's part of the resistance that the live feeds that will be available on satellite to TV and radio, but to you, the listeners and viewers, share those links on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, the live feeds.
[02:01:23.436 --> 02:01:25.458]  That's how we get past the censors.
[02:01:25.458 --> 02:01:27.180]  That's how we get around what they're doing.
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:30.703]  And we're doing it all the time against their shadow bans and all of it.
[02:01:30.703 --> 02:01:31.484]  They get so upset.
[02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:41.223]  Last year, Zuckerberg promising Merkel that he would censor the anti-open borders people.
[02:01:41.223 --> 02:01:42.424]  It hasn't worked.
[02:01:42.424 --> 02:01:46.666]  I don't see a place in Europe where the elections aren't being won by nationalists.
[02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:48.747]  How do you expect the globalists to strike back?
[02:01:48.747 --> 02:01:49.908]  That's a good question.
[02:01:49.908 --> 02:01:52.509]  We see a lot of things happening even in the UK today.
[02:01:52.509 --> 02:01:57.672]  There's been some stuff developing with Theresa May and Brexit where her cabinet is falling apart.
[02:01:58.092 --> 02:02:03.176]  Of course, Merkel just held on by the skin of her teeth to her coalition there in Germany.
[02:02:03.176 --> 02:02:15.746]  So that's actually why I think my only speculation as to why Macron keeps going back and forth about this issue because one minute he's saying let's prepare for 200 million Africans to invade, the next one he's saying we need to build Afri... It's to confuse people.
[02:02:15.746 --> 02:02:17.607]  He's gonna go with the globalist deal.
[02:02:17.607 --> 02:02:18.668]  He's just trying to pacify.
[02:02:18.948 --> 02:02:22.370]  Right, because otherwise they'd probably oust him as well.
[02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:25.452]  His popularity ranking is very, very low right now.
[02:02:25.452 --> 02:02:27.693]  It's, I think, sub 40 if I'm not mistaken.
[02:02:27.693 --> 02:02:30.154]  So people are not happy with the job that he's doing.
[02:02:30.154 --> 02:02:38.059]  Of course, we're going to see... And he'll come over and say he loves Trump and then say nationalist or leprosy, Trump scum, hoping no one doesn't, like, go.
[02:02:38.059 --> 02:02:39.820]  That's the worst thing is to say both things.
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:40.520]  Right.
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:41.181]  He's spineless.
[02:02:41.181 --> 02:02:46.246]  He has really no position other than whatever his overlords tell him the position to have.
[02:02:46.246 --> 02:02:51.351]  But he's kind of one of the last ones that's holding on now at this point because now Merkel is threatened.
[02:02:51.351 --> 02:02:54.294]  Obviously in Sweden we have huge developments with the Swedish Democrats.
[02:02:54.294 --> 02:02:55.415]  They're doing really well.
[02:02:55.415 --> 02:03:02.502]  So we've just watched this wave creep from east to west and now it's like just converging in down on basically on France and Spain.
[02:03:02.882 --> 02:03:03.883]  And I know why.
[02:03:03.883 --> 02:03:04.643]  Brussels.
[02:03:04.643 --> 02:03:05.183]  Exactly.
[02:03:05.183 --> 02:03:06.484]  I know why.
[02:03:06.484 --> 02:03:09.346]  There's such a cultural, historic memory in Eastern Europe.
[02:03:09.346 --> 02:03:13.108]  That's over a hundred Islamic invasions took place.
[02:03:13.108 --> 02:03:16.430]  And then after that, the Nazis came in and the Russians came in.
[02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:18.431]  They've been through so many invasions.
[02:03:18.431 --> 02:03:20.373]  They're in the whole crossroads of the world that
[02:03:21.277 --> 02:03:30.650]  They know, and they understand what's happened before, and they understand that the whole ethos of their nations was defeating the Islamic invasions.
[02:03:30.650 --> 02:03:35.436]  You know, when I was in college, they taught that we invaded in the Crusades, in Hollywood movies.
[02:03:36.938 --> 02:03:37.959]  Show that.
[02:03:37.959 --> 02:03:39.822]  Ridley Scott, you know, makes these movies.
[02:03:39.822 --> 02:03:40.462]  No!
[02:03:40.462 --> 02:03:49.434]  They invaded us for 300 years before we turned the tide when they almost took Germany and Poland and then had to do La Rica and Kista and Spain, everywhere!
[02:03:49.434 --> 02:03:51.517]  We didn't invade the Muslims!
[02:03:51.517 --> 02:03:53.019]  And so that's just the reality!
[02:03:54.358 --> 02:03:59.462]  Absolutely, and that's really the importance of getting these people in power, like Viktor Orban, Matteo Salvini.
[02:03:59.462 --> 02:04:04.206]  They will invoke the true history once they have the platform and they have the support of the people.
[02:04:04.206 --> 02:04:08.510]  And then at that point, I think it'd be a lot harder to get them out for the EU folks.
[02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:13.414]  And as we keep installing more and more of them in Austria now, we have a great government there in Austria.
[02:04:13.414 --> 02:04:16.517]  They do have their work cut out for them, but they're there.
[02:04:16.517 --> 02:04:20.000]  So now they have the support of the people, the movement continues to grow.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.482]  You have Salvini saying he's calling for a League of Leagues.
[02:04:22.922 --> 02:04:25.243]  He's going to start binding all these movements together.
[02:04:25.243 --> 02:04:27.183]  He wants to kind of be the figurehead of that.
[02:04:27.183 --> 02:04:29.604]  It's going to create a huge problem for Brussels.
[02:04:29.604 --> 02:04:36.426]  I think it's starting to basically fracture the entire political spectrum in Europe, just cracking it in half right now.
[02:04:36.426 --> 02:04:41.407]  What's panicsome is the left joining the right, because the left's going, oh my god, we're going to lose the civil safety net.
[02:04:41.407 --> 02:04:43.467]  Exactly, dummies, that's globalist plan.
[02:04:43.467 --> 02:04:49.669]  Dan Laman, I want you to talk about the real history more on the War Room today, and with us tonight during that live broadcast, if you can.
[02:04:49.969 --> 02:04:51.030]  We're back with Stan Dayo.
[02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:52.191]  Dan, great to have you here in person.
[02:04:52.191 --> 02:04:52.491]  Thanks so much.
[02:04:52.491 --> 02:04:53.312]  I'm really impressed with your work.
[02:04:53.312 --> 02:04:53.712]  You're awesome.

[02:06:18.970 --> 02:06:20.852]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[02:06:20.852 --> 02:06:26.076]  It's probably confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[02:06:26.076 --> 02:06:30.840]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:33.502]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[02:06:33.502 --> 02:06:36.505]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[02:06:36.505 --> 02:06:37.866]  It just pancaked.
[02:06:37.866 --> 02:06:42.470]  He took the baby's own incubators and left the children to die on the front lines.
[02:06:43.330 --> 02:06:45.311]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[02:06:45.311 --> 02:06:52.556]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[02:06:52.556 --> 02:06:52.956]  U.F.A.
[02:06:52.956 --> 02:06:55.877]  Is this global governance at last?
[02:06:55.877 --> 02:06:58.459]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[02:06:58.459 --> 02:07:00.920]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:01.621]  Some former U.S.
[02:07:01.621 --> 02:07:03.862]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[02:07:03.862 --> 02:07:07.084]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[02:07:07.344 --> 02:07:12.987]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[02:07:12.987 --> 02:07:14.327]  Russian scum!
[02:07:14.327 --> 02:07:15.328]  He denied everything.
[02:07:15.328 --> 02:07:16.828]  He called it all fake news.
[02:07:16.828 --> 02:07:19.750]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:21.690]  This is a national emergency.
[02:07:21.690 --> 02:07:27.473]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[02:07:27.473 --> 02:07:29.774]  This is a FEMA high-level emergency.
[02:07:30.234 --> 02:07:33.076]  We are at war with Russia.
[02:07:33.076 --> 02:07:38.799]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[02:07:38.799 --> 02:07:41.780]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:44.581]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[02:07:44.581 --> 02:07:49.384]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:07:49.384 --> 02:07:50.965]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:07:52.793 --> 02:08:13.481]  Well, during the whole volcano situation in the Big Island, Kona, record-level earthquakes, the worst I've ever had, since they've been recording it, over 100 years of seismographs, huge lava ejections, as everyone knows, other areas of the Pacific Rim really coming to life.
[02:08:13.481 --> 02:08:18.363]  With Standeo, that I heard, you know, 10 years ago, predicting this would happen, he's an interesting guy, engineer,
[02:08:19.443 --> 02:08:21.685]  Worked on a lot of secret projects, you name it.
[02:08:21.685 --> 02:08:25.948]  But he's been out of the country investigating ancient sites, which is even more interesting.
[02:08:25.948 --> 02:08:29.190]  And where's the old explorer out there?
[02:08:29.190 --> 02:08:32.052]  Because they're still finding new species almost every day.
[02:08:32.052 --> 02:08:33.754]  They're still finding new islands.
[02:08:33.754 --> 02:08:36.216]  We haven't even explored the underseas yet.
[02:08:36.216 --> 02:08:38.477]  We haven't explored much of Siberia.
[02:08:38.477 --> 02:08:44.842]  Humans tend to congregate in areas that have no idea what's going on in the more remote reaches.
[02:08:44.842 --> 02:08:46.883]  So he's going to get into that and so much more.
[02:08:49.205 --> 02:08:59.286]  Stan, I wanted to talk to you first, just as a smart guy and as a fellow Texan here, I think you're still in Texas, with your view on Trump.
[02:09:00.248 --> 02:09:15.999]  On what's happening globally, the moment in history, if you were a historian 100 years from now, looking back on 2018, all the things that's happening, all the tectonic changes, the cultural changes, the galactic changes, as they say, it's as above so below.
[02:09:15.999 --> 02:09:20.883]  I don't describe the whole occult thing, but it's true, as above so below.
[02:09:20.883 --> 02:09:23.204]  Where do you think we are?
[02:09:24.165 --> 02:09:27.487]  In the compendium and the spectrum of human existence.
[02:09:27.487 --> 02:09:31.749]  I feel like at a gut level and see that we're at a jump point or a dying point.
[02:09:31.749 --> 02:09:42.154]  I think we're at a major crossroads and I think humanity and its survival instincts and its spirit is starting to reach for a better future and the globalists are panicking.
[02:09:42.154 --> 02:09:45.536]  But so this is the six, seven minutes we have left of this segment.
[02:09:45.536 --> 02:09:49.478]  How would you, talking to say your grandchildren, describe this moment in history?
[02:09:51.272 --> 02:10:02.578]  Well, if we were all still alive together, I would say that this was the moment that America, the modern Babylon, began its collapse into history.
[02:10:02.578 --> 02:10:13.743]  I think that there are so many things in play at the moment, geophysically and politically, that the United States is going to be destroyed, unless we have some magical way to reverse it.
[02:10:13.743 --> 02:10:15.784]  I just think the whole world is against us at the moment.
[02:10:17.478 --> 02:10:23.623]  And so Trump's like some last-ditch effort of people that aren't complete traitors to try to turn it around?
[02:10:23.623 --> 02:10:24.303]  Yes, yes.
[02:10:24.303 --> 02:10:27.606]  Look, we pray for him every day here in this house, twice a day at least.
[02:10:27.606 --> 02:10:34.451]  And, you know, I marvel that at his age that he's able to handle the fight like he is.
[02:10:34.451 --> 02:10:39.916]  Well, he did take on a challenge worse than Hercules cleaning out the Aegean stables.
[02:10:41.741 --> 02:10:43.602]  Yeah, he did.
[02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:45.784]  It's worse than a swamp.
[02:10:45.784 --> 02:10:51.968]  You know, on our show images page on standeo.com, I'll be referring to some of these images today.
[02:10:51.968 --> 02:11:00.934]  If you go to standeo.com and click on the link, you'll see the link which is under the YouTube sign.
[02:11:00.934 --> 02:11:06.418]  You'll see where it shows, show images next to the microphone.
[02:11:07.216 --> 02:11:08.657]  Alright, you're already there, good.
[02:11:08.657 --> 02:11:09.617]  You're already there.
[02:11:09.617 --> 02:11:16.480]  Okay, go to the image number... Yes, that one.
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:17.420]  I lost my image here.
[02:11:17.420 --> 02:11:18.100]  4748, which one?
[02:11:20.302 --> 02:11:28.127]  Yeah, it's at the very top on the left, the one that's talking about the 31% of American voters think a second Civil War is likely.
[02:11:28.127 --> 02:11:37.894]  And Holly has put a comment under there, because about 20 years ago we visited with the Hobies in Shangopo Village, the second Mesa.
[02:11:38.534 --> 02:11:44.178]  And they told us some prophetic utterances that they had for their people and for the United States.
[02:11:44.178 --> 02:11:49.581]  And at that time, they told us that there's going to be a massive civil war based on... I remember you... How long ago was that?
[02:11:49.581 --> 02:11:51.702]  Was that even with Art Bell or Coast to Coast?
[02:11:51.702 --> 02:11:52.963]  When did I hear you talk about that?
[02:11:52.963 --> 02:11:54.284]  It was like 15, 20 years ago?
[02:11:54.284 --> 02:11:55.565]  When was that?
[02:11:55.565 --> 02:11:58.927]  Oh, at least 2001, I think it was.
[02:11:58.927 --> 02:12:01.588]  I remember you... Oh my gosh.
[02:12:01.588 --> 02:12:05.051]  I remember you talking about that and thinking that was wild.
[02:12:05.051 --> 02:12:05.991]  So go back to that.
[02:12:05.991 --> 02:12:07.072]  So the Hopis told you that?
[02:12:07.813 --> 02:12:09.753]  Yeah, they did.
[02:12:09.753 --> 02:12:12.554]  They're well known to be very psychic.
[02:12:12.554 --> 02:12:15.775]  Well, yeah, they seem to have the knowledge of the people.
[02:12:15.775 --> 02:12:18.416]  They call the North American Indians the people.
[02:12:18.416 --> 02:12:20.836]  And they're the prophecy keepers for them.
[02:12:20.836 --> 02:12:22.397]  Very peaceful people.
[02:12:22.397 --> 02:12:23.937]  I loved them to death.
[02:12:23.937 --> 02:12:27.758]  I could look in their eyes and see just honesty.
[02:12:27.758 --> 02:12:33.199]  It's something we don't see so much here in the modern world out here.
[02:12:33.199 --> 02:12:36.580]  But anyway, they looked me in the eye, and this particular one,
[02:12:37.245 --> 02:12:38.387]  I don't know.
[02:12:46.855 --> 02:12:51.898]  Soon there will be water flowing between here and we will go by canoe between the mesas.
[02:12:51.898 --> 02:12:56.901]  And then we will go by land after America has fallen in the Civil War.
[02:12:56.901 --> 02:12:59.523]  We will take groups of the survivors with us.
[02:12:59.523 --> 02:13:07.707]  They will come down to us and we will march up into the three corners or four corners area near Colorado or in Colorado and form a new nation of man.
[02:13:07.707 --> 02:13:10.289]  And that was kind of the basis of the whole prophecy.
[02:13:10.849 --> 02:13:11.210]  We're good to go.
[02:13:24.087 --> 02:13:41.435]  Well, from just studying things, the globalists have invested in China, they plan to use that economically, militarily to do it, but just on Monday, or I guess it was Friday, it's Monday now, it came out, Chinese government documents, that they're encircling us, they're economically cutting us off, working with big banks,
[02:13:41.795 --> 02:13:45.798]  And working for a civil war to collapse the country.
[02:13:45.798 --> 02:13:52.643]  And so that's pretty nightmarish because they got a billion, four hundred million people, they own our debt, and they've got traders working for them.
[02:13:52.643 --> 02:13:54.804]  I don't think the Democrats on average understand.
[02:13:54.804 --> 02:13:57.446]  They are literally working for big banks in communist China.
[02:13:57.446 --> 02:13:58.207]  Talk about traders!
[02:13:59.506 --> 02:14:02.108]  You know, it's an interesting point.
[02:14:02.108 --> 02:14:13.798]  Sun Tzu, Articles of War, does say that China, let's use China as the aggressor at this point, is wise in letting its enemies beat themselves to death and then march in and pick up the pieces.
[02:14:13.798 --> 02:14:24.046]  So in respect of where we are now, China is fueling the fire between Russia, North Korea as well, but Saudi Arabia and some of the Arabian nations.
[02:14:25.227 --> 02:14:28.549]  They're fueling that so that we will beat ourselves to death in the Middle East.
[02:14:28.549 --> 02:14:38.195]  And when we've weakened our resources and our armies there, then it's when China will come in and sweep in and try to take all the oil fields and control the energy of the planet from the Middle East.
[02:14:38.195 --> 02:14:47.200]  And that fits with the revelation prophecy about the kings, the 200 million men army of kings of the East coming into the Battle of Armageddon there in the Megiddo Plain of northern Israel.
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:47.921]  We're there.
[02:14:47.921 --> 02:14:49.422]  We're approaching it like gangbusters.
[02:14:49.662 --> 02:14:53.585]  Because there weren't 200 million people at the time of that prophecy 2,000 years ago.
[02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:57.388]  But now there are, and that's exactly what the military is.
[02:14:57.388 --> 02:15:01.372]  And they're actually in these documents training, as you said, to cut off all the resources.
[02:15:01.372 --> 02:15:05.035]  As you know, all the big Chinese companies from Africa to Latin America, the Middle East.
[02:15:05.855 --> 02:15:09.318]  Are, and notice under Bush and the whole Iraq invasion, we gave it to China.
[02:15:09.318 --> 02:15:10.138]  We didn't get any of that oil.
[02:15:10.138 --> 02:15:12.400]  That's what Trump's talked about.
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:16.844]  Their so-called workers are all military, and they're run by intelligence operatives.
[02:15:16.844 --> 02:15:20.867]  It even came out, even the Washington Post admits most are public universities.
[02:15:20.867 --> 02:15:23.309]  The Communist Chinese have already gotten control of them.
[02:15:23.309 --> 02:15:25.670]  They've got the Office of Personnel Management hack.
[02:15:25.670 --> 02:15:34.097]  I mean, we're basically already been defeated by China, and Trump is desperately trying to get back control, and all these traitorous Americans are absolutely against it.
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:35.581]  I know.
[02:15:35.581 --> 02:15:36.021]  It's sad.
[02:15:36.021 --> 02:15:36.962]  It really is sad.
[02:15:36.962 --> 02:15:40.266]  It's just frustrating to watch this happen.
[02:15:40.266 --> 02:15:43.130]  It's a slow motion collapse of the new Roman Empire.
[02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:44.171]  That's us.
[02:15:44.171 --> 02:15:51.179]  And then Trump's desperately trying to stop it and the fools that will be destroyed by this are trying to stop him from saving them.
[02:15:51.179 --> 02:15:51.540]  We'll be back.
[02:15:55.339 --> 02:15:59.581]  Now there's a proven powerful anti-inflammatory that absorbs 40 times better.

[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:24.861]  Collapse.
[02:20:24.861 --> 02:20:25.941]  Race war.
[02:20:25.941 --> 02:20:28.543]  That's the globalist plan.
[02:20:28.543 --> 02:20:29.544]  That's the UN plan.
[02:20:33.152 --> 02:20:35.817]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:35.817 --> 02:20:41.749]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:20:41.749 --> 02:20:44.615]  But, the world is being given a chance at a reprieve.
[02:20:46.226 --> 02:20:47.126]  That's the way history works.
[02:20:47.126 --> 02:20:48.727]  It's what God's always done.
[02:20:48.727 --> 02:20:49.368]  Will we take it?
[02:20:49.368 --> 02:20:50.368]  Stan Dayos here with us.
[02:20:50.368 --> 02:20:54.590]  I want to get into his archaeological mission and some of the amazing things he's done in the next segment.
[02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:57.492]  Briefly, we'll get into four more of the boys.
[02:20:57.492 --> 02:21:00.734]  That's 12 now, so there's two more on their coach they have to get out.
[02:21:00.734 --> 02:21:02.254]  One diver's died.
[02:21:02.254 --> 02:21:05.056]  Two divers going in through this huge cave system.
[02:21:05.056 --> 02:21:05.636]  It's flooded.
[02:21:05.636 --> 02:21:08.678]  It's just incredibly heroic stuff.
[02:21:08.678 --> 02:21:10.639]  That's a question, though, that we'll get to next segment.
[02:21:12.318 --> 02:21:15.519]  The globalists will say abort babies, don't care about old people, euthanize them.
[02:21:15.519 --> 02:21:19.821]  But when we see humans trapped in a bad position, we empathize, we want to save them.
[02:21:19.821 --> 02:21:22.162]  So that's the instinct of survival.
[02:21:22.162 --> 02:21:27.224]  What about all of us on this planet with the rising water of globalism and communism and tyranny?
[02:21:27.224 --> 02:21:30.946]  Let's just cover the boys now and then get into the volcanoes and the trip.
[02:21:30.946 --> 02:21:33.767]  Since I mentioned it, I always say it's coming up, but I can never do that.
[02:21:33.767 --> 02:21:35.408]  Stan, I mean, what does this bring up in you?
[02:21:36.997 --> 02:21:45.785]  Watching this heroic stuff happen, those divers going into those caves that are flooded full of mud and debris, it's amazing.
[02:21:48.493 --> 02:21:58.521]  It is amazing, and it reinforces my beliefs that there are people in our world that still have compassion, you know, to help their fellow man.
[02:21:58.521 --> 02:22:02.704]  In this case, two people have already laid down their lives to save these boys.
[02:22:02.704 --> 02:22:17.296]  And, you know, you read the report, the statistic, you know, two of the rescuers die, and okay, then you read the rest of the article and kind of forget about it, but those rescuers had people, families, lives, and they've laid that all on the line for these young
[02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:19.091]  Soccer players.
[02:22:19.091 --> 02:22:25.134]  And I just think it's marvelous to see that in a world that's so full of hatred and conflict.
[02:22:25.134 --> 02:22:27.135]  And these guys aren't just all Thai.
[02:22:27.135 --> 02:22:32.277]  The rescuers came in from a lot of places to help.
[02:22:32.277 --> 02:22:43.282]  And the courage it takes to go into a black water flooded hole and then to have the courage to try to bring a child out who isn't even scuba certified.
[02:22:43.282 --> 02:22:44.843]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:22:47.361 --> 02:22:49.282]  The whole world is watching this, it really is.
[02:22:49.282 --> 02:22:58.067]  I just marvel at this whole operation and I'm so glad, so thankful that the children at least are being saved like this.
[02:22:58.067 --> 02:23:08.373]  I tell you, it just comes to that point, because I've read about ships that have jumped over and stuff and people have to swim like 50 yards out through the bulkheads, they can't see what's happening.
[02:23:08.373 --> 02:23:10.775]  And they'll kind of wait until the end as the water's rising.
[02:23:12.363 --> 02:23:12.623]  Yeah, I know.
[02:23:12.623 --> 02:23:18.008]  I don't know how it would feel to be down in such a cramped space so far underground, you know, with the water just rising up and the monsoon season starting.
[02:23:40.899 --> 02:23:45.121]  Yeah, you know, the change in the weight of the water on the structures around it might cause cave-ins.
[02:23:45.121 --> 02:23:47.882]  I mean, there's just all kinds of problems that could happen.
[02:23:47.882 --> 02:23:50.504]  And in spite of all that, these guys have gone down there and made it work.
[02:23:50.504 --> 02:23:53.665]  And some of these spaces are three feet wide with the gear and all of it.
[02:23:53.665 --> 02:23:56.046]  Talk about claustrophobia.
[02:23:56.046 --> 02:23:59.788]  And, you know, trying to get through with your oxygen tank on your back and a child with you.
[02:23:59.788 --> 02:24:00.949]  I mean, it's a tight squeeze.
[02:24:00.949 --> 02:24:05.451]  You don't want to rip any hoses loose and, you know, hurt the child or yourself.
[02:24:05.451 --> 02:24:06.751]  Yeah, it's a challenge.
[02:24:06.751 --> 02:24:08.452]  And my hat's off to those guys.
[02:24:08.452 --> 02:24:10.013]  I don't know that I'd be able to do that.
[02:24:12.252 --> 02:24:13.293]  It's amazing.
[02:24:13.293 --> 02:24:16.554]  And you look at the lazy trendies and how hateful they are and cowardly.
[02:24:16.554 --> 02:24:19.575]  I mean, you know they'd never do that for anybody.
[02:24:19.575 --> 02:24:20.575]  No, no.
[02:24:20.575 --> 02:24:31.559]  This generation today, the millennial generation and kind of their offspring, are a real disappointment to the founding fathers of this country and to people in my generation and yours.
[02:24:31.559 --> 02:24:37.101]  I'm just so sad to see that they've been steered in such a terrible direction.
[02:24:37.101 --> 02:24:37.661]  Absolutely.
[02:24:40.117 --> 02:24:44.119]  Let's go ahead and get into the tectonic stuff that's happening on the planet.
[02:24:44.119 --> 02:24:57.768]  You accurately predicted decades ago with your own system looking at these seismic charts they had about what was really going on and different theories just like astrophysicists can accurately predict what's gonna happen the weather much better than regular
[02:24:59.372 --> 02:25:00.874]  Weathermen are women.
[02:25:00.874 --> 02:25:02.616]  Meteorologists, because they only look at the planet.
[02:25:02.616 --> 02:25:06.301]  Well, obviously, the sun, the moon, the solar winds, that has a bigger effect.
[02:25:06.301 --> 02:25:11.387]  So you looked at other things with your own theorems that have ended up to be very, very accurate.
[02:25:11.387 --> 02:25:14.971]  So where is the Earth now in its tectonic behavior?
[02:25:14.971 --> 02:25:16.653]  There's something weird going on at the moment.
[02:25:19.645 --> 02:25:21.607]  Month and a half, two months, I guess.
[02:25:21.607 --> 02:25:27.111]  The earthquake numbers in the Richter 5 and above have dropped 21%.
[02:25:27.111 --> 02:25:32.456]  So when earthquakes in that range don't happen, it's a sign that pressure is building up somewhere.
[02:25:32.456 --> 02:25:35.218]  It's not a sign that earthquakes decided to take a vacation.
[02:25:35.218 --> 02:25:39.321]  It is the pressure is building up and not releasing in these smaller earthquakes.
[02:25:39.321 --> 02:25:47.448]  Now, if you can look at my show images page there at image 43, that's a graph, and click it up.
[02:25:48.419 --> 02:25:52.761]  You'll see the drop in the Richter 5 earthquakes.
[02:25:52.761 --> 02:26:00.384]  Now, in this map, I have not included 37 earthquakes, Richter 5 or better, that occurred under Kilauea.
[02:26:00.384 --> 02:26:05.866]  Kilauea has had over, gosh, 4,800 earthquakes from Richter 1 up in the last 8 weeks.
[02:26:05.866 --> 02:26:07.247]  So, yeah, there you go.
[02:26:07.247 --> 02:26:08.067]  That's the graph.
[02:26:14.691 --> 02:26:20.478]  So I think that what we're seeing planet wide is a change in the pressures on the surface.
[02:26:20.478 --> 02:26:29.188]  We may be building up for some really big earthquakes and I sense from what the government, USGS, has been telling people in California and the West Coast
[02:26:30.728 --> 02:26:36.374]  That we may be seeing the big one or several big ones occur along the west coast of the United States.
[02:26:36.374 --> 02:26:43.161]  My guess at this moment is that we'll see the first release at the southern end of the San Andreas Fault near the Salton Sea.
[02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:43.761]  There you go.
[02:26:43.761 --> 02:26:44.182]  There you go.
[02:26:44.182 --> 02:26:46.364]  That's a good image from our site there.
[02:26:48.116 --> 02:27:03.611]  Uh, and you know, when officialdom starts to kind of agree with what I'm saying on this kind of stuff, I begin to think we are close, because they try not to panic people unnecessarily, but at the same time, doing their job, they want to give you some warning.
[02:27:03.611 --> 02:27:08.155]  And isn't that plate that comes into California way overdue for the big one?
[02:27:11.540 --> 02:27:15.281]  is north of the Northern California, Oregon and Washington Coast.
[02:27:15.281 --> 02:27:17.702]  That's the the Juan de Fuca plate.
[02:27:17.702 --> 02:27:27.185]  And it is like 55 years now overdue for a massive nine point plus earthquake, creating tidal waves and a lot of damage on the shore.
[02:27:27.185 --> 02:27:28.465]  So yes, it is overdue.
[02:27:28.465 --> 02:27:30.326]  And we need to be conscious of that.
[02:27:32.397 --> 02:27:38.581]  I gotta tell you, California's kind of, their vote, I wouldn't mind losing their political votes at the moment.
[02:27:38.581 --> 02:27:46.245]  If the earthquakes happen and break it up into islands, like they say, they'll be so busy surviving that they won't be able to influence the elections so much the way they have been.
[02:27:46.245 --> 02:27:48.407]  Not to tell Hollywood a few things.
[02:27:48.407 --> 02:27:55.071]  It is funny though that it's the big anti-American state now, and it's the one even mainline geologists say might disappear, but moving more east.
[02:27:55.811 --> 02:27:59.194]  What about the Mega Caldera there at Yellowstone?
[02:27:59.194 --> 02:28:06.542]  Because I remember you 20 years ago saying it was starting to come back to life and now even Mainline Science says it's doing some weird stuff.
[02:28:06.542 --> 02:28:07.803]  Yeah, it's kind of...
[02:28:08.607 --> 02:28:12.689]  Good to be right, I guess, but not really, because it's actually happening.
[02:28:12.689 --> 02:28:18.331]  They have found, since I started talking about it, an extra magma chamber underneath it, which none of us knew was there.
[02:28:18.331 --> 02:28:25.253]  So, there's the Yellowstone Caldera and the one down in the North Island of New Zealand at the Lake Taupo Caldera.
[02:28:25.253 --> 02:28:28.735]  Those two are of great concern and will probably convert fairly soon.
[02:28:29.642 --> 02:28:31.944]  Let's talk about that and then get into your amazing trip.
[02:28:31.944 --> 02:28:33.365]  I hope a film's getting made.

[02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:16.902]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[02:33:16.902 --> 02:33:19.884]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[02:33:19.884 --> 02:33:24.586]  In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry.
[02:33:24.586 --> 02:33:28.188]  I wish I lived back in the woods.
[02:33:28.188 --> 02:33:31.270]  The interest is up and the stock market's down.
[02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:34.192]  And you're only gettin' mugged if you go downtown.
[02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:47.430]  Sorry, saying woman hurts other people's feelings.
[02:33:47.430 --> 02:33:49.891]  Don't use that term.
[02:33:49.891 --> 02:33:51.832]  Democrats said so.
[02:33:51.832 --> 02:33:56.113]  Can't say boy either.
[02:33:56.113 --> 02:33:57.193]  Some people aren't boys.
[02:33:57.193 --> 02:33:59.054]  That's what they teach in Canada.
[02:33:59.054 --> 02:34:00.614]  That's what they teach in the U.S.
[02:34:00.614 --> 02:34:03.355]  That's how far we've come in this cult of lunatics.
[02:34:05.625 --> 02:34:08.986]  What they want is a bunch of domesticated idiots.
[02:34:08.986 --> 02:34:10.206]  Stan Dayo is our guest.
[02:34:10.206 --> 02:34:11.887]  I really appreciate him joining us.
[02:34:11.887 --> 02:34:13.107]  We have a special guest joining us.
[02:34:13.107 --> 02:34:14.527]  I'm going to tell you about in the next segment.
[02:34:14.527 --> 02:34:19.388]  But I'm going to have Stan back very, very soon to get more into his discoveries and what he's done.
[02:34:19.388 --> 02:34:26.570]  But just in the 10 minutes we have now, dare2prepare.com, standayo.com, Stan, finishing up with
[02:34:27.426 --> 02:34:32.570]  The super caldera that we know has erupted before.
[02:34:32.570 --> 02:34:33.691]  They've got ash maps.
[02:34:33.691 --> 02:34:35.393]  It's the USGS.
[02:34:35.393 --> 02:34:36.153]  It's not debatable.
[02:34:36.153 --> 02:34:38.155]  It covers most of the US.
[02:34:38.155 --> 02:34:42.159]  And then they say that it's basically due, maybe now, maybe in 100 years.
[02:34:42.159 --> 02:34:45.121]  I mean, you don't know time-wise, but just the different changes there.
[02:34:45.121 --> 02:34:51.927]  Then let's get into your big expedition that we're going to have you back on for a full hour about soon, looking for the Garden of Eden.
[02:34:53.541 --> 02:34:55.001]  Well, there have been a couple of things going on.
[02:34:55.001 --> 02:35:01.784]  Oh, by the way, I noticed you've got a beard since the last time we were talking, and being partial to beards myself, I like yours.
[02:35:01.784 --> 02:35:02.624]  It's great.
[02:35:02.624 --> 02:35:03.924]  Yours looks good, too, my friend.
[02:35:03.924 --> 02:35:05.005]  Thank you.
[02:35:05.005 --> 02:35:05.765]  I like it.
[02:35:05.765 --> 02:35:17.049]  Anyway, yeah, in May of this year, the last two weeks of it, my partner and I and one of my businesses, the Black Sea Jewelers, we flew over to Tanzania to prove that the
[02:35:17.729 --> 02:35:18.330]  We're good.
[02:35:34.787 --> 02:35:35.107]  I think?
[02:35:55.047 --> 02:36:10.331]  And it was there, it was full of water, and it was one of two that we found at the top, which proved that the whole Ngoro Plateau, and particularly the Ngoro Crater, was the Garden of Eden, and of the biblical account and many other ancient accounts.
[02:36:10.331 --> 02:36:22.715]  We were just able to do this by putting the world back together in a computer, where all the continents touched each other in the Pangaea type arrangement, and then we were able to trace all these rivers spoken of by Moses in the Genesis account.
[02:36:24.374 --> 02:36:28.835]  And that led also to other things as far as archaeological finds.
[02:36:28.835 --> 02:36:31.636]  I was able to find Atlantis after that.
[02:36:31.636 --> 02:36:40.098]  We located the Eden Complex and then the Atlantis situation, but you can see that on my YouTube channel, the Atlantis discussion.
[02:36:40.098 --> 02:36:41.898]  And, you know, we can talk next time, too.
[02:36:41.898 --> 02:36:48.800]  I've got another business that we started to make EMP shields for houses and all the stuff in your house.
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:52.221]  And my partner, Tim Carty, and I have been setting up
[02:36:52.808 --> 02:37:09.060]  Well, I think we've got about 35 products now based on shielding generators, solar collectors, diesel generators, gas generators, and your home from the pulse of an electronic magnetic pulse from a bomb.
[02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:09.921]  Oh, I understand.
[02:37:09.921 --> 02:37:13.924]  You're not talking about an EMF shield just for like regular stuff?
[02:37:13.924 --> 02:37:14.665]  No, no, no, no.
[02:37:14.665 --> 02:37:17.627]  You mean a capacitor type systems actually block it in the chain?
[02:37:18.667 --> 02:37:24.952]  It takes the sudden rise in voltage from an EMP attack, or a pulse, whether it comes from the sun or from an enemy.
[02:37:24.952 --> 02:37:30.115]  It takes that, which generates huge high voltages, and just would fry all your electronics and stuff.
[02:37:30.115 --> 02:37:30.696]  No, no, I understand.
[02:37:30.696 --> 02:37:31.556]  I hadn't had time to look at it.
[02:37:31.556 --> 02:37:35.719]  I want to talk to you, so let's get on the phone and talk about it, because that's very exciting to talk about that.
[02:37:35.719 --> 02:37:46.347]  Now, expanding on this, though, you're looking at a model that Pangea didn't have in over billions of years, but that the continents were together, and that we're actually an accelerated Earth.
[02:37:46.347 --> 02:37:47.228]  And I used to hear that
[02:37:48.556 --> 02:37:54.921]  25 years ago and think, oh, mainline science is right, but they keep admitting it's not right, and they keep admitting that.
[02:37:54.921 --> 02:37:55.722]  What is an example?
[02:37:55.722 --> 02:38:03.067]  I interviewed the other member of the Shoemaker-Levy, who discovered the comet first and all the rest of it.
[02:38:03.067 --> 02:38:07.951]  They talked about how now they know there's thousands of giant meteor strikes all over the Earth.
[02:38:07.951 --> 02:38:09.992]  Previously, they thought they were happening every few million years.
[02:38:09.992 --> 02:38:14.396]  Now they know it's happening a lot quicker than that, maybe every thousand, two, three thousand.
[02:38:14.396 --> 02:38:15.917]  A lot of ancient cultures write about that.
[02:38:17.054 --> 02:38:21.458]  And that the tectonic activity isn't gradual, like they say, it's explosive.
[02:38:21.458 --> 02:38:33.247]  And then if you do put all those things back together, and look at the Sumerian text, the Egyptian text, the Jewish text, as you said, it actually is the world together in a different thing and accelerated, which has been proven...
[02:38:34.352 --> 02:38:34.492]  Yes.
[02:38:50.632 --> 02:38:59.097]  Where it's not happening every once in a while, just like we saw what 1918, you know, over Russia, that giant thing that blew up, destroyed tens of thousands of square miles of stuff.
[02:38:59.097 --> 02:39:00.318]  Thank God it was unpopulated.
[02:39:00.318 --> 02:39:09.564]  So, looking at that model, just in a few minutes, you'll come back for a full hour, describe the model you're saying of a younger Earth system that more and more science is showing.
[02:39:10.902 --> 02:39:21.611]  Okay, even the Big Bang theory lends credence to the Young Earth, the Young Universe theory or hypothesis at this point.
[02:39:21.611 --> 02:39:30.518]  Because in the beginning when the Big Bang occurred, all the mass of the entire universe that we can detect was crammed down into this very, very tiny little ball.
[02:39:30.518 --> 02:39:38.384]  And as it expanded within milliseconds, the light speed and all the electromagnetic waves that came out of it
[02:39:39.331 --> 02:39:44.332]  traveled much faster than they do now because space was more dense.
[02:39:44.332 --> 02:40:00.715]  And if you calculate it, which Barry Sutterfield has done on his website here and some papers he's written, if you calculate, you'll see that the speed of light at the Big Bang was 10 with 60 zeros behind it faster than now.
[02:40:00.715 --> 02:40:06.876]  And that's how we carbon date stuff, how we radiometrically date stuff with whatever gases or compounds we use.
[02:40:07.759 --> 02:40:15.840]  When you plug this in, this variable speed of light in, it reduces the age of the universe down to like measured in tens of thousands of years.
[02:40:16.897 --> 02:40:20.419]  And it's just how Revelation says God will then crush it all into a scroll.
[02:40:20.419 --> 02:40:22.160]  It's like, here's the universe, crush it again.
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:23.741]  It's a new thing.
[02:40:23.741 --> 02:40:26.982]  And then it slows down, slow, slow, slow, like any explosion.
[02:40:26.982 --> 02:40:37.488]  And then it doesn't have energy to come back together, but the Creator goes... And now you see all these top scientists and the owners of big banks, the occultists now go, look, we've redone the dark matter.
[02:40:37.488 --> 02:40:38.589]  Something's holding it together.
[02:40:38.589 --> 02:40:39.509]  It's all a simulation.
[02:40:39.509 --> 02:40:44.932]  It's all artificial to make us think, oh, that it's all a simulation given to their new simulation.
[02:40:44.932 --> 02:40:46.353]  So they're all capitulating
[02:40:46.713 --> 02:40:50.215]  Right now and admitting that what we've been told isn't true.
[02:40:50.215 --> 02:40:50.915]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:40:50.915 --> 02:41:05.364]  Look, once you make this change to the timeline, then you could see how the small Earth or the expanding Earth theory works as well, because the Earth was roughly 25% smaller in diameter before the Great Flood.
[02:41:05.364 --> 02:41:07.605]  And I found what caused the Great Flood was at least
[02:41:10.369 --> 02:41:20.713]  And that's why they all describe in every culture that was there that all the water came out of the earth because there's such giant aquifers and the earth's being smashed and all the magma's pushing it out.
[02:41:20.713 --> 02:41:23.614]  You're going to have floods, waters that come out of the ground.
[02:41:23.614 --> 02:41:24.934]  You're going to have rain.
[02:41:24.934 --> 02:41:26.335]  Well, they didn't have rain to start with.
[02:41:26.335 --> 02:41:29.616]  It used to be dew coming up at night to water everything on the planet.
[02:41:29.616 --> 02:41:37.619]  When the asteroid hit and vaporized so much of the sea, it went up into the upper atmosphere, made clouds for the first time, and condensed.
[02:41:37.619 --> 02:41:38.639]  Created terraforming.
[02:41:40.210 --> 02:41:41.090]  Yeah, and it was rain.
[02:41:41.090 --> 02:41:45.611]  That was the rain of the 40 days that they spoke of in Noah's account.
[02:41:45.611 --> 02:41:56.074]  And the oil companies over there in the area... They admit now in models of, say, a 20-mile asteroid hitting in the middle of the Pacific, they say it would make there be floods for years, a dark winter, you name it.
[02:41:56.074 --> 02:42:02.055]  It would be tsunami-type floods, too, because the impact would cause the swishing of all the oceans around the planet.
[02:42:02.055 --> 02:42:08.037]  It would just go and sweep animals and trees and everything into swirling death traps, and that's what we find.
[02:42:09.363 --> 02:42:17.785]  Well, if you look at that, though, and you look at the erosion maps, I think clearly, we don't know.
[02:42:17.785 --> 02:42:20.005]  The official story we've been told is not accurate.
[02:42:20.005 --> 02:42:21.366]  I mean, how could they even know anyways?
[02:42:21.366 --> 02:42:24.346]  Clearly, something else happened.
[02:42:24.346 --> 02:42:25.827]  They have to have an open mind.
[02:42:25.827 --> 02:42:32.908]  They should be really scientists and look at other hypotheses that come up to say, we can explain part of the things you can't.
[02:42:32.908 --> 02:42:33.868]  Let's talk together.
[02:42:33.868 --> 02:42:35.689]  Let's get to the truth.
[02:42:35.689 --> 02:42:36.489]  That's what we're trying to do.
[02:42:37.279 --> 02:42:38.520]  Absolutely, Standeo.
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:40.162]  Thank you so much, Standeo.com.
[02:42:40.162 --> 02:42:41.003]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:42:41.003 --> 02:42:41.803]  Fascinating.
[02:42:41.803 --> 02:42:43.625]  I want to get into this trip to Africa.
[02:42:43.625 --> 02:42:51.352]  All right, we'll be back with a very special guest that got demonized by a certain little nasty lying CNN reporter.
[02:42:51.352 --> 02:42:54.255]  I know most of them are liars, so that kind of widens the field, but you'll see.
[02:42:54.255 --> 02:42:57.738]  InfoWars Live is launching its newest product.
[02:42:57.738 --> 02:42:59.900]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:02.703]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:43:03.815 --> 02:43:15.320]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:24.424]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[02:43:24.924 --> 02:43:30.711]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[02:43:30.711 --> 02:43:36.138]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[02:43:36.138 --> 02:43:38.421]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[02:43:38.421 --> 02:43:40.423]  Bought these, sold out in a month.
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:42.001]  Living in Volcano.
[02:43:56.562 --> 02:43:59.183]  May sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:59.183 --> 02:44:02.464]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:44:02.464 --> 02:44:05.285]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater.
[02:44:05.285 --> 02:44:08.747]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:08.747 --> 02:44:11.508]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:44:12.248 --> 02:44:16.072]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:16.072 --> 02:44:22.540]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.540 --> 02:44:27.505]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.263 --> 02:44:32.184]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:44:32.184 --> 02:44:39.386]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.386 --> 02:44:44.588]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:44.588 --> 02:44:50.290]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.290 --> 02:44:54.271]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:56.567 --> 02:44:58.528]  This 4th of July is special.
[02:44:58.528 --> 02:45:00.508]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[02:45:00.508 --> 02:45:04.950]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[02:45:04.950 --> 02:45:09.311]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[02:45:09.311 --> 02:45:14.413]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[02:45:14.413 --> 02:45:18.154]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[02:45:19.014 --> 02:45:21.297]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[02:45:21.297 --> 02:45:23.259]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[02:45:23.259 --> 02:45:26.402]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[02:45:26.402 --> 02:45:33.549]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.
[02:45:33.549 --> 02:45:35.431]  We have record sales going on right now.
[02:45:36.403 --> 02:45:42.707]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:45:42.707 --> 02:45:42.907]  It's you!
[02:46:05.620 --> 02:46:07.802]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:46:07.802 --> 02:46:16.551]  It is you, the info warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:46:16.551 --> 02:46:21.116]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:46:21.116 --> 02:46:22.577]  You are the info war.
[02:46:22.577 --> 02:46:26.101]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:46:26.761 --> 02:46:38.145]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:46:38.145 --> 02:46:46.128]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:46:46.128 --> 02:46:53.171]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:53.171 --> 02:46:55.912]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[02:46:59.213 --> 02:47:01.827]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.834 --> 02:47:22.157]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:22.157 --> 02:47:27.020]  Yvette Munoz is our guest.
[02:47:27.020 --> 02:47:29.021]  She goes by your mama's chest hair.
[02:47:29.021 --> 02:47:30.582]  Yo mama's chest hair.
[02:47:30.582 --> 02:47:35.385]  This happened a few months ago, but it's popped back up in the news and I thought, hey, we ought to get her on.
[02:47:35.385 --> 02:47:40.408]  A cost of CNN mocks Hispanic woman for Trump Pepe doll and InfoWars shirt.
[02:47:41.863 --> 02:47:57.889]  That picked up a lot of news then, but I thought, why not get her back on, because it's been recirculated out on the web, and you know, they demonized this Pepe the Frog, the creator of it, told people, use it, I don't care who you are, use it, but now he sues you if you even...
[02:47:59.989 --> 02:48:04.834]  Even basically even talk about it, I guess, or just even hold up a frog, so I guess he might shoo you.
[02:48:04.834 --> 02:48:06.195]  That's how the left operates now.
[02:48:06.195 --> 02:48:08.337]  They just think they own total reality.
[02:48:08.337 --> 02:48:14.403]  But there she is wearing our anti-fascist shirt, because they really are fascists.
[02:48:14.403 --> 02:48:17.326]  And I thought we would get yo mama's chest hair.
[02:48:17.326 --> 02:48:20.009]  Instead of saying mama's got the chest hair, wear them.
[02:48:20.009 --> 02:48:22.091]  And you've got a very interesting background.
[02:48:22.791 --> 02:48:23.532]  For what you're doing.
[02:48:23.532 --> 02:48:28.176]  I want to find out what attracted you to the Infowar and what's happened since this and some of the new breaking news.
[02:48:28.176 --> 02:48:29.897]  But, uh, yo mama's chest hair.
[02:48:29.897 --> 02:48:32.159]  That's what she wants to go by.
[02:48:32.159 --> 02:48:33.460]  Tell us about that nickname first.
[02:48:35.565 --> 02:48:44.510]  Well, it originated from a movie, Mean Girls, when the goth girl, and I keep forgetting her name, but the goth girl, she was wearing a sweater.
[02:48:44.510 --> 02:48:48.452]  This guy asked her, hey, nice sweater, what's it made of?
[02:48:48.452 --> 02:48:55.516]  And her response was, it's made out of your mama's chest hair, and so that's where your mama's chest hair was born.
[02:48:58.609 --> 02:48:59.890]  Well that's amazing.
[02:48:59.890 --> 02:49:13.220]  Tell us about, this is back in the news, because you've been converting some of your friends from being anti-Trump to being pro-Trump, including some folks that I'm told are basically eligible for DACA.
[02:49:13.220 --> 02:49:13.921]  So tell us about that.
[02:49:15.376 --> 02:49:16.737]  Yeah, that's actually my cousin.
[02:49:16.737 --> 02:49:29.706]  Him and I are very close and what happened is once he found out that I voted for Trump, he was very devastated and he just, you know, he kept repeating to me that I betrayed him.
[02:49:29.706 --> 02:49:36.751]  At first he was, like I said, we were all being indoctrinated by Univision and
[02:49:39.606 --> 02:50:04.262]  He thought it was just the end of the world for him so I'm able to debate at the time because I actually got red-pilled after the elections and I found out about InfoWars after the elections as well and once I was able to tell him what was going on I got him to sit with me because he was getting a little bit upset and like I said he was even threatening me at some point and
[02:50:05.407 --> 02:50:14.170]  And I finally got to sit with him and he was willing to listen, unlike some of my other cousins who just cut communication with me.
[02:50:14.170 --> 02:50:18.352]  He sat there and I was debunking every fake news I could.
[02:50:18.352 --> 02:50:20.853]  Everything he was concerned about, I was helping him out.
[02:50:24.006 --> 02:50:35.151]  From there on we were still in a relationship and I even talk about it in the article that I kept going to his soccer games where people will demonize me for being a Trump supporter and a Mexican and
[02:50:40.189 --> 02:50:59.287]  He finally changed 100% his mind because after the State of the Union speech, Trump had mentioned that he was willing to give a path to citizenship to the DACA recipients if we only build the wall first, which is not a bad deal at all.
[02:50:59.707 --> 02:50:59.907]  Wow.
[02:51:22.094 --> 02:51:47.466]  I did have an incident in January when the government shutdown happened and I was a little bit upset because they were doing all this for illegals when we have other issues of our own and I kind of got my... I was very angry at the time and so my anger took over me and I put a horrible post out there where I was saying that I was going to deport
[02:51:48.519 --> 02:51:55.503]  The DACA's parents, if the DACA people wouldn't send an email or something to get the government running again.
[02:51:55.503 --> 02:51:58.725]  And it backfired!
[02:51:58.725 --> 02:52:07.971]  But my cousin, he stood up there and he was trying to defend me because he knows that I can say anything, you know, because I'm all about freedom of speech.
[02:52:07.971 --> 02:52:09.212]  Sure, sure, absolutely.
[02:52:09.212 --> 02:52:12.034]  And people get mad, people say things tongue-in-cheek and, you know, make a point.
[02:52:13.550 --> 02:52:18.233]  On the left does it, it's all cute, and okay when we do it, we're all demonized or stuff taken out of context.
[02:52:18.233 --> 02:52:19.533]  But here's the thing.
[02:52:19.533 --> 02:52:25.917]  The Democrats want a giant, controlled group that they can keep disenfranchised, and so do the Republican establishment.
[02:52:25.917 --> 02:52:26.997]  Trump's changing that.
[02:52:26.997 --> 02:52:40.945]  And like you said, my listeners are like, wait, Trump's going back when he said that we would give a pass to people that aren't criminals who are, you know, in DACA, made by criminal, who've really been here for a while, who are contributing, and who haven't committed serious crimes.
[02:52:40.945 --> 02:52:42.606]  That's what Trump said during the campaign.
[02:52:43.266 --> 02:52:52.593]  He said, listen, the so-called DACA program now just lets everybody in, because if we have a serious one that actually vets people, I'm all about making a path to citizenship or coming here easier.
[02:52:52.593 --> 02:52:53.613]  We need this.
[02:52:53.613 --> 02:52:58.337]  Trump's like, I hire all sorts of people that come here legally from all over the world to work at my hotels and golf courses.
[02:52:58.337 --> 02:53:01.459]  He just said, you just can't have totally open borders.
[02:53:01.459 --> 02:53:03.360]  And then you've got Latin America collapsing.
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:05.461]  Mexico's built a fence and a wall.
[02:53:05.461 --> 02:53:06.882]  And so, yeah, that's the common sense.
[02:53:06.882 --> 02:53:08.183]  And that's why I couldn't believe
[02:53:09.324 --> 02:53:13.969]  He got attacked by conservatives thinking he'd gone back on what he said when he hadn't.
[02:53:13.969 --> 02:53:16.512]  And then a lot of leftists just ignored the fact.
[02:53:16.512 --> 02:53:21.777]  But as soon as he said that, the Democrats said, no, we want no borders at all.
[02:53:21.777 --> 02:53:23.119]  Well, that's just completely insane.
[02:53:25.316 --> 02:53:29.158]  I agree, I agree 100% and that's the funny thing.
[02:53:29.158 --> 02:53:33.380]  See, I used to live in Mexico and I remember the elections.
[02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:43.205]  My very, very first rally was going to Vicente Fox and we actually thought that this guy was going to change the world, but he was just a typical politician like the rest of them.
[02:53:43.205 --> 02:53:49.609]  And the way they do the campaigns in Mexico is they always have to give something to the people so they can vote for them.
[02:53:50.249 --> 02:53:53.772]  So, people are in the middle, and then you got the two politicians, right?
[02:53:53.772 --> 02:53:58.795]  Two different politicians, and then the people are like, which is, what are they giving out there?
[02:53:58.795 --> 02:54:00.537]  Oh, they're giving buttons.
[02:54:00.537 --> 02:54:02.038]  Okay, what are they giving out there?
[02:54:02.038 --> 02:54:03.619]  Uh, they're giving hats.
[02:54:03.619 --> 02:54:06.001]  Okay, let's go with the guy that gives out the hat.
[02:54:06.001 --> 02:54:08.662]  They don't even look at the policies, and same thing here.
[02:54:08.662 --> 02:54:13.246]  The Democrats are giving so many aid to illegals, and I've witnessed this.
[02:54:13.966 --> 02:54:15.248]  Exactly, and then meanwhile, it's like...
[02:54:32.438 --> 02:54:35.581]  Folks say, don't give people fish, teach them how to fish.
[02:54:35.581 --> 02:54:36.302]  It's the same thing.
[02:54:36.302 --> 02:54:38.765]  Trump knows we've been artificially shut down.
[02:54:38.765 --> 02:54:41.968]  We've been artificially managed to make the economy start shutting down.
[02:54:41.968 --> 02:54:43.690]  He just says, I'm going to get out of your way.
[02:54:43.690 --> 02:54:45.432]  I'm not even giving you your freedom.
[02:54:45.432 --> 02:54:49.736]  I'm just going to get out of your way and work to make it more fair for jobs here.
[02:54:49.736 --> 02:54:52.119]  And we see it already in a year and a half turning around.
[02:54:52.119 --> 02:54:53.720]  That's what the Democrats are panicking.
[02:54:54.701 --> 02:54:55.822]  They're going crazy.
[02:54:55.822 --> 02:55:03.386]  And then I'm just really concerned, though, because, like you said, most people know what's going on.
[02:55:03.386 --> 02:55:05.047]  And a lot of Hispanic Americans get it.
[02:55:05.047 --> 02:55:08.350]  A lot of the people that are immigrants here that came here legally, illegally, they get it.
[02:55:08.350 --> 02:55:13.533]  But a certain percentage, mainly it's white liberals that attack me and others, but there's a certain percentage
[02:55:15.035 --> 02:55:21.298]  of Hispanic folks that are buying into this lie that really think Trump and white people are out to get him.
[02:55:21.298 --> 02:55:34.264]  And that's why I appreciate your courage, because I've talked to other Hispanic listeners and Mexican listeners who have had their fathers and mothers ostracize them, have had whole families turn against them because they said, no, Trump didn't say all Mexicans were criminal.
[02:55:34.264 --> 02:55:36.826]  He said a wide open border, the border's got a lot of crime on it.
[02:55:37.446 --> 02:55:38.627]  Criminal Americans go to Mexico.
[02:55:38.627 --> 02:55:39.188]  We know that.
[02:55:39.188 --> 02:55:41.309]  That doesn't mean all Americans are criminals.
[02:55:41.309 --> 02:55:44.852]  And so they'll defend and say, no, Trump didn't say that.
[02:55:44.852 --> 02:55:46.193]  Show me the clip.
[02:55:46.193 --> 02:55:48.755]  And then their own family says, I'll kill you, basically.
[02:55:48.755 --> 02:55:50.137]  And I've had listeners tell me this.
[02:55:50.137 --> 02:55:51.277]  I've gotten letters.
[02:55:51.277 --> 02:55:52.679]  And so it sounds like you've gone through that.
[02:55:52.679 --> 02:55:56.021]  You're saying, do you go to soccer games wearing a Make America Great Again hat?
[02:55:56.021 --> 02:55:58.483]  Because you said you like go to soccer games and they get in your face.
[02:55:58.483 --> 02:55:58.924]  What happens?
[02:56:00.217 --> 02:56:03.738]  No, I did not take any of my MAGA gear.
[02:56:03.738 --> 02:56:06.740]  I just go like a regular civilian.
[02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:10.741]  I go and support my cousin whenever he's playing games.
[02:56:10.741 --> 02:56:17.784]  I try to leave the politics out of everything, but if somebody comes to me and tries to talk to me about politics, then I'll respond to them.
[02:56:17.784 --> 02:56:20.745]  Most of the time they hate it because they hate the truth.
[02:56:20.745 --> 02:56:21.506]  But guess what?
[02:56:21.506 --> 02:56:22.986]  Liars hate the truth.
[02:56:22.986 --> 02:56:23.847]  And that's the reality.
[02:56:23.847 --> 02:56:26.788]  Who's the pretty girl with you there in the American flag outfit?
[02:56:28.177 --> 02:56:30.019]  That's my sister.
[02:56:30.019 --> 02:56:30.800]  We're very close.
[02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:36.766]  She's the one that red-pilled me and thanks to her we found out about you.
[02:56:36.766 --> 02:56:45.396]  She started red-pilling me about the spirit cooking and, you know, with the algorithms it led us to InfoWars because we never knew what InfoWars was.
[02:56:45.396 --> 02:56:49.000]  And then we saw you there just yelling the news and we're like, wow, this guy...
[02:56:50.126 --> 02:56:52.547]  He's a little too passionate.
[02:56:52.547 --> 02:56:56.629]  But then you kept giving out sources, and that's what really matters.
[02:56:56.629 --> 02:57:08.595]  We checked out the sources, all the articles that you were talking about, and that's the funny part is that in the mainstream media on TV, they just give you tiny information where they can still get it out of context.
[02:57:10.109 --> 02:57:19.914]  The only way to get the real news is by reading, and that's why I follow you so much, because I do believe that you have the right sources.
[02:57:19.914 --> 02:57:21.274]  Well, you and your sister are awesome.
[02:57:21.274 --> 02:57:24.636]  Maybe we should get you as auxiliary reporters to go out and do some work with them.
[02:57:24.636 --> 02:57:25.576]  Maybe we should try to hire you.
[02:57:25.576 --> 02:57:26.657]  I need to raise some money to do that.
[02:57:27.037 --> 02:57:31.078]  I didn't plug this hour, InfoWareStore.com, but when we come back, we'll do five more minutes with you.
[02:57:31.078 --> 02:57:39.761]  I want to invite you back for a full hour to take calls soon, and invite your sister on as well, but I want to ask you about Jim Acosta calling you a white supremacist.
[02:57:39.761 --> 02:57:43.122]  I mean, I think it's pretty obvious that you're not even, I mean, you're a very pretty lady.
[02:57:43.122 --> 02:57:45.043]  You're not white, and he's saying calling you a white supremacist.
[02:57:45.143 --> 02:57:49.265]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:57:49.265 --> 02:57:56.329]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[02:57:56.329 --> 02:58:01.131]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.

[02:58:46.460 --> 02:58:52.042]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 Plus products, we have it in 4's life.
[02:58:52.042 --> 02:58:52.903]  It'd take hours.
[02:58:52.903 --> 02:58:55.344]  Michael's DX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:58:55.344 --> 02:58:56.524]  It's stronger.
[02:58:56.524 --> 02:58:58.145]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:58:58.145 --> 02:59:01.366]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:59:01.366 --> 02:59:02.486]  It's back in stock.
[02:59:02.486 --> 02:59:05.648]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:59:05.648 --> 02:59:08.969]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:59:09.429 --> 02:59:09.569]  Yeah.
[02:59:28.226 --> 02:59:30.167]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:05.149 --> 03:00:14.656]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[03:00:14.656 --> 03:00:22.382]  Thomas Jefferson.
[03:00:22.382 --> 03:00:27.306]  Yo mama's chest chair is here with us and I'm gonna get her and her sister down here to be in studio with us the next few weeks.
[03:00:29.583 --> 03:00:31.724]  She's a firecracker.
[03:00:31.724 --> 03:00:37.006]  She didn't want to complain on air, but they got death threats, you name it, being pro-Trump going back over a year ago.
[03:00:37.006 --> 03:00:42.909]  So just recap what that was like, and talk about your sister's husband that was actually first domino in the family.
[03:00:42.909 --> 03:00:49.752]  We're going to get him down here, too, and celebrate people that are trailblazers, that go against the propaganda, and then realize the truth.
[03:00:50.572 --> 03:00:51.754]  Which is a beautiful thing.
[03:00:51.754 --> 03:00:54.477]  It's the leftist brainwashing of people.
[03:00:54.477 --> 03:00:55.378]  It's not skin color.
[03:00:55.378 --> 03:00:57.701]  It's the brainwashing that is the problem.
[03:00:57.701 --> 03:00:59.963]  And that's why they think with the demographics they're going to do that.
[03:00:59.963 --> 03:01:02.186]  But if we actually take action, we can win.
[03:01:02.186 --> 03:01:05.170]  But just get back to Acosta calling you a white supremacist.
[03:01:08.461 --> 03:01:19.468]  Yeah, it was pretty funny because we were coming out of the Trump rally at the time when that picture was taken and we were actually sitting right by Trump.
[03:01:19.468 --> 03:01:28.352]  So we were so excited that we were in this world and we've been watching through the internet and to be part of it was super thrilling.
[03:01:28.352 --> 03:01:32.615]  So when I saw Jim Acosta with the rest of the reporters in the back,
[03:01:33.976 --> 03:01:35.317]  I didn't have any anger.
[03:01:35.317 --> 03:01:36.197]  I didn't hate him.
[03:01:36.197 --> 03:01:38.859]  I was just thinking, oh my god, this guy from TV!
[03:01:38.859 --> 03:01:40.200]  So I was like, Jim!
[03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:42.081]  Hey, Jim!
[03:01:42.081 --> 03:01:43.943]  And he finally said hello.
[03:01:43.943 --> 03:01:50.567]  And so I put out my phone, and I took a picture, and he was even doing the thumb up.
[03:01:50.567 --> 03:01:54.290]  So then he got up, and then he's like, may I take a picture of you?
[03:01:54.290 --> 03:01:58.193]  And then my sister, she had the pepper at the time, and she just threw it at me.
[03:01:58.193 --> 03:02:00.935]  And I'm like, OK, I'll hold it.
[03:02:00.935 --> 03:02:02.056]  And I did my duck lips.
[03:02:04.105 --> 03:02:08.308]  And then I knew he was going to put it up on Twitter right away.
[03:02:08.308 --> 03:02:09.750]  It just gave me that impression.
[03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:17.856]  And at the time, like I told you, because all this went down about the Dreamers and that they were threatening, I had to take down all my social media.
[03:02:17.856 --> 03:02:20.038]  But I went back on Twitter.
[03:02:20.038 --> 03:02:24.801]  I opened my own Twitter account, just like a response to Jim Acosta.
[03:02:24.801 --> 03:02:31.086]  And it kind of backfired because, well, I'm a Mexican descendant.
[03:02:31.086 --> 03:02:32.127]  Oh, look, there's a picture.
[03:02:34.346 --> 03:02:39.995]  Well, you know, the claim that Pepe is white supremacist because a few white supremacists used it, everybody was using it.
[03:02:39.995 --> 03:02:44.582]  It's just, it's like you can take any symbol, put Santa Claus next to a white supremacist, now we gotta ban Santa Claus?
[03:02:46.839 --> 03:03:05.408]  Right, it was just a meme so I mean you just put a little bit of truth in there and it's supposed to be funny but That's how it all started because Hillary was declaring war on this pepe saying that it's some dark Lord and we worship this thing like cultists Yeah, I guess even we worship it, I forgot that
[03:03:07.538 --> 03:03:11.039]  Yeah, yeah, and I'm like, oh God, no way.
[03:03:11.039 --> 03:03:12.440]  Did she really say that?
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:18.681]  So we started, I guess you can say, trolling and we're like, yeah, Pepe, Pepe, we adore this guy.
[03:03:18.681 --> 03:03:21.262]  But now it means a lot more.
[03:03:21.262 --> 03:03:27.424]  To me, Pepe is very similar to the story of Moses.
[03:03:27.424 --> 03:03:36.947]  Remember when Moses was trying to free the people from Egypt and there were the plagues being sent and one of the plagues was the frogs.
[03:03:37.447 --> 03:03:41.009]  So now it feels like this is worldwide.
[03:03:41.009 --> 03:03:47.913]  Everybody is identifying with Keck or Pepe as you want to call it.
[03:03:47.913 --> 03:03:52.256]  And now it feels like we are helping Trump, who's chosen by God.
[03:03:52.256 --> 03:03:54.918]  We're going to help him free the rest of the people.
[03:03:54.918 --> 03:03:56.979]  We are that plague and we're coming hard.
[03:03:56.979 --> 03:04:00.161]  It's like the frogs into Egypt.
[03:04:00.161 --> 03:04:01.261]  Wow.
[03:04:01.261 --> 03:04:02.802]  I've never heard that.
[03:04:02.802 --> 03:04:03.543]  Did you come up with that?
[03:04:05.129 --> 03:04:07.051]  That's how I see it.
[03:04:07.051 --> 03:04:11.594]  I haven't heard it, but that's how I see it because I'm not sure... No, no, that's what I'm saying.
[03:04:11.594 --> 03:04:12.935]  You created that allegory.
[03:04:12.935 --> 03:04:14.236]  That's powerful.
[03:04:14.236 --> 03:04:16.778]  Pepe or the frogs invading Egypt.
[03:04:16.778 --> 03:04:18.379]  I love that!
[03:04:18.379 --> 03:04:22.642]  Yeah, it's super fun.
[03:04:22.642 --> 03:04:24.043]  Alright, well, you're awesome.
[03:04:24.043 --> 03:04:27.285]  I look forward to meeting you and your sister and her husband here in studio.
[03:04:27.285 --> 03:04:28.586]  So as soon as you want to come down here,
[03:04:30.086 --> 03:04:30.606]  I'm ready!
[03:04:30.606 --> 03:04:32.408]  Okay, you're awesome.
[03:04:32.408 --> 03:04:34.489]  Yeah, next Thursday and Friday I'm gonna go to a family event.
[03:04:34.489 --> 03:04:35.710]  I won't be here, but any other time.
[03:04:35.710 --> 03:04:40.994]  You guys flown down here to Texas and we look forward to hanging out with you guys and breaking bread with you.
[03:04:40.994 --> 03:04:41.634]  You're awesome.
[03:04:41.634 --> 03:04:42.115]  We love you.
[03:04:42.115 --> 03:04:42.835]  We appreciate you.
[03:04:42.835 --> 03:04:43.456]  Thanks for standing up.
[03:04:43.456 --> 03:04:44.276]  You said it all fair.
[03:04:44.276 --> 03:04:46.398]  You told me death threats, everything, but you're still here.
[03:04:47.759 --> 03:04:48.520]  Who cares, man?
[03:04:48.520 --> 03:04:51.662]  I'm here to die for this country and for the truth, mainly.
[03:04:51.662 --> 03:04:53.043]  And I know that God is on my side.

[03:06:04.597 --> 03:06:09.555]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:48.445 --> 03:06:51.047]  The article is up on InfoWars.com
[03:06:58.911 --> 03:07:05.195]  Here's why Hillary Clinton is running in 2020.
[03:07:05.195 --> 03:07:15.663]  That's the article, but buried in it, I'm gonna put our own article out, buried in the article, is the poll!
[03:07:15.663 --> 03:07:20.286]  Will Hillary Clinton run for president in 2020?
[03:07:20.286 --> 03:07:22.868]  Yes, she'll run.
[03:07:22.868 --> 03:07:24.609]  No, she won't run.
[03:07:24.609 --> 03:07:26.631]  She'll be dead by then.
[03:07:26.631 --> 03:07:28.112]  So Drudge has his poll up there.
[03:07:29.076 --> 03:07:31.459]  And I'm going to stay on air now until we have our own article out.
[03:07:31.459 --> 03:07:32.200]  No big deal.
[03:07:32.200 --> 03:07:37.346]  Just our own article with the polls so I can tell listeners to go to InfoWars.com.
[03:07:39.992 --> 03:07:41.534]  And take the poll.
[03:07:41.534 --> 03:07:44.516]  And I'm going to get Paul to retweet it as well.
[03:07:44.516 --> 03:07:50.482]  But I have an intention to get that poll big and actually reach our audience at Infowars.com.
[03:07:50.482 --> 03:07:56.748]  It's in an article by Joel Gilbert when he first Friday predicted that Hillary will be running for president in 2020.
[03:07:56.748 --> 03:08:00.572]  And the evidence of it, we've talked to insiders, they say she is intending to do it.
[03:08:00.572 --> 03:08:02.193]  But I also want to create our own article.
[03:08:06.084 --> 03:08:08.766]  Where it's there, then we put the Joel Gilbert story under it.
[03:08:08.766 --> 03:08:11.348]  So that's all coming up.
[03:08:11.348 --> 03:08:14.911]  Yo mama's chest hair is her handle.
[03:08:14.911 --> 03:08:18.994]  She lives up in Chicago and she's a Hispanic Trump supporter.
[03:08:18.994 --> 03:08:22.017]  And so you were telling me off air as I asked about all the harassment you got.
[03:08:22.017 --> 03:08:26.380]  People can follow you on Twitter at yo underscore mamas underscore chest underscore hair.
[03:08:26.380 --> 03:08:28.022]  People should follow you there.
[03:08:28.022 --> 03:08:30.484]  And you got your sister and her husband that got you involved in all this.
[03:08:30.484 --> 03:08:31.605]  Just recap for people.
[03:08:32.445 --> 03:08:38.149]  When you woke up, the saga, what it's been like, you said your dad is asleep with a gun because of all the death threats.
[03:08:38.149 --> 03:08:49.397]  I mean, lay out what it's like for a Hispanic person in America who tries to support America First, prosperity, having basic immigration rules like any other country has.
[03:08:49.397 --> 03:08:54.361]  What you have to go through, because we think as basic Trump supporters we get harassed, but from what I've read and seen,
[03:08:55.441 --> 03:09:04.725]  Black Trump supporters, Hispanic Trump supporters, I mean, they get attacked, they get called white supremacists, they get fired from their jobs, they get thrown out of stores.
[03:09:04.725 --> 03:09:09.166]  So lay it all out for us.
[03:09:09.166 --> 03:09:11.367]  Yeah, it's very scary at first.
[03:09:13.815 --> 03:09:25.885]  I mean I know that they're all talk and they're just angry and that's one thing about the Mexicans is that they're mainly a little bit too selfish because all they care about is immigration.
[03:09:25.885 --> 03:09:34.252]  They don't care about this other bigger problems that are going on in the country that if we succeed in those problems then we can help the whole world.
[03:09:34.252 --> 03:09:38.036]  But no, they just want to focus on themselves and they don't even know exactly what they want.
[03:09:38.036 --> 03:09:39.257]  They just know that they're angry.
[03:09:39.257 --> 03:09:40.718]  So that's why
[03:09:43.057 --> 03:09:43.978]  It was pretty scary.
[03:09:43.978 --> 03:09:49.523]  I had to take down all my social media because you cannot say anything about Trump.
[03:09:49.523 --> 03:09:53.927]  And that's so funny to me because, I mean, he is a president.
[03:09:53.927 --> 03:09:57.050]  Since when can we not support the president?
[03:09:57.050 --> 03:09:59.793]  And like I said, I was born here.
[03:09:59.793 --> 03:10:02.616]  My duty is to protect this country first.
[03:10:02.616 --> 03:10:04.717]  My people are the American people.
[03:10:04.717 --> 03:10:06.519]  I don't care what color you are.
[03:10:06.519 --> 03:10:08.221]  It's the idea that
[03:10:09.185 --> 03:10:14.649]  This beautiful country, the culture in this country is that it allows you to have your own culture.
[03:10:14.649 --> 03:10:17.590]  So why are we trying to switch and change all of this?
[03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:23.314]  We're running away from Mexico because of all the crime and all the corruption, and we want to bring this here?
[03:10:23.314 --> 03:10:24.735]  I just don't get it.
[03:10:24.735 --> 03:10:32.820]  This is the greatest nation in the world, and that's one thing that Mexicans should understand, but they've been brainwashed since Mexico.
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:40.321]  Their politicians brainwashed them and now they're brainwashed here by pretty words that come from the Democrats.
[03:10:40.321 --> 03:10:40.781]  And you know what?
[03:10:40.781 --> 03:10:43.302]  And some RINO Republicans as well.
[03:10:43.302 --> 03:10:59.225]  So I hope one day they can realize that this fight, and it's also including them, but they need to wait a little bit before we can fix the whole nation and then we can see the immigration process.
[03:11:00.714 --> 03:11:01.575]  Well, you're amazing.
[03:11:01.575 --> 03:11:03.456]  We really appreciate you and your courage.
[03:11:03.456 --> 03:11:11.442]  And it'd be one thing if Trump got in and the economy didn't turn around and optimism didn't turn around and all these corrupt globalists weren't getting in trouble.
[03:11:11.442 --> 03:11:22.730]  But when we know how the globalists have been working to hurt the country and working around the clock to do all this, it just really makes me upset with people that buy into the hype.
[03:11:22.730 --> 03:11:25.331]  But trailblazers like yourself are the real leaders of the future.
[03:11:25.331 --> 03:11:26.332]  And you know what Mark Twain said?
[03:11:26.332 --> 03:11:29.975]  He said, a patriot is a scarce man or woman in the beginning.
[03:11:30.635 --> 03:11:31.995]  Hated, scorned, and feared.
[03:11:31.995 --> 03:11:37.977]  But in time when the Patriot succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a Patriot.
[03:11:37.977 --> 03:11:39.517]  So we really appreciate you.
[03:11:39.517 --> 03:11:42.018]  Yo underscore mamas underscore chest hair.
[03:11:42.018 --> 03:11:42.678]  Thank you so much.
[03:11:42.678 --> 03:11:44.578]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:11:44.578 --> 03:11:45.699]  All right, take care.
[03:11:45.699 --> 03:11:47.959]  Oh my gosh, there's Pepe.
[03:11:47.959 --> 03:11:48.719]  Whoa!
[03:11:48.719 --> 03:11:54.621]  The creator of Pepe says it doesn't matter if fair use, doesn't matter he said trademark free, doesn't matter he just tried to get his trademark.
[03:11:54.621 --> 03:11:57.582]  He says you're not allowed to show that frog.
[03:11:57.582 --> 03:11:59.162]  So do you want to bow down to Ferry right now?
[03:12:00.336 --> 03:12:03.538]  Well, this is Keck, and he's been altered.
[03:12:03.538 --> 03:12:05.080]  He doesn't look like Pepe.
[03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:10.464]  It is a frog, but I mean... But I mean, obviously, he can't claim he owns Kermit the Frog, either.
[03:12:10.464 --> 03:12:13.146]  Hell, next he'll say these are lily pads, Bob.
[03:12:13.146 --> 03:12:14.147]  Bang, bang, bang.
[03:12:14.147 --> 03:12:17.089]  Hey, hey, is Pepe gay?
[03:12:17.089 --> 03:12:18.670]  Yeah, no, he's not gay.
[03:12:18.670 --> 03:12:20.011]  He's atomically correct.
[03:12:20.011 --> 03:12:23.074]  I'm not gonna show his private parts, unless you want to.
[03:12:23.074 --> 03:12:26.416]  So, Keck's packing?
[03:12:26.416 --> 03:12:27.737]  I'm still... Right.
[03:12:27.737 --> 03:12:29.939]  I'm still protecting him from those evil chemicals.
[03:12:32.805 --> 03:12:33.786]  You're a real sweetheart.
[03:12:33.786 --> 03:12:34.586]  Very charming.
[03:12:34.586 --> 03:12:36.447]  Alright, you're awesome.
[03:12:36.447 --> 03:12:38.127]  That's a family show.
[03:12:38.127 --> 03:12:39.768]  I'm not going to make a really bad joke right now.
[03:12:39.768 --> 03:12:40.628]  But hey, you're awesome.
[03:12:40.628 --> 03:12:42.549]  Thank you so much.
[03:12:42.549 --> 03:12:44.110]  Alright, you too.
[03:12:44.110 --> 03:12:44.830]  Take care, Alex.
[03:12:44.830 --> 03:12:46.111]  Thank you so much for having me.
[03:12:46.111 --> 03:12:47.431]  I enjoyed every second of it.
[03:12:47.431 --> 03:12:48.052]  I enjoyed having you.
[03:12:48.052 --> 03:12:51.093]  Like I said, I'm one of your biggest fans.
[03:12:51.093 --> 03:12:52.153]  It's going to be awesome.
[03:12:52.153 --> 03:12:53.514]  I can't wait to meet you and your family.
[03:12:53.514 --> 03:12:54.594]  Alright, folks.

[03:13:41.614 --> 03:13:42.315]  Lionel, my friend!
[03:13:46.636 --> 03:13:51.599]  Tell us what you've got lined up in your raft of repertoire today.
[03:13:51.599 --> 03:13:54.822]  Yes, in my quiver, as it were.
[03:13:54.822 --> 03:14:06.169]  First, we're going to be talking about some rudiments involving the Supreme Court, what you need to know, and about this crazy idea that somehow Roe against Wade is going to be overturned, that will never happen.
[03:14:06.169 --> 03:14:13.034]  Also, picking up where you brought up about Hillary Clinton and why the ostensible flying coach
[03:14:13.494 --> 03:14:14.975]  What is that all about?
[03:14:14.975 --> 03:14:16.676]  How is that even happening?
[03:14:16.676 --> 03:14:20.399]  It's a super cheap trick, super ridiculous.
[03:14:20.399 --> 03:14:25.042]  Oh, we're billionaires that use taxpayer money to fly around on private jets and our foundation.
[03:14:25.042 --> 03:14:27.643]  Oh, but now we fly around with all the proles.
[03:14:29.008 --> 03:14:30.308]  I want to ask you this question, Alex.
[03:14:30.308 --> 03:14:47.035]  Remember sometime in December there was a talk about the President issuing an executive order which basically froze a series of assets of individuals, corporations and the like that were supposedly or alleged to be involved in various trafficking activities and the like.
[03:14:47.035 --> 03:14:47.795]  Could it be?
[03:14:48.726 --> 03:15:02.550]  Could it be under the wildest of imaginations that somehow the Clintons are having to cut corners because for Hillary to appear in public, when she's not at all public, Bill loves it, he thrives on that, it's his oxygen.
[03:15:02.550 --> 03:15:05.790]  But she is, she's averse.
[03:15:05.790 --> 03:15:08.051]  She's a reclusive demonic control freak.
[03:15:09.130 --> 03:15:11.471]  Now don't hold back, don't sugarcoat it, please.
[03:15:11.471 --> 03:15:12.411]  What do you think?
[03:15:12.411 --> 03:15:14.892]  Don't, don't, don't, don't ride the fence, Alex.
[03:15:14.892 --> 03:15:15.993]  Just let me know what you think.
[03:15:15.993 --> 03:15:20.234]  And by the way, she never even told us what was she wearing with that backpack.
[03:15:20.234 --> 03:15:22.415]  I think it was reptilian exoskeleton.
[03:15:22.415 --> 03:15:23.535]  We never found out about that.
[03:15:23.535 --> 03:15:33.099]  So anyway, coming up, I want to talk about, to make you smarter about the Supreme Court, so you'll be able to talk to and wow your friends, also about Hillary, and another thing too is,
[03:15:33.659 --> 03:15:38.481]  Did you hear that Twitter is basically killing 70 million accounts?
[03:15:38.481 --> 03:15:42.162]  Do you have a First Amendment right?
[03:15:42.162 --> 03:15:46.684]  A freedom of the press right to social media that basically excludes you?
[03:15:46.684 --> 03:15:51.746]  We'll talk about it all straight ahead, but as you know, they've argued that, so that should be the case.
[03:15:51.746 --> 03:15:52.206]  Stay with us.
[03:15:53.393 --> 03:15:55.274]  Healthcare reform is confusing.

[03:19:57.305 --> 03:19:59.916]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:27.541 --> 03:20:29.445]  And now Lionel takes over.
[03:20:29.445 --> 03:20:31.950]  I'll be back with a special poll at the start of the next segment though.
[03:20:31.950 --> 03:20:35.057]  This is the InfoWar Lionel of LionelMedia.com.
[03:20:35.057 --> 03:20:37.341]  We've got him lined up tonight during our extended coverage.
[03:20:38.254 --> 03:20:42.918]  Roger Stone's getting lined up, as well as more of the SCOTUS pick.
[03:20:42.918 --> 03:20:45.941]  And I've got to hand it to Lionel.
[03:20:45.941 --> 03:20:49.144]  Lionel's absolutely right whenever he said, look, it's not going to be Napolitano.
[03:20:49.144 --> 03:20:50.665]  I don't care what Trump told him.
[03:20:50.665 --> 03:20:51.886]  He's too old.
[03:20:51.886 --> 03:20:54.528]  And he certainly turned out to be, and he also said other things.
[03:20:54.528 --> 03:20:57.471]  But we're going to be talking about all that coming up.
[03:20:57.471 --> 03:20:58.872]  Go ahead, my friend.
[03:20:58.872 --> 03:21:00.173]  No, and it's not because he's too old.
[03:21:00.173 --> 03:21:01.494]  It's the same thing with Jeanine Pirro.
[03:21:01.494 --> 03:21:04.197]  He's a state guy who doesn't know the federal weirdnesses.
[03:21:06.511 --> 03:21:08.712]  I could not have said it better myself.
[03:21:08.712 --> 03:21:09.953]  Here's a couple of things here.
[03:21:09.953 --> 03:21:20.117]  First and foremost, I fancy, well, I get a kick out of folks who all of a sudden suggest that, well, I could just talk about the Supreme Court.
[03:21:20.117 --> 03:21:27.961]  I mean, it's about abortion and the justices get together and they say, let's see, do we like Roe against Wade?
[03:21:27.961 --> 03:21:29.622]  Do we think it's a good idea?
[03:21:29.622 --> 03:21:30.502]  Let's vote.
[03:21:30.502 --> 03:21:31.723]  It doesn't work that way.
[03:21:32.711 --> 03:21:39.576]  Let me give you an idea of something that drives constitutional scholars, some of them, nuts.
[03:21:39.576 --> 03:21:42.038]  And this may seem a bit dry, but it's not.
[03:21:42.038 --> 03:21:42.859]  I want to do two things.
[03:21:42.859 --> 03:21:54.308]  I want to show you an actual theory and how it is considered anathema to these particular folks, but also explain why it's so critical.
[03:21:54.308 --> 03:21:56.530]  One of the worst cases ever, ever,
[03:21:59.858 --> 03:22:01.840]  Held, if you will, is Roe against Wade.
[03:22:01.840 --> 03:22:07.445]  Now, just personally speaking, so that you know this, I believe, absolutely believe,
[03:22:08.365 --> 03:22:13.626]  That a woman's right to have an abortion should be held, should be had.
[03:22:13.626 --> 03:22:17.747]  That the government should not be able to throw a woman in prison or jail or prohibit it.
[03:22:17.747 --> 03:22:21.388]  Now, by the same token, I personally am against abortion.
[03:22:21.388 --> 03:22:28.810]  I would want to throw everything of my power at other services to encourage adoption.
[03:22:28.810 --> 03:22:29.570]  I'm not
[03:22:30.130 --> 03:22:39.657]  For abortion, but I am equally not for a woman being hauled into, let's say, a police station and being told you're under arrest because you had an abortion.
[03:22:39.657 --> 03:22:41.158]  It's that simple.
[03:22:41.158 --> 03:22:43.840]  I also believe in 100%, 100% abolition of all drug laws.
[03:22:43.840 --> 03:22:47.762]  I mean everything involving the mere possession of a substance.
[03:22:55.137 --> 03:23:10.566]  Meaning, in my perfect world, if you were holding crack cocaine or heroin or whatever it is, you would not be able to be thrown into prison just because of that.
[03:23:10.566 --> 03:23:14.708]  Now, that doesn't mean I advocate drug use or the like.
[03:23:14.708 --> 03:23:19.911]  As a judge, let me go one step further, you're going to love this one, I'm against the death penalty.
[03:23:19.911 --> 03:23:22.333]  100% against the death penalty.
[03:23:22.333 --> 03:23:24.134]  But as a judge,
[03:23:24.870 --> 03:23:49.535]  If I were a judge, federal, supreme court, whatever, and you brought to me the case involving a death penalty case from a state where it was held to be legal, and the court has held death penalty to be legal, if due process considerations are met, I would have absolutely no problem in saying, yep, this was a good case.
[03:23:50.353 --> 03:23:52.574]  The defendant's rights were upheld?
[03:23:52.574 --> 03:23:54.215]  Due process was maintained?
[03:23:54.215 --> 03:23:54.995]  Fine.
[03:23:54.995 --> 03:23:57.036]  Go ahead and execute him.
[03:23:57.036 --> 03:23:58.977]  Even though I'm against it!
[03:23:58.977 --> 03:24:05.080]  I don't get the chance to say, well, I don't think the Texas legislature was on the money.
[03:24:05.080 --> 03:24:09.142]  I don't think the state of Florida was right when they imposed this.
[03:24:09.142 --> 03:24:17.186]  So I'm going to just overrule this and rule it unconstitutional because I don't like it.
[03:24:17.186 --> 03:24:18.347]  That doesn't happen.
[03:24:19.349 --> 03:24:26.335]  I'm against drug laws, but I could uphold a conviction of a trafficker, somebody charged with trafficking.
[03:24:26.335 --> 03:24:39.566]  I could upheld the propriety of a search warrant for something that I think is stupid because the issue I'm being presented is not whether I like it, not whether I think morally it's okay.
[03:24:39.566 --> 03:24:40.207]  It doesn't matter.
[03:24:40.207 --> 03:24:42.769]  I'm given a very limited frame of reference.
[03:24:42.769 --> 03:24:45.552]  Now here's what people hated about Roe against Wade.
[03:24:45.552 --> 03:24:47.013]  This is what drove them crazy.
[03:24:47.634 --> 03:24:50.275]  This thing called substantive due process.
[03:24:50.275 --> 03:24:53.476]  Now bear with me, but I want you to hear the argument.
[03:24:53.476 --> 03:24:55.757]  Because this is what's argued.
[03:24:55.757 --> 03:24:57.118]  This is the argument.
[03:24:57.118 --> 03:25:04.240]  Not what you hear on TV, not what you hear on Fox News, to an extent, or MSDNC, or any of the others.
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:12.863]  Due process provides that you cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.
[03:25:12.863 --> 03:25:16.965]  Life, liberty, property, you can be deprived of that.
[03:25:17.845 --> 03:25:29.829]  So long as the deprivation is done with due process, meaning notice the opportunity to be heard, a trial, a hearing.
[03:25:29.829 --> 03:25:33.351]  You got to be told what it is exactly that they're taking.
[03:25:33.351 --> 03:25:38.953]  So the government can take away your property, can take away your life, can take away your liberty.
[03:25:38.953 --> 03:25:40.894]  It's in the Constitution.
[03:25:40.894 --> 03:25:44.555]  The only thing it talks about is the procedure.
[03:25:45.490 --> 03:25:48.893]  Also called, in some circles, procedural due process.
[03:25:48.893 --> 03:25:50.394]  So let me repeat.
[03:25:50.394 --> 03:25:55.398]  The Constitution says, I can take your life, I can take your liberty, I can take your property.
[03:25:55.398 --> 03:25:56.839]  Ever hear of eminent domain?
[03:25:56.839 --> 03:25:58.861]  Ever hear of capital punishment?
[03:25:58.861 --> 03:26:00.122]  Of course you have.
[03:26:00.122 --> 03:26:02.824]  Ever hear of somebody seizing your property?
[03:26:02.824 --> 03:26:03.785]  Yes.
[03:26:03.785 --> 03:26:08.989]  So long as due process, the procedure is met.
[03:26:08.989 --> 03:26:10.591]  What other people have said was, you know,
[03:26:12.313 --> 03:26:23.181]  We think there should be other laws that just should be maintained, some other rights that should be maintained because of just what they are.
[03:26:23.181 --> 03:26:26.263]  And one of them is this idea of privacy.
[03:26:26.263 --> 03:26:28.965]  They just created this thing.
[03:26:28.965 --> 03:26:32.768]  So the government says, the Constitution says, wait a minute, what are you talking about?
[03:26:32.768 --> 03:26:34.769]  You can't just make something up.
[03:26:36.129 --> 03:26:48.655]  The government says, the Constitution I should say, says that the only thing we're interested in is how you address, how you handle the fact that life, liberty and property have been deprived from you.
[03:26:48.655 --> 03:26:57.359]  We're not talking about whether life or liberty or property is even in and of itself that special.
[03:26:57.359 --> 03:26:59.479]  We're talking about how it's removed from you.
[03:26:59.479 --> 03:27:00.480]  That's what Roe did.
[03:27:01.483 --> 03:27:03.064]  Roe created this.
[03:27:03.064 --> 03:27:04.365]  Do this crazy whatever it is.
[03:27:04.365 --> 03:27:07.867]  Now, that being said, let's cut to the chase.
[03:27:07.867 --> 03:27:13.069]  What I just told you right now has been law review article after law review article.
[03:27:13.069 --> 03:27:17.732]  The Federalist Society have been talking about substantive due process forever and it will bore
[03:27:18.726 --> 03:27:20.388]  You to tears.
[03:27:20.388 --> 03:27:23.290]  That's the kind of stuff these folks talk about.
[03:27:23.290 --> 03:27:24.692]  Administrative law.
[03:27:24.692 --> 03:27:25.813]  Oh, my God.
[03:27:25.813 --> 03:27:26.994]  You want to start with this?
[03:27:26.994 --> 03:27:29.576]  I said, rest, rest, Judicata versus such and such.
[03:27:29.576 --> 03:27:34.541]  It's not about this popular stuff that we talk about.
[03:27:34.541 --> 03:27:36.422]  But listen to me.
[03:27:36.422 --> 03:27:40.346]  Roe is never going to be reversed.
[03:27:41.204 --> 03:27:44.826]  Is never not going to be the law of the land for two reasons.
[03:27:44.826 --> 03:27:52.309]  Number one, Justice Roberts said it, that there have been people, there are people, who grew up knowing nothing but it.
[03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:54.430]  It is so much a part of our civilization.
[03:27:54.430 --> 03:27:58.893]  So what's going to happen is it's going to get curtailed back to almost nothing by the states.
[03:27:58.893 --> 03:28:00.473]  Well, we'll see about that.
[03:28:00.473 --> 03:28:01.194]  We'll see about that.
[03:28:01.194 --> 03:28:04.455]  But more importantly, by the way, I just heard a voice from the heavens.
[03:28:04.455 --> 03:28:05.796]  It sounds exactly like Alex.
[03:28:05.796 --> 03:28:09.678]  But the thing that's the most important is that if you think for any, if you think
[03:28:10.362 --> 03:28:16.190]  That they're going to remove this particular aspect, this particular vehicle of eugenics?
[03:28:16.190 --> 03:28:20.455]  Of 50, 60, whatever million babies removed?
[03:28:20.455 --> 03:28:22.998]  Well, I was about to say, it's the real racists that want this.
[03:28:22.998 --> 03:28:25.602]  I just want anybody to have a shot and a chance.
[03:28:25.602 --> 03:28:26.923]  And expanding on that...
[03:28:28.909 --> 03:28:40.533]  All I know is, is that I agree with you, they're not getting rid of it, and it's a total political football to say it, but these people need to stop using it as a form of birth control.
[03:28:40.533 --> 03:28:44.134]  I mean, if a woman... Absolutely!
[03:28:44.134 --> 03:28:46.835]  The Supreme Court, unfortunately, does not get to answer that.
[03:28:46.835 --> 03:28:51.056]  I think we should just agree to stop partial birth right now.

[03:31:54.127 --> 03:31:58.092]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:31:58.092 --> 03:32:01.376]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:01.376 --> 03:32:07.665]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:07.665 --> 03:32:10.428]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:11.149 --> 03:32:14.973]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:14.973 --> 03:32:21.460]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:21.460 --> 03:32:26.426]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:27.150 --> 03:32:31.072]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:31.072 --> 03:32:38.276]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.276 --> 03:32:43.499]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:43.499 --> 03:32:49.202]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.202 --> 03:32:53.164]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:32:56.693 --> 03:32:59.323]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.126 --> 03:33:30.070]  From the front lines of the Information War, breaking victory against the globalists, we take you live to New York City in Austin, Texas.
[03:33:30.070 --> 03:33:36.813]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:36.813 --> 03:33:44.617]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do not do this as I co-host with the great Lionel, former prosecutor, political expert, syndicated talk show host, bestselling author.
[03:33:46.892 --> 03:33:49.473]  I do not say this tongue-in-cheek just to garner headlines.
[03:33:49.473 --> 03:33:50.914]  That's very easy to do.
[03:33:50.914 --> 03:33:57.758]  It was Matt Drudge first started saying in like 2013 when she'd been missing for a year, is Hillary's brain in a jar?
[03:33:57.758 --> 03:34:01.259]  And they said, oh, Matt Drudge, conspiracy theorist, blah, blah.
[03:34:01.259 --> 03:34:02.820]  And then we started paying attention.
[03:34:02.820 --> 03:34:07.963]  Because I got saddled with the thing that she was sick and saddled with the truth.
[03:34:07.963 --> 03:34:09.243]  I mean, I got the credit.
[03:34:09.243 --> 03:34:10.084]  Drudge didn't get it.
[03:34:11.397 --> 03:34:13.098]  I became the guy that said she was sick.
[03:34:13.098 --> 03:34:14.880]  No, the Secret Service told us.
[03:34:14.880 --> 03:34:20.644]  They said there's a black emergency vehicle, ambulance, she's falling down.
[03:34:20.644 --> 03:34:23.386]  A week after we got told, Millie Weaver started following her around.
[03:34:23.386 --> 03:34:24.567]  They had an emergency tent.
[03:34:24.567 --> 03:34:26.608]  She was in there an hour, stretchers running in.
[03:34:26.608 --> 03:34:38.577]  And then a week and a half later on 9-11, she falls like a ton of bricks, which is apropos because she was involved protecting Al Qaeda and those networks right through into George W. They were both equally guilty, any way you slice it.
[03:34:40.831 --> 03:34:51.674]  And so when I asked this question, I saw the Drudge Report poll, and it was, is she running 2020, or should she run for 2020, or should she just retire?
[03:34:51.674 --> 03:34:54.515]  I thought, well ask the question, do you think she's gonna run?
[03:34:54.515 --> 03:34:57.276]  Not should she run, do you think she's gonna run?
[03:34:57.276 --> 03:35:04.659]  And then I thought, wait a minute, because I was really thinking, yeah, she's gonna run if she still isn't, you know, dead from the brain tumors she had cut out in 2013.
[03:35:07.278 --> 03:35:10.241]  There's no doubt, because I was phrasing the questions at the start of the show.
[03:35:10.241 --> 03:35:12.823]  I said on air, I said, I said, will she?
[03:35:12.823 --> 03:35:13.484]  Will she run?
[03:35:13.484 --> 03:35:16.987]  Well, that's guaranteed if she's able, because she wants to control the party.
[03:35:16.987 --> 03:35:17.868]  The party's bankrupt.
[03:35:17.868 --> 03:35:18.529]  It's like last time.
[03:35:18.529 --> 03:35:22.993]  She's got billions in her war chest, over a billion at least.
[03:35:22.993 --> 03:35:24.454]  She wants all the new contributions.
[03:35:24.454 --> 03:35:25.535]  She stole it from Bernie Sanders.
[03:35:25.535 --> 03:35:26.696]  Of course she will.
[03:35:26.696 --> 03:35:29.639]  So then I thought, it's not a question of will she run or won't she?
[03:35:29.639 --> 03:35:30.320]  She's running.
[03:35:31.479 --> 03:35:33.460]  And our own Joel Gilbert broke that last Friday.
[03:35:33.460 --> 03:35:35.141]  I talked to sources, it's true.
[03:35:35.141 --> 03:35:44.226]  But then the big question is, is it will she won't only if she's dead or completely incapacitated from illness, which I'm obviously not hoping for that.
[03:35:44.226 --> 03:35:47.408]  I want her to get better so we can put her in prison.
[03:35:47.408 --> 03:35:47.608]  Show!
[03:35:48.735 --> 03:35:52.699]  The media is so controlled, though, they would show from the time she stumbled, but not when she fell down.
[03:35:52.699 --> 03:36:01.287]  Let's go ahead and show it, and say Alex Jones is lying, she only stumbled on the curb, but actually, like a side of beef, the Secret Service said, fell on her face.
[03:36:03.302 --> 03:36:05.084]  It's like Weekend at Bernie's here.
[03:36:05.084 --> 03:36:06.465]  Weekend at Hillary's.
[03:36:06.465 --> 03:36:07.245]  So, boom!
[03:36:07.245 --> 03:36:10.568]  Completely down in the vehicle, clearly having a seizure.
[03:36:10.568 --> 03:36:12.230]  Julius Caesar had those, we understand.
[03:36:12.230 --> 03:36:16.033]  The fact is, though, she is an evil person, that's why we don't like her.
[03:36:16.033 --> 03:36:18.935]  So, the poll is up on Infowars.com.
[03:36:18.935 --> 03:36:21.217]  It's not a troll.
[03:36:21.217 --> 03:36:22.458]  It's an honest headline.
[03:36:22.458 --> 03:36:24.220]  Will Hillary Clinton be dead by 2020?
[03:36:24.220 --> 03:36:29.945]  InfoPoll asks, is Hillary running in 2020 or will she be dead by then?
[03:36:31.650 --> 03:36:34.491]  Hell, will the planet be here by then with all the craziness going on?
[03:36:34.491 --> 03:36:37.713]  And so, we don't wish her any harm.
[03:36:37.713 --> 03:36:39.233]  Clearly, she's got medical issues.
[03:36:39.233 --> 03:36:41.134]  So, we just put this poll up.
[03:36:41.134 --> 03:36:41.895]  Can retweet it.
[03:36:41.895 --> 03:36:43.075]  Will Hillary Clinton run 2020?
[03:36:43.075 --> 03:36:44.576]  It's on Real Alex Jones.
[03:36:44.576 --> 03:36:45.296]  Will she run?
[03:36:45.296 --> 03:36:45.996]  Will she retire?
[03:36:45.996 --> 03:36:47.157]  Or will she be dead by then?
[03:36:47.157 --> 03:36:48.597]  I'm gonna cast my vote.
[03:36:48.597 --> 03:36:54.500]  I believe... I believe she's tough and evil.
[03:36:54.500 --> 03:36:56.101]  I believe she will run.
[03:36:56.101 --> 03:36:57.061]  I believe she'll make it.
[03:36:57.061 --> 03:36:58.762]  I think she's got another 4 or 5 years in her.
[03:36:58.762 --> 03:36:59.702]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[03:36:59.702 --> 03:37:00.703]  But I believe she's gonna run.
[03:37:01.923 --> 03:37:04.087]  And I believe that she's going to make it.
[03:37:04.087 --> 03:37:06.511]  I was about to vote for her dying, but I just, I don't know.
[03:37:06.511 --> 03:37:07.733]  I believe Hillary's going to live.
[03:37:07.733 --> 03:37:08.515]  So click on it.
[03:37:08.515 --> 03:37:11.420]  Let's Alex Jones's vote live on air, please.
[03:37:11.420 --> 03:37:11.881]  There you go.
[03:37:11.881 --> 03:37:12.121]  Boom.
[03:37:12.121 --> 03:37:12.522]  Let's vote.
[03:37:14.327 --> 03:37:17.129]  It doesn't have millions of votes like Drudge.
[03:37:17.129 --> 03:37:18.109]  Nothing's as big as Drudge.
[03:37:18.109 --> 03:37:21.752]  But I want everybody to go to Infowars.com with the 6,000 votes that are there.
[03:37:21.752 --> 03:37:23.933]  We get 100,000 votes, 200,000 all the time.
[03:37:23.933 --> 03:37:27.875]  I want to get, and we do polls, we do them every day, I want to get your take on this.
[03:37:27.875 --> 03:37:30.397]  But let's vote for Lionel right now.
[03:37:30.397 --> 03:37:34.199]  Lionel.com, who will be hosting with us tonight during live coverage.
[03:37:34.199 --> 03:37:38.502]  It goes 3 o'clock right through past 9 o'clock tonight with a Supreme Court announcement.
[03:37:39.382 --> 03:37:42.224]  Follow him on Twitter, obviously, there, right there on screen.
[03:37:42.224 --> 03:37:43.565]  He's really popular on YouTube.
[03:37:43.565 --> 03:37:46.167]  His average video has 100,000 views, despite censorship.
[03:37:46.167 --> 03:37:47.468]  That's really phenomenal.
[03:37:47.468 --> 03:37:48.388]  Hundreds of millions of views.
[03:37:48.388 --> 03:37:52.991]  Lionel, didn't mean to hijack the hour, but you invited me to, so it's all your fault now.
[03:37:52.991 --> 03:37:55.093]  You let me in.
[03:37:55.093 --> 03:37:58.755]  Wading into this swamp, what is your vote?
[03:37:58.755 --> 03:38:00.997]  Going to run, going to retire, or going to be dead?
[03:38:01.874 --> 03:38:02.555]  Gonna run.
[03:38:02.555 --> 03:38:03.295]  Gonna run.
[03:38:03.295 --> 03:38:05.056]  Absolutely going to run.
[03:38:05.056 --> 03:38:11.041]  And it goes to show you the complete, absolute meltdown of the Democratic Party.
[03:38:11.041 --> 03:38:13.923]  I mean, I cannot believe this, how they would even do this.
[03:38:13.923 --> 03:38:23.430]  You know, Alex, here in New York, we have this Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, this young lady who is a kind of a latter-day version of Bernie Sanders.
[03:38:23.430 --> 03:38:25.471]  She is a Democratic Socialist.
[03:38:25.471 --> 03:38:28.613]  She, again, invigorated the youth vote.
[03:38:28.613 --> 03:38:30.875]  Bernie Sanders, just better looking.
[03:38:31.897 --> 03:38:44.040]  Well, she also, Bernie Sanders, she's Bernie Sanders, I hope, with a pear, who wasn't made a gelding, and didn't receive an inadvertent orchiectomy, because this man let all these people down.
[03:38:44.040 --> 03:38:45.600]  But here's what's going on right now.
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:51.402]  The Democratic Party is shifting, because of her, and she's being called by Perez and others, the voice of the Democratic Party.
[03:38:51.402 --> 03:38:53.642]  It's racing towards extreme leftism.
[03:38:53.642 --> 03:38:54.863]  Yes!
[03:38:54.863 --> 03:39:00.364]  And what happens is now, one of two things, maybe, because with Hillary, you gotta think,
[03:39:01.676 --> 03:39:04.338]  Don't ever think anything's just inadvertent.
[03:39:04.338 --> 03:39:14.663]  Could this be this crazy, careening out of control, left-wing faction of the Democratic Party, to which people will say, Hillary, we need you to pivot and carry on?
[03:39:14.663 --> 03:39:20.346]  Exactly like she did with exactly, like they're letting it go that direction, so she's the savior.
[03:39:20.346 --> 03:39:23.028]  So she could be the stalking horse, or she could be the sheepdog, whatever it is.
[03:39:23.028 --> 03:39:25.529]  She could be the rodeo clown, whatever you want to call this.
[03:39:25.529 --> 03:39:30.312]  But what I don't understand is how anyone
[03:39:31.535 --> 03:39:45.026]  How President Trump, or anybody for that matter, can allow this woman to remain, to remain... By the way, Godwin has taken over you.
[03:39:45.026 --> 03:39:54.533]  The Godwin principle has taken over, apparently, the Alex Jones Show, as we, of course, are going more Hitlerian in your particular cartoon annotations.
[03:39:54.533 --> 03:39:59.877]  That notwithstanding, what I'm wondering is how in the world has she escaped
[03:40:00.743 --> 03:40:02.468]  Not only that, I want you to see this.
[03:40:02.468 --> 03:40:03.570]  This is great.
[03:40:03.570 --> 03:40:05.555]  The mind of a killer.
[03:40:05.555 --> 03:40:05.776]  Okay.
[03:40:06.807 --> 03:40:08.568]  How has she escaped, Alex?
[03:40:08.568 --> 03:40:10.049]  Any kind of prosecution?
[03:40:10.049 --> 03:40:10.910]  For anything?
[03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:14.632]  The Clinton Health Access Initiative, the Clinton Global Initiative, the Clinton Foundation.
[03:40:14.632 --> 03:40:17.414]  All of those countries, all of those people, all of those individuals.
[03:40:17.414 --> 03:40:19.295]  She, I don't think, has ever been audited.
[03:40:19.295 --> 03:40:20.516]  How does that work?
[03:40:20.516 --> 03:40:21.717]  Plus everything.
[03:40:21.717 --> 03:40:22.798]  We can go through the litany.
[03:40:22.798 --> 03:40:24.279]  You don't need to have me say this.
[03:40:24.279 --> 03:40:26.961]  But how does this even happen?
[03:40:26.961 --> 03:40:28.882]  Where she hasn't even gotten a parking ticket.
[03:40:28.882 --> 03:40:30.143]  Not even a misdemeanor.
[03:40:30.143 --> 03:40:33.725]  How can anybody in their right mind look at this and say, you're doing a great job?
[03:40:33.725 --> 03:40:34.906]  Although you've got a real talent.
[03:40:35.675 --> 03:40:38.816]  Is that some kind of an MS-13 teardrop there?
[03:40:38.816 --> 03:40:39.716]  Is that what that is?
[03:40:39.716 --> 03:40:40.616]  Okay, very good.
[03:40:40.616 --> 03:40:45.678]  And what's that in Bill Clinton's lap?
[03:40:45.678 --> 03:40:47.798]  Uh, I don't even want to think.
[03:40:47.798 --> 03:40:51.640]  It's some one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people here.
[03:40:51.640 --> 03:40:52.460]  That's right.
[03:40:52.460 --> 03:40:56.761]  Or, now let me ask you, did you see the particular book he was perusing on the flight?
[03:40:56.761 --> 03:40:58.181]  I don't know what that means.
[03:40:58.181 --> 03:40:59.462]  Oh, they always have some message.
[03:40:59.462 --> 03:40:59.942]  What was it?
[03:41:00.831 --> 03:41:02.772]  Well, this was apparently... Little Orphan Annie?
[03:41:02.772 --> 03:41:05.313]  Maybe a Jerry Epstein's Lolita Express?
[03:41:05.313 --> 03:41:07.593]  Was it... No, no, I've got it right here.
[03:41:07.593 --> 03:41:09.014]  12-year-olds or what was it?
[03:41:09.014 --> 03:41:11.735]  Well, not per se.
[03:41:11.735 --> 03:41:13.036]  It was very interesting.
[03:41:13.036 --> 03:41:14.376]  I have it here.
[03:41:14.376 --> 03:41:17.217]  And by the by, let me just also throw something out there.
[03:41:17.217 --> 03:41:20.818]  Just because, you know, it never ceases to amaze me.
[03:41:20.818 --> 03:41:24.180]  The... Hang on a second.
[03:41:24.180 --> 03:41:27.541]  Oh, this is Crimson Lake by Candice Fox.
[03:41:28.723 --> 03:41:31.988]  This is where he's accused but not convicted of a brutal abduction.
[03:41:31.988 --> 03:41:35.173]  Ted is now a free man and a public enemy, number one.
[03:41:35.173 --> 03:41:40.241]  Oh my God, so he's got a prisoner book or a fugitive thing.
[03:41:40.241 --> 03:41:43.526]  Like, we're the people accused of stuff but we haven't done it.
[03:41:44.226 --> 03:41:45.847]  Unbelievable!
[03:41:45.847 --> 03:41:48.449]  Everything with him is always a message.
[03:41:48.449 --> 03:41:51.852]  It's also a reference, of course, to some abduction or whatever.
[03:41:51.852 --> 03:42:08.904]  And do we also hear about this incredible turn of events in our neighboring New Jersey, Alex, of a woman who apparently was going to testify this coming week before a grand jury regarding some improprieties on the part of her, whose house blew up, and her husband as well.
[03:42:08.904 --> 03:42:10.185]  You can't miss this.
[03:42:11.515 --> 03:42:18.381]  Let me ask you that question selfishly when we come back, because you are a former criminal prosecutor and a really smart fish.
[03:42:18.381 --> 03:42:20.523]  A lot of people ask why I'm still alive.
[03:42:20.523 --> 03:42:23.486]  They thought if Hillary won, she'd just persecute me, and she is persecuting me.
[03:42:23.486 --> 03:42:25.648]  Three of her affiliated law firms are suing me.
[03:42:25.648 --> 03:42:27.649]  But a lot of smart money ask why I'm not dead.
[03:42:27.649 --> 03:42:31.453]  They think it's because there's a surveillance state, and they know Trump's watching, and that's too much for her to do.
[03:42:31.453 --> 03:42:34.275]  But they do kill so many people, blow up so many houses.
[03:42:34.275 --> 03:42:35.416]  I mean, they're thugs.
[03:42:35.416 --> 03:42:37.038]  Why has she not killed me yet?
[03:42:37.518 --> 03:42:43.283]  I mean, that's a real question, and I think some people think she wants to slowly destroy me first.
[03:42:43.283 --> 03:42:47.347]  Like a spider kind of ties up its victim first, lets them hang there a while before they do it.
[03:42:47.347 --> 03:42:50.230]  Then long before that, Hillary will be bye-bye.

[03:44:02.210 --> 03:44:13.040]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:44:13.040 --> 03:44:15.161]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:44:15.161 --> 03:44:19.165]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:19.165 --> 03:44:20.366]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[03:44:20.606 --> 03:44:26.190]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine.
[03:44:26.190 --> 03:44:28.792]  I think you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:44:28.792 --> 03:44:31.433]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[03:44:31.433 --> 03:44:34.235]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:44:34.235 --> 03:44:36.737]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:36.737 --> 03:44:45.923]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:44:45.923 --> 03:44:50.366]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[03:44:54.128 --> 03:45:04.735]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.735 --> 03:45:06.796]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:45:06.796 --> 03:45:09.658]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.658 --> 03:45:11.159]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:11.159 --> 03:45:11.279]  It's
[03:45:11.459 --> 03:45:11.719]  I think?
[03:45:34.909 --> 03:45:46.574]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:45:46.574 --> 03:45:49.875]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.

[03:46:00.283 --> 03:46:03.507]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[03:46:03.507 --> 03:46:07.210]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:46:07.210 --> 03:46:11.915]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:46:11.915 --> 03:46:15.178]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:46:16.059 --> 03:46:27.066]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:46:27.066 --> 03:46:35.592]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[03:46:37.233 --> 03:46:46.278]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[03:46:50.580 --> 03:46:51.861]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:05.786 --> 03:47:18.017]  And now Lionel of Lionel.com is in the final segment before we kick off the war room.
[03:47:18.017 --> 03:47:22.341]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:30.106 --> 03:47:42.737]  Lionel, I want you to get to some of the other areas you wanted to break down here before we end this hour and the war room starts, which is going to be extended coverage right through Trump's announcement, 8 o'clock Central, 9 o'clock Eastern, on the Supreme Court nominee.
[03:47:42.737 --> 03:47:45.239]  But just separately... Sorry, go ahead.
[03:47:45.239 --> 03:47:45.619]  Oh, no, no.
[03:47:45.619 --> 03:47:48.362]  First of all, it's lionelmedia.com.
[03:47:48.362 --> 03:47:49.223]  That's okay.
[03:47:49.223 --> 03:47:51.004]  Lionel.com?
[03:47:51.004 --> 03:47:52.045]  I've been saying Lionel.
[03:47:52.045 --> 03:47:52.806]  I wonder what that is.
[03:47:54.818 --> 03:47:57.159]  Maybe the train cop, I don't know, I'm just guessing.
[03:47:57.159 --> 03:48:00.061]  Vinylmedia.com, I know that, I go to the site all the time.
[03:48:00.061 --> 03:48:02.222]  And how do people follow you on Twitter?
[03:48:02.222 --> 03:48:23.193]  But you know, Alex, the thing that I wanted to talk about, which I think is even more fascinating, is this idea, and I know that we've talked about it, is that when you have an organization like Twitter or Facebook, who decides to wipe out, let's say, 70 million accounts because they are fake, for whatever it's reason, whatever criteria they use, and say, these are indeed fake, these are fake, and that's where they'll pay fine.
[03:48:23.193 --> 03:48:24.314]  The question then becomes,
[03:48:25.734 --> 03:48:30.878]  Do we have any duty, or do they have any duty, to provide news to us?
[03:48:30.878 --> 03:48:37.924]  If you say, wait a minute, you're basically destroying my account, and you're also keeping news from me.
[03:48:37.924 --> 03:48:41.287]  Do I have a First Amendment right or cause of action against you?
[03:48:41.287 --> 03:48:50.795]  And what Twitter and Facebook... And the answer is yes, because they and Facebook and Google, which have said, we are a public commons, we're a utility, leave us alone.
[03:48:51.255 --> 03:48:52.315]  Let us grow.
[03:48:52.315 --> 03:48:53.736]  Let us be ubiquitous.
[03:48:53.736 --> 03:48:55.736]  But then they jump back and say, we're a private corporation.
[03:48:55.736 --> 03:48:56.157]  You can't.
[03:48:56.157 --> 03:49:01.678]  Then they selectively interpret rules and let the leftist engage in all these discriminatory practices.
[03:49:01.678 --> 03:49:06.620]  But then anybody that's nationalist, conservative, even anti-war, classical liberals, they're all banned.
[03:49:07.881 --> 03:49:15.051]  But then when also they're using bots that look for a particular type of Russian ideology or Russian... No, no, no, no, no.
[03:49:15.051 --> 03:49:16.433]  It's beyond that.
[03:49:16.433 --> 03:49:23.503]  If you've got a Facebook page with a couple million likes and some account connected somehow to Russia,
[03:49:24.548 --> 03:49:25.409]  Comments!
[03:49:25.409 --> 03:49:27.370]  You're now a Russian agent.
[03:49:27.370 --> 03:49:31.994]  Even though the Democrats, as you know, did 80% of the spending in Russia to get around campaign finance laws.
[03:49:31.994 --> 03:49:34.055]  England's the big place, Canada doesn't.
[03:49:34.055 --> 03:49:37.898]  Everyone runs over to these foreign PR companies.
[03:49:37.898 --> 03:49:39.279]  Anybody can hire them.
[03:49:39.279 --> 03:49:42.902]  And then Democrats were spending 80% of the money in Russia.
[03:49:42.902 --> 03:49:43.783]  They spent it, wasn't much.
[03:49:44.907 --> 03:49:46.607]  It was like a couple hundred million views or something.
[03:49:46.607 --> 03:49:47.267]  It was nothing.
[03:49:47.267 --> 03:49:49.808]  And then Trump had something like eight million views or something.
[03:49:49.808 --> 03:49:50.748]  It was nothing.
[03:49:50.748 --> 03:49:51.568]  It was nothing.
[03:49:51.568 --> 03:49:52.649]  It was nothing.
[03:49:52.649 --> 03:49:53.969]  But yeah, here's an example.
[03:49:53.969 --> 03:50:03.651]  CNN goes and harasses a lady saying her local pro-Trump group isn't real because a Russian account that they say is a bot account commented on her.
[03:50:03.651 --> 03:50:03.991]  Go ahead.
[03:50:03.991 --> 03:50:05.571]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[03:50:05.571 --> 03:50:07.411]  Oh, no, no, you're not ranting.
[03:50:07.411 --> 03:50:10.772]  But what they'll do is, or if you happen to use
[03:50:11.531 --> 03:50:11.752]  I don't
[03:50:26.755 --> 03:50:33.717]  Which is Russian state run and said, we want you to spend, you know, $50 million or whatever it was in the election to push your traffic and make money.
[03:50:33.717 --> 03:50:35.837]  They said, no, we'll do a test deal.
[03:50:35.837 --> 03:50:37.098]  It was for like a half million.
[03:50:37.098 --> 03:50:38.758]  And they didn't even like the response.
[03:50:38.758 --> 03:50:47.381]  They then used Twitter targeting RT articles, and I think are too liberal, by the way, as the proof of Russian collusion in a media buy.
[03:50:47.381 --> 03:50:49.661]  That's how it works.
[03:50:49.661 --> 03:50:52.202]  But Russia, but Twitter went to RT.
[03:50:53.423 --> 03:50:58.907]  Alex, let's assume that I happen to own the rights or the patents to a particular type of ink
[03:51:17.828 --> 03:51:23.290]  That is in 95% of all newspapers during an era where we use newspapers.
[03:51:23.290 --> 03:51:24.910]  And I'm a private company.
[03:51:24.910 --> 03:51:26.971]  But I happen to make this ink.
[03:51:26.971 --> 03:51:27.831]  I'm the only one who does.
[03:51:27.831 --> 03:51:29.391]  And I decide not to sell you ink.
[03:51:29.391 --> 03:51:34.273]  That's the ultimate argument of how they're violating the First Amendment with their monopoly.
[03:51:34.273 --> 03:51:34.793]  Exactly.
[03:51:34.793 --> 03:51:41.475]  What I'm doing is I just basically wiped out 95%, or better yet, I say I'm selling it to everybody except you.
[03:51:42.242 --> 03:51:44.284]  Now, this is the bottom line.
[03:51:44.284 --> 03:51:45.305]  Wait, I interrupted you.
[03:51:45.305 --> 03:51:48.827]  I want to make this like a one minute YouTube, Twitter, viral video.
[03:51:48.827 --> 03:51:49.348]  Start over.
[03:51:49.348 --> 03:51:50.329]  I interrupted.
[03:51:50.329 --> 03:51:50.909]  Everybody needs it.
[03:51:50.909 --> 03:51:51.930]  We're going to use this.
[03:51:51.930 --> 03:51:54.112]  This is the best allegory, best analogy.
[03:51:54.112 --> 03:51:56.494]  Take your time without me on the screen.
[03:51:56.494 --> 03:52:00.717]  Lionel of LionelMedia.com, not Lionel.com, LionelMedia.com.
[03:52:00.717 --> 03:52:01.478]  Great brain.
[03:52:01.478 --> 03:52:02.899]  Start over.
[03:52:02.899 --> 03:52:03.059]  Okay.
[03:52:03.934 --> 03:52:16.382]  Assume that during the era of newspapers, I'm a company that happens to make an ink, the only ink that is used in 95% of all newspapers.
[03:52:16.382 --> 03:52:30.471]  And then for some reason or another, I decide, as a private company, that I'm not going to sell this ink to you, and to you, and to you, and maybe 50% of all the newspapers in the country that I disagree with politically.
[03:52:30.931 --> 03:52:36.775]  They turn around and say, in effect, I have denied them their ability to express themselves.
[03:52:36.775 --> 03:52:41.098]  I turn around and say, no, I'm a private company, a private concern.
[03:52:41.098 --> 03:52:50.085]  I am not susceptible to the protections of the First Amendment because I'm just a private person who can elect, for a variety of reasons, not to sell to you.
[03:52:50.085 --> 03:52:54.348]  But by virtue of my positioning, I've just eliminated
[03:52:54.995 --> 03:52:59.538]  There are swaths of information, of expression, individually.
[03:52:59.538 --> 03:53:04.242]  Not to mention if there's any kind of a corporate or I should say federal collusion.
[03:53:04.242 --> 03:53:08.865]  And now we've got the Sherman Antitrust Act since 1906 and everything.
[03:53:08.865 --> 03:53:17.551]  Clearly, Google saying that all Republican candidates are Nazis when you search their name is the first search result in the official Google thing.
[03:53:17.551 --> 03:53:19.433]  This isn't just monopoly practices.
[03:53:19.733 --> 03:53:24.660]  They're using the monopoly to then engage in weaponized propaganda and lies.
[03:53:24.660 --> 03:53:35.076]  So as a smart guy and a media analyst and a former prosecutor, what does Trump, what do we need to do to stop this clear monopoly being used to try to overtake our republic?
[03:53:35.842 --> 03:53:49.113]  What we do and what we hope for is a new and enlightened Supreme Court or a new American jurisprudence and juridicature to look at this and realize that today the rules are going to have to change.
[03:53:49.113 --> 03:53:59.422]  What was a quaint little social media platform, what was interesting before in Facebook and all of that, now happens to be the sole means by which people get the news.
[03:53:59.422 --> 03:54:00.283]  And not only that, Alex.
[03:54:00.663 --> 03:54:05.626]  When I turn around and I say that you are fake news, I've just disparaged you.
[03:54:05.626 --> 03:54:07.107]  This is corporate libel.
[03:54:07.107 --> 03:54:11.069]  I've just said that what you are saying cannot be trusted.
[03:54:11.069 --> 03:54:15.412]  So not only have I limited your particular range, I've said that you are fake.
[03:54:15.412 --> 03:54:16.152]  That's the key.
[03:54:16.152 --> 03:54:20.255]  They take our speech, then they misrepresent us and strangle us in the dark.
[03:54:21.463 --> 03:54:45.538]  Exactly and all of these rules in the past about what private ownership is and whether it's there's state entanglement or federal involvement that has to change right now in this and that by the way goes to show you that these nice and quaint little statements about how the Constitution is not a living and breathing or instrument it is because right now if I sat down going back
[03:54:45.538 --> 03:54:50.200]  We're back to the days of Madison and Jefferson, and I tried to explain social media.
[03:54:50.200 --> 03:54:54.142]  They would think you were a Martian from Pluto with 14 heads.
[03:54:54.142 --> 03:55:09.569]  But you're the lawyer, but explain this to me, because I'm a strict constructionist from what I've read and studied, but you have to take the original intent and follow then the rulings and the changes and try to express the original intent of human empowerment and liberty, but in the modern context.
[03:55:10.788 --> 03:55:11.388]  Right.
[03:55:11.388 --> 03:55:23.455]  And what they will do is they will say to you, Alex, being a strict constructionist and originalist, they will say Congress shall pass no law using the state via the 14th Amendment through the incorporation by reference doctrine.
[03:55:23.455 --> 03:55:31.260]  They will say Congress and the government, they are the people who can basically infringe upon you and impinge upon your rights.
[03:55:31.260 --> 03:55:33.902]  So they would use a strict constructionist rule.
[03:55:33.902 --> 03:55:37.644]  People were ignorant to actually allow everything after that to not have a constitutional authority.
[03:55:37.964 --> 03:55:42.167]  But how do you use them not being strict constructionists then, besides living, breathing, take the guns?
[03:55:42.167 --> 03:55:48.613]  Well clearly the people shall not be infringed, but then in a modern sense, you've got to then express that into the modern template.
[03:55:49.255 --> 03:55:50.796]  Okay, but here's the switch though.
[03:55:50.796 --> 03:55:54.818]  When you go back and look at the legislative history of this and you say, where did these come from?
[03:55:54.818 --> 03:55:58.759]  Where did Google and Facebook, through DARPA, through government feeder systems?
[03:55:58.759 --> 03:56:04.042]  I would respectfully submit that the government is indeed the silent partner of these.
[03:56:04.042 --> 03:56:05.583]  So you have this connection.
[03:56:05.583 --> 03:56:07.063]  What you just said is incredible.
[03:56:07.063 --> 03:56:08.204]  I know for a fact.
[03:56:09.209 --> 03:56:17.113]  That it was Trump, we broke this days before Bloomberg did, that went in and said, all these thousands of conservative accounts, unban them.
[03:56:17.113 --> 03:56:19.214]  They totally banned us, then they went to shadow ban.
[03:56:19.214 --> 03:56:25.397]  But didn't you tell the CIA, the NSA did create Google 20 years ago.
[03:56:25.397 --> 03:56:30.459]  And so what you said is absolutely profound, because that is indeed the case.
[03:56:30.459 --> 03:56:32.660]  So that makes it beyond a monopoly.
[03:56:32.660 --> 03:56:38.503]  It's the state operating a monopoly, hiding behind the fact that it's corporate, towards a larger goal.
[03:56:39.761 --> 03:56:45.222]  You would submit that Facebook and Google and Twitter are the government.
[03:56:45.222 --> 03:56:46.842]  The government's a silent partner.
[03:56:46.842 --> 03:56:48.543]  It's like when the mob ran the Teamsters.
[03:56:48.543 --> 03:56:50.603]  It's when the mob ran Vegas.
[03:56:50.603 --> 03:56:54.924]  We pierced that veil, that corporate veil, that fiction.
[03:56:54.924 --> 03:57:05.065]  So what happens is we need people to understand that right now these incredible organizations, Facebook and others, this is not some quaint little picture of somebody and their little pet dog.
[03:57:05.065 --> 03:57:07.846]  This was DARPA created internet to take over the world.
[03:57:08.678 --> 03:57:14.942]  And the government is the silent partner, that this is subterfuge, this is pretext, that this is exactly what's going on.
[03:57:14.942 --> 03:57:29.272]  Therefore, by virtue of the aforementioned... Therefore, it's deep state rebellion against President Trump and the American people, and this isn't just government, it's rogue groups with corporations getting filthy rich, robbing taxpayer money and public utilities, and they need to be taken away from their mutinous asses.
[03:57:30.192 --> 03:57:36.040]  And the First Amendment applies, and it's a violation of our First Amendment rights, plain and simple.
[03:57:36.040 --> 03:57:38.082]  That was a Grand Slam segment.
[03:57:38.082 --> 03:57:40.766]  Lionel will be back tonight during the coverage of the SCOTUSpic.
[03:57:40.766 --> 03:57:42.388]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:57:42.388 --> 03:57:43.109]  Amazing.
[03:57:43.109 --> 03:57:43.930]  War Room's up next.
[03:57:43.930 --> 03:57:48.535]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:57:48.535 --> 03:57:48.996]  Thanks for holding.
[03:57:49.056 --> 03:57:50.498]  Hey Alex, mate.
[03:57:50.498 --> 03:57:54.123]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:57:54.123 --> 03:58:04.477]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books.
[03:58:04.597 --> 03:58:05.358]  Thank you, brother.
[03:58:19.654 --> 03:58:28.239]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:58:28.239 --> 03:58:33.143]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:58:33.143 --> 03:58:38.746]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1775th Worldwide.
[03:58:44.491 --> 03:58:48.473]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[03:58:48.473 --> 03:58:51.214]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[03:58:51.214 --> 03:58:56.016]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[03:58:56.016 --> 03:58:58.437]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
