[01:06.200 --> 01:12.120]  radical Muslim refugee taught that the crucifixion basically never happened or at the very least
[01:12.120 --> 01:17.960]  its meaning is completely different than the Christian understanding nevertheless Spiesa
[01:17.960 --> 01:24.120]  reports Pope Francis washed and kissed the feet of 12 young asylum seekers to show the
[01:24.120 --> 01:30.240]  international community the importance of providing refugees shelter said an official in the Vatican

[01:42.000 --> 01:49.280]  Belgian police hunt down more suspects in the recent Brussels bombing meanwhile Europe shell
[01:49.280 --> 01:54.400]  shocked by the attacks in Paris and Brussels succumbs to the will of their radicalized
[01:54.400 --> 02:01.160]  foreign invaders where Stockholm syndrome is literally exploding as the Gateway Pundit reports

[02:46.840 --> 02:52.360]  attacks the terror group has apparently deployed interlocking terror cells like the ones that
[02:52.360 --> 02:59.640]  struck in Brussels in Paris with chilling orders to choose the time place and method for maximum
[02:59.640 --> 03:05.520]  carnage is that any wonder why the far-rights numbers in Europe are skyrocketing as average
[03:05.520 --> 03:11.840]  Europeans out of sheer desperation are rushing by any means necessary to defend their nation

[04:05.000 --> 04:10.800]  sustained interest in strengthening nuclear security Amano said the countries which do not
[04:10.800 --> 04:16.960]  recognize the danger of nuclear terrorism is the biggest problem Amano's comments came before
[04:16.960 --> 04:22.680]  summit of around 50 leaders in Washington on ensuring that nuclear material in the world's
[04:22.680 --> 04:29.000]  roughly 1000 atomic facilities are secured the Brussels bombers may have been very close to

[04:57.440 --> 05:03.320]  the FBI will soon interview Hillary Clinton over her private email server federal prosecutors
[05:03.320 --> 05:07.640]  investigating the likely mishandling of classified materials on Clinton's server are already setting
[05:07.640 --> 05:11.960]  up formal interviews with some of her closest aides according to insiders which indicates the
[05:11.960 --> 05:16.800]  FBI investigation is nearing its final phases these interviews will take several weeks according
[05:16.800 --> 05:21.120]  to the LA Times meaning that the scandal will continue to play Clinton throughout her presidential
[05:21.120 --> 05:26.120]  run back in 2009 your diplomatic security officials had an issue with Clinton even using her
[05:26.120 --> 05:31.040]  blackberry device in a secure office worried that foreign spies could hack it and transform the
[05:31.040 --> 05:35.600]  blackberry into a listening device little did they know that her blackberry was connected to
[05:35.600 --> 05:40.360]  her private unsecured email server where she kept highly classified documents including material
[05:40.360 --> 05:44.800]  labeled beyond top secret of course security officials had no way of doing anything about it
[05:44.800 --> 05:48.960]  because they had no idea the server even existed and that's the point the server allowed Clinton
[05:48.960 --> 05:53.720]  to avoid releasing emails to the public as part of the Freedom of Information Act this is Kit Daniels

[08:00.560 --> 08:26.560]  we now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance it's alex jones
[08:26.560 --> 08:31.560]  there's a lot of things happening in this world a lot of people are waking up a lot of people are getting involved
[08:31.560 --> 08:39.560]  a lot of people are figuring out there is a global shadow corporate government that has an ideology of anti-human enslavement
[08:39.560 --> 08:47.560]  but so many others in the west have been brought up with so much they take it for granted
[08:47.560 --> 08:57.560]  and there is a cynical arrogant arrested development attitude in a lot of people out there that nothing really matters
[08:57.560 --> 09:06.560]  and that's because they never been put in a position where they do realize how much basic freedoms or things like shelter do matter
[09:06.560 --> 09:11.560]  and when this economy completely collapses which is being designed to do
[09:11.560 --> 09:18.560]  it is going to be like a bomb going off with the masses and masses of millennials and others
[09:18.560 --> 09:25.560]  who in national polls what 56% last week in a Gallup poll of college students across the country
[09:25.560 --> 09:33.560]  said that they support socialism and that they want Bernie Sanders
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.560]  here it is in my stack of news today from Bloomberg Business
[09:37.560 --> 09:48.560]  how a Venezuelan opposition leader secretly communicates from solitary confinement over the last two years
[09:48.560 --> 09:53.560]  this is Leopoldo Lopez and he was in the polls and set to win an election
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.560]  so what they do there is they just arrest you and throw you in prison in a military brig
[09:59.560 --> 10:04.560]  and then start attacking and arresting the supporters
[10:04.560 --> 10:09.560]  you see the communists are about to win in Venezuela because they haven't been prosperous in about 30 years
[10:09.560 --> 10:12.560]  since they got away from quasi capitalism
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.560]  there was still some oligarchs and corruption obviously
[10:17.560 --> 10:22.560]  they have to go a few more decades and just exterminate any memory that there was once property
[10:22.560 --> 10:29.560]  or there was once food there was once store shelves filled that houses weren't collapsing
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.560]  and so they're moving into the phase of arresting everybody
[10:33.560 --> 10:39.560]  of course Hugo Chavez got into office claiming he was just a socialist how dare anyone say he was a communist
[10:39.560 --> 10:50.560]  and his last four or five years in office he began obviously wearing red shirts and saying yes I'm a communist
[10:50.560 --> 10:58.560]  and it's like Bernie Sanders saying to Donald Trump how dare you say I'm a communist
[10:58.560 --> 11:03.560]  socialism creates generations of domesticated populations
[11:03.560 --> 11:11.560]  it has elites that are basically exempt from the rules and laws that control who distributes the taxes
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.560]  socialism starts at 50 60 70% it's never enough there's always got to be more
[11:16.560 --> 11:22.560]  until they start taxing the producers 90% and things collapse
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.560]  so Davos and the other globalist organizations say the answer is a planetary
[11:28.560 --> 11:39.560]  worldwide government where there are no quote tax avoidance havens now the United States is the supposed tax avoidance haven
[11:39.560 --> 11:50.560]  and the average person making above $50,000 a year ends up paying around 65% in some form of tax
[11:50.560 --> 11:57.560]  people making less than 50 down to about 35 it varies but they're not paying very high federal taxes
[11:57.560 --> 12:02.560]  but you're paying a bunch of other taxes even if you're a renter you're paying property taxes through it
[12:02.560 --> 12:10.560]  all the excise taxes the franchise taxes the sales taxes the fines the fees the taxes tagged on to most services
[12:10.560 --> 12:18.560]  like your cable bill your phone bill your electricity bill I mean taxes are designed to be hidden from the general population
[12:18.560 --> 12:24.560]  but they don't understand why their paycheck doesn't go anywhere but then they hear on the news don't worry
[12:24.560 --> 12:31.560]  Bernie Sanders is going to give you free college don't worry you're going to get your student loans written off
[12:31.560 --> 12:37.560]  actually they say we're going to give you two years of free college but then increase the price of the other two years
[12:37.560 --> 12:43.560]  and then make you sign on to basically do government service in the future to keep you in the cult
[12:43.560 --> 12:51.560]  so now it's from age three with head start to let's say 22 to 24 to 26 getting out of college
[12:51.560 --> 12:57.560]  and then you've got to go serve the government that gave you the free education but really it was the citizens
[12:57.560 --> 13:03.560]  paying taxes that gave you the quote free education but it wasn't free because now you are an indoctrinated slave
[13:03.560 --> 13:10.560]  who isn't out of government service till you're 28 to 30 years old
[13:10.560 --> 13:18.560]  and by then you're so brainwashed so put into political correct cult that you don't know how to operate outside in the real world
[13:18.560 --> 13:24.560]  you've been institutionalized just like the institutionalized people putting them in prison when they're 14
[13:24.560 --> 13:30.560]  they may go in as good kids they come out of juvie at 18 hardened criminals and they got a record and it's the only education
[13:30.560 --> 13:36.560]  or family they know as those gangs well the softer version of that is going to college
[13:36.560 --> 13:42.560]  and high school and the rest of it from the time you're in elementary school right through the state involved in your life
[13:42.560 --> 13:53.560]  what are your parents doing what are they saying what's going on don't use this word don't use that word
[13:53.560 --> 14:01.560]  it's amazing I'm going to get into obviously all the huge news here in just a moment but
[14:01.560 --> 14:08.560]  they have the young people they absolutely have them in a stranglehold now there is a minority of young people
[14:08.560 --> 14:13.560]  that are more awake than any other generation out there they're amazing
[14:13.560 --> 14:19.560]  and they've got a lot of the older folks that are basically just just trying to hit retirement and just want to go play golf
[14:19.560 --> 14:26.560]  and just don't care and think they're insulated and just hope everything will turn out okay
[14:26.560 --> 14:35.560]  but it is the generation below the baby boomers you call it generation acts or whatever you want to
[14:35.560 --> 14:41.560]  that is going to pay for everything we're going to pay for the spoiled children we're going to pay for our parents
[14:41.560 --> 14:46.560]  we're going to pay for the social security that was already stolen we are the ones that are to be totally
[14:46.560 --> 14:52.560]  and completely targeted in the government's own admissions
[14:52.560 --> 14:58.560]  and then there'll be a rebellion against the old people and then they'll bring in the euthanasia
[14:58.560 --> 15:03.560]  and there'll be a rebellion against all the young spoiled brats and when they're done reorganizing the economy
[15:03.560 --> 15:11.560]  the new ruling class will be generation acts killing the old people and putting the spoiled rotten millennials in forced labor camps
[15:11.560 --> 15:17.560]  now that's what they've got set up in the social engineering hope you all enjoy it
[15:17.560 --> 15:25.560]  I don't want to be part of this but this is what's been set up
[15:25.560 --> 15:35.560]  and the arrogance of young people is amazing
[15:35.560 --> 15:43.560]  I was talking to a longtime family friend yesterday she was over my parents for Easter
[15:43.560 --> 15:50.560]  and she was talking about her granddaughter that she's driving around to look at different colleges
[15:50.560 --> 15:57.560]  because she just got out of high school when it was 18 and I've known her granddaughter since she was born
[15:57.560 --> 16:01.560]  because I've known her mother since she was born
[16:01.560 --> 16:06.560]  there were family friends like when I was two years old across the streets our family stayed friends
[16:06.560 --> 16:17.560]  the last really I guess 40 years I've known her and she's what you'd call liberal but you know common sense type old-fashioned liberal
[16:17.560 --> 16:23.560]  and she's been driving around all these colleges around Texas with her granddaughter who's half white half black
[16:23.560 --> 16:32.560]  and she said she almost cried because from the social justice warrior stuff
[16:32.560 --> 16:38.560]  she was basically saying to her grandma are you racist because you're white
[16:38.560 --> 16:44.560]  and was just spewing Bernie Sanders stuff at her in socialism and you're racist if you're not for socialism
[16:44.560 --> 16:47.560]  and she's not even for Donald Trump but she's trying to explain to her
[16:47.560 --> 16:51.560]  they're demonizing him for stuff that's nothing compared to what other people are saying and doing
[16:51.560 --> 16:55.560]  and it's the establishment that's upset at him because they don't control him
[16:55.560 --> 17:03.560]  and she just felt like she had this power over her that she had the moral authority to say you must be bad
[17:03.560 --> 17:08.560]  because you know you just can't be listened to because you're white
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.560]  this is somebody that's taken care of her whole life somebody that pays for stuff for loves her
[17:14.560 --> 17:19.560]  she's a sweet girl she's been on the ski boat with us many times over the years camping you name it
[17:19.560 --> 17:24.560]  young lady now but it's the peer pressure and it's the colleges and it's the authority figures
[17:24.560 --> 17:30.560]  they are jacking people's brains folks ruining them
[17:30.560 --> 17:38.560]  and people think they're going to be successful by identifying with a group and being obsessed with all the weird political correctness
[17:38.560 --> 17:46.560]  and you pay for college to victimize your children and grandchildren to induct them into these cults
[17:46.560 --> 17:52.560]  it's very sad very very sad and not the conservatism modern conservatism is perfect
[17:52.560 --> 17:56.560]  but if you are going to pay for your kids or grandkids to go to school control it
[17:56.560 --> 18:01.560]  don't just send them where they want to go send them to a Christian school or a conservative school
[18:01.560 --> 18:06.560]  or one that doesn't brainwash because a lot of these big colleges that are trying to brainwash everybody
[18:06.560 --> 18:10.560]  they're having very very low attendance rates they're falling apart and that's good
[18:10.560 --> 18:15.560]  the answer is pull out of this look it feels good to have a degree and feel like you did something
[18:15.560 --> 18:20.560]  they sell that idea 90% of the degrees you get aren't worth the paper they're written on
[18:20.560 --> 18:24.560]  there isn't going to be that economy there when you get out it already doesn't exist
[18:24.560 --> 18:29.560]  they admit it's a giant bubble it's been a fraud for 20 years now it's a total fraud
[18:29.560 --> 18:35.560]  unless you're really sharp and you're going to get top of the class in law school or engineering
[18:35.560 --> 18:38.560]  and more importantly you're going to play golf with the professors
[18:38.560 --> 18:42.560]  and you're going to go get their dirty laundry for them and you're going to kiss their butt
[18:42.560 --> 18:47.560]  and you're going to go intern and most interns just sit there and don't realize they're like trying to get a job
[18:47.560 --> 18:50.560]  they just think oh I just sit here people sit there and watch you to see what you're going to do
[18:50.560 --> 18:55.560]  you have to be charming you have to be hardworking you have to be smart you got to be willing to bust your ass
[18:55.560 --> 19:00.560]  I'm telling you these millennials they get a job they just think people are nice to them
[19:00.560 --> 19:03.560]  that's what the slackerism is all about you'll see it in Austin it's incredible
[19:03.560 --> 19:09.560]  they think that they're entitled and that if you're even trying to get them to work or do something
[19:09.560 --> 19:14.560]  you're oppressing them it's scary
[19:14.560 --> 19:17.560]  now there it is at Mizzou to close two dorms because of enrollment drop
[19:17.560 --> 19:23.560]  I mean people don't want to be told they can't go on the green or walk around the school or be screamed at

[24:50.560 --> 24:56.560]  fullwars.com remember he told you months before and then a week before that Jeb Bush
[24:56.560 --> 25:03.560]  would be endorsing Cruz well Walker will endorse Cruz in Wisconsin push the big
[25:03.560 --> 25:10.560]  steal is on the Bush Cruz Rubio Romney Ryan McConnell faction is united and is
[25:10.560 --> 25:13.560]  moving into high gear to steal the nomination from Trump we're going to get into that
[25:13.560 --> 25:18.560]  news is joining us in the third hour security experts Ted Cruz appears to be
[25:18.560 --> 25:24.560]  deceptive in his response to sex scandal hashtag Cuban mistress crisis you know
[25:24.560 --> 25:32.560]  here's the deal he didn't say it's all lies he said it's garbage and the evidence
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.560]  is pretty clear that they were separated for several years the evidence is clear
[25:36.560 --> 25:41.560]  that he basically left his girls up in DC that's why they don't like him the evidence
[25:41.560 --> 25:45.560]  is clear that I don't think I've ever seen the inquire wrong people mix it in with
[25:45.560 --> 25:49.560]  bat boy and news of the world always here oh Alex says the inquirers really
[25:49.560 --> 25:55.560]  accurate what the bat boy at the Capitol they don't do bat boy or meteor coming to
[25:55.560 --> 26:02.560]  kill us the inquirer does cover dirt on Hollywood and stuff and I don't
[26:02.560 --> 26:06.560]  particularly follow that but when it gets to politicians Bill Clinton and
[26:06.560 --> 26:13.560]  Monica Lewinsky and the Republican sex candles the Democratic sex candles I
[26:13.560 --> 26:18.560]  mean have they ever been wrong and now the media is calling these women up but
[26:18.560 --> 26:22.560]  it's true and look Trump's hanging around he's had three wives he doesn't make
[26:22.560 --> 26:29.560]  excuses about it he's a family guy he likes kids I'm not saying he's perfect but
[26:29.560 --> 26:34.560]  Trump's come out and said I'm not behind this and he's not I remember stone five
[26:34.560 --> 26:39.560]  weeks ago here at dinner going yeah you know don't talk about it but those in a
[26:39.560 --> 26:43.560]  few months will be an inquire story I got called to confirm it and I said look
[26:43.560 --> 26:46.560]  I've heard about it but you know we're not gonna go with it because we're not
[26:46.560 --> 26:50.560]  gonna get into that type of stuff we're gonna go out to Cruz because he's a
[26:50.560 --> 26:53.560]  Bush operative and basically a sleeper cell and boy that and he's gonna be
[26:53.560 --> 27:01.560]  endorsed by Jeb Bush once Jeb drops out it'll all happen and so the issue here
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.560]  is Ted Cruz has everybody laying hands on him and he's being anointed by our new
[27:06.560 --> 27:17.560]  Lord and Savior the you know the Prophet Glenn Beck and so that's why he's got
[27:17.560 --> 27:21.560]  the problem is because he's up there saying he's the big evangelical he's the
[27:21.560 --> 27:26.560]  big Christian he judges people for their activities and their wildness and beauty
[27:26.560 --> 27:31.560]  pageants and Donald Trump's of the devil and then meanwhile you're got at least
[27:31.560 --> 27:35.560]  five mistresses in the word there's a whole bunch of others prostitutes you
[27:35.560 --> 27:41.560]  name it but let's just not forget that Roger Stone is a big Republican
[27:41.560 --> 27:46.560]  insider I mean he helped run with James Baker the big steal from Al Gore in
[27:46.560 --> 27:51.560]  Florida and he's apologized for it he was involved in all sorts of stuff back
[27:51.560 --> 27:56.560]  to dirty tricks with Nixon he writes books about admitting it now after 9-11
[27:56.560 --> 28:02.560]  after the Iraq invasion and all those lies he broke with him has written like
[28:02.560 --> 28:06.560]  eight books exposing the bushes and drug dealing and everything else that I
[28:06.560 --> 28:11.560]  already know that's why those stones you know has good intel because not many
[28:11.560 --> 28:14.560]  people done as much research as I have and interviewed all the experts and the
[28:14.560 --> 28:18.560]  CIA contractors and everybody else from me know Arkansas Stone knows his stuff
[28:18.560 --> 28:23.560]  and it's gone a few steps further we join us in the third hour today but that's
[28:23.560 --> 28:28.560]  a big deal I'm gonna be breaking that down but yes Cruz is lying he is lying
[28:28.560 --> 28:34.560]  Ted and boy let me tell you when the Bush family got behind him and then it
[28:34.560 --> 28:38.560]  goes back to him saying my ideological leader is George Herbert Walker Bush just
[28:38.560 --> 28:43.560]  six years ago that that's his mentor it's Rockefeller Republican and how are
[28:43.560 --> 28:47.560]  they gonna fool a tea party movement they're gonna put somebody in from DC
[28:47.560 --> 28:53.560]  get to get him a cowboy hat some lizard boots and I'm tough taxing boy yeah
[28:53.560 --> 28:59.560]  I'm here that New Yorker we don't much like New York value down here in Texas
[28:59.560 --> 29:07.560]  Ted Cruz brings new meaning to the term all hat no cattle that's coming from
[29:07.560 --> 29:12.560]  somebody that's all cattle and no hat alright Sanders super delegates may

[29:31.560 --> 29:36.560]  establishment stealing it from you you're a ringer you're a ringer alright I'm

[30:01.560 --> 30:04.560]  from this past weekend in today the Islamic State reportedly crucified a
[30:04.560 --> 30:08.560]  Catholic priest on Good Friday as part of its ongoing war against Christianity
[30:08.560 --> 30:11.560]  Father Tom who's an allele was kidnapped by ISIS gunman while they attacked the
[30:11.560 --> 30:15.560]  old people's home in southern Yemen killing at least 15 people on March 4th
[30:15.560 --> 30:18.560]  several religious groups had received threats that Father Thomas would be
[30:18.560 --> 30:22.560]  crucified on Good Friday but this was denied by his church in his hometown of
[30:22.560 --> 30:26.560]  Bangalore however the Archbishop of Vienna told a congregation gathered in
[30:26.560 --> 30:29.560]  St. Stephen's Cathedral in the Austrian capital that the priest had been
[30:29.560 --> 30:33.560]  crucified is not known how the Archbishop became aware of Father Thomas's
[30:33.560 --> 30:36.560]  alleged faith but his confirmation of the crucifixion was reported in the

[33:14.560 --> 33:39.560]  You are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[33:39.560 --> 33:56.560]  I'm going to get into communist oppression of religion and of free speech all over the world because it's clear that we're in a lot of trouble with the president last week saying there's little difference between communism and capitalism and we should merge the two systems
[33:56.560 --> 34:21.560]  That is the direct Carnegie endowment for peace plan 1935 declassified in 1972 online go read it and it is the general plan for complete and total disarmament and a quote piece for world 1962 State Department memorandum 7277
[34:21.560 --> 34:40.560]  Write these things down and you can actually pull up the scans of the manuals and how they're going to merge the global government and what's incredible is the Rockefeller's developers plan with the British Empire and even had articles in the New York Times in the 30s admitting the 10 regions of America
[34:40.560 --> 34:58.560]  Now there'd be 10 global regions but 10 sub regions and then three super regions that the 10 regions are within and then you read revelation and has that exact setup and you go wow did they get it from revelations or are they so cocky they don't even know they're fulfilling it
[34:58.560 --> 35:17.560]  All I know is wow we're living in a fantastic universe aren't we and so we sit up here and we try to warn people since the days of Barry Goldwater and the public can't understand it or figure it out
[35:17.560 --> 35:33.560]  Joseph McCarthy is one of the most reviled and demonized people ever but more than a decade ago the Russians released their files on their KGB and other spies in the United States and it turns out that it was worse than McCarthy said
[35:33.560 --> 35:49.560]  and it was exactly what he said that the Pentagon had had internal fights over it but from the highest levels through the foundations that are above government
[35:49.560 --> 36:04.560]  and from 1917 right through until the mid 50s our government and the British government was basically running the Bolshevik system
[36:04.560 --> 36:19.560]  and there was a big break up later and Stalin kind of went sideways on them after World War II and then there was some double dealing but by the mid 50s and by the time Stalin was gone and by the time the Trotskyites were driven out of Russia
[36:19.560 --> 36:40.560]  there were some operatives that had been sent in 1916, 1917, 100,000 out of New York to be the muscle because they spoke Russian. They were Slavic, Jews, others who were given the funds, the money as the special ops to go in and topple the czars
[36:40.560 --> 36:52.560]  and this is all in the historical record is what's crazy this is not my opinion what I'm telling you and then the Trotskyites got kicked out by Stalin and they came to the US and they got kicked out of here so they went to Mexico
[36:52.560 --> 37:00.560]  and Stalin sent assassins down there to kill Trotsky and others
[37:00.560 --> 37:11.560]  and then the real Cold War kicked in and so people get confused after that and go oh we had a stage split with the Soviet Union and oh it's all a secret plan still
[37:11.560 --> 37:21.560]  that's why so many of the folks that go back to the days of Cleon Skalsen who were right about it then still follow what he wrote in the 40s and 50s and think that's the template now, no it's not
[37:21.560 --> 37:43.560]  the Russians threw the first revolution group out and then actually took it over themselves but use the technologies of social engineering developed in the US and England that the Communists had been taught kept using their eugenics anti-family political correctness system
[37:43.560 --> 37:51.560]  they thought well it'll still work if we just kick these foreigners out and then we'll do it ourselves and then they did it and the whole country fell apart
[37:51.560 --> 38:01.560]  actually Russia got stronger for a while than it had been under the foreign Trotskyite rule but the point is that down the road it's still collapsed
[38:01.560 --> 38:12.560]  and Christianity stayed there and was underground but before I go into a whole history lesson this is ties into the jihadis
[38:12.560 --> 38:22.560]  this is a very sophisticated world and what the globalists do is they make different alliances and then as things change they will flip alliances and double cross
[38:22.560 --> 38:28.560]  trying to organize the chaos to bring in the world system they want
[38:28.560 --> 38:49.560]  and they use crises to play countries off against each other to impoverish nations to impoverish individuals to destroy religions that don't fit into their system to create a very secular drive to abolish diversity and freedom claiming that it's causing wars
[38:49.560 --> 39:04.560]  but there's a paradox out there that I see a lot on the internet and most people don't do this because they think it gets them points intellectually they do it because they really do see the paradox legitimately but aren't understanding what I'm saying
[39:04.560 --> 39:19.560]  so I'm going to be very deliberate about this and I'm going to explain this radical Islam since 1900 1901
[39:19.560 --> 39:39.560]  well hobbyist Islam has been funded by British intelligence and the British Empire to take over the Middle East and they set them up with their own royal house they gave them entrance to the Buckingham Palace they set them up as a legitimate royal family and put systems in of royal rule
[39:39.560 --> 40:04.560]  and that's why the Saudi house if you actually go online to their own website pledges allegiance to the Queen of England they were just Bedouin bandits who controlled key crossroads and by 1900 to 1932 in just 32 years
[40:04.560 --> 40:12.560]  they had conquered all Saudi Arabia that wasn't Saudi Arabia before scores of other countries Turkey you name it
[40:12.560 --> 40:23.560]  then Hitler comes in in World War two he kicks the British shot for a couple years out of North Africa the Middle East he comes in the Muslims pledge allegiance to him
[40:23.560 --> 40:40.560]  the hobbyist Sunnis and that whole thing rolls and at the end of World War two the keys go back to England but now the Rothschild say we want to set up Israel and they get a bunch of lobbying done in DC to now set up Israel as a satellite
[40:40.560 --> 40:57.560]  because the Rothschild had wanted to set up an area in southern Russia and Stalin wanted to do this for the Jews to have a homeland it was a deal they said okay you can go here but after that they said no we don't want that we want to have a place to go we want Israel after World War two
[40:57.560 --> 41:18.560]  so see to understand this you have to know the players and I can talk for 10 hours on this but let me just simplify I was against bombing Iraq because they didn't attack us and it was a secular country that was part of an Eisenhower pre policy that didn't come into fruition until 1979 long after he was out of office and dead
[41:18.560 --> 41:40.560]  to put a secular pro-west free market capitalist government in Iraq which wasn't Iraq before to merge three different groups together and to test it to see if Arabs could live in an industrial society it was a very wholesome good American thing that was done
[41:40.560 --> 42:01.560]  well that policy changed obviously and Saddam Hussein was shut up he was told to attack Iran he was told to go into Kuwait he was set up he was trained by the CIA and he was an army captain in 1958 in Cairo for two years he was a brave commando assassinated a bunch of communists did everything the CIA told him to do
[42:01.560 --> 42:11.560]  they had him they had a security for the bathas they said we won't overthrow you if you make him the head of security a decade later he's ordered to basically overthrow the government take over and assume command
[42:11.560 --> 42:26.560]  he was constantly battling al-qaeda type forces in Saudi Arabia they double crossing they set him up they bring him down and then they start killing millions more starving them they send our troops into a meat grinder and now they've turned the country over
[42:26.560 --> 42:37.560]  to the radical shiites and the radical Wahhabis to break the country up it's it's it's horrible and the deal for Saudi Arabia is they get part of Syria now
[42:37.560 --> 42:49.560]  to be able to launch their new caliphate takeover and then they can have the former CIA directors everybody on Fox News going Obama needs to crush them not just contain them and all this
[42:49.560 --> 42:59.560]  they open the door they gave them the weapons it's why they drive us armored vehicles and and Toyota trucks and have m16
[42:59.560 --> 43:07.560]  it doesn't mean we command them it means our criminal government the shadow government on record remember this is all come out
[43:07.560 --> 43:14.560]  armed them put them in when we figured out they were al-qaeda changed them to ISIS to confuse people
[43:14.560 --> 43:22.560]  and our own military had a soft coup against the coup group a counter coup in the last four years
[43:22.560 --> 43:31.560]  we told you this four years ago when no one else did because we have the sources that the Pentagon said we're not doing it and we're going to give the Russians intel
[43:31.560 --> 43:40.560]  and basically invite them in to stop you because you're a rogue government a rogue shadow group doing this and you did Benghazi and the rest of it we know your plan we're not going to back al-qaeda
[43:40.560 --> 43:48.560]  so Obama had the name changed to ISIS and all the rest of it to confuse people the military knows what's going on
[43:48.560 --> 43:58.560]  and so now people comment online and they talk about it everywhere saying Alex Jones has done a 180 in the last year
[43:58.560 --> 44:06.560]  he was saying all this terror was staged and was run by our government and now he's saying the terror threat's real and that we should fight these people
[44:06.560 --> 44:11.560]  that's not what I said so you can build straw men all day and say that I believe in Santa Claus I don't
[44:11.560 --> 44:17.560]  and then go Jones is a cookie believes in Santa Claus well that's not the case or Alex believes Obama sent a tornado to Oklahoma City
[44:17.560 --> 44:26.560]  never said that that's MSNBC just says that they just lie now if you want to be the type of person that's intellectually afraud and just makes up things
[44:26.560 --> 44:34.560]  don't make up that I'm a liar just make it up that you on the Taj Mahal say you're the emperor of the world be like a crazy schizophrenic that goes down before the city council
[44:34.560 --> 44:44.560]  every town's got them and says they're the king of the earth just make up whatever fantasy land you want because that's what the globalist offer you is 2 plus 2 equals 5
[44:44.560 --> 44:54.560]  so that said this is what's coming on Saudi Arabia is connected in with these shadowy groups that inherited the British Empire
[44:54.560 --> 45:04.560]  that runs the Anglo-American establishment they're allowing them to form groups they're bringing them in they're letting the millions of immigrants and migrants in
[45:04.560 --> 45:14.560]  who have huge groups of admitted sleeper cells it's in mainstream news Snowden came out and said he's seen the secret communiques that they knew full well
[45:14.560 --> 45:23.560]  that Greece and everybody warned them that there's huge sleeper cells coming in these are fighters 80% of them or more are military aged men
[45:23.560 --> 45:36.560]  well I can read that the newspaper not from Snowden it's been in the news ISIS said we're going to invade you with a migrant wave two years ago and it started
[45:36.560 --> 45:47.560]  I guess Snowden knows to say it's secret and everybody pays attention to him it's secret there's a son in the sky oh my gosh Snowden thank you how incredible
[45:47.560 --> 45:55.560]  so all of this is going on they're here they're going to be allowed to attack and then they're going to take our liberties and put TSA in the malls and on the streets
[45:55.560 --> 46:05.560]  and when they shoot down jet airliners like I said three years ago they're going to start taking our rights as well
[46:05.560 --> 46:23.560]  so this is what's happening and so it's a real threat 9-11 was synthetic terror Saudi Arabia was involved heavily criminal elements of our government were there was a stand down bear minimum that's been proven the 28 pages
[46:23.560 --> 46:39.560]  people say why don't you go further I went further on day one on 9-11 and said it's all fraud and exposed at all but now we have absolute proof like a string on a bad Christmas sweater you pull that string the whole thing unravels do you understand we have them
[46:39.560 --> 46:43.560]  we found the body in the basement
[46:43.560 --> 46:49.560]  now we've got the warrant to tear the whole house apart
[46:49.560 --> 47:01.560]  we found the dead body and guess what there's more bodies we don't know how many we have them we have them have them
[47:01.560 --> 47:11.560]  now these are interlocking criminal groups they're very very dangerous they're not going to give up power easily there is a global crime syndicate allied with radical Islam because it's in the middle of the crossroads of the world
[47:11.560 --> 47:31.560]  the Middle East has Asia and Central Asia and Southern Europe and Eastern Europe and all of it is connected and the Mediterranean and Africa and they've got their people everywhere they brought them into Syria to take over Syria and then have a bypass route directly into Turkey
[47:31.560 --> 47:45.560]  with trains conduiting right into Hungary and Romania and all the rest of those countries with Merkel saying come to mama you come here everything's free
[47:45.560 --> 48:05.560]  this is a planned out coordinated operation so just as I had posed the globalist attacking Iraq and other countries that weren't involved in 9-11 I'm opposing their plans now they're flooding us with people the most radical Muslims in the world that converge from all over the world to try to take over Syria and take over that industrial nation
[48:05.560 --> 48:25.560]  they come they kill your family they move into your house do you understand here they come and blow stuff up and then we're told you've got to watch how you speak you can't wear short dresses you've got to go apologize to the Muslims we've got to have sensitivity training so maybe they're nice and don't kill us
[48:25.560 --> 48:40.560]  and the ultimate false flag is I would estimate from the numbers we've seen in Europe 80% of military aged men they came from all over the world I've looked at it and I've analyzed the videos and I've looked at the intel and I've talked to sources
[48:40.560 --> 49:00.560]  more than half the refugees are actually sleeper cell operatives Europe now has millions of combatants in the country they're they're finding mosque full of weapons caches the police are told to keep it quiet they brought in hundreds of thousands conservatively it's not what Obama says into the US their military aged men as well
[49:00.560 --> 49:22.560]  this is it this is basically a trained commando armies who've had battle training and rape training and terror training who have been brought in who are just giving fake IDs giving new identities and just turn loose to get their orders
[49:22.560 --> 49:39.560]  and when they start striking this is just the beginning it is going to be horrible and this is the plan so of course I opposed going to Middle East to stir it up to bring down Iraq to open the corridors into Syria
[49:39.560 --> 50:00.560]  but we failed the globalist got their plans done so far now they're hitting us with the Jihad armies who are real and they will use them to take our liberties and our freedoms and undoubtedly target other non radical Muslim countries for overthrow after we're attacked again like 9 11
[50:00.560 --> 50:09.560]  this is the reality of what we're talking about
[50:09.560 --> 50:19.560]  I really don't even know what to say anymore at this point but what I'm gonna do right now is continue on
[50:19.560 --> 50:30.560]  skip this break and I'm going to cover just the latest news this is a small part of it because it would be the whole show if we did this
[50:30.560 --> 50:37.560]  of what the Jihadis are doing so let's just go over these headlines then I'm gonna tell these more in the next hour and take your calls
[50:37.560 --> 50:53.560]  Carson Obama administration crazy not to acknowledge Christians targeted in Pakistan oh no he'll say hey we're not just bringing Christians in we got to be fair and giggle about it and for 200 something Sunnis they bring in they'll bring in two
[50:53.560 --> 51:12.560]  Shiites and then one Christian tokenism suicide bomber kills 70 plus people now mostly women kids in Pakistan Park little Christian kids knowing for their little Easter celebration for Jesus getting blown up in that cute
[51:12.560 --> 51:32.560]  was 52 not 70 plus ISIS crucifies Catholic priest on Good Friday after kidnapping him from an old people's home man what men where four nuns were shot dead that's in Yemen
[51:32.560 --> 51:48.560]  German train operator introduces women only carriages and fears over migrant sex attacks yeah women won't get on the trains now it's so horrible they rape them right in front everybody Brussels bomber was migrant rights activists who lived next door to the EU a
[51:48.560 --> 52:09.560]  migrant right activist the bomber because that's part of the plan bring the people in bring in the sleeper cells they'll work all the dumb leftist I mean literally these guys go up to liberal women in schools and just say prove you're not racist have sex with me and they do I mean this is on record because it's
[52:09.560 --> 52:26.560]  it's hating your country hating your culture is the sacrament and the religion of these people and feminists don't want a man that treats them well is good to them they want to get their jaws broken their teeth knocked out I'm serious I mean they love it they hate their
[52:26.560 --> 52:46.560]  fathers because they were good to them this is sick demonic stuff folks here's another one reveal how UK AIDS terrorist after yet more budget cuts another 12 billion of your taxes are being splurged on foreign handouts for militants killers
[52:46.560 --> 53:03.560]  Pakistan palaces and jobs that don't exist yeah I'm gonna say it again criminal elements of our government and corporations are funding radical Islam and turning it loose and people go well then why are you for stopping it if it's controlled yes I want the criminals out of our
[53:03.560 --> 53:22.560]  government that are doing it I'm exposing the program I'm exposing the plan and people keep two ideas in their head at the same time we're fighting stirring it up we're fighting the Shiite Sunni Civil War we're fighting the globalist giving ISIS and Al Qaeda the money which
[53:22.560 --> 53:40.560]  ISIS come in and kick them out and then we're also opposing phase three of this where they bring them into our country in mash and then everything goes to hell in a handbasket whenever the globalist through their operatives at the top of ISIS and Al Qaeda give
[53:40.560 --> 53:55.560]  them the orders to carry out the attacks and here's another deal these people double cross each other these caliphate folks out of Saudi Arabia that Saudi Arabia's muscle in our government our country remember Russia was going to Syria last year they said we're
[53:55.560 --> 54:12.560]  gonna bomb your Olympics if you don't stop they had their ambassador come out and say it they have given a couple thousand men who were vicious desert bandits the British intelligence chose to control the whole region because they were right in the middle
[54:12.560 --> 54:29.560]  and they were fearless and vicious the best fighters for the Arabs horrible slavers their slavers sex slavers ladies and gentlemen that killed kill the man and take the women and children from the caravans sex slavers have hundreds of trillions of
[54:29.560 --> 54:51.560]  dollars and have bought off Hollywood and have merged with the elite of Europe and it is just the sickest filthiest thing you could ever imagine and then and all these other CD corrupt groups and it's just so horrible and this is the detonator they're
[54:51.560 --> 55:06.560]  sitting on our heart with millions of radical Muslims in the country ready to follow their sleeper cell operations to go in and be leftist be social justice warriors to call for restrictions of speech to call for by to accept what they want and bow to them
[55:06.560 --> 55:24.560]  and then they got their soldiers that are their pride in their mosque who are ready to be activated at any time and if the FBI does its job it comes in and tries to stop them in San Bernardino they're told stand down and this is what's going on this is not my opinion this is a fact
[55:24.560 --> 55:37.560]  video angry Muslims start screaming Palestine in middle of Brussels Memorial for terror victims we have that video I'm going to play that here in just a moment and you know people say well Palestine's being abused bad things have happened yeah I get that the point is though it's not the whole thing in the
[55:37.560 --> 55:53.560]  world these are liberal people in Belgium who got bombed and killed and they have nothing to do with that and so it's okay for them to have a memorial without the Palestinians showing up and saying it's all about me it's the only thing in the world
[55:53.560 --> 56:06.560]  you never hear about the million and a half Iraqis killed with all this evil take on their country over because that's not the liberal cost left it's all the thousands of Palestinians well I care about them too but I don't just care about something when I'm ordered to
[56:06.560 --> 56:24.560]  yeah let's go ahead and play the video we can let's back it up and this guy just gets up and starts yelling Palestine people can argue well he's not celebrating the death of these people the point is he's got a lot of nerve get up you know here people just blown up an American Airlines line yeah here's their families and people to
[56:24.560 --> 56:43.560]  come to my memorial and here's this arrogant guy because the media and the colleges all tell him he's the poor little baby he's the best thing yeah let's back it up where he's actually out there yelling because let me tell you something you come to my
[56:43.560 --> 56:56.560]  family you're doing that I'm not putting up with your crap people have free speech they don't have the free speech to go in the middle of somebody's event and sit there and do that it's disgusting
[56:56.560 --> 57:24.560]  he's got like three jobs on the side arrogance that can't handle anymore and the hatred it's a cultural racism against the West these people are like they have the same seething hate I've seen in
[57:24.560 --> 57:35.560]  top clan members in fact it's even worse they just and see the thing is they feel inadequate they don't feel as good as they see Madison Avenue and the Hollywood culture and the glitz and the class envy
[57:35.560 --> 57:49.560]  I don't care they're liberal white guy liberal Arab guy a woman whatever it is they just hate everyone and what they were is their cloak of power is their liberalism and everything else but then they're not liberal they're pouring acid on people's faces

[1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:03.200]  acknowledge Christians targeting Pakistan. Yeah, Obama the last few Easter's badmouth
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:07.360]  Christianity. I'll be honest, I just took off yesterday. I didn't really do any work.
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:11.800]  I'll shut an hour long Facebook mentions from my parents, hot tub. But other than that, I
[1:09:11.800 --> 1:09:16.720]  took the day off. I bet he put some snotty comment out about Christians need to be tolerant
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.640]  or something. He always does. But he's done it in the past. Suicide bomber, again, blows
[1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:28.320]  up mostly women and children. And then you go through this, the Catholic priests crucified.
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:33.640]  They got him out of an old folks home, crucified him and then shot the four nuns. German train
[1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:39.880]  operator introduces women-only carriages amid fears over migrant sex attacks. Brussels
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:45.240]  bomber was a migrant rights activist who lived next door to EU. No, he was a recruiter for
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:50.040]  ISIS cells to get in and he did a great job.
[1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:53.600]  ISIS over a year ago told us we're going to put in hundreds of thousands of our operatives
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:57.080]  in the migrant wave. We're going to launch the migrant wave. And Myrtle said, the door's
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:05.360]  open. Come to mommy. Come to the commie. Revealed how UK aged terrorists daily mail how the
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:08.920]  government's funding the Jihad groups. Yes, our criminal governments are funding. People
[1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:12.920]  go, well, then if we're funding it, we shouldn't be for attacking them. The criminals in our
[1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:16.720]  government are bringing them in to attacks. They can set a police state up. I'm against
[1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:23.320]  the criminals in our government and against their operatives. Figure that out yet.
[1:10:23.320 --> 1:10:27.240]  Video angry Muslims start screaming Palestine in the middle of Brussels Memorial terror
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:32.360]  victims. And I love this part. Pope denounces USA Today. Pope denounces terrorism in Easter
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:39.080]  mass amid tight Vatican security. Yeah, they've got these hundred and 200 foot walls, security
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:44.440]  everywhere. They have this open square. People can come into amidst the walls. And this is
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:50.360]  a guy that has all the security, but he wants Europe to be open to the quote migrants because
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:11:01.440]  it's part of the larger plan. Syrian army retakes Palmyra from ISIS. Obama reiterates
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:09.560]  refugee promise to bring more in. So that's just some of the news on that front. And then
[1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:16.080]  after I go to some of your calls, Clinton email probe enters new phase as FBI interview
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:20.960]  looms. Trump and Ryan can be for control of the GOP. Roger Stones joining us. He'll have
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:24.520]  the really big news on Wednesday. He has big news today. He's not ready to launch it until
[1:11:24.520 --> 1:11:29.240]  Wednesday now. But he said he still wants to come on today. He I call him to come on
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:32.280]  all the time. He goes, I'm going to come on. I got something really big. And so now he's
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:36.160]  ready to come on twice this week. He didn't want to come on last week. Paul Ryan faces
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:40.440]  primary challenge from wealthy businessman betrayed by House Speaker. And then here's
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:47.720]  the big Roger Stone news up on info wars.com. Walker will endorse Cruz in Wisconsin push.
[1:11:47.720 --> 1:11:53.240]  The big steel is on. And the really big news will be an exclusive article we get from him
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:57.280]  on Wednesday. We need to get this article out on Facebook, Twitter and everywhere else.
[1:11:57.280 --> 1:12:02.720]  So that's just some of what's coming up. And then I've got communist oppressing free speech.
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:07.280]  You know, they arrest and torture and kill and take the organs of Tibetan monks. They've
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:12.280]  disappeared hundreds of thousands of Tibetans conservatively. They, you know, rocket attack
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:17.040]  and blow up their monasteries. But don't worry, China official says Dalai Lama making a fool
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:21.800]  of Buddhism. You just kill any Buddhist. You get your hands on peaceful, nice people. It
[1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:29.400]  doesn't really a religion. You it's a religion slash philosophy. You kill them. And then
[1:12:29.400 --> 1:12:34.640]  you say he's making a mockery out of it. I just want to point out how communism works
[1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:39.120]  right under this article. How a Venezuelan opposition leader secretly communicates with
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:43.800]  solidary confinement for two years because he was leading in the major election numbers.
[1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:48.400]  So they just arrested him two years. That's communism. Oh, but member Hugo Chavez said
[1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:55.000]  he wasn't a communist. And later he went, of course, we were communist Bernie Sanders.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:13:02.560]  I'm not a communist. They tell you what to eat, what to wear, when to sleep. You want
[1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:14.880]  to be a sheep? You are communist. I want my rights just like Jimmy Carter says quote
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:22.920]  Scarface. But now these new migrants, most of them, they're not coming here to get away
[1:13:22.920 --> 1:13:27.520]  from the socialism. They hear there's more socialism up here and a better, a better deal.
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:32.680]  I mean, we are in so much trouble. And I'm not just trying to be negative here. We are
[1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:37.320]  screwed, blew and tattooed. If we don't wake up immediately and have a total shift against
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:43.760]  all this. And here's the big $64 trillion statement on Trump, the big secret on Trump.
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:50.080]  Donald Trump doesn't matter whether he's good, bad or indifferent. I tend to say good. He's
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:53.920]  capturing the history, the moment, the time he was battling NAFTA and GATT 20 something
[1:13:53.920 --> 1:14:01.120]  years ago. He's not perfect. But it doesn't matter. He's forcing every magazine, every
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:06.240]  publication, every leader, world leaders, communist leaders, foreign governments, the
[1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:11.240]  Pope to come out and say he's a horrible man. He's Hitler. He's evil. You can't have him.
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:16.360]  And by the way, it was on Fox and CNN this morning when I was exercising. I know you're
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:26.880]  seeing it. They are main lining, stealing the election from him. They are main lining.
[1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:30.600]  Just saying, Hey, we're going to take it from him. We don't care. If he gets all the delegates,
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:35.880]  half the delegates, whatever. Paul Ryan's waiting in the wings. We've got Mitt Romney.
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:38.360]  Just waiting. We're just going to go ahead and just give it to someone who didn't have
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:43.840]  one vote. And your vote doesn't count. Nakedly admitting it out in the open. This is a huge
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:49.400]  time, folks. The elite can't help themselves with the steal things. But in this, it's the
[1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:54.560]  end. You think America is awake now? They're stealing it from Bernie Sanders. They're stealing
[1:14:54.560 --> 1:15:00.040]  it from Donald Trump. They're announcing it's okay. Having all the channels say it's okay
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:03.240]  from the Washington Post, the time magazine. Thank God the Republicans are doing the right
[1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:07.280]  thing and getting ready to not let him have the nomination. That's totally reasonable.
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:13.760]  They can do that if they want. Jeffrey Dahmer can grab your teenage son off the street if
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:18.880]  he wants. I mean, we could just, we just changed the rule. We're God with these elections and
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:23.360]  taxpayer money spent on them and holding out that your vote counts and all the rest of
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:26.960]  it and saying, Oh, actually we have a rule. We don't have to do that. It's total fraud,
[1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:32.560]  false advertising, racketeering. But they just say, Oh no, we're allowed to. No, you're
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:37.400]  not. Just like you're not allowed to go. Have some secret TPP that takes control of our country
[1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:41.760]  and everything 50 times worse than after a get and just tell us, Hey, just shut up.
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:47.520]  We know what we're doing. Everything is about these crooks hiding in plain view and then
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:51.360]  having the universities and media brainwash and go, how dare these right wingers all turn
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:56.160]  their guns in and they like Donald Trump and how dare them want a border. It's just terrible.
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:59.360]  We're going to go along. We want our free stuff now. You're not going to get me free
[1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:03.600]  stuff. You morons. That's all about to dry up. And I'm talking to the liberals out there.
[1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:09.520]  You're not liberals. I'm going to a more and Stacy and Terry and Jack and Jeremy here in just a
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:17.600]  moment. But first off, secret 12 is the most powerful concentrated methylcobalamin 80%.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:23.920]  The others, the other T key basis of item B12 that fuses with it and helps be more
[1:16:23.920 --> 1:16:29.440]  absorbable. Go read about the science, the info at m4slife.com takes it sublingual. This is the
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:35.040]  most absorbable out there outside of injections. And by the way, it's, it's, it's like medical
[1:16:35.040 --> 1:16:38.880]  grade. Don't inject it though, folks. The point is, is that this is the same stuff when I went
[1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:43.280]  and got a prescription for it a few years ago. I mean, it's the same stuff, the same taste,
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:47.760]  the same color, the same pure thing, methylcobalamin. I mean, it is amazing.
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:54.800]  It varies. Most people can only sort 5 or 10% of item B12 and it's synthetic, really none of it.
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:57.840]  This is organic under the tongue. It goes into the bloodstream. You got to hold it there for
[1:16:57.840 --> 1:17:03.040]  about a minute. You get huge absorption. We were not allowed to say because of all the, you know,
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:07.200]  the way things work out there, but go look it up yourself, infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:13.520]  And finally, survival field X2 and infowarslife.com, the exclusive pure nascent iodine formula that
[1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:17.440]  no one else has. Well, three years ago, I first told you about the power of super high quality
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:21.760]  nascent iodine and the iodine conspiracy. We've talked about how iodine was taken out of the food
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:26.960]  supply and how populations gained as much as 15 IQ points when it was added back into the salt.
[1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:31.520]  Now, the newest iodine discovery is being revealed, how iodine works with the gut to
[1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:36.320]  promote optimum health. The research is clear, iodine is key and is essential to support thyroid
[1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:41.120]  help that then controls the stomach, the gut. Survival shield X2 nascent iodine is extracted
[1:17:41.120 --> 1:17:47.600]  from 200 million year old deep earth crystals from seven to 12,000 feet. Visit infowarslife.com
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:53.120]  and secure your bottle of survival shield X2 nascent iodine today to experience the true power
[1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:57.840]  of nascent iodine. Let's jam in one call before we go to break. Let's talk to
[1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:05.120]  more in Texas here on the air. Thank you for calling. Good morning, Mr. Jones. I was gonna say,
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:11.520]  I think that they're using radical, radical Islam as their little army, but I wouldn't term it
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:17.760]  radical Islam. I would resort or term it Arab terrorism. And the reason is Arab terrorism,
[1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:23.200]  because if we go to the early origins of Islam, Arabs was actually outsiders in the Karan says
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:29.520]  that itself, the founders of Islam were more than Saracens, but they went by the Umma,
[1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:34.320]  and it was a Umayyad and they went to war with Arabs and the Karan says that the Arabs
[1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:40.160]  are outside groups and they don't even know the laws which Allah brought. So they use Islam,
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:44.320]  but they're actually foreigners to Islam and it's it's throughout the Karan.
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:50.800]  And a true Imam would actually know that Arabs wasn't even in a group that was that the Karan
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:54.400]  was revealed to. Well, it is true. I mean, I actually that's in the history. You're absolutely
[1:18:54.400 --> 1:18:59.680]  right. And there's been a golden age of Islam. Lord Moncton talks about where it was helping the
[1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:05.200]  entire world. And then it fell back into this, but Saudi Arabia, the people running that are the
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:09.920]  ones radicalizing it. They're the ones using it to take over the world. They are the ones
[1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:13.360]  that are going to end up getting Muslims across the world killed.
[1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:20.640]  Yes, sir. And I wish it was the way I can give you this Karanic verse. I was trying to look
[1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:24.160]  forward while I was on break, but it actually says that they are ignorant to the laws.
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:30.400]  You know, I don't know. It just paints a bad picture of Arabs. But well, I know this. There's
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:37.760]  no Christians or Jews getting bombed in Iran. And historically, the Shiites do not blow up
[1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:42.960]  Christians and Jews and other people unless they've attacked them. And the Saudi Arabians
[1:19:43.760 --> 1:19:47.760]  will cut your head off the second time you get caught preaching the gospel in Saudi Arabia.
[1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:51.760]  And we're supposed to open the door to these people. And by the way, a lot of Saudi Arabians
[1:19:51.760 --> 1:19:55.600]  hate their government, too. I mean, they treat women like slaves, folks. It's out of control.
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:57.760]  We'll be back with more calls. Stay with us. Thank you more.

Your body's primary metabolic function is to make protein. One World Way is a unique, non-denatured protein. This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer no more than 18%

[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:45.280]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing for me. I'm 36 years old and for the past several years, I've been struggling with lack of energy, dryness and stamina. And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy. My yoga practice has deepened and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:50.320]  than I've been able to in here. I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.
[1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:42.320]  The final phase of extermination is set to commence now. And as population die-off becomes evident, you know it is the time of punishment in all that is written. The cover for mass die-off is evolution and global warming frauds, also used as false proof of their Christ.
[1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:57.360]  They are from the lines that were disinherited 2,000 years ago. Now they claim to be his Christ based upon blood type, DNA and long life span. Go to unveilingthem.com. That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com.
[1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:39.280]  And the people that do get hurt the worst by Saudi Arabia's activities are other Muslims around the world who in their history have just slowly been exterminated and driven out. There have been so many Muslim communities where they're the majority and they're nice to Christians and nice to everybody else and those people get blown up by the radicals who are just expansionists and want to run everybody's lives. It's a cult.
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:50.480]  There's a radical Islam cult taking over. And it's allied with criminal elements in the West to carve up the world and use them as a threat to then be able to basically take our basic freedoms.
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:55.440]  Stacy in Colorado, thanks for calling. You're on the air worldwide.
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:25:09.440]  Yes, I was just calling to tell you that I completely agree with you on what happened in Iraq. They should have never sent anybody over there. They didn't do anything to us. Why start something that didn't need to be started in the first place?
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:27.440]  Al Qaeda was less than 2,000 operatives in 2001 than it was supposedly defeated by 2012 or so. And now we're told there's hundreds of thousands of ISIS in the Middle East, millions of quote migrants, large portions of the military aged men that pledge allegiance to radical Wahhabi Islam.
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:43.440]  Our governments advertised, opened the corridors, made the deal with Turkey in the EU and have flooded us by design. This is organized treason, an organized destabilization campaign, period. What do you say to that?
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:26:05.440]  Well, I mean, okay, this is what gets me the most on this, is the biggest thing is trying to control women and what they say and what they do and how they do things. You come up to me and you try to tell me that you're going to die trying to tell me that and taking me down in the process. I am not going to do it.
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:17.440]  Oh, absolutely. There's no way the free West is anywhere compatible with Islam. And they'll have to bring in a tyranny less than Islam to protect us from Islam. That's the plan. This is how we're being muscled, Stacy. God bless you.
[1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:24.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to Terry in Minnesota. You're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:35.440]  Hey, man of God, heavy emphasis on man. You're my brother in Christ. I talked to you last week and gave you that little tidbit on the Jeremiah thing about God causes children stupid. Don't remember that or not?
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:36.440]  Yes.
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:58.440]  Anyway, this is for Joe Biggs, too, especially, and I hope he's doing okay. There is a church. It's almost in your backyard. They're the largest non-denominational church basically in the world. They're like the Info Wars of churches. They don't get their money from passing plates. They get it from their teaching of the word basically and their stuff.
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:20.440]  I'm getting to that. Okay. In the 13th chapter on the 18th verse of Revelation, dealing with faith, the note in this book that this church uses, which was out of print and these people brought it back, I'm going to read the note on ISIS and this is exactly verbatim.
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:34.440]  Okay, here it goes. The three letters SSS in parentheses equals 666 form the symbol of ISIS and the secret symbol of the old mystery is the ancient mysteries and modern beliefs are becoming closely aligned.
[1:27:34.440 --> 1:27:40.440]  Witness and rapid growth and spread of spiritism. I can't say that right. You know, cultism of every kind.
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:56.440]  Yeah, let me expand on that. No, no, I mean, it's true that ISIS picks this occultic goddess name. Why would a quote Islamic group do that? And absolutely, that was branded by the globalist who don't totally control it, but are financing it and protecting it, gave birth to it basically.
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:28:04.440]  And now it's running around like a monster. But are you saying that this was in a Bible study book published before ISIS existed?
[1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:16.440]  What I'm saying is this is a standard King James. It was out of print. The senior pastor of this church brought it back out of print from Craig of Publications. It's called the companion Bible.
[1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:18.440]  This church has been using it for 60 years.
[1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:24.440]  Sure, I know about the companion Bible. So why don't you again, just tell us the church.
[1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:34.440]  It's the shepherd's chapel dot com. And this is why I wanted to tell big because the head of this pastor was in the worst battle of the Korean war. He was a Marine Corps sergeant.
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:39.440]  He's from Oklahoma and this church is then you're in your back areas and grab it Arkansas. Alex.
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:44.440]  That's not my backyard, bro. That's about 10 hours away. But listen, I appreciate your call. Thank you so much.
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:52.440]  Specifically, I wanted to know what you thought about radicalism and where it's going and the class of civilizations. I'm not mad. It's just we go on these rabbit trails.
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:56.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jack in New York. Jack, go ahead. You got one minute.
[1:28:56.440 --> 1:29:11.440]  Hi, Alex. Long time listener listening for about 16 years. I see the the religion of Islam is being taken captive in the same way that we've been taken captive by the new world order.
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:36.440]  And you have Saudi Arabia in in kind with the new world order and they're using the migrant situation as a way to bring in radical jihadist army to put pressure on the American people and then in conjunction with
[1:29:36.440 --> 1:29:44.440]  I want you to finish up. Come back. I want you to finish up and get some really important medical news as well coming up. Stay with us. Don't hang up, Jack.
[1:29:44.440 --> 1:29:47.440]  Other callers will get to you as well.
[1:29:47.440 --> 1:29:58.440]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:08.440]  Today is Monday, March 28th, and here are some of the top stories from this past weekend and today. The Islamic State reportedly crucified a Catholic priest on Good Friday as part of its ongoing war against Christianity.
[1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:15.440]  Father Tom Hoonsaraliel was kidnapped by ISIS gunmen while they attacked an old people's home in southern Yemen, killing at least 15 people on March 4th.
[1:30:15.440 --> 1:30:22.440]  Several religious groups had received threats that Father Thomas would be crucified on Good Friday, but this was denied by his church in his hometown of Bangalore.
[1:30:22.440 --> 1:30:30.440]  However, the Archbishop of Vienna told a congregation gathered in St. Stephen's Cathedral in the Austrian capital that the priest had been crucified.
[1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:37.440]  It is not known how the Archbishop became aware of Father Thomas's alleged faith, but his confirmation of the crucifixion was reported in the Austrian media.
[1:30:37.440 --> 1:30:39.440]  Other details have not yet emerged.
[1:30:39.440 --> 1:30:47.440]  In other news, Japan's space agency has lost contact with the Steve Space Satellite equipped with X-ray telescopes designed to study the secrets of space.
[1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:54.440]  The satellite is surrounded by five pieces of debris, which could be its own parts, and it's been bearing off course since Saturday as reported by RT.

[1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:29.440]  I'm a nine-year listener by all the nutraceuticals, COFX, NACES, and I-
[1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:31.440]  Why? God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:34.440]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:35.440]  What products are you taking?
[1:31:35.440 --> 1:31:47.440]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to Winterson, X2, even got a little DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[1:31:58.440 --> 1:32:04.440]  More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[1:32:04.440 --> 1:32:10.440]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ,
[1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:17.440]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[1:32:17.440 --> 1:32:24.440]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in, and when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:27.440]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[1:32:27.440 --> 1:32:35.440]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[1:32:35.440 --> 1:32:40.440]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:42.440]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[1:32:42.440 --> 1:32:49.440]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:33:18.440]  Please stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[1:33:18.440 --> 1:33:25.440]  All right, Roger Stone joins us at about 7-8 after next hour with big Trump news across the board.
[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:29.440]  He has the biggest news yet. He wanted to be able to launch today.
[1:33:29.440 --> 1:33:38.440]  He's going to launch it Wednesday with us as well, but Walker is about to endorse in Wisconsin.
[1:33:38.440 --> 1:33:45.440]  Lion Ted, we're going to be looking at that and a lot more and taking your phone calls coming up with Roger Stone in the next hour.
[1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:48.440]  Then it comes back Wednesday with the big news, and I know what it is.
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:54.440]  We still got to get it codified and ready to announce it because it will be newsmaking about what's going on.
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:59.440]  But we'll be focusing in on the election coming up in the third hour today.
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:03.440]  Then the fourth hour, Paul Joseph Watson will host. We've expanded the show.
[1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:06.440]  A lot of times I co-host as well. A lot of special reports, you name it.
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:10.440]  Paul Joseph Watson from London will be hosting, always hard-hitting, the fourth hour.
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:17.440]  Then M4's Valley News. Tonight's 7 o'clock Central Standard Time with our great crew anchoring and running all of that as well.
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:26.440]  David Knight's out covering Trump rallies we've sent due and others up to Wisconsin and Chicago to follow Bernie Sanders, Hillary and Trump.
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:35.440]  That's going to be big. So all of that coming up, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the week as we kick off this Monday Worldwide Transmission.
[1:34:35.440 --> 1:34:40.440]  We're already halfway to the broadcast, but as we kick off the continuation of the week here.
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:44.440]  Now, we have a special guest popping in until the end of the hour. Then I'll go back to your calls as well.
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:34:50.440]  I want to jack in New York to be able to finish up here because he was really laying out. He's the actual caller that called in.
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:54.440]  The other callers are great. They're kind of all over the map, but it's been interesting and informative.
[1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:59.440]  I want to hear from you. Do you think I'm wrong about what I'm saying about radicalism?
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:09.440]  I mean, or I know I'm not wrong. I'm saying, does it make sense to you that there's criminal elements letting them in so they can attack us and then take our liberties?
[1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:15.440]  And then we can also move troops in the Middle East and attack countries that aren't part of radicalism like Saudi Arabia attacks us on 9 11.
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:22.440]  So we attack Iraq. Our governments are bringing them in. They're not checking them on purpose. Governors have told us this.
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:29.440]  The FBI admits this. This is a fact and it's such a bold move. So we'll continue that discussion also on into the fourth hour as well.
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:33.440]  We have a very special guest popping in for about 20, 30 minutes here in just a moment.
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:37.440]  Going back to Jack in New York, go ahead and recap what you said and finish up, sir.
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:59.440]  OK, what I said was that they're using radical Islam in the migrant movement as a pincer movement together with the open borders in the south to bring Balkanization and riotous situations in America
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:07.440]  so they can clamp down in this end game to take down America. I mean, our economy's already in the toilet.
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:19.440]  You know, their jobs situation is worse than I've ever seen it. I'm 62 years old and so basically it's an army.
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:29.440]  Let's call it what it is. They call them migrants, but these are not migrants. These are all military age young men.
[1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:37.440]  They're coming and they're going to bring the same kind of destruction that they brought all over Europe. They're going to bring it here as well.
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:41.440]  And this is part of the NWO's end game.
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:49.440]  That's right. And they've been raised by a cult. They kill each other constantly. It is just insanity.
[1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:59.440]  And it's because Islam's been taken over by the desert bandit, slave, white slave, sex traffic ring that is the Saudi royal family and that's who they were.
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:07.440]  They robbed caravans and they've taken over. They took over Medina. They took over Mecca. They run the whole show now and God help us.
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:14.440]  I mean, this is just, we are in so much trouble and the Muslims are in trouble. I mean, it just gets more oppressive, more authoritarian by the minutes.
[1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:21.440]  That's why I say it is radical Islam because Islam had its own problems. Christianity's had its problems, you know, with bad forms of it being oppressive.
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:26.440]  This is out of control. I mean, this is out of control. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[1:37:26.440 --> 1:37:33.440]  But what he said is key. This is an end game, folks. Everything we see coming together in the next few years, this is end game stuff.
[1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:49.440]  I mean, the elite are pulling the stops out now. I'm glad I was able to get him today because I listen when I'm on the stair stepper or the elliptical to dead doctors don't lie that syndicated out of some of the affiliates in California that
[1:37:49.440 --> 1:38:03.440]  Michael's whirling owns. And I remember listening on cassette tapes, the dead doctors don't lie 20 years ago. And just everything that I heard there, everything ended up coming out in mainstream science later. I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:19.440]  I remember Dr. Wallach 20 years ago, before he even, you know, started young shabbat 1617 years ago, talking about how statin drugs eat your brain. And I remember my dad talking about it. And he's a chemist and oral surgeon retired smart guy.
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:29.440]  He was reading medical literature. But I only heard my dad say it and Wallach said it. And nowadays you type it in. It's all over mainstream news. Are statins linked to brain death? Are they blah, blah, blah.
[1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:44.440]  So I was just listening this weekend. And I was supposed to even call on the show. They wanted me as a guest. But I just said, I can't do it. But I still have tuned in online.
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:51.440]  Because I wanted to hear it. Sometimes you don't want to be on air yourself. You want to listen to somebody else. The more I'm on air, the less I want to be on. I like to watch somebody else.
[1:38:51.440 --> 1:39:03.440]  And I just heard him lay out in like 10 minutes what statins do to you. And then I went and did the research years ago that Dr. Wallach and Dr. Wallach, but like Dr. Blalock, who's a retired top brain surgeon on, you know, saying the same thing now as well.
[1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:15.440]  It's just amazing that they're doing this to us. So this is something I can counter glyphosates, fluoride in the water. That's starting to get taken out. We can target the statins. I mean, I know so many people who are totally together.
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:26.440]  55, they tell them, you might be at risk for stroke, take these, or you might be at risk for, you know, high blood pressure, take these or cholesterol, take these. And these people in a couple of years are gone.
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:37.440]  I know someone well whose dad was like 55, went on these, is 60 now. He can't write anymore. He's like a five year old.
[1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:47.440]  They're like, is it early onset of dementia? No, his brain is being eaten. So we're not just being negative here. This is something you can do. So I thought, let's get Wallach on.
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:55.440]  Then I found out he's having a big event that I'm not connected to or involved just promoting because I love it. A couple big events coming up. I know George Norris and promoting him as well.
[1:39:55.440 --> 1:40:12.440]  That are so exciting for people to learn about this. He's trying to push a revolution against this and he's sued the, what is it, FDA seven times in one every time. Wallach's the plaintiff and folks that actually got in the 90s and other times,
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:29.440]  laws passed to block them outlawing supplements. So everybody ought to be thinking Dr. Wallach, m4worsteam.com is obviously where you can sign up and get free shipping when you do auto ship or sign up to be distributor and get big discounts, 30% off your first time you order m4worshealth.com is again the same as m4worsteam.com.
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:43.440]  Wallachonline.com is his site and he's putting on some big events. And so I'll do a plug for young Jevity because we have our own nutraceuticals, but we have like 15 of them. They have hundreds and they're all the highest quality, highest standards, whether it's the beyond 10 years and
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:58.440]  if it's the engineering 2.0 or pollen burst or the osteo effects, these are amazing products. And when you purchase them at m4worshealth.com or m4worslife.com, you also help finance this operation. It's a small amount of what comes in as a profit goes to us to be able to fund this operation.
[1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:17.440]  And you know, most revolutionaries rob banks and kidnap people to get money. We we sell high quality products and Hillary for present t shirts and non GMO heirloom sees the lowest prices and just all sorts of really cool stuff at m4worsstore.com m4worslife.com. That's our products, but m4worshealth.com m4worsteam.com is the full line discounted highest quality
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:44.440]  young Jevity products. So m4worshealth.com or m4worsteam.com to find that. But getting to Dr. Wallach now. He'll do this till five after next hour. I know he's busy on the road. We've been trying to get him and he's able to come on today. So thank you Dr. Wallach for joining us. I want to get you back in the near future for a full hour via Skype or back in studio again. It was amazing. The two times you visited us here in studio. But man, just the way you were breaking it down.
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:59.440]  I mean, I should get in your background. He's published numerous books on dietary deficiencies, conducts approximately 300 lectures annually, sold over 40 million copies of the lecture dead doctors online, born and raised in Missouri, walk into the University of Missouri and receive his bachelor's degree in science of agriculture.
[1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:13.440]  And then of course he became a veterinarian for 30 years and then he got other medical degrees. But he just kept learning, trying to keep animals alive and huge animal research facility zoos is famous zoological guy that it was deficiencies that was killing most of them and causing all sorts of degenerative diseases.
[1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:24.440]  Well, no kidding. That's what they're saying. Scurvy's making a comeback across the West. The BBC reported people aren't getting vitamin C or their guts are so unhealthy from gluten, they're not absorbing it.
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:33.440]  That came out the New York Times last week. Oh, top scientists, you're getting most cancer because your guts dead. Oh, they came out. I mean, just admitting everything that he pioneered.
[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:45.440]  I'm not kissing his butt. This guy was pioneering this 30 years ago. I learned about him 20 years ago. So enough of that. Dr. Wallach, great to have you back with us. Let's just focus in on the statin conspiracy today, sir.
[1:42:45.440 --> 1:42:51.440]  Okay, well, thank you so much, Alex. It's always good to be with you and look forward to getting back to Austin.
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:43:12.440]  But just the thing on the statin drug that actually started in 1901, when the German Navy went to a guy named Wilhelm Norman, who's a chemist in Berlin, and they went to him and said, look, we need a smokeless, synthetic lubricant for German submarine diesel engines.
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:22.440]  And by 1904, he'd accomplished that. And Michelin story shard after the First World War was over, they didn't need him anymore. So they sold that to patent to a British soap manufacturing company.
[1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:31.440]  They made soap out of it, and they couldn't sell it because everybody's making their own soap. So in the 1940s, they sold it to Procter and Gamble in the United States, and they couldn't sell the soap either.
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:48.440]  So they decided to use it as a cooking sharpening. They were having trouble selling it in a can because a grandma liked her lard and cream and butter and eggs and have been generations of people's families using lard and butter and cream and eggs for cooking, and nobody really got into this product.
[1:43:48.440 --> 1:44:03.440]  Well, there's a guy by the name of Ansel Keys, who's a medical doctor on the staff of the medical school in Minnesota and Minneapolis, and he was on the board of Procter and Gamble. He was also on the board of the American Heart Association.
[1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:24.440]  So he brokered a deal by which Procter and Gamble gave the American Heart Association in 1952 $1.7 million, which has kind of chumped change today, but back then it was a lot of money. And so they gave the American Heart Association $1.7 million to endorse this product called Crisco as a better, healthier way to cook rather than using lard and cream and butter.
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:32.440]  There was never any science to prove that they just took the money. The American Heart Association just took the money and endorsed Crisco as a healthier way to cook.
[1:44:32.440 --> 1:44:45.440]  Well, it turns out Procter and Gamble was having a real trouble selling this, and so they invented another sales campaign called the Mediterranean Diet. There was no science behind that.
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:55.440]  The average lifespan of Greece and Italy is only 62, but they took the Isle of Crete, which had people in their 80s still working out in the fields, and they said, oh, well, this is what we want to do.
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:45:04.440]  And they looked at olive oil and so forth, and they began to use olive oil and cooking oils and salad dressings and things, and we began to get heart disease because they were pushing that.
[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:17.440]  Well, at that moment, what happened was that the Mediterranean Diet was magic, and people just followed that and went on it, but the pharmaceutical companies jumped in and wanted it on.
[1:45:17.440 --> 1:45:24.440]  They said, oh, we're going to give you a product called Staten Drugs that will lower cholesterol and help everybody prevent heart disease.
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:34.440]  Well, it turns out they've killed a billion people, Alex, between Europe, Asia, the United States, South America, Central America, and Africa.
[1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:44.440]  They have caused cardiovascular disease in all these places with this Crisco and olive oil and coconut oil, and this is all because of these Staten Drugs.
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:52.440]  It's a multi-trillion-dollar business, and not only did they cause cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, with Crisco, they had a spin-off.
[1:45:52.440 --> 1:46:11.440]  They had a whole bunch of unintended consequences, including low T, low testosterone, ED, erectile dysfunction, menopause in women at age 30 because testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, and adrenal hormones are what we call steroid hormones,
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:14.440]  and they're 95% by weight cholesterol.
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:27.440]  So going on a cholesterol-restricted diet, eating egg beaters and egg white omelets, using margarine instead of butter, using cooking oils and Crisco instead of lard and butter and cream, they created a huge monster of a problem.
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:36.440]  Now, if it wasn't bad enough that we got low T, erectile dysfunction, menopause at age 30, and adrenal exhaustion, we got Alzheimer's disease.
[1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:44.440]  Alzheimer's disease is a direct cause of Staten drugs. Staten drugs causes Alzheimer's disease. It's not due to aluminum. It's not due to genetics.
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:48.440]  It is a direct cause, directly caused by the use of Staten drugs.
[1:46:48.440 --> 1:47:00.440]  In fact, in February of 2012, the FDA actually sent out a notice to all licensed doctors saying, stop writing prescriptions for Staten drugs.
[1:47:00.440 --> 1:47:05.440]  They listed 10 of them, Lipitor, Zocor, Mevacor, Levostatin, ones like that.
[1:47:05.440 --> 1:47:11.440]  And by the way, my dad was just reading medical journals in the late 80s and would never get up and cuss.
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:17.440]  But I remember him getting up from the couch and throwing a medical journal down going, I can't believe they're pushing these Staten's.
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:20.440]  And I've got to tell my mother not to be on them.
[1:47:20.440 --> 1:47:24.440]  And then literally, I know people who go on them and they're gone in a year.
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:29.440]  They are just, it's a lobotomy. Now explain, Dr. Wyatt, does this because it's simple.
[1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:36.440]  It's simple. Your brain is almost all cholesterol. It's mostly water. And so you take a drug that eats cholesterol or blocks it.
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:41.440]  I mean, this is incredible. This is like Drano for the brain. Explain it to people medically, Dr. Wallach.
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:47.440]  Okay. Well, your brain is, you're very good, Alex. You've been doing your research. I'm very proud of you, sir. Very good.
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:53.440]  The brain is 75% white matter, which is almost 100% cholesterol.
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:48:00.440]  And when the cholesterol goes away in your brain, when the white matter goes away in your brain, the myelin is called, when the myelin goes away in the brain,
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:05.440]  these naked nerve fibers all tangle up, which is the classic feature of Alzheimer's disease.
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:11.440]  All the nerve fibers in the brain, short circuit, and you can't remember anything. You can't do simple math.
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:16.440]  You can't do anything. You put your keys in the refrigerator. Life is a mess. You go downhill very rapidly.
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:23.440]  It doesn't matter if you're eight years old. I remember when the Pediatric Association were trying to get kids eight years old taking statin drugs,
[1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:24.440]  and I blocked that one.
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:28.440]  Oh, I saw Fox News. I have the clip saying they want to put it in the water.
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:31.440]  Exactly. No, no, no. We got to stop that.
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:38.440]  But what happens is when you take a statin drug, remember, the FDA came out and wrote and sent an email to every doctor in America
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:46.440]  to stop prescribing statin drugs in February of 2012, and not one doctor forwarded it to other patients. They just kept on doing it.
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:48.440]  It's a multi-trillion dollar business.
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:54.440]  And so anyway, what happens is when you drop your blood sugar down below 140, you cannot maintain the myelin in your brain.
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:49:03.440]  You have to have your blood cholesterol, excuse me, when you have your blood cholesterol below 140, you cannot maintain the myelin in the brain.
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:08.440]  So when you have your cholesterol level at about 250 is where you need to be.
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:14.440]  Well, let me expand on this. My uncle was in a motorcycle accident when he was 16, and he had epilepsy from the brain damage.
[1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:19.440]  He's still there. He just has motor problems and would have grand mal seizures and things.
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:23.440]  And they took him off most of the medication about 15 years ago and said,
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:33.440]  you must eat natural, healthy fats, and they gave him a list of things, the same thing you say, because I guess the doctor really cared about him, and it really helped him, and it cut it back about 80%.
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:41.440]  So explain to us what the doctors even knew 15, 16 years ago about the right type of fats to stop having epilepsy.
[1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:43.440]  I mean, this is incredible.
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:51.440]  Well, they knew this. This is what makes this criminal. This is a criminal thing now. Alex, you're the man to help me get this information out because you're a wonderful audience.
[1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:58.440]  You have to remember this statin drug thing and directing people to stay away from good fats.
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:03.440]  I always say a stick of butter a day keeps the doctor away. Ten eggs a day keeps the doctor away.
[1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:15.440]  And by reducing cholesterol below 140 and creating Alzheimer's disease, low T, things like erectile dysfunction, menopause, Alzheimer's disease,
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:22.440]  all these things are caused by getting your blood cholesterol below 140 and it's done with statin drugs and diet.
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:27.440]  It caused a one billion deaths worldwide in the industrialized world.
[1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:37.440]  And of course, I guess if there's any good news, there's no limit, no statutory limits on murder.
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:44.440]  That's right. Stay there. I want to hear how we turn this around, Dr. Wall, when we come back, because people now finally know, they go, oh, I've heard statins eat your brain.
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:48.440]  So at least, you know, 10 years ago, nobody knew this. So now it's getting out there.
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:52.440]  So it looks like we're making headway like a glyphosate or fluoride. What do we do?
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:51:18.440]  And can it be reversed or slowed down once you've been brain damaged by the statins? Stay with us.

[1:51:53.440 --> 1:52:02.440]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:09.440]  It's true. Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply. It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:14.440]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[1:54:53.440 --> 1:55:09.440]  How do we reverse this? How do we educate people? If somebody's been on statins, what do they do? How do we counter this?
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:14.440]  Education is exactly right, Alex. Two books will do that.
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:28.440]  And a couple of CDs, one book of the original Dead Doctrinal Live, which came out in 1997. And by the way, the audio cassette tape and the CD sold over $350 million, not $50 million, $350 million.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:30.440]  I was just going off an old biome.
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:53.440]  And the wonderful piece is a double-blind randomized study, 10 years old, and 5,000 people, 2,500 on the study program and 2,500 on the dummy program, and reduced the risk of Alzheimer's disease over a 10-year period in 5,000 people by 78%.
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:56:03.440]  It was just a very minimal supplement program, a certain diet, and it was actually a high fat diet, and the supplement program was just a couple of nutrients.
[1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:09.440]  And in animals with all 90 cents of nutrients and a proper high fat diet, it's 100% preventable.
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:19.440]  And I have reversed, I don't know, literally hundreds of people who've been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease with a very simple nutritional program and a dietary change.
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:25.440]  Somebody is going to have to be there to actually, you know, kind of a caregiver to make sure these people remember to take their supplements.
[1:56:25.440 --> 1:56:32.440]  But it's totally reversible, it's totally preventable, and because it's a simple nutritional deficiency disease.
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:50.440]  Ted's dad, who recently died, as you know, and I'm allowed to tell the story, even though it's very sad, they had him on blood thinner, he never had a stroke. He basically had scurvy because he wasn't getting vitamin C. He got on beyond Tangy Tangerine and went from not knowing who he was to knowing who he was and coming out of it.
[1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:57.440]  And the medical doctor basically told his mom, you take him off that, he's got too much vitamin K in his blood, and he didn't know who he was again in a couple of months.
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:08.440]  I mean, and he said, hey, it's my mom, my dad, they make their decisions, and she worshiped the doctor, and he just sat there and watched his dad go right back into it. Amazing story.
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:19.440]  Yeah, it's a terrible thing, the power that doctors have over people, especially older people, the older generation, they revered doctors more than they revered God, and that's why they're in trouble.
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:30.440]  And basically, again, Alzheimer's disease is a physician-caused disease. Every doctor should be charged with a felony every time they prescribe the statin drugs.
[1:57:30.440 --> 1:57:32.440]  It should be a felony to prescribe.
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:35.440]  Because they know it literally is your brain.
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:37.440]  That's correct.
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:45.440]  It's one of those things where, as predictable as gravity, you're going to get Alzheimer's disease, low T, ED, menopause at age 30, adrenal exhaustion, and Alzheimer's disease.
[1:57:45.440 --> 1:57:52.440]  And now they even admit that low-fat diets have frightened everybody. It's the bad synthetic trans fats, right, doctor? What are the good fats?
[1:57:52.440 --> 1:58:03.440]  Well, the good fats are butter, cholesterol, things like cream, butter, animal fat that's not burnt, imperative to maintain brain health and to maintain that.
[1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:05.440]  So you want raw fat as the best thing?
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:07.440]  That's correct.
[1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:14.440]  To be honest, it's very good to say then, eat like beef sushi where you just barely even heated on a rock or something, and that's what you need.
[1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:28.440]  Exactly. Raw beef is good. Just don't burn it, because if you burn the beef fat, or you burn pork fat, or you burn chicken skin, or you fry your eggs, it turns into, as you say, trans-fat, heterocyclic, means a calamity.
[1:58:28.440 --> 1:58:31.440]  And that's absolutely proven to give you colon cancer, you name it, absolutely.
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:35.440]  But then I distract us with the bad fat and say, all fat's good. Folks, we're based on it.
[1:58:35.440 --> 1:58:39.440]  Homo sapiens got big because of our meat diet when we changed over to it. It's why our brains got big.
[1:58:39.440 --> 1:58:40.440]  Thank you for listening to me.
[1:58:40.440 --> 1:58:46.440]  It's why we mutated like this. People say, what? That's evolution. It's God's plan, folks. We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:29.440]  We're introducing the best yet. The brand new ProPure ProMax high performance shower filter. It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong powerful flow.

[2:00:06.440 --> 2:00:11.440]  We now take you live.
[2:00:11.440 --> 2:00:18.440]  This is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[2:00:18.440 --> 2:00:19.440]  Yeah, I know people.
[2:00:19.440 --> 2:00:23.440]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:24.440]  Look, I know people.
[2:00:24.440 --> 2:00:29.440]  Live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:29.440 --> 2:00:37.440]  I know people that are gibbering mental patients now after a few years on statins. Totally different people.
[2:00:37.440 --> 2:00:39.440]  Their family go, no, they're like a kid now.
[2:00:39.440 --> 2:00:48.440]  And I mean, managers of companies, super sharp people, once a man, twice a child, and you know the statins are eating their brain.
[2:00:48.440 --> 2:00:51.440]  And they get skinny. They get gaunt. They're like zombies.
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:53.440]  You added this vegetarian diet bowl.
[2:00:53.440 --> 2:00:59.440]  Every vegetarian I know, they're either super skinny or they're fat. They look super tired.
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:01.440]  They're like dumb.
[2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:04.440]  I know you can eat enough beans and enough stuff and get what you need.
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:07.440]  I'm not knocking you in. There's a lot of dirty stuff about meat nowadays.
[2:01:07.440 --> 2:01:09.440]  I'm not judging you.
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:13.440]  The globalist want you on a vegetarian diet for a reason.
[2:01:13.440 --> 2:01:15.440]  It makes you very servile. It's known.
[2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:19.440]  Dr. Wallach, we're going to be back for a full hour very, very soon.
[2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:21.440]  I know you've got some big events coming up.
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:25.440]  Where do people find out about some of these big speaking events you're about to do in the next few days?
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:32.440]  Okay. Yeah. I'm here in North Carolina today and tomorrow.
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:34.440]  I can give those out if you want.
[2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:39.440]  The one today is at the Hilton Charlotte University Place.
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:40.440]  Exactly.
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:42.440]  Okay. And that's in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[2:01:42.440 --> 2:01:43.440]  There you go.
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:44.440]  There's some other big events coming up.
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:52.440]  It's at 7 p.m. and then tomorrow night it's at the Spring Hill Suites by Marriott on Johnson Road in Charlotte at 7 p.m.
[2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:57.440]  And then Thursday, Friday and Saturday we have events up in San Francisco.
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:02.440]  And so you might have people up in that area contact KSCO and Santa Cruz.
[2:02:02.440 --> 2:02:05.440]  KSCO, they'll have the event located.
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:07.440]  I apologize. I don't have those.
[2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:09.440]  We've got it on screen for folks.
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:14.440]  There you go. That's urljevd.com, guys.
[2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:16.440]  All right. Fantastic.
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:21.440]  Am I right, though, that something's going on with vegetarians?
[2:02:21.440 --> 2:02:24.440]  Oh, yeah. Well, see, you cannot get what you need.
[2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:30.440]  You need 90 cents of nutrients and vegetarians miss about 60 of them when they go vegetarian.
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:34.440]  They need to supplement. They could do it if they supplemented, but they believe they can get everything they need just by eating well.
[2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:36.440]  And that's absolutely wrong.
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:43.440]  When you look at the National Geographic, Alex, they came out all about 10 years ago with the top 20 longevity cultures.
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:45.440]  They're all heavy meat eaters.
[2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:48.440]  There's no vegetarians in the top 20 longevity cultures on Earth.
[2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:51.440]  They're all heavy meat eaters. They're all third world.
[2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:57.440]  None of them have any medical doctors or health insurance or emergency services or clinics or hospitals.
[2:02:57.440 --> 2:02:59.440]  Yet they have 40 times 100 as we do.
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:01.440]  They have 100 per 250 population.
[2:03:01.440 --> 2:03:05.440]  We only have 100 year old per 10,000.
[2:03:05.440 --> 2:03:09.440]  And so heavy meat eaters are the ones who live the longest and healthiest.
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:14.440]  Well, I mean, meat's a drug. I can be sick and go eat a big ribeye and, like, I feel better in hours.
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:18.440]  I mean, if it's rare, it's got to be bloody. It's got to be bloody.
[2:03:18.440 --> 2:03:22.440]  Yeah, medium rare. I just take every day. I eat 10 eggs every day.
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:26.440]  It gives you sex hormones like you can't believe. Yahoo!
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:33.440]  Well, there's no doubt that a study show larger CC brain sizes and the craniums growing over the thousands of years
[2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:36.440]  as people went from agrarian to meat eaters. I mean, it's true.
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:41.440]  Meat has turbocharged us and we're basically turning into predators.
[2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:49.440]  Yeah, exactly. Of course, we're turning into meat for predators if you become a vegetarian.
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:51.440]  You do not want to be a vegetarian without supplement.
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:54.440]  You can do it successfully. If you supplement, we have the 90th century nutrients.
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:04:00.440]  We hope that all people who are really died in the wool vegetarians and vegans come to young gibbety.
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:03.440]  We will give you a supplement program that will make it work for you.
[2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:05.440]  Without this supplement program, you're in trouble.
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:09.440]  Absolutely. And find that whole program at infowarshealth.com, infowarsteam.com.
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:16.440]  And Dr. Wall, let's get you up in the next few weeks for a full hour via Skype to get into the missing nutrients,
[2:04:16.440 --> 2:04:19.440]  to get more into the statins, to get into all this medicalized tyranny.
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:22.440]  They want forced inoculations now. I mean, it's getting crazy.
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:24.440]  Okay. Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:31.440]  And again, the book Dead Doctors Don't Lie and the book Epigenetics, The Death of the Genetic 3D Transmission.
[2:04:31.440 --> 2:04:36.440]  We love you, and we're going to work along your side, and between you and me, we'll make things happen.
[2:04:36.440 --> 2:04:42.440]  And by the way, we've got reviews on that, a five-star review for the package of books we've got discounted
[2:04:42.440 --> 2:04:48.440]  that Doctors Don't Lie and others at infowarslife.com and forstore.com has it all right there.
[2:04:48.440 --> 2:04:50.440]  Dr. Wall, thank you so much for the time today.
[2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:53.440]  Well, God bless you, sir. Thank you for the hospitality as usual.
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:57.440]  We love your audience, and we're there for you forever.
[2:04:57.440 --> 2:04:58.440]  You're revolutionary. God bless you.
[2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:02.440]  The FBI will soon interview Hillary Clinton over her private e-mail server.
[2:05:02.440 --> 2:05:06.440]  Federal prosecutors investigating the likely mishandling of classified materials on Clinton's server
[2:05:06.440 --> 2:05:09.440]  are already setting up formal interviews with some of her closest aides,
[2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:14.440]  according to insiders, which indicates the FBI investigation is nearing its final phases.
[2:05:14.440 --> 2:05:17.440]  These interviews will take several weeks, according to the LA Times,
[2:05:17.440 --> 2:05:21.440]  meaning that the scandal will continue to play Clinton throughout her presidential run.
[2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:25.440]  Back in 2009, former diplomatic security officials had an issue with Clinton
[2:05:25.440 --> 2:05:27.440]  even using her BlackBerry device in a secure office,
[2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:32.440]  worried that foreign spies could hack it and transform the BlackBerry into a listening device.
[2:05:32.440 --> 2:05:36.440]  Little did they know that her BlackBerry was connected to her private,
[2:05:36.440 --> 2:05:39.440]  unsecured e-mail server where she kept highly classified documents,
[2:05:39.440 --> 2:05:41.440]  including material labeled beyond top secret.
[2:05:41.440 --> 2:05:44.440]  Of course, security officials had no way of doing anything about it
[2:05:44.440 --> 2:05:46.440]  because they had no idea the server even existed.
[2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:52.440]  And that's the point, the server allowed Clinton to avoid releasing e-mails to the public as part of the Freedom of Information Act.
[2:05:52.440 --> 2:06:17.440]  This is Kit Daniels, and visit Infowars.com for more reports.
[2:06:17.440 --> 2:06:29.440]  Welcome to the Infowar.
[2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:58.440]  Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[2:06:58.440 --> 2:07:10.440]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[2:07:10.440 --> 2:07:13.440]  I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down.
[2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:15.440]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[2:07:15.440 --> 2:07:17.440]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:20.440]  I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them.
[2:07:20.440 --> 2:07:24.440]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[2:07:24.440 --> 2:07:28.440]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it.
[2:07:28.440 --> 2:07:32.440]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise
[2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:37.440]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[2:07:37.440 --> 2:07:41.440]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force.
[2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:47.440]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[2:07:47.440 --> 2:07:56.440]  You will find brain force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:13.440]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:17.440]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:08:19.440 --> 2:08:22.440]  It happens to me on the street pretty much every day.
[2:08:22.440 --> 2:08:25.440]  It happens when I see old friends.
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:31.440]  They say, hey, I kind of like Trump, but I'm scared to admit it. People will call me names.
[2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:38.440]  And I just look at people and I say, are we a free country? Are you a man or are you a mouse?
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:43.440]  I mean, it's really that simple. If a bunch of fad-driven morons,
[2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:48.440]  because everything from the Economist to Time Magazine to the Pope and the Communist Chinese government,
[2:08:48.440 --> 2:08:52.440]  says Donald Trump's a demon, and the Republican establishment says,
[2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:56.440]  all over the news, what Stone told us 8 months ago first, we're going to just take the nomination.
[2:08:56.440 --> 2:09:02.440]  We're allowed to. That is the seal of approval with Donald Trump.
[2:09:02.440 --> 2:09:07.440]  Because he's against globalism. He's against unfair trade deals.
[2:09:07.440 --> 2:09:10.440]  And then he actually wants to be president.
[2:09:10.440 --> 2:09:14.440]  The globalists sold out America for global power.
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:18.440]  Trump wants to reverse that. They're scared of him for a good reason.
[2:09:18.440 --> 2:09:24.440]  And they've got John Sununu and every other talking head on TV everywhere saying,
[2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:27.440]  Hillary destroys him by 10 points in polls.
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:31.440]  And, you know, he's unelectable and thank God we're going to take the nomination away from him.
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:35.440]  That's a talking point.
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:40.440]  The polls really show Trump neck and neck or ahead of her.
[2:09:40.440 --> 2:09:45.440]  And the facade is starting to fall with things like Russell's Belgium happening,
[2:09:45.440 --> 2:09:49.440]  right when Trump predicted it would.
[2:09:49.440 --> 2:09:54.440]  So now we have student president freaking out over Trump 2016 written on whiteboard,
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:09:58.440]  claims scrawling, constitutes racist violence.
[2:09:58.440 --> 2:10:01.440]  Other universities are having huge psychology meetings,
[2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:06.440]  as everyone panics and cries because someone wrote Trump 2016 in chalk.
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:10.440]  This is the mindless hysteria.
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:13.440]  And the hype that is unprecedented.
[2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:17.440]  Now joining us the next 40 minutes or so is Roger Stone,
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:21.440]  confident former campaign head for Trump.
[2:10:21.440 --> 2:10:25.440]  And he promised us on Monday last week he offered and I said,
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:28.440]  well, of course, an exclusive article about a big development,
[2:10:28.440 --> 2:10:31.440]  but he's ready to really do that on Wednesday,
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:33.440]  but he has some other big developments today.
[2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:36.440]  So I'll be popping back in on Wednesday, stonezone.com.
[2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:39.440]  Walker will endorse Cruz in Wisconsin Push.
[2:10:39.440 --> 2:10:43.440]  That's the story on infowars.com.
[2:10:43.440 --> 2:10:46.440]  And he also, of course, predicted months ago and in the week before that
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:49.440]  Jeb Bush would be endorsing Cruz.
[2:10:49.440 --> 2:10:51.440]  Now we know why he called George Herbert Walker Bush,
[2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:56.440]  you know, his ideological mentor and what he, you know, admires in the world.
[2:10:56.440 --> 2:10:58.440]  Bush has run his campaign.
[2:10:58.440 --> 2:11:02.440]  They always did as a stand in in case they rejected the Bush name.
[2:11:02.440 --> 2:11:08.440]  This is the Bush family seeking their fourth term and their ally
[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:10.440]  with the Clinton crime family.
[2:11:10.440 --> 2:11:11.440]  It's amazing.
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:14.440]  But this is a war between hype and reality.
[2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:18.440]  Can the system pull out a scam one more time and cheat Trump or convince
[2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:20.440]  the public not to support him?
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:24.440]  Because regardless of who Trump is, this is a test of populism.
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:29.440]  We're seeing the establishment to come out and say, oh, we have rule changes.
[2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:32.440]  We're not going to, we don't care if he gets all the delights.
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:37.440]  We're just going to appoint somebody like Paul Ryan or somebody like Mitt Romney.
[2:11:37.440 --> 2:11:42.440]  So we now have appointed people from the quote party, the greatest fraud ever seen.
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:43.440]  He calls it the big steal.
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:46.440]  I call it canceling the election.
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:51.440]  So headline, Roger Stone, will they cancel the election?
[2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:55.440]  Because if you steal the nominations, if you give it to Hillary, if you clearly
[2:11:55.440 --> 2:11:58.440]  Sanders is destroying her everywhere and she's stealing it.
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:11:59.440]  Did it in New Hampshire?
[2:11:59.440 --> 2:12:00.440]  You name it.
[2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:03.440]  And they're openly admitting that they may, even if it's 1200 plus delegates,
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:05.440]  take it from Trump.
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:08.440]  They may want to blow up the Republican Party and hand it to Hillary
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:10.440]  because they were always Rhino operatives.
[2:12:10.440 --> 2:12:12.440]  But it will blow up the Democrats too.
[2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:17.440]  I predict if they steal it from Trump, nakedly, that it will be the end of the
[2:12:17.440 --> 2:12:21.440]  establishment because they have just, just, just really pulled their pants down
[2:12:21.440 --> 2:12:23.440]  and, and, and mooned the public.
[2:12:23.440 --> 2:12:24.440]  Am I right?
[2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:28.440]  Roger stone of stone zone.com.
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:30.440]  Well, Alex, I think it remains to be seen.
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:33.440]  First of all, all of this tapes talk about steak.
[2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:38.440]  I'm ready for a thick old porterhouse right about now.
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:42.440]  It was a beautiful day on the beaches in Florida this week.
[2:12:42.440 --> 2:12:49.440]  And, and I heard from many of my allies by cell phone, make no mistake about it.
[2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:52.440]  The big steel is on and it doesn't begin in Cleveland.
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:53.440]  It's already begun.
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:59.440]  And as we have revealed here on info wars.com in the past, it has two elements.
[2:12:59.440 --> 2:13:04.440]  One is to try to stall Donald Trump short of the 1237 that he needs to be
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:06.440]  nominated in absolute majority.
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:11.440]  And the keystone to doing that, of course, is in the contests that lie ahead.
[2:13:11.440 --> 2:13:18.440]  Now, Ted Cruz would need to win 87% of the delegates available of those still
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:21.440]  unchosen a mathematical impossibility.
[2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:28.440]  Trump has a more realistic 527 that he needs and he is leading big in states
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:33.440]  like California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania where the establishment
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:38.440]  and the king makers have found what they think is the weak link is Wisconsin.
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:48.440]  So now what you're going to see is a Paul Ryan, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:52.440]  all out assault on Trump in Wisconsin.
[2:13:52.440 --> 2:13:57.440]  Now, ironically, if you're doing a vote count, Trump does not have to win
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:13:58.440]  Wisconsin.
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:00.440]  He still has additional places to gain.
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:05.440]  But Wisconsin is must win for Ted Cruz to remain viable.
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:09.440]  Make no mistake about where the bosses are.
[2:14:09.440 --> 2:14:15.440]  They may be potentially and temporarily wedded to Ted Cruz.
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:20.440]  But at the end of the day, this convention will either be Ted Cruz,
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:25.440]  pardon me, Donald Trump on the first ballot or Paul Ryan on the fourth.
[2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:29.440]  The establishment basically they can get that opening.
[2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:33.440]  They will move to an open convention if they can't stall Trump short.
[2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:40.440]  If he has the 1237, then beware the Trojan horse delegates that we've discussed.
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:46.440]  Those who are pledged to vote for Trump on the first ballot, but will desert him on the
[2:14:46.440 --> 2:14:47.440]  second ballot.
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:53.440]  But more importantly, will vote for rules and delegates seating that are harmful to
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:54.440]  Trump.
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:14:56.440]  That's the big deal.
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:15:02.440]  Right now, the bosses are packing the crucial rules and credentials committee,
[2:15:02.440 --> 2:15:05.440]  not with Trump people, but with hacks.
[2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:10.440]  Stooges with people who are who will follow orders in the big deal.
[2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:16.440]  And it's what's amazing to me, Alex, is that the plotters plot in open.
[2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:25.440]  In the circus recently, recently, the very hot net based theories.
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:30.440]  You have a go as pollster for the establishment and Rogers fact hat lobbyist,
[2:15:30.440 --> 2:15:36.440]  Ron Kaufman, fact hat lobbyist, Republican National Committee man from Massachusetts,
[2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:42.440]  Rick Holt, lobbyist, talking about how Trump will be stopped, talking about why he must
[2:15:42.440 --> 2:15:45.440]  be stopped, denigrating Trump.
[2:15:45.440 --> 2:15:48.440]  The plotters plot in the open.
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:50.440]  They plot in the open.
[2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:52.440]  And, you know, all bets are off.
[2:15:52.440 --> 2:15:55.440]  The big deal is going forward.
[2:15:55.440 --> 2:15:57.440]  The article is on info wars.com.
[2:15:57.440 --> 2:16:00.440]  I want to peg to the top of our Facebook, Twitter.
[2:16:00.440 --> 2:16:03.440]  I want the listeners to get this out to everybody because you may have heard eight
[2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:05.440]  months ago all this from Roger Stone.
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:06.440]  Now it's happening.
[2:16:06.440 --> 2:16:08.440]  You heard about the Koch brothers secret meetings months before they admitted it.
[2:16:08.440 --> 2:16:09.440]  They denied it.
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:10.440]  Now they admit it.
[2:16:10.440 --> 2:16:12.440]  You're now you heard about Jeb before it happened.
[2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:15.440]  Now Walker will endorse Cruz and Wisconsin push.
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:16.440]  The big deal is on.
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:20.440]  This needs to get out to talk show host all across the country needs to get out to
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:23.440]  your friends and family to really see what's happening.
[2:16:23.440 --> 2:16:24.440]  We'll play the clip after the break.
[2:16:24.440 --> 2:16:28.440]  It's short, but when he, you know, supposedly one Utah.
[2:16:28.440 --> 2:16:30.440]  When he went, I've got Jeb Bush.
[2:16:30.440 --> 2:16:35.440]  I've got he is so proud of that now.
[2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:38.440]  And people say, well, that's like an albatross around his neck.
[2:16:38.440 --> 2:16:41.440]  Jeb Bush was like pulling one or 2% the whole time.
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:42.440]  Everybody hates him.
[2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:43.440]  He doesn't care.
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:44.440]  He knows there's a big steel.
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:49.440]  He now wants to supine gravel prostrate himself to the bushes and the Republican
[2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:54.440]  establishment so that they will crown him and not put in somebody in front of him.
[2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:59.440]  I mean, this is the most disgusting thing where he is now electioneering to the blue
[2:16:59.440 --> 2:17:03.440]  blood Rhino Neocon skeleton.
[2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:05.440]  This is insane.
[2:17:05.440 --> 2:17:07.440]  Well, Alex, but let's be candid.
[2:17:07.440 --> 2:17:09.440]  Those are Ted Cruz's roots.
[2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:12.440]  Ted Cruz was George W. Bush's issues, man.
[2:17:12.440 --> 2:17:13.440]  The year he ran for.
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:14.440]  No, I agree.
[2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:15.440]  But now it's all confirmed.
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:16.440]  Now it's all confirmed.
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:19.440]  So, so their dislike of Ted is personal.
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:20.440]  It's because he's prickly.
[2:17:20.440 --> 2:17:25.440]  It doesn't have to do with the fact that he doesn't support their, their, their world
[2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:30.440]  viewer didn't mastermind the Bush v Gore legal strategy to steal the election.
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:31.440]  Ted Cruz did that.
[2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:34.440]  I know I was part of that recount team.
[2:17:34.440 --> 2:17:38.440]  He is the legal genius behind the grab of that election.
[2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:42.440]  So he is a Bush by by lineage.
[2:17:42.440 --> 2:17:45.440]  He is a Bush retainer by history.
[2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:49.440]  His wife is a member on the council on foreign relations.
[2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:54.440]  They're not happy because they don't like him personally.
[2:17:54.440 --> 2:18:00.440]  Bush, Cruz, Ryan, Walker, they're all globalists.
[2:18:00.440 --> 2:18:02.440]  Rubio, they're all globalists.
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:03.440]  Let me ask you this.
[2:18:03.440 --> 2:18:05.440]  I know you're focused on stopping the big deal on Wednesday.
[2:18:05.440 --> 2:18:08.440]  You'll talk about some plans to do that and some big news you've been working on.
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:11.440]  But specifically though, I get there arrogant.
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:13.440]  I get they want to hand it to Hillary.
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:14.440]  I understand all that.
[2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:18.440]  Does it the establishment get that this isn't the people are really going to get even more
[2:18:18.440 --> 2:18:19.440]  angry?
[2:18:19.440 --> 2:18:20.440]  This isn't going to go away.
[2:18:20.440 --> 2:18:24.440]  I mean, if they're going to openly appoint presidents now, I mean, they really are going
[2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:28.440]  to do this because they're on the news, shelling on every channel like it's no big deal.
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:34.440]  You know, it's very amazing to me is that Bill Crystal and the neocons who are members
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:40.440]  of the plotters, active members of the plotters and not look, I like Bill Crystal on a personal
[2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:41.440]  level.
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:46.440]  I recognize he was a big supporter of Hubert Humphrey in 1968 and then he comes from a liberal
[2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:47.440]  Democrat background.
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:48.440]  But I like Bill Crystal.
[2:18:48.440 --> 2:18:54.440]  On the other hand, Crystal started this never Trump hashtag, which the Republican establishment
[2:18:54.440 --> 2:18:56.440]  has picked up.
[2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:59.440]  Interestingly now, Trump partisans have begun.
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:01.440]  We will walk hashtag.
[2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:02.440]  We will walk.
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:10.440]  They've established a Facebook page and they have signed up more people than the neocon
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:12.280]  put forward by Crystal.
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:18.240]  People need to realize that the king makers will ruin the possibility that Pat Buchanan
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:23.880]  has spoken about a new populist based Republican party returning the party to its mainstream
[2:19:23.880 --> 2:19:26.440]  roots, not its wall street.
[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:30.280]  Well, even mainstream media admits there's a tea party battle through Trump to take the
[2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:32.940]  Republican Party, but they act like it's a horrible thing.
[2:19:32.940 --> 2:19:34.840]  Let's keep it in the hands of the blue bloods.
[2:19:34.840 --> 2:19:36.840]  Wow, this is really over the top.
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:40.520]  I think this is going to completely pull back the curtain.
[2:19:40.520 --> 2:19:47.240]  Well, and here Alex is one more bombshell, very well connected sources tell me that
[2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:52.840]  George Soros is now funneling money to people around John Kasich in order to keep Kasich
[2:19:52.840 --> 2:19:54.160]  in the race.
[2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.160]  Why?
[2:19:55.160 --> 2:19:58.400]  Because Kasich could be a vice presidential candidate here.
[2:19:58.400 --> 2:20:02.760]  If Trump falls short, Kasich is sitting on 66 delegates.
[2:20:02.760 --> 2:20:08.800]  That would be an abhorrent choice to me for me personally, but perhaps Soros believes
[2:20:08.800 --> 2:20:13.720]  the kind of pressure that was put on Trump to take Bush could be put on Trump to take
[2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:14.720]  Kasich.
[2:20:14.720 --> 2:20:17.160]  Therefore, he is keeping Kasich in the race.
[2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:21.980]  This is much to the consternation of the other globalists.
[2:20:21.980 --> 2:20:24.720]  This is making it harder for their hand chosen boy.
[2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:29.960]  But as I've told you many times in the Bilderbergers, in the Council on Foreign Relations, in the
[2:20:29.960 --> 2:20:35.440]  Trilateral Commission, among the elites, they have their own internal power struggles.
[2:20:35.440 --> 2:20:41.320]  Soros wants to be dominant, and I believe that he is keeping Kasich in this race.
[2:20:41.320 --> 2:20:45.640]  Wow, so that's, you've always got more bombshells.
[2:20:45.640 --> 2:20:50.680]  Obviously, Trump now is talking about them trying to steal it from him, thank God.
[2:20:50.680 --> 2:20:53.680]  Now he's forcing that issue, and the media has to sit there with a straight face and
[2:20:53.680 --> 2:20:57.600]  go, can you believe Trump saying it's terrible that the Republicans say they may steal the
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:20:59.320]  nomination from the voters?
[2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:04.880]  I mean, how dare he, and he said something even more incredible, I mean, it's absolutely
[2:21:04.880 --> 2:21:07.960]  blowing up in their face from what I'm seeing in the public, because when you first said
[2:21:07.960 --> 2:21:10.960]  they might do this or we're going to do this, eight months ago, people kind of rolled their
[2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:11.960]  eyes.
[2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:15.880]  Then four months ago, people were concerned, now that they're openly saying it, people
[2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:16.880]  aren't buying it.
[2:21:16.880 --> 2:21:17.880]  They're like going, what?
[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:18.880]  I mean, wow.
[2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:21.160]  But Alex, they're not just saying it.
[2:21:21.160 --> 2:21:22.160]  They're doing it.
[2:21:22.160 --> 2:21:23.160]  Let's look at what's transpired here.
[2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:25.800]  You're saying the steal is actually happening now.
[2:21:25.800 --> 2:21:30.520]  In Texas, where Donald Trump is entitled to 40 votes, the bodies in those chairs will
[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:36.080]  be stooges for the Rick Perry, George P. Bush, look, look at Louisiana, where they said
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:38.720]  that Trump won, but Cruz got the delegates.
[2:21:38.720 --> 2:21:44.520]  Yes, they gave, they gave Cruz five uncommitted delegates, unbound delegates, and they grabbed
[2:21:44.520 --> 2:21:45.520]  five delegates.
[2:21:45.520 --> 2:21:52.000]  Now, even though Trump won by almost 5% in Louisiana, and no one's talking about Louisiana
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  stolen from Trump.
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:58.760]  Louisiana voters had their elections stolen, and it wasn't even a headline.
[2:21:58.760 --> 2:22:01.680]  They were just, Ted Cruz gets it, sorry, he lost, but he wins.
[2:22:01.680 --> 2:22:02.880]  It's like Hillary, New Hampshire.
[2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:06.540]  So let's go through where the other steals are going on, because I've never seen such
[2:22:06.540 --> 2:22:07.540]  naked stealing.
[2:22:07.540 --> 2:22:08.540]  Go ahead.
[2:22:08.540 --> 2:22:11.080]  Well, Texas, I think, is the most egregious.
[2:22:11.080 --> 2:22:16.000]  Carl Tepper, the chairman of Lubbock County, very respected chairman of the Republican
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:20.600]  County Chairman's Association, has essentially been stiff.
[2:22:20.600 --> 2:22:22.040]  He's been told directly, sorry.
[2:22:22.040 --> 2:22:24.920]  There will be no Trump people on this delegation.
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:25.920]  Why is that significant?
[2:22:25.920 --> 2:22:30.400]  Well, those 40 votes that must vote for Trump on the first ballot, those people will be
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:34.120]  able to vote against Trump on rules and procedural matters.
[2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:36.920]  That's where the big steal will take place.
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:39.700]  That's where they stuck it to Ron Paul.
[2:22:39.700 --> 2:22:44.920]  That's where Ben Ginsburg and the same king makers, Ginsburg being the shrewdest, probably
[2:22:44.920 --> 2:22:51.040]  cleverest and most devious of the inside lawyers who know these rules inside and out.
[2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:54.200]  That is where the creativity and the railroad will happen.
[2:22:54.200 --> 2:22:57.680]  And then that decision must be ratified by the full convention.
[2:22:57.680 --> 2:22:58.680]  Sure.
[2:22:58.680 --> 2:23:01.280]  But you think they're bold enough to be able to care about.
[2:23:01.280 --> 2:23:02.280]  You're right.
[2:23:02.280 --> 2:23:03.280]  They don't care what they're talking about.
[2:23:03.280 --> 2:23:04.280]  You're right.
[2:23:04.280 --> 2:23:05.280]  The steal is happening.
[2:23:05.280 --> 2:23:06.280]  It's ongoing.
[2:23:06.280 --> 2:23:07.280]  They're already doing it.
[2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:08.280]  That's the news.
[2:23:08.280 --> 2:23:09.280]  The steal has already begun.
[2:23:09.280 --> 2:23:10.960]  But are they jumping the shark?
[2:23:10.960 --> 2:23:14.720]  I mean, how do they think they're going to actually do this for the first time ever in
[2:23:14.720 --> 2:23:19.160]  front of everyone and just say, we make the rules when they always hold out your popular
[2:23:19.160 --> 2:23:20.560]  vote matters and they honor it?
[2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:21.560]  This is unprecedented.
[2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:26.120]  Well, I think what's happening here is the establishment is greatly underestimating once
[2:23:26.120 --> 2:23:27.680]  again Donald Trump.
[2:23:27.680 --> 2:23:37.000]  They assume that he will not understand these complex rules and the arcane system of winning
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.240]  these delegates and counting these delegates.
[2:23:39.240 --> 2:23:44.520]  This is really about vote counting and accurate vote counting more than anything else.
[2:23:44.520 --> 2:23:49.280]  And we're going to see whether Trump is able to go from a winning primary campaign where
[2:23:49.280 --> 2:23:53.480]  he has run the table, but with a very anti-party strategy.
[2:23:53.480 --> 2:23:58.880]  I mean, recognize the people who are storming the gates are not party regulars.
[2:23:58.880 --> 2:24:03.200]  In Texas, the delegates must be chosen from among the people who were delegates to the
[2:24:03.200 --> 2:24:04.520]  last state convention.
[2:24:04.520 --> 2:24:06.020]  Nobody else is eligible.
[2:24:06.020 --> 2:24:10.240]  So some new Trump person new to the process has zero chance.
[2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:11.880]  They're stealing in South Carolina.
[2:24:11.880 --> 2:24:13.800]  They're stealing in Louisiana.
[2:24:13.800 --> 2:24:15.360]  They're going to steal in Colorado.
[2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:18.320]  They're going to steal in Arizona and they're going to steal in North Dakota.
[2:24:18.320 --> 2:24:21.000]  Look for those next at all levels.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:26.160]  The establishment is out to chisel votes here and there from Donald Trump around the edges,
[2:24:26.160 --> 2:24:30.160]  but then putting all their eggs in the Wisconsin basket.
[2:24:30.160 --> 2:24:35.700]  In the end, California will be as important to Donald Trump as it was in the nomination
[2:24:35.700 --> 2:24:38.960]  of Barry Goldwater in 1964.
[2:24:38.960 --> 2:24:41.400]  California is the big enchilada.
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:44.360]  California is where Donald Trump will ultimately wrap it up.
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:49.040]  I'm highly confident that Chris Christie will deliver a solid delegation to Donald Trump
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:50.540]  from New Jersey.
[2:24:50.540 --> 2:24:58.440]  New York is in fine hands with the activist Tea Party Wildman and my friend, Carl Paladino,
[2:24:58.440 --> 2:25:03.520]  the best grassroots organizer by far in New York state.
[2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:08.240]  So I'm confident about every place, but I'm telling you, the showdown is in the Badger's
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:17.960]  Day, Paul Ryan, plus the Cokes, plus Walker, $25 million, at least, in outside money from
[2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:22.160]  the cruise campaign, cruise packs, anti-Trump packs.
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:29.520]  We're talking about mail, phone calls, internet ads, cable ads, radio ads, broadcast TV.
[2:25:29.520 --> 2:25:34.400]  It hasn't worked anyplace else, but the establishment is going to try it one more time.
[2:25:34.400 --> 2:25:39.280]  Well, you know, too, the talking point is Hillary beats him, Hillary beats him, droning,
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:42.200]  droning, droning, droning, they never shut up.
[2:25:42.200 --> 2:25:45.240]  And I think it's backfiring, but I'll tell you, you've been in this a lot longer than
[2:25:45.240 --> 2:25:46.240]  I have.
[2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:51.080]  I've never historically seen anything this naked, except in communist countries that
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:52.080]  claim they have elections.
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:56.680]  I mean, this is, this, I think, if they steal it, well, that's another question Trump started
[2:25:56.680 --> 2:25:59.640]  to say, people are going to get mad, and they say he's calling for riots.
[2:25:59.640 --> 2:26:03.160]  Black Lives Matter run by Soros and others say they're coming to riot.
[2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:05.040]  This is going to get very, very explosive.
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:06.040]  Yeah.
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:10.960]  I mean, look, I am totally untroubled by polls that show Trump slightly behind Hillary.
[2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:16.200]  In all honesty, that's because Bernie Sanders has not hit her where she was vulnerable.
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:22.840]  He has never mentioned her epic abuse of women, and the fact that she was an accessory after
[2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:25.040]  the fact that every one of her husbands-
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:27.240]  He's never brought out her field whitewater indictment.
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:31.920]  I mean, he's never brought up the whitewater stuff, the billions from foreigners.
[2:26:31.920 --> 2:26:33.880]  I mean, she is so easy.
[2:26:33.880 --> 2:26:35.240]  What's the word on indictment?
[2:26:35.240 --> 2:26:37.040]  Because they said they're getting pretty close to indicting her.
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:38.760]  You think that's a baloney?
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:41.920]  I'm just telling you the stone prediction on this.
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:49.760]  The FBI director will recommend her indictment, and Obama will pardon her before the Justice
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:53.120]  Department can act.
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:54.560]  And then we'll have a pardoned president.
[2:26:54.560 --> 2:26:56.360]  That'll be a first, if she will.
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:26:58.040]  Well, here's what we don't know.
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:27:03.000]  Because he pardoned her in return for taking a dive, and Uncle Joe Biden, who's been barring
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  up and the bullpen jumps in, or do they actually think she can limp through an election with
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:08.880]  this around her neck?
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:12.800]  Recognizing the president would have giant leverage, because she's not going to want
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:17.840]  to go to trial, because that's heading to an orange jumpsuit, and it's about time.
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:22.360]  So I still predict that he leverages a pardon, but where the Democrats go from there, I don't
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:23.360]  think we know.
[2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:25.400]  Well, that's what the smart money's saying.
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:28.440]  They say there's a war of blackmail going on, but they're done with Hillary, and they
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:31.040]  know that the FBI will be totally discredited if they don't indict.
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:34.640]  If they've now announced they're going to interview her, they got over a hundred agents
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:35.640]  on her.
[2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:37.920]  I mean, they wouldn't be doing that if they weren't getting ready to bring her down.
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:42.480]  I mean, it's so obvious she did something a thousand times worse than Petraeus.
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:44.600]  They knew people were accessing her blackberry.
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:46.520]  They knew they were listening to the audio.
[2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:47.720]  This woman is insane.
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:51.440]  Her arrogance, her arrogance only eclipses her evil.
[2:27:51.440 --> 2:27:57.840]  Well, and it doesn't require criminal intent, criminal negligence alone is an easy case.
[2:27:57.840 --> 2:28:01.840]  There's an overwhelming abundance of evidence, is not a close case.
[2:28:01.840 --> 2:28:06.240]  She has abused federal documents, but the real question here is, does she have some kind
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:09.440]  of a Mexican standoff with Barack Obama?
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:14.440]  Because Hillary, I think, is able to illuminate us on the role of Valerie Jarrett in Benghazi,
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:17.560]  something I suspect the president wouldn't like too much focus on.
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:22.840]  And therefore, they may have a deal in which she can broker a pardon and still try to get
[2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:29.440]  over the finish line because of the demographic changes in the country.
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:34.040]  She's not pursuing the old Clinton strategy, trying to fool white moderates in the South
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:38.920]  and the West and trying to put together the old working class Democratic coalition.
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:42.120]  She and Sidney Blumenthal have a far left strategy.
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:49.080]  It's the Obama strategy, minorities plus the far left and liberals and you eke out a majority.
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:50.080]  That's their strategy.
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:53.160]  And that's why they've gone thermal nuclear with the race baiting and everything.
[2:28:53.160 --> 2:28:56.600]  You can really see the future with these guys is a really scary country.
[2:28:56.600 --> 2:29:00.840]  It looks like they're going to try to go full authoritarian with a socialist slash communist
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:01.840]  model.
[2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:03.400]  This could be really one of the last real elections.
[2:29:03.400 --> 2:29:07.440]  I think that's why you see them getting ready to steal it on both fronts because the gloves
[2:29:07.440 --> 2:29:08.440]  are coming off.
[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:12.640]  Wow, did you ever think you'd see stuff like this in politics as crazy as it was when you
[2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:13.640]  were.
[2:29:13.640 --> 2:29:22.320]  Yeah, look, I must tell you, I have worked on numerous recounts and I have seen very
[2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:27.600]  close and competitive primaries, but I must tell you, I've never seen anything like the
[2:29:27.600 --> 2:29:33.080]  level of complaints that we are getting from Utah in connection with voting irregularities
[2:29:33.080 --> 2:29:34.080]  and voting fraud.
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:35.080]  Stay there.
[2:29:35.080 --> 2:29:39.600]  We'll be right back in three minutes with Roger Stone stone stone dot com out there in

[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:50.640]  stone dot com on all the shows.
[2:29:50.640 --> 2:29:57.560]  We're on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:57.560 --> 2:30:01.800]  Today is Monday, March 28th and here are some of the top stories from this past weekend
[2:30:01.800 --> 2:30:02.800]  and today.
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:07.440]  The Islamic State reportedly crucified a Catholic priest on Good Friday as part of its ongoing
[2:30:07.440 --> 2:30:09.040]  war against Christianity.
[2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:12.600]  Father Tom Hoonzaaliel was kidnapped by ISIS gunmen while they attacked an old people's
[2:30:12.600 --> 2:30:16.000]  home in southern Yemen, killing at least 15 people on March 4th.
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:19.120]  Several religious groups had received threats that Father Thomas would be crucified on
[2:30:19.120 --> 2:30:23.080]  Good Friday, but this was denied by his church in his hometown of Bangalore.
[2:30:23.080 --> 2:30:28.000]  However, the Archbishop of Vienna told a congregation gathered in St. Stephen's Cathedral in the
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:30.480]  Austrian capital that the priest had been crucified.
[2:30:30.480 --> 2:30:34.600]  It is not known how the Archbishop became aware of Father Thomas' alleged faith, but
[2:30:34.600 --> 2:30:38.160]  his confirmation of the crucifixion was reported in the Austrian media.
[2:30:38.160 --> 2:30:39.760]  Other details have not yet emerged.
[2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:44.280]  In other news, Japan's space agency has lost contact with the steep space satellite equipped
[2:30:44.280 --> 2:30:47.720]  with X-ray telescopes designed to study the secrets of space.
[2:30:47.720 --> 2:30:51.560]  The satellite is surrounded by five pieces of debris, which could be its own parts, and
[2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:54.560]  it's been bearing off course since Saturday, as reported by RT.
[2:30:54.560 --> 2:30:58.360]  For more news, visit infowarst.com, this is Kit Daniels reporting.
[2:30:58.360 --> 2:31:01.760]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.

[2:33:07.960 --> 2:33:11.960]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[2:33:11.960 --> 2:33:18.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:18.960 --> 2:33:20.960]  I'm back to Roger Stone here in just a moment.
[2:33:20.960 --> 2:33:21.960]  He's with us for another 10 minutes.
[2:33:21.960 --> 2:33:29.960]  I want to play this clip, his victory speech in Utah, which Stone's about to get into, where he magically wins.
[2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:32.960]  Massive reports of fraud.
[2:33:32.960 --> 2:33:37.960]  And we've seen him in Louisiana get 10 delegates.
[2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:39.960]  They just took him.
[2:33:39.960 --> 2:33:41.960]  And it was just in the front of the paper.
[2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:44.960]  Louisiana crews loses, but it goes to him.
[2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:45.960]  And they don't say it's a fraud.
[2:33:45.960 --> 2:33:52.960]  They just go like the head of the rules committee for the election.
[2:33:52.960 --> 2:33:58.960]  He got up on CNBC and he went, oh, no, people think there's a popular vote.
[2:33:58.960 --> 2:33:59.960]  The media keeps saying it.
[2:33:59.960 --> 2:34:00.960]  The party makes the decision.
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:02.960]  She goes, well, then why have the primary votes?
[2:34:02.960 --> 2:34:03.960]  He goes, that's a good point.
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:04.960]  We just get rid of it.
[2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:10.960]  So they have to normalize, I guess, like kidnapping your wife and raping her or something.
[2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:12.960]  I mean, you're supposed to pledge his delegates.
[2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:13.960]  Go and do it.
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:14.960]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:16.960]  Change the rules in the 70s to be able to steal it.
[2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:19.960]  But so what you chose stole the rules.
[2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:20.960]  These are elections.
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:21.960]  These are public elections.
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:23.960]  There's money involved running the elections.
[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:27.960]  Private groups honorarily control it because of the party that predates it.
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:32.960]  But you're grandfathered in to honor it, not to openly steal it.
[2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:33.960]  It's amazing.
[2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:35.960]  And that's the view.
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:36.960]  That's the view of common law.
[2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:37.960]  It's history.
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:39.960]  But these lawyers want to tell you they're allowed to do it.
[2:34:39.960 --> 2:34:42.960]  Well, next they'll tell you that your kids belong to them.
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:43.960]  Like Melissa Harris Perry does.
[2:34:43.960 --> 2:34:48.960]  I want to play this clip of Ted Cruz where he endorses the establishment endorsing him.
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:49.960]  It is truly sycophantic.
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:56.960]  What we are seeing happening all across this country is Republicans are uniting behind our campaign.
[2:34:56.960 --> 2:35:00.960]  Republicans are coming together and uniting behind our campaign.
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:11.960]  In the last 10 days, our campaign has been supported by Jet Bush.
[2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:30.960]  All right, let's stop right there.
[2:35:30.960 --> 2:35:33.960]  This goes into how great he is and how much he loves the Bushes.
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:37.960]  I got to tell you, Roger, you have been 100% accurate and dead on like no other political
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:41.960]  analysts we've ever seen, unless because you were an insider in the last 10 years and turned
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:43.960]  against it when you realize it was a fraud.
[2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:45.960]  But tell us what's going to happen.
[2:35:45.960 --> 2:35:49.960]  Well, you were getting into Utah and the steel there, the other steels that are coming up
[2:35:49.960 --> 2:35:53.960]  and other big tidbits, because I'm going to have an article put out about this that we're
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:57.960]  going to put out tomorrow with this video just warning people that, hey, America, will you
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:35:59.960]  let them really steal the election?
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:02.960]  Because this is like suspending the election.
[2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:06.960]  I mean, if you appoint the people and ignore the popular vote, that's the same thing you
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:07.960]  do.
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:09.960]  That's the same thing as canceling it.
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:14.960]  You just have some synthetic facade going and the public's going to see right through
[2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:16.960]  that, Roger.
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:19.960]  Do you agree?
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:21.960]  Well, look, yes, Alex, I do.
[2:36:21.960 --> 2:36:23.960]  Let me clear one thing up.
[2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:30.960]  As you probably saw on Friday, Ted Cruz attacked me personally, viciously, claiming that I
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:33.960]  had planted an article in the National Enquirer.
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:34.960]  Let me be very clear.
[2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:38.960]  This article, which is very controversial, I'm quoted on the record.
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:44.960]  Why would I ever be quoted on the record in an article that's being planted as a dirty
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:45.960]  trick?
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:46.960]  Why would anyone do that?
[2:36:46.960 --> 2:36:50.960]  I understand the murky ways of the back alleys of American politics.
[2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:54.960]  This story did not come from the Trump camp, did not come from me.
[2:36:54.960 --> 2:36:58.960]  It's not a matter I've ever discussed with Donald Trump or his campaign.
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:03.960]  This story originated with private detectives working for Marco Rubio.
[2:37:03.960 --> 2:37:07.960]  Perhaps off the books, but working for Marco Rubio.
[2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:10.960]  Rubio uncovered these leads.
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:15.960]  He held them, I think, against a hedge regarding attacks on his own personal life.
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:19.960]  In the end, he didn't use this information because he never had to.
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:21.960]  He never got enough traction that it mattered.
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:26.960]  I think the PIs went out and sold this information and got a second payday.
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:30.960]  But to unfairly blame Donald Trump is a canard.
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:33.960]  Trump knows nothing about this, as he has said.
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:35.960]  Look, I'm the pex bad boy of American politics.
[2:37:35.960 --> 2:37:36.960]  I've been around.
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:37.960]  Let's blame stone.
[2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:38.960]  It's raining out.
[2:37:38.960 --> 2:37:41.960]  Well, by the way, let me just bring this up just to show how the dirty stuff works.
[2:37:41.960 --> 2:37:42.960]  He gets up to the speakers.
[2:37:42.960 --> 2:37:49.960]  Roger Stone, the henchman of Trump, the vicious evil monster who you worked for in the deal
[2:37:49.960 --> 2:37:50.960]  in Florida.
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:55.960]  Roger Stone, the day after these attacks on my wife, the day after it's in the inquire,
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:37:58.960]  the inquire admitted they've been working on it for six months.
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:00.960]  You learned about it a couple of months ago when they called you.
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:04.960]  You told me about it at dinner, but said, let's not go there because, you know, we're
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:06.960]  not going into personal stuff.
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:10.960]  You said, I will go into Rubio and his bubble baths with other guys and whatever, because
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:11.960]  that's, you know, interesting to the base.
[2:38:11.960 --> 2:38:13.960]  So you're out there about the big steal.
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:17.960]  They want this distraction about you attacking his wife or whatever.
[2:38:17.960 --> 2:38:19.960]  The truth is he was moved out for years.
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:20.960]  His daughters don't even like him.
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:22.960]  He's down here with all these women.
[2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:23.960]  It's well known.
[2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:27.960]  I mean, I even know people that have talked about Ted Cruz in Austin and I just ignored
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:28.960]  it.
[2:38:28.960 --> 2:38:31.960]  But reportedly he's quite the peppy of a pew.
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:32.960]  Yeah.
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:35.960]  Look, I, I, I really, I abhor this kind of thing.
[2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:36.960]  There's enough about Ted Cruz.
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:41.960]  It's troubling to beat him on the issues he and, and including his illegal loans, which
[2:38:41.960 --> 2:38:44.960]  he lied about from Wall Street, from Goldman Sachs and so on.
[2:38:44.960 --> 2:38:50.960]  I like Marco Rubio and I actually had a fear that others would exploit these vicious rumors
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:51.960]  about him.
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:53.960]  I really don't have any interest in that.
[2:38:53.960 --> 2:38:55.960]  This isn't, this is, uh, it's,
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:38:58.960]  Well, sure, you never brought in that up about it, but I mean, I mean, I mean, you just did
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:01.960]  say that, well, that might be more interesting, but yeah, you were, you were at dinner saying
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:03.960]  none of this is good to cover.
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:05.960]  No, because I think there are bigger issues.
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:10.960]  Look, just in the last couple of weeks, Ted Cruz has named the man as his chief economic
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:12.960]  advisor, former Senator Phil Graham.
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:14.960]  This is Dr. Doom.
[2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:16.960]  This is the guy who repealed Glass-Steagall.
[2:39:16.960 --> 2:39:20.960]  This is the guy who caused the bubble that destroyed our economy.
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:28.960]  Then he came back for a second, bite at the apple and his other re-entered legislation.
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:33.960]  This guy's already destroyed the, the, uh, the economy once.
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:36.960]  This is who Ted Cruz would put in charge.
[2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:38.960]  This is a Wall Street from Predator.
[2:39:38.960 --> 2:39:45.960]  Today, Phil Graham works for UBS and to help them hide offshore, uh, uh, millions from
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:46.960]  U.S. taxation.
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:53.960]  So, uh, whether it's Neil Bush, endorsing and becoming a part of Ted Cruz's finance
[2:39:53.960 --> 2:39:59.960]  committee, or whether it is Jeb Bush, uh, who is, uh, who is now reluctantly supporting
[2:39:59.960 --> 2:40:04.960]  a guy he doesn't even like personally, but who's globalist views that he, that he supports.
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:11.960]  Neil Bush, who defrauded American taxpayers out of $1.5 billion and now Phil Graham, this
[2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:13.960]  is quite a trio.
[2:40:13.960 --> 2:40:19.960]  Neil Kahn's, the people who have destroyed our economy through NAFTA and TPP and all
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:22.960]  other, all of their other globalist international trade pact.
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:27.960]  Uh, just look at who Donald Trump's opponents are and you understand you're on the side
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:28.960]  of the Patriot.
[2:40:28.960 --> 2:40:30.960]  You're on the side of history.
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:33.960]  I've got to say this, Roger.
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:37.960]  I, about six, eight months ago, started to pretty much say I think Trump's the guy because
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:42.960]  of him against globalism and the system attacking, but I was still in my mind hedging, you know,
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:45.960]  if he does stuff I don't like, I'll come out against him because I'm a person of integrity,
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:51.960]  but now watching the entire world arrayed and dictators and mass murderers and the lying
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:56.960]  and the hype and it colleges, you see the name Trump screaming, crying psychologist.
[2:40:56.960 --> 2:40:59.960]  This is like a middle patient movie.
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:05.960]  This is like a absurdist art film or something where everyone just runs around screaming and
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:10.960]  they're murdering pinatas of him and hanging him everywhere and he's white.
[2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:11.960]  He's white.
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:15.960]  I mean, it is just the craziest, bizarro world.
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:17.960]  Why are they so scared?
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:21.960]  I know that's that question a million times, but they are having a total conniption fit.
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:25.960]  And so all I care about now is I hate this establishment.
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:26.960]  They're frauds.
[2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:27.960]  They're funding ISIS.
[2:41:27.960 --> 2:41:28.960]  They're bankrupting our country.
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:29.960]  They're coming after our kids.
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:31.960]  They've sold our jobs overseas.
[2:41:31.960 --> 2:41:36.960]  So I see Trump now like a Patriot suicide bomber blowing them up.
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:41.960]  And when they crush him and steal it from him, that's going to be a bigger explosion.
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:42.960]  It's just going to be delayed.
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:47.960]  I mean, this is actually beautiful to see the hatred of the establishment, the waking up,
[2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:51.960]  the people not buying into mainstream BS.
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:58.960]  And even if they can somehow force the destruction of Trump, I mean, I'm sure this is a death blow
[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:01.960]  to the rhinos and the Democrats and the rest of them.
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:03.960]  This is amazing.
[2:42:03.960 --> 2:42:09.960]  Well, I think once again, they have a tremendous tendency to underestimate Trump, but let's
[2:42:09.960 --> 2:42:12.960]  recognize the two track program here.
[2:42:12.960 --> 2:42:14.960]  These people are ruthless.
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:15.960]  They're efficient.
[2:42:15.960 --> 2:42:20.960]  They have a leg up in the process.
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:22.960]  We don't have the cozy relief.
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:24.960]  Your skype's breaking up a minute.
[2:42:24.960 --> 2:42:25.960]  Just wait a second till it stabilizes.
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:29.960]  Roger, stay there for a minute.
[2:42:29.960 --> 2:42:31.960]  Your skype's, your skype's messing up.
[2:42:31.960 --> 2:42:33.960]  I don't want to be able to catch back up and work here.
[2:42:33.960 --> 2:42:35.960]  It was working fine, but it's breaking up now.
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:37.960]  Stonezone.com.
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:39.960]  He's also has a stop to steal website.
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:42:42.960]  This is the time to be maximally involved.
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:47.960]  And listen, even if they still steal it, we win because we'll be out there educating everyone.
[2:42:47.960 --> 2:42:49.960]  And the curtain is back.
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:51.960]  This is their boldest move.
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:52.960]  They think they own this country.
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:53.960]  They think they own the process.
[2:42:53.960 --> 2:42:55.960]  They're telling you your vote doesn't count.
[2:42:55.960 --> 2:42:57.960]  This is amazing.
[2:42:57.960 --> 2:43:08.960]  You can call 855-245-4634 to report fraud, shoot YouTube videos about it, write articles about it, call talk radio about it, get upset when they rob you.
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:15.960]  And when they, and when you vote for Trump and they steal your delegates, if they do, which has already happened in Louisiana and Texas, other areas, go ape.
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:16.960]  You've been robbed.
[2:43:16.960 --> 2:43:17.960]  Go to the election commission.
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:19.960]  Get upset.
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:21.960]  It's time to take action.
[2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:23.960]  Again, stop the steal.
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:25.960]  We'll put it back up on screen for folks.
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:33.960]  What's the full URL for that, Roger Stone?
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:35.960]  What's the full URL for stop the steal?
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:38.960]  I think we have a delay.
[2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:40.960]  Stop the steal.org.
[2:43:40.960 --> 2:43:41.960]  Stop the steal.org.
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:42.960]  Okay.
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:44.960]  Two minutes and then I know you got to go.
[2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:46.960]  What are other key tidbits for people?
[2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:48.960]  What else is going on?
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:56.960]  Well, I actually think what you've got now is the importance of these contests moving forward.
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:00.960]  Trump has got to make an all out push in Wisconsin.
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:02.960]  I spoke to him over the Easter holiday.
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:09.960]  I called him to wish him, he and his family, a very holy and blessed Easter.
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:14.960]  He got terrific news in the birth of his new grandson Theodore.
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:25.960]  I thought it was interesting that he evoked Theodore Roosevelt in his discussion with the New York Times as the last time he saw foreign policy agreed with.
[2:44:25.960 --> 2:44:40.960]  The entire text of his New York Times interview, which was covered worldwide, shows me that the CFR effort to try to infiltrate Trump and affect his thinking to try to move him to a globalist worldview has utterly failed.
[2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:43.960]  What you heard was pure unto adulterated Trumpism.
[2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:59.960]  Put America first, get our jobs back, reassert our fiscal sanity, balance the budget, cut our debt, rebuild our strength, and get a foreign policy which is coherent.
[2:44:59.960 --> 2:45:06.960]  A foreign policy in which every question that we face is measured by one precept.
[2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:10.960]  What's in the best interests of the United States of America?
[2:45:10.960 --> 2:45:12.960]  That's Trumpism.
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:19.960]  And that's why they're so scared because he's put money for decades into anti-globalist efforts into the stopping NAFTA and GATT.
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:21.960]  That's what he's told people.
[2:45:21.960 --> 2:45:22.960]  He goes, I'm sick of this.
[2:45:22.960 --> 2:45:24.960]  We can make better deals.
[2:45:24.960 --> 2:45:31.960]  Globalism was about selling America's wealth out so the globalists that sold us out could be kingpins in China and India and Mexico.
[2:45:31.960 --> 2:45:33.960]  They've now taken the country over.
[2:45:33.960 --> 2:45:34.960]  They've impoverished us.
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:41.960]  They've got their foot on our neck and they think we're done and they're just going to arrogantly waddle in and try to destroy Trump.
[2:45:41.960 --> 2:45:49.960]  They blame on all the trendies and the hype-driven morons that go around feeling good because the mainstream media got into such a mentally ill frenzy
[2:45:49.960 --> 2:45:53.960]  and they see a Trump sticker, they start crying and rolling around and psychologists have to come.
[2:45:53.960 --> 2:45:57.960]  And then the dean of the major universities is like, we're very scared.
[2:45:57.960 --> 2:45:58.960]  This is a threat.
[2:45:58.960 --> 2:45:59.960]  The word Trump is racism.
[2:45:59.960 --> 2:46:04.960]  I mean, talk about the Soviets and the Communist Chinese under Mao at the worst time.
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:08.960]  We're not this basket case gibbering middle patients.
[2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:10.960]  I've got to be honest, Roger Stone.
[2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:12.960]  I'm scared for young people and liberals.
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:14.960]  I mean, they're not liberals, man.
[2:46:14.960 --> 2:46:16.960]  They're in a freakazoid cult.
[2:46:16.960 --> 2:46:18.960]  Yeah, it's very, very strange.
[2:46:18.960 --> 2:46:24.960]  As you know, one of the precepts of this cult, of course, is that Hillary Clinton is the same, that she's an advocate for women.
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:30.960]  She was a marvelous secretary of state and she's doing really good charitable work at the Clinton Foundation.
[2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:35.960]  And if you believe any of that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I want to talk to you about.
[2:46:35.960 --> 2:46:41.960]  Well, all right, well, Roger, I know you've got the even bigger news for us on Wednesday and you've promised to come.
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:44.960]  And also, also share another article with us.
[2:46:44.960 --> 2:46:48.960]  But again, the articles you sent us, I appreciate it as exclusive, but please just send them out.
[2:46:48.960 --> 2:46:49.960]  Whoever wants to post them can post them.
[2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:51.960]  I don't want to be the only one that has these.
[2:46:51.960 --> 2:46:55.960]  I know the Daily Caller and also Breitbart Carrier Stories and want them and you're giving some to us.
[2:46:55.960 --> 2:46:56.960]  So I appreciate that.
[2:46:56.960 --> 2:47:01.960]  But this one you send out Wednesday so big, I hope you just send it to everybody and say, hey, this is like a syndicated column.
[2:47:01.960 --> 2:47:02.960]  Get this out.
[2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:09.960]  Everybody needs to go to infowars.com and prisonpunna.com and get the Walker Willendors Cruz in Wisconsin push.
[2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:15.960]  It's an important headline, but I think it should probably be changed to the Republicans are already stealing the nomination from Trump.
[2:47:15.960 --> 2:47:17.960]  The big steal has begun.
[2:47:17.960 --> 2:47:21.960]  But Roger, great job and thank you for your work defending this Republic.
[2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:27.960]  Certainly, this has got to be an exciting time for not just you but everybody else because this is historical.
[2:47:27.960 --> 2:47:33.960]  Well, I like the idea of the headline change and Alex, I look forward to talking to you on Wednesday.
[2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:35.960]  Sir, thank you very much, Roger Stone.
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:36.960]  Stonezone.com.
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:39.960]  You can find both as new bestselling books and infowarsstore.com.
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:46.960]  We're going to go to break here in just a few minutes, but this is a promo piece of your radio listeners go to infowars.com forward slash show.
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:53.960]  So you can actually see what the products at infowarslife.com have done for me like X2 and supermobile vitality alone.
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:59.960]  People were freaked out when I was in my parents' hot tub did a Facebook mentions and how skinny I'm getting.
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:01.960]  I mean, it's amazing.
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:03.960]  I mean, I've got a six pack now when I'm standing up straight.
[2:48:03.960 --> 2:48:06.960]  When I sit down, there's a little bit of roll of fat to have a big torso.
[2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:07.960]  I mean, it's amazing.
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:09.960]  You see that video on our Facebook page.
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:17.960]  In fact, I think I want to post at the front page of info wars right now, but we'll go out to break with this little promo piece on my transformation.
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:21.960]  Just getting a few things I was deficient in at infowarslife.com.
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:26.960]  Please take a moment to listen to what I'm about to break down very, very carefully.
[2:48:26.960 --> 2:48:34.960]  Because the information I'm about to lay out in just two minutes changed my life and changed the life of many, many people around me.
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:42.960]  I was a big sports enthusiast, but loved to eat like a pig when I was 10 years old up to about 22 or so.
[2:48:42.960 --> 2:48:48.960]  And I ran six miles every other day and lifted weights almost every day and had a great physique.
[2:48:48.960 --> 2:48:56.960]  Then I got into radio and television 21 years ago and got so busy in my work, I stopped working out and everything was okay for four or five years.
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:48:59.960]  But then suddenly I started putting on pounds every month.
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:05.960]  And in the next 10 years, I gained almost 100 pounds.
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:16.960]  Then about seven years ago, I began jogging, swimming long distances and lifting weights again, trying to lose weight and was only able to lose about 20 of the 98 pounds.
[2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:20.960]  I even changed my diet. I even increased the exercise. It didn't work.
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:28.960]  But as soon as I began to get the nutrients and compounds that I needed, my whole life changed.

[2:53:07.960 --> 2:53:15.960]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer. He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[2:53:15.960 --> 2:53:23.960]  I said, let me see. Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated price competitive companies we represent,
[2:53:23.960 --> 2:53:28.960]  and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.

[2:53:59.960 --> 2:54:15.960]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:21.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:54:21.960 --> 2:54:30.960]  It is so incredibly obvious. It is so totally crystal. The social engineering, the divide and conquer that's going on.
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:37.960]  Foreign multinationals don't pay taxes. Basically, they're above the law, diplomatic community. They're the new royalty.
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:49.960]  And they just go into every country and sector and play countries off against each other, religious groups, different, different colored people, white against black, whatever the case is, one tribe against another.
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:58.960]  And they just turn it all into that. And we're so tribal that we buy into it. I mean, it's like homeowners associations. You're new in the neighborhood.
[2:54:58.960 --> 2:55:08.960]  You don't send people fruit baskets. You don't go kiss their butt. They're going to start harassing you. I mean, it's just any half decent area is going to have a homeowners association.
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:19.960]  And I'm like, we got to send cars to everybody. We got to go to their parties at least some or, you know, every time I haven't done it. Trouble starts. Trouble starts.
[2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:27.960]  Oh, you put your trash cans in on time. Oh, your car was three cars parked across the street. They're on that park on this side, according to the association.
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:36.960]  You just go kiss the person's butt. They have the association. No more problems. I mean, that's just the same thing. It's like the country clubs.
[2:55:36.960 --> 2:55:45.960]  It's a bunch of people on average who just want to act powerful and be lords of some area. And that's what the colleges teach.
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:56:01.960]  These aggressive, crazy, abusive, nutty people. And I just look at this country. It is a mess and all these young people endorsing communism and socialism.
[2:56:01.960 --> 2:56:10.960]  Every day I see the articles. China official says Dalai Lama making a fool of Buddhism.
[2:56:10.960 --> 2:56:20.960]  They kill you if you're a Buddhist in China. But now they represent it. See, oh, you're a fool. You make a fool of your religion.
[2:56:20.960 --> 2:56:31.960]  How a Venezuelan opposition leader secretly communicates with solidarity and confinement for two years because he was leading in the election.
[2:56:31.960 --> 2:56:39.960]  And now they just, the communists just lock him up. And people always act like communism is so cool. They lock everybody up.
[2:56:39.960 --> 2:56:54.960]  I mean, let me tell you, on ESPN and on CNBC and MSNBC and a bunch of the channels, it was from different angles, different arrests, people go, leave our town, leave our town, down with the castros.
[2:56:54.960 --> 2:57:00.960]  And the reporters would laugh and stuff as people got beat up and drug away. And it's like they kind of get off on the states of my friend now.
[2:57:00.960 --> 2:57:11.960]  Hey, it just arrested people for me. I mean, you should have like said, hey, okay, leave our town, down with the castros. But obviously they've been told, don't talk about about Castro when you're there.
[2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:20.960]  What good training for our media. It's like the top of DrugsReport.com right now. We can put that on screen. Hillary and the Clintons warn Bernie on his tone.
[2:57:20.960 --> 2:57:27.960]  He has to sit there and not go after her because she's the mob boss. Clinton warns Bernie, change your tone.
[2:57:27.960 --> 2:57:52.960]  Think about that. And it goes on and on and on. And you have these cloistered, arrogant people like Paul Ryan and the rest of them that are just sitting up there waiting to be installed as the Republican nominee and then handed to Clinton.
[2:57:52.960 --> 2:58:05.960]  The arrogance of these people. Clinton's aid. Sanders needs to change tone if he wants New York debate.
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:24.960]  Of course, if Sanders tears into her, that's it for Hillary, he'll win. And he's not completely backing down. I mean, I got to say, I don't like Sanders policies and stuff, but he's representing populism from the left. He is anti-establishment to a great degree because he wants to move us into socialism too quickly.
[2:58:24.960 --> 2:58:35.960]  The Globals think that's dangerous. I'm going to come back on the other side, do five more minutes, then I'm handing the baton to Paul Joseph Watson, hosting from London. Many stations pick up the fourth hour, but if you want to find it or they don't, infowars.com.

[3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:15.960]  It has 4.7 stars with 577 reviews. You talk about natural clean energy. This isn't like an energy drink, folks. There's no hangover. It's just amazing. I give it to my children when they're tired or grumpy after school in the car. Boom. Amazing.
[3:01:15.960 --> 3:01:30.960]  infowarsleif.com and you're funding the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty. All right, I wanted to do this clip and go to Watson. Ben Carson comes out and just says, Obama is crazy for not decrying the attacks on each other, which he hasn't done.
[3:01:30.960 --> 3:01:48.960]  They won't let Christian refugees into the US. They literally block them. They are out to get Christians, folks. It is a diabolical plan when they're Central Asian, when they're Pakistani. They don't care. They just kill, kill, kill, kill. The Christians were there before the Muslims.
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:52.960]  But I forgot it's a religion of peace now. Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[3:01:52.960 --> 3:01:57.960]  Does it matter that much whether you put the word Christian in the attack or not?
[3:01:57.960 --> 3:02:14.960]  Yes, it matters tremendously. You know, that's the same pattern that was exhibited with some of the Christian attacks in the other parts of the Middle East. You know, this is craziness that we simply refuse to acknowledge it and allow it to continue to grow.
[3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:27.960]  And, you know, I can't really explain why our administration goes out of its way, not to include the fact that Christians are being persecuted. But of course, this has implications for our country, too, in the future.
[3:02:27.960 --> 3:02:35.960]  Absolutely. And unfortunately, attacks like this, you know, are being exported to Europe. We've seen a migrant crisis exploited by ISIS.
[3:02:35.960 --> 3:02:48.960]  Yes, and our elite helped set them up, helped open the conduit out of Syria into Turkey. They're bringing them in for a class of civilizations. We need to hold the political class responsible for treason and just put that narrative out there.
[3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:56.960]  We're not going to let you turn your jihadis loose on us and not have you get in trouble. You're going to be held accountable.
[3:02:56.960 --> 3:02:59.960]  Obama and the neocons and Merkel and all of them.
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:12.960]  Paul, tell us what's coming up after the break and then I want your brief comment on they're bringing the sleeper cells in. I think they're getting ready for some really giant attacks and they think we're so dumb, we won't connect it to the politicians that brought them in.
[3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:23.960]  Well, they did a poll of ISIS and they asked them what color do you want the Eiffel Tower to be next. And 50% of them said that they want it to be in the colors of Great Britain.
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:39.960]  So most of them want there to be an attack in the United Kingdom. There was a guy arrested about 15 minutes from where I live for a tweet for inciting racial hatred because he said he didn't support Muslim migration to the UK.
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:49.960]  They ransacked his house. They took his laptops. They arrested him. Now the charges have been dropped after it got all this publicity. He's suing the Metropolitan Police.
[3:03:49.960 --> 3:04:04.960]  They have people, British citizens being arrested for being critical of Islam. Meanwhile, they arrested the guy that just said on a tweet that he talked to a woman wearing a headdress about if she supported the attack in Europe last week and then he got arrested for it.
[3:04:04.960 --> 3:04:16.960]  No, that was, that's what I'm talking about. But he wasn't arrested for confronting or harassing the woman. He was arrested for racial incitement via social media. So it was his tweets. It wasn't even anything he did on the street.
[3:04:16.960 --> 3:04:25.960]  He should, under free speech, be able to say something racist, but it's a religion. And he didn't. He just said he brought it up to her. He talked to a God.
[3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:37.960]  Now under Islam, a woman is like, under that system has no rights. But, but if a, if a infidel Brett talks to a God, then she's a God. Sorry, go ahead.
[3:04:37.960 --> 3:04:48.960]  No, you've got people walking around the houses of parliament this previous summer with ISIS flags waving them around. The police stopped them briefly, talked to them and let them go on their way.
[3:04:48.960 --> 3:04:57.960]  Hey, hey, it's not racial incitement. That's a terror symbol. I catch somebody waving one of those around them. I'll punch them in the nose. Paul, you take over right now. That's threatening us.
[3:04:57.960 --> 3:05:13.960]  The FBI will soon interview Hillary Clinton over her private email server. Federal prosecutors investigating the likely mishandling of classified materials on Clinton's server are already setting up formal interviews with some of her closest aides, according to insiders, which indicates the FBI investigation is nearing its final phases.
[3:05:13.960 --> 3:05:31.960]  These interviews will take several weeks, according to the LA Times, meaning that the scandal will continue to play Clinton throughout her presidential run. Back in 2009, your diplomatic security officials had an issue with Clinton even using her blackberry device in a secure office, worried that foreign spies could hack it and transform the blackberry into a listening device.
[3:05:31.960 --> 3:05:46.960]  Little did they know that her blackberry was connected to her private, unsecured email server where she kept highly classified documents, including material labeled beyond top secret. Of course, security officials had no way of doing anything about it because they had no idea the server even existed.
[3:05:46.960 --> 3:06:06.960]  And that's the point. The server allowed Clinton to avoid releasing emails to the public as part of the Freedom of Information Act. This is Kit Daniels, and visit infowarst.com for more reports.
[3:06:06.960 --> 3:06:20.960]  Well, thank you, brother. It's because it also funds our operation. But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[3:06:20.960 --> 3:06:36.960]  Coming to the Supermail and the Super Female Vitality, big changes, a lot of energy, we've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[3:06:36.960 --> 3:06:50.960]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting, and I love it.
[3:06:50.960 --> 3:06:58.960]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your Supermail vitality and other powerful products from Info Wars Life.
[3:06:58.960 --> 3:07:10.960]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:29.960]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there were silent weapons for quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[3:07:29.960 --> 3:07:48.960]  We stop our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[3:07:48.960 --> 3:08:00.960]  That's why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[3:08:18.960 --> 3:08:40.960]  It is a big idea. A new world order. It was almost as if it were a planned implosion. It's just pancake.
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:58.960]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[3:08:58.960 --> 3:09:12.960]  But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:28.960]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:43.960]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:58.960]  We're going to play my video that I put out last week, the truth about the Brussels attacks here in a minute because it's still completely relevant as to what's happening with the aftermath of this attack, which has been received quite differently to the Paris massacre,
[3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:13.960]  obviously, and thankfully a lot less people died, but it's basically being forgotten about by many people in Europe. People have stopped talking about it. In fact, it disappeared from the Twitter trending hashtags even before we'd reached the next day,
[3:10:13.960 --> 3:10:28.960]  because this kind of terrorism is becoming the new normal in Europe because our response to it has been so weak and limp-wristed that we're just inviting more and more attacks. The hashtags after the Paris massacre,
[3:10:28.960 --> 3:10:48.960]  pray for Paris, the candles, the sympathy did absolutely nothing. Changing your Facebook photo to overlay it with an image of the French flag did absolutely nothing. It only invited more attacks because we're not getting to the root of what is causing these attacks,
[3:10:48.960 --> 3:11:00.960]  which is radical Islam, which is Islamists themselves who in many cases are supported by, quote, moderate Muslims. They need to be part of the conversation because they're part of the problem.
[3:11:00.960 --> 3:11:17.960]  In fact, I've shown video footage in the past where, for example, you have a conference in Norway where a prominent Islamist speaker gets up and decries the fact that the media says that moderate Muslims don't espouse views such as
[3:11:17.960 --> 3:11:28.960]  executing gays is acceptable, views such as stoning women to death. He gets up there, he asks the audience of 200 plus Muslims, black Muslims, Arabs, white Muslims,
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:38.960]  do you agree with these views that we should, you know, kill homosexuals, stone women to death, have honor killings, et cetera, et cetera. They all raise their hands.
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:49.960]  And he goes on to say, are you moderate Muslims? Yes, they all raise their hands. So this is the root problem that we need to address, that this is not a tiny fringe minority.
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:58.960]  And we're going to get onto that in a minute because Sky News did an interview with somebody who basically had his leg blown off in this Brussels attack.
[3:11:58.960 --> 3:12:08.960]  His name is Walter Benjamin. He's had his leg amputated since he was blown across Ceventem Airport by the two huge blasts that occurred last week.
[3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:17.960]  But Benjamin warned ordinary Muslims should not be held responsible hours after far-right protesters hijacked peace protests in the center of Brussels.
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:30.960]  He told RTL, quote, I hope people will be smart enough to understand that 99.99% of the Muslim population is extraordinary and does not get involved with extremism.
[3:12:30.960 --> 3:12:41.960]  20 or 30 people don't represent an entire community. So again, it's this rush immediately after the attacks, not to get to the root of what's causing these attacks,
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:51.960]  but to cry and whine about Islamophobia, to fear monger about Islamophobia attacks, which, to be honest, just aren't happening.
[3:12:51.960 --> 3:13:02.960]  If Europe was so Islamophobic, there would be waves of attacks against Muslims in the aftermath of events such as Paris, in the aftermath of events such as Brussels.
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:11.960]  There isn't. And in fact, if you drill down into the statistics of hate crimes, the clear majority of them are anti-Semitic.
[3:13:11.960 --> 3:13:19.960]  They've got nothing whatsoever to do with Islamophobia. But again, we hear this narrative that we must apologize, we must kowtow,
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:27.960]  we must only be concerned about political correctness and not actually getting to the root of this problem and stamping it out.
[3:13:27.960 --> 3:13:37.960]  Because we know that Abdeslam, there in Molenbeek, the jihadist ghetto, was protected by his friends and neighbors for months.
[3:13:37.960 --> 3:13:48.960]  Okay? They would probably describe themselves as moderate Muslims, but they were protecting somebody who was involved in the massacre of 200 people in Paris.
[3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:57.960]  So when you try and claim that it's only 0.001% of Muslims who are involved in this, it's simply incorrect.
[3:13:57.960 --> 3:14:06.960]  And we can look at the statistics throughout Europe. For example, this is peer research, Muslim support for suicide bombing.
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:12.960]  This is Muslims living in Europe. And quite frankly, I'm sick of talking about this.
[3:14:12.960 --> 3:14:20.960]  But I have to go over it again and again after every single one of these attacks, because we hear the same narrative over and over again,
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:27.960]  that this is just a tiny fringe minority. It has nothing to do with Islam, which is the religion of peace.
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:32.960]  I'm exasperated at this point. I'm sick of talking about it. I would rather talk about something else.
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:39.960]  But when Europe is being attacked over and over again, we have to talk about it. Otherwise, this is going to become the new normal.
[3:14:39.960 --> 3:14:46.960]  We're going to become like Pakistan, where they had a huge Islamist attack yesterday.
[3:14:46.960 --> 3:14:51.960]  Routinely, it happens there every couple of months. Massive attacks, killing dozens and dozens of people.
[3:14:51.960 --> 3:14:57.960]  I don't want to live on a continent or in a country that has that, that has to endure that.
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:03.960]  So we need to make the point again and again. This is not a tiny fringe radical minority.
[3:15:03.960 --> 3:15:09.960]  Yes, not all Muslims are terrorists, but many of them support terrorist acts, and that's a problem,
[3:15:09.960 --> 3:15:17.960]  because it leads to people like Abdeslam in Molenbeek being protected by his community.
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:23.960]  Muslim support for suicide bombing by country. This is Muslims who live in Europe.
[3:15:23.960 --> 3:15:30.960]  Not Muslims who live in the Middle East. The numbers are even higher over there, and I've covered that before in my videos.
[3:15:30.960 --> 3:15:42.960]  France. 35% of Muslims in France think that suicide bombing is always or sometimes justified.
[3:15:42.960 --> 3:15:46.960]  Now, I'm not making these stats up out of thin air. This is pure research.
[3:15:46.960 --> 3:15:51.960]  In fact, I posted the source on my Twitter back a few days ago. You can go and find it for yourself.
[3:15:51.960 --> 3:16:06.960]  35% of Muslims in France support suicide bombings under certain circumstances. 42% of young adults aged 18 to 29 in France support suicide bombings.
[3:16:06.960 --> 3:16:10.960]  Now, it's the highest in France. There are no stats for Belgium, but you would expect,
[3:16:10.960 --> 3:16:17.960]  given that Belgium has roughly the same Muslim population as France, around six, seven percent.
[3:16:17.960 --> 3:16:21.960]  Of course, Brussels itself is almost 25% Muslim now.
[3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:29.960]  You would expect that Belgium would have similar statistics in terms of the number of Muslims who support suicide bombings.
[3:16:29.960 --> 3:16:36.960]  Now, that's not a moderate belief, and 35% is not a tiny minority.
[3:16:36.960 --> 3:16:41.960]  Now, it's less in other European countries, but frankly, it's still shocking.
[3:16:41.960 --> 3:16:48.960]  Germany, 13% of all Muslims think that suicide bombings are always or sometimes justified.
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:54.960]  22% of young adults in Germany think the same. Then you can look at Great Britain.
[3:16:54.960 --> 3:17:01.960]  24% of Muslims think that suicide bombings are always or sometimes justified.
[3:17:01.960 --> 3:17:07.960]  Almost a quarter of the population of Muslims in Britain think this way.
[3:17:07.960 --> 3:17:17.960]  Spain, 25%, oh, by the way, in Britain, 35% of young adults think that suicide bombings are sometimes or always justified.
[3:17:17.960 --> 3:17:20.960]  That's not a moderate belief. That's not a tiny fringe minority.
[3:17:20.960 --> 3:17:26.960]  No money. I don't know how many more times I have to say it, but again, it's getting quite exasperating.
[3:17:26.960 --> 3:17:36.960]  Germany, and I guess this number's probably risen, given that they've imported 1.4 million predominantly Muslims into the country over the past year.
[3:17:36.960 --> 3:17:41.960]  13% of all Muslims think that suicide bombings are sometimes or always justified.
[3:17:41.960 --> 3:17:45.960]  22% of young adults think the same.
[3:17:45.960 --> 3:17:52.960]  And you can even go and look at the United States where it's 13% of all Muslims who think that suicide bombing is justified,
[3:17:52.960 --> 3:17:59.960]  and 26% of Muslims aged 18 to 29 who think the same.
[3:17:59.960 --> 3:18:12.960]  So when this guy who gets his leg blown off immediately bows down and has to emphasize that it's only a tiny 0.001% of Muslims who actually support this kind of extremism,
[3:18:12.960 --> 3:18:14.960]  it's simply incorrect.
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:18.960]  I've done several videos about the fact that Islam is not religion of peace.
[3:18:18.960 --> 3:18:21.960]  That doesn't mean that all Muslims are terrorists.
[3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:24.960]  That was never the debate in the first place.
[3:18:24.960 --> 3:18:31.960]  They try to frame the debate to make your views sound extreme and completely inaccurate.
[3:18:31.960 --> 3:18:39.960]  Nobody ever made the argument that all Muslims were terrorists, but we have to acknowledge that there are terrorists and there are Islamists.
[3:18:39.960 --> 3:18:43.960]  And Islamists, in many cases, support these suicide bombings.
[3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:47.960]  They act as a support network for actual terrorists.
[3:18:47.960 --> 3:18:54.960]  And they try to impose these beliefs when they emigrate to Western countries in terms of Sharia law,
[3:18:54.960 --> 3:19:01.960]  which again completely contradicts the very foundation of the legal system that we've created in the West.
[3:19:01.960 --> 3:19:07.960]  It's highly oppressive and patriarchal, but feminists and leftists don't give a damn, of course,
[3:19:07.960 --> 3:19:13.960]  because they're more concerned about appearing racist even though Islam isn't a race.
[3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:21.960]  So again, it's getting to the point where I'm completely exasperated even having to re-emphasize this again and again,
[3:19:21.960 --> 3:19:26.960]  but we have to do it otherwise events like Brussels are going to become the new normal.
[3:19:26.960 --> 3:19:30.960]  So now the latest on Brussels, and we'll get more into this after the break.
[3:19:30.960 --> 3:19:35.960]  They thought they had caught the terror suspect in the airport who was wearing the hat.
[3:19:35.960 --> 3:19:37.960]  It turns out that they've now released him.
[3:19:37.960 --> 3:19:40.960]  Looks like that's not the individual they were looking for,
[3:19:40.960 --> 3:19:47.960]  but this character is very interesting when you look at what he does in relation to the migrant crisis
[3:19:47.960 --> 3:19:51.960]  and how he's involved in radicalizing some of the people in these migrant camps.
[3:19:51.960 --> 3:20:20.960]  So we'll get into that and more on the Alex Jones show Fourth Hour Overdrive after the break. Stay tuned.

[3:20:57.960 --> 3:21:01.960]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego.
[3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:07.960]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head-to-head fitness tests.
[3:21:07.960 --> 3:21:09.960]  How is this even possible?
[3:21:09.960 --> 3:21:14.960]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated,
[3:21:14.960 --> 3:21:17.960]  fountain-of-youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:20.960]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers
[3:21:20.960 --> 3:21:25.960]  that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[3:21:25.960 --> 3:21:29.960]  Previously, this drink was only available to elite military units,
[3:21:29.960 --> 3:21:38.960]  but for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative friends.
[3:21:38.960 --> 3:21:42.960]  But you must act fast. Do the high demand from members of the Coast Guard.
[3:21:42.960 --> 3:21:44.960]  Our supply is extremely limited right now.

[3:22:27.960 --> 3:22:30.960]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[3:22:30.960 --> 3:22:33.960]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[3:22:33.960 --> 3:22:36.960]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[3:22:36.960 --> 3:22:41.960]  He was a doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it.
[3:22:41.960 --> 3:22:43.960]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[3:23:57.960 --> 3:24:19.960]  Is it getting better?
[3:24:19.960 --> 3:24:42.960]  Well, that doesn't really add up because we've got the stats, the polls by Pew Research out of major European countries like France,
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:51.960]  which show that it's not a tiny minority of Muslims who are extremists who support these kind of acts.
[3:24:51.960 --> 3:25:01.960]  And of course that translates into areas like Molenbeek because you've got huge criminal areas where they're not necessarily involved in terrorism,
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:07.960]  but they're involved in crimes which end up funding and in fact arming these terrorists.
[3:25:07.960 --> 3:25:12.960]  So for example in Molenbeek, the police there in Brussels before the Paris attack,
[3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:19.960]  and of course it emerged that several of the individuals involved in carrying out and plotting the Paris attack came from Molenbeek.
[3:25:19.960 --> 3:25:22.960]  That's where the plot was hatched.
[3:25:22.960 --> 3:25:30.960]  Before that, around a year before that, the police in Brussels gave a list of dozens of potential jihadists, Islamists and criminals,
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:39.960]  to the mayor there in Molenbeek and she basically said this is politically incorrect, this is Islamophobia, I can't go after these people, it's not my job.
[3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:42.960]  So they could have stopped that way in advance.
[3:25:42.960 --> 3:25:50.960]  It's not just intelligence failures at this point, it's the obsession in Europe with political correctness which is making us weak
[3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:59.960]  and not allowing these intelligence agencies to do their job to actually go after these jihadists, these Islamists in the first place.
[3:25:59.960 --> 3:26:07.960]  And it's a wider network than just a tiny minority who are going to commit terror attacks, it's the whole support mechanism behind that,
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:15.960]  which is why you can get a Kalashnikov on the streets of Molenbeek within a few hours for 400 euros,
[3:26:15.960 --> 3:26:19.960]  because the Islamist criminals support the terrorists.
[3:26:19.960 --> 3:26:29.960]  And again, how they help hide and protect Abdeslam for three months after the Paris massacre, he was mainly hiding out there in Molenbeek.
[3:26:29.960 --> 3:26:34.960]  You can't do that without a support network around you that protects you.
[3:26:34.960 --> 3:26:40.960]  Now, of course, eventually that broke because they did another raid in Paris of some other suspects,
[3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:45.960]  recovered some mobile phones, they were able to track down Abdeslam that way.
[3:26:45.960 --> 3:26:49.960]  But for three months, he was protected by the community.
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:27:01.960]  ISIS, in its own manifesto, says we will exploit the refugee crisis to create these ghetto, no-go areas which then the media says don't exist.
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:03.960]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[3:27:03.960 --> 3:27:10.960]  Even as two days ago in Stockholm, you have another area being burned to the ground, police cars being attacked.
[3:27:10.960 --> 3:27:16.960]  But again, it's all one giant conspiracy theory and to think otherwise would be Islamophobic.
[3:27:16.960 --> 3:27:20.960]  But again, it's not a tiny minority.
[3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:25.960]  Now Sky News is reporting police released Brussels terror suspect.
[3:27:25.960 --> 3:27:32.960]  The only suspect charged over last week's Brussels attack has been released due to lack of evidence Belgian prosecutors say.
[3:27:32.960 --> 3:27:41.960]  Faiqal Shafu, an independent journalist, was widely reported to be the third individual in CCTV footage of suspects at Brussels airport.
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:48.960]  So they thought they had caught this guy in the hat which you saw on the CCTV footage on Saturday.
[3:27:48.960 --> 3:27:54.960]  And they thought it was this journalist who turns out to be a migrants rights activist.
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:57.960]  Now today, mysteriously, they've released him.
[3:27:57.960 --> 3:28:03.960]  They haven't said that it's not the guy in the airport picture that was taken immediately before the Brussels attack.
[3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:05.960]  But they're just saying that they released him.
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:13.960]  Well, it turns out as Breitbart is reporting, Brussels bomber was migrant rights activist who lived next door to EU.
[3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:20.960]  Mr. Shafu was listed as working for a radio station for North African migrants in an article from 2005.
[3:28:20.960 --> 3:28:26.960]  He claimed to be a freelance journalist who took a special arrest in refugees.
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:38.960]  Last year, Brussels Mayor Yves Meur accused him of trying to recruit jihadists among asylum seekers and migrants living at a refugee centre at Maximilien Park near the northern rail station.
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:47.960]  According to Belgian paper Le Swar, Mr. Meur considered him to be dangerous and repeatedly tried without success to have him legally expelled from the centre.
[3:28:47.960 --> 3:28:51.960]  Finally, in September, the mayor issued a ban to keep him out of the park.
[3:28:51.960 --> 3:29:03.960]  So this is a guy, and now they're saying it might not be the guy in the airport photo that went to these refugee centres in Brussels and tried to radicalise these migrants to basically become jihadists.
[3:29:03.960 --> 3:29:09.960]  So it's interesting now that they've released him and whether he will be brought up on other charges.
[3:29:09.960 --> 3:29:15.960]  But again, that suggests that the guy in the photo is still at large.
[3:29:15.960 --> 3:29:30.960]  And undoubtedly, he's probably hiding in one of these jihadist ghettos that are dotted in and around Belgium and probably being supported by the criminal networks that keep those societies so close.
[3:29:30.960 --> 3:29:36.960]  Now, when we come back after the break, we're going to go to my video, The Truth About the Brussels Attack, for more background information about this.
[3:29:36.960 --> 3:30:02.960]  Today is Monday, March 28th, and here are some of the top stories from this past weekend and today.
[3:30:02.960 --> 3:30:07.960]  The Islamic State reportedly crucified a Catholic priest on Good Friday as part of its ongoing war against Christianity.
[3:30:07.960 --> 3:30:14.960]  Father Tom Hounza Dalil was kidnapped by ISIS gunmen while they attacked an old people's home in southern Yemen, killing at least 15 people on March 4th.
[3:30:14.960 --> 3:30:22.960]  Several religious groups had received threats that Father Thomas would be crucified on Good Friday, but this was denied by his church in his hometown of Bangalore.
[3:30:22.960 --> 3:30:29.960]  However, the Archbishop of Vienna told a congregation gathered in Saint Stephen's Cathedral in the Austrian capital that the priest had been crucified.
[3:30:29.960 --> 3:30:37.960]  It is not known how the Archbishop became aware of Father Thomas' alleged faith, but his confirmation of the crucifixion was reported in the Austrian media.
[3:30:37.960 --> 3:30:39.960]  Other details have not yet emerged.
[3:30:39.960 --> 3:30:46.960]  In other news, Japan's space agency has lost contact with the Steve Space Satellite, equipped with X-ray telescopes designed to study the secrets of space.
[3:30:46.960 --> 3:30:53.960]  The satellite is surrounded by five pieces of debris, which could be its own parts, and it's been bearing off course since Saturday, as reported by RT.
[3:30:53.960 --> 3:30:57.960]  For more news, visit infowars.com. This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[3:30:57.960 --> 3:31:04.960]  Uh, yeah, first of all, I want to say, secret 12-act two, SuperMail, BrainForce, Prostagart, SilverBullet.

[3:31:42.960 --> 3:31:46.960]  So, and I just free up everything, and I just went to Autoville.

[3:32:08.960 --> 3:32:14.960]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[3:32:14.960 --> 3:32:19.960]  I-9 is key, is paramount, and there's still so much new information coming out
[3:32:19.960 --> 3:32:21.960]  that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[3:32:21.960 --> 3:32:28.960]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals
[3:32:28.960 --> 3:32:30.960]  to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[3:32:30.960 --> 3:32:34.960]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[3:32:34.960 --> 3:32:37.960]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[3:32:37.960 --> 3:32:41.960]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield, Nation I-9,
[3:32:41.960 --> 3:32:46.960]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula,
[3:32:46.960 --> 3:32:49.960]  unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[3:32:49.960 --> 3:33:18.960]  It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.
[3:33:19.960 --> 3:33:23.960]  Well, back on the Alex Jones show, fourth hour overdrive on Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:23.960 --> 3:33:26.960]  Just an update on that shooting at the Capitol.
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:30.960]  This is associated at Press. Police officers shot at US Capitol Shooter Court.
[3:33:30.960 --> 3:33:35.960]  The US Capitol Police Officer was shot Monday at the Capitol Visitor Center complex,
[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:39.960]  and the shooter was taken into custody, Capitol officials and police said.
[3:33:39.960 --> 3:33:42.960]  So there was one cop that was shot, thankfully.
[3:33:42.960 --> 3:33:48.960]  He was not seriously injured, and that incident at the US Capitol has now ended.
[3:33:48.960 --> 3:33:50.960]  They've caught the shooter.
[3:33:50.960 --> 3:33:56.960]  Going back to Brussels, and we're going to play the truth about Brussels attacks video here in a moment.
[3:33:56.960 --> 3:34:01.960]  They're now reporting that the guy who was pictured in the CCTV footage there at the airport
[3:34:01.960 --> 3:34:05.960]  was not captured on Saturday. He remains at large.
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:09.960]  The individual that everybody thought that was, this guy called Shafu,
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:15.960]  was a migrants rights activist who tried to recruit and radicalize people
[3:34:15.960 --> 3:34:22.960]  there at the migrant center in Brussels, which you see this over and over again.
[3:34:22.960 --> 3:34:27.960]  But you see migrants arriving even before any of that happens, as we saw in Italy,
[3:34:27.960 --> 3:34:32.960]  with ISIS flags on their phone, with pictures, with videos of beheadings.
[3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:36.960]  So in many cases, these migrants are already radicalized.
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:43.960]  In other cases, these jihadists are infiltrating via the migrant wave to radicalize them.
[3:34:43.960 --> 3:34:48.960]  And that's a problem, but people who criticized that are now getting arrested
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:52.960]  simply for drawing attention to it. We're going to get into that in a moment.
[3:34:52.960 --> 3:34:59.960]  But for further background on what happened in Brussels, here is the truth about the Brussels attack.
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:07.960]  How many Europeans need to be slaughtered before we acknowledge that Islam is not a religion of peace?
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:13.960]  How many bloodstained bodies and limbs need to be strewn across airports and metro stations
[3:35:13.960 --> 3:35:17.960]  before we admit that Islam has a problem with violence?
[3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:23.960]  Putting a filter on your Facebook photo is not going to reduce terror.
[3:35:23.960 --> 3:35:28.960]  Starting a sympathetic hashtag on Twitter is not going to reduce terror.
[3:35:28.960 --> 3:35:33.960]  Creating a sappy cartoon is not going to reduce terror.
[3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:37.960]  Hugging a Muslim is not going to reduce terror.
[3:35:37.960 --> 3:35:42.960]  Calling someone an Islamophobe is not going to reduce terror.
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:49.960]  The only thing that will reduce terror is acknowledging and countering its root ideology.
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:56.960]  Islam. And just to remind you, Islam is a belief system, not a race.
[3:35:56.960 --> 3:36:02.960]  It's not racist to criticize a religion. This has nothing to do with Islam.
[3:36:02.960 --> 3:36:04.960]  They were lecturers once again.
[3:36:04.960 --> 3:36:10.960]  Yet in the past 30 days alone, there have been 23 Islamic attacks in 22 countries.
[3:36:10.960 --> 3:36:18.960]  1,018 people killed, 2,008 people injured, just in the last 30 days.
[3:36:18.960 --> 3:36:26.960]  But the usual suspects like George Galloway immediately tried to absolve Islam of blame by pointing to foreign policy.
[3:36:26.960 --> 3:36:31.960]  And yes, the West's policy in arming jihadists in Libya and Syria was a disaster.
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:37.960]  But Brussels suspended its bombing campaign against ISIS in Syria 8 months ago.
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:43.960]  Belgium hardly has a reputation for being a murderous invading empire.
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:50.960]  You're only blaming foreign policy, so you don't have to acknowledge that Islam has a violence problem.
[3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:57.960]  It's far more likely that this was a revenge attack for the capture of Paris massacre culprit, Salah Abdeslam,
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:06.960]  who by the way was able to hide in Brussels for four months because he was helped by the residents of Molenbeek,
[3:37:06.960 --> 3:37:15.960]  proving once again that terrorism has far more support amongst Muslims than the politically correct media will ever recognize.
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:25.960]  Residents of Molenbeek even rioted and attacked the police during Salah's arrest, calling the terrorist their hero.
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:32.960]  These terrorists emerge out of the same ghettos that leftists celebrate in the name of diversity.
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:38.960]  The same Muslim no-go areas that the media and politicians claim are a conspiracy theory,
[3:37:38.960 --> 3:37:42.960]  even as film crews are attacked every time they go near them.
[3:37:42.960 --> 3:37:43.960]  Hello, how are you?
[3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:49.960]  Liz Hayes and the 16-minute crew attacked.
[3:37:49.960 --> 3:37:53.960]  But who did some on the left blame for the Brussels attack?
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:56.960]  You guessed it, it's Donald Trump.
[3:37:56.960 --> 3:38:01.960]  Because he might have said mean things that offended the poor terrorists,
[3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:06.960]  even though Trump warned about Brussels and was criticized for it just two months ago,
[3:38:06.960 --> 3:38:10.960]  calling the Belgian capital a jihadist hellhole.
[3:38:10.960 --> 3:38:15.960]  There's something going on and it's not good where they want your real law, where they want this,
[3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:18.960]  where they want things that, you know, there has to be some assimilation.
[3:38:18.960 --> 3:38:20.960]  There is no assimilation.
[3:38:20.960 --> 3:38:25.960]  There's something bad going on and until we find out what it is so we can correct it,
[3:38:25.960 --> 3:38:26.960]  you go to Brussels.
[3:38:26.960 --> 3:38:29.960]  I was in Brussels a long time ago, 20 years ago.
[3:38:29.960 --> 3:38:31.960]  So beautiful, everything so beautiful.
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:34.960]  It's like living in a hellhole right now.
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:37.960]  You go to these different places, there's something going on.
[3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:41.960]  Foreign policy, Donald Trump, even climate change,
[3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:46.960]  the left will search for any excuse to avoid having to face the truth.
[3:38:46.960 --> 3:38:49.960]  Islam is not a religion of peace.
[3:38:49.960 --> 3:38:55.960]  How many times will violent Islamists have to prove this before anything changes?
[3:38:55.960 --> 3:38:57.960]  Islam needs a reformation.
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:39:02.960]  By immediately labeling anyone who makes this argument a racist or an Islamophobe,
[3:39:02.960 --> 3:39:05.960]  you're preventing that reformation.
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:08.960]  You're allowing extremists to dominate the conversation
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:12.960]  because smart and sensible people, including Muslim reformists,
[3:39:12.960 --> 3:39:15.960]  are being intimidated into silence.
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:23.960]  You're contributing to the deadly naivety that paved the way for Europe's open border madness.
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:29.960]  You're contributing to the absurd notion that mass unrestrained multiculturalism works.
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:30.960]  It doesn't work.
[3:39:30.960 --> 3:39:33.960]  Molenbeek proves it doesn't work.
[3:39:33.960 --> 3:39:37.960]  Today's attacks prove it doesn't work.
[3:39:37.960 --> 3:39:42.960]  How many more attacks in major European cities will we have to witness
[3:39:42.960 --> 3:39:46.960]  before we acknowledge that it doesn't work?
[3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:55.960]  That is the truth about Brussels, which has got over 625,000 views at this point.
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:39:58.960]  And it's not really that complex or nuanced.
[3:39:58.960 --> 3:40:02.960]  It's just pointing out the blindingly obvious that the media
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:06.960]  continually fails to tell people in the aftermath of these attacks.
[3:40:06.960 --> 3:40:10.960]  And now the fallout is this out of the London Telegraph.
[3:40:10.960 --> 3:40:14.960]  I confronted a Muslim tweet suspect says he will sue the Metropolitan Police
[3:40:14.960 --> 3:40:17.960]  after race, hate, charges are dropped.
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:20.960]  Now, this is the guy who lives in Croydon,
[3:40:20.960 --> 3:40:25.960]  which is about 15 minutes from where I live, just south of London.
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:30.960]  He basically tweeted about the fact that he confronted a Muslim woman in Croydon
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:34.960]  immediately after the Brussels attacks and asked her to explain Brussels.
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:37.960]  She said, quote, nothing to do with me.
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:39.960]  A mealy-mouthed reply.
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:45.960]  Now, of course, this guy's an idiot for going up to random Muslim women on the street
[3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:48.960]  and asking them to explain Brussels.
[3:40:48.960 --> 3:40:51.960]  Obviously, that's a very silly and stupid thing to do.
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:54.960]  But that's not what he was arrested for.
[3:40:54.960 --> 3:40:59.960]  He wasn't arrested for street harassment because indeed he didn't harass anybody.
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:04.960]  He was arrested for racial incitement via social media
[3:41:04.960 --> 3:41:08.960]  because after this tweet, he made a number of other tweets,
[3:41:08.960 --> 3:41:13.960]  one of which said, no more Muslim migration to the United Kingdom.
[3:41:13.960 --> 3:41:16.960]  So again, we've seen similar things in Holland,
[3:41:16.960 --> 3:41:21.960]  where people say that their town's refugee policy is, quote, a bad plan.
[3:41:21.960 --> 3:41:26.960]  They get a home visit from the police who tell them to stop tweeting.
[3:41:26.960 --> 3:41:28.960]  Well, in this case, it was even worse.
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:30.960]  This is a guy called Matthew Doyle.
[3:41:30.960 --> 3:41:33.960]  They arrested him for this tweet,
[3:41:33.960 --> 3:41:37.960]  for saying that he had confronted a Muslim woman on the street.
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:40.960]  He wasn't arrested for that. He was arrested for his tweet.
[3:41:40.960 --> 3:41:42.960]  He was arrested for other tweets which said,
[3:41:42.960 --> 3:41:45.960]  no more Muslim migration to the United Kingdom.
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:51.960]  And not only that, he says, quote, I cannot understand why I was detained.
[3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:53.960]  My flat was trashed.
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:57.960]  My passport seized in two PCs, two tablets, and my phone taken.
[3:41:57.960 --> 3:42:02.960]  So not only did they arrest him, they ransacked his apartment, took his computers,
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:05.960]  and of course, it was based on absolutely nothing.
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:09.960]  They can't arrest people for disagreeing with immigration policy.
[3:42:09.960 --> 3:42:13.960]  I mean, we're not quite that close to 1984 yet.
[3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:16.960]  But now he's suing them. They've admitted it was a wrongful arrest.
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:22.960]  And basically, the Metropolitan Police are going to have a big problem on their hands because of this.
[3:42:22.960 --> 3:42:24.960]  But again, why did it happen?
[3:42:24.960 --> 3:42:30.960]  Because the perpetually outraged morons on Twitter mass reported this guy.
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:35.960]  Again, it caught the wind of this viral trend of this public shame in culture
[3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:39.960]  where they all jump in like vultures and try to virtue signal,
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:45.960]  try to make themselves look good to their friends by pointing the finger at somebody else
[3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:49.960]  and saying, Islamophobe, you know, this is hate crime.
[3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:51.960]  And that's why he was targeted.
[3:42:51.960 --> 3:42:57.960]  Because this baying mob of professionally outraged idiots who now run Twitter
[3:42:57.960 --> 3:43:01.960]  like their own kangaroo court, pounced on his comments.
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:03.960]  And that's why he was arrested.
[3:43:03.960 --> 3:43:06.960]  It was a completely ridiculous and stupid arrest.
[3:43:06.960 --> 3:43:10.960]  And now the Metropolitan Police is going to get sued for it.
[3:43:10.960 --> 3:43:14.960]  But this is what happens when you give power to perpetually outraged morons
[3:43:14.960 --> 3:43:22.960]  and tell them all day long that criticism of Islam is racist when Islam isn't a race
[3:43:22.960 --> 3:43:29.960]  and that it's inciting racial hatred to disagree with your own government's immigration policy,
[3:43:29.960 --> 3:43:34.960]  which in the UK is 300,000 new immigrants.
[3:43:34.960 --> 3:43:35.960]  That's net.
[3:43:35.960 --> 3:43:41.960]  That's after people have left 300,000 new immigrants every single year,
[3:43:41.960 --> 3:43:47.960]  which again is going to create these jihadist ghettos like we now see popping up in Belgium.
[3:43:47.960 --> 3:43:50.960]  This guy was arrested for a tweet.
[3:43:50.960 --> 3:43:57.960]  Yet you had a guy back in the summer who was walking around right underneath the houses of parliament,
[3:43:57.960 --> 3:44:02.960]  parading ISIS flags right outside Big Ben.
[3:44:02.960 --> 3:44:04.960]  The police came up to him.
[3:44:04.960 --> 3:44:06.960]  They briefly chatted to him.
[3:44:06.960 --> 3:44:08.960]  They let him go on his way.
[3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:12.960]  So you're going to get arrested for making tweets critical of Islam.
[3:44:12.960 --> 3:44:16.960]  But feel free to wave ISIS flags around parliament.
[3:44:16.960 --> 3:44:17.960]  That's perfectly fine.
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:19.960]  Of course, the difference is this guy was a Muslim.
[3:44:19.960 --> 3:44:27.960]  Perhaps, as we saw in Rotherham, they were afraid to even take him in over fears of being politically incorrect.
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:35.960]  Remember in Rotherham, for over 13 years you had dozens and dozens of children being abused by Muslim rape gangs
[3:44:35.960 --> 3:44:42.960]  and the local council did absolutely nothing about it because they were concerned that if they took action,
[3:44:42.960 --> 3:44:45.960]  they could be seen as racist.
[3:44:45.960 --> 3:44:49.960]  So you've got people arrested for tweets in the United Kingdom,
[3:44:49.960 --> 3:44:53.960]  but parading an ISIS flag around the houses of parliament, that's just fine.
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:58.960]  You had no borders activists immediately after this Brussels attack.
[3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:02.960]  And in this case, one individual who lived in the United Kingdom,
[3:45:02.960 --> 3:45:07.960]  making a Facebook post saying that the Brussels attack was a good thing
[3:45:07.960 --> 3:45:14.960]  because it would allow migrants to exploit the crisis and get into the United Kingdom easier.
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:21.960]  So on the one hand, they're advocating criminality by allowing these migrants to illegally enter the United Kingdom.
[3:45:21.960 --> 3:45:26.960]  And on the other hand, by saying that Brussels was a good thing, they're glorifying terrorism.
[3:45:26.960 --> 3:45:34.960]  Two clear crimes, yet did anything happen to this no borders, open borders activists
[3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:38.960]  who posted this on Facebook again, a United Kingdom resident.
[3:45:38.960 --> 3:45:47.960]  Nothing whatsoever happened to her, yet a guy who criticizes the UK's immigration policy is arrested.
[3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:49.960]  His apartment is ransacked.
[3:45:49.960 --> 3:45:58.960]  And he's roundly denounced as a thought criminal by the baying social justice mob on Twitter.
[3:45:58.960 --> 3:46:00.960]  That's the difference.
[3:46:00.960 --> 3:46:03.960]  So even though we've got ISIS in this online poll,
[3:46:03.960 --> 3:46:09.960]  asking what will the next color be on the Eiffel Tower as in who's going to get attacked next,
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:13.960]  50% of them want the United Kingdom to be attacked.
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:14.960]  They're not worried about that.
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:19.960]  They're worried about a guy in Croydon who is making tweets about immigration.
[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:21.960]  And that's why we're so weak.
[3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:28.960]  That's why we're opening the door, lowering the drawbridge for the next attack to happen.
[3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:35.960]  And let's not forget that in many cases, the victims of these Islamists are the Muslims.
[3:46:35.960 --> 3:46:37.960]  Again, we stick in the United Kingdom.
[3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:39.960]  Here's another story out of the Daily Mail.
[3:46:39.960 --> 3:46:42.960]  Was shopkeepers killer an Uber driver?
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:48.960]  Police investigated murder of Muslim man who had posted a happy Easter message sees car.
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:59.960]  So this was a Muslim shopkeeper again in this case, Glasgow in Scotland, who wished his friends and customers a happy Easter.
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:02.960]  He was trying to be tolerant of other religions.
[3:47:02.960 --> 3:47:04.960]  He was trying to be peaceful.
[3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:06.960]  For that, he was killed.
[3:47:06.960 --> 3:47:11.960]  Again, all evidence points to the fact that he was killed by another Muslim.
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:13.960]  So we've got that happening.
[3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:21.960]  So again, Muslims are, in many cases, the victims of these Islamists, which were not allowed to criticise, otherwise will be arrested.
[3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:30.960]  Again, you've got no borders activists saying that they should exploit the Brussels attack to break the law to cross over into the border of the United Kingdom.
[3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:41.960]  And in the same breath, glorifying terrorism, nothing happens to them, but this guy in Croydon is arrested for a tweet.
[3:47:41.960 --> 3:47:48.960]  This gets right to the heart of what's wrong with this reaction every time there's a massive ISIS attack in Europe.
[3:47:48.960 --> 3:47:51.960]  It's always about the concern for Islamophobia.
[3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:53.960]  People are being arrested for tweets.
[3:47:53.960 --> 3:47:59.960]  It's never about getting to the root cause of why these attacks are being allowed to happen.
[3:47:59.960 --> 3:48:11.960]  And in many cases that's because they've bragged, the Paris mastermind bragged that he exploited the refugee crisis to slip into Europe to plan that attack.
[3:48:11.960 --> 3:48:15.960]  But don't you dare say that on social media, otherwise you may be subject to arrest.
[3:48:15.960 --> 3:48:18.960]  And it's happening throughout Europe now.
[3:48:18.960 --> 3:48:25.960]  It's happening on Facebook where Merkel has teamed up with Zuckerberg to hunt down anti-migrant posts.
[3:48:25.960 --> 3:48:32.960]  If you actually dig into what some people were harassed for by the police, it's completely legitimate criticism.
[3:48:32.960 --> 3:48:36.960]  It's not racist. It's not hateful in any way.
[3:48:36.960 --> 3:48:41.960]  It's simply saying that they think there are too many refugees being brought into Europe that it's a bad plan.
[3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:43.960]  They get home visits from the police.
[3:48:43.960 --> 3:48:46.960]  This is the tyranny we now see unfolding.
[3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:56.960]  And this is out of Gateway Pundit remaining on subject of Brussels. Angry Muslims start screaming Palestine in middle of Brussels Memorial.
[3:48:56.960 --> 3:48:59.960]  We've got a video of this which is coming up in a second.
[3:48:59.960 --> 3:49:03.960]  So basically you've got the memorial there in the center of Brussels.
[3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:05.960]  This again is days after the attack.
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:12.960]  This angry guy gets up in front of the other people and starts for no reason whatsoever screaming Palestine.
[3:49:12.960 --> 3:49:14.960]  Let's go to this video.
[3:49:14.960 --> 3:49:16.960]  Palestine!
[3:49:16.960 --> 3:49:18.960]  Palestine!
[3:49:18.960 --> 3:49:20.960]  Palestine!
[3:49:20.960 --> 3:49:22.960]  Palestine!
[3:49:30.960 --> 3:49:36.960]  And there were other videos as well which show female Muslims, male Muslims removing an Israeli flag,
[3:49:36.960 --> 3:49:40.960]  in one case ripping it up, in another case placing a Palestinian flag over it.
[3:49:40.960 --> 3:49:43.960]  It's got nothing to do with Israel or Palestine.
[3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:51.960]  You're an innocent tourist in Brussels Metro or in the Brussels airport getting your legs blown off while you're trying to go on vacation.
[3:49:51.960 --> 3:49:54.960]  What the hell has that got to do with Palestine?
[3:49:54.960 --> 3:49:57.960]  So again, desecrating the memorial.
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:02.960]  And yet we still think that it's just a tiny minority of people who are the problem.
[3:50:02.960 --> 3:50:03.960]  It's not.
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:10.960]  So far this year, 96 terrorist attacks throughout the world since January.
[3:50:10.960 --> 3:50:13.960]  You go down the list of perpetrators and motives.
[3:50:13.960 --> 3:50:16.960]  Not a lot of Catholic suicide bombers.
[3:50:16.960 --> 3:50:21.960]  Not a lot of buss, massacring people outside of cafes.
[3:50:21.960 --> 3:50:22.960]  Okay?
[3:50:22.960 --> 3:50:26.960]  Islam is not a religion of peace and we need to point that out.
[3:50:26.960 --> 3:50:34.960]  We need to understand the fact that moderates, so-called moderates, are part of the problem because in many cases they're not moderates.
[3:50:34.960 --> 3:50:35.960]  They're not nominal Muslims.
[3:50:35.960 --> 3:50:46.960]  They're Islamists who support these kind of actions and until we recognize that, until we support the Muslim reformists who are trying to draw attention to this, like Majid Nawaz,
[3:50:46.960 --> 3:50:53.960]  and not intimidate them and shout them down and call them bigots, then we're going to continue to see horrors like we saw in Brussels.
[3:50:53.960 --> 3:50:56.960]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show final segment after the break.
[3:50:56.960 --> 3:50:57.960]  Stay right there.
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:07.960]  My name is Don Wiskin and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[3:51:07.960 --> 3:51:08.960]  What did I do?
[3:51:08.960 --> 3:51:16.960]  I created Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[3:51:16.960 --> 3:51:25.960]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:30.960]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[3:51:30.960 --> 3:51:34.960]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.

[3:51:40.960 --> 3:51:46.960]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[3:51:46.960 --> 3:51:51.960]  Extendivite is only $69.95 for a two month supply of either capsules or liquid.

[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:26.960]  Extend your life with Extendivite.
[3:52:51.960 --> 3:53:05.960]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[3:53:05.960 --> 3:53:10.960]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[3:53:10.960 --> 3:53:20.960]  Supernatural silver is a revolutionary broad spectrum antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[3:53:20.960 --> 3:53:29.960]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers using a patented technology that is highly effective against
[3:53:29.960 --> 3:53:34.960]  coals, flus, infections, food poisoning and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.

[3:54:36.960 --> 3:54:40.960]  In fact, I took some of this about 10 minutes before doing this show.
[3:54:40.960 --> 3:54:47.960]  It really helps with clarity with speaking. It energizes the cognitive functioning of the brain.
[3:54:47.960 --> 3:54:51.960]  Not easy to talk for an hour, but this definitely helps me.
[3:54:51.960 --> 3:55:04.960]  And of course, it all goes to support our operation, to support putting out independent reporters in the field to challenge the mainstream media narrative just as we did with the Paris Massacre.

[3:55:14.960 --> 3:55:16.960]  So please go there today.
[3:55:16.960 --> 3:55:21.960]  I'm just going to hit on a final few news stories here in the last three minutes of the show.
[3:55:21.960 --> 3:55:35.960]  Pope's Easter message condemns those who prevent migrants from crossing borders. So again, the social justice warrior Pope, who earlier this month admitted that the migrant crisis was a quote, Arab invasion,
[3:55:35.960 --> 3:55:46.960]  now says that anyone who condemns inviting millions and millions of people who don't assimilate into our culture, who expect us to change our morals, our laws for them.
[3:55:46.960 --> 3:55:53.960]  He says that we're hateful bigots. Basically, use weapons of love to fight evil of terrorism, Pope says on Easter.
[3:55:53.960 --> 3:56:02.960]  I'm sure ISIS is collectively crapping his pants at weapons of love being used to fight them indeed.
[3:56:02.960 --> 3:56:08.960]  Again, the social justice warrior Pope, but Obama reiterates refugee promise.
[3:56:08.960 --> 3:56:18.960]  This is the Washington Examiner. In a brief Easter weekend radio address, Obama vowed to decimate the self-proclaimed Islamic State by offending them and saying they're weak.
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:21.960]  That's what he said in his previous press conference.
[3:56:21.960 --> 3:56:26.960]  But now he says the United States will do so by offering an example of freedom, tolerance and open society.
[3:56:26.960 --> 3:56:38.960]  So he's going to fight ISIS by lowering the drawbridge even further for ISIS to infiltrate their jihadists. Yeah, that sounds like it's going to work great.
[3:56:38.960 --> 3:56:42.960]  The Mirror reports German train operator introduces women only carriages.
[3:56:42.960 --> 3:56:45.960]  The myth is over migrant sex attacks.
[3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:55.960]  Of course, the police in Germany have been told not to talk about those sex attacks because it could cause riots and civil unrest because they're so plentiful.
[3:56:55.960 --> 3:57:00.960]  Now they're talking about segregated carriages on trains again.
[3:57:00.960 --> 3:57:04.960]  Another example, they don't assimilate to our culture.
[3:57:04.960 --> 3:57:10.960]  We're forced to change our rules, our regulations, our morals to conform to them.
[3:57:10.960 --> 3:57:14.960]  That's not how immigration is supposed to work.
[3:57:14.960 --> 3:57:20.960]  Reuters reports Germany wants refugees to integrate or lose residency rights.
[3:57:20.960 --> 3:57:26.960]  Sounds good when you read the headline, but then you realize they give them three years to learn the language.
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:33.960]  And in most cases anyway, most of these refugees just disappear into the underground economy anyway.
[3:57:33.960 --> 3:57:38.960]  So it's not as if they've got tight controls, tight tabs as if they're tracking everywhere they go.
[3:57:38.960 --> 3:57:44.960]  A lot of them don't even attempt to assimilate. They immediately disappear into the underground economy.
[3:57:44.960 --> 3:57:51.960]  And again, the sheer pace of this makes it impossible to assimilate them. That's why many European governments now are...
[3:57:51.960 --> 3:57:57.960]  They've given up trying to educate migrants that it's not acceptable to molest and rape women.
[3:57:57.960 --> 3:58:00.960]  Now they're just in Germany handing out free condoms.
[3:58:00.960 --> 3:58:05.960]  The Washington Times reports Danish teen faces fines for using pepper spray on sex attacker.
[3:58:05.960 --> 3:58:08.960]  Again, yet another migrant attack.
[3:58:08.960 --> 3:58:15.960]  God forbid you would use self-defense and pepper spray. Remember the Finnish government came out with this ridiculous video
[3:58:15.960 --> 3:58:20.960]  saying that women should use the force to repel potential rapists.
[3:58:20.960 --> 3:58:24.960]  Now they're saying in Denmark that pepper spray is out of the equation.
[3:58:24.960 --> 3:58:29.960]  Student president freaks out over Trump 2016 written on whiteboard. That's the story up on infowars.com.
[3:58:29.960 --> 3:58:31.960]  That's going to do it for the show.
[3:58:31.960 --> 3:58:38.960]  Thanks for joining us, breaking news, infowars.com.
