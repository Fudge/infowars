[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.480 --> 00:20.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:20.040 --> 00:45.800]  Texas Alex Jones good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you
[00:45.800 --> 00:51.640]  may be listening Alex Jones here live we're gonna be here for the next three
[00:51.640 --> 01:01.280]  hours on this now third live broadcast of 2011 it is January 4th 2011 and again
[01:01.280 --> 01:05.400]  we're gonna be live here for the next 30 minutes we've got Wayne Madsen coming
[01:05.400 --> 01:09.920]  up in about an hour and a half popping in formally with the NSA writes on
[01:09.920 --> 01:13.360]  national security matters for some of the most prestigious publications in
[01:13.360 --> 01:18.160]  the country and just amazing predictions and piercing analysis he's
[01:18.160 --> 01:24.000]  saying that there's clear evidence of these rash of intensifying bombings
[01:24.000 --> 01:31.280]  across Europe being brought in as a political smokescreen for the austerity
[01:31.280 --> 01:35.320]  measures that the large central banks are putting in place to further loot the
[01:35.320 --> 01:40.560]  population there's clear evidence that it's connected to Operation Gladio that's
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.540]  been partially declassified and former Italian presidents German former
[01:45.540 --> 01:50.080]  defense ministers and others have gone public detailing them the 60s 70s and
[01:50.080 --> 01:56.400]  80s elements of NATO and the US military staged literally hundreds of
[01:56.400 --> 02:00.000]  bombings all across Europe to blame it on their political enemies of a right
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.320]  wing group was getting too popular that the establishment didn't like they'd
[02:03.320 --> 02:06.560]  stage a bombing if a left-wing group was getting too popular and was seen as
[02:06.560 --> 02:10.240]  anti-establishment they would stage a bombing and blame it on them one of
[02:10.240 --> 02:15.160]  the more famous 1980 Bologna bombing that killed a whole bunch of people
[02:15.160 --> 02:20.240]  including men women and children at that train station so Madsen will be popping
[02:20.240 --> 02:23.920]  in for about 20 minutes at the bottom of the next hour we were gonna have him on
[02:23.920 --> 02:27.640]  Friday but we had phone system problems on New Year's I guess with the phone
[02:27.640 --> 02:33.640]  systems jammed over in Paris but Max Kaiser will be joining us talk about the
[02:33.640 --> 02:39.360]  economy and his outlook going into 2011 and beyond always interesting and
[02:39.360 --> 02:45.400]  informative Max Kaiser will be joining us coming up in the last hour today now
[02:45.400 --> 02:49.680]  that said I've got to control myself and not run down a rabbit trail and we'll
[02:49.680 --> 02:55.160]  see if I can do it when we come back from break because we've got a lot of
[02:55.160 --> 03:00.920]  and very important geopolitical military news with Afghanistan Iraq you name it
[03:00.920 --> 03:09.680]  big developments with the bird die-off that story has now gone massive and we're
[03:09.680 --> 03:14.200]  right at the forefront of it the Daily Mail the Huffington Post reporting on
[03:14.200 --> 03:19.160]  our coverage that the drudger drudge report calm kicked into high gear
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.680]  yesterday when he linked to it you know is secret government testing linked to
[03:23.680 --> 03:28.280]  the birds dying at first it was a thousand then two thousand and four
[03:28.280 --> 03:31.920]  thousand now five thousand first it was less than a mile than a mile than a
[03:31.920 --> 03:37.160]  mile and a half than two mile area now a similar species or these same species of
[03:37.160 --> 03:45.640]  cedar wax wing blackbird falling dead in Louisiana in mass just 500 counted off
[03:45.640 --> 03:49.440]  of one road alone and other reports coming out around Louisiana and other
[03:49.440 --> 03:57.320]  parts of the south and the Midwest they've had the veterinary head of the
[03:57.320 --> 04:00.920]  fish and wildlife group there in Arkansas that did autopsy on the birds
[04:00.920 --> 04:05.760]  saying that there was not disease that did this show now now now maybe we got
[04:05.760 --> 04:10.160]  blackbirds that are dead in another state and maybe it was disease on that
[04:10.160 --> 04:13.600]  front because that's pretty common for birds to get sick and thousands can die
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.240]  but they don't all just drop out of the sky and dead before they hit the ground
[04:17.240 --> 04:21.680]  you know one dies here one dies there a few fall over here a few fall over there
[04:21.680 --> 04:26.640]  they die slowly we've all seen dead birds dead blackbirds especially because
[04:26.640 --> 04:29.840]  they overpopulate and tend to call themselves through starvation and
[04:29.840 --> 04:36.840]  disease the very prodigious species but clearly something else is going on here
[04:36.840 --> 04:42.640]  their organs were liquefied and it wasn't done by bacteria or a virus or
[04:42.640 --> 04:49.760]  other type of microbial infection so we're gonna be breaking that down also
[04:49.760 --> 04:55.240]  big news on the political front with the corruption of the Obama crime machine I
[04:55.240 --> 04:59.320]  want to hit that first when we come back from this quick break with big

[07:55.840 --> 08:06.120]  number 1-800-409-5633 from his central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy
[08:06.120 --> 08:14.320]  lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:15.680 --> 08:22.200]  this intriguing mystery of the five thousand dead blackbirds in Arkansas in
[08:22.200 --> 08:28.720]  BB Arkansas now in mass die-offs of the same species of blackbird in Louisiana
[08:28.720 --> 08:33.360]  and other areas of the United States the fact that the Fish and Wildlife
[08:33.360 --> 08:37.120]  Department veterinarians that have looked at it have told CNN that it was
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.080]  trauma that it was not disease well then if you have other birds that start
[08:41.080 --> 08:45.600]  dying and that's trauma something's going on here and colliding with each other
[08:45.600 --> 08:53.080]  in the night is not going to liquefy the innards of five thousand birds and we've
[08:53.080 --> 08:55.920]  got a lot of other bizarre things happening like this big fish die-off
[08:55.920 --> 09:00.520]  there may be naturally occurring reasons for this but I haven't figured out
[09:00.520 --> 09:04.000]  what they are yet and I know that when the government test chemical
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.320]  biologicals radiologicals birds are some of the most susceptible to it
[09:09.320 --> 09:14.400]  hence the famous canary in the coal mine there's a many other examples reported
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.600]  on by the press that when somebody first cooks on a no stick pan that the
[09:18.600 --> 09:23.240]  chemicals that are in it off gas and then if you have a bird and a cage in the
[09:23.240 --> 09:29.320]  room like a canary it will or a parakeet it will fall over dead we're going to be
[09:29.320 --> 09:35.560]  looking at that also Lindsey Graham calls for permanent US military presence
[09:35.560 --> 09:42.280]  in Afghanistan yesterday well that's the way it's always been that's the way you
[09:42.280 --> 09:49.080]  know the the real battle plan was and is and will always be to permanently stay
[09:49.080 --> 09:53.120]  there does the Empire leave Germany does the Empire leave Japan does the Empire
[09:53.120 --> 09:57.920]  leave South Korea does the Empire leave Guantanamo Bay it's not our Empire we
[09:57.920 --> 10:03.920]  just pay for it and we are an Empire clearly in decline and whereas I'd like
[10:03.920 --> 10:08.560]  to see the Empire fall I'd like to save the Republic you know the Empire killed
[10:08.560 --> 10:12.640]  the Republic the question is when the Empire falls will it implode in on us
[10:12.640 --> 10:18.120]  and feed on us even more domestically or could we pull a rabbit out of a hat and
[10:18.120 --> 10:24.000]  get our Republic back you know that's the big 64 million dollar question and
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.560]  that's just some of what is coming up today I'm now going to rip off David
[10:30.560 --> 10:34.720]  Letterman from last night I didn't see it but Karen told me about it and I guess
[10:34.720 --> 10:38.480]  it's not stealing the joke because I'm just repeating in here but he said that
[10:38.480 --> 10:43.560]  you know the new governor Mr. Brown has been sworn in in a particularly hokey
[10:43.560 --> 10:48.640]  way and that don't worry about Governor Schwarzenegger he's being relocated to a
[10:48.640 --> 10:53.680]  primate facility in Florida so he's gonna be quite happy but Schwarzenegger
[10:53.680 --> 10:58.880]  says he will be back and he wants the 22nd Amendment removed so he can be our
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.360]  president I think if you tell Rolling Stone and a film crew and several other
[11:04.360 --> 11:10.120]  newspapers that you admire Hitler and want to be a dictator that precludes you
[11:10.120 --> 11:17.880]  from public office clear abuse of power when you in the 90s tell MSNBC that you
[11:17.880 --> 11:26.000]  admire Kirk Voltaim the SS officer I think that precludes you so thank heavens
[11:26.000 --> 11:33.440]  for the vision of the founders and and the Constitution that we can't have a
[11:33.440 --> 11:38.320]  foreign-born individual as our El Presidente I don't know of any other
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.160]  countries that allow that as well it's just just common sense but really that
[11:42.160 --> 11:50.360]  had its genesis in the 1770s and 1780s because of practices in Europe where
[11:50.360 --> 11:57.280]  royalty would try to as young boys ship their sons into neighboring countries
[11:57.280 --> 12:01.200]  that were that were becoming democratic with parliaments and having them
[12:01.200 --> 12:05.280]  elected with their money power and backing to then take over the nation
[12:05.280 --> 12:11.480]  through that system and so we don't we don't need Arnold Aloes Schwarzenegger
[12:11.480 --> 12:18.080]  the anti-gun pro open border carbon taxing new world order person to run
[12:18.080 --> 12:24.800]  for office anymore we need to have Arnold go back to his homeland Austria is a
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.320]  beautiful wonderful country great people but I would be if I was Austrian I'd be
[12:29.320 --> 12:33.840]  irritated by say somebody from Texas over there talking about how I wanted to
[12:33.840 --> 12:38.000]  be a dictator and telling folks to turn their guns into me and that I wanted
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.880]  carbon taxes and he is leaving with a 22% approval rating so all the King's
[12:43.880 --> 12:48.280]  horses all the King's men aren't gonna be able to put Arnold Schwarzenegger back
[12:48.280 --> 12:53.040]  together again and I hope that part of that overall awakening is the fact that
[12:53.040 --> 13:00.600]  when I launched Americans against Arnold the Arnold expose.com that side even
[13:00.600 --> 13:03.840]  activity more always try to keep it up but we never look at it let's go to
[13:03.840 --> 13:07.840]  Arnold expose.com put it on screen for folks watching at prisonplanet.tv we've
[13:07.840 --> 13:12.360]  got a compending them there of the quotes and the statements about how he
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.720]  hates helpless Americans and I countered him in US today and other big
[13:17.720 --> 13:22.400]  publications picked up my quotes about him being a Nazi who likes to preen
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.880]  and poses a strutting steroid head peacock and that we don't we don't like
[13:28.880 --> 13:33.200]  his kind around here so he can ausländer reich or how do they say it in
[13:33.200 --> 13:39.880]  Deutsch foreigners out we can start with Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger so
[13:39.880 --> 13:46.080]  ausländer reich is that how you say it that means get out of our country get
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.640]  out of here I wouldn't mind it so much if he was Austrian and talked about how
[13:50.640 --> 13:56.960]  he loved the Republic and love the Second Amendment and didn't talk about how he
[13:56.960 --> 14:00.480]  wants to be a dictator and what didn't pass carbon taxes on the back of
[14:00.480 --> 14:05.560]  Californians but I'd still say you know prudence wins out even if he was a
[14:05.560 --> 14:09.720]  Ron Paul type he shouldn't be able to run for president just like I shouldn't
[14:09.720 --> 14:14.960]  be able to run for president in Austria and I got news for you I can't you know
[14:14.960 --> 14:20.240]  you got to love it Mexico has the most draconian immigration laws in the
[14:20.240 --> 14:26.880]  Americas from Alaska down to Chile from Brazil up to Venezuela to Canada they
[14:26.880 --> 14:29.600]  have the most draconian even the Washington Post admits that the State
[14:29.600 --> 14:33.320]  Department admits it they put people in slave labor camps from Guatemala or
[14:33.320 --> 14:36.040]  other Central South American countries that were caught coming into Southern
[14:36.040 --> 14:40.960]  North America into Mexico and the police will beat up and kill anybody they
[14:40.960 --> 14:45.200]  want but then if we don't give free welfare and goodies to the illegal
[14:45.200 --> 14:49.480]  aliens pouring across from Mexico waving Mexican flags who are so upset by
[14:49.480 --> 14:54.120]  American flags in Texas Arizona and California that school children including
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.120]  Hispanic school children can't wear American flags that's my problem see
[14:59.120 --> 15:02.600]  it's kind of like Schwarzenegger saying he wants to be a dictator I don't like
[15:02.600 --> 15:06.280]  him and it's like a large portion of these illegal aliens from Mexico
[15:06.280 --> 15:11.200]  chanting down with the US at soccer games that's been covered on television
[15:11.200 --> 15:15.800]  and and running around with Mexican flags and tearing down American flags at
[15:15.800 --> 15:23.000]  post offices and running up Mexican flags I can't handle it okay I mean I mean in
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.040]  Mexico wanted to become the 51st state and the people had a history of liberty
[15:27.040 --> 15:30.320]  and freedom down there and we're into the Second Amendment into private
[15:30.320 --> 15:34.800]  property I'd say 51st state I'm not scared of folks down there because they
[15:34.800 --> 15:40.400]  got a nice tan I kind of wish I had one you know I like a tan okay the problem
[15:40.400 --> 15:45.360]  is is what's in the mines down there and I don't like it and I want that to be on
[15:45.360 --> 15:49.840]  record here okay I'm done talking about it I'm done talking about it and the
[15:49.840 --> 15:54.240]  globalists are force-feeding this globalism this collectivism into the
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.200]  poor folks in Mexico I want them to have liberty and freedom it's a country
[15:58.200 --> 16:01.320]  with triple the resources than we've got okay I said I'd get into the news and
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.960]  I'm not doing that I'm now ranting off into Schwarzenegger and then shag weighing
[16:05.960 --> 16:10.000]  into Mexico and and then going into the next issue and the next issue after
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.880]  that but you know sorry the illegal aliens when they do vote I've seen the
[16:15.880 --> 16:21.560]  national polls over 90% of them voted you know illegally in many cases or people
[16:21.560 --> 16:27.400]  that were recently citizens to take my guns to suck whatever capitals left in
[16:27.400 --> 16:31.440]  me and my family and pay it into the welfare I'm done the country's bankrupt
[16:31.440 --> 16:36.200]  I'm done you run your flag up and tell me your anti-liberty I'm your enemy so get
[16:36.200 --> 16:40.600]  that straight and put it in your pipe and the police take a big succulent
[16:40.600 --> 16:46.840]  corpulent draw of that tobacco of truth down into your lungs and see how you
[16:46.840 --> 16:51.440]  like it see how that draws for you see if you can grok it to use a line from
[16:51.440 --> 16:57.640]  our Heinlein book stranger in a strange land do you grok it do you get it do you
[16:57.640 --> 17:04.560]  read me over good I'm glad continuing here this is the big news really of the
[17:04.560 --> 17:10.280]  day this is the big news it's hiding in plain view and it's just really hard for
[17:10.280 --> 17:14.360]  me to sit here and watch it go on but this is part of that Overton window
[17:14.360 --> 17:19.000]  where they do things so radical that it just trains us all they take us a million
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.800]  miles down the road of tyranny and even though we know it's tyranny we just
[17:22.800 --> 17:28.800]  basically get our backs broken and accept it and as Barry Goldwater said
[17:28.800 --> 17:32.720]  extremism in defense of liberty is no vice we're dealing with extreme
[17:32.720 --> 17:36.400]  government criminals in both major parties we're dealing with extreme
[17:36.400 --> 17:42.320]  decadence and lethargy and and and and sloth like behavior from the average
[17:42.320 --> 17:46.280]  American myself included we've got to get supercharged we've got to get
[17:46.280 --> 17:50.040]  awakened we've got to get angry and we've got to get focused and I know Paul
[17:50.040 --> 17:54.080]  Watson's listing right now we're working on an article together is working on
[17:54.080 --> 17:59.000]  some big breaking news with the dead twitty birds as well and what that
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.280]  ties into but but this is a big story and when I saw this last night I did some
[18:03.280 --> 18:08.680]  research I did some more this morning I'm looking at federal and state law but
[18:08.680 --> 18:14.440]  there's no doubt that this is illegal and there's a big paper trail on this and
[18:14.440 --> 18:18.880]  if we can just get the media to pick up on it but mainline conservative media
[18:18.880 --> 18:23.480]  doesn't want to do this because they do some of these same influence peddling
[18:23.480 --> 18:29.880]  that the Chicago crime machine and the mayor's father is literally one of the
[18:29.880 --> 18:34.280]  most famous mobsters in history right up there with Bugsy Siegel and Al Capone
[18:34.280 --> 18:39.680]  and of course the Chicago police no one denies that's a mafia machine if there
[18:39.680 --> 18:43.880]  ever was one I mean you don't serve the cop his tenth drink he just beats you up
[18:43.880 --> 18:48.680]  I mean it's like well you're drunk we can't let you give me the drink shaking
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.520]  people down I've been in Chicago just trying to videotape on the streets and
[18:52.520 --> 18:57.520]  had cops march over and just go turn your cameras off but you could tell they
[18:57.520 --> 19:01.160]  were real crooks these weren't you know you normal cops is trying to act like
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.360]  thugs and they just got their Billy clubs and said turn them off and I could
[19:05.360 --> 19:08.680]  tell right then it was turn them off or we're gonna give you multiple
[19:08.680 --> 19:12.960]  concussions maybe even kill you and I just said okay just because I
[19:12.960 --> 19:16.560]  understand that's an area already destroyed already taken over by gun
[19:16.560 --> 19:21.480]  grabbing mafias notice mafias always want your guns I mean what when criminals
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.480]  march into a bank and say you know stick them up the first person they do you
[19:26.480 --> 19:32.040]  first person they pistol whip first thing they do is pistol whip the guard and
[19:32.040 --> 19:36.600]  take their gun and tie them up I mean that that's what gun control is it's
[19:36.600 --> 19:41.520]  tying up the slave you think they let slaves in Rome have swords think they
[19:41.520 --> 19:45.440]  let black people 200 years ago have guns first gun laws this country we're
[19:45.440 --> 19:49.480]  against blacks I continue when we come back Obama is said to be considering
[19:49.480 --> 19:58.680]  naming JP Morgan's daily to top White House post and this just ties into all

[24:09.200 --> 24:17.240]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we've had a corrupt
[24:17.240 --> 24:21.280]  government for a long time but it's rotten through and through and nowhere
[24:21.280 --> 24:25.840]  is this illustrated better than the daily family you have the big daddy one
[24:25.840 --> 24:30.000]  of the most famous mom bosses out there and one of his many children has been
[24:30.000 --> 24:36.320]  the Chicago mayor for a long time but William Daly one of the brothers is a
[24:36.320 --> 24:42.480]  top JP Morgan Chase and co-executive former US Commerce Secretary he replaced
[24:42.480 --> 24:48.000]  Ron Brown who was said publicly if I go down the Clinton's gonna go down and
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.720]  then the aircraft over Serbia the special ops on board the intel we've got
[24:53.720 --> 24:59.080]  is and this even came out in the news part of it put on their oxygen mask shot
[24:59.080 --> 25:03.400]  everybody on board the plane blew the side hatch and what is it he load or
[25:03.400 --> 25:06.440]  high load out there should be two different types where they put on the
[25:06.440 --> 25:12.360]  oxygen mask and jump out at high altitude and we know that because it got
[25:12.360 --> 25:16.400]  leaked out of the army and out of the different medical centers where the
[25:16.400 --> 25:20.960]  autopsies were done that they all had bullet holes in their heads and they
[25:20.960 --> 25:26.160]  even had the caliber and then the media tried to whitewash that so the head
[25:26.160 --> 25:30.840]  coroner a colonel went public you remember all that so Ron Brown got
[25:30.840 --> 25:37.520]  taught real good and then one of the mob boss children you know one of the bad
[25:37.520 --> 25:44.560]  sons one of the droppings of the old mob boss daddy it became the head of the
[25:44.560 --> 25:49.080]  Commerce Department with the missile secrets to China and the he helped ram
[25:49.080 --> 25:55.200]  through NAFTA and GATT top globalist and his brother helped get behind of
[25:55.200 --> 26:00.880]  course Obama and another little P that was in the same pod Blagojevich they
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.520]  got him in and his governor you know they get their people in everywhere and
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.440]  that's how they control society and then as soon as they get in they say oh
[26:09.440 --> 26:13.480]  there's thousands of Chevy dealerships if you haven't been contributors the
[26:13.480 --> 26:16.400]  Democratic Party and hadn't paid protection money or if you don't give
[26:16.400 --> 26:20.280]  money right now we're gonna take your dealership worth millions of dollars
[26:20.280 --> 26:24.240]  give somebody else and they did and now if you're not an insider and don't give
[26:24.240 --> 26:29.080]  money well you don't get the waiver to not have to buy insurance for employees
[26:29.080 --> 26:34.640]  so your hamburger shop or your auto body shop or your factory you don't have
[26:34.640 --> 26:40.360]  to get health care for your people but all your competitors they do so you get
[26:40.360 --> 26:44.600]  to undercut them and that's what we would NAFTA and GATT is on a global scale
[26:44.600 --> 26:48.920]  they can have all these tariffs on us overseas we can't have any on them and
[26:48.920 --> 26:52.160]  there's no environmental standards no carbon taxes there's many different
[26:52.160 --> 26:57.280]  forms of tariffs that we put on ourselves not on foreign goods that's
[26:57.280 --> 27:00.680]  all part of globalism then the insiders get to write the law where they're
[27:00.680 --> 27:06.080]  exempt and you wonder why their main retailer now more than 40% of global
[27:06.080 --> 27:10.640]  retail sales death mart with the telescreens going in it and by the way I
[27:10.640 --> 27:15.160]  saw the first video of them actually going in TV screens right there above
[27:15.160 --> 27:20.240]  the magazines at the checkout counter with big sis with a AP news feed under
[27:20.240 --> 27:24.720]  it so it looks like a TV show that's the only thing that's been altered it's big
[27:24.720 --> 27:29.640]  sis saying watch everybody spy on other patrons I mean super creepy we're gonna
[27:29.640 --> 27:33.920]  play that later Watson and I think Steve Watson is doing a report on that so
[27:33.920 --> 27:39.040]  they're now actually being phased in 9,000 locations not just 844 Walmart's
[27:39.040 --> 27:45.160]  I mean this is getting crazy but looking into the law it is clearly
[27:45.160 --> 27:51.440]  influenced peddling and that's what this whole operation is and of course all
[27:51.440 --> 27:55.080]  of this other thieving is just icing on the cake the big one is the trillions
[27:55.080 --> 27:59.920]  being given to the foreign offshore banks and Congress being buffaloed I
[27:59.920 --> 28:04.120]  guess a Jedi mind tricks the best term where the Federal Reserve chairman and
[28:04.120 --> 28:07.400]  the Treasury chairman and others just get up there and say we're not gonna
[28:07.400 --> 28:11.960]  tell you where the money went in hearing after hearing in the House and Senate
[28:11.960 --> 28:16.240]  Banking Committee it's happened hundreds of times now two years ago it was big
[28:16.240 --> 28:19.520]  news and they do it a year ago it was still big news now we've again been
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.360]  conditioned that just well some crooks in suits all mobbed up they just tell us
[28:25.360 --> 28:28.160]  they won't you know get into where the money went and in case you think it's a
[28:28.160 --> 28:32.760]  partisan issue it's not remember the two trillion missing the day before the
[28:32.760 --> 28:37.200]  World Trade Center's got blown up associated press you know headline two
[28:37.200 --> 28:40.600]  trillion missing from Pentagon by the time that congressional hearings in
[28:40.600 --> 28:45.120]  2005 it was four plus trillion and the word is now it's over seven trillion and
[28:45.120 --> 28:48.320]  some people didn't see in the emails they don't look up the news article to
[28:48.320 --> 28:51.000]  find out I'm telling them the truth or the congressional hearings that are on
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.920]  YouTube they you can just type in trillions missing from Pentagon into
[28:55.920 --> 28:59.880]  YouTube Google you'll you'll get articles video clips hearings about it
[28:59.880 --> 29:04.400]  people just say it's not true they say oh the bolt the whole defense budget's
[29:04.400 --> 29:07.760]  only a trillion a year how could they be stealing trillions a year they stole
[29:07.760 --> 29:14.680]  the Pentagon pension fund investments and that came out ten years ago even
[29:14.680 --> 29:19.640]  ahead of 9-11 and it's now come out last year in Bloomberg and AP and Reuters
[29:19.640 --> 29:25.440]  just oh prudential and other insurance carriers 11 years ago in 99 made deals
[29:25.440 --> 29:31.000]  to take veterans death benefits when they die the money's all gone your social
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.080]  security's gone the death benefits the health care you're gonna get euthanasia
[29:36.080 --> 29:40.280]  death panels in its place but not before they trick you and say get behind
[29:40.280 --> 29:43.720]  raising taxes and you'll still get your handouts you're not gonna get the money
[29:43.720 --> 29:47.320]  you put in you got it you're not gonna get any of it you're gonna get a boot

[33:43.360 --> 33:48.960]  high-tech police state in place to further suck us dry so getting back to
[33:48.960 --> 33:54.240]  the open mafia system in front of us you know almost every other nation on
[33:54.240 --> 34:01.720]  earth has a tiny rich elite and a giant underclass you look at Mexico you look
[34:01.720 --> 34:05.520]  at Argentina you look at Brazil you look at Eastern Europe you look at many
[34:05.520 --> 34:11.920]  areas of Asia Africa and Americans always laugh oh look at the foreigners
[34:11.920 --> 34:16.360]  they're so corrupt you know they've got cops with machine guns on the streets
[34:16.360 --> 34:23.320]  in Brazil or Mexico or Nigeria or Eastern Europe oh look at them their
[34:23.320 --> 34:28.480]  government devalues their currency you know those folks in Mexico they just
[34:28.480 --> 34:32.760]  can't figure it out well the United States isn't perfect but the mainstream
[34:32.760 --> 34:37.440]  media spends a lot of time demonizing what was America what did work with
[34:37.440 --> 34:41.680]  America because they don't want you to know the antidote to their poison they
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.200]  want to try to discredit things that are common sense and we know work how did
[34:46.200 --> 34:51.760]  five percent of the world population get roughly half the world's wealth how
[34:51.760 --> 34:59.560]  do we do that we had more liberty more freedom than other countries that's why
[34:59.560 --> 35:05.240]  geographically not a very big country compared to many doesn't have the
[35:05.240 --> 35:10.240]  resources of even a Mexico or a Nigeria did you know Nigeria overall has more
[35:10.240 --> 35:15.280]  resources in major encyclopedia Britannica breakdowns than the United
[35:15.280 --> 35:20.920]  States you know Mexico has triple roughly whether it's gold oil timber fertile
[35:20.920 --> 35:26.840]  fields volcanic soil a to z Mexico's got roughly triple the resources natural
[35:26.840 --> 35:32.080]  gas fisheries they got everything you go down there and you get outside the
[35:32.080 --> 35:36.560]  tourist traps looks like a bomb hit that place sewage running down the street
[35:36.560 --> 35:41.440]  little kids running around police bugging their eyes out at you the public
[35:41.440 --> 35:47.080]  scared of the police that's called a martial law banana boat Republic we
[35:47.080 --> 35:53.520]  know what it looks like now America is becoming the strip mall version of that
[35:53.520 --> 35:57.920]  to the globalist it's not just that they don't care and will steal everything
[35:57.920 --> 36:03.360]  and destroy a society they want to they want to destroy the old republic they
[36:03.360 --> 36:07.400]  want to claim that our empire fell when really it's just gonna fall into the
[36:07.400 --> 36:10.800]  hands of the IMF and World Bank so they've got all these historians now
[36:10.800 --> 36:15.800]  predicting the fall of the American Empire the end of the Empire quite
[36:15.800 --> 36:19.720]  frankly if this Empire was run properly it probably never fall because of the
[36:19.720 --> 36:24.920]  high-tech grids that are in place they want it to fall it's designed to fall
[36:24.920 --> 36:29.720]  fall right on top of those other sovereign nations fall right on top of
[36:29.720 --> 36:36.240]  what's left of our country fall right on top of what's left of this country's
[36:36.240 --> 36:49.400]  reputation so the issue here is people shouldn't make fun of third world
[36:49.400 --> 36:54.760]  countries they never had our founders they never had a bill of rights they
[36:54.760 --> 36:59.480]  never had a Constitution almost every time other nations have had revolutions
[36:59.480 --> 37:03.880]  even if it was a good military leader who overthrew the dictator that guy would
[37:03.880 --> 37:08.080]  get knocked off you know the person who tried to bring in a republic who tried
[37:08.080 --> 37:12.120]  to bring in a parliament or a legislature a Congress people would
[37:12.120 --> 37:15.480]  gather around within the Congress and decide to overthrow the whole country
[37:15.480 --> 37:23.200]  for themselves so they could steal all the goods but we actually had founders
[37:23.200 --> 37:29.480]  who were different they weren't perfect but they were super men compared to what
[37:29.480 --> 37:36.720]  every other country said super men they make the Greek system at its height
[37:36.720 --> 37:43.040]  look barbaric and police state it makes all other supposed free societies look
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.080]  like a joke and it's all slipping away it's all burning away it's all going the
[37:48.080 --> 37:57.800]  way of the goonie bird the dodo bird the sea lecanth and I don't like that I
[37:57.800 --> 38:02.360]  don't want to be a slave I know what New World Order globalism means it means I'm
[38:02.360 --> 38:08.000]  a high-tech slave in a global system run by people who are stated open eugenicist
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.040]  and who on record say they want to forcibly reduce our population and I
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.680]  watch the sperm counts drop by 87% I watch infertility and women skyrocket I
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.560]  watched diabetes and cancer and Alzheimer's and arthritis the list goes
[38:22.560 --> 38:27.120]  on and on every disease you can imagine off the charts and then I look at all
[38:27.120 --> 38:31.480]  the government's own studies they know full well what they're doing but like
[38:31.480 --> 38:35.120]  children the average person including bureaucrats in government are
[38:35.120 --> 38:38.680]  compartmentalized don't have the knowledge and even when they come face to
[38:38.680 --> 38:44.920]  face with the facts it's easier to just say oh that guy is a conspiracy theorist
[38:44.920 --> 38:48.440]  and my is it a conspiracy theory that over four trillions isn't from the
[38:48.440 --> 38:53.760]  Pentagon is it a conspiracy theory that we have a mafia running the country who
[38:53.760 --> 38:58.920]  openly gives over 500 last time I checked it's hundreds a month exemptions to
[38:58.920 --> 39:02.920]  mobbed up companies so they don't have to get health care for their employees
[39:02.920 --> 39:12.720]  but you do I do is that a conspiracy theory is it a conspiracy theory that
[39:12.720 --> 39:17.600]  four and a half thousand children were publicly it's been declassified as
[39:17.600 --> 39:20.880]  public information radiated to death and I know I talk about that all the time
[39:20.880 --> 39:25.160]  it's just one of the more well-known ones of thousands of cases so I mentioned
[39:25.160 --> 39:30.720]  what's known nerve-gassing our own trips I mean we're not in Kansas anymore
[39:30.720 --> 39:36.800]  we're really not and and I'm not here risking my life if I didn't think we
[39:36.800 --> 39:40.920]  had a good chance of beating these people it's outrageous it's cartoonish what
[39:40.920 --> 39:47.760]  they're doing it's absurd it's out in the open it's brazen and I'm sick of it
[39:49.320 --> 39:54.920]  here's an example of why societies can't ever get it together folks in
[39:54.920 --> 40:03.080]  Pakistan are highly intelligent in their IQ test as smart as anybody in Europe
[40:03.080 --> 40:13.120]  or Japan highest IQs ancient culture ancient language but they've been
[40:13.120 --> 40:19.280]  corrupt forever and so their giant population what is Pakistan's population
[40:19.280 --> 40:23.280]  is it a hundred million or more pull up the Pakistan population for me please
[40:23.280 --> 40:28.840]  and then Nigeria is like 300 million in Africa but powerful Pakistani governor
[40:28.840 --> 40:35.200]  killed by own guard there's an example and whether this governor was a good guy
[40:35.200 --> 40:42.920]  or a bad guy you know the issue is that's what Banana Republic is all about
[40:42.920 --> 40:49.040]  170 million powerful Pakistani governor killed by own guard the governor
[40:49.040 --> 40:52.840]  Pakistan's wealthiest and most populous province was shot dead in the capital
[40:52.840 --> 40:56.920]  today by one of his own guards who later told interrogators that he was angry
[40:56.920 --> 41:02.240]  about the politicians stance against the country's blasphemy law official said
[41:02.240 --> 41:09.320]  yeah sure and I'm sure that that former top bush advisor probably fell and hit
[41:09.320 --> 41:12.960]  his head and fell in a trash can and got ended up in the dump and I'm sure the
[41:12.960 --> 41:19.000]  mob family the dailies are gonna save us because they're such good people they're
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.480]  in the Commerce Department they'll make sure we get jobs I mean why not hire you
[41:24.480 --> 41:30.000]  know one of the guys from Central Casting of the Goodfellas what I'm funny
[41:30.000 --> 41:40.480]  like a clown but here it is Obama is said to consider naming JPMorgan's daily
[41:40.480 --> 41:48.800]  to top White House post and he's the former head of the Commerce Department
[41:48.800 --> 41:54.760]  President Barack Obama's considering naming William Daley a JP Morgan
[41:54.760 --> 41:57.960]  Chase and co-executive can we have anybody in the government who isn't JP
[41:57.960 --> 42:02.040]  Morgan Chase or Goldman Sachs I mean most the third-world countries that are
[42:02.040 --> 42:05.240]  being looted are run by Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan alumni and they just run
[42:05.240 --> 42:09.200]  everything there's your problem right there a bunch of insider trading
[42:09.200 --> 42:13.880]  swindlers and the Congress has been gelded they sit there with their knees
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.200]  knocking afraid of them such a move which is still under discussion would
[42:18.200 --> 42:22.800]  bring Washington veteran oh a veteran that's what we need yeah when you're a
[42:22.800 --> 42:28.760]  mobbed up crook from a crooked organization caught you know selling
[42:28.760 --> 42:33.360]  derivatives into the world market and rigging the stock market and selling
[42:33.360 --> 42:41.000]  people housing stocks that you know are based on fraud that makes you a veteran

[42:46.120 --> 42:52.120]  veteran of government such a move which is still under discussion would bring a
[42:52.120 --> 42:58.800]  Washington veteran oh yes and someone with strong business ties to the
[42:58.800 --> 43:03.520]  business Locosa Nostra into the administration as Obama sets out on
[43:03.520 --> 43:07.620]  agenda for the second half of his term while dealing with the Republican
[43:07.620 --> 43:15.360]  majority in the House of Representatives I got another headline Obama pledges to
[43:15.360 --> 43:21.120]  use executive power to Trump Congress well why not if you got a bunch of
[43:21.120 --> 43:28.680]  slimy oily bankers robber barons in there stealing everything why not have

[44:01.680 --> 44:06.560]  not illegal under Bush you liked all those no-bid contracts and then the
[44:06.560 --> 44:10.240]  neocons had a talking point on radio they'd go of course American companies
[44:10.240 --> 44:14.800]  deserve the contracts it wasn't no bid contracts for just American companies
[44:14.800 --> 44:18.120]  no it could be any foreign company they wanted French German didn't matter

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.240]  examiner story and then it's got quotes I believe by the Washington Post Obama is
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.280]  going to use executive power to Trump Republican Congress I believe that's the
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.680]  headline because I want to get into that that deals with this whole massive
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:11.000]  abuse of power situation I found it never mind I found it right here again

[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:23.000]  going through a lot of different gesticulations of outrage dealing with
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.760]  the daily mob machine Chicago machine taking over every facet of our society
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:40.520]  Obama ready to deploy executive powers against GOP on the hill deploy them of
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.920]  course Congress makes the laws Congress controls the purse strings but in this
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.680]  upside-down world people thought well Obama's gonna clean up all this rampaging
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.480]  executive power Obama's gonna get tough on bush crimes how about accelerating
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.240]  all of them and all these Democrats are going we're so disappointed I'm so
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:07.480]  disappointed aren't she shut up either and it goes on Obama ready to deploy
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:14.160]  executive powers against GOP on the hill President Obama challenged
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.640]  congressional Republicans to embrace the shared responsibility of governance
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:25.280]  even as the see they're putting the mob boss JP Morgan Chase daily you know in
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:33.560]  the White House running things and that is all spun as he's experienced he's a

[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.160]  that the birds are dying but happy if they were dying other states because
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.880]  that would lean towards a disease the problem is the Fish and Wildlife
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.400]  Department and others and I saw it on CNN they had them all chopped open the guy
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.320]  was just pulling them open when look they're just turned into blood their
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:43.080]  their their livers of their breast meat that their organs are their muscle tissue

[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:29.880]  deploy executive powers against GOP Hill and we're already seeing this where
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:35.760]  they couldn't pass the greenhouse gas tax system federally so Obama has come
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.400]  in and seized the permitting process for power plants in Texas so see as long as
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.960]  the state does what the bureaucracy says not what the Congress says and that
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.640]  be a states rights issue right there outside federal jurisdiction power
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.480]  generated inside the state but still there's some federal argument there but
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.760]  with no law no nothing the feds just show up and say we're taking over your
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.960]  power plants here's the higher standards if you can't meet these shut down and
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:08.240]  then giant fines start racking up every day they're in operation until they get
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.480]  shut down don't worry though they'll just pay the fines you'll pay the fines
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.000]  I'll pay the fines but oh no environmental standards on Chinese
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.480]  reactors 2 to 3 being built excuse me power generators not nuclear reactors
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:28.840]  coal power plants so that is coming up briefly before I go to your calls and
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.160]  get your take on the birds and I do want to be brief so I want to get to
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:38.960]  everybody here 1-800-259-9231 ahead of Wayne Madsen popping in and then Max
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:45.360]  Kaiser on the economy in 2011 that we're now in hurtling towards 2012 and
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:50.640]  beyond but I wanted to just you know just state normally when green goo
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.560]  rains from the sky it's happening routinely or when stuff gets sprayed and
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.320]  there aren't eyewitnesses who can you know conclusively prove that it was
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:03.840]  government we don't really go there but we know that there have been as I've
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:10.560]  said thousands and thousands of admitted declassified programs with in many
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:16.680]  cases lethal or toxic chemicals biologicals radiologicals that's all on
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.880]  record you've seen it up 10 million times you're solving the news but they
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.360]  always report it dryly oh the government killed some troops oh the
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.320]  government injected some kids oh the government spread polio oh you know
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.920]  here's the inventor of the polio vaccine laughing about how they knew it had
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:37.160]  cancer viruses in it 100 plus million Americans contracted viral born cancers
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:45.600]  that were rare before now common and died I mean this is all just public and so we
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.240]  have to look at what could have done this and as we go down the line
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.680]  eliminating everything what's left but some type of government experiment or
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:01.560]  government test or there's been a lot of mainline scientific theories and it's
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.960]  been videoed all over the world minutes before a giant earthquake that Aurora
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:11.760]  Borealis type things even form in the daylight some type of giant tectonic
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:21.000]  shift with untold quadrillions I don't even know the mass of huge tectonic
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.480]  plates let's do the calculation colliding with each other and it causes
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:31.280]  some type of electromagnetic event that manifest in the atmosphere kind of
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:36.480]  like when you're walking across the carpet on a dry December day and you
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:40.960]  touch the refrigerator metal door and you see I've been in the dark before
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.200]  going to the refrigerator for a glass of milk the middle of the night and I've
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:50.400]  seen the electricity I've seen the blue arc that's a microcosm of why it's been
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.360]  documented for thousands of years that right ahead of an earthquake birds start
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.520]  flying out of the area and fish start swimming the other direction dolphins
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.800]  start running sometimes days before because they can sense in the magnetic
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.680]  field which more and more science shows all animals can pick up on in the brain
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.440]  in the hypothalamus and other areas and but but animals go with their instinct
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:17.000]  and go the other direction and that's a manifestation of it those lights you know
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.280]  appearing minutes or sometimes hours sometimes days before it looks just like
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:26.760]  an Aurora Borealis green yellow bluish light can be seen even in daylight
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:30.480]  sometimes it's so bright but especially at night people will be in South
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.720]  America where they don't have an Aurora Borealis like they have the north and
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.960]  south pole they'll be like what is that they notice birds are all flying at the
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.280]  opposite direction freaking out monkeys are going crazy I mean this stuff goes
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:46.680]  on it's been well documented mainline science you can research it for yourself
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.640]  you like to look into it almost if you already know that but but the issue here
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.720]  is it could have been something like that you got the fish dying but that
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:58.320]  happens because of oxygen shifts or they may have had a bloom of fish and they
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.800]  were overpopulated it was a natural culling we don't know but the two could
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.600]  be related but now you've got birds in Louisiana first it was 500 now it's a
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:14.600]  thousand as they find more the same species of blackbird very very bizarre
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:19.520]  because if they were falling out of the sky and in the in the region you normally
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.360]  think they had contracted a virus or a bacteria and then only certain numbers
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.320]  would die and then when the veterinarians from the state and local cut them open
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.920]  they would see the evidence of disease they're totally healthy and the head
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.000]  of the fish and wildlife their head veterinarians on record saying they
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.480]  were pulverized inside and that's not going to happen from some birds running
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.720]  into each other scared from fireworks you know over a whole town first it was a
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.200]  half mile then a mile then a mile and a half now two miles now now they're
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.600]  finding them all over the town going out upwards of three miles depending on the
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:59.320]  local report you look at the issue here is that it might be disease in Louisiana
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:05.680]  and other states with these dead starlings or cedar wax wings I forget
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.480]  what are they what's the blackbird with the little red patch what's the species
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:15.400]  of this critter I get my apples and oranges mixed up thank you looked that
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:22.080]  up for me brain but the issue that I'm trying to cover here is this thing
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.640]  stinks to high heaven and it's a big mystery and if I can take that mystery
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:32.240]  and write about it at info wars calm and then get nationally syndicated radio
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:37.960]  shows like coast to coast a.m. reaching 16 million people a night opening an
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.800]  Anthony reaching about 2 million a day drudge report reaching tens of millions
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.760]  a day to link to the story and we're asking the real question you've got to
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.600]  look at the number one culprits of bizarre happenings and chemical
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.960]  biological radiological testing its government and so we link over there to
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.240]  the government archives and sites where they admit that they've done tests like
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:04.720]  this in the past many times and so people now we're looking at one of the
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.600]  possible causes of this but becoming educated about all the other admissions
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:20.640]  while we go along yeah it's a red wing blackbirds so it's a it's cedar wax
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.560]  wings I believe is their name the media is calling them blackbirds and black
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:32.320]  redbirds it's it's it I believe it's cedar wax wing correct now they're
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.360]  saying they're starlings whatever the blackbirds a little red patch and they
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:43.920]  said the same species in Louisiana and in and in Arkansas okay let's go to your
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.280]  phone calls here let's talk I want to go as quickly as possible Randy in
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:54.080]  Michigan you're on the air yes this is exactly what you said happened as well
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.040]  with the was it the barium and they're finding the lead when they did the plane
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:02.160]  dot trails and then following that there was a story I'm news covering it and
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.880]  exactly what's happening with the birds is what when you mentioned we did get
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.600]  reports out of Arkansas and I know over the weekend here in Texas it was Kim
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.480]  trail central and for those that don't know the government admits and has the
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:18.480]  patents for barium salts aluminum dioxide added to jet fuel to then be
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.360]  dispersed and the airlines don't even know they're doing it sorry go ahead well
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.080]  I think I'm just saying yeah that came true exactly like you said not like a
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.200]  year after and same thing as well I'm like I'll just give you an example today
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.520]  I was watching the news and on comes this thing about an iPhone app to tell on
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.080]  your on people on the road and they're going to cover it tonight and our
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.640]  Detroit news here in Michigan WDIV Channel 4 and they're going to cover it
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.560]  about an iPhone and that's just another thing that happened exactly not even a
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:51.000]  year after you were talking about it and like yeah so I was just wondering if
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.200]  you think this is tied into that same the bird issue is tied into that same
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.040]  thing with the barium and the lead being found and then all of a sudden it's on
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.240]  the news this guy went out and you know just a homeowner went and collected it
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.440]  somehow and brought it in and found all this stuff in there and barium is used
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:09.400]  for like radioactive excuse me this may be something new I know that they mix
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.400]  barium salts and aluminum dioxide in the weather mod system and it also then
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:19.160]  destroys the soil kills trees and other plant life and hurts all mammal species
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:25.120]  are you saying it's on the news that barium was found in BB Arkansas well I'm
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.000]  not sure if it was in it might have been Arkansas I'm not a but I remember
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.200]  buying a YouTube clip of the actual local news clip of the other like I don't
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.320]  know if it was a farmer or a guy that I've seen news reports where they've
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.640]  tested the chemtrails and it's been barium I appreciate your call speaking
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:44.040]  of surveillance they don't come out and say oh it's big brother we're gonna watch
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.480]  you in your house they have the Houston police chief five years ago come out
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.760]  before years ago and say oh we're gonna put cameras in your homes of that might
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.000]  help stop crime they have a New York Times article about how great it is that
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.360]  smart cameras are going in everywhere to watch doctors and make sure they wash
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:04.160]  their hands to watch employees to watch kids and report you to the police if you
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.160]  don't see you're guilty until brievin innocent and it's worse than 1984 and
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.440]  they're just going to it let's talk to Wayne in Arkansas Wayne you're on the
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:21.880]  air hey Alex a doing good go ahead well first off I live up here called Searsie
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:28.120]  County which is north central Ozarks about probably an hour north of DB and
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.160]  we've noticed just unbelievable Kim spraying last several years and there's
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.540]  been a huge decrease in all species of birds the turkeys have basically
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:39.960]  disappeared yeah I've got the reports here not just the bees but the bumble
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.560]  bees are almost all dying but the government's not worried about that
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:48.080]  they want to put a tax on carbon dioxide that plants breathe well it's it's
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.200]  obvious that other things going on I heard you on coast to coast last night
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.760]  tried to call in because we're also crazy to some of the people out there
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.960]  listing that we're also seeing strange craft in the air at night they're
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.440]  definitely not helicopters no no the government admits they've given the
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.800]  state and local government covertly they have National Guard running them all
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.960]  sorts of drones and a lot of them look like flying saucers and it's all meant
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.080]  to again scare everybody yeah there's a lot of strange things going on up here
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:23.720]  and you know I think it's all tying in I listen to you basically every day and
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:26.920]  I think it's all tying in with the biblical prophecies and that these
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.400]  people are basically they're tied to Satan the people that run our world now
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:37.200]  and I think people better get the way they can that's why I moved up here
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.920]  several years ago from Texas I actually used to live in Houston Texas down there
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.600]  and I'm sure you're aware of what an evil corporate place that is oh they had
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.200]  drones six seven years ago surveilling you there but don't worry the Pentagon
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.280]  now is gonna domestically deploy something called the Gorgon with eight
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:59.000]  face scanning cameras flying around in disc-shaped craft space scanning you in
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.800]  the streets and it's called the Gorgon is it really possible to get out of debt
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.960]  without payment plans or attorneys 18 years ago we developed a program that
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:12.400]  has made thousands debt free in just 90 days it's called zero debt in 90 days
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.560]  and it works for all credit card debt medical bills even collection lawsuits
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:21.520]  when I first joined I was being sued so I use the program methods and after
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:26.160]  filing one piece of paper the collection lawsuit was dismissed with zero debt in
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:30.000]  90 days your success is guaranteed in writing there is no other program of
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.880]  its kind don't be along with creditors gang up on you let our team of experts
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:37.400]  provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:41.800]  guaranteed prevent wage garnishments bank levies and stop collection calls with
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:48.240]  our proven program call zero debt in 90 days now 800 477 9256 and ask for free

[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.040]  people know ever since president Nixon took us off the gold standard the US
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.640]  dollars been evaluating what people don't know however is how this directly
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.400]  affects your personal finances is there a way to protect your portfolios from
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.760]  losing value the answer to all of this is gold and silver they both have
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:20.600]  maintained their purchasing power for six thousand years if you had a hundred
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:24.040]  thousand dollars in cash and a hundred thousand dollars in gold and silver back
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:28.360]  in 1913 and kept them until now your cash would have the buying power of only
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.160]  four thousand eight hundred dollars but your gold and silver would have the
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:34.640]  buying power of three million dollars the answer to protecting your assets is

[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:40.040]  thank you I'm prison planet script subscriber I've been listening for a
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.160]  little bit and I appreciate what you and your team are doing thank you very
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:48.600]  much well done yes thank you and I just wanted to let let you know I don't know
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:53.360]  if you heard but I guess BBC's putting out some type of cover story it looks
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.400]  like saying that poisonings being ruled out after several cats and dogs dogs
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.360]  ate the dead birds and suffered no illnesses and that that they believe
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.640]  that it's the fireworks that have caused thousands of birds to fall from the
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.080]  sky of Arkansas town over New Year's Eve and be pulverized and I guess the
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.720]  latest ones to fall out of the sky last night that was fireworks to the middle
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:20.880]  of nowhere in Louisiana again I would love to believe that fireworks went off
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.360]  I was shooting fireworks off I drove out to the country and there were doves and
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.360]  things shitting and trees 50 feet away that just flew off I started shooting
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.840]  them off right as dusk hit on New Year's Eve on Friday I do like my fireworks
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:40.840]  folks the mortars and all the rest of them and it was a lot of fun but I mean
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:45.240]  it's just asinine I mean you don't have 5,000 birds notice how they always play
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:50.200]  it down all being pulverized and being found dead they were dead when they hit
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:57.120]  the ground I mean did 5,000 have a heart attack instantly no that isn't how this
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:01.200]  works it's ridiculous and we've not really said it's poisoning I more and
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:06.200]  more it looks like some type of magnetic weapon system or maybe it was
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.680]  some freak lightning storm but where were the houses being hurt where were the
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:15.280]  trees being destroyed I mean startling sit-in trees at night what do you
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:20.840]  think's going on I personally think it's some of the that's crap that they're
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:24.560]  spraying up in the air I mean like I'm living out here in California and I see
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.720]  that I wake up in the morning early at like seven in the morning I see that in
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.960]  the skies like or above where I'm living and I live next to some sort of like
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.440]  larger agriculture area live by oh that's another great point you just made I
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.840]  mean I tend to think it was some type of weapons test some type of electromagnetic
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:46.480]  but I mean we're just you know striking out in the dark here but a cat is like a
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.480]  human birds are known to not be able to take a lot of toxin that's why canary
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.240]  in the coal mine that's why they've always used them in laboratories for
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.720]  hundreds of years for other gases or chemicals they'll act weird and fall over
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.480]  dead you know they're very delicate compared to something like a cat or a
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.880]  dog I mean a dog can eat a rotten possum off the highway and come back for
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.680]  seconds to not even get an upset stomach you know I mean a human can't do that so
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:15.000]  just because cats and dogs have had a little bit of a you know a meal doesn't
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.360]  mean that there isn't some type of toxin in them Kim Trails electromagnetic I
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:22.120]  don't know yeah I mean I've got the mainline reports there about the honey
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:27.400]  bees and the bumblebees and and all sorts of other wildlife you know drop
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:33.480]  and dead it's just it's funny because it does say however that that the person
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:36.840]  that she stopped sort of declaring that the mystery solved by saying further
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.960]  tests on the birds are planned still you know well I want to know how their
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:45.840]  organs were liquefied I mean I've shot plenty of dove and quail with a 12-gauge
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.480]  shotgun up in the air and sometimes if they're close and normally you're
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:55.120]  shooting one at 50 yards away or 40 yards away or even further but if you
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:58.880]  shoot one say 20 yards away say some quail come up and you hit them with
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.840]  three or four BBs it doesn't pulverize it it just shoots holes through them it
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.880]  you know it just tears through the meat through the liver through the guts
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:10.960]  through the gizzard I mean I've shot birds with shotguns over and over again
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.840]  and then you walk over if you know what you're doing rip their breast meat out
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.800]  pull out any BBs throw the guts and the feathers down you'll have a plastic bag
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:27.880]  with your a1 sauce or your leon parents Worcestershire with pepper and when you
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:33.000]  get back you get you know six or seven or more juicy quail or dove breast boom
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.440]  they hit the skillet boom green beans over here mushrooms whatever you're
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.200]  doing get the bottle of Jack Daniels out don't do that anymore I'm just joking
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:46.000]  loves and you know you're off to Valhalla look birds running into each other
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.760]  doesn't liquefy their organs got it I've done my own post-mortar monotopsies on

[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.040]  for one segment I wanted to get him to briefly pop in on short notice we
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:41.520]  appreciate him a Wayne Madson report.com forum with the NSA syndicated
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:46.880]  columnist to give us his breakdown on believing on all these new bombings we're
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:54.040]  seeing being provocateur operation gladio programs all these bombings popping
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:58.040]  up in Europe and all these new announcements that the bombings are
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:01.840]  gonna come here and we see this on the heels of all these pats he's being set
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:06.920]  up these low-grade morons that the FBI keeps going out and finding and trying
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:10.600]  to get to blow up things we'll get Wayne Madson's take on that also on the
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:15.920]  Chicago crime machine with Mr. Daly William Daly headed former head of the
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:24.080]  Commerce Department when Ron Brown got whacked headed into the whole you know
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:29.800]  White House operation chief but before we go there I do everything I can to
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:34.240]  promote Made in America and if Americans would just try to buy American and would
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.560]  seek out American products we would have some economy left in this global
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:42.640]  assistance they've done everything they can to deindustrialize this country to
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.600]  make us dependent and so when I heard this song and started promoting it on
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:51.160]  air I thought why not just play it and why not promote it on info wars.com and
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.880]  prison planet.com and in the media section of info wars.com we have American
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:01.960]  company teams up with country star Mark Wills to keep jobs in America and it's
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.680]  a three and a half minute song we're gonna play it and then go right to Wayne
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.920]  Madson when breaking information but I hope everybody will get this single it's
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.760]  free and get it to everybody they know we need music whether it's rock and roll
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:18.680]  or country or classical to have a political message of liberty and he's a
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:23.920]  very talented artist I mean I you know I promote people like Steve Voss and
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:31.480]  others or Dave von Kleist I mean this is another patriot promoting the ideas of
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:36.760]  made in America and this is what needs to be on the country music stations you
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:40.760]  know who claim they're so patriotic this is the type of music people need to
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:46.200]  hear it's from the album looking for America and the song is looking for
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:36:07.680]  America and the mp3 is posted up on info wars calm right now here it is I'm

[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:31.200]  for something I ain't seen in a while I'm looking for a factory where a man can
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:38.480]  feed his family not worried about them move it itself closing the doors and

[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:42.480]  yeah we gotta find it cuz we're looking for the land of free and the home of the
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:53.680]  brave seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone long gone but I know in
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:39:00.240]  my heart it's still out there can somebody please tell me where I'm looking
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:24.160]  for American well that's mark wills the new release of the song looking for
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:27.840]  America and that's the type of message we need to see if we're gonna get this
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:32.960]  country back through the popular culture and so I just salute diamond gusset
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:37.040]  jeans for promoting this and posting it on their site and getting behind it and
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:40.280]  giving away free copies of it when people visit the site and some of the
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:43.680]  special offers they have to get blue jeans made in America and of course
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.920]  that's a gusset.com forward slash America okay I will hold him to the end of
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.720]  the hour then I'll take calls in that first little segment and I promise I'll
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.600]  take calls while Kaiser's on for everybody that's holding is I want to
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:59.800]  get to everybody but there's so much news to cover in the 21 minutes we've got
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:05.720]  left of this hour with Wayne Madsen Wayne Madsen report.com our sites of
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:11.800]  course are info wars.com and prison planet dot TV between 85 and 99 Madsen
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:15.080]  held a series of jobs first working for RCA as a government consultant and
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.080]  contract for the National Security Agency later he worked for the Navy's
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:23.560]  Naval Defense Automation Command he actually hunted down submarines as a
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.120]  civilian employee after this Madsen briefly established a consulting firm
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.840]  then worked for the National Bureau of Standards and later for the State
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:35.800]  Department in 1990 he joined the CSC working in 1990 until 97 where he joined
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.880]  the Electronic Privacy Information Center great folks as a senior fellow in
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:46.760]  late January 2005 Madsen left Epic and again he just has written for some of
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.320]  the biggest publications in the country and we appreciate him joining us to talk
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.880]  about a host of issues but let me before we get into Operation Gladio
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:00.080]  Gladio reprised more false flag operations everybody's really upset
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:04.160]  about the bird situation now they're finding a whole bunch more dead in
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.000]  Louisiana not just in BB Arkansas the issue here is as a bird hunter who shot
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.360]  plenty of dove and quail you shoot them with a shotgun the pellets don't
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:18.320]  pulverize their flesh and and liquefy their organs they they say they're
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:22.560]  disease-free this looks like some type of weird government test or something or
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:29.000]  what else could it be Wayne Madsen from your you know wide well-read brain what's
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.960]  your gut on this Wayne well come to mind we know that that particular part of
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:41.120]  Arkansas very close by in Guy Arkansas has experienced the number of earthquakes
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:46.760]  what they call earthquakes to warm we also know that a lot of migratory
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:52.480]  birds use the mag the low magnetic field of the earth to navigate and
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:57.360]  obviously something they have interfered with that what I don't know
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.840]  is it natural occurring or is it something that could be related to some
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:07.440]  military experiments I think the jury is up one thing I don't buy is that these
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:11.760]  birds will go out of the sky because somebody was setting off fireworks on
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:16.320]  New Year's Eve I mean the people that creating out on local and national
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:22.040]  news look like the rate off of a set of green acres you know they really don't
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:25.720]  have much you know fishing wildlife experts you know they come to these
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:32.360]  conclusions after how many six packs of Budweiser so the other the other thing
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:37.840]  is the drumfish again they are very susceptible to sound they use sound of
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:45.320]  course so they're very susceptible to any kind of frequency so I think
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.840]  you know there's obviously more to the story and I'm not a scientist I don't
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:54.840]  pretend that I am one but I'm really not buy it but you did deal with sonar in
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:59.360]  the Navy and yeah I mean I'm a layman myself but I know they don't just have
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.520]  the sound cannons the military admits they've developed high-powered acoustic
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.040]  weapons that can literally shatter steel buildings and we're talking super
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.280]  type weapons or we know that when there have been earthquakes it can even
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:19.600]  create bizarre fields that are even more powerful so there's no telling here
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:24.960]  it's just people are really wanting to know but but going back to these these
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.280]  buoys they set up all over the world and the the correlation of beached whales
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:34.880]  and other marine mammals whenever the Navy and other navies have done these
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.080]  high-powered ping test we know that whales communicate over thousands of
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:45.280]  miles and now can't because there's so much acoustical pollution in the ocean
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:48.560]  how is that interesting line to follow as well
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:54.480]  well yeah so of course and again with earthquakes of course they will
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:00.760]  affect sound transmission that will cause sound transmission low-frequency
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:07.200]  transmission in the ocean and we've had a huge number of earthquakes reported
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:15.040]  just in the last year a second one in New Yorkshire in England yesterday a week
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:22.160]  after one near the Scottish border so these are not the areas that you expect
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:27.560]  to hear about this kind of activity England New Hampshire the other day
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:34.760]  and and some other very unusual areas so is it natural is it man-made I think
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:39.120]  that's that's the question that needs to be answered right now now well I'm glad
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.720]  you brought up the earthquake issue because that's where I was going nest
[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:48.200]  next then we'll shift gears into the gladio situation is the new Madrid
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:53.320]  fault earthquake zone coming to life the American dream blog wrote this up and
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.720]  links to a whole bunch of mainstream news articles that there are having all
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:00.760]  sorts of earthquakes all over the Midwest and onto the East Coast and of
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:05.200]  course for those that don't know just since the colonies have been colonized
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.720]  just the last 300 years the Mississippi River has what changed course twice that
[01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:15.520]  I know of in some cases by many miles after huge mega earthquakes imagine what
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:19.720]  a big earthquake would do to the Mississippi if that fault line becomes
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:25.080]  active again I mean where I live in Austin has three extinct some argued
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:29.720]  dormant volcanoes I mean this country is covered and we know the big super
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:34.840]  caldera that is Yellowstone has become very active again so certainly I think
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:41.160]  your point about the earthquakes they've measured more than 500 earthquakes some as
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:47.400]  high as 3.8 magnitude in places like Indiana and it all seems to be building
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:53.120]  so that would add more weight to what you're saying right in the EU
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:58.800]  Commission actually came out with a statement last week saying that 2010 was
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:05.040]  a record year for quakes and the Austrian government said that they had
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:12.400]  50 registered in Austria 10 in Kira province itself and that was record
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:18.440]  too so we have European governments and institutions talking about this is not
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:23.400]  normal the USG asked on the other hand the US Geological Survey is always
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:28.600]  saying oh this is quite normal when in fact it is not normal and we have the
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:33.120]  EU and Austria backing up the fact that it's just not normal sure and
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:36.560]  investigators again are puzzled in Louisiana over bird deaths as well
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:40.960]  that's up on info wars.com from the advocate.com okay Wayne in the time
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:47.200]  we've got left I really pay attention to everything you say but I really pay
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.240]  attention when you start talking about gladio and we've got your report up at
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:57.920]  prisonplanet.com gladio reprise more false flag operations why don't you
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:02.960]  briefly fill folks in on gladio and then that's what I thought seeing these
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:08.720]  latest events that it mirrors what we saw with gladio in the 60s 70s and 80s
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:14.600]  always rearing its head during political tumult. Well gladio was a CIA
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:19.880]  operation which actually used a lot of the assets of the Galen organization
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:27.720]  now Reinhard Galen was a Gestapo officer and Hitler's secret police he was
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:34.120]  used by the CIA after World War II to help set up what it were known as Stay
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:39.360]  Behind Networks and in the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe there would
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:45.960]  be these units these cells that would have access to buried or hidden away
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:52.640]  caches of weapons and ammunition to do guerrilla attacks on Soviet occupying
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:57.320]  forces these not only existed in NATO countries but also in more
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:02.720]  interestingly in neutral countries like Switzerland Austria Finland and a few
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:10.040]  others Spain before it joined NATO and and a few others so what happened in
[01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:19.120]  the 70s and 80s was we saw with the rise of leftist activists in Europe there
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:25.200]  were false flag attacks done by gladio units that had access to these weapons
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:30.840]  that were then blamed on there the red brigades of Italy the red army
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:36.800]  faction and in Germany they kidnapped and assassinated a former Italian Prime
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.440]  Minister Aldo Moro that was blamed on the left would in fact it looks like
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:46.000]  that was carried out by these gladio units also there was a parming of the
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:51.160]  train station in Bologna Italy that was later found to be carried out by the
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:55.360]  gladio unit so these of course were blamed on the left this now what we're
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:02.880]  saying is in Europe will we see that the the burgui man of the Islamist jihadis
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:09.760]  is that is kind of fading although we see roundups but we've heard the Italian
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:14.640]  police commanders say these recent bombings at embassies or attempted
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.520]  bombings at embassies in Rome and similar bombings and happens of
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.920]  embassies are being carried out by a network of anarchists throughout Europe
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:29.840]  so that sounds amazingly like the charges we heard from Denmark when they
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:35.160]  rounded up five people they claim we're trying to blow up a newspaper office in
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:40.720]  Copenhagen that this was a pan-European network I think with the
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.600]  impending general strikes and street demonstrations in Europe coming up this
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:52.640]  year on the austerity programs the budget cuts the pension cuts we're seeing
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:58.320]  the the bankers and the oligarchs in Europe trying to now work the left
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:04.520]  movement of the workers and students movement to the jihadists and we're
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:12.080]  going to see a full court press to try to link those two organizations and go
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:17.560]  after people who were out in the streets rightfully and just justifiably
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:23.320]  protesting what the bankers have done to these various economies very well said
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:28.320]  I mean it's classic and we see Gladio raising its ugly head really based on
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.560]  the NATO option Gladio as you mentioned got its name because that was the one
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:34.960]  area that went public the head of Italian intelligence went public later the
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:39.120]  Italian president went public that the CIA and NATO were in there blowing up
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:43.160]  school buses trains you name it they love killing kids but then blame it on
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:47.520]  whoever their political enemies were who were becoming politically popular well
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:51.120]  now you got all the people mad at the big banks so suddenly there's all these
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:56.640]  bombs going off and the state gets to then pose as the savior and say look
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.560]  those that are against the banks raping you they're terrorists I mean it's very
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:05.040]  simple psychology hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are
[01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:09.080]  now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:12.240]  you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:15.920]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:19.760]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:23.320]  our friends and solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:28.800]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:32.840]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:36.840]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:40.920]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at

[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:22.400]  closing Wayne how do you how do we respond to the tried and trusted false
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:29.240]  flag attack that the Russians engage in the Chinese the British Israel the US
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:33.040]  I mean this is a tool used by governments it's been leaked and
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:37.160]  declassified literally hundreds of times some of the public still says
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:40.560]  governments would never do that yes they'd inject foster children with syphilis
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:45.880]  yes they'd radiate foster children but they wouldn't do that no good these are
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:51.040]  good people in government I mean what do you do just attack the lie of terror
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:55.680]  okay let's say the terror is real don't take my rights I'll take my chances I
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:00.080]  mean is that the answer because it's this nanny state now of everything must be
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.320]  surveilled by our great protectors but we have a better chance of dying from a
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:08.120]  bee sting every year than dying from terrorists I mean how do we respond a to
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:13.560]  things like stage terror gladio and be what does it signify that they're really
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:19.120]  heating this up in Europe and now we're seeing these kind of abortive Patsy
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:25.560]  failure operations here in the US well I think it takes critical thinking there's
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:30.480]  really not a whole lot of ways to avoid the 24-7 news channels but when they
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:36.160]  report something like this incident in Denmark were rounding up these guys one
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:40.120]  guy was actually innocent he was released because all he did was rent an
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:45.080]  apartment of some of these other guys but when you see a guy like the Danish
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:50.000]  head of police intelligence getting on there and he turns out he's nothing more
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  yuck up sharp as nothing more than a show for for the Israelis it takes
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:03.760]  critical thinking and and and you know I think that's what people just have to
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:10.960]  stop believing that they hear on CNN and Fox News and MSNBC and unfortunately the
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:17.800]  BBC and others are falling into this as well just say it's baloney but then try
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:22.720]  to find out why we're putting out this information well that's the other issue
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:27.280]  I mean we learned in the Madrid bombings six seven years ago it came out in their
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:32.040]  news that intelligence agencies were involved it came out in the 7-7 event
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:36.280]  I mean it just always comes out but that's after the news cycle is over
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.120]  it's a footnote that it's the intelligence agencies running it and
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:44.400]  they may burn some drug addict you know Pat's the occasional name but that's
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.840]  it and when people start hearing about anarchist being responsible for terrorist
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.640]  attacks them in Europe and maybe here remember it was the police caught
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:58.680]  changing in and out of the black guard that anarchists wear at the B20 and
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.560]  GM conferences they were the ones who were throwing the blitz through the
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:06.600]  start they've been caught in Denver, Canada they've been caught in Toronto
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:10.720]  they've been caught in Greece I mean they get caught everywhere this is the
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:16.040]  M.O. and also when you hear of a new group claiming responsibility as we heard
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:20.560]  in Italy that no one's ever heard that before just think it's another
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:31.640]  fakery organization and all of its McDonald's franchises that have now
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:35.920]  opened up around the world North Africa, Arabian Peninsula. You've got Amar al-Alaki
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:41.400]  you've got you've got Ghaddan all of these guys are admitted government
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:48.440]  Spokes. Absolutely and we heard that the Spanish police intelligence guy
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:54.800]  Sharp basically trying to link what happened in Denmark at David Hedley who
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:59.240]  was accused of being behind the Mumbai attacks and now turns out Hedley was
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:04.400]  working for the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA. And by the way
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.800]  the BBC is reporting that the police told everybody to evacuate and get away
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:14.400]  from the church that got bombed in Egypt we're not saying there aren't real
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:18.360]  Muslim terrorists but they're very rare it's like finding a leprechaun you know
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:23.480]  in your backyard. Some of these people do exist but in every case we see it's
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:28.600]  always intelligence with its hands all over it same thing same thing in Egypt
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:35.440]  Wayne. Absolutely and Egypt is another example and unfortunately many more in the
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:38.720]  Middle East Europe. Hold on this is too important we got to do five more minutes
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:41.880]  and I promise I'll get to your calls to stay there.

[01:59:54.280 --> 02:00:01.760]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:13.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:34.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:38.840]  Wayne Madson of the Wayne Madson Report I want you to continue here we've got
[02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:42.920]  your detailed report up at PrismPlanet.com linking over to WayneMadsonReport.com
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:50.320]  Gladio reprised more false flag operations and the fact that I'm gonna be
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:56.880]  honest with you I'm a lot less scared of Muslims that are xenophobic and want to
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:00.960]  control their country and want people out I know Christians have gotten along
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:06.080]  by and large with Muslims so have Jews except for during the Crusades and then
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:09.160]  in some of the more modern times on average that's an oversimplification
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:17.520]  Wayne but I know that again it's out in the open and in fact I need to pull the
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:21.200]  mainstream news article up I'll do a search while you're talking that the
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:24.880]  police in Egypt got everybody back said get it get away from this Christian
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:29.640]  church before it got bombed and it's just always the same they always know
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:33.720]  they always give warnings to insiders Oklahoma City first World Trade Center
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:38.080]  attack second World Trade Center attack on 9-11 and we see as the whole world
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:42.520]  politically gets angry the state's fingerprints all over these events and
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:46.760]  now these internal warnings getting leaked and even US in today's hyping it
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:52.960]  that this year we're gonna see massive truck bombs and terrorist and the head
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:57.160]  of the Justice Department says he loses sleep at night with domestic groups why
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:03.080]  the militias are gonna link up with Adam Gadan and and and a locky and we've
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:06.480]  just got to go after the American people because they're now with the Muslim
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:10.920]  extremist well one important thing is the one measuring stick I use any time
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:15.640]  you see what blips are hyping a story like he did on the bombing and the
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:19.680]  church in Alexandria Egypt that that usually tells me because I know who he
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:25.680]  really works for that tells me what's behind a lot of this there that was a
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:30.660]  remotely controlled car bomb that went off in Alexandria and on Al Jazeera they
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:34.880]  had a Middle Eastern journalist saying this is new for Egypt they haven't had a
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:39.960]  history of this not like they have in Lebanon but that remotely controlled
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:46.160]  car bombs or a telltale sign of particular intelligence agencies and I
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:52.680]  would put about pulling out that what we saw in Egypt has now exacerbated
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:58.600]  tensions between the 10% Catholic Christian community and the 90% Muslim
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:03.080]  community in a country they've had problems in the past but now it's really
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:09.760]  reached the crescendo so who benefits by the strength in Egypt on the
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:16.920]  Egyptians are saying that it is a it is foreigners responsible but they have not
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:21.240]  said al-Qaeda they haven't really pinpointed it but they've said foreigners
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:27.480]  and that doesn't say it was necessarily jihadists and notice exactly and and
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:32.080]  notice just like with 9-11 we were shown old videos of Palestinians
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:35.680]  celebrating something that was later confirmed to have been staged
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:42.400]  magically there's video of a renomab you know celebrating the attack on the
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:47.400]  church right on time this has all the makings of some type of Hollywood
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:53.920]  scripted situation absolutely so I think we're gonna see we've also had the
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:58.920]  bombings of churches in Baghdad as well I think it's the same type of scenario
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:04.440]  being played out there to exacerbate tensions we only have between the
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:08.560]  she is in Sunnis in Iraq and now now we have them well with the Iran I've had
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:12.240]  Ray McGovern the former top braver to Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:17.640]  talk about how our government blew up the Golden Mosque in Iraq to get the
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:22.440]  Shiites and Sunnis killing each other I mean they've been caught British MI6 as
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:27.560]  you know special air services arm got caught dressed up like like Sunnis
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:31.120]  running around kill a shooting and killing Shiites
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:36.240]  same thing in Pakistan we've seen the same thing play out there where you as
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:41.000]  intelligence has been behind some of the attacks in that country as well so this
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:44.960]  is pretty standard operating procedure these days so it signifies things are
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:47.760]  really heating up that suddenly this stuff's popping up everywhere
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:52.360]  absolutely all right Wayne Madsen I guess it's pointing towards Iran
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:59.800]  possibly an attack there I could be I hear you I hear you Wayne we'll talk to

[02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:47.920]  always great to have him on we've got so many things to talk about we've got
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:51.720]  William M. Daly former head of the Commerce Department under Clinton with
[02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:55.800]  a mysterious death of Ron Brown now to go in and head up the White House
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:00.760]  operations for Obama talk about influence peddling and we've got Obama
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:04.400]  announcing that he's going to use executive authority to do whatever he
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:09.680]  wants in the country so expanding things that Bush did there's a lot of other
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:13.160]  important news we're going to be covering the incredible explosion of
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:18.520]  silver and gold get Max Kaiser's view of what's headed into the new year we've
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:24.200]  got all these other announcements that are coming out showing more and more
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:30.400]  very serious storm clouds on the horizon a lot of amazing police state
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:34.120]  developments that I haven't gotten to court okay searches of cell phones
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:39.760]  without warrant and now the TSA is grabbing people's phones downloading
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.600]  stuff off of them their computers without a warrant they're copying people's
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:48.280]  credit cards but now the police are saying they can just do this to to
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:56.080]  citizens I mean this is this is insane I mean your cell phones your little
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:59.960]  computer your little personal computer and so they're saying that when you when
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:04.400]  the police arrest you and you're taken into custody they don't even need a
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.600]  warrant for that I mean this is really crazy I mean the folks this is bonafide
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:12.000]  they're getting rid of the bedrock other Bill of Rights first they told you it
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.320]  was for al-Qaeda down the road and now they say no it's for you the American
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:19.720]  people and an iron curtain of tyranny is ascending around the world I want to get
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:25.520]  into all the mysterious what our last guest Wayne Madzen was saying is clearly
[02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:28.800]  inside job terror attacks in Europe in the Middle East and all the evidence is
[02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:34.640]  there but but first off Max what do you think about the bird mystery no
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:43.760]  microwaves fireworks secret weapons what liquefies the innards of 5,000 birds
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:49.680]  Max Geiser well I asked about these birds right off the bat man I mean you
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:55.240]  know a lot happening in the banking sector you know the birds I don't the
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:59.320]  birds for the birds are the birds bees the bees are all dying off remember a
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:03.520]  couple years ago the bees started dying there's another huge die-off of bees
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:07.880]  bees without bees there's no agriculture there's no food and then you have to
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:12.480]  rely on people like Montanto birds are dying the fish are dying it it's
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:17.280]  industrialization gone crazy it's pollution it's killing the natural
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:22.840]  habitat and it's causing premature human extinction that's been the trend so
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:27.480]  they have a natural world can only take so much pollution and then it starts to
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:33.200]  die off despite what some new members of Congress might feel is written in some
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:39.440]  ancient text if you put a certain amount of garbage into the planet's ecosystem
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:46.400]  you will kill the ecosystem well Max I agree with you on that but we're told
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.000]  put a tax on what plants breathe and in the history of this planet they know
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:58.920]  that carbon dioxide has been many many many times higher than it is now why do
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:04.960]  they focus on paying taxes to Al Gore in the UN instead of open-air genetic
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:10.000]  engineering of the German government studies connected to BT corn killing the
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.480]  bees the electromagnetic studies out of Europe and even the US and Canada that
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.560]  the electromagnetics are killing trees and grass nearby retarding their growth
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:27.040]  I mean my problem is government isn't focused on anything that's actually
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:32.720]  causing problems they just want to tax what I exhale yeah they're the response
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:39.600]  to this problem you've got two responses taxes and carbon trading in the area of
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:44.120]  carbon emissions now the problem with taxes as you point out is if it's going
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:47.480]  to be controlled by the same corrupt government then we have no expectations
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:51.920]  that they would do any better job at collecting any kind of tax in any
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.840]  reasonable way that related to anything as far as carbon trading goes well that
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:03.520]  goes to Wall Street in Wall Street is going to use it as a scam to pocket
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.360]  themselves billions of dollars and destroy that market as well just like
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:11.360]  they destroyed every other market and just like they're destroying what's
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:15.160]  coming on with Facebook I don't know if you saw the news of Facebook but they
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:19.280]  just did a deal with Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs now gets to buy 450 million
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.640]  dollars of the Facebook totally bypassing the FCC rules and regulations
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:28.200]  they're just breaking the law openly the FCC has said we got to take a closer
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:31.760]  look at this people who follow Wall Street tell you this is completely
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:36.480]  illegal what they're doing they're just allowing folks to cash in on Facebook
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:41.440]  without giving the public a chance to cash in on Facebook even though it's the
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:45.200]  public that has made Facebook the 50 billion dollar company this way
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:49.320]  uploading all of their photos and chats and all of the messages that they
[02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:53.080]  upload to Facebook well that's worth 50 billion dollars the Goldman Sachs
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:56.760]  clients how much is going to get those to the people who actually created the
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:00.720]  value of Facebook the public they get absolutely nothing and it's completely
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:05.520]  illegal and don't forget also that Facebook uses Zenga which is a virtual
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:11.280]  currency and Zenga is a new way to load people up with another new way
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:16.160]  another huge wave of debt so they they're going into a whole new virtual
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:21.480]  world of debt just like Monsanto uses seeds to create agricultural debt
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:26.240]  Wall Street uses debt to create debt now you've got Facebook who's gonna use
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:29.960]  Farmville and Zenga and virtual currencies to create virtual debt
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:36.320]  exactly seeds were always a ever replicating renewable resource but
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:40.920]  now Monsanto and two other big giants as part of an admitted strategic takeover
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:46.840]  program make them agents of death that take over and infect the rest of the
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:52.080]  DNA of the planet of the biosphere not just mutilating but but irrevocably
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:57.040]  damaging and then you've got to buy from them every year it doesn't continue the
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:03.480]  life cycle this is blasphemy according to all laws of nature or any religion but
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:09.480]  where are the Christians the Pope is out now promoting GMO it's of the Lord I
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:15.400]  mean this is so devilish what we see it is completely devilish the Monsanto
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:20.040]  what they call terminator seeds are seeds that don't reseed they don't
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:24.320]  populate they don't you know dandelions would bloom without without seeds that
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:27.120]  would scatter to create more dandelions but in this case talking about
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:32.080]  agricultural products or food so wheat and other food stuff would not bear
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:37.280]  seeds to regenerate themselves so all that becomes an intellectual property
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:41.280]  about a company like Monsanto and when other genetically modified padded
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:47.200]  seeds blew into the field of a guy who was not growing Monsanto seeds Monsanto
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:52.080]  sued him for intellectual property violation because the wind blew their
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:56.440]  product into his farm without him even knowing about it so this is what they're
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:59.800]  trying to control the agriculture the same way they said tries control the
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:03.800]  money supply with debt Monsanto is trying to control the food with
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:07.720]  terminator seed and intellectual property seed and Facebook now wants to
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:13.040]  control the cyberspace with virtual debt and Zynga based virtual currency well I
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:18.560]  have an analogy I have an analogy max of the because it is a genetic issue
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:26.320]  Monsanto which literally owns the courts has their former heads as the head of
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:30.880]  the EPA the head of the FDA they've got all the bases covered same thing in
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:36.560]  Europe they get caught smuggling seeds in and other companies do into
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:42.160]  countries as literal military outpost and it's the equivalent of this they
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:49.080]  come and plant GMO canola right next to your field or GMO soybeans whatever the
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:54.160]  cases have been many cases of this or GMO corn it blows into your field they
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:17:02.520]  trespass and and have planes drop roundup bombs on it it kills an area then
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:07.560]  they fly over and see that a few plants are alive those were the few that were
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:11.880]  Monsanto from seeds getting in or part of their genetics and then they come sue
[02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:15.880]  you admitting that they infected you that'd be like of a man a next-door
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:21.640]  neighbor moved in stalked your wife raped her and then when she got
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:27.480]  pregnant he he comes and demands the baby saying it's his instead of going to
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:31.840]  jail that's that's what Monsanto does right and they're doing it on an
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:36.440]  intercontinental basis they've totally destroyed large parts of India's
[02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:41.080]  agricultural industry this is why thousands of Indians farmers have
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:46.840]  committed suicide because they are sold Monsanto seed to the point of a gun and
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:51.440]  then when they can't afford to upgrade because the seeds don't reproduce and
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:54.960]  they are heavily in debt because they have to go in debt to keep buying the
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:58.000]  seeds and by the way the fertilizer that genetically modified to fertilizer
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:02.280]  only works with genetically modified seeds so they get you have to buy the
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:06.880]  GM fertilizer the GM seeds and of course they go in deeper into debt and
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:11.640]  thousands of them are killing themselves and that this is what part of the
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:17.960]  Monsanto program is that there's their death merchants and they're far more
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:23.000]  you know if you do a little experiment you can do an experiment right now and
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.840]  you know they don't the Monsanto lawyers are deeply embedded in the
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:33.440]  internet anytime you can anyone can try this if you write a blog about Monsanto
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:40.240]  you know they are right on you quickly they are much more litigious than Exxon
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:44.120]  or the energy companies there they are really in my opinion of all the
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:49.840]  companies I've tracked over the years they are the absolute worst well
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:55.360]  finishing up with Monsanto and these other big GMO companies if you go back
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:01.400]  to Henry Kissinger's State Department memorandum 200 Kissinger said we'll
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:06.000]  use food as a weapon we'll take over the third world and I mean it's an amazing
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:11.600]  business model coming out of this coterie of companies and I guess that's
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:15.440]  just the way it is we've just got to submit to it and worship them and it's
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:19.200]  wonderful well it's it's dead and of course they they go in there with this
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:23.440]  idea that they're staving farmers and they're making food available and they
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:26.600]  get them hooked on these they intellectual property protected seed that
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:30.760]  they administer like a central bank it's a currency if they see the agricultural
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:35.120]  currency it was all debt based and so you have agricultural debt you have
[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:38.880]  monetary debt from the central banks which you cover all the time you know
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:42.600]  this very well then you have this new virtual debt which is coming via Facebook
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:46.400]  which is now a bit of Goldman Sachs who is financed with some Russian oligarch
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:51.360]  people and they're putting together now a multi-billion dollar six hundred
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:56.720]  million user debt farm a virtual debt farm and you predicted that it would be
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:20:00.120]  turned into a giant casino gulag we'll be right back with Max Kaiser with his

[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:08.000]  the gold standard US dollars been evaluating what people don't know
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.840]  however is how this directly affects your personal finances is there a way to
[02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:15.520]  protect your portfolios from losing value the answer to all of this is gold and
[02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:19.600]  silver they both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years if you
[02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:25.520]  had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept

[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:04.680]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:08.600]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:12.880]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:23:12.880 --> 02:23:17.120]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:21.480]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:25.600]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:30.120]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:34.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:38.200]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:42.040]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:44.760]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:50.720]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:55.400]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to
[02:23:55.400 --> 02:24:13.800]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 okay I want to get to your
[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:19.160]  calls I want to get into what's happening with the economy but let's get
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:28.440]  Max Keiser's 2011 predictions for the economy Max Keiser well my fiction
[02:24:28.440 --> 02:24:33.280]  number one oh hell breaks loose that's my number one prediction massive chaos
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:38.520]  everywhere it's the economic chaos and ecological chaos what I call the eco
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:46.320]  eco chaos scenario EEC as the eco eco chaos scenario and they're feeding on
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:50.960]  each other so like in Australia because of the massive flooding their coal
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:54.720]  industry is collapsing and the economy is going through a gut-wrenching change
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:58.360]  which of course is going to force them to do something silly like increase the
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:03.120]  money supply which will only cause more pressure on people to buy precious
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:06.720]  metals in other places of the world so the ecology breaking down and the
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:10.800]  economy breaking down are feeding on each other to create this massive
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:16.320]  chaos chaotic nightmare in 2011 already starting to see that happen number two I
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:23.240]  think finally you're going to see the silver shorts get their behinds kicked
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:29.120]  for example today is a good example the price of silver is down 3% or 4% but
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:33.720]  when I'm looking at the exchange traded funds I don't see any volume there's
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:37.680]  nobody actually selling physical silver today so where does that where does that
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:41.840]  price action come from it just comes from the paper market nobody's selling
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:44.920]  their physical silver today they're just loading the boat with more of these
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:49.200]  naked short sales coming out of Wall Street again but I think that this year
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:55.040]  this game is going to end because ultimately there's a tipping point where
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:59.600]  I spoke with David Morgan on my show Kaiser Report and he reiterated the
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:04.200]  point that for every physical ounce of silver you take off the market you kill
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:11.520]  100 paper ounces and that leverage is fantastic and the bank stole our wealth
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:16.600]  now it's time to take our wealth back in the form of the silver I think that's
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:23.200]  going to continue to rise in price and then the price rise is tied to how
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:29.040]  upset people are going to be and you know the the greater the outrage the
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:33.080]  higher the price will go house prices look like they're going to another leg
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:38.560]  down and well interesting now the commercial real estate is going to go
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:44.440]  through a gut wrenching decline all the malls in America are pretty much empty
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:49.760]  sears sales are down Walmart sales are down so at the meeting to bottom end
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:54.600]  retail sales are crashing all those malls are empty you see some sales
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:59.400]  progress in the high end in places like Tiffany because the claptocrats and the
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:04.240]  aristocrats of course like to buy the occasional bubble but for the math
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:09.480]  consumer out there sales are definitely down and you know those are my three
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:15.760]  top picks well I have to agree with you I mean it's mathematically impossible
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:25.200]  right now to ever be able to pay back the 1.5 quadrillion in false
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:28.640]  derivatives but you can see what the system is doing they're setting up a
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:32.680]  police state to politically suppress us they have announced and I have that
[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:37.200]  report here that they are starting to seize all or part of pension funds in
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:41.760]  Europe that's the headline I mean and we know Europe's just a few years ahead of
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:46.080]  where we're at and Max I got a ribby a little bit but I mean I know it's tongue
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:49.400]  in cheek a bit but you live in France because you don't like the police state
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:55.680]  here but Europe is you're basically owned by the the cousins of the people you
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:28:01.560]  know so to speak that own this country you know the same ilk of of kleptocratic
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:08.360]  mafia and so we're all getting our goose cooked here but but how much will the
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:12.560]  population put up with because people just five years ago would blame a
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:18.480]  Sarkozy or a Gordon Brown or a George W. Bush or a Barack Obama almost no one
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:22.440]  now you know really thinks presidents actually run something I mean doesn't the
[02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:26.600]  ruling oligarchy have a problem because they're up there running around like
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:30.480]  robber barons being pulled around by their white horses in front of everybody
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:35.320]  well I'm like as I've been saying on your show for a few months now when I say
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.840]  when I attack the US and I say people should leave the US I always talk about
[02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:46.360]  Brazil and Chile you know Brazil and Chile are two countries that are really
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:53.400]  great opportunity for people looking for a stable government and real honest to
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:57.000]  goodness yeah but can I own a gun to protect myself from kidnapping I mean I
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.000]  know pretty soon we're about to be just like Mexico basically kidnapping capital
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:05.680]  but I mean certainly there are but you know Brazil is an enormous country and
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:09.280]  there are cities and towns all over Brazil that are sleepy little towns that
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:15.400]  or marginally active towns that I think offer a greater and upside for the
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:19.240]  average person in the US who's just getting screwed I mean their government
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:23.160]  treats them like dog dirt their opportunities have been squeezed out
[02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:28.440]  because the bank stole all the money so there's immigration why not be immigration
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:31.520]  you know historically that's what how does the founders of America come to
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:34.840]  America they immigrated they left the UK they got sick of the UK they guys
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:37.920]  work at that they got to tell you I might move to Brazil if I could have a
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:45.280]  Barrett 50 Cal but I can't hey Max over there in France hey hey Max you got a
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:48.920]  boomstick in there under the pillow stay there I want to talk to you about
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:54.960]  this and take phone call stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the
[02:29:54.960 --> 02:30:00.960]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:07.480]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:13.120]  is our last chance to not relive history as a finishing off this agenda that we
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:17.280]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home turn members influence
[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:22.120]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think
[02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:27.520]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:32.680]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:37.000]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:41.200]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[02:30:41.200 --> 02:30:44.880]  Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does
[02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:50.880]  care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get
[02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:56.200]  your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching
[02:30:56.200 --> 02:31:04.520]  online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot TV hi folks this is
[02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:08.280]  Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can
[02:31:08.280 --> 02:31:12.560]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:16.720]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the
[02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:20.120]  respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:24.840]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:29.880]  yourself produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano
[02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:34.200]  particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:38.400]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:43.200]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:48.000]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to

[02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:06.760]  very wealthy u.s. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[02:32:06.760 --> 02:32:11.280]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything

[02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:35.040]  we're gonna hold Max Kaiser is gonna ride shotgun with us at least 30 minutes
[02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:39.480]  into the next hour of super overdrive it's actually just overdrive I guess we
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:43.120]  went into a fifth hour it'd be super overdrive we're really do that of course
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:47.280]  did the 27 hour broadcast last year I think I'll do one of those again this
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:52.000]  year maybe two that was fun but Max Kaiser is our guest for at least another
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.160]  hour we will continue with your phone calls and a bunch of news and a key

[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:13.320]  Lucretia in Oregon thank you for holding welcome hey alex who am I I'm an
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:19.280]  info warrior girl well done yeah I finally got you on the road right local
[02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:26.040]  radio station on KMED here after two years of working hard on the the guy that
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:29.880]  owns the station that is awesome you know I was talking to Lisa Lyon the
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:36.320]  producer of coast-to-coast AM and she heard me on that station that's where
[02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:40.320]  you know up in her neck of the woods and she's she likes the station she
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.000]  listens to we're on several there in Oregon tell folks again the call letters
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:50.680]  and the frequency of the fine station KMED 1440 and and sadly you're on at
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:56.200]  night so he broadcast you later six to nine p.m. well it's not sad we're glad
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:01.900]  to be on weekdays and you're on live on on Sunday so that's awesome but yeah I
[02:35:01.900 --> 02:35:06.320]  I gave him over a hundred of the Obama deceptions to give out how was the
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:09.920]  station liking it because we're on so many new AM and FM's getting two or three
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:14.440]  a week that are new and we're talking about all these hardcore issues and the
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:20.640]  stations are loving it I mean but again ten years ago it was like I was a 14
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:25.880]  headed you know goblin but now people can see what we're covering is reality
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:30.120]  really I can see the difference in the colors they're totally waking up it's
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:34.760]  it's awesome so yeah I'm totally stoked about that but I wanted to you know you
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:40.000]  asked about the birds and so I wanted to cover the four main points one is to
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.520]  consider having Lauren Moray on she talks about the dramatic increase in
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:50.080]  earthquakes since harp was put in she also being a whistleblower from Lawrence
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:55.040]  Livermore knows about Gordon McDonald who as you recall was Lyndon B. Johnson
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:59.040]  scientific advisor when Ben Livingston was doing all the mindsoons and she says
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:04.800]  he's a geophysicist that was a part of the technology to set off earthquakes and
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:08.980]  volcanoes but she well I mean I have Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97 in
[02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:13.160]  fact I've got the quote here in my stack I'll pull it out I can find it I've
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:17.840]  covered on coast-to-coast this is real and earthquakes are increasing and
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:21.760]  they're they're behaving like they haven't behaved in the several hundred
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:27.760]  years that the scientists had the seismologists the volcanologists and
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:31.480]  others have been studying it and I got Secretary of Defense Cohen and Army
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:35.360]  Times saying that our government other governments have developed tectonic
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:40.400]  earthquake weapons and just like they laughed at us years ago about weather
[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:44.440]  modification now it's all over the news and they're not just spraying stuff out
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:48.880]  of airplanes they've got these big antenna farms doing it from the US to
[02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:54.520]  the Middle East it's crazy let me get Max Kaiser's take on that well what
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:37:00.800]  about what about the earthquakes that are the industry is putting together on
[02:37:00.800 --> 02:37:05.160]  purpose I'm referring to shale fracking where they're going in and they're
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:09.040]  fracking the crust of the earth to get a little natural gas I'm sure that
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:13.240]  disturbs the earth crust and of course it's a politically correct term they
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:18.400]  don't call it cracking they call it fracking I mean what a joke yeah exactly
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:22.520]  now this is just industry fracking and cracking the earth crust to get a little
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:28.520]  extra cubic the feet of gas to power this industrial monstrosity for a few
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:34.080]  more months just leave the earth crust alone you know stop stop stop fracking
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:38.800]  well we saw that with the deep water horizon a record deep well and I was
[02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:42.960]  studying in many areas of the Gulf of Mexico as deep as they were going is
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:47.440]  how thick the crust is they're going into the mantle yeah well that's what
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:51.160]  that's going to disturb the way you know that's the best the point if you keep
[02:37:51.160 --> 02:37:54.480]  there how many drill dips there are in the Gulf of Mexico I was amazed during the
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:58.440]  B&P crisis there are thousands of these things going in there and screwing around
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:02.520]  I think there's 15,000 plus in the Gulf I mean if you go out there fishing now
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:06.600]  when I was a kid you go out fishing you hardly saw rigs it's now just rigs
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:10.360]  everywhere and and when it's nighttime you see even more because now the light
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:15.640]  standout they're just all over the place and you think about the butterfly
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:21.160]  effect or the lensing effect the map the the megaphone effect what's the
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:25.760]  proper term amplification yes the amplification effect there you go thank
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:30.040]  you max of all of this it's probably untold what it's doing
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:35.040]  Lucretia saying at the beginning of the show the this is a year when mother
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:40.280]  nature finally says go to hell how do we know the globalists aren't launching
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:43.640]  a lot of these weather attacks themselves and then saying oh look at the
[02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:47.800]  weather let us have our carbon taxes by Al Gore another beachfront property
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:54.720]  because the water is rising well because you have to you have to have some
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:39:00.200]  sensitivity as a earth-bound human being to what's happening with mother earth
[02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:06.480]  but you know you just listen to your own body and your own soul cry as you watch
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:11.600]  earth crumble because it's being fracked at death and polluted to death well I'll
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:15.800]  say this I'll say this I mean I don't doubt that the globalist
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:18.040]  who are the globalist they're corporations we're talking about the same
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:22.920]  thing they're just destroying the resources to get the last penny of
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:28.040]  resource out for because they're crazy they're suicidal you know what the best
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:33.640]  book on this is dr. Seuss he wrote a book called the Lorax yeah the last
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:39.040]  Lorax gets cut down yeah yeah but read dr. Seuss is the Lorax and you
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:43.160]  understand what the current situation is if you can't understand a dr. Seuss
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:49.880]  book then haven't haven't helped you dr. Al-Qaeda Seuss he criticizes the
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:54.680]  government I don't like him a Lucretia great job thanks for helping us get on
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:58.480]  that station that's how we're getting on all these great stations and the
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:01.720]  stations are having big success with it and reaching more people and we love it
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:06.600]  Rashid in New York thanks for holding for eons you're on the air with the one
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:11.440]  the only Max Kaiser how you doing Alex first time caller how you doing Max
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:16.440]  well I just wanted to know what you actually think about the call our group
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:21.960]  purchase in a major supplement company called MBTY for three point two billion
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:27.160]  dollars well I've got a comment that's the that's an inside operation they
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:33.080]  know that supplements they know that agriculture metals commodities energy is
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:37.080]  going to be the future as paper currencies and other forms of paper are
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:44.400]  exposed as as being fraud-ridden instruments but but also this is all
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:48.760]  about inside baseball just like the Obama crime syndicate has given over 500
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:53.480]  waivers to select campaign contributors companies McDonald's and others where
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:56.560]  they don't have to get insurance for their employees or if you gave the
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:41:00.480]  Democrats you get to keep your Chevy dealership this is big city Chicago
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:07.920]  mafia merged with the furor precept unitary executive of bushy what a monster
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:13.720]  amalgamation that is and so you're gonna only have select insiders who are
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:18.480]  allowed in the future under Codex Alimentarius that by the way is in the
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:24.160]  House and Senate bill the Food Safety Act admits they selectively get to shut
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:30.000]  down who they want that's the essence of insider baseball comments on that on
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.440]  what Rashid's asking their max well we're talking about a food supplement
[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:39.840]  company and it goes it's part and parcel with this with this idea of
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:45.680]  unnatural synthetic food and replacing natural food you know as you talk about
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:48.760]  on your show all the time that they're cracking down on people growing their
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:53.280]  own food people are not allowed to do the price of natural organic food is
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:57.600]  beyond the reach of most people so company like this that produces food
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:02.120]  supplement it the price is going to continue to go up as people are going
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:07.120]  to be shut out from access to wholesome whole food so this is part of that
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:11.800]  prison mentality you know it's basically prison gruel and this is what they're
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:15.560]  going to be serving the poor prisoners in the casino you're talking about a
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:20.040]  general spectrum I don't know about Carlisle very wicked company buying the
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:23.560]  company you you mentioned I've never heard of it they may just be angel cakes
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:27.080]  and so they got bought because they have a good product I don't know I'm just
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:32.360]  generally looking at who financed the food safety bill it has nothing to do
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:36.560]  with food safety and is codex alimentarious and for years we'd fight
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:40.040]  this we have the official UN documents you're up trying to pass it
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:43.520]  basically where you can't get raw vitamins over the counter you've got to
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:48.880]  get them all adulterated and patent and reformulated by big pharma and it's big
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:54.760]  pharma big you know genetic engineering mixed with the military industrial
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:43:00.200]  complex of the big banks and it's all just a predatory weaponized cancerous
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:06.400]  takeover paradigm Rashid anything else from New York just a prediction for
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:10.560]  2011 a lot of the colleges probably gonna close down in the sense but they
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:14.640]  all close their doors because I guess a lot of people are realizing that there
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:19.600]  are no jobs here and then degrees that basically work with well I mean unless
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:22.640]  it's something like being a doctor or an engineer where you've really got to
[02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:26.680]  have the technicals I feel so sorry for folks that go and get you know philosophy
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:31.640]  degrees and things I mean I don't know I know so many engineers that are
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:38.600]  literally working at Walmart now but then 17-year-old kids that actually know
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:41.320]  how to get stuff done on the internet they're getting paid a lot of money I
[02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:45.080]  mean it just shows that with the acceleration of knowledge what colleges
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:48.920]  are teaching on average is five ten years old I mean when I went and took
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:55.120]  RTF they were literally were teaching me nothing it was like 50-year-old
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:59.280]  baloney about the media system I just went out and found a crack in the media
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:03.960]  and jam myself into it and here we are look shoe leather ladies and gentlemen
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:07.680]  and brains and action and taking action that's how you get things done I
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:11.880]  appreciate your call Rashid and yes the big education bubble we've been talking
[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:15.440]  about that for years max guys are your take on that well yeah I think it's
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:20.040]  interesting reflection of what's going on in the rest of the economy because
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:25.600]  education is becoming a have not and have got so okay the price of an ID League
[02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:29.560]  education is going up and of course the people who can afford to go to those
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:34.400]  schools are finance the children of the bankers on Wall Street and that's really
[02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:38.240]  and max as you know that's really only about getting in with the end crowd so
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:41.720]  that even if you're not from the elite family maybe you can be a secretary
[02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:47.120]  making a million a year and they do on Wall Street because you you know dated
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:50.120]  the captain of the football team at Harvard or Yale I mean it's all about
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:54.600]  being part of the white shoe boys and they teach you for an economics they
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:59.120]  teach you the neoliberal school of economics the Chicago school the Obama
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:02.360]  he's a graduate of that school of economics the mill and treatment school
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:06.600]  and this school of you know the Ben Bernanke is also a graduate of this
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:12.200]  school that teaches you to look at the economy and only see deflation and the
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:16.360]  response is always to pump more money which of course makes the asset prices
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:20.200]  of the people who weathered your education by endowing the colleges that
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:23.800]  you went from the Ivy League rich because their asset prices go up but the
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:28.160]  people who are now deprived of education are getting bankrupted because the food
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:31.560]  and energy that they have to spend 20 or 30 or 40 percent of their after tax
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:35.160]  income on to survive is going up along with those after prices so they're
[02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:41.040]  bankrupted so it's an education system that bankrupts the lower classes and
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:45.440]  enriches the higher classes by making the cost of Ivy League school that much
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:50.560]  higher and by making the access to all education totally indebted and privatized
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:54.560]  like the prison and then that creates a race to the bottom and they're already
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:58.920]  pre-positioning for that in armored government and corporate redoubts where
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:02.360]  the rest of us are basically just hunted down by their hunter killer drones
[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:07.160]  that's not the Terminator movie that's their actual plan with a drone operated
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:11.560]  Skynet I mean these people are completely out of control they talk about
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:22.560]  plus me to another college you need to have the debt kept the pay off and they're offering jobs as a PSA agent down the airport and even off salary that can help you pay off your debt
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:30.040]  you can take whatever copy we have jobs you really want to get maybe in the teacher or something that is more of a title
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:35.000]  that's better but you can't take you gotta take only the jobs that you have to do in prison
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.880]  I'm interrupting you because your cell phone is in a watery position the cell
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:44.520]  phones better than landlines from some reason from from Paris to to Austin
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:48.800]  Texas or I guess this calls yeah going through Austin Texas all right so how's
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:53.440]  that oh no no no now it sounds crystal clear repeat what you just said okay so
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:57.960]  when you graduate from college you got that and that's why I hope it's doing it
[02:46:57.960 --> 02:47:12.200]  again it's driving me insane are you using a hands-free max you're using a
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:21.240]  hands-free plugged into the cell phone aren't you we're just gonna max max we're
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:24.440]  gonna reconnect with you right now okay we're gonna call you right back we'll
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:27.440]  see if we lose him like last week but hopefully we're gonna get this done and
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:31.200]  go into overdrive stay with us we're gonna call max right back because well I
[02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:33.840]  don't have to tell you the problem you hear it it sounds like we're talking to
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:37.800]  him from the bottom of a swimming pool let's go ahead and take another call I
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:41.880]  hope Angelo can just talk a little on me because we're getting max back on or I
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:46.640]  can relay a question to max Angelo in Colorado you're on the air hey what's
[02:47:46.640 --> 02:47:52.080]  up Alex good sir your boy your phone sounds good go ahead hey I just wanted
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:55.560]  to let you know the first of all that when I was in high school and the first
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:00.560]  free a few years in college sorry I'm kind of nervous a little bit but when I
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:05.440]  was a I was study journalism and I really got into that I'd wrote from my
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:10.560]  high school newspaper was a lead lead writer for them traveled the country a
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:13.920]  little bit but I got out of it because I was kind of sick of the bias so I'd like
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:17.840]  to get back into that and if you're never in a time cruncher if you need an
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:21.920]  article written my services are definitely a disposal well my problem is
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:25.200]  we're just a small organization I've got people that understand the new world
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:28.680]  order and then they just write articles and usually I don't even review them
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:32.760]  occasionally I'll just tell them you know there's a typo here because we're all
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:36.600]  moving so quick but I would suggest you just start your own website your own
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:40.920]  blog start doing YouTube videos go buy a $200 video camera that's all you can
[02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:45.560]  afford and start shooting video reports and using fee free video editing
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:49.920]  programs I mean that's what I did I would go out to shoot on like a $200 or
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:56.200]  less camera VHS camera I'd have to edit it on three-quarter inch ancient 1970s
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:00.640]  equipment they had an access TV later they got new equipment but I already knew
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:06.360]  how to use the old stuff I used to hand cut audio tape with a splicer and I'm
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:12.000]  glad I had to do all of that by myself made my films voiced them you know made
[02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:16.040]  the first three or four all by myself the rest was it with a computer at my
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:20.000]  house that took hours to render one minute and so nowadays it's like Buck
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:25.240]  Rogers but I mean just do it do it do it a lot of people say I'm training to be
[02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:28.640]  a journalist I'm getting involved you know right from wrong you're gonna learn
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:33.720]  as you go along just get in the game get involved have your voice be heard now
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:37.480]  you don't have to build and I'm not putting you down Angelo I'm just
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:41.480]  telling you towards you know someday I'm gonna be a journalist I mean you've
[02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:45.760]  got the lady who I've got the article here who lied about a you know aluminum
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:50.200]  tubes and nukes in Iraq criticizing WikiLeaks and saying they're not real

[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:25.800]  the secret to life get yourself a copy Webster's new college dictionary costs
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:31.040]  about six bucks and read the entire thing cover to cover it might take you
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:36.240]  two years but read the entire dictionary this is that that way you give
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:41.120]  yourself an education and you are ready to strike out on your own into the

[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:22.040]  game invisible Empire fall the Republic Obama deception that shatter the
[02:56:22.040 --> 02:56:25.560]  left-right paradigm but it's even more important to get them to listen to the
[02:56:25.560 --> 02:56:30.160]  show so then they'll hear Max Keiser's and Ron Paul's and Jesse Ventura's and
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:36.040]  Stefan Mullinews and you know all these different ideas and and and Alan
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:40.640]  Watt the website of course for Max Keiser is max keiser.com that's max
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:48.640]  keiser.com and he has a show on RT BBC press TV or Saturday morning radio
[02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:54.200]  show on Genesis GCN live.com I mean it's just amazing the output he's doing and
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:57.480]  as we go to the fourth hour I want to finish up with calls and then get into
[02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:02.480]  other issues and things that are on your radar and where you see silver going
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:07.960]  and where you see the economy going but Max specifically more about the
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:12.200]  alternative media the systems coming in now openly saying they want to censor it
[02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:16.840]  and even mainstream news like CTV in Canada is reporting this is a corporate
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:22.640]  takeover of the web they're getting scared. Yeah well do you see that news that came
[02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:25.920]  out I guess the last couple of months that actually they're gonna open up the
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:30.920]  spectrum to a community radio station in the US they're gonna allow communities
[02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:35.640]  now to start up local radio stations. Yeah they always say that though and then
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:42.320]  it's local communism promotion stuff. Well I mean it started out because the
[02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:46.840]  crisis in various communities there was no way to inform people because all the
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:51.000]  local stations were national stations and they had no local way to reach out
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:56.640]  to people so they passed so there's a very aggressive you know radio friendly
[02:57:56.640 --> 02:58:01.840]  people who got this past and they're gonna start giving out local radio
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:07.240]  licenses. Yeah I saw that it needs to be like access TV though on the radio and
[02:58:07.240 --> 02:58:11.440]  not be some kind of fake co-op where everybody's wearing red stars on their
[02:58:11.440 --> 02:58:15.960]  shirts and that means as these license go out good people need to get the
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:20.680]  license at the inception of this and make sure it's a real Liberty message do
[02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:25.320]  you agree Max Kaiser? That's right get look it up now and get in line now so you can
[02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:29.240]  grab the spectrum and you can all launch your free radio local radio stations
[02:58:29.240 --> 02:58:32.560]  this is the greatest thing to happen. Or as long as you don't interfere with anybody
[02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:37.320]  just fire up a powerful pirate transmitter and say New World Order you
[02:58:37.320 --> 02:58:41.720]  want it you guy that's real renegade we'll be right back in 60 seconds with the

[03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:04.840]  you do I was just calling because I'm a swim coach and I could work with little
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:07.960]  kids every day and I just want to say that it's terrible seeing what some of
[03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:10.840]  these parents are doing with their little kids you know as far as nutrition
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:14.880]  goes and as far as the vaccines and the flu shots I've seen little kids come in
[03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:18.160]  you know all excited and running around and happy and then they go get their
[03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:21.840]  vaccines for school and jacked up with these flu shots and they come in and
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:26.000]  literally it's like they're a zombie. Oh yeah mission complete read the insert
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:30.120]  total brain damage the parents love it that they're not responding they're
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:33.360]  walking around so I'm like hey what's up man and these are like six seven-year-old
[03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:36.360]  kids I'm like hey what's going on what's going on and they're just slow and
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:40.400]  apparently oh they're tired today and it's like no man you can't do that well
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:43.960]  I know listen I've known neighbor kids that were happy and everything and they
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:46.880]  got all the flu shots last year and they're just like hello are you there
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:50.840]  and they ain't ever coming back mommy and daddy we've got a little zombie now
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:54.720]  and mommy and daddy like that though they take their kid up like the like the
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:59.000]  Babylonians and the Canites didn't throw their kids into fiery pits to bail or
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.840]  Moloch no now we throw them into fiery brain damage pits and the parents are
[03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:09.080]  just like oh the sacrament oh I'm sorry go ahead they don't yeah no that's
[03:02:09.080 --> 03:02:12.320]  alright they just don't even understand they're not educated and so the thing is
[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:16.000]  our little girl she comes home with a with a sheet and it says you know she
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:19.440]  had to have a list of five vaccines because she doesn't have record of them
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:23.320]  because we never got a vaccine in order to go and listen listen in order to go
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:27.400]  back to school so we're like like five vaccines a girl by the way it's not a
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:32.000]  law it's all color of law there's a waiver for that listen listen so so I
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:35.120]  say so we called it the principal were like you know what's this about the
[03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:38.640]  vaccines we read the law we don't have to do that and they said oh yeah we know
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:43.360]  that we just give it because we want the kids to be vaccinated so I know it's so
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:47.200]  moral and all the schools that got caught last year we gave it even though
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:51.240]  a parent said no oopsie we know best you're like well here's all the rocker
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:54.360]  feller Foundation documents how they're putting sterilants and brain damage in
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:58.760]  chemicals by design oh shut up I'm with the government inject the kids are
[03:02:58.760 --> 03:03:02.880]  having convulsions are like yeah in fact we have that video keep the video for
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:08.920]  kids where where the lady laughs it goes and they inject the kid well it's so
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:14.280]  again there's the pure evil where lying is good for your own good what's your
[03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:20.360]  take on that Max Kaiser I got two points number one the kids should sue the
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:25.800]  parents for pharmacological abuse they can make out like bandits these kids
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:30.280]  should sue their parents there's a lot of lawyers in America that will take on
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:33.240]  these cases and they should go out and solicit these cases they should
[03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:37.120]  advertise on kid shows Saturday morning cartoons to sue your parents for
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:41.840]  pharmacological abuse number two I think a big growth industry in the next
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:47.160]  couple years it can be wrongful birth insurance people are going to sue their
[03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:51.320]  parents for having allowed them to be born in a world where people are jabbed
[03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:55.040]  them with flu shots and that the wrongful birth insurance for something
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:58.200]  like five or ten dollars a month is something that parents are going to be
[03:03:58.200 --> 03:04:02.280]  buying to protect themselves against their children suing them for wrongful
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:07.600]  birth and by the way Max isn't joking about this I mean he's predicted so much
[03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:13.160]  has come true but but going back to Thomas Thomas it's your job to hand out
[03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:18.600]  to all the parents the actual drug insert and explain to them that that even
[03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:22.760]  the British Medical Journal admits that that flu shot doubled their chances of
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:27.160]  getting regular flu for the rest of their life it's destroying their immune
[03:04:27.160 --> 03:04:32.320]  systems and the government is not their friends stop being gullible slugs but
[03:04:32.320 --> 03:04:38.200]  there's your criminality right there the school would lie about this Thomas we
[03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:40.880]  got 20 seconds left you got another question for Kaiser you can answer
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:44.160]  after the break no no just just real quick I just wanted to say as a step
[03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:47.640]  ahead I already got even out of the parents and stuff like that on the
[03:04:47.640 --> 03:04:52.240]  local on the local broadcast channels here they've been playing in game on TV
[03:04:52.240 --> 03:04:55.960]  on Sundays they've been playing it all day long and then playing the 9-11 truth
[03:04:55.960 --> 03:05:02.320]  this is on the public access channel and we'll be right back another offensive

[03:08:07.480 --> 03:08:11.760]  vaccination and I want to know why. Sid I'm Governor Mark Parkinson and I think
[03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:16.640]  I can help kids run a higher risk of getting the H1N1 flu and developing
[03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:21.600]  serious complications that's why the H1N1 vaccination is the best way to keep
[03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:26.840]  you and your community safe and healthy you can learn more at flu.gov. Thanks
[03:08:26.840 --> 03:08:34.560]  Governor see you later scientists. Now that's one of the ads but we have the
[03:08:34.560 --> 03:08:39.160]  actual TV piece where they're like you know the teachers like it might hurt a
[03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:44.920]  little but it'll help a lot and it shows the older kids they induct the little
[03:08:44.920 --> 03:08:49.640]  kid and then he gets to be cool because he takes a shot. I used to have dreams
[03:08:49.640 --> 03:08:55.000]  and think a lot now I'm gonna have an autoimmune response I'm gonna lose a
[03:08:55.000 --> 03:09:00.200]  few million brain cells and be toxic and you'll get cancer it's gonna be fun but
[03:09:00.200 --> 03:09:04.120]  so they don't really tell the kid that it's a chemical weapon Alex has got all
[03:09:04.120 --> 03:09:09.880]  the UN documents posted in full wars.com get ready to be brain damaged kid and
[03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:14.840]  have your IQ reduced and your sperm count drop when you become fertile it's
[03:09:14.840 --> 03:09:20.280]  part of the official UN eugenics program no no no it's like oh sonny get your
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:27.280]  shot here it is we'll go to Max Kaiser.
[03:09:51.280 --> 03:10:02.280]  never mind the UN giving people syphilis never mind the fact I don't give it to you
[03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:22.280]  like the UN giving people lipo it's so much fun
[03:10:22.280 --> 03:10:49.600]  okay in that sweet it's so nice it's so loving Max Kaiser what do you think of
[03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:57.520]  that remember you're never too young to sue your parents you know we sit here
[03:10:57.520 --> 03:11:00.760]  and laugh at this stuff folks but I mean I've pulled it up on air we you can just
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:04.120]  in fact we'll do it live on everybody right now just type in Rockefeller
[03:11:04.120 --> 03:11:12.360]  Foundation developed sterilence and vaccines info wars.com and then we've
[03:11:12.360 --> 03:11:16.840]  got like a 10 part series and then it links directly to the actual documents
[03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:22.160]  from the 60s or we can just type in UN gave live polio to children and you'll
[03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:26.080]  get CBS AP you name it but it's always they don't know why it happened it was
[03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:29.200]  an accident it killed a bunch of them but it happens all over the world over
[03:11:29.200 --> 03:11:35.720]  and over again. Rockefeller Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation sterilize info
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:39.800]  wars.com then it should pop up if not you can call Watson he knows where it's all
[03:11:39.800 --> 03:11:44.520]  out we got so so many articles there it is Rockefeller Foundation article right
[03:11:44.520 --> 03:11:48.200]  there we click on that I'm gonna shut up go back to Max Kaiser Max what are you
[03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:51.760]  thinking Eugenics and the overall population program I mean you're kind
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:55.240]  of saying we've got a toxic environment but is the answer just get rid of all
[03:11:55.240 --> 03:12:01.080]  the people so that the bankers can enjoy the planet for themselves. Well the toxic
[03:12:01.080 --> 03:12:05.400]  environment is caused by corporations and I don't see any differentiation between
[03:12:05.400 --> 03:12:10.240]  corporations and the globalists as you call them I mean the corporations by
[03:12:10.240 --> 03:12:16.480]  are mandated to make a profit and that mandate does not include making any
[03:12:16.480 --> 03:12:22.360]  consideration for the risk that they're taking to the environment or to anyone's
[03:12:22.360 --> 03:12:27.480]  well-being so the problem at the root is that the corporate charter that what
[03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:31.440]  makes a corporation that needs to change for example corporations are
[03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:37.840]  protected under free speech that even though they're making claims that are
[03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:43.680]  ridiculous like these injections are going to be beneficial and they're
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:48.640]  lying they say we're protected under free speech because they say we're an
[03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:51.880]  individual now that's something that they lobby for and that's completely
[03:12:51.880 --> 03:12:56.120]  false that has to change corporations the way the corporations are chartered
[03:12:56.120 --> 03:12:59.840]  needs to completely change there's a state of Delaware or every corporation
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:04.040]  in America virtually is chartered in incorporated in Delaware because the
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:08.360]  laws in Delaware allow for corporations to do all these nasty things first thing
[03:13:08.360 --> 03:13:13.760]  we need to do shut down all the Delaware incorporation that's going on and
[03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:17.720]  until further review force these companies to incorporate in the states
[03:13:17.720 --> 03:13:22.360]  where they do business and the countries where they do business and that would
[03:13:22.360 --> 03:13:26.320]  immediately take away most of their ability to abuse the population in the
[03:13:26.320 --> 03:13:30.000]  name of profit without any accountability profits without any
[03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:35.640]  accountability is abused but it's profits that also phase us out and then
[03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:41.640]  leave them with all of the resources and with air in their lungs total
[03:13:41.640 --> 03:13:45.240]  domination just getting us completely out of the way so these profits are a
[03:13:45.240 --> 03:13:50.360]  means to an end what do you think about the TSA you know the good news is even
[03:13:50.360 --> 03:13:53.560]  Brian Williams the anchor is saying he doesn't like it that he's been groped
[03:13:53.560 --> 03:13:59.200]  Ron Paul all these prominent people are being abused I think they're gonna lose
[03:13:59.200 --> 03:14:03.160]  this fight and what do you think a big sis trying to put and are now putting
[03:14:03.160 --> 03:14:08.640]  nine thousand I've seen the first videos of it going in Walmart but but other
[03:14:08.640 --> 03:14:13.480]  locations not just Walmart's nine thousand locations telescreens where
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:17.760]  government forces its way into your life into the market into the streets with
[03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:21.800]  messages about spying on your neighbor I mean is it that really just about us
[03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:25.600]  spying on each other instead of spying on the corrupt government the real
[03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:32.400]  terrorist well I think the TSA is is clearly an example of submission which
[03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:37.120]  is psychological warfare clearly if they can if you see your neighbor being
[03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:41.200]  sexually abused in public by a government official and you don't do
[03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:45.280]  anything about it they've got you you are now you're submitting to corporate
[03:14:45.280 --> 03:14:49.800]  power and you are never going to be the same and that's what that's all about
[03:14:49.800 --> 03:14:54.360]  as far as spying goes a surveillance somebody somewhere sold the government
[03:14:54.360 --> 03:14:57.720]  on the idea that they could get a discount on buying fifty thousand or fifty
[03:14:57.720 --> 03:15:02.440]  million cameras the government bureaucracy that it is said yeah okay
[03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:05.520]  we'll take that deal never thinking about the consequences there's no
[03:15:05.520 --> 03:15:08.760]  accountability in government there's no accountability in the corporate space
[03:15:08.760 --> 03:15:12.880]  well the corporate guys just pay off the politicians to buy their 50 million
[03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:15.960]  cameras exactly so there's the unfortunately government is now
[03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:20.040]  beholden corporation corporation's been holding to the banks and there's no
[03:15:20.040 --> 03:15:25.240]  accountability there's no transparency yeah I mean I love a mainline
[03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:29.080]  libertarians and anarchist and people with their overall idea of total
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:32.560]  liberty and small government but what they don't get is they always say Alex
[03:15:32.560 --> 03:15:37.200]  don't blame corporations now it's a government but corporations are bigger
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:40.640]  than most governments they have private intelligence agencies they've given
[03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:47.280]  themselves this fiat made up at immunity they are lobbying for big
[03:15:47.280 --> 03:15:51.440]  government to steal our wealth and so I understand the anarchist view well if
[03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:57.080]  you didn't have a big government they couldn't get away with that but I mean
[03:15:57.080 --> 03:16:00.800]  you know regardless I'm glad you said this about libertarians because I'm
[03:16:00.800 --> 03:16:06.160]  more on the same page here the libertarian arguments I find incomplete in
[03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:10.120]  many ways for the reasons you just suggested that we can't give carte
[03:16:10.120 --> 03:16:14.200]  blanche to corporations that repeatedly break the law and like these banks that
[03:16:14.200 --> 03:16:19.400]  get too big to fail they get too big to obey the law effectively plus the idea
[03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:26.160]  of small government is okay as long as you have people obeying the law and not
[03:16:26.160 --> 03:16:31.120]  shrinking the government by getting rid of the laws to govern the corporations
[03:16:31.120 --> 03:16:35.840]  and the people who should be obeying some form of legal construct or
[03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:40.360]  constraint there's gotta be some kind of basic rules even to a wide open game
[03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:44.960]  because the minute you have total anarchy in five seconds a strong man's
[03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:50.040]  gonna get a cache of arms form his army and come in and come in literally play
[03:16:50.040 --> 03:16:55.880]  polo with your skull competition thrives on the rule you know this is what makes
[03:16:55.880 --> 03:17:00.000]  competition exciting for the people who are engaging in the competition is that
[03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:04.360]  they are all abiding by the same rule therefore it's a game that they'd like
[03:17:04.360 --> 03:17:07.920]  to compete in this is something that this government and this Obama
[03:17:07.920 --> 03:17:11.960]  administration doesn't seem to get through their thick skull that by imposing
[03:17:11.960 --> 03:17:16.200]  stricter environmental rules you actually are going to increase competition
[03:17:16.200 --> 03:17:21.720]  increase alternative industries to compete with these entrenched oligarchs
[03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:26.320]  in the oil and gas business more rules fairly adjudicated increases competition
[03:17:26.320 --> 03:17:30.960]  will increase job the idea that the opposite effect is ludicrous and the
[03:17:30.960 --> 03:17:34.840]  proof is in the pudding unemployment skyrocketing America losing its
[03:17:34.840 --> 03:17:40.320]  competitiveness and the kleptocrats running the show but again the mega
[03:17:40.320 --> 03:17:44.720]  banks openly are the progenitors of the carbon tax environmental movement as we
[03:17:44.720 --> 03:17:50.080]  know it their system is only let the megas operate shut everybody else down
[03:17:50.080 --> 03:17:57.520]  through a fake environmental iron fist my solution to the carbon emissions
[03:17:57.520 --> 03:18:06.280]  problem the global warming problem is to let competition rain let let the
[03:18:06.280 --> 03:18:12.760]  alternative energy industry in the alternative sector of the economy but
[03:18:12.760 --> 03:18:17.760]  give them a share shot at competing to know what do you do about mega
[03:18:17.760 --> 03:18:21.880]  corporations always buying up all the new patents about that the answer you
[03:18:21.880 --> 03:18:26.160]  break them up it is it's not anyone in interest in America to have mega
[03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:29.760]  corporations too big to fail banks and make a corporation is running the show
[03:18:29.760 --> 03:18:34.080]  Teddy Roosevelt recognized that he broke them up max we have the coldest winter
[03:18:34.080 --> 03:18:38.480]  in a thousand years I mean I've really interviewed scores of scientists looked
[03:18:38.480 --> 03:18:43.240]  at the history just 200,000 years ago carbon dioxide was much higher than it
[03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:47.560]  is now it's been dozens and dozens something like 50 something times higher
[03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:52.360]  you know in the past I mean just the whole way the environmental movement has
[03:18:52.360 --> 03:18:56.760]  been set up is there a bunch of communists at the grassroots run by
[03:18:56.760 --> 03:19:00.440]  wicked bankers who don't want competition and they're gonna use
[03:19:00.440 --> 03:19:03.600]  environmentalism to shut down all their competition it's the opposite of what
[03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:08.240]  you're saying it is the opposite of what I'm saying I'm saying to encourage
[03:19:08.240 --> 03:19:14.600]  competition regardless of where thoughts are on the global warming debate the
[03:19:14.600 --> 03:19:18.960]  sure no one can deny that oil is dirty and has all these toxic byproducts that
[03:19:18.960 --> 03:19:21.720]  they can't get rid of so they put it in your water saying it's you know a
[03:19:21.720 --> 03:19:26.080]  mineral you know fluoride and all of this I understand all that competition
[03:19:26.080 --> 03:19:28.960]  what you know there's a lot of alternative energies you know a buck
[03:19:28.960 --> 03:19:34.360]  Mr. Fuller invented an electric car back in the 1920s I believe but he was
[03:19:34.360 --> 03:19:41.040]  snuffed out by the three big players Firestone tires Exxon gas and that's
[03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:44.600]  like the tire makers and the car makers openly shutting down all the great
[03:19:44.600 --> 03:19:49.400]  trolleys that had been organically grown by people buying their tickets and now
[03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:54.160]  we're designed for cars art we're sprawled we have to have them because you
[03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:58.960]  now can't set up a transportation bus or train grid that'll work the way we're
[03:19:58.960 --> 03:20:04.360]  set up they've got us the right back Alex told you the government announced
[03:20:04.360 --> 03:20:09.200]  recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of
[03:20:09.200 --> 03:20:13.720]  Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[03:20:13.720 --> 03:20:17.120]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seemed to be
[03:20:17.120 --> 03:20:20.840]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun

[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:05.240]  litigious lot to to to say the least but Max Keiser is our guest we're gonna
[03:25:05.240 --> 03:25:09.240]  take a few more calls and then our final segment with Max we're gonna get more
[03:25:09.240 --> 03:25:12.080]  into some other news items I want to raise another points that he thinks is

[03:25:45.760 --> 03:25:49.360]  just an overall pundit analyzing what's happening I want to get more into
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:52.280]  golden silver and the type of manipulation we've seen today trying to
[03:25:52.280 --> 03:25:56.440]  drive it down that's always in the last few years and followed by even bigger
[03:25:56.440 --> 03:26:01.280]  heights and when he sees it going back up but sunny in Indiana you've been a
[03:26:01.280 --> 03:26:06.760]  real trooper you're on the air with Max Keiser go ahead hi Alex it's so great to
[03:26:06.760 --> 03:26:11.680]  talk to you and thank you to you and Max and everybody in your team you've been
[03:26:11.680 --> 03:26:16.440]  super empowering and inspirational my family and I have been following you
[03:26:16.440 --> 03:26:23.560]  for six years now and I call today I just wanted to let you know about our efforts
[03:26:23.560 --> 03:26:29.360]  in the Info War my daughter is eight years old and we talked about it and
[03:26:29.360 --> 03:26:34.640]  decided that out of all the issues that you cover chemtrails have been the most
[03:26:34.640 --> 03:26:39.200]  obvious everybody can see it you know all you got to do is walk outside and
[03:26:39.200 --> 03:26:46.160]  look up and she decided to make bracelets in an effort to fund the
[03:26:46.160 --> 03:26:51.960]  coalition against you engineering and she has a little Etsy page it's called
[03:26:51.960 --> 03:26:57.720]  blue sky bracelets dot Etsy dot com and I just wanted to let you and your
[03:26:57.720 --> 03:27:02.240]  listeners know about that and hopefully we'll suck your little awareness
[03:27:02.240 --> 03:27:07.560]  absolutely get the truth out sunny and geo engineering that's an I think I
[03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:10.840]  mentioned this earlier with Max I mean they've gone from denying all this to
[03:27:10.840 --> 03:27:14.240]  now we learn governments private corporations they're doing it everywhere
[03:27:14.240 --> 03:27:19.120]  and Bill Gates has bought heavily into it and we know they can manipulate the
[03:27:19.120 --> 03:27:23.840]  weather and Max there's a lot of evidence that they are already engaging in
[03:27:23.840 --> 03:27:27.400]  drought creation and other things we know the CIA has been caught releasing
[03:27:27.400 --> 03:27:34.600]  insects you name it different bacterial or fungus infections and and there's a
[03:27:34.600 --> 03:27:39.400]  lot of evidence that we're under attack here as well not just by government but
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:41.960]  big agribusiness Max Kaiser appreciate the call sonny
[03:27:41.960 --> 03:28:02.760]  I'm not geoengineering is obviously a disaster I mean many people who are destroying the geology and the environment how are they going to come up with the plan to reverse it you know it's ridiculous but let me make a two or three quick point if I might on the trend watch number one
[03:28:02.760 --> 03:28:07.480]  he said you know that is but you know what I would love to know what it is we've got to
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:11.080]  reconnect again for the final segment coming up you've been with us for an
[03:28:11.080 --> 03:28:15.600]  hour now and are over an hour and your phone faded out once now it's doing it
[03:28:15.600 --> 03:28:19.240]  again so we're going to call you right back max with a fresh line because I
[03:28:19.240 --> 03:28:22.720]  want to hear these trends we're not going to get your predictions but your
[03:28:22.720 --> 03:28:29.680]  trends in 2011 coming up and what people can individually do to respond to all
[03:28:29.680 --> 03:28:34.560]  this corruption and there's now a new video out that we've got up on in full
[03:28:34.560 --> 03:28:38.400]  wars dot com and prison punna dot com that I'm really hot to play after Max
[03:28:38.400 --> 03:28:43.640]  leaves us coming up here in about 15 minutes or so I want to play this video
[03:28:43.640 --> 03:28:47.640]  slash audio on air for all the listeners but while we're waiting for Max to come
[03:28:47.640 --> 03:28:54.000]  back let's get John and Georgia on John you're on the air go ahead hello Alex

[03:28:58.440 --> 03:29:03.360]  long-time researcher and first-time caller first of all I wanted to make a
[03:29:03.360 --> 03:29:10.160]  couple of real quick points to Max Kaiser if he's up back on he mentioned
[03:29:10.160 --> 03:29:16.560]  the pollution you know involved with the bird incident and I wanted to just
[03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:20.400]  mention that the biggest polluters in history of course have traditionally been
[03:29:20.400 --> 03:29:26.120]  totalitarian governments and look at Russia look at China I mean it's just
[03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:30.720]  it's classic exactly in the second point was he had advised some young
[03:29:30.720 --> 03:29:35.560]  aspiring young journalist to purchase a new dictionary and I would revise that
[03:29:35.560 --> 03:29:40.400]  to say he needs to buy an 1848 Webster's dictionary and he might get some
[03:29:40.400 --> 03:29:46.280]  accurate what John stay there not only is John cogent and focused and well

[03:31:17.760 --> 03:31:22.000]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[03:31:22.000 --> 03:31:27.240]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention full of the
[03:31:27.240 --> 03:31:31.800]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[03:31:31.800 --> 03:31:36.200]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[03:31:36.200 --> 03:31:39.920]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[03:31:39.920 --> 03:31:43.840]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems
[03:31:43.840 --> 03:31:49.400]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[03:31:55.120 --> 03:32:01.560]  we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV hi
[03:32:01.560 --> 03:32:05.320]  this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[03:32:05.320 --> 03:32:09.200]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a
[03:32:09.200 --> 03:32:12.640]  real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[03:32:12.640 --> 03:32:16.040]  gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[03:32:16.040 --> 03:32:19.840]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and
[03:32:19.840 --> 03:32:24.280]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they

[03:32:56.720 --> 03:33:14.840]  ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survival seed bank dot-com
[03:33:27.480 --> 03:33:33.680]  look we talk about a lot of negative stuff here but that overall is positive
[03:33:33.680 --> 03:33:39.560]  if we don't expose the bad then we can't protect the good and I just want to say
[03:33:39.560 --> 03:33:44.280]  this we have a wonderful planet there are so many good people there are so
[03:33:44.280 --> 03:33:49.320]  many beautiful and wonderful and honorable things in this world my family
[03:33:49.320 --> 03:33:55.000]  is so great my wife my children it is just magic and wonderful how good it is
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:34:01.160]  and that's why I get disgusted and angry at the globalist at the new world
[03:34:01.160 --> 03:34:04.760]  order system because I know they've made decisions to hate their fellow
[03:34:04.760 --> 03:34:09.080]  humankind and to do really bad things I know they've committed crime upon crime
[03:34:09.080 --> 03:34:15.520]  upon crime and I'm tired of them but John and Georgia we got Max back on
[03:34:15.520 --> 03:34:20.440]  another line from France restate your questions quickly and then I want to get
[03:34:20.440 --> 03:34:24.480]  Max's take of the you counter back go ahead okay well I just wanted to make
[03:34:24.480 --> 03:34:27.800]  that point about the dictionary you know he recommended that to an aspiring
[03:34:27.800 --> 03:34:32.320]  young journalist and I would recommend that he get an 1848 Webster's dictionary
[03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:36.240]  and he might have some accurate definitions yeah they have been memory
[03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:39.200]  holding a lot of the definitions but you also wanted to point out that
[03:34:39.200 --> 03:34:43.840]  authoritarian systems always create the worst environments where the Russians
[03:34:43.840 --> 03:34:47.680]  would just throw reactors in a lake communist Chinese their rivers just set
[03:34:47.680 --> 03:34:58.400]  on fire and was that directed at Max I mean absolutely no talent go ahead yeah
[03:34:58.400 --> 03:35:02.400]  no well I mean just talking about it the dictionary immediately opened up a
[03:35:02.400 --> 03:35:06.920]  conversation about the dictionary you know so immediately the knowledge is
[03:35:06.920 --> 03:35:11.080]  infectious so you're saying oh 1848 dictionary okay I will I'm gonna check
[03:35:11.080 --> 03:35:14.080]  it out so this is what we're talking about when you start talking about the
[03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:17.600]  actual words to go into the sentences that go into the paragraphs that go into
[03:35:17.600 --> 03:35:20.600]  the pages that go into the essays that go into the screeds that go into the
[03:35:20.600 --> 03:35:23.840]  Constitution it all starts with words and when you're talking about words
[03:35:23.840 --> 03:35:27.080]  there's a place to go find words most people you talk to today who say oh I'm
[03:35:27.080 --> 03:35:30.400]  a journalist they don't really know much about words and yet words are the
[03:35:30.400 --> 03:35:38.800]  fundamental particle of the journalistic trade so get familiar with words yes
[03:35:38.800 --> 03:35:43.360]  interesting point Max anything else John oh yeah the reason for my call
[03:35:43.360 --> 03:35:49.960]  initially the bird's story I was watching NBC Nightly News last night with
[03:35:49.960 --> 03:35:56.960]  Brian Williams and he they were trying to find all these possible explanations
[03:35:56.960 --> 03:36:00.280]  for these tens of thousands of blackbirds dropping out of the air and I'm
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:04.320]  from Arkansas I grew up there and of course it's one of the greatest duck
[03:36:04.320 --> 03:36:10.480]  hunting states or places in in North America so you know I thought I'd you
[03:36:10.480 --> 03:36:15.160]  know he mentioned what what he mentioned just blew me away he said that well it
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:23.680]  could be fireworks combined with the celebratory Tory gunfire and when he
[03:36:23.680 --> 03:36:28.480]  came up with that I thought wow that's that's amazing yeah all is not is not
[03:36:28.480 --> 03:36:34.000]  Baghdad there is not celebratory fire going on celebratory gunfire that blew
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:38.840]  me away so I thought I'd tell you a story maybe you know a little bit back in
[03:36:38.840 --> 03:36:44.960]  the 1970s I lived on the left coast and I was a manufacturers rep for firearms
[03:36:44.960 --> 03:36:49.240]  manufacturers and one of the companies we represented was Beretta they make a
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:54.120]  very high quality line of high-end shotguns and so occasionally we'd run
[03:36:54.120 --> 03:36:58.600]  across the buyer that we'd want to take back to Arkansas to go duck hunting and
[03:36:58.600 --> 03:37:03.080]  you know I thought to myself oh yeah you know we'd go out in those soybean fields
[03:37:03.080 --> 03:37:07.720]  and we'd pop out of the blinds and fire you know two or three shots because we
[03:37:07.720 --> 03:37:11.560]  had over and unders or plugged you know barrels but you know it didn't it didn't
[03:37:11.560 --> 03:37:14.680]  take much you couldn't miss there'd be clouds of half a million that would
[03:37:14.680 --> 03:37:18.200]  darken the sky and you know one shot would be enough you know the rest would
[03:37:18.200 --> 03:37:21.800]  all die of heart attacks and we'd just be pelted and rained on you know it would
[03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:28.720]  destroy the cars and everything and if you believe that why I just wanted to
[03:37:28.720 --> 03:37:32.800]  comment and say no this this is absolutely insanity that they actually
[03:37:32.800 --> 03:37:38.920]  believe that the American public would accept a story like that well you're
[03:37:38.920 --> 03:37:44.480]  right max what's your take on that well you know look this up I think a lot of
[03:37:44.480 --> 03:37:48.880]  you will find is very fascinating do you remember that show flipper on TV with
[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:55.680]  the dolphin well look I mean I know about let me finish did you remember that
[03:37:55.680 --> 03:37:59.840]  show flipper on TV yeah I thought you're asking a question go ahead yes yeah
[03:37:59.840 --> 03:38:04.400]  okay flipper at the end of his life a lot of people don't realize this but
[03:38:04.400 --> 03:38:10.560]  flipper committed suicide flipper the dolphin committed suicide animals can
[03:38:10.560 --> 03:38:13.680]  commit look it up on Google that you'll find out that flipper committed
[03:38:13.680 --> 03:38:18.760]  suicide animals commit suicide yeah well birds will pull their feathers out and
[03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:22.920]  pick themselves with humans and they're committing suicide they've had it
[03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:27.240]  they're sick of us and they rather kill themselves to live another day with
[03:38:27.240 --> 03:38:31.640]  these disgusting pig human being max let me ask you a question how do the birds
[03:38:31.640 --> 03:38:36.080]  pulverize their organs into liquid blood they're claiming just bumping into
[03:38:36.080 --> 03:38:39.960]  each other would do this I've shot plenty of dove and quail about the same
[03:38:39.960 --> 03:38:45.320]  size as these starlings and let me just tell you when little BB's hit them with
[03:38:45.320 --> 03:38:49.960]  a lot more force than birds colliding nothing turns to mush I just shoots
[03:38:49.960 --> 03:38:54.280]  little holes through them and then you take the breast out and marinate it and
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:58.560]  cook it I mean this is impossible this liquefying of the organs unless they had
[03:38:58.560 --> 03:39:03.320]  a bola and they they don't have any disease this is a real who done it
[03:39:03.320 --> 03:39:08.040]  mystery here what do you think's going on John do you think Alcada did it I was
[03:39:08.040 --> 03:39:12.320]  joking I you know about the gunfire and thinking that they would you know just
[03:39:12.320 --> 03:39:16.600]  masses would dive heart attacks that's just absolutely ludicrous but anyway
[03:39:16.600 --> 03:39:21.560]  what I think did it I think I think the chemtrails are doing it if you want my
[03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:26.120]  honest opinion they're spraying aluminum oxide bury them and strontium into the
[03:39:26.120 --> 03:39:30.440]  atmosphere you can test the snow on Mount Shasta and find it you can test it
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:35.240]  in because that's the water supply for Northern California and you can test it
[03:39:35.240 --> 03:39:39.200]  there's been several places that it's been tested and and of course you know
[03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:42.640]  when they get caught they claim they're not doing it they're just planning to do
[03:39:42.640 --> 03:39:47.120]  it or they say that well you know maybe we're trying to prevent global warming
[03:39:47.120 --> 03:39:51.800]  or whatever excuse they can but you know the real reason you know the real
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:56.080]  motivation is absolutely that they want to do damage to the health of the
[03:39:56.080 --> 03:40:01.400]  average American chicken neck eugenics lunatics like John P. Holdren I mean
[03:40:01.400 --> 03:40:04.880]  they put on TV ads I had an article about this yesterday didn't get to it
[03:40:04.880 --> 03:40:08.920]  where they're now airing other ads where they're blowing kids up in school they
[03:40:08.920 --> 03:40:14.640]  don't accept carbon taxes where where where people are murdered I mean they're
[03:40:14.640 --> 03:40:21.560]  really pumping this anti-human view and and I understand max is angry about real
[03:40:21.560 --> 03:40:26.400]  you know legitimate decadence that's disgusting to all of us but I mean I
[03:40:26.400 --> 03:40:31.000]  think empowering and uplifting humanity is the answer I appreciate your call John
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:35.520]  max what do you see is the big trends in 2011 I mean really getting mining down
[03:40:35.520 --> 03:40:39.040]  in the brass tacks what do you think the best investments are from a max
[03:40:39.040 --> 03:40:44.800]  kaiserian perspective well you know just follow up you know right now in the southern
[03:40:44.800 --> 03:40:50.160]  ocean in Antarctica the sea shepherd which is a group of
[03:40:50.160 --> 03:40:55.760]  conservationists are doing battle against Japanese whalers now they've taken
[03:40:55.760 --> 03:41:01.360]  the fight right to the Japanese whalers on behalf of their clients as they call
[03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:07.280]  them the whale that's the kind of direct action needed to protect the animal
[03:41:07.280 --> 03:41:12.560]  species because the animal species as they as Einstein said about the bees you
[03:41:12.560 --> 03:41:16.200]  know Einstein made a very famous quote about the bee population if the bee
[03:41:16.200 --> 03:41:21.080]  population were to go extinct humans would become extinct within I think he
[03:41:21.080 --> 03:41:24.880]  said something like two or three years and this is what we're talking about the
[03:41:24.880 --> 03:41:28.840]  bees cross fertilize the agricultural products and the Monsanto is never going
[03:41:28.840 --> 03:41:33.680]  to come up with synthetic food to replace the entire ecosystem that's been
[03:41:33.680 --> 03:41:38.840]  a place for millions of years that we rely on for life and direct action like
[03:41:38.840 --> 03:41:42.600]  captain Paul Watson of the sea shepherd in the southern ocean is doing it right
[03:41:42.600 --> 03:41:46.440]  now they've got a brilliant show about this on animal planet that they have
[03:41:46.440 --> 03:41:50.280]  every year now for four or five years they document his fight with the
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:54.800]  Japanese whalers they're taking direct action to defend the whale do we need
[03:41:54.800 --> 03:41:59.040]  to do we need to defend these animals well I do agree that wiping out the
[03:41:59.040 --> 03:42:03.080]  elephants in the whales is abhorrent but then they just get everybody upset with
[03:42:03.080 --> 03:42:09.480]  animal planet and then turn loose the the you know local animal police on you
[03:42:09.480 --> 03:42:15.160]  who come and you know take your dog and euthanize it because it's barking I mean
[03:42:15.160 --> 03:42:21.720]  there's a more sophisticated propaganda going on here yeah I mean like you know
[03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:27.360]  if you look at the individual cells of you know dog ownership and people have
[03:42:27.360 --> 03:42:35.200]  pets and it's the and the city that's divided into various wardens in you
[03:42:35.200 --> 03:42:40.520]  know America that he can't compare that to the ecosystem of the globe and
[03:42:40.520 --> 03:42:45.360]  humanity's history on this globe there's a symbiotic relationship between
[03:42:45.360 --> 03:42:50.120]  people and the environment and you can't synthetically wedge yourself in
[03:42:50.120 --> 03:42:54.120]  between the you and the environment with these synthetic food products and
[03:42:54.120 --> 03:42:59.720]  synthetic intellectual products without causing incredible species why
[03:42:59.720 --> 03:43:05.160]  dangerous situations like we're having now entire species are going extinct and
[03:43:05.160 --> 03:43:10.080]  one of those species is called human the human species is at risk of going
[03:43:10.080 --> 03:43:15.600]  extinct the planet will continue the planet is indifferent to our plight but
[03:43:15.600 --> 03:43:19.560]  if we don't want it if we don't want to stay on this planet we're gonna lose it
[03:43:19.560 --> 03:43:24.240]  because we're just giving the corporations as we say the power to pollute
[03:43:24.240 --> 03:43:29.400]  without any more than pollution make short-term profits to pay them more than
[03:43:29.400 --> 03:43:33.240]  pollution at the end of the year Tiffany's jewelry but they have no
[03:43:33.240 --> 03:43:37.360]  consideration for the general well-being of the population at all it's not a
[03:43:37.360 --> 03:43:40.880]  factor on the balance sheet it's not a factor in their corporate charter it's
[03:43:40.880 --> 03:43:45.160]  not a factor in their annual report they are psychopathic out-of-control
[03:43:45.160 --> 03:43:52.200]  entities that are at war with the natural world and we will not survive if
[03:43:52.200 --> 03:43:56.560]  you've got multi hundred billion dollar corporations at war against our
[03:43:56.560 --> 03:44:02.200]  ecosystem sure max I need to put something in here though I agree with a
[03:44:02.200 --> 03:44:06.200]  lot of what you're saying I mean it's common sense much of it the issue is
[03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:10.680]  they are very intelligent and know that so they've cornered the market and
[03:44:10.680 --> 03:44:14.280]  control the environmental movement and the mega corporations that own the
[03:44:14.280 --> 03:44:21.840]  media spew a environmentaloid version of what you're saying that gives them more
[03:44:21.840 --> 03:44:28.080]  power to divert off into environmental solutions that don't actually fix
[03:44:28.080 --> 03:44:33.280]  anything which you agreed with earlier I mean you understand that that's going
[03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:37.240]  on but my bigger issue is not even so much pollution I don't want to drink it
[03:44:37.240 --> 03:44:41.720]  I don't want to breathe it I know ultimately that it bio accumulates in
[03:44:41.720 --> 03:44:45.240]  Homo sapiens sapien top of the food chain and we're getting people getting
[03:44:45.240 --> 03:44:49.160]  Alzheimer's at 25 I understand this is really bad bio accumulation heavy
[03:44:49.160 --> 03:44:53.960]  metals but the earth can deal with that what it can't deal with is some type of
[03:44:53.960 --> 03:44:57.040]  mishap which the physicists admit could happen with a strange litter other
[03:44:57.040 --> 03:45:01.560]  things with the Hadron superconducting supercollider or with the genetic
[03:45:01.560 --> 03:45:04.640]  engineering I mean those are the areas where I've really done the study and
[03:45:04.640 --> 03:45:09.920]  it's a mathematical probability that the more they do this just open and wildly
[03:45:09.920 --> 03:45:16.400]  the closer we are to not becoming a type one civilization okay well how do you
[03:45:16.400 --> 03:45:22.960]  okay so the issue is how do you avoid becoming like a whack-a-mole situation
[03:45:22.960 --> 03:45:27.560]  because as you know when you can you attack one of these guys they pop up
[03:45:27.560 --> 03:45:31.480]  somewhere else and what I've been saying all along is if you go up the food
[03:45:31.480 --> 03:45:36.400]  chain and you find out who's funding these guys that takes you to the banks
[03:45:36.400 --> 03:45:41.120]  and then you look at the banks and you say well how can we attack the banks and
[03:45:41.120 --> 03:45:46.120]  that's what ended up with the crash JPMorgan buy silver campaign because we
[03:45:46.120 --> 03:45:50.320]  analyzed the situation we said who's funding these new world order corporate
[03:45:50.320 --> 03:45:54.800]  no no no good next we figured out it was the banks and there is one bank that is
[03:45:54.800 --> 03:45:59.760]  particularly vulnerable JPMorgan it's over position and that resonated with
[03:45:59.760 --> 03:46:03.160]  people around the world as you know hundreds of videos have been made people
[03:46:03.160 --> 03:46:06.400]  been buying silver and there's very little of it around there's only maybe
[03:46:06.400 --> 03:46:09.480]  20 billion dollars worth of silver available for purchase which is
[03:46:09.480 --> 03:46:14.720]  fantastically small amount and as my interview on this week's show said
[03:46:14.720 --> 03:46:18.960]  David Morgan for every physical ounce you take off the market you are killing
[03:46:18.960 --> 03:46:26.160]  100 paper ounces on the balance sheet of the bank so that's my thought in terms
[03:46:26.160 --> 03:46:30.040]  of how to cut the head of the snake the head of the snake instead of playing a
[03:46:30.040 --> 03:46:33.800]  whack-a-mole and trying and just saying they're doing this bad and this bad and
[03:46:33.800 --> 03:46:39.800]  this bad they all come down funding from the banks and the best sure maximum I
[03:46:39.800 --> 03:46:43.320]  mean I had you on the show to launch all that but but I mean at the same time
[03:46:43.320 --> 03:46:47.360]  it's good to go after big heads of the Hydra but you've also got to wake up the
[03:46:47.360 --> 03:46:51.840]  general population of the wider paradigm or do you cut off one big head of JPMorgan
[03:46:51.840 --> 03:46:57.040]  Chase if you haven't cut the heart out it's just gonna regenerate another you
[03:46:57.040 --> 03:47:02.280]  know slathering ahead now that you've got to deal with but my thought on that is
[03:47:02.280 --> 03:47:09.080]  what what we lack it are a number are our wins what I would call a win what I
[03:47:09.080 --> 03:47:12.600]  would call you know a touchdown but what do you call the win we blew that fake
[03:47:12.600 --> 03:47:17.680]  carbon credit tax thing out of the water and prove that their whole climate
[03:47:17.680 --> 03:47:20.920]  change thing is a fraud you don't believe that because I think you've
[03:47:20.920 --> 03:47:24.320]  invested in it kind of like and none of us are perfect you kind of believed in
[03:47:24.320 --> 03:47:28.440]  Obama up front I mean maybe max I respect you think you're a smart guy we
[03:47:28.440 --> 03:47:31.880]  all different perspectives but maybe some of us that don't totally agree with you
[03:47:31.880 --> 03:47:38.160]  maybe maybe maybe we got a few brain cells too hmm well the the the win that
[03:47:38.160 --> 03:47:42.480]  I would put in in the column in the last six months would be the TSA scandal
[03:47:42.480 --> 03:47:46.960]  because clearly through public pressure that looks like a big way another
[03:47:46.960 --> 03:47:52.520]  torpedo we launched here on this show thing is another issue but the TSA I
[03:47:52.520 --> 03:47:58.200]  would say is definitely a win the Obama with deception brilliant film you're
[03:47:58.200 --> 03:48:03.000]  right I gave Obama the benefit of the doubt and it turns out that the Obama
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:07.320]  deception film that you made was was dead on accurate the guys have total
[03:48:07.320 --> 03:48:12.200]  puppets of the banking system but I guess I misspoke by saying you don't
[03:48:12.200 --> 03:48:19.040]  have any wins what I'm saying is that it would be nice to take down 150 billion
[03:48:19.040 --> 03:48:23.680]  dollar corporation a major win let's say let's put it that way a big score
[03:48:23.680 --> 03:48:29.400]  because these guys are scoring heavily against us I'd love to see us really
[03:48:29.400 --> 03:48:33.160]  take down a hundred and fifty billion dollar corporation that would give
[03:48:33.160 --> 03:48:38.440]  everyone so much positive energy and it would just get so much momentum behind
[03:48:38.440 --> 03:48:42.480]  that then we can then go after some of these other guys but if we get that big
[03:48:42.480 --> 03:48:47.520]  win Alex I think it would just energize folks sure I totally agree I mean the
[03:48:47.520 --> 03:48:51.680]  TSA thing is a big win because you just showed us we can stand up and say no and
[03:48:51.680 --> 03:48:54.880]  that we're the majority and we have common sense that's just one battle we
[03:48:54.880 --> 03:48:58.560]  haven't won that war I think your silver things a great idea and it's got
[03:48:58.560 --> 03:49:02.760]  titanic legs and it's really scaring the system and I think overall a lot of
[03:49:02.760 --> 03:49:07.120]  positive things are starting to happen max and you know that's why I try to
[03:49:07.120 --> 03:49:10.960]  bring on the Ron Paul's and the Max Kaiser's and the Jesse Ventura's and
[03:49:10.960 --> 03:49:16.400]  countless others and because I see so much understanding so many different
[03:49:16.400 --> 03:49:20.160]  perspectives that together are moving in the right direction doesn't mean we're
[03:49:20.160 --> 03:49:23.640]  all on the exact same page but we're certainly not part of this cold-blooded
[03:49:23.640 --> 03:49:28.920]  corporate globalist dehumanizing Borg we're definitely moving away from that
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:32.720]  together and then having a spirited debate on the way and by the way the top
[03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:41.160]  link on info wars.com just went up there is Max's brand new TV show Kaiser
[03:49:41.160 --> 03:49:45.360]  report Monsanto and the Seeds of Evil and what is that like a 30 minute report
[03:49:45.360 --> 03:49:55.560]  max 26 minutes of exciting television absolutely I mean I'm not saying I'm
[03:49:55.560 --> 03:50:01.960]  not trying to be little any anyone's effort here I'm just saying that when I
[03:50:01.960 --> 03:50:05.960]  see birds falling out of the sky and thousands of fish washing up on the
[03:50:05.960 --> 03:50:10.280]  shore and the bee population going extinct I'm just thinking the timeline
[03:50:10.280 --> 03:50:14.360]  is getting awfully close I mean how close do you want to cut this because it
[03:50:14.360 --> 03:50:19.760]  looks like we're they are telling you max I've done the research they are
[03:50:19.760 --> 03:50:23.680]  trying to cause an environmental collapse to then offer a great green
[03:50:23.680 --> 03:50:29.000]  tyranny on top of it and then they believe they can remake anything in
[03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:33.080]  their image through the genetic engineering I had an IBM person tell
[03:50:33.080 --> 03:50:37.280]  me once that there is no such thing as a genetic malfunction because humans
[03:50:37.280 --> 03:50:40.880]  came from the earth and so we can do whatever we want and then it's part of a
[03:50:40.880 --> 03:50:45.040]  natural mutation because we did it I mean we are in crisis everybody can feel

[03:54:06.040 --> 03:54:11.240]  track 2.3 trillion dollars in transactions that investigations were
[03:54:11.240 --> 03:54:16.200]  needed amazing incredible if you were for the third time today that our
[03:54:16.200 --> 03:54:20.560]  liberties were under attack that the very fabric of our republic was being
[03:54:20.560 --> 03:54:24.880]  ripped apart report suspicious activity and as a nation we turned our back on
[03:54:24.880 --> 03:54:30.400]  our values our principles and our moral obligations we allowed torture we
[03:54:30.400 --> 03:54:36.080]  encouraged war and we slept well as our nation was raped will you tell the
[03:54:36.080 --> 03:54:42.000]  American people to whom you lent 2.2 trillion of their dollars hundreds and
[03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:47.040]  hundreds of banks any bank or that has access to the US Federal Reserve's
[03:54:47.040 --> 03:54:52.400]  discount we tell us who they are no now the day of reckoning is nearly upon us
[03:54:52.400 --> 03:54:57.400]  and still we warn you we're heading for a hyperinflationary depression this is
[03:54:57.400 --> 03:55:02.120]  the madness of a lost society final warnings
[03:55:02.120 --> 03:55:06.360]  well we're heading for hyperinflation the hard choices should have been made
[03:55:06.360 --> 03:55:12.360]  years ago the Federal Reserve is borrowing one hundred billion dollars every 30
[03:55:12.360 --> 03:55:16.800]  days you could cut every penny of government spending except for social
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:21.240]  security and Medicare and you'd still be in Ephesus the end game is everybody
[03:55:21.240 --> 03:55:26.280]  has zero posting power currency there's a scary the orders here the pants off of
[03:55:26.280 --> 03:55:31.440]  you the US will be defaulting on its debt in the next five years because the
[03:55:31.440 --> 03:55:35.520]  numbers are so staggering the world is going to go into a hyperinflationary
[03:55:35.520 --> 03:55:40.400]  depression everywhere we have to have the deficit under control now if we want
[03:55:40.400 --> 03:55:45.280]  to avoid a hyperinflation it's not going to happen and there will be a global run
[03:55:45.280 --> 03:55:50.760]  to hard assets and it's already begun I'm not saying this to scare you quite to
[03:55:50.760 --> 03:55:55.360]  the contrary the government doesn't have the ability to raise taxes to pay for
[03:55:55.360 --> 03:55:59.080]  its needs so what it does is it prints money it gives you inflation eventually
[03:55:59.080 --> 03:56:03.760]  hyperinflation the US dollar becomes worthless I don't want you to prepare and
[03:56:03.760 --> 03:56:08.440]  spare yourself heartache and save your dinner table that's the only reason I'm
[03:56:08.440 --> 03:56:12.520]  telling you these things not to keep you awake at night I contention now is that
[03:56:12.520 --> 03:56:15.960]  we're beyond control we're beyond containment the world has never seen
[03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:19.000]  what they're going to see people ask me as well you know when is it all gonna
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:22.720]  start when the question I ask you to return is what's it gonna take for you
[03:56:22.720 --> 03:56:27.400]  notice is happening there's nothing they can do to prevent hyperinflation here
[03:56:27.400 --> 03:56:34.640]  at a an ultimate economic collapse they know it you leave well America to collapse
[03:56:34.640 --> 03:56:39.040]  I have been told this you're just buying time they're trying to push the bad news
[03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:43.720]  off as far as they can into the future would you like to know exactly what's
[03:56:43.720 --> 03:56:47.440]  going to happen so that you can spare your assets because the fact of the
[03:56:47.440 --> 03:56:52.840]  matter is it's already a rattling the deficit of four to five trillion let's
[03:56:52.840 --> 03:56:57.600]  say the government wanted to resolve the issue of taxes it could raise personal
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:57:01.840]  income taxes to take a hundred percent of individual income it could take a
[03:57:01.840 --> 03:57:06.240]  hundred percent of corporate profits and it's still being deficit if you look at
[03:57:06.240 --> 03:57:10.360]  the price of silver for example the low in silver was around seven dollars an
[03:57:10.360 --> 03:57:14.480]  ounce during the OA crisis silver recently touched $30 there is no
[03:57:14.480 --> 03:57:19.800]  explanation for the move in silver outside of a global move away from the
[03:57:19.800 --> 03:57:23.680]  dollar and that is absolutely happening it's happening right now as interest
[03:57:23.680 --> 03:57:28.160]  rates rise the interest expense goes up causing a bigger deficit causing the
[03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:31.080]  government to borrow more causing the Federal Reserve to do additional
[03:57:31.080 --> 03:57:34.840]  quantitative easing further debasing the dollar and ultimately meaning higher
[03:57:34.840 --> 03:57:38.640]  gold and silver prices the dollar is gonna have a severe sell-off at some
[03:57:38.640 --> 03:57:42.440]  point here a panic sell-off and along with that you're gonna see a sharp spike
[03:57:42.440 --> 03:57:47.320]  in that precious metals as they tend to preserve the purchasing power of the
[03:57:47.320 --> 03:57:51.640]  dollars that go into them the how-to stuff is actually pretty simple you
[03:57:51.640 --> 03:57:57.240]  want to own energy agriculture it's sound money he said get out of anything
[03:57:57.240 --> 03:58:02.480]  that is paper that you realize what that means unfortunately my my experience has
[03:58:02.480 --> 03:58:06.680]  been people won't take simple steps to protect themselves because they can't
[03:58:06.680 --> 03:58:10.320]  imagine the future changing as much as it's going to you've got to make
[03:58:10.320 --> 03:58:15.320]  preparations right now this quantitative easing the official debasement of the
[03:58:15.320 --> 03:58:19.000]  US dollar is beginning to have its effect if you look at the amount of
[03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:23.440]  money that's been created over the last five years to accomplish a 10% gold
[03:58:23.440 --> 03:58:28.320]  that currency the price of gold it has to be around $10,000 an ounce there's
[03:58:28.320 --> 03:58:32.600]  nothing they can do that's going to turn this economy around shy of shutting
[03:58:32.600 --> 03:58:35.600]  down the entitlement system there's nothing they're going to do to prevent
[03:58:35.600 --> 03:58:40.120]  the hyperinflation the madness of a lost society the rest of it is at info wars
