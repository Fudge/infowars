[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  I don't want to believe this. I don't want to be right. I want to be wrong. But I'm sorry.
[00:25.000 --> 00:33.000]  David Rockefeller and the Globalist wrote books and white papers and founded the UN to carry out world depopulation.
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  And for a hundred years, they've been preparing the program. And now they've launched their program against you and your family.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  So on this Friday the 13th broadcast, I'm here to tell you, the Globalists have declared war on us.
[00:45.000 --> 01:05.000]  It's time to declare war on them or get on our knees and die.
[01:05.000 --> 01:24.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  Now, I wouldn't just get this out there up front.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  Even I am super freaked out by what's happening. I knew theoretically the Globalists were planning this.
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  I knew they were planning world government, depopulation, forced inoculations, lockdowns, all of it.
[01:39.000 --> 01:48.000]  We are on target more than anybody else in films, in articles, in videos, hundreds of them, specifically and exactly laying out what happened
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  because the Rockefeller Foundation and others said they would do it.
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  And I'd seen them do a lot of stuff they said they'd do before, so I took them serious and I really thought we could stop them.
[01:58.000 --> 02:09.000]  I thought that this was so diabolical, so out of control, that if we just exposed the Globalist, there would be new countervailing systems that would develop that would challenge it and stop it.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  That has not happened.
[02:11.000 --> 02:18.000]  Sure, the world's waking up. Sure, there's a lot of opposition to it, but because they control the big corporations, because they control the United Nations
[02:18.000 --> 02:25.000]  and the regulatory systems, they are going ahead with this planned planetary depopulation
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  because they've gotten rid of most war, they can't have a nuclear war.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  They believe they've got to be the artificial system in nature that comes in to call the population.
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  And really that's just an excuse for them to take over and totally dominate culture and all the major systems.
[02:40.000 --> 02:50.000]  So you're fighting for your life, I'm fighting for my life, and there's no denial about how dangerous and serious all of this is.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  So whether you want to believe in full wars or not, it doesn't matter now because it's out in the open.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  And I get, as a regular viewer and listener, you're awesome, you understand that, a lot of you are more informed than I am.
[03:01.000 --> 03:08.000]  I'm just asking you again to realize how important you are and to spread the word about this live transmission
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  because you're the only way we break the back of the censors and get past them.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  When you share the live feeds from man.video or m4wars.com.
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  It changes the whole damn world.
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.000]  So I salute you and I encourage you again, however you do it, tell folks about the remote information at m4wars.com
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  and share it via email, via text message.
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  Those are some of the last frontiers where things aren't as censored.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  And keep doing it at Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and everywhere else because that's how this dog hunts.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  You said that a bad job yesterday didn't plug basically in four hours.
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  And every day I do that, we see the Capitol go down and we're barely running in the black right now.
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  I don't want to go back into the red.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  So our charcoal activated charcoal toothpaste is back in stock discounted.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  Our activated charcoal essential oil mouthwash is back in stock discounted.
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  We've got just a few days left on the privacy pouches with 11 free bumper stickers that come with the order for 50% off.
[04:01.000 --> 04:10.000]  That sales about the end. We have the few days left on the vitamin C with the zinc super strong formula.
[04:10.000 --> 04:17.000]  That's 50% off the gummy bears with the high quality vitamin D and calcium that's selling out 50% off.
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  All these are things you need that are essential for your body and your immune system.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  Great for adults, great for children, and they fund the info or so it's a 360 win.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  The only way we lose is if I stopped doing the show and if you stop promoting the show,
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  if you stop supporting us and by the products.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  So we're in this fight together. Thank you all for your support.
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  Please visit infowarstore.com right now and commit to the fight against the globalists.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  We'll get you great products at the same time.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  We'll be right back with incredibly important information.
[04:43.000 --> 04:58.000]  Now spread the word.
[04:58.000 --> 05:06.000]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six plus months of where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[05:06.000 --> 05:14.000]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a best seller within six months and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain, we haven't had it.
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  Finally, it came back in a limited supply.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  Believe me, I'm happy too. It's a great toothpaste and it funds the info or so if you want to get it and stock up on it because you were already a fan or you haven't tried it.
[05:24.000 --> 05:34.000]  It's back in stock at infowarstore.com discounted because of the COVID lockdown because of the globalist siege on small businesses and companies in America.
[05:34.000 --> 05:44.000]  It's been available for over six months, but now it's back in stock and it's available in only two places infowarstore.com and drjonesnaturals.com.
[05:44.000 --> 05:48.000]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[05:48.000 --> 06:13.000]  So get your activated charcoal toothpaste, activated charcoal mouthwash with central oils and more at infowarstore.com and fund the info war a true 360 win.
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  Info wars, the most banned network in the world.
[06:18.000 --> 06:24.000]  It's Friday the 13th, August 13th, 2021.
[06:24.000 --> 06:30.000]  To be exact, I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you from our studios in Austin, Texas.
[06:30.000 --> 06:41.000]  I'll be writing shotgun today with Owen shroyer and other special guests then I will return tomorrow on Saturday with another special emergency report because we're in emergency times.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  And then Sunday, four to six p.m. I'll return as well.
[06:44.000 --> 06:52.000]  Then of course we have Sunday live from six and eight p.m. that comes on after me as well with Owen shroyer.
[06:52.000 --> 07:00.000]  All right, here we are on this Friday and there's so much news breaking and so much happening and we'll go to the other studio at the next segment and lay it all out.
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  But right now, I wanted to hit a piece of news that came out last night because I'm all about victory.
[07:08.000 --> 07:20.000]  I'm picking up and I'm all about leadership in government in corporations in our neighborhoods in our homes in our churches and in our hearts.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  I use the term six months ago of a biomedical tyranny.
[07:25.000 --> 07:33.000]  Now, that's because I went and looked up the legal terms that should be used for a biomedical technocracy takeover.
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  And I've seen that term picked up by others. I don't know if I coined it. I don't care.
[07:38.000 --> 07:47.000]  The point is the attorney general of Missouri, Eric Schmidt came out and was asked by a reporter.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  Is it not time to use fear to get people to take this vaccine?
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.000]  And his answer was absolutely truthful and powerful.
[07:57.000 --> 08:09.000]  What would you say to somebody who says it's a very same thing that we need to use the pressure of someone's fear of losing their job and force them to get vaccinated for the good of the community?
[08:09.000 --> 08:19.000]  Yeah, if someone says that using fear is good, that is what every tyrant in the history of the world and every dictator in the history of the world has ever said to accumulate, aggregate and maintain power.
[08:19.000 --> 08:31.000]  This is America, the freest country in the history of the world. And I don't think that we should be allowing individual politicians who want to grab power and never let go of it, gain it in the first place.
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  People can make their decisions. I believe in freedom. I believe in responsibility.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  But people can make these very important decisions themselves.
[08:39.000 --> 08:50.000]  And I don't want to live in some futuristic, dystopian, biomedical security state. And I'm going to do everything I can as attorney general to protect the rights of individuals in the state.
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  That's the type of president this country needs. If people want to live in communist China or North Korea or other police states, they can.
[08:57.000 --> 09:06.000]  But in America, we don't live in a biomedical tyranny. Plus, the vaccine isn't a vaccine and is dangerous. It doesn't protect our bodies.
[09:06.000 --> 09:22.000]  Now they're saying we need more and more shots. Now they're saying we've got to have all over the United States and leftist control areas like New York City and all of California papers to go to the grocery store, biomedical papers to be able to go to the bar or a restaurant or get your hair cut.
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.000]  And they're threatening to arrest and attack stores and businesses that don't register every customer that comes in.
[09:29.000 --> 09:40.000]  This is admitted by the IMF and World Bank and the private banks that own it. The tool to put in a surveillance global carbon tax grid that tracks and traces all your movements.
[09:40.000 --> 10:01.000]  And Klaus Schwab said five years ago, the end game is an implantable microchip and now Forbes and 60 Minutes and KTLA and hundreds of channels are, oh, there are microchips and they're going to track you for your COVID and you won't have to have a phone anymore to prove you're not diseased.
[10:01.000 --> 10:19.000]  And all of this, again, is based on the fraudulent PCR test. So we are in an amazing moment right now in world history where you have megacorporations that created the United Nations pushing a world ID, a world tracking system beyond any dystopic movie.
[10:19.000 --> 10:32.000]  All the old science fiction movies, you have to scan your hand or scan a chip or scan a phone to buy and sell. This is here. And right now is their globalist revolution trying to impose this on us.
[10:32.000 --> 10:49.000]  So that's why this audience of really informed people is so key because we form the brain trust that is developing the research, the understanding of the globalist takeover to be able to reach out to others and mobilize them to understand what we're facing.
[10:49.000 --> 11:04.000]  A lot of people that are accepting these deadly shots and accepting the internet passports and the social credit scores and the vaccine passports really believe it's about stopping COVID. They really believe it's about, hey, just do this, just comply and you'll get your freedom back.
[11:04.000 --> 11:15.000]  But you notice when you do take the vaccine, they suddenly say it doesn't work and you need more. You still got to wear a mask, still got to show vaccine pass because once they get you trapped in their system, you are a slave.
[11:15.000 --> 11:27.000]  This is simple history. And for those of us that understand that, we can't get mad at people that are dumbed down. They're domesticated. They've lived in freedom so long they've never experienced tyranny so they don't understand what's happening.
[11:27.000 --> 11:39.000]  And that's why this Attorney General, Eric Schmidt, is so important. He's even more hardcore than the governor of Florida who's become a major leader. And the governor of Texas is finally standing up and fighting back.
[11:39.000 --> 11:52.000]  And we need to see more of this from everyone. But before governors and attorney generals and others are going to lead, we're going to have to lead in our homes, in our businesses, in our churches, in our lives.
[11:52.000 --> 12:03.000]  When we see things that are wrong, we're going to have to speak up and say no because it's been our passive stance that has allowed these tyrants to bring in these systems of total control.
[12:03.000 --> 12:11.000]  And so our silence is really a complicit green light for these tyrants to bring in this nightmare system.
[12:11.000 --> 12:19.000]  If you wonder why things have gotten so Orwellian, so Twilight Zone, it's because good people haven't been standing up and saying no.
[12:19.000 --> 12:31.000]  And so the left and all the weird cults and organizations that have signed on to it, the pedophiles, the rest of it, are like a fish that's taken a line and taken a hook and are just running with it, dragging us along with them.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  So it's not till we stand up and pull back and say no, the things are going to get better. But we're seeing more good things happening.
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.000]  Here's an article from Kelly McBrane on infowords.com, underage sex changes labeled child abuse in Texas.
[12:44.000 --> 13:00.000]  The Texas Department of Family Health and Human Services that runs the CPS and sets the policy said, trying to convince someone under 18 to cut their genitals off or take chemicals to block their normal human processing is the delinquency of minors.
[13:00.000 --> 13:11.000]  It is like trying to be a pedophile and have sex with them or trying to give them liquor or drugs. It's the exact same thing, probably even worse than trying to give them drugs to just get them high.
[13:11.000 --> 13:19.000]  That's still bad. This is drugs that irrevocably change their body and stunt their development. So major huge victory there.
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  And there's so many other big victories as well. We're going to be covering here on the show today.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  Owen's coming up next segment, but I'm going to be back with more victories, a whole raft of them later.
[13:30.000 --> 13:37.000]  So it's been said by Mark Twain that a lie goes halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants on.
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  But that once the truth puts its pants on, it kicks the lie in the ass.
[13:42.000 --> 13:49.000]  Here's another big one, video. Child cries in Latin America as she's held down, injected with COVID facts against her will.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  And that's the same system now coming here to America. So get that video and share it with others.
[13:56.000 --> 14:07.000]  So much more is coming up today. And Owen Schreuer later in the hour is going to play a KXAN local TV report that's as hardcore as we are, which is great.
[14:07.000 --> 14:18.000]  More good news, showing the illegals all stacked up like cordwood and cages who are COVID positive being shipped to places like Austin, Texas, where info wars is based.
[14:18.000 --> 14:27.000]  Meanwhile, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the head of ICE are saying illegals cannot carry COVID. They actually said that.
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  They said there is no COVID problem with the illegals. There's only a COVID problem with you.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  Freedom is not a spectator sport. We're going to break.
[14:35.000 --> 14:46.000]  But I'm asking everyone watching to tell everyone, you know, listen to the local AM and FM station, local TV station, spread the word and spread the links from freeworldnews.tv and the links from infowars.com forward slash show.
[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  That's how we override the sensors. You've been doing a great job. Now let's take it to the next level for total victory.
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[15:03.000 --> 15:24.000]  Info wars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[15:24.000 --> 15:33.000]  The great awakening is here. Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[15:33.000 --> 15:43.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[15:43.000 --> 16:05.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:05.000 --> 16:15.000]  Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock. These emergency backup systems provide life saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:15.000 --> 16:24.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:24.000 --> 16:33.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:33.000 --> 16:39.000]  Even better, all this week radio listeners get over $700 in free off the grid bonuses too.
[16:39.000 --> 16:45.000]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[16:45.000 --> 16:56.000]  Look for the free report, crisis cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage. Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[16:56.000 --> 17:05.000]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news. In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:05.000 --> 17:20.000]  Here's the thing, we've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans. These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious and above all with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:20.000 --> 17:31.000]  The best part? We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to, gets even better.
[17:31.000 --> 17:43.000]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world, period.
[17:43.000 --> 17:58.000]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com that's soupbeansurvival.com and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[17:58.000 --> 18:13.000]  So when I first started taking survival soup, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding onto a jaw and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival soup, the X1.
[18:13.000 --> 18:27.000]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it. And man, in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[18:27.000 --> 18:39.000]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[18:39.000 --> 18:47.000]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[18:47.000 --> 18:53.000]  We have to break free of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[18:53.000 --> 19:10.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[19:23.000 --> 19:48.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[19:48.000 --> 20:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:18.000 --> 20:43.000]  What's going on?
[20:43.000 --> 20:52.000]  Can I help you with something?
[20:52.000 --> 20:59.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you for joining us on this live original Friday the 13th broadcast.
[20:59.000 --> 21:14.000]  The globalist are seizing control of every major nation on earth that is under United Nations control with the fear of the COVID virus, which again is a problem they can never defeat because you cannot defeat the common cold.
[21:14.000 --> 21:29.000]  They can have a fancy variant of it so they can have corporate ownership of a new kind miric virus based as a major foundational platform on the coronavirus, but it's now the vaccine itself.
[21:29.000 --> 21:45.000]  The main line scientific journals that is causing the vast majority of illnesses and illnesses that are COVID like serious monies are exploding across the planet. Almost everyone I know has either been sick or has family that's sick.
[21:45.000 --> 22:00.000]  And again, they're calling it COVID, but really it is prion crystals. And now they were attempting to place major roadblocks with internal checkpoints inside the United States, just as they're doing in the UK and Europe.
[22:00.000 --> 22:20.000]  They're calling it HR490 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that any individual traveling on a flight that departs from or arrives in an airport inside the United States or a territory United States is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and for the purposes.
[22:20.000 --> 22:35.000]  So again, it's always about a global medicalizing. On the back of that, they're going to have the global carbon tax system through the smartphones that track everything you do. This is all on record from Clout Schwab.
[22:35.000 --> 22:56.000]  And you can rightly say who died and made Clout Schwab God. Well, he was the former director of the United Nations sustainability project and a Bilderberg group minion. And so he is the spokesperson for the corporate arm of global governance that works through the United Nations.
[22:56.000 --> 23:06.000]  Imagine this system where everything they say is alive. This is not a vaccination. This is not the classic 500-year-old technology of giving you a small part of something so you learn how to defeat it.
[23:06.000 --> 23:19.000]  This is a gene therapy, which they said was 100% to stop COVID. Now they say, well, it's 80%, 60%, 40%, 30%, sorry, you've got to take new shots every few months for the rest of your lives.
[23:19.000 --> 23:30.000]  That was always in the corporate perspectives. That's in the patents. That's in the Bill Gates documents. We covered this all 18 and 19 months ago.
[23:30.000 --> 23:38.000]  And now, thank God, America and the world's waking up because everybody is, I mean, I've been sent this 100 times the last few days. We've covered it, but still people aren't aware of it.
[23:38.000 --> 23:49.000]  And when they do learn about it, they freak out. And you should freak out. It's the Holy Grail of Control, HR 4980, Homeland Security setting up roadblocks.
[23:49.000 --> 24:04.000]  I want to show you some footage here that a man shot in the United States a few years ago. He was driving through the road at night and came across people that were trying to car jack him that had set up cones in the middle of the road.
[24:04.000 --> 24:23.000]  When he saw that they were obviously going for a weapon to try to stop him, he drove through the illegal checkpoint. And this whole UN globalist big farm of power grab through the mainstream media, through big tech censoring is the same thing as people setting up the illegal checkpoint on the side of the highway.
[24:23.000 --> 24:30.000]  Here's that footage.
[24:30.000 --> 24:42.000]  What's going on? Can I help you with something?
[24:42.000 --> 24:59.000]  So when you start seeing all of this for what it is, just an old fashioned hijacking of the media, of big tech, through the big banks, through academia, and through blue state cities and blue state states and other globalist controlled countries around the world, you see it for what it is.
[24:59.000 --> 25:17.000]  An absolute total power grab. Classical C to remember the Texas border is completely wide open border patrol estimated us that by fiscal year in October 31, there will be up to 10 million illegals that have crossed just in to the Texas sector.
[25:17.000 --> 25:29.000]  This is directly from whistleblowers. They've already stopped millions of millions and they're only catching one in four and then being ordered to release them without even having COVID testing, which again shows this is all a fraud.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  The globalists know they're not going to stop people getting sick. That's the whole point. The vaccine is not a vaccine. It makes your body grow prions inside of it.
[25:38.000 --> 25:55.000]  To illustrate this with a real life example of how this is a high set checkpoint. Here's some more footage out of Europe out of France, namely from a few years ago, they've now brought an estimated 8 million quote migrants who are really Islamic invaders into Europe.
[25:55.000 --> 26:17.000]  And here they are cutting down a tree and placing on a highway to get into a truck and to rob. And then here's some footage also in France of individuals hijacking trucks and jumping on them to go into the underground tunnel or the channel into the UK where the UK government also does not deport them.
[26:17.000 --> 26:33.000]  So remember that this is all replacement migration by the United Nations and by the globalists in your face in a major takeover. You don't wake up to it and say no to the pincer attack where they shut down the third world, collapse the third world.
[26:33.000 --> 26:47.000]  The people start starving to death. The United Nations organizes them into refugee camps, gives them the debit cards, gives them the airplane tickets, gives them the Zodiac boat rides, and then literally brings them in as a client group to set up no-go zone, Islamic ghettos,
[26:47.000 --> 27:07.000]  where prostitution, drug dealing, and everything else takes place to, again, collapse Western civilization. The Agenda 2030 being run by Klaus Schwab is an admitted planetary collapse plan to collapse the third world, the first world, and then to only let high-tech city-state reservations operate above the law,
[27:07.000 --> 27:17.000]  tax-free with all the life-assisted technologies or more as we live as slaves either outside of those controlled high-tech zones or within them as digital biometric slaves.
[27:17.000 --> 27:28.000]  You're probably saying I saw that in the Hunger Games movie or the Hunger Games book. Yes, that is people imitating the globalist plan in a fictional book that is not the UN imitating Hunger Games.
[27:28.000 --> 27:37.000]  Those plans have been put down by the United Nations since the 60s and we are now actually living in the operational phase of them launching this system.
[27:37.000 --> 27:49.000]  They developed the computers and all the technology on record to bring in this world government control system and to make sure that handheld computers, they set this back in the 60s, the inventor of the Internet did, would then be directed by the Internet
[27:49.000 --> 28:02.000]  watching you in live time or giving them a type of omnipresence control and that's why you've got to get upset, you've got to get fired up, you've got to say no and reject this entire project of the COVID-19 fear mongering because it's an endless emergency,
[28:02.000 --> 28:11.000]  a permanent emergency that is never meant to end and until you realize it's all a giant fraud and a problem they created that now can never be fixed,
[28:11.000 --> 28:23.000]  they will continue to pose as the saviors and take over society and civilization only a full understanding of the new world order global government paradigm project and the fact that this is 21st century war can free us.
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.000]  What did he just say?
[28:29.000 --> 28:36.000]  He said there's a storm coming in.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  I know.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[28:42.000 --> 29:08.000]  Now we're telling you what's coming and.video.video.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  You probably already believe that.
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.000]  I certainly do.
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  So here's the thing.
[29:17.000 --> 29:26.000]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:26.000 --> 29:31.000]  Now you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com.

[30:00.000 --> 30:03.000]  You're on the air trying to move quicker. Hey Alex, welcome.
[30:03.000 --> 30:09.000]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason in amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year.
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.000]  Okay.
[30:12.000 --> 30:18.000]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  Living defense saved my life.
[30:20.000 --> 30:24.000]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  Living defense brought me back.
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  Just quote from the Bible. Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  This is Matthew 24 verse nine.
[30:33.000 --> 30:42.000]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  That's right where we're at brother.
[30:49.000 --> 30:57.000]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.

[33:01.000 --> 33:29.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:29.000 --> 33:40.000]  All right, my friends, thank you again so much for joining us on this live original Friday, the 13th. It is 1133 central standard time about the hand of a ton over to the rest of the broadcast.
[33:40.000 --> 33:54.000]  The great Owen Troyer. We have a bunch of very important guests coming up today as well. I just wanted to reiterate to everyone out there listening, you are the core of the brain trust and the resistance worldwide to this anti human post industrial world.
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.000]  I salute you and I thank you for your support and I beg you for your sake, my sake and our children's sake and humanity's sake.
[34:00.000 --> 34:08.000]  And because it's God's will that you spread the word about what's really happening like never before because the enemy is out in the open and they're just getting started.
[34:08.000 --> 34:19.000]  As I've said a thousand times submission to tyranny is eternal destruction and death and humiliation and betrayal resistance is obedience to God to quote Thomas Jefferson.
[34:19.000 --> 34:27.000]  So resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. When the government fears the people there is liberty when the people for the government there is tyranny.
[34:27.000 --> 34:38.000]  And this is not our government. This is an illegitimate world corporate UN takeover and we need to rally behind people like the attorney general of Missouri and our governor in Texas is getting better again.
[34:38.000 --> 34:49.000]  Great. And the governor of Florida and others and say no and get them like Senator Paul to come out and expose that it's a UN corporate world government power grab.
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  Notice they for decades said that doesn't exist. Don't talk about it. You're a cook if you do. So when they rolled it out people wouldn't respond to the attack.
[34:56.000 --> 35:04.000]  It's very simple. But the gaslighting isn't working. This is all Claus Schwab Bill Gates agenda 2030. It's out in the open.
[35:04.000 --> 35:11.000]  There are quotes are there. Their admissions are there. This is a crisis that's engineered that never goes away until they go to prison.
[35:11.000 --> 35:23.000]  Australia is literally under martial law. So is many areas of Europe. But then Sweden has zero covid deaths and is totally fine because they're not taking the vaccine in high levels.
[35:23.000 --> 35:32.000]  It's incredible folks. It's now confirmed that the vaccine is in the vaccine is causing almost all the illness and death and is now causing real shedding and real sickness everywhere.
[35:32.000 --> 35:38.000]  And there's no way to escape it except through good health and sunshine and clean water. And there's a lot of scientists we have coming on the show.
[35:38.000 --> 35:46.000]  We had one on yesterday. Top scientists on ways to cleanse your body and detoxify. We're going to be talking more about that because for anything the enemy throws at us.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  God has given us things to fight back. All right.
[35:49.000 --> 36:03.000]  I want to show your text over please now go to free world news dot TV ban dot video info words dot com. However you want to share the link and share that link on Twitter on Facebook on YouTube word of mouth your email your text message
[36:03.000 --> 36:09.000]  and tell folks about those local stations and support those local stations are listening to they are precious.
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.000]  Now I want to show you on the special Friday 13th global transmission from deep in the heart of Texas takes over.
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  Thank you Alex.
[36:19.000 --> 36:25.000]  And we are now live inside the Info Wars World headquarters in Austin Texas.
[36:25.000 --> 36:35.000]  And I'm on Shroyer with you till two o'clock and then who is hosting the fourth hour today guys.
[36:35.000 --> 36:47.000]  Stu Peters with breakthrough news will be hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show and then I'll be back with a ton of other news that I'm just holding off on till I host the war room three to six p.m.
[36:47.000 --> 36:54.000]  And I've got great guests coming up them as well but before I do get into this news that I have here on my desk.
[36:54.000 --> 37:01.000]  And Robert Barnes joins me in the next hour.
[37:01.000 --> 37:09.000]  I want to well let's start with more of the kind of comical spectrum of this and then get to the serious side of it.
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  One of the crew members handed me.
[37:12.000 --> 37:18.000]  I've never heard of Stephen King's book called the stand.
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.000]  But it was first published in 1978 and the plot centers on a pandemic of weaponized.
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  A weaponized strain of influenza that kills the entire world population.
[37:31.000 --> 37:43.000]  A few survivors united in groups establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with one another and it goes on comes out of a laboratory to biological weapon.
[37:43.000 --> 37:54.000]  Everybody has to go into lockdown and so the plot that the globalist plot the secret elite criminal cabal secret society.
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  Illuminati whatever you want to call it plot.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  That at its foundation is a population control eugenics program.
[38:02.000 --> 38:13.000]  I mean do they steal the idea from Stephen King or did Stephen King take the idea from them back in the 70s.
[38:13.000 --> 38:20.000]  Maybe a little bit of both here is a public service announcement.
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.000]  This is from 1976.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  I want you to watch this and listen to this.
[38:27.000 --> 38:32.000]  And if you have the historical knowledge of of this time period.
[38:32.000 --> 38:41.000]  It's even more shocking but I'll tell you that when the clip finishes a public service announcement from 1976.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  Coercing the American people into getting a vaccine.
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.000]  I don't need another flu shot. I had a flu shot last year. A swine flu epidemic may be coming.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  Swine flu shot. Well I don't know. I've been thinking about it.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  It could make you very sick.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  Swine flu. Man I'm too fast today to catch me.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  You'll want to be protected.
[39:04.000 --> 39:09.000]  I'm the healthiest 55 year old you've ever seen. Hey I play golf every weekend.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  Get a shot of protection. The swine flu shot.
[39:14.000 --> 39:23.000]  Now. So there it is the same fear mongering. Oh you better get the shot or you're going to be really sick.
[39:23.000 --> 39:31.000]  And if you know anything about that swine flu shot it was a complete disaster.
[39:31.000 --> 39:35.000]  All kinds of bad side effects. All kinds of injuries.
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  Wasn't effective. It was a disaster.
[39:40.000 --> 39:51.000]  And it's the same thing where the big pharmaceutical companies control the politicians control the media.
[39:51.000 --> 39:57.000]  So they have all of this influence to run the fear campaigns.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  Get you to take a shot. Now it's beyond fear campaigns. They still run the fear campaigns.
[40:02.000 --> 40:08.000]  Now they have the actual tyranny campaigns and they force you to take a vaccine.
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  Or you can't travel. You can't go to a restaurant. You can't have a job.
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  And this is being introduced all over the planet now. There is pushback but it's happening.
[40:18.000 --> 40:26.000]  But again did we not learn our lesson from the swine flu shot. All kinds of legal settlements.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  We didn't learn our lesson.
[40:30.000 --> 40:38.000]  Same fear mongering campaign. Same peer pressure. Media pressure to getting the vaccine.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  Fear pressure to getting the vaccine. And then all the side effects. Total disaster.
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  And we didn't learn anything and now we're doing the exact same thing again.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  Except it's much worse this time. Much much worse.
[40:49.000 --> 40:58.000]  So it's just the same. It's just the same plot. The same simulation. The same mission.
[40:58.000 --> 41:08.000]  This is from the yeah the crew is just pulling up all these cases of the swine flu vaccines and all the settlements and everything.
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.000]  So I mean at the time the swine flu vaccines were the biggest settlements ever for vaccines.
[41:14.000 --> 41:24.000]  It was such a disaster. Then they had to make the manufacturers of the vaccines legally exempt from lawsuits.
[41:24.000 --> 41:32.000]  So total disaster. And then big pharmaceutical companies that make vaccines had so much power and influence over our government and media.
[41:32.000 --> 41:39.000]  They were able to make it so they can make a vaccine and if you die taking it they cannot be held accountable or have any injury.
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.000]  You cannot sue them. They cannot be held liable.
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  So then they got the secret vaccine courts. They got the legal immunity.
[41:50.000 --> 42:03.000]  And now here they are worse than ever pushing a much more dangerous shot for their fear-mongered fake pandemic.
[42:03.000 --> 42:11.000]  And just like in the 70s the media is controlled by Big Pharma and our politicians are controlled by Big Pharma.
[42:11.000 --> 42:22.000]  And we just have to sit here like guinea pigs in an experiment. Sit here like cattle on a ranch and get branded and get herded and pushed around and told what to do.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  And then they go on television and they say screw your freedoms. They go on television and say you're not free.
[42:29.000 --> 42:36.000]  They go on television and they say freedom is too costly now.
[42:36.000 --> 42:43.000]  And I hope that we as Americans are not going to be this stupid.
[42:43.000 --> 42:52.000]  I really hope. So I'm going to get into the news with all these developments coming up. But just don't forget this is not the first time they faked a pandemic.
[42:52.000 --> 43:07.000]  And this is not the first time they've tried to force you to take a deadly vaccine because.
[43:07.000 --> 43:22.000]  Now back at stock just came back in yesterday. Very powerful pure tumor extract tincture. Not a sure immune system.
[43:22.000 --> 43:28.000]  But for inflammation and a lot more and then sold off more than six months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[43:28.000 --> 43:39.000]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with natural peppermint and so much more back in stock from Dr. Jones naturals and the mouthwash with the activated charcoal and essential oils is back in stock.
[43:39.000 --> 43:47.000]  These are great products. They're high quality and they fund the info wars. So thank you all for your support. Check them out today at info wars store dot com.
[43:47.000 --> 43:57.000]  The cell runs for only one week. It is the booster bodies natural defenses super sale and another part of the cell ending is the privacy pouches for your cell phone.
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.000]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[44:02.000 --> 44:09.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[44:09.000 --> 44:16.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield. The X one and it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with that.
[44:16.000 --> 44:27.000]  You know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So I took it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened. You know, I could think again.
[44:27.000 --> 44:35.000]  I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[44:35.000 --> 44:43.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system.
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[44:52.000 --> 44:58.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[44:58.000 --> 45:07.000]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade.
[45:07.000 --> 45:16.000]  And we have this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena. And I just remember thinking about that saying I want to be the man in the arena.
[45:16.000 --> 45:27.000]  But when it comes to media, info wars has been the tip of that spear. But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[45:27.000 --> 45:38.000]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off on all the amazing products. He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[45:38.000 --> 45:43.000]  And then you fund info wars and Mike Lindell and the fight for free speech against the globalist.
[45:43.000 --> 45:47.000]  There's not a better place to spend your money than mypillow.com with promo code Alex.
[45:47.000 --> 45:53.000]  And if you do it, it funds the info war, it funds the election investigation, and it stands up against the globalist bullies.
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.000]  Mypillow.com promo code Alex take action now.
[45:57.000 --> 46:04.000]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say thank you for what you've done.
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.000]  Thank you for keeping info wars on the air. Thank you for praying for us and thank you for spreading the word.
[46:09.000 --> 46:20.000]  If all of you will simply go to infowarstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[46:20.000 --> 46:26.000]  It will remind you every day like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[46:26.000 --> 46:32.000]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalist are predatory and are evil.
[46:32.000 --> 46:38.000]  And in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[46:38.000 --> 46:46.000]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings. They're available at infowarstore.com in four different colors, and they are only $19.95.
[46:46.000 --> 46:53.000]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere. They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the info war.
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the info war.
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:03.000 --> 47:17.000]  Remember the swine flu scare of 1976? That was the year the U.S. government told us all that swine flu could turn out to be a killer that could spread across the nation.
[47:17.000 --> 47:25.000]  And Washington decided that every man, woman, and child in the nation should get a shot to prevent a nationwide outbreak, a pandemic.
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.000]  I don't need another flu shot. I had a flu shot last year.
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.000]  A swine flu epidemic may be coming. Swine flu, man, I'm too bad today to catch me.
[47:35.000 --> 47:43.000]  You'll want to be protected, especially if you're elderly or chronically ill. Get a shot to protect you. The swine flu shot.
[47:43.000 --> 47:53.000]  Well, 46 million of us obediently took the shot. And now 4,000 Americans are claiming damages from Uncle Sam amounting to $3.5 billion.
[47:53.000 --> 48:01.000]  Because of what happened when they took that shot, by far the greatest number of the claims, two-thirds of them, are for neurological damage or even death.
[48:01.000 --> 48:15.000]  This virus was the cause of a pandemic in 1918 and 1919 that resulted in over half a million deaths in the United States, as well as 20 million deaths around the world.
[48:15.000 --> 48:24.000]  Thus, the U.S. government's publicity machine was cranked into action to urge all America to protect itself against the swine flu menace.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  Influenza is serious business. During major flu epidemics, millions of people are sick and thousands die.
[48:31.000 --> 48:42.000]  Well, this year you can get protection. The vaccines are safe, easy to take, and they can protect you against flu. So roll up your sleeve. Protect yourself.
[48:42.000 --> 48:51.000]  One of those who did roll up her sleeve was Judy Roberts. She was perfectly healthy, an active woman, when in November of 1976, she took her shot.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  Two weeks later, she says she began to feel a numbness starting up her legs.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  By the following week, I was totally paralyzed.
[49:00.000 --> 49:09.000]  So completely paralyzed, in fact, that they had to operate on her to enable her to breathe. And for six months, Judy Roberts was a quadriplegic.
[49:09.000 --> 49:16.000]  The diagnosis? A neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome. This disease can even kill.
[49:16.000 --> 49:24.000]  Indeed, there are 300 claims now pending from the families of GBS victims who died, allegedly as a result of the swine flu shot.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  Judy, why did you take the flu shot?
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.000]  I'd never taken any other flu shots, but I felt like this was going to be a major epidemic.
[49:33.000 --> 49:41.000]  And the only way to prevent a major epidemic of a really deadly variety of flu was for everybody to be immunized.
[49:41.000 --> 49:49.000]  As part of informing Americans about the swine flu threat, Dr. Sensor's CDC also helped create the advertising to get the public to take the shot.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  There's only one thing I can think of that hits harder than us.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  What can that be?
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  The swine flu. It can knock you flat.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  So what's the defense for, huh?
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  Like our philosophy. You got to hit it before it hits you. You mean a shot?
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  Yeah. You got yours?
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  You better believe it.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  If swine flu wants to challenge me, I'm ready.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  Oh, me too, brother. Me too.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  Get the swine flu shot. Time is running out.
[50:11.000 --> 50:18.000]  Let me read to you from one of your own agency's memos, planning the campaign to urge Americans to take the shot.
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  The swine flu vaccine has been taken by many important persons.
[50:22.000 --> 50:34.000]  For example, President Ford, Henry Kissinger, Elton John, Muhammad Ali, Mary Tyler Moore, Rudolph Nureyev, Walter Cronkite, Ralph Nader, Edward Kennedy, etc.
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  Did you talk to these people beforehand to find out if they planned to take the shot?
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  I did not know.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  Did anybody?
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.000]  I did not know.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  Did you get permission to use their names in your campaign?
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  I do not know.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  Mary, did you take a swine flu shot?
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  No, I did not.
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  Did you give them permission to use your names saying that you had or were going to?
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  Absolutely not. Never did.
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.000]  Did you ask your own doctor about taking the swine flu shot?
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  Yes, and at the time he thought it might be a good idea.
[51:00.000 --> 51:06.000]  But I resisted it because I was leery of having the symptoms that sometimes go with that kind of inoculation.
[51:06.000 --> 51:15.000]  A man with my government, because they knew the facts, but they didn't release those facts because if they had released them, the people wouldn't have taken it.
[51:15.000 --> 51:20.000]  And they can come out tomorrow and tell me there's going to be an epidemic.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  And they can drop off like flies to me.
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  I will not take another shot that my government tells me to take.
[51:26.000 --> 51:37.000]  Meantime, Judy Roberts and some 4,000 others like her are still waiting for their day in court.
[51:37.000 --> 51:48.000]  So roll up your sleeves. Protect yourself.
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.000]  That's a powerful report from Darren McReen. It only has 63,000 views on Band Out Video.
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  That needs to have 63 million views.
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  Roll up your sleeves. Save.
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  Roll up your sleeve, America. The swine flu fraud of 76.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  1976.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  That brings Channel on Band Out Video. Share that far and wide.
[52:07.000 --> 52:13.000]  And I decided to play that just for more brevity of what I've talked about in the last segment.
[52:13.000 --> 52:20.000]  And I've got all this news and I can get into it, but here's what people just need to understand.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  And I think that they're starting to get it.
[52:23.000 --> 52:28.000]  And you're starting to see doctors go on TV and do interviews on radio and such.
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  And they're just following the pandemic and, you know, they're good people and they're open-minded.
[52:32.000 --> 52:35.000]  And at first they're like, okay, you know, maybe this is a serious thing, this coronavirus.
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.000]  Let's kind of go with the flow here and now we're a year into it.
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  And now they're seeing the vaccines roll out and now they're going on TV and radio shows.
[52:42.000 --> 52:47.000]  And they're saying, you know, if I didn't know any better, I think that they were trying to kill us.
[52:47.000 --> 52:52.000]  If I didn't know any better, I think somebody wants us dead.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, the math is pretty simple.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  They make a biological weapon, the Chinese Communist military in a lab in Wuhan, China.
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  Fauci and Bill Gates overseeing and funding the whole thing.
[53:03.000 --> 53:06.000]  It gets released. They cover it up.
[53:06.000 --> 53:11.000]  It kills millions of people. Okay.
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.000]  Then they come out with the deadly vaccines and force you to take it that cause another mutation of the virus
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  that then they use to fearmonger and control you even more.
[53:19.000 --> 53:26.000]  So, I mean, again, just anybody, neutral observer thinking logically, reasonably, honestly about this
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  is beginning to ask themselves,
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  does my government want me dead?
[53:32.000 --> 53:40.000]  Does my healthcare system want me dead?
[53:40.000 --> 53:46.000]  Is there some sort of secret plot to exterminate me?
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.000]  And so here's the thing.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  And most of this audience probably understands it.
[53:54.000 --> 54:03.000]  But the Info Wars Alex Jones audience is growing every day and new people are tuning in and influential people are tuning in.
[54:03.000 --> 54:07.000]  And it's just time to be real about what's going on here.
[54:07.000 --> 54:15.000]  It's just it's time to just bite the bullet, swallow the pill and just as bad as it may be,
[54:15.000 --> 54:21.000]  like getting a terminal disease or whatever, but you got to admit it.
[54:21.000 --> 54:32.000]  The controllers of this planet, people that believe they control humanity are eugenicists
[54:32.000 --> 54:40.000]  and you are in the middle of a population control operation.
[54:40.000 --> 54:43.000]  And you can look at old government documents like silent weapons for quiet wars.
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  And yeah, that's where you're at too.
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  But it's beyond all that.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  They ran the same operation in the 70s.
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  They ran the same operation in the 1910s.
[54:54.000 --> 55:03.000]  The same power brokers have controlled this planet for centuries, lying to humans for centuries,
[55:03.000 --> 55:10.000]  propagandizing humans for centuries, controlling wars and monetary systems for centuries,
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  rigging the whole planet for centuries.
[55:12.000 --> 55:19.000]  And finally, in the information age now, people are starting to wake up and this is the final straw.
[55:19.000 --> 55:26.000]  So they're either going to get away with this again and it's going to be worse than ever on planet Earth.
[55:26.000 --> 55:35.000]  And you're going to wonder, hey, how come I'm in the year 2021 and 2022 and 2025 and 2030 and everything gets worse.
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.000]  It's supposed to be better.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  I'm supposed to have new technology.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  I'm supposed to be more prosperous.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  I'm supposed to have better things.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  You'll have nothing.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  So people are finally starting to wake up and get it.
[55:48.000 --> 55:56.000]  And it's a fork in the road where you're either falling into deeper Stockholm syndrome,
[55:56.000 --> 56:02.000]  falling into deeper brainwashing and propagandizing and going along with all of this.
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  The masks, the vaccines, the pandemic.
[56:06.000 --> 56:12.000]  Or you're being honest with yourself, you're being a fair observer and you're sitting here a year and a half into this fake pandemic,
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  15 days to slow the spread, and you're finally starting to ask the real questions.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  You're finally starting to think the real thoughts.
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  So I get it.
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  That's an extreme thing to say.
[56:26.000 --> 56:34.000]  There's a secret shadow government controlling the planet, running a population control agenda on planet Earth.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  Yes.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  Yes.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  This is not the first time.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  And if they get away with it again, it won't be the last time.
[56:45.000 --> 56:52.000]  And it gets worse and worse every time.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  So that's what people need to understand.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  And that's why you can't trust the establishment.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  That's why you can't trust the system.
[56:58.000 --> 57:03.000]  Because at its very core is eugenics.
[57:03.000 --> 57:15.000]  At its very core that everything else flows from is that there's too many humans and the population of Earth needs to be controlled.
[57:15.000 --> 57:23.000]  And if you listen to Bill Gates and some of these other people, they even tell you,
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  you want to know what the carbon is that they want to get rid of?
[57:26.000 --> 57:31.000]  You want to know what the carbon footprint is that they want to eliminate?
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  It's you.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  You're the carbon footprint.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  You're the carbon based life form.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  You're what they want to exterminate.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  It's time to be real about this.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  I know it's tough to swallow.
[57:46.000 --> 57:47.000]  That's the reality.
[57:47.000 --> 57:55.000]  I have gotten so many requests and so many complaints from listeners in the last six plus months of where is the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[57:55.000 --> 58:03.000]  We only came out with it a year and a half ago, became a best seller within six months and now because of the COVID lockdowns and the shutdowns and the supply chain, we haven't had it.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  Finally, it came back in a limited supply.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  Believe me, I'm happy too.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  It's a great toothpaste and it funds the info war.
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.000]  So if you want to get it and stock up on it because you were already a fan or you haven't tried it,
[58:13.000 --> 58:18.000]  it's back in stock at infowarstore.com discounted because of the COVID lockdown,
[58:18.000 --> 58:22.000]  because of the global siege on small businesses and companies in America.
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  It's not been available for over six months.
[58:24.000 --> 58:33.000]  But now it's back in stock and it's available in only two places, infowarstore.com and Dr. Jones Naturals.com.
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.000]  It is our activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash.
[58:36.000 --> 58:48.000]  So get your activated charcoal toothpaste, activated charcoal mouthwash with essential oils and more at infowarstore.com and fund the info war a true 360 win.
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  So what's the most important part?
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist.
[58:52.000 --> 58:55.000]  Treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[58:55.000 --> 58:59.000]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor.
[58:59.000 --> 59:07.000]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy
[59:07.000 --> 59:11.000]  that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system, metabolism of a human.
[59:11.000 --> 59:12.000]  Some people get 15 hours out of this.
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  Some people get about eight hours, but people take this.
[59:14.000 --> 59:15.000]  People are taking sports.
[59:15.000 --> 59:19.000]  People cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[59:19.000 --> 59:24.000]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre workouts, their post workouts.
[59:24.000 --> 59:25.000]  You can call us whatever you want.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  It's a total solution all around the best you're going to find.
[59:28.000 --> 59:29.000]  Turbo force.
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  Without you, we don't roll.
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  With you, we search forward together.
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  It's like a bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[59:38.000 --> 59:41.000]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind.
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  It's a win-win 360 together.
[59:43.000 --> 59:50.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  What a time to be alive.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  We have the opportunity to be the human beings that save the planet from a global eugenics prison program
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  that we are currently entering and we're entering the phase of it in which you can never get out.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  And that's why it's so important to fight back against it right now.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  I'm going to be joined by Robert Barnes coming up here shortly.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  The news is so big and I just haven't even been able to get to it yet and I will cover it before the end of the broadcast.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  But here's an example of a victory.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  So you had a couple restaurants here in Austin, Texas that said they were going to do mandated vaccine passports.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  And by the way, this is going on in other states now obviously too.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  In fact, I got kind of a personal story about some friends of mine in St. Louis that run a restaurant and are doing this.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  And let's just say it's not going so well.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  But it's time for other politicians and I do believe Missouri probably has the right ones to fight back against this
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  and follow Florida's lead and follow Texas's lead and follow South Dakota's lead.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  If you have a Republican governor, you've got a chance.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  If you have a Democrat governor, you're pretty much screwed, but these two restaurants, I believe it was just two.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  There could have been some others in Austin said you can't come in without showing your vaccine passport.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  And so this was the response from the Texas Supreme Court, I think is who it was, but the Senate.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Texas warns Austin restaurants that their liquor licenses could be revoked for requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccinations.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  Really, they should go farther than that and say you'll be shut down because now look, here's the thing.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  On a weird level, I could even see the argument being made that yeah, okay, they have the right to do that.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  Now they don't.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  This is an experimental vaccine and it's just out of control.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  They should naturally be out of business.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  But there's even a certain level of me where it's like, hey, the government stepping in here and trying to shut your business down for whatever reason I don't like.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  But hey, the government's already destroying freedom in all these different ways.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  I guess should I celebrate a victory when the government intervenes, but it's actually for a good reason for want for once.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  So really, it should just be there shouldn't even be a liquor license.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Like that's what I'm saying like I'm so anti government, I want them out of everything.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  Government should be able to give you a liquor license or revoke a liquor license.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  Want to sell liquor?
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Go for it.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Why is the government need to be involved?
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  But that's not even the point here.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  The point is to understand that the times were in.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  And to stop this medical tyranny from conquering America.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  So the free market should be able to solve this.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  A restaurant that you go to says, hey, I need to see a vaccine passport for you to eat here.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  You don't go there anymore.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  You tell your friends and family not to go there anymore.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  You stand outside the restaurant and protest.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  That's the free market.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  That's that's free speech.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  That's America.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  But here the government intervenes.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  So is this going to be the way that state governments fight back against restaurants that want to do forced vaccines?
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And here they are saying they're still going to make you wear a mask.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  But they can't make you show proof of vaccination.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Oh, wow, that's too bad.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  The Nazis can't know whether you're a Jew wanting to go eat at their restaurant anymore.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  And if you're a Jew, AKA unvaccinated, well, then you're just not allowed.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  And they're upset because they can't behave like Nazis.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  It must really be tragic for them.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  Robert Barnes is about to join us on a plethora of topics.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  But you know, I'm going to ask Robert Barnes a question that I got asked last night at dinner.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  And that I have people ask me all the time.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  And I've given my response.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  But let's get the lawyer's response on the other side.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  What can you do?
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  What should you do if your boss, where you work is in requiring you to get a vaccine?
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  You say you want to fight tyranny.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  I know you do.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  That's why you're here.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  So I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening right now to understand that there are really two places in the media that don't back down and tell the truth.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  That have great products that are self-funded.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  And that's infowarstore.com with the supplements, the books, the films, the water filters, the air filters, all of it.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  And Mike Lindell and MyPillow.com.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  When you go to MyPillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get the very best deals he's got.

[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  On shoes and beds and sheets and towels and pillows.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  The list goes on and on made right here in America.

[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  Because we're sponsored by patriots like you and we're thankful and we will never back down to the globalist.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  So thank you so much for your support.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  All right, so the leftist death cult, pedophile cult, communist cult is just wide out in the open now.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  Not even hiding anymore.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  Not even trying to disguise themselves anymore.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  They go on TV and say you're not free anymore.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  They have their restaurants as businesses and they make you take an experimental vaccine to work there or go in and have a coffee or a donut.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  And by the way, just like Robert Barnes said before Amy Coney Barrett was put on the Supreme Court.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  That she would be for forced vaccines and for medical tyranny. And it turns out that that is the case Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett turns down requests from Indiana University students to block its vaccine mandate.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  An experimental vaccine, a violation of the Nuremberg code, and Amy Coney Barrett stabbed you in the back again, just like the swamp creature that she is.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  What a shame.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  What a shame. Trump couldn't get one Supreme Court Justice that was actually a hardcore American patriot or a true conservative.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  So we can talk about that with Bob Barnes.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  He's going to be with us for this hour.
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  And so Robert Barnes joins me now.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  But I want to start by asking you this, Robert, because I'm having a lot of people ask me this.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  I was, I mean, people just come up at the gym, I'm at dinner, and they're asking me the same thing.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  So it shows that this is a real issue in America right now.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  Oh, and what should I do if my job requires me to get the vaccine?
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  And my response is always the same.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  Don't quit, don't get the vaccine, make them fire you, but ultimately you're going to have to make the choice.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  You're a lawyer, though, you have the legal background, you've been kind of putting out some advice for this, not legal advice, but just general advice.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  You've been posting it to your website on how people can respond to this very detailed stuff, by the way.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  People can just copy and paste it and send it to their employers if they want on your website.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  But so I'll ask you the question.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Robert Barnes, renowned attorney, legal expert, what should I do if my employer, my boss, the company I work for, is going to force me to take the COVID vaccine against my will to stay employed?
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  The first thing to find out is to get the actual policy, because a lot of these employers are trying to imply that there's been a vaccine mandate by the company, and you dig in and it finds out they haven't actually haven't mandated it at all.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  So that's the first thing, is find out whether or not there's an actual policy in place to mandate it, and then find out what's in that policy.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Because often there's a religious exemption, often there's a medical exemption, sometimes there's a philosophical or ethical exemption, allowed to where, so for example, taking the medical exemption contact.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  If people read the fact sheet that comes with these vaccines currently, they'll see there's people that are identified that they say should not take the vaccine.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Particularly if you have any kind of allergy to any of the ingredients of these vaccines or have previously had allergic reactions to physical shots, because that's how these are done, or allergic reactions to prior vaccines.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  You may be one of those people that even the vaccine companies acknowledge and the FDA admits shouldn't take it.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  So you may have a medical exemption from the vaccine.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  There may be other people that have contraindicated, you may have heart issues, neurological issues, other issues that make it unwise for you to take the vaccine.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  And one of the biggest ones, many doctors are signing medical exemption documents for anyone who has previously had COVID or has the antibodies already in their system, because many doctors, including those who have already attested to this under oath under penalty of perjury,
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  they have said it is a bad idea to get the vaccine if you've already had COVID-19, and many people don't know they had it before because so much of COVID-19 spread asymptomatically.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  So all of those are the potential medical exemptions you may have.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  Then on top of that, you may have religious exemption.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  It's important to note, and there's been a lot of misrepresentations by the companies and employers out there, the way they developed all of the vaccines currently on the market for the United States.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  They developed them by confirming the vaccine in a boarded fetus cell culture, and that's how they use the boarded fetus cells to confirm the vitality of the vaccine.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  To many people, that is a religious objection, because they don't want to be part of medical experimentation that is used and benefited and profited from aborted fetus cells as part of that process.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  Now, some people like Tyson Foods, for example, is telling their own employees that they have no right to religiously object on pro-life grounds, and that's just illegal what they're doing.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  And they're also lying to their employees at Tyson Foods and some other employers by saying, well, there is no aborted fetus cells inside the vaccine itself.
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  That's because they're confusing the issue of how aborted fetus cells were used in this process.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  They're not inside the vaccine. They were used to develop the vaccine, used to test the vaccine, and thus were just as integral and are just as much a grounds for religious objection to this vaccine as any other.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  There's additional religious objections that people have. People have objections to vaccine mandates because it reminds people of the mark of the beast.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  It reminds people that they're attempting to control physical populations against their will using medical experimentation, using gene therapies, which is what many doctors call these.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  They say they're really more like gene therapies than they are vaccines because these are non-sterilizing. These are vaccines that do not sterilize against the disease.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  They do not have the disease to help you protect you against the disease.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  They are an experimental technology that they hope might limit the infectiousness of the disease and they hope might limit the severity of the disease.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  And it's all hope. If you read the fact sheet from the government itself, it says they have no idea how effective this is. They say, maybe it works. Maybe it doesn't.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  Well, and actually they're putting out reports now in MedPage and other medical journals where they're documenting how effective it is.
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  And they're now admitting that no, it's not like the highest effectiveness that they've measured is I think 76%. The lowest is like 25%. And it's on the decline.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  So just like any other influenza, it mutates and the vaccines become ineffective in a year. So they are already admitting that, Robert.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  I just wanted to give a little more context of that, but go on.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  Exactly. Anybody that studied the vaccine industry could have predicted this. Alex Berenson in his book about vaccines on COVID-19 predicted this.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  That the history of mRNA vaccines, the history of influenza vaccines, the history of the vaccine industry writ large is that in this particular context,
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  what was likely to happen, and this is why in the fact sheets, even the FDA, the FDA requires recipients of the vaccine get that requires doctors give to their recipients.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  And a lot of people are not getting these say that they have no idea what the duration of immunity the vaccine can even provide.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  And in this, and why is that? It's because, first of all, this is the first time mRNA has ever been used in any drug or vaccine.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  And the reason why is because in all the prior tests, the more you used mRNA, the less effective it became and the more side effects got worse.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  And so the prediction was that what would happen with this vaccine, these mRNA vaccines especially, is that the effectiveness would, they would quit creating antibodies.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  And that's all really a vaccine is medically just creates antibodies to respond to an infection that the antibodies would decline over time.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  And the problem with mRNA is the more shots you get. The reason why there aren't a bunch of mRNA drugs running around is because the more shots you get,
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  the more you take it, the worse the side effects get. And so you get declining effectiveness and worse side effects.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  So it's a perfectly written disaster movie script. And that's what we're already seeing in Israel, Iceland, UK, the data that was coming out, the vaccine effect.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  Remember they predicted 95% effective. Well, it started going down right away.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  And then it was 84%. And then it was 73%. And now the most recent Pfizer data written by pro-Pfizer people who have connections to Pfizer,
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  the medical report you just mentioned, it's all the way down to 42%. And that's of the Delta variant only being at 70% in the state of Florida,
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  which means it's effective. This is likely, as you know, somewhere around 25% and keeps going down and down and down.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  And this is why it's so frustrating. We got to go to a break here, Robert, but let's pick it back up with where we left off with the religious exemption,
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  which you were in the middle of, and then you can finish off because I know people really want to get this information.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  And you're going to have to bookworm it a little bit. You're going to have to hoop, jump a little bit.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  But, you know, if you don't want to take the vaccine. But again, this is why it's so frustrating is, like, I can sit here.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  I know everything that Robert Barnes is saying is true because I've done it.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  I mean, I remember months ago, the crew printed out like all these different fact sheets and gave them to me from all the different vaccines.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  And it says on it, it literally says, we don't know if the vaccine works. It's on the sheet.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  And then I tell people that and they're like, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  It needs both the regular shows and special reports and share them with everyone you know.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  Take action now by texting the word news, NEWS, to 833-470-0438.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  That's 833-470-0438 for info or emergency news alerts,
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  or text the word show to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  Take action now, rate the chain reaction until others to share those texts.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  This is alerts at 833-470-0438.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Fireplace heat without fireplace smoke.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  It's the world's most versatile pistol accessory.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attack on humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding,
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  Whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  people are really, really awakening the establishment.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  They don't want to go on with the globalist, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  You fund us, you support M4store.com, you get great products at the same time.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular,
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  but the globalist will target you for it to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire,
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  so we can be the shock groups for the information war.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  Fund us at M4store.com.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  Thank you.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  We're back here on the Alex Jones show. Robert Barnes is with us.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  We were cut off by the break and myself just providing some context to what Robert Barnes was saying,
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:24.000]  but I think this is a very important thing.
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  And when I have all these people asking me this question,
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  that means I know that the audience is asking this question to other people and they want to hear from legal experts as well.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  And the question I keep getting asked is, what should I do?
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  What can I do if my employer, my boss, the company I work for is going to mandate the COVID vaccine?
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  And we're seeing this come and it's coming down the track fast.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  And so a lot of people are wondering what to do.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  Robert Barnes went through the medical exemptions in the last segment,
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  started getting into the religious exemptions cut off by the break.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  So Robert, pick it back up where you left off with the religious exemptions.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  And again, folks, the question for legal expert, renowned attorney Robert Barnes,
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  what should I do? What can I do if my employer and or the company I work for,
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  my boss mandates the COVID vaccine?
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  Robert Barnes, pick it up where you left off with the religious exemption.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  Absolutely. So first, you'll get the policy.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  Second, see if you have medical exemptions. Third, look at religious exemptions
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  because aborted fetus cells were used in this.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  There's a lot of people that have religious objections to that.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  There's additional people that have religious objections to what feels like
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  Mark of the Beast kind of revelations kind of policies that are coming out,
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  particularly with the talk of later on making this a chip and a quantum tattoo.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  There's people who oppose the forced aspect of these vaccines
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  and the way it is being used to mark people and segregate people
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  because of certain religious overtones that that has.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  There can be additional religious grounds to object to this particular vaccine
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  that depends on your own religious beliefs.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  And there's letters out there, examples of it.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  There's examples up on my site, which is the Viva Barnes Law.locals.com site
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  that includes exemption letter examples from employees,
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  exemption letter examples from people on religious grounds, legal grounds.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  There's people who get anxiety in response to the risk of this vaccine.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  That can be a medical exemption.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  There's some states that have a philosophical exemption,
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  an ethical exemption that can be asserted.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  For example, in the United Kingdom, they're allowing people to fill out their own exemptions
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  and in certain cases, being a vegetarian turns out to be an exemption.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  So there can be a wide range of exemptions.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  And then the next step is even if you have no religious exemptions,
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  no medical exemptions, and your employer is actually mandating it,
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  not just kind of suggesting it, you can look at reasonable accommodations.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  Your employer should be making accommodations for this.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  And that includes maybe there's the alternative to take temperature checks before you go in.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Maybe there's other, maybe there's COVID antibody testing that can be done
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  instead of the vaccine.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  Maybe there can be COVID testing that can be done.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  And so for some, and I understand some people don't like those tests.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  But for many people, that is a preferred alternative to either losing their job
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  or taking the vaccine.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  So what it comes and maybe you can work remotely,
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  maybe you can work in a part of the building that has low risk.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  So the look at that's all the things your employer should be doing,
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  religious exemptions, medical exemptions,
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  provide in some cases philosophical and ethical exemptions.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  They should not be in quiet.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  You don't have to have a priest or a pastor sign off on it.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  Your religious exemption is I just object on religious grounds, period.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  And they're really not supposed to inquire beyond that.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  Well, you can be a man with your male genitals exposed in a female bathroom.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  And that's okay.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  So yeah, I don't think they should ask you about that.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And this is coming down the pike.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  If it's not already there, folks, it's already happening.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  Alex Jones has called into the broadcast.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  He wants to ask Robert Barnes a question.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  Guys, queue up Alex here live on the air.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  Yeah, guys, I'm just walking around in a store.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  And here's an example of demanding stuff just like the vaccines.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  I'm at a target getting some stuff from my kids and there's literally full of people.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  There's not one human checker.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  It's all people checker themselves out.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  And I went over and I said, I want a human checker.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  And then half the line I was in of 20 people said we want human checkers.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  All these lazy people get out the back and started checking us out.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  And you have to understand once they get rid of humans with robotics and cell checkout,
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  that's going to collapse the whole US economy, the whole world economy, the human economy.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  That's a side issue.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  The reason I called in is I heard Barnes talking about exemptions and getting around it.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  I think that's all great.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Everybody should do that in the areas that are under blue control, under global control.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  But Robert, what about upfront?
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  Just to feed this because it's not even a vaccine.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  It's experimental and it violates the number code.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  What about just stopping the whole thing worldwide instead of just letting them put us in these ghettos of unvaccinated?
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  I mean, I agree.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  It's a two-prong approach.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Religious exemptions, conscientious exemptions, medical exemptions, all that are key.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  What about the two-prong approach of stopping this at the international and national level
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  by putting liability back onto the companies and the media that bully people to do this?
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  There's always a liability protection.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  They give it anything they call a vaccine.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  There's a lot of other ways and places they have liability when they're doing this.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  So what about putting liability back onto the institutions, the companies and schools,
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  try to force this by demanding that they sign a form that they're going to be liable for whatever happens?
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  I just want to hear what you had to say, Robert.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  Thanks.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  Well, exactly.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  So as I say, one additional component everybody should do after reasonable accommodations is ask your employer.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  Have they clarified with their insurer that they will cover and compensate for any injury that the vaccine inflicts?
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  And Robert, this is on the document on your website, right?
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  About the OSHA decision that it's going to be the employer that forces the mandate that's going to be held liable?
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  Absolutely.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  I mean, they can be held liable under their health insurance coverage.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  They can be held liable under their workers' compensation coverage.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  They can be held liable under their liability coverage because really this is kind of a conspiracy to commit battery against individuals.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  So they have major risk and they don't understand this risk.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  And they don't understand the risk because they don't understand the riskiness of this particular vaccine,
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  that it's worst effects maybe over time because we have no idea how this mRNA vaccine will ultimately work.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  So those are all the ways you can approach your employer to try to negotiate a way out of being put into the situation
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  with either your job or the vaccine.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  But as to Alex's point, the other two areas to fight back in are the court of public opinion and the courts of law.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  In the court of public opinion, it matters.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  Even Fox News, when they try to sort of rig the poll results to get as many people for mandates as possible,
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  they couldn't get more than half the country to be for any kind of mandate.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  And if that's where we're at now, we keep hammering away in the court of public opinion
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  and we're going to get a lot of more people on our side and that will be a major restraint on the ability
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  of any of these employers or governments to do any of this nonsense with mandating it in the first place.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  In terms of the courts of law, there's multiple challenges.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  While this is an emergency use authorized vaccine, I believe it violates the federal statute to a mandated period.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Secondly, I believe it violates the Nuremberg Code of 1947 that Alex mentioned,
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  which required informed consent for any form of medical experimentation.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  And clearly this is medical experimentation.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  That's a just Cogan's norm of international law as recognized as the right to sue against piracy.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  I believe it violates in the state and government actor context your constitutional rights under the first, fourth, fifth, sixth
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  and ninth amendments to the United States Constitution and will be bringing claims and claims are being brought all across the country today
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  and next week and the week after on this precise issue.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  I believe the FDA's approval violated the FDA's process.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  Bobby Kennedy and I will be suing next week to try to enjoy the FDA from licensing this period so that it can't go forward.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  And we're bringing suits for employees and others and public against public accommodations because in my view,
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  this violates the Americans with Disabilities Act because this is perceiving that you have a physical limitation that you really don't have.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  They think your immunity is deficient when it's not.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  But that all that matters for ADA is they perceive that you have physical limitation and I believe it's the common law toward a battery.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  So we're going to be bringing all those legal challenges all across the country for people being harmed by these mandates.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  All right. And I do want to focus in on I think what is the overarching issue here and what we've discussed in the last two segments
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  is the most real world approach to this.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Because I mean, yeah, we can talk about how it's experimental and I want to talk about how it's in violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  But it's this weird thing where it's like it doesn't even matter.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  It's just this it's this weird acceptance that we just have to say, OK, it's an experimental vaccine and it's potentially deadly
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  and there's all these side effects.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  But no, you just have to take it even though it's not effective.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  It's really twilight zone level thing.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  And that's kind of the that's kind of a long shot.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  But to me, that's the home run.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  That's the grand slam.
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  Attention, radio listeners, if you're concerned about the coming chaos after the November elections, this will be an extremely important message.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  Here's why, no matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  Here's why this is important.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain waves of social chaos and unstable currencies.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  But did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold?
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  It's true.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  Open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in the coming hard times ahead.

[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  Granny Do Right.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Go ahead.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  Yeah, and first of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  I am a granny and we're all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin was just really gorgeous actually.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements.
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  But I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  This is working.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  This is wonderful.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  And we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  And I just remember thinking about that saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  But when it comes to media, Info Wars has been the tip of that spear, but Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com and use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off on all the amazing products.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  And then you fund Info Wars and Mike Lindell in the fight for free speech against the globalist.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  There's not a better place to spend your money than mypillow.com with promo code Alex.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  And if you do it, it funds the Info War, it funds the election investigation, and it stands up against the globalist bullies.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  So if you go to mypillow.com, promo code Alex, take action now.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  All right, final segment with Bob Barnes here, and it's just so funny to me.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  The story just got published at the Micey's Institute.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  Yet again, the media's COVID narrative doesn't add up.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  It never has added up. Fauci's narratives have never added up.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  The CDC's narratives have never added up. The media's narratives never added up.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  And it's just the frustration of anybody who actually follows the news knowing it's never added up versus the people that just take the loving spoonful that the propaganda agents on television give them.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  That's why they're so duped into believing all of it, but we can go on and on about that.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  So Robert, you got into the, which to me is just more of a real world application for people that don't want to be forced to take a vaccine to have a job, the religious exemption, the medical exemption,
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  and just how maybe, I mean, quite frankly, they can kind of play their hand against the employer and say, OK, are you ready to be held liable?
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  Do you know this is what it says about the vaccine? Get a little tit for tat there.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  But to me, the long shot here, the swinging for the fence is the, you know, 50-yard hook around the tree to get to the green.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  I mean, to me, that's the Nuremberg code. The Nuremberg code's already been written.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  It's already been decided. It's one of the biggest, you know, legal events of all time, you know, from war crimes and crimes against humanity.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  It still exists. We've never said, oh, the Nuremberg code isn't good anymore.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  We've never said that we're not going to, you know, go to that for advice now.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  What about that level of it that this is an experimental vaccine? Fauci is out saying now you're going to have to take booster vaccines for the rest of your life.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  Yeah, Fauci saying that today. So what about the long shot here?
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  What about the swinging for the fences? What about playing the 70-yard hook to get to the green and win the Masters?
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  The Nuremberg code presenting that this is a experimental vaccine and you making me take this as a violation of the Nuremberg code.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  And then if you want, even go a step further and say, do you know what punishment for violating the Nuremberg code is?
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  So what about that aspect of this issue?
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  Oh, definitely. My view is the Nuremberg code of 1947 provided what's called a just Kogan's norm of international law that is enforceable in every court in the world,
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  based on the acceptance of this universal human value, which is the right of informed consent.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  And both of those parts have to exist.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  And the notably when the Biden Justice Department interpreted the statute, the emergency use authorization statute, which codified the Nuremberg code explicitly in the original discussions about it.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  They didn't discuss it when they said, oh, then form consent just means you're informed before you get rate.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  That's not what the Nuremberg code provides for the Nuremberg code requires informed and consent.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  And that means you have to that means there has to be no coercion. That means there has to be no adverse consequences.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  And to give examples of the other organizations, including government organizations who agreed that this is what the Nuremberg code required.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  The FDA has previously said it. The CDC has previously said it.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  The Defense Department has previously said it.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  Various labor government organizations have previously said it.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  They all acknowledge that in particular they often said you could not have an employer mandate this, or you could not have a school mandate this,
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  because it would be a violation of the Nuremberg code of 1947, because this is an experimental vaccine using experimental technology.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  So my view and we're going to be litigating that all across the country.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Can governments do this? Can employers do this? Can places of public accommodation do it?
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  Because if they can, then the Nuremberg code of 1947 is dead. And we're back to the eugenics era of Coromatsu and of Buck and of Jacobson.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  Decisions that were morally horrendous decisions that took us down the path of the Nazis that said the government owned your body.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  And that's why we have to fight back at every single level, court of public opinion, court of law, by every means attainable to us.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  Well, that's the crazy thing about this is I'm not somebody who sits here and just for political debate points or, you know, some sort of influence,
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  like calls everybody a Nazi, like the left has done. And by the way, they've been doing that for years.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  You can go back, watch, they called Bush a Nazi for eight years. So it's really just an old tactic.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  I mean, I'll use it for historical reference, but it's like this is a real thing. This is actually what Nazis did.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  This is actually what Dr. Mangelo was on trial for. Like this is a real thing, the propaganda of Goebbels, all of it.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  And that's just a historical context. And now it's all back. And the people that want to point their finger and call everybody a Nazi are the ones enforcing this Nazi rule.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  But it's like, I don't even want to obsess over the Nazis. They've almost made us numb to it.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  Even though, you know, I guess everybody would say historically, maybe you could argue the Nazis were the worst ever.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Maybe it's the Chinese communists. But let's get back to what's happening now.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  The Biden administration, the Democrats are now proposing you have to have a vaccine passport to even travel domestically.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  They want it on interstates. They want it on airports to travel domestically. Where do you see this going, Bob Barnes?
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  Well, note the irony. I worked with some pilots who pushed back against the airlines and the airlines capitulated this week and recognized that they were not going to require any of their pilots to get vaccinated.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Because a bunch of them are ready to walk off the job, a bunch of them are ready to sue, a bunch of them are ready to quit, a bunch of them are willing to protest it by any means possible.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  And yet we're going to require all the travelers on the airlines that airlines agreed that the pilots can't be forced to be vaccinated to be forced to be vaccinated.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  And by the way, airlines are not a vector of spreading COVID anyway, because their air filtration system gets down to such a low level.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  COVID-19 does not travel on airlines. It has never been a super spreader event. It does not travel at any great degree at all.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  So they're not a risk vector in the first place. And so the idea that we're going to compel this, it's going to be a papers please environment.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  It's going to be papers please to cross the border of a state, papers please to get on a plane, papers please to get on a train, papers please to get on a boat, papers please to travel anywhere.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  And ultimately they're talking about papers please before you can get your coffee at the coffee shop, before you can go to the grocery store to buy essential groceries,
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  before you can even get medical treatment, emergency medical treatment at a hospital.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  California is saying you can't even go visit a loved one in the hospital unless you're vaccinated.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  And so it's amazing. Now, apparently you can party with Barack Obama, it was many people as you want regardless of whether you're vaccinated,
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  but you can't go see your grandmother in the hospital or your child in the hospital unless you're vaccinated.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  And this is in vaccinated from what for what a vaccination that according to the Pfizer's own reports increasingly does not work.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  According to, I mean, if vaccines work, why is Israel, why is Gibraltar, why is Iceland three countries with a very high sky high vaccination levels talking about locking down.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  So we have all the data that this doesn't work to the degree they said it does.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  We have all this data that it has dangerous and perilous side effects. They're tracking excess mortality going up in proportion to countries and states around the world
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  and direct proportion to the amount of vaccination taking place.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  Why is that? Why are the excess deaths being reported by historical numbers precisely when and after vaccination rates go up?
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  So I mean, there's reasons to have doubts about this vaccine. There's reasons to have doubts about the lethality of COVID.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  But more importantly, this is about the right to control your own body and your own destiny.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  And if the government owns your body and the government can put whatever they want into your body, whenever they want directly or indirectly by the coercion of the government itself
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  or by the coercion of your employer or public accommodation, then you don't have any rights at all.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  If you don't control your own body, you control nothing. And that's why this is the legal fight of the century.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  And all of us must do whatever we can to push back in the court of law and the court of public opinion.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  And, you know, if I'm going all the way to the bottom of this pit or the end of this tunnel, this is a eugenics population control program.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  But I mean, at a surface level, this is a mafia shakedown. I mean, that's the craziest thing about this is nothing more at the surface level than a mafia shakedown.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  You can't do anything until you take my vaccine that's not effective, doesn't stop COVID and could kill you.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  And then big pharmaceuticals make out with billions of dollars.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  And so I mean, I guess my final question is when is this COVID vaccine going to be the record biggest health care fraud lawsuit in American history?
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  We already know Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson are they already have the records with tens of billions of dollars.
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  I mean, what's this one going to be 50 billion, 100 billion?
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Well, this is actually the most profitable drug in history. The COVID vaccine is the most single.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  So they will make more money on this single vaccine in a single year than all of the profits from all of the vaccines around the entire world this year.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  So this is the most profitable drug ever. They have no and then they can't be sued.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  They have immunity from suit, the manufacturer, the producer, the distributor, the marketer, the advertiser, the designer, the developer, the doctor, the supplier, all of them are completely immune.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  No matter how bad this vaccine turns out to be.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  So they have no skin in the game in terms of risk and they have lots of skin in the game in terms of reward.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  And that's why we have to fight back.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  And if people want examples of the letters, they can go to VivaBarnsLaw.locals.com and see examples of how they can help fight back to.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  Robert Barnes. God bless. Thank you so much, brother. And you have a great weekend.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  All right, when we come back, I'm going to get into the news headlines and we're going to come full circle on all of this, maybe open up the phone lines.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions, natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system. The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding onto a jaw.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with X2. You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  And man, in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened. You know, I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  And as I beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  We finally got them back in stock the highest rated. They fit almost all types of androids and iPhones at 50% off 1495.

[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  Got a license to kill.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  The big pharmaceutical mafia has a license to kill.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  And you have to understand the paradigm here.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  Like if you have an invasive species in your garden or in your house or like the wild boars and all that stuff.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  Well, what do you do? You terminate that invasive species. You kill it. You kill it.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  And so the globalist and the world elite believe they own the planet. It's their planet and they see you as an invasive parasite. So they kill you.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  They have a license to kill you.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  This is the reality of our planet, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  And I know it's a tough pill to swallow. And hey, you can get away from it for a certain period of time.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  But you cannot let evil exist and metastasize like this or it eventually finds you.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  No matter how secluded of a life you try to live, no matter how off grid you try to live.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  And we shouldn't be forced to live like that.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  And we may have to for a year or two. But I mean, this is about to get real ugly.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  But hey, the big pharmaceutical mafia has a license to kill you and they're legally exempt.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  And now people want to mandate that death. They want to mandate that potential legal injection.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  It's a license to kill.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Coming straight for your heart with blood clots and myocarditis and stroke and everything.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  Because the owners of this planet look at you as an invasive parasitic existence.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  So they're going to exterminate you.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  You better wake up before it's too late.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  By the way, hey guys, I sent you that. I'll come back to that. I'll come back to that.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  But this is actually pretty wild, something I found during the break.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  And if we can find this scientific study, this is like, whoa, level stuff.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  And it just goes back to the whole thing of why are we so unhealthy?
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  We have all this access to information and technology and supplements.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  Why are we so unhealthy by design, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  But let me just do this here. Let me let me just crank out these headlines right now.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  Let me just focus and do this.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Biden's energy idiocracy, kneecap US oil, but beg OPEC to pump more.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  Biden asked Saudi Arabia and OPEC to produce more oil as prices at the pumps rise.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  So Biden as an enemy of the United States of America, blackmailed by China and Russia and other countries,
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  shuts down our energy, shuts down our oil production.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  But now he sees that it's hurting his ratings. And so he wants more oil here,
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  but he's not going to free America to produce more oil, which would bring down our oil prices.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  No, no, no, no, no. He's going to blame OPEC and Saudi Arabia when it's him, Joe.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  And he knows it. But see, he's blackmailed with all the weird sex stuff
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  and crimes that his family have committed and that all these foreign countries have access to.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  So he's not even in control. He's not even in control of his own bowels.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  He's not even in control of his own mouth.
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  And he's not even in control of his own White House.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  So, yeah. And also, you just had the Consumer Price Index
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  and the Producer Price Index reach record levels of increase.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  So you have inflation happening and then you have all the prices going up.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  So your dollar's value is decreasing and the price at the store is going up.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  The price at the pump is going up. All the prices are going up.
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  It's all by design. It's all an act of war by an enemy of the United States of America, Joe Biden.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  I mean, that's incredible stuff. And that's what's going on.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  And understand this. When you see the story about, like this headline,
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  Biden's eviction moratorium is a rare act of presidential civil disobedience.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  No, it's an act of war against America is what it is.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  The Supreme Court will almost certainly strike down the moratorium,
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  but the president's decision to heed the call of Cory Bush was the right and righteous thing to do.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  Oh, really? These dumbass fake liberals that are the dumbest people in the world
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  and don't understand how they're being suckered and duped.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  And are you really so sure the Supreme Court is going to strike this down
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  with the likes of Amy Coney Barrett, who wants you to have a medical experimental vaccine injected into you?
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  I'm not so sure. Here's what this is about.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  This is all very measured stuff, folks. You're in a war.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  And it's not the typical war of one country or one nation state against the other or whatever.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  It's a war of the global criminal cabal mafia that wants to conquer the planet.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  It's globalist versus nation states.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  It's global mafia versus individual freedoms.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  So what's really going on with this eviction moratorium,
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  they're going to price out and destroy all the landlords that they can.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  And it's really happening in New York, the worst in California, the worst right now.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  So the landlords are broke. Nobody's paying rent.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  And the Democrats say, yeah, you don't have to pay rent. Okay, fine.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  Well, I'm never paying taxes. I'm never making another mortgage payment.
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  I'm never paying for this. I'm going to go to the grocery store and just steal everything.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  I guess that's already happening now.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  So that's the universal application of this precedent.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  But you'll never see that because this is the real agenda.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  Once all these landlords go out of business, once all these independent, private,
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  whether it's homeowners or apartment complex owners or development owners, whatever,
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  once they're broken out of business because people don't have to pay rent anymore,
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  guess what? Well, they have to either sell their company, sell their business,
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  go out of business, whatever. And guess what's going to happen?
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  Firms like BlackRock, big globalist hedge funds and Soros and the like,
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  and Bill Gates and the like are going to come in and buy up all of that property
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  and they're going to own everything.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  So the people that tell you you're not going to have any private property by the year 2030
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  are putting all private ownership out of business.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  And this eviction moratorium is the perfect example.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  And again, the fake liberals in this country are such suckers.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  They don't understand how they're being duped.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  They just think they're getting something for free. You fools!
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  I guess that, yeah, you are getting something for free. It's called slavery.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  You're getting free slavery. Congratulations.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  Free imprisonment. Congratulations. Good job.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  So, yeah, you don't want to pay rent? Well, guess what?
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Your landlord's going to go out of business and a big firm like BlackRock
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  that's just buying up all these properties is going to come in and buy up all these properties
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  that you're not paying rent on. And then guess what?
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  It's all going to be vaccines every month just to get into your own building.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  Temperature checks, all of it.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  Chemical castration, physical castration. Yeah.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  Oh, you want to live here? Chop your balls off.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  Oh, you want to live here? Be a part of our experimental medical procedures.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  Whereas the landlord now is just like, all right, here's your place.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  Sign the lease. You're good to go. Don't violate it. Pay your rent on time.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  Okay. Yeah, it's not going to be that. They're going to be spying on you.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  They're going to have cameras in your bathroom.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  They're going to have cameras in your bedroom.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  They're going to be watching you 24-7, measuring your stool samples,
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  making sure, cutting off your energy. That's where this is going.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  That's the agenda. So all of these dumbasses thinking, oh, I'm getting free rent.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  I'm beating the system. No, the system is conquering you.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  The landlord that you're not paying rent to right now is a good person.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  Not out to screw you. Just out to run a business. Well, guess what?
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  They're going to be long gone and Bill Gates and the rest,
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  and they're going to buy up all these places, and they're going to be in your life every day.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  Oh, and you'll pay rent. Yeah, it's called you'll be a slave.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  And they admit it all. And they say, by the year 2030, you have no private property.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  And they have operation 2030 because all these big, all these big events
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  have all the globalist propaganda in them.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  So you had at the opening ceremony for the Olympics this year,
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  you had the 2030 agenda logo in the opening Olympics.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  They don't even hide it. Kind of like how in the London Olympics,
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  they had Boris Johnson and all the visual, subliminal messaging
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  and propaganda that they were about to do a pandemic.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  And you had all the people in the hospital beds and Boris Johnson
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  walking over it at the London Olympics. They knew it was all coming.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  And now they're doing the same thing. So, yeah.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  Oh, you don't have to pay rent and then the landlords go out of business
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  and then BlackRock and the globalists buy all the properties
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  and then you become a slave of these people.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  And you think you've won. You think you got over on the system by not paying rent you fools.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  You're being crushed. You're being enslaved.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  By the way, they have all these new capital gains taxes
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  so that you can't make any money in cryptocurrency.
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  How come if I lose money, the government doesn't pay me?
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  What about that? For only one week, we're running
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  Boost Your Body's Natural Defenses Supercell.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  And we have the vitamin D3 gummies with calcium.

[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  Very powerful, pure tumor extract.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  Tincture, not necessarily immune system, but for inflammation and a lot more.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  And then sold out for more than six months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  We finally have the activated charcoal toothpaste with natural peppermint
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  and so much more back in stock from Dr. Jones Naturals
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  and the mouthwash with the activated charcoal and essential oils is back in stock.
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  These are great products. They're high quality and they fund the InfoWars.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  So thank you all for your support. Check them out today at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  The sale runs for only one week.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  It is the Boost Your Body's Natural Defenses Supercell.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  And another part of the sale ending is the privacy pouches for your cell phone.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  This is globalists that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with ACT
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  that would actually go attack the telenphecytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system,
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:47.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:53.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:59:53.000 --> 1:59:55.000]  Let's go.
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  And then they show you their propaganda at the opening ceremony of the Olympics,
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  the exact logo of Operation 2030, which is no individual freedoms, no individual ownership anymore.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  Yeah, so, you know, oh, you can't have a gun in your apartment.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  Oh, now they've just disarmed you through fiat. See how that works?
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  See how that works?
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  It's really just incredible to be witnessing all of this
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  and how people can be so suckered into it.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  But yeah, I guess we're just getting dumber with time.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  Kind of like this study that just came out.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  Study finds children born during lockdown have lost IQ points and paired cognitive functioning.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  Well, of course, they're not going to school anymore.
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  They're living in a fake pandemic, a big lie.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  So, of course, they're going to be dumber.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  And they get the fluoride in the water and the chemicals in the food.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  And yeah, it's all to make you dumb so that when the globalist,
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  the global mafia leads you to the slaughterhouse, you don't question anything.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  And it's also like this weird creation of a justification to kill you.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  Hey, you're a dumb parasite. You don't even realize you're being murdered.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  So, you know what? You deserve to die.
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  Or, you know what? We need to dumb humanity down so when we kill them, it's not so brutal.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  It's not so bloody.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:49.000]  By the way, just found out Michael Graves, a frequent guest with me on the war room,
[2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  who's actually already scheduled to be on the war room with me today,
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  launched a founding member of the Misfits.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  They kicked him out for his politics.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  A fabulous musician, by the way.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  And he just launched a tour.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  It's been tough for him to get back on the road with, you know, all the politicization of everything.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  And he announces a tour and he's already having venues cancel his shows because he's a conservative.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  And by the way, Michael Graves is not going to back down.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  He doesn't have to come on info wars every month or, you know, do segments with me all the time,
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  knowing that it'll, he could hurt his career.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  He doesn't care. He cares more about freedom and truth.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  So, Michael Graves having shows canceled because he's a conservative.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  And they don't even hide it. They just say, oh, you're a conservative.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  And that's what they'll do.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  Most of the globalists own all the property. They won't even let you rent because of your politics.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  Or they'll make you go to reeducation camps just to, just to live in their apartments that they own.
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  So Michael Graves will be on the war room today at five o'clock.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  And I'll obviously be discussing that with him.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  Yeah. You know, hey, there's no such thing as freedom anymore.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  The left is telling you you're not free.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  So, I mean, we shouldn't be surprised by all this.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  They've told us that you're not free anymore.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  They've been telling us for a year and a half, you're not free anymore.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  Now they just go on TV. They go on CNN, they go on MSNBC, Hollywood people.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  And they say, you're not free. Screw your freedoms.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  You're our property now.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Man, oh man, let me just continue on with these headlines.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  Joe Biden during a press conference says this isn't about politics.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  This is about keeping our kids safe.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  Biden condemns anti-mass protests and praises doctors, teachers and mayors who are battling governors over school mask mandates.
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  Even though all the studies that have come out about schools mandating masks for children actually show that the mask is bad.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  All the studies, every single one.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  And now you're having outbreaks of, I think it's RSV.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  I think what it is, guys, plug in RSV Louisiana.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  I forget what the story was, but basically there's this new, well, it's not new, but there's an infection that can get into your lungs.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  It's very rare. It used to be rare.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  But is all of a sudden, you're seeing all these kids that have this viral lung infection that you never used to see before.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  And it's completely because of the masks.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  100% because of the masks. Yeah, there it is right there.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  Hey, guys, give me a date on that headline.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  Okay, yeah, that, oh, this is from today. COVID-19 and RSV form wicked one-two punch, bringing children's hospitals to the brink.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  Yeah, the one-two punch of the fake pandemic of COVID, making your kids wear a mask and causing them to get RSV.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  RSV infections on the rise and children across Baton Rouge area.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  And the reason it's in the South is because it's more humid.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  So breathing in the humidity in the mask is even worse down there than it is in, you know, drier areas like Colorado or something.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  They're murdering kids, man. These people are sick and they say they love the kids.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  You say you want to fight tyranny. You say you want to fund the Second American Revolution.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  I know you do. That's why you're here.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  So I'm encouraging all of you watching and listening right now to understand that there are really two places in the media that don't back down and that tell the truth that have great products that are self-funded.
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  And that's infowarstore.com with the supplements, the books, the films, the water filters, the air filters, all of it, and Mike Lindell and mypillow.com.

[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  Because we're sponsored by patriots like you and we're thankful and we will never back down to the globalist.
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  So thank you so much for your support.
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  I just can't even believe this satanic dystopian reality I'm in right now.
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  I mean, these people are such demonic liars.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  It's just how does it get worse?
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  So again, Biden's out saying this is about children.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  The Democrats saying this is about children.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  The teachers that want to indoctrinate your kids.
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  This is about children.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  They all love baby murder.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  They all love baby sacrifice.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  And they love getting your kids sick.
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  Again, there have been five studies minimum done on the effects of children wearing masks.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:45.000]  And all of the studies show how bad it is for kids to be wearing masks.
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  Which of course is bad for anybody to wear masks.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  It's bondage.
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  You're breathing in your own bacteria, carbon dioxide.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  I mean, it's a joke.
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  It's a ritual torture sacrament.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  It's ritualistic bondage and torture to make you wear a face mask.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  Hey, you want to wear a mask? Go ahead.
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  You want to walk around all day with a, you know, a butt plug in your butt?
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  Go ahead. Fine.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:15.000]  That's you, bud. Not me.
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  And that's what they're doing.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  Giving you bondage and human torture to kids in the form of a face mask.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  And saying, oh, it's because we love the kids.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  You really want to take advice from someone that says they love the kids as they murder millions of babies.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  Again, I covered it last segment.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  You have a breakout of RSV in the south where it's humid and it's even worse to be wearing the mask all day.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  Because it's humid and you're getting more sweaty and there's more bacteria build up.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  And you have a mass breakout of RSV in kids, unprecedented, never before seen.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  And it's all because they're making them wear masks and they're torturing them.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  It's like, oh, why is there a uptick in suicide?
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  Why is there a uptick in suicide? Because people are being tortured.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  Oh, why is the, why is there outbreak of RSV, RSV in the south?
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  Because kids are being forced to wear masks.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  That's what's so frustrating about this, man.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  To just, to just sit here and do 10 hours of research every day and then just see the media lie.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  Just, just see politicians lie and just know it's a huge lie.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  And that these people are out to get you and it's just like, it should be so obvious.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  I shouldn't have to convince anybody.
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  Like this absolute nonsense.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Our mayor in Austin, Steve Adler, one of the biggest dirt bags you'll ever hear of,
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  one of the smallest, weakest men you're ever going to hear of,
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  is still driving up the fear mongering here in Austin, telling everyone to wear a mask and get vaccinated.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Nobody's listening, thank God.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  Says the hospitals are overwhelmed. I played videos yesterday on the war room.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  People at hospitals, literally a ghost town. Empty, ladies and gentlemen, empty.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  And it's hospital workers and they film and they're like, hey, I keep seeing in the news that the hospitals are overwhelmed.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  Here it is. There's nobody here. It hasn't been all day. It's all a lie.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  But, oh, he wants to fear monger us to go into bondage and take an experimental vaccine.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  And wear masks everywhere. But, oh, what does he have to say about this?
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  Three buses of migrants never tested for COVID dropped off in Austin.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  And 40% of migrants released in Texas, border city of Laredo, test positive for COVID.
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  So, I mean, Adler, where's your fear over that? Adler, where's your fear over the migrants bringing in COVID?
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  Adler, where's your fear of the migrants coming in here with COVID and spreading it?
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  Oh, no, that's okay. It's only for the American citizens. I got it.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  Because it's all a political agenda.
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  It's all a political agenda. And, you know, I hope if we, oh boy, I mean, I pray to God
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  that all of you, fake news, globalist, mafia, henchmen, end up in the cage that you're building for us.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  And you will. And it's called hell.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  But hey, they just deny all of it.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  Democrat Cindy Axney says illegals are not spreading COVID. No, of course not.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  COVID is smart. And it knows if an illegal immigrant crosses the U.S. border with COVID, not to spread.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  This is a political virus. It's very well-trained, very smart. It's a smart virus.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  So it knows, oh, I'm inside an illegal immigrant that just crossed the southern border.
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  So I'm not going to spread to anybody else.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  That's the logic. That's what they're telling you.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  Why anybody takes these people seriously is beyond me.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  Dems try to require a vaccine to fly inside of the United States.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  Oh, yeah. Oh, no, look, if they get this, man, if they get this across and they get this forced vaccines,
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  it's going to be microchips next and it's game over, man.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  It's game over.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  Look at how far we've fallen in a year, a year and a half from this fake pandemic,
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  and now seven months of this Biden administration, this criminal administration.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  Look at how far we've fallen, folks.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  In case you haven't noticed, this ship is going down fast.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  And you know why that is? Because it's by design.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  It's like you watch a controlled demolition. Okay, they hit the button and the building completely down in seconds.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  Took months, maybe years to build one button.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  Seconds completely destroyed.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  That's what we're witnessing right now.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  The freedom, the prosperity, the infrastructure, the innovation all in America took years to build,
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  centuries to build, and the Democrats are pulling the lever,
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  the politicians and the media are pulling the lever and bringing it all to the ground,
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  and you stupid suckers falling for all of it ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  And then they get caught lying about everything.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  Texas Tribune issues huge correction after mistakenly reporting 5,800 children hospitalized with COVID in one week.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  This is all in operation, folks, and here's how I know that, because there's trends, there's patterns.
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  When the Texas Tribune put out that story, it got picked up by every major media outlet and retweeted and rewritten by every major liberal commentator.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  Like Jennifer Rubin, and by the way, most of them have actually deleted their tweets now.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  Like Jennifer Rubin, she deleted her tweet sharing that fake news story.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  But they got caught doing the same thing in Florida, they had to change the numbers.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  They got caught doing the whole thing in the United States, they had to change their numbers.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  That never makes big news.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  It's the fake numbers for the fear mongering that becomes the big story,
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  and then when they have to correct the numbers, and it's like 10% of what they said, they'd never report on it then.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  The numbers are only important to report on when it fits their narrative.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  When it destroys their narrative, then they don't want to report on the numbers.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  But here's that Jennifer Rubin that put out that fake news and deleted her tweet.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  Here's her today.
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  Washington Post Jennifer Rubin celebrates demographic decline of white Americans as fabulous news.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  I mean, I guess she's white. I don't even know what it means to be white anymore.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  Is it really about skin color? Is it hair color? Is it eye color? Is it politics?
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  I guess really it's politics more than anything. You're black, you're white now if you're a conservative transporter, so that's a thing.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  But is Jennifer Rubin white or not? I mean, I don't know.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  If she's white, maybe she should just kill herself.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  Seriously, like, I don't want anybody to die. I'm a lover of life. I'm a lover of all things.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  But hey, I mean, if you think that white people are bad and you think humans are bad, I'll fire up a wood chipper for you.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  Fire it up right now. Hop on in. You never would.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  Or maybe you would. Maybe if you killed all of us first, maybe then you actually would.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  I don't know. Maybe you would. You're taking the vaccine, so I guess it's the same difference.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  Oh, and then what do you know? Head of World Health Organization,
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  Origin Investigation Team admits Communist China told them what to write in the report.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  China creates the virus with their military. China releases the virus with their military.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  China does the investigation and then tells you there's nothing to see here.
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  And now the World Health Organization admits all of it. What a shocker.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity,
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  this will be the most important message you'll hear this year. Here's why.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes,
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid,
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  That's MySolarBackup.com. Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling,

[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  Hey, everybody. If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food,
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  I've got great news. In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  Here's the thing. We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  Survival soup beans. These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious,
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  The best part? We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  It gets even better. With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being,
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  Period. Go to soupbeansurvival.com. That's soupbeansurvival.com
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away.
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  At soupbeansurvival.com. That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  So when I first started taking survival soup, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival soup, the X1.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew.
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  You know, I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  It literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  That's a break free of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  Thank you so much for your support.
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  So thank you all for your support. Check them out today at infowarstore.com.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  The sale runs for only one week.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  It is the booster bodies, natural defenses, super sale.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  And again, another part of the sale ending is the privacy pouches for your cell phone.
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  We're back here live. It's the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  And I'm going to get back into this news here.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  But I want to tell you something because it actually ties into the news with all the COVID.
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  Flu Wuhan flu, Chinese flu, Fauci flu going around. Part of the reason why what, whether it's the flu or anything else is such a problem is because Americans are deficient, extremely deficient in vitamin D.
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  Now, vitamin D is essential already. You need vitamin D big for your immune system.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  And so I'm seeing these graphs of vitamin D deficiency in mostly the elderly and in the youth.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  And you have to understand when you're vitamin D deficient, you're way more susceptible to pick up a flu or COVID or whatever you want to call it and get sick.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  So think about how corrupt the system is that doesn't tell you about vitamin D.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  I've never heard Fauci mention vitamin D, except I think he said, don't take vitamin D.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  I think Fauci wanted to ban vitamin D. I'm not even kidding.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  And they tried to do it in the past and Mel Gibson is famous.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  He didn't add because the government tried to ban vitamins and minerals decades ago, vitamin D and other things.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  So yeah, when you're deficient in vitamin D, you're way more susceptible to get sick.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  And so all of this COVID breakout and the numbers that they inflate are mostly obese people and people who are already sick and people who are deficient in vitamins and minerals because they're not getting them in their daily diets.
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  So I could sit here and show you all the graphs, but we found a good resource here from Merkola, the vitamin D research page, the role of vitamin D in disease prevention.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  There are about 30,000 genes in your body and vitamin D affects nearly 3,000 of them as well as vitamin D receptors located throughout your body.
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  Optimal vitamin D levels can slash your risk of cancer by as much as 60%.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  Imagine what it would do to the flu or anything like that too.
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  Today, many Americans are found to be in a serious deficiency state when it comes to vitamin D.
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  Over 95% of senior citizens in the U.S. may be possibly deficient, along with 85% of Americans in general.
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  The late winter average vitamin D level was found to be about 15 to 18 NGML, which is far below optimal levels.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  Now, I could continue to go through this document from Merkola talking about how important vitamin D is and how America is severely deficient in it and how it's causing the disease outbreaks and all of this stuff.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  But there it is. You know it's there.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  So this is why we sell vitamin D at infowarstore.com.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  And you see it, adults, kids, vitamin D deficient, you're more prone to get disease or even cancer.

[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  In fact, we even came out with the vitamin D3 gummies with calcium.

[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  And we didn't even come out with this thing as like, hey, it's for kids or do a marketing campaign for kids.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  But, I mean, this is perfect for your kids.
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  Again, I showed you the numbers. You can go look it up yourself.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  American youth, very deficient in vitamin D. Don't let that be your child.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  Boost your child's immune system, vitamin D3 gummies from infowarstore.com.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  They're going to love the taste. Just say, hey, every morning, hey, I got a new, you don't even have to tell them it's vitamins.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  Just say, hey, I got a new gummy. You can have it every morning.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  You can have two of these gummies every morning. They're going to eat it. They're going to love it.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  And your child's not going to be deficient in vitamin D.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  Now, if you're an adult and you don't want to take the gummies or you don't like gummies or you don't like, you know, the flavor or whatever,
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  which the flavor is fine. The kids will like it. But maybe you're not into that.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  So we have winter sun plus ultra vitamin D3. Same deal.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  Liquid tincture under the tongue. And you're good.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  Don't be a victim of the corrupt medical establishment.

[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  And the fall and autumn coming up in colder weather.
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  This is when the flu usually starts to get out because you don't have the sun as much getting that natural vitamin D3.

[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  All right.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Got about 90 seconds left here.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  Let me just go through some of these headlines.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  I was going to get into this with Robert Barnes, but it was just so great what he was talking about.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  But Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett turns down requests from Indiana University students to block its vaccine mandate.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  Oh, she stabbed you in the back.
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  And Bob Barnes predicted all this too, by the way.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  Amy Coney Barrett, just another swamp hack that doesn't believe in freedom.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  I was never really a fan of her.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  I had hope, but all hope is lost.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  Law professor who survived COVID-19 sues George Mason University over vaccine mandate.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  Yeah, see, this is how sick it is.
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  This is how you know this is an authoritarian, totalitarian takeover because there's no fairness here.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  There's no science.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  There's just follow the orders.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  There's just totalitarianism where it's well known.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  Even in all the studies that they, the minimal studies that they've have done about these vaccines and other vaccines where if you have the antibodies or you've already recovered from COVID, this vaccine is actually bad for you.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  And they know that.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  But that doesn't matter.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  You don't get an exemption.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  Oh, you've already had COVID.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  You have the antibodies.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  Well, you're going to have to take this lethal injection anyway, because we own you.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  And this is a big pharmaceutical experiment that you have to be in.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  So we'll see what this law professor who sues over the vaccine mandate.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  I just hope he doesn't end up with Amy Coney.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  There is a power grid and want to generate your own supply of off grid electricity.
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  This will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid,
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off the grid bonuses too.

[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  Here's why we now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  This will be the most important message you'll hear this week.
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:55.000]  This will be the most important message you'll hear this week.
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe, an entire system.
[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:27.000]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see the beauty of the sunset,
[2:31:27.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  or the beauty of the waves in the ocean, or the beauty of your wife or your husband,
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music.
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:39.000]  The fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic.
[2:31:39.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  And that itself is what God teaches us is worship.
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:48.000]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in the system,
[2:31:48.000 --> 2:31:51.000]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God.
[2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  And appreciate your consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  The first time I heard the speech, the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade.
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  And we had this history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena.
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  But when it comes to media, Info Wars has been the tip of that spear.
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job as we've done,
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  And that's why if you go to MyPillow.com and use promo code Alex,
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  you get up to 66% off on all the amazing products.
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  He's got so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not just sheets.
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:43.000]  And then you fund Info Wars and Mike Lindell in the fight for free speech against the globalist.
[2:32:43.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  There's not a better place to spend your money than MyPillow.com with promo code Alex.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  And if you do it, it funds the Info War, it funds the election investigation,
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  and it stands up against the globalist bullies.
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:33:01.000]  MyPillow.com, promo code Alex, take action now.
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  Richard Grinnell made this statement this morning.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  Biden and Harris have made total disasters of the U.S. border, Afghanistan, gas prices,
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  and inflation in just seven months.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  And I'm about to cover some of that here coming up in this segment and the next.
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  And that's all completely true.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  And you know, I wasn't planning on doing a plug here this segment, but let me just say this.
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:34:02.000]  If you aren't, if you don't have a plan, a contingency plan for the temporary collapse of America or worse,
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  just a total collapse state in the West, you're nuts.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  Look at how short of a time span you have seen so much of our society and our country destroyed.
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  You can even go back last year, Trump, when he fell for the fake pandemic and went along with all of it to the Biden administration.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  You're seeing the inflation is here, consumer price index going up, production price index going up,
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  things getting more expensive, your value, the value of your dollar going down, your freedom is going away.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  So I mean, seriously, like if you don't have some contingency plan for a temporary or permanent collapse of America, you are insane.
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  So again, I'm not going to do a deep plug here, but I'm telling you, man, you need to get some storeable foods.
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  Get them from infowarstore.com.
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  Don't be caught with your pants down.
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  You are this country is at war right now.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  Not with not not a war that we're used to a physical kinetic war with China or Russia or something with that.
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  No, it's a global criminal cabal mafia going for world domination in a corporate government, world government.
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  And it's all happening right now and they're in the process of destroying America right now.
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  And Biden is the guy with the gun and the knife coming to kill us, coming to kill Lady Liberty.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  So I mean, seriously, if you don't have a contingency plan, you don't have emergency food.
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  We got it at infowarstore.com. We have a whole section of our website for emergency and preparedness gear.
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  So I'm not going to do a deep plug here, but seriously, man, like if you can't see what's coming, if you don't see what's going on,
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  I mean, can you imagine you're watching the Super Bowl and I guess last year's Super Bowl was the Buccaneers and the Chiefs.
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  And imagine you turn you turn the Super Bowl on or you're sitting in the front row at the Super Bowl and the Kansas City Chiefs are on defense.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:13.000]  And they're standing around on the field and they're like talking to one another and like just laughing and having a good time.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  And then the Buccaneers snap the ball and Tom Brady drops back and throws a pass for a touchdown and the Chiefs are just standing around.
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  And the coach is like, hey, there's a game going on. And the fans are like, hey, there's a game going on.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  What are you doing? They're like, there's no game going on here.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  That's what this is. We're at war. America's at war. War for our freedoms, war for our sovereignty, war for truth, war for reality,
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  war for our children, all of it. And a global criminal cabal is at our necks with a knife and a gun to our head.
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  And average Americans have no idea what's going on or imagine even worse.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  Instead of the defense not even realizing that there's a game going on, they start playing for the offense.
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  Imagine that. That's where it's at, too, with all these people promoting the deadly vaccine, promoting the medical tyranny,
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  promoting the destruction of America. They're defensive players helping the offense in a football game.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  So it's one thing to not even realize that the game is going on or that the war is going on.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  It's a whole nother thing to actually play for the opposition. Stockholm syndrome.
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:28.000]  Let me get to the rest of this news.
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  Data shows massive spike in COVID deaths in highly vaccinated Israel.
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  Opposite happening in sparsely-vaxxed Palestine. Oh, isn't that something?
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  I'm funny. Do you guys think as the Taliban is just taking over Afghanistan, I'm wondering, does the Taliban have vaccine mandates for their troops?
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  Do you think the Taliban is mandating a vaccine for their troops?
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  Do you think the Taliban makes their troops run around in red high heels?
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:56.000]  Do you think the Taliban promotes sex changes in their troops?
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  Think the Taliban is all about woke in their troops and skin color and everything?
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  No, I don't think so. I don't think they care about that. No.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  No, and they just are taking over Afghanistan right now.
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  Thanks, Biden. And you know what? I'll get into that later, actually. Let me just move on here.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  Israel sees concerning surge in cardiac arrest and heart attack emergency calls among young people.
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  Yeah, it's called the vaccine side effect. It's called the vaccine side effect.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  Israel made all their people get vaccinated and now they're having heart attacks and blood clots and dying and still getting COVID.
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  Folks, I cannot stress this enough.
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  And you know, here's the thing. People are starting to realize it.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  And I was going to talk about this more in the war room.
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  As I'm seeing other radio hosts and talk show hosts go to their city councils now, go to their school boards now and have these viral videos.
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  Something Info Wars has been doing for decades, something I've been doing for years.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  So Info Wars truly is the cutting edge and the people will follow whether they like Info Wars or even know about Info Wars or whatever.
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  It's almost irrelevant because they're finally getting it.
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  So like I'm sitting up here telling you today, there's a massive eugenics program going on.
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  I'm sitting up here and telling you today, just like you, let's say you have a house and you find a bunch of cockroaches in your house and you don't want them there.
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  So you call an exterminator and they come exterminate the cockroaches.
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  That's how Bill Gates looks at Planet Earth and you.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  That's how Klaus Schwab looks at Planet Earth and you.
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  That's how Anthony Fauci looks at Planet Earth and you.
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  You're a cockroach in their house and they're going to exterminate you.
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  And you can try to hide, but they're going to come for you.
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  And that's what it is. That's the analogy.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  That's what you need to understand.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  The globalists look at you like a cockroach and they want you dead.
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  They want you off the planet that they believe they own.
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  So hey, eventually everybody's going to catch up and everybody's going to get it.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  So I'm glad that I see Matt Walsh and Clay Travis and all these other people finally taking leadership roles in their local community, going to city council meetings, understanding the tyranny that's coming, going and doing activism.
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  That's what we need.
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  And you know what it is.
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  Again, it's not about it's not about info wars.
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  It's just about the truth.
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  It's just about the proper response.
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  Like, you know, Thomas Jefferson and the founding fathers said, hey, look, we have to write these documents.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:46.000]  We have to put out these new slips because we have to explain to people.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  Why we need freedom.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  We have to we have to convince these people that, hey, look, you're not going to have anything under this, the tyranny of the king.
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  They're going to take everything from you.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  So they had the Continental Congress and they had the Declaration of Independence and everything.
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  Because it was like, no, look, you need to know this is why we're going to fight this war, whether you like it or not.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  And so now it's the same thing.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  It's like, hey, look, you need to know they're coming to destroy freedom.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  They're coming to put you in a medical tyranny.
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  They're coming to tax you to death.
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  You got to fight these people.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  Seriously, like this, let me tell you something.
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  The capital gains tax, I think is, I think is the most egregious thing in the perfect example of why taxes, we shouldn't even pay them.
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  You don't have to pay rent anymore.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  So why should we pay taxes?
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  They print trillions of dollars.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  So why should we pay taxes?
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  In fact, the ink isn't even dry on the $1.2 fake infrastructure bill that they just signed.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  And the Democrats have already proposed a $3.5 trillion bill.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  Ink's not even dry on $1.2 trillion, not even a pothole filled.
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  And they're already pushing for $3.5 trillion now.
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  And all that money is going to get stolen, just like all the other money.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  And you're not going to see better infrastructure.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  You're not going to see better schools.
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  You're not going to see better roads and bridges and airports.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  No, no, you're going to see more rich politicians is what you're going to see.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  You're going to see the establishment get more power and influence.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  It's really just incredible, isn't it?
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  Oh, and it's like a story just came out where they say health experts say that Lollipalooza in Chicago was not a super spreader event.
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  Yeah, because there are no super spreader events.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  It's all political.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  Oh, you're at a Trump rally.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  That's a super spreader event.
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  Oh, you're at a Democrat, whatever.
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  That's not a super spreader event.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  No lockdowns in Belarus reports COVID mortality rates similar to neighboring countries that impose lockdowns.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:10.000]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye, also described as the seat of the soul.
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:37.000]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality.
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the pro pure shower head will seal the deal.
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding onto a jaw and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1.
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  So I took it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  You know, I could think again. I could connect with people again.
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  The one I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated.

[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:21.000]  Imagine how corrupt the health care industry is in America run by big pharma.
[2:47:21.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  It says, oh, we need you to take this experimental vaccine emergency use.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:29.000]  But oh, no emergency use for hydroxychloroquine proven to work.
[2:47:29.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  No emergency use for ivermectin proven to work.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  And now they're using ivermectin in India.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  They've been using ivermectin in Mexico.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  Guess what?
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  It cures COVID.
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  Oh, I can't say that.
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  I'm sorry.
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  I'll get sued.
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  Oh, no, no, the vaccine works even though it doesn't work.
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  Think about how corrupt our media and our politicians are where they have a massive event in Chicago,
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  Lollapalooza, and they say, no, that's not a super spreader event.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  But a bunch of conservatives go to a biker festival in Sturgis.
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  Oh, that's a super spreader event.
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  It's all political.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  No lockdowns in Belarus reports COVID mortality rates similar to neighboring countries that
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  impose draconian lockdowns because it's all a lie.
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  It's all a lie.
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  But that's not stopping Philadelphia announces double mask mandate for government workers.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  Double mask.
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  Hey, going to double mask you because one mask doesn't cut off oxygen enough.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  So we got to put you on to two.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:35.000]  By the way, how is the Hunter Biden laptop story taken by the Russians?
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  Not a huge media story broke two days ago.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  Two days ago, three days ago.
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  We headlined it on the war room.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  I think three days ago.
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  No media coverage.
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  Here's the story in the Gateway Pundit.
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  U.S. media goes full prob.
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  Not one single mainstream outlet reports on President's naked son with hooker complaining about Russians stealing his laptop for blackmail.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.000]  And he says he has crazy sex stuff on it.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  So so remember they said that the Russians had the dirt on Trump.
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  Was it always Hunter Biden?
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  Is it Hunter Biden in the PP tape?
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  So so no proof, nothing a made up story about Donald Trump in a PP tape.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:26.000]  Here's the actual Biden family with tons of anecdotal evidence of a PP tape with the Russians and the media doesn't even mention it shows you how corrupt the media is.
[2:49:26.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  Oh, but here's more COVID tyranny for you.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  Man forcibly imprisoned in mental asylum for different opinion in COVID on COVID.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  Paul Joseph Watson's latest that's in Australia.
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:48.000]  I'm getting orders from Alex right now.
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  It's happening.
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  No jab.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  No job program introduced in Sydney forces workers to vaccinate if they want to make a living.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  There's no medical tyranny coming.
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  Just lockdown for a couple weeks.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  We'll fix it.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  Shippers frantic after China's busiest port shuts container terminal due to single COVID case.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  Ah, and you see now COVID is the lever of control.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  COVID is the lever of control.
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  Some people are above COVID.
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  Others aren't.
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  Now they get to pick and choose.
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  Oh, we want to shut these things down.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  Oh, COVID.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  Oh, we want to keep these things running.
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  Don't talk about COVID.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  Pretty nice, isn't it?
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  Pretty, pretty nice.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  And so Australia has it the worst, the worst right now.
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  And they're now bragging about how they're going to go door to door.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  You guys, I'm sorry.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  I just got you said there's a video on this.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  All right, let's go ahead and play the support Alex Jones here with an emergency news bulletin.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  This is a red alert.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  The globalists have moved to their next phase of martial law.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:58.000]  Australia is the main testing zone where all of this is beta tested.
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:03.000]  It is then moved to Europe, then to the UK, then to Canada, then to the United States.
[2:51:03.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  Prepare yourself for this.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  We have an actual video clip on infowords.com where they say it.
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  You got to see this for yourself.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  Authorities won't hesitate to go door to door to perform COVID tests on Australians.
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  infowords.com article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  The Premier of Victoria has asserted that authorities won't hesitate to go door to door
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  to carry out mandatory COVID tests on Australians.
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  Remember, whatever's happening there is coming here in one year.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  We're not at a point where we need to be going door to door.
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  We're not at a point where we need entire suburbs to come out and get tested.
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  If we get to that stage, then we won't hesitate.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  I think we've shown, in fact, I know we've shown that we're prepared to do what has to be done, popular or otherwise.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  In some cases from Australia, it would improve, but pas immediately depending on which section
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  you go, we want students to go to Oulu bites going to Oulu beats.
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  What we want MasterStreet can do.
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  I also want to try out six of them.
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  Awesome.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:17.560]  hesitate, I think we've shown. In fact, I know we've shown we're prepared to do what has to be done,
[2:52:17.560 --> 2:52:22.680]  popular otherwise. They're all following global seeding. It's based on PCR tests.
[2:52:22.680 --> 2:52:28.200]  They've had 10 deaths in Australia this year, probably not even from COVID, but the vaccine now
[2:52:28.200 --> 2:52:34.200]  is causing deaths. But only 23% of Australia has been stupid enough to take the shot. I'm so proud
[2:52:34.200 --> 2:52:39.560]  of the Aussies. That's why they're under martial law. In fact, their leaders have said the lockdowns
[2:52:39.560 --> 2:52:44.440]  will continue until you all take their shot. We'll burn in hell, globalist. We stand with the Aussies.
[2:52:44.440 --> 2:52:50.360]  Half of Americans have taken the shot, at least Saudi Arabia 20%. I'm going to be looking where
[2:52:50.360 --> 2:52:57.800]  they've taken 99% in places like Gibraltar. They have massive illness from so-called COVID and death.
[2:52:57.800 --> 2:53:03.960]  Same thing in the other areas that are above 90% like Israel, Singapore, the list goes on and on.
[2:53:03.960 --> 2:53:11.080]  This is the most criminal coax in history. And then again, as soon as they give the injections,
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:15.880]  they say, oh, now these people have COVID and then expand more lockdowns. It is so obvious.
[2:53:16.600 --> 2:53:24.760]  It is so ridiculous. It's not open. And it's up to us to reject it. Paul Watson's article continues,
[2:53:24.760 --> 2:53:29.160]  given that members of the military are enforcing lockdown and quarantines in some areas of the
[2:53:29.160 --> 2:53:35.640]  country, one wonders how those who don't want to get tested will be treated. Well, we know again
[2:53:35.640 --> 2:53:40.840]  with Dr. Ryan at the United Nations City, that is the end goal is to go into the homes and then
[2:53:40.840 --> 2:53:47.640]  take people to shield areas who, quote, do not have COVID and hold the completely healthy
[2:53:48.360 --> 2:53:55.400]  to protect them from those that might have COVID. And at the moment, in most parts of the world,
[2:53:55.400 --> 2:54:00.440]  due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now
[2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:06.120]  is happening in the household at family level. In some senses, transmission has been taken off
[2:54:06.120 --> 2:54:14.120]  the streets and pushed back into family units. Now we need to go and look in families to find
[2:54:14.120 --> 2:54:20.440]  those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[2:54:20.440 --> 2:54:26.920]  This is simply a way to eradicate and remove in the West all due process
[2:54:26.920 --> 2:54:31.880]  and put us in a permanent form of permanent emergency like North Korea. That is literal
[2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:37.960]  martial law. See the article for yourself at infowars.com and share it. Remember a year ago,
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:41.480]  they were talking about not only do you go on planes in Australia, we didn't take the injections.
[2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:45.400]  I told you to be coming here next and now Biden is promoting it and pushing it. They've got bills
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:51.960]  that are just to do it. This nightmare doesn't end until we wake up until we say no. But again,
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:56.360]  here they are saying they won't hesitate to go door to door to find this phantom menace,
[2:54:56.360 --> 2:55:02.120]  to find this thing that they're witch hunting that came out of the Wuhan lab with Fauci and
[2:55:02.120 --> 2:55:06.120]  Bill Gates and others, which they said would be used for total world government, which they've
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:11.800]  now done. It's time again to expose those who are guilty, to elect leaders that will block
[2:55:11.800 --> 2:55:15.960]  these criminal activities and to bring those who engage in these attacks to justice.
[2:55:16.840 --> 2:55:21.480]  Australia today, tomorrow, the world. Back to the live transmission with Owen Troyer.
[2:55:23.720 --> 2:55:31.560]  So there you go, folks. You know, I got to be honest too, and this may resonate with people.
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:38.680]  Trust me, I'm not a fighter, man. I'm really not. I don't mind like the sport of combat or boxing,
[2:55:38.680 --> 2:55:44.680]  but I'm a lover, man. I love life. I like kicking back and chilling and talking and laughing and,
[2:55:45.480 --> 2:55:53.480]  you know. But I mean, this globalist criminal cabal mafia really wants to fight.
[2:55:54.840 --> 2:55:58.680]  You know, I mean, you can tell the guy at the bar coming up who wants to start a fight. You can
[2:55:58.680 --> 2:56:04.360]  tell the bully at the school jungle gym who wants to fight. I mean, that's what this is.
[2:56:04.360 --> 2:56:11.480]  It's typical criminal psychology. You reach a certain point where you want to get caught.
[2:56:11.480 --> 2:56:14.520]  You reach a certain point where you want to boast of your criminal activity.
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:20.040]  And it's almost getting to that point. And so I guess they just figure that they're either going
[2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:24.920]  to get the fight that they're brewing that they want so bad, or they're going to get
[2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:29.400]  the medical tyranny and total extermination of humanity, which is their agenda.
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:43.880]  So I don't know. I mean, we'll see if this comes to America. We'll see. They'll try.
[2:56:45.080 --> 2:56:48.760]  But, you know, they've reinstituted mask mandates and I talked to people in Dallas and
[2:56:48.760 --> 2:56:53.000]  they're like, nobody cares. There's all these businesses in Austin that have a little mask
[2:56:53.000 --> 2:56:58.680]  mandatory on the front door. Nobody's wearing a mask inside. It's all show. It's all games.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:05.080]  And, you know, America just needs to lead the world right now. And I know we have the most
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:08.120]  corrupt administration, maybe in the world, at least in American history, that the spy
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:14.280]  administration, you know, we still have our muscles to flex of freedom and we can still
[2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:17.880]  flex our muscles and still push back against this and be an example for the world and just
[2:57:17.880 --> 2:57:24.200]  not tolerate any of this tyranny and just say no more and just laugh in their face
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:29.000]  and prank them and joke them and make them feel like the idiots that they are. Hey,
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:34.280]  go ahead and live your life in fear. Woos. Hey, hey, hey, go ahead and believe everything you see
[2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:37.240]  on TV. Go ahead and leave everything the government tells you. Good luck with that.
[2:57:37.800 --> 2:57:38.760]  I'm going to be free.
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:47.080]  Stu Peters coming up, hosting the fourth hour. I'll be hosting the war room coming up in an hour

[2:58:52.040 --> 2:58:57.560]  to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything. Sometimes you know I went a little bit crazy. I
[2:58:57.560 --> 2:59:02.200]  put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping but as far as the
[2:59:02.200 --> 2:59:06.440]  products go turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to taking control
[2:59:06.440 --> 2:59:12.680]  your life take control your health not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in
[2:59:12.680 --> 2:59:17.560]  the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up
[2:59:17.560 --> 2:59:21.800]  today you know what I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier
[2:59:21.800 --> 2:59:25.400]  happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that
[2:59:25.400 --> 2:59:28.760]  happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said
[2:59:28.760 --> 2:59:32.440]  Tate you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one
[2:59:32.440 --> 2:59:36.520]  person who woke up and thought that and that was me. I woke up and thought you know what okay I
[2:59:36.520 --> 2:59:39.320]  want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health and that's why you need to
[2:59:39.320 --> 2:59:43.080]  go to info wars.com take control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy
[2:59:43.080 --> 2:59:47.000]  into the group think don't drink the Kool-Aid drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid is bad and the turbo
[2:59:47.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  force is good. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. There are absolutely things that we can do
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:22.200]  amid all of this pressure this globalist takeover that we talk about at nauseam every single day.
[3:00:23.720 --> 3:00:28.200]  Black pill after black pill after black pill it just seems like it has been hitting us
[3:00:29.080 --> 3:00:35.320]  and some of us have had eyes on this really since you know January when this COVID-19
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:43.400]  rumor mail began we're tracking a virus coming out of China and immediately those of us who are
[3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:51.080]  skeptics or cynics or don the tinfoil hats of the day immediately pointed this out knowing
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:57.080]  that this was at minimum going to be politicized but now coming to the realization that it was
[3:00:57.080 --> 3:01:05.080]  used to completely hijack an entire western civilization and I got to tell you that the
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:11.720]  conversations that I have with experts with scientists with doctors with researchers
[3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:19.960]  with pioneers with developers of protocol with whistleblowers with former employees of places
[3:01:19.960 --> 3:01:26.760]  like Pfizer these people are vindicating every single thing that is being said by people like
[3:01:26.760 --> 3:01:36.600]  me at stoopeders.tv by people like Alex Jones here on info wars I mean this this vindication
[3:01:37.640 --> 3:01:43.080]  feels good but is not the focus and the focus has to be the fight and the fight has to be
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:49.480]  accountability see there are three measures of success to truth telling and that is a the
[3:01:49.480 --> 3:01:55.320]  exposure and the telling of the truth be the mass spreading and sharing of that truth and
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:02:01.480]  then three what to do with it in other words demanding the accountability I have recently
[3:02:01.480 --> 3:02:09.880]  come on very strong against people in this conservative ink media establishment who claim
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:14.200]  to be conservatives but are anything but conservative because the only thing that they
[3:02:14.200 --> 3:02:21.320]  want to conserve is their ability to latch on to the trump fundraising machine and they will
[3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:26.200]  stay as close as they can to president donald trump until it is time to make a move but they
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:33.640]  will never really talk about any of this in a conversation that I just got done having right
[3:02:33.640 --> 3:02:39.640]  before oh and through it to me here for this final hour I just got done talking to dr. zev
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:47.240]  zelenko I'm sure that you've heard him talk and and this it's it's just I mean it's confirmed
[3:02:47.240 --> 3:02:52.360]  every time I talk to somebody with this infinite knowledge this guy's a presidential medal of
[3:02:52.360 --> 3:02:57.880]  freedom nominee a Nobel prize nominee I mean the guy is it was the first person to recommend that
[3:02:57.880 --> 3:03:03.800]  president trump take hydroxychloroquine I mean there's just infinite wisdom there he has treated
[3:03:03.800 --> 3:03:11.560]  what 600,000 some odd patients in upstate new york that could have not died and 99.9
[3:03:11.560 --> 3:03:17.480]  percent treated but for these people all to say that 100 percent unequivocally this is a bio weapon
[3:03:17.480 --> 3:03:27.800]  designed to kill you should absolutely wake you up but all of this goes away in this government
[3:03:27.800 --> 3:03:35.400]  all of this goes away in our country if we bring election integrity back to the country we have to
[3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:42.840]  focus on that as the only thing to worry about and so if you are an elected representative
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:50.840]  and you are not actively fighting actively right now fighting to rid of every electronic voting
[3:03:50.840 --> 3:04:01.080]  machine in your state you are a trader if you are not actively fighting for a forensic audit
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:06.920]  in your state of the 2020 election from the presidential all the way through the down ballot
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:12.280]  you are a trader I don't care what your name is what shows you appear on or where you take
[3:04:12.280 --> 3:04:19.800]  your selfies you are a trader I don't care if you claim to be America first or a trump maga
[3:04:19.800 --> 3:04:30.040]  conservative no you are not you are a trader and every single person in this country who cares
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:36.040]  about the future that we are going to leave for our children needs to stand now and demand
[3:04:36.040 --> 3:04:42.840]  that every single one of these election machines get melted down and turned into bars with which
[3:04:42.840 --> 3:04:46.840]  behind we will place every single tyrant that is trying to take our country they are taking
[3:04:46.840 --> 3:04:52.280]  our military and coming up next I will have internment details as Patrick Holly will join us
[3:04:52.280 --> 3:05:01.480]  in the fourth hour here on the Alex Jones show you say you want to fight tyranny you say you

[3:06:08.680 --> 3:06:14.760]  the military is being targeted by the globalists that want you dead
[3:06:14.760 --> 3:06:23.800]  in turn then the military will be weaponized against itself within its own rank and file
[3:06:25.160 --> 3:06:30.120]  and then weaponized against you and this is not hyperbole there is proof of this Patrick Howley
[3:06:30.120 --> 3:06:36.280]  is senior reporter at national file and he joins us now he's breaking some documents that are
[3:06:36.280 --> 3:06:41.080]  clearly available publicly sourced documents Patrick thank you for being here I mean break this all
[3:06:41.080 --> 3:06:47.640]  down Stu it's great to be here you know the sleepy joe regime is trying to mandate that are
[3:06:47.640 --> 3:06:54.520]  armed men and women in uniform have to get the vaccine the rona jab by september 15th now if
[3:06:54.520 --> 3:07:00.840]  you look at the massive amounts of reports of health complications health problems deaths
[3:07:00.840 --> 3:07:06.760]  immune system problems you know if you are an american patriot you have to stand with our american
[3:07:06.760 --> 3:07:11.960]  soldiers right now and realize that this is perhaps the gravest national security crisis that is
[3:07:11.960 --> 3:07:18.440]  happening in addition to the fact that we have open borders right now so you know the the the
[3:07:18.440 --> 3:07:25.080]  forced vaccine the forced mandate that this sleepy person this abomination this creature
[3:07:25.080 --> 3:07:31.880]  this this child sniffer is trying to inflict upon our heroes must be stopped and I know that you
[3:07:31.880 --> 3:07:37.000]  know we talked prior to the shows too you just got a text about a meeting that is occurring
[3:07:37.000 --> 3:07:42.280]  as we speak where some people in the military are trying to stand up to this at the pentagon
[3:07:42.280 --> 3:07:47.960]  and stop sleepy joe from doing this and I didn't hear back by the way on that and I should interject
[3:07:47.960 --> 3:07:54.440]  here because I did just hear back from that officer in the army who basically told me I asked him
[3:07:54.440 --> 3:07:59.480]  is there any chance of this thing being rolled back and his answer was no I really don't think so
[3:07:59.480 --> 3:08:04.040]  you've seen the packet the packet is pretty airtight there aren't any mistakes in it and
[3:08:04.040 --> 3:08:10.040]  he believes that it's going to be signed by the secretary of the army you know what what this is
[3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:18.280]  about is not only about potentially the physical deterioration of our troops but also the demoralization
[3:08:18.280 --> 3:08:23.400]  of any conservatives any freedom lovers who are in the military and it's still majority freedom
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:29.880]  lovers patriots people who would identify as right wing as conservative and what the military is
[3:08:29.880 --> 3:08:35.960]  trying to do right now under subverted chai com influence leadership is create an ideological
[3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:43.880]  conformity whereby only leftists only globalists only vaccine takers don't shed on me bro are the
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:48.120]  ones who are going to be left in the military why is that so important for them you know I just
[3:08:48.120 --> 3:08:54.120]  broke these documents by the way we reported that every west point cadet who doesn't get the vaccine
[3:08:54.120 --> 3:08:59.240]  gets held in solitary confinement okay that's what some of those young men are going through when
[3:08:59.240 --> 3:09:03.640]  you see them at the army navy football game I have a document here biden's office of the
[3:09:03.640 --> 3:09:09.800]  secretary of defense put out a 13 page document okay I got it it's guidance for their stand downs
[3:09:09.800 --> 3:09:13.960]  every branch of the military had to stand down so this is with the guidance that they were giving
[3:09:13.960 --> 3:09:19.320]  to everybody it stressed that people in the military don't have first amendment guarantees
[3:09:19.320 --> 3:09:26.920]  the way that civilians do speech quote may be restricted some speech quote will have consequences
[3:09:26.920 --> 3:09:31.880]  this is very similar to the un racism inspectors that sleepy joe has invited here they talk about
[3:09:31.880 --> 3:09:36.200]  white supremacists this is the this is the secretary of defense they're talking about
[3:09:36.200 --> 3:09:41.800]  domestic protests referring to january 6 of course and let me just say that when the viking
[3:09:41.800 --> 3:09:46.840]  shaman went in there and tried to shamanically clear the demonic energy from the capital
[3:09:46.840 --> 3:09:51.640]  that was the nicest thing that anyone in government has done for me in months so thank you viking
[3:09:51.640 --> 3:09:58.280]  shaman but of course they are using january 6 as a pretext to try to weaponize the military state
[3:09:58.280 --> 3:10:02.600]  against the civilians who actually love this country and who actually support the military
[3:10:02.600 --> 3:10:09.400]  and and the most amazing thing is they encourage and in fact threaten soldiers to report on other
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:15.640]  soldiers if they have any kind of suspicious behavior okay so what we're seeing down under
[3:10:15.640 --> 3:10:22.440]  right now patrick what we're seeing in australia uh down under we're seeing uh decontamination
[3:10:22.440 --> 3:10:26.760]  tents set up in people's front yards uh their health chief there is saying you're going to be
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:32.760]  arrested if you talk to your neighbor don't don't spark up any unwarranted any unnecessary
[3:10:32.760 --> 3:10:37.400]  conversation at all it is it is not permissible it will not be tolerated you will be jailed
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:44.520]  these things are happening in australia which by every sense of the imaginable word is really
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:50.360]  the prototype for the new world order that seems to be what's happening there what is stopping this
[3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:54.840]  from happening here right now i mean anything it looks like the the military's all set they're
[3:10:54.840 --> 3:11:00.520]  ready to go it's happening here right now i mean just today it was reported that the sleepy joe
[3:11:00.520 --> 3:11:05.720]  regime is considering banning the in vaccinated people like me from moving from one state to another
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:12.600]  going over state lines you know the question is why do they need leftist ideological conformity
[3:11:12.600 --> 3:11:17.080]  in the military why do they only want these communist apparatchiks who are going to take
[3:11:17.080 --> 3:11:22.040]  orders because what kind of abominable orders are they going to start giving against the
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:28.920]  civilians when you start hearing these idiots on msnbc these box wine madow cat ants you know
[3:11:28.920 --> 3:11:34.280]  talking about the um the wonderful grandparents trump supporters maga people who went into the
[3:11:34.280 --> 3:11:39.480]  capital as al-qaeda well if they were al-qaeda we would be giving them weapons and funding their
[3:11:39.480 --> 3:11:44.440]  regime changes all over the world but no they want to treat us like domestic terrorists the army
[3:11:44.440 --> 3:11:49.480]  national guard the national guard here in the united states of america is currently advertising
[3:11:49.480 --> 3:11:56.600]  recruiting for the position of internment resettlement specialist based in washington dc
[3:11:57.240 --> 3:12:03.320]  internment resettlement specialist internment wait a second internment like from history
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:08.120]  oh i have a leak document from u.s headquarters of the army during the obama administration
[3:12:08.120 --> 3:12:14.200]  internment and resettlement operations and there's a whole category for civilian internee
[3:12:14.200 --> 3:12:20.280]  i have a department of defense directive under obama 2014 talking about civilian internees
[3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:25.960]  u.s citizens can be detained as military detainees according to this document quote civilian
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:32.840]  internees may lawfully be detained until the reasons that necessitated the civilians internment
[3:12:32.840 --> 3:12:40.120]  no longer exist quote biometric identification information will be collected from all detainees
[3:12:40.120 --> 3:12:46.920]  bii collected on detainees who are u.s citizens or u.s resident aliens will be conducted in
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:51.640]  accordance with u.s law and of course they're rewriting the law as we speak quote civilian
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:57.640]  internees interned for imperative reasons of security or for their own protection
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:04.840]  oh that's very important or for their own protection maybe they just need to protect
[3:13:04.840 --> 3:13:10.440]  all of their democrats from these unvaccinated people or maybe the unvaccinated people are the
[3:13:10.440 --> 3:13:15.880]  ones who they say need to be protected from the supershedders who got their all their
[3:13:15.880 --> 3:13:22.520]  fizer jabs these walking little uh you know uh petri dishes with their disgusting germ filled
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:30.680]  face masks on okay they can do basically anything when it comes to internment including of u.s
[3:13:30.680 --> 3:13:36.360]  citizens according to their own justifications their own top secret documents and now they're
[3:13:36.360 --> 3:13:41.400]  advertising for people to intern people so you want to ask why are they throwing out why are
[3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:45.960]  they doing all of these new background checks on an in less these to get rid of white wingers
[3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:51.240]  why are they throwing out anybody who posted pepe the frog on social media because when it
[3:13:51.240 --> 3:13:56.600]  comes time to take unlawful orders they don't want any oathkeepers around they don't want any
[3:13:56.600 --> 3:14:01.880]  people saying no i'm about the constitution not about your orders they want people who are going
[3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:09.160]  to take orders directly from chairman chi and the damn chai comps so this has been you said this was
[3:14:09.160 --> 3:14:12.360]  during the obama administration that all this was rolled out we got about a minute and a half left
[3:14:12.360 --> 3:14:16.920]  here but i just want to know so this by all intents and purposes we're looking at obama's third
[3:14:16.920 --> 3:14:21.880]  term i mean he's probably in the white house god knows that sleepy joe has no idea even where he is
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:26.680]  you saw a clip the secret service was actually uh perplexed and concerned that you know uh
[3:14:26.680 --> 3:14:31.240]  biden didn't really know his way around the white house grounds he appeared to be lost the other day
[3:14:31.240 --> 3:14:36.600]  so do you see this i mean this is a 2010 document that we're looking at here here we are 11 years
[3:14:36.600 --> 3:14:42.760]  later almost 12 do you see this thing actually being implemented what has slowed this from happening
[3:14:42.760 --> 3:14:49.160]  and when will it happen the freedom loving patriots in this country like you and me stew and all of the
[3:14:49.160 --> 3:14:54.440]  great viewers of info wars need to stand our ground and make sure that we are monitoring these people
[3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:58.760]  in real time that we are getting this information out to the whole world finally the paradigm has
[3:14:58.760 --> 3:15:03.320]  changed people realize what's happening obama's back in there for third term they got susan rice
[3:15:03.320 --> 3:15:09.640]  they got valerie jaret running this administration in in in alliance with the the chinese communists
[3:15:09.640 --> 3:15:14.440]  in the deep state so i'll tell you right now congresswoman jackie spear who is trying to
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:19.000]  subvert the military uh she's going to be disgraced next week when i report on her links to human

[3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:30.360]  election results the tainted ballots in the arizona are weighed many more times than sleepy joe's

[3:19:35.240 --> 3:19:40.600]  it's great to be on with you it's an honor honor talk to you awesome uh so firstly i wanted to do
[3:19:40.600 --> 3:19:46.920]  was say i love the product alpha power even at 29 if you ask my better half she loves it
[3:19:46.920 --> 3:19:51.560]  all right it helps in the bedroom so just number one for a few i like that only works it's not a
[3:19:51.560 --> 3:20:17.080]  joke absolutely you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:17.080 --> 3:20:21.800]  all of the evidence that we have presented with all of the experts that we have talked to all of
[3:20:21.800 --> 3:20:27.400]  the doctors everybody that i've aforementioned concludes just one thing that this is a bio weapon
[3:20:27.400 --> 3:20:33.400]  we know that when you're talking about covid as in the virus bio weapon intentionally released
[3:20:34.040 --> 3:20:38.680]  intentionally chimerically engineered and released and when you come to the understanding
[3:20:38.680 --> 3:20:43.080]  that the vaccines were not meant to combat the virus but that the virus was rolled out to introduce
[3:20:43.080 --> 3:20:48.360]  the vaccines then you will have a better understanding we're talking about massive die-off and this is
[3:20:48.360 --> 3:20:53.000]  not for hyperbole this is not for shock value i'm telling you that americans and world global
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:58.840]  citizens need to start preparing themselves for the reality of watching their loved ones their
[3:20:58.840 --> 3:21:05.720]  family members their friends stacked up dead in huge mounds of bodies and pushed by heavy equipment
[3:21:05.720 --> 3:21:12.920]  like bulldozers into super deep holes right here on our soil i have just found out that the
[3:21:12.920 --> 3:21:17.640]  thing will not be walked back the mandate is going to apply in the military it's over two
[3:21:17.640 --> 3:21:23.560]  million people because that includes contractors reservists national guard active duty they're
[3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:27.000]  going to be required to take this and so a lot of military personnel are saying well i'm just
[3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:33.240]  going to walk according to patrick howley that basically is exactly what they want to do because
[3:21:33.240 --> 3:21:40.280]  they are going to purge the military get rid of anybody who stands on the constitution the military
[3:21:40.280 --> 3:21:44.680]  is not supposed to be politicized or picked sides and they don't serve a president they serve and
[3:21:44.680 --> 3:21:50.280]  protect the constitution of the united states which is why well did they capture the vote
[3:21:50.920 --> 3:21:55.880]  how can the military let this stand why isn't anybody really focused on these forensic audits
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:21:59.400]  why are all of these elected representatives running around at pool parties taking pictures of
[3:21:59.400 --> 3:22:03.560]  themselves and then grifting for fundraisers on social media rather than doing everything they
[3:22:03.560 --> 3:22:08.440]  can to fight to rid of these electronic voting machines that connect to the internet and demanding
[3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:13.800]  a forensic audit in their state the line is clear in the sand you do those things you are a patriot
[3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:24.120]  you don't do those two things you are a trader the outrageously horrific infrastructure bill
[3:22:26.120 --> 3:22:30.680]  is going to absolutely do everything except infrastructure the only infrastructure it's
[3:22:30.680 --> 3:22:36.120]  going to give is to the government that wants you dead and in order to effectively kill you
[3:22:36.120 --> 3:22:41.240]  they have to be able to track you which is why i think it's 2026 every new vehicle manufactured
[3:22:41.240 --> 3:22:47.960]  according to this bill will have retina scanners in it they will scan your eyes have you been a
[3:22:47.960 --> 3:22:51.560]  good boy have you been a bad boy what was your social credit score did you post something in
[3:22:51.560 --> 3:22:59.160]  opposition to the to the regime on social media have you had your vaccination you may not be
[3:22:59.160 --> 3:23:05.800]  qualified to drive today stew you might not be able to go from point a to point b so
[3:23:05.800 --> 3:23:11.240]  tracking you is very important what are they going to implant inside of you as we talked about i
[3:23:11.240 --> 3:23:15.160]  think it was yesterday i was on the war room with owen what are they going to do are they going to
[3:23:15.160 --> 3:23:18.840]  implant something in you to confirm whether or not you've had this and made all of the hesitancy
[3:23:18.840 --> 3:23:22.840]  and people saying you know i'm not going to get this thing i'll just get my fake papers and and
[3:23:22.840 --> 3:23:26.920]  that'll be my passport but no no no we've anticipated that we've got that covered as well
[3:23:28.120 --> 3:23:34.920]  so they are already collecting a database of people specifically your kids to find out whether
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:40.520]  or not they have been inoculated and we don't have that phone recording here but i have heard
[3:23:40.520 --> 3:23:49.160]  it patrick holly has also heard it he's back with us now patrick the cdc is calling houses homes we've
[3:23:49.160 --> 3:23:53.800]  sourced the phone numbers we've seen the documents that go along with this they're calling you in
[3:23:53.800 --> 3:23:57.800]  your home and asking you if you have kids who have been vaccinated what's this all about i mean is
[3:23:57.800 --> 3:24:05.160]  this is this a tracking registry the sleepy joe regime is absolutely determined to try to vaccinate
[3:24:05.160 --> 3:24:09.560]  your children you're seeing school districts promoting these Pfizer vaccination events giving
[3:24:09.560 --> 3:24:15.800]  away free backpacks and school supplies to kids okay making it very clear that they don't need
[3:24:15.800 --> 3:24:20.360]  parental consent if they're over the age of 12 to get the vaccination they're obsessed with this
[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:25.160]  and you know since the census is in the news you know what the the biden people did with our
[3:24:25.160 --> 3:24:34.200]  census data they created a map county by county color coded a vaccine hesitancy hot spots as part
[3:24:34.200 --> 3:24:41.160]  of their we can do this campaign to vaccinate everybody we can do this guys right so they used
[3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:47.320]  your us census data to identify you as a vaccine hesitant person okay this is what they're doing
[3:24:47.320 --> 3:24:53.480]  with the us census data and kamala harris is encouraging people to go door to door and she
[3:24:53.480 --> 3:24:59.480]  was talking to some of these door to door activists and she even went through every single possible
[3:24:59.480 --> 3:25:04.360]  reason why somebody at a front door would say no i don't want to get a vaccine and she already had
[3:25:04.360 --> 3:25:08.760]  oh here's your talking point that you give it back to them well the thing she was saying was very
[3:25:08.760 --> 3:25:13.720]  similar to this document that just leaked out of the national health service in the uk which we got
[3:25:13.720 --> 3:25:19.080]  where they are trying to figure out how to psychologically manipulate people in different
[3:25:19.080 --> 3:25:25.240]  categories in order to get them to vote for to get the vaccine to boost the rates so for over
[3:25:25.240 --> 3:25:32.600]  65s this is their line the virus isn't getting weaker over 65s are over three times more likely
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:37.720]  to die if you get covid think about how you will feel if you do not get vaccinated and end up with
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:42.440]  covid 19 all right so they're doing the hard sell on the old people then with the young people they
[3:25:42.440 --> 3:25:48.760]  go we understand the restrictions have caused you anxiety depression loneliness and isolation
[3:25:48.760 --> 3:25:53.240]  you are invited later during the the covid rollout because you are unlikely to get it
[3:25:53.240 --> 3:25:58.680]  and have complications they even admit that however your vaccination is vital you are key
[3:25:58.680 --> 3:26:03.560]  to achieving community immunity because we need about 80 percent coverage you have a very important
[3:26:03.560 --> 3:26:08.680]  perk to play in the national effort normality can only return for you and others with your
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:13.880]  vaccination oh hey young people are depressed because they can't go to bars they can't go outside
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:18.520]  they're trapped in their houses you want your normality back this is like the mafia hey
[3:26:18.520 --> 3:26:22.760]  some good normality you got here would be a shame if something happened to it right but
[3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:28.280]  we know that dr. Anthony Fauci funded this whole thing for you know as you know yeah but don't
[3:26:28.280 --> 3:26:33.640]  people see I mean there these people the same people that are coming up with all these counter
[3:26:33.640 --> 3:26:38.200]  talking points are the same people that are on television right out in front of everybody with
[3:26:38.200 --> 3:26:44.280]  a wide open saying no no no now the vaccinated people are spreading this delta variant around
[3:26:44.280 --> 3:26:49.640]  I mean this was on yahoo on the 26th of last month and this is I mean yahoo by no sense of the word
[3:26:49.640 --> 3:26:54.680]  is a conservative or honest reporting entity and they're admitting that uh in other words
[3:26:55.640 --> 3:27:02.120]  why can the government tell you no your your vaccine your your injection is really not going
[3:27:02.120 --> 3:27:05.800]  to restore any rights you're still going to have to mask your kids still going to have to mask you're
[3:27:05.800 --> 3:27:08.680]  still going to have to social distance you may not be able to go out in public you're going to
[3:27:08.680 --> 3:27:12.920]  have to limit your crowd gathering sizes despite the fact that you've been vaccinated because
[3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:18.200]  no it does not guarantee that you will not contract the deadly world ending plague and
[3:27:18.200 --> 3:27:23.560]  it doesn't protect anybody else against transmission from you and even if you're vaccinated and
[3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:28.520]  they're vaccinated you're still at very high risk this thing is not going away so really
[3:27:28.520 --> 3:27:33.160]  doesn't that just completely obliterate all of the countermeasures that camila harris seemingly
[3:27:33.160 --> 3:27:38.600]  has armed her door knockers with well look they just need to keep this thing going and they
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:42.920]  realize they had a problem if they vaccinate too many people and then it's like oh let's go back to
[3:27:42.920 --> 3:27:46.440]  normal it's like oh we can't do that because they obviously they need to keep their mechanism of
[3:27:46.440 --> 3:27:51.640]  control going their mechanism of control is coronavirus lockdown and tyranny but make no
[3:27:51.640 --> 3:27:56.360]  mistake we know where this came from dr anthony fouchy funded the back coronavirus research at
[3:27:56.360 --> 3:28:00.760]  the wuhan institute of virology mike Pompeo president donald trump i'll take their word for
[3:28:00.760 --> 3:28:06.040]  it when they say that's where it leaked out of okay and meanwhile you had people testing positive
[3:28:06.040 --> 3:28:11.720]  for this ridiculous thing with the common cold the cdc is now implicitly admitted that that flew
[3:28:11.720 --> 3:28:16.280]  the people with the flu were getting this how come flu deaths went down astronomically did
[3:28:16.280 --> 3:28:22.920]  we cure the flu give me a break if you don't see what's going on right now uh you know this uh
[3:28:22.920 --> 3:28:27.000]  we're in the middle of a communist takeover we are in the middle of a globalist communist
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:33.240]  authoritarian corporate bankster intel deep state takeover but we're not going to stand for it ladies
[3:28:33.240 --> 3:28:36.840]  and gentlemen go look at the parents who are protesting at school boards around the country
[3:28:36.840 --> 3:28:41.960]  sleepy joe's getting nervous about that go look at all the protest outside hospitals among doctors
[3:28:41.960 --> 3:28:46.840]  and nurses who don't want to take this vaccine we're doing as well as france now and getting out
[3:28:46.840 --> 3:28:52.120]  there into the streets and protesting that's what we got to do i love you all that's right
[3:28:52.120 --> 3:28:57.960]  that's your colleague find them at national file dot com uh dr ruby coming up next the scientific
[3:28:57.960 --> 3:29:03.480]  dictatorship that i've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone for beta testing to
[3:29:03.480 --> 3:29:09.080]  operational the globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover their
[3:29:09.080 --> 3:29:13.480]  robot takeover but the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have
[3:29:13.480 --> 3:29:17.960]  been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to find it off
[3:29:17.960 --> 3:29:22.920]  humanity is strong we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening we have a
[3:29:22.920 --> 3:29:28.120]  real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance we will defeat it so prayer is essential
[3:29:28.120 --> 3:29:33.160]  research is essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential and at
[3:29:33.160 --> 3:29:38.520]  the same time supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential

[3:29:59.080 --> 3:30:04.600]  first started taking survival skills basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog
[3:30:04.600 --> 3:30:09.640]  like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i
[3:30:09.640 --> 3:30:14.280]  listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty
[3:30:14.280 --> 3:30:18.200]  good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that stew you had you know with a deep burdened
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:22.840]  source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and then in two weeks i went from
[3:30:22.840 --> 3:30:28.920]  brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could
[3:30:28.920 --> 3:30:34.120]  connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back
[3:30:34.120 --> 3:30:38.600]  and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all absolutely amazing

[3:30:43.160 --> 3:30:47.880]  it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break
[3:30:47.880 --> 3:30:52.680]  free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own

[3:33:15.480 --> 3:33:21.240]  stew peters dot tv that is where you find me i appreciate you having me here the fourth hour
[3:33:21.240 --> 3:33:25.400]  here of the alex jones show of course oan shroyer coming up next with the war room we have dr
[3:33:25.400 --> 3:33:30.520]  jane ruby standing by to tell us about something you know uh if you're thinking you're going to get
[3:33:30.520 --> 3:33:36.200]  your freedoms back by taking the inoculation uh you just wake up you have to understand that
[3:33:36.200 --> 3:33:40.440]  that is absolutely just not happening and patrick holly hit the nail right on the head because if
[3:33:40.440 --> 3:33:44.600]  we just go ahead and inoculate everybody a couple of things will happen you know holly's
[3:33:45.320 --> 3:33:50.600]  take on that was well we have to maintain our globalist control our takeover so we have to
[3:33:50.600 --> 3:33:54.840]  have something to hold over their heads the other the flip side of that is if we vaccinate too many
[3:33:54.840 --> 3:33:58.600]  people or inject or inoculate too many people with these shots being falsely referred to as
[3:33:58.600 --> 3:34:03.960]  vaccines we know that they're a bio weapon they're poisonous people are dying in mass numbers i talked
[3:34:03.960 --> 3:34:09.400]  as a lanko i've talked to attorney thomas renz you've heard from all these people listen there are
[3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:15.000]  a dozen devices for tracking the adverse events that are being reported and we only have access
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:19.480]  to one and that one happens to be the most unreliable source which is the vaccine event
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:26.200]  adverse reporting system or however it's called the bears system uh why well because if you
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:31.880]  inoculate everybody everybody's going to die all at once and then we've been had but the very person
[3:34:32.440 --> 3:34:39.480]  responsible for devising this whole plan is the one who stood up in front of the world and said
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:46.760]  we need to depopulate the globe by 15 percent now here we are years later and the guy behind
[3:34:46.760 --> 3:34:53.960]  the entire inoculation program is the guy who said that i'm not taking i'm not taking an
[3:34:53.960 --> 3:34:59.800]  injection from him but you are you're taking both of them and now not only that but dr jane ruby is
[3:34:59.800 --> 3:35:06.840]  joining us it's getting even worse it's not just one jab that is authorized for emergency use it's
[3:35:06.840 --> 3:35:13.800]  not two jabs that is authorized for emergency use but dr ruby says now there are more jabs
[3:35:13.800 --> 3:35:18.760]  coming down the pipe dr ruby thank you for being here how many times are they going to try to stick
[3:35:18.760 --> 3:35:26.760]  us just insensibly over and over again this is not just about one vaccine is it no let's do and the
[3:35:26.760 --> 3:35:36.600]  insanity grows uh i want everyone to know that the cdc advisory panel uh advised that uh the shot
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:41.960]  as a third booster should be made readily available immediately to people who they called
[3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:47.720]  immunocompromised now in the medical world immunocompromised can can mean several things
[3:35:47.720 --> 3:35:52.200]  you could be a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy that has your body suppressed you
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:57.720]  could be taking immunosuppressive drugs to protect you from organ rejection if you had a
[3:35:57.720 --> 3:36:03.880]  an organ transplant for example uh you could have certain types of infections that that render you
[3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:08.920]  more vulnerable but but here's the thing it's we predicted this i predicted this on on your show
[3:36:08.920 --> 3:36:15.000]  the stew peters show weeks ago because in the fizer uh protocol that is listed on clinical
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:22.520]  trials dot gov they literally spell out that they have a plan for booster three and booster four
[3:36:22.520 --> 3:36:29.080]  and they even have timing referenced in their stew about every six months now in this cdc advisory
[3:36:29.080 --> 3:36:35.080]  that just came out where the panel recommends immediate availability for the booster or what
[3:36:35.080 --> 3:36:43.160]  we're calling the third shot as well uh is is is recommended as early as 28 days after you completed
[3:36:43.160 --> 3:36:50.360]  your second injection for fizer or moderna this insanity has no end stew no end this week there's
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:56.440]  psychopathic serial killers they are psychopathic serial killers that's what they are the same people
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:37:01.720]  that laugh in the lab about sticking you know primates who haven't been sedated yet making them
[3:37:01.720 --> 3:37:08.840]  scream these people are absolutely psychopathic serial killers that is who we are dealing with
[3:37:09.400 --> 3:37:15.960]  and this has been a concerted global effort and i will tell you that i think the theory behind you
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:22.840]  know this far-reaching effect this this stranglehold that these psychopaths have been able to implement
[3:37:22.840 --> 3:37:31.400]  on the globe because if you notice lockstep from every single country i mean other than a few who
[3:37:31.400 --> 3:37:37.320]  have since been assassinated nobody has really stepped up against this and that is why because
[3:37:37.320 --> 3:37:42.440]  the people who are are ending up dead so here's a swiss bank account with 500 million dollars in it
[3:37:42.440 --> 3:37:48.600]  with more to come or i got a bullet for every one of your kids i mean that's the only theory that i
[3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:53.080]  can come up with and i just had a conversation with dr zev zelenko who tends to agree that that's
[3:37:53.080 --> 3:37:59.000]  exactly what's going on here he yes i've spoken with dr zelenko recently a couple of times and he
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:05.080]  makes no bones about it this highly esteemed physician is saying that this is a death shot this
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:10.600]  is mass murder this is genocide and stew the side effect profile you know i've said all along
[3:38:10.600 --> 3:38:15.800]  where's the threshold where's the cutoff point before this will be shut down and we are now
[3:38:15.800 --> 3:38:22.360]  looking at uh the the cdc's morbidity immortality weekly report that just came out a week ago
[3:38:22.360 --> 3:38:31.000]  with exploding numbers of myocarditis heart attacks strokes in 12 to 17 year olds this is
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:36.840]  this is it's unfathomable it's nothing i've ever seen or any of us has ever seen in our lifetimes
[3:38:36.840 --> 3:38:43.800]  or careers there is no one of you know at the wheel at the fda or or if or if they are they're
[3:38:43.800 --> 3:38:49.000]  in on this mass genocide there's no other explanation for this and so and we're seeing an
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:54.600]  explosion of other other side effects i get hundreds of emails a day in my proton mail
[3:38:54.600 --> 3:39:01.320]  with people watching their mothers their their 60 70 80 year old mothers and fathers aunts and
[3:39:01.320 --> 3:39:09.160]  uncles grandparents dying a slow painful death stew pain dr charles hoff has been talking about
[3:39:10.120 --> 3:39:15.960]  with an explanation of why we're seeing variation in symptoms i'm not sure if the audience has seen
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:23.320]  this yet but i wanted to share some of that with you because he talks about the the injected as
[3:39:23.320 --> 3:39:30.680]  basically three groups and and so he says only a small amount of people produce the the spike
[3:39:30.680 --> 3:39:35.720]  protein you know there's variability in how each human body is going to react we've said this
[3:39:35.720 --> 3:39:41.240]  as well and and how they're going to respond to the mrna direction to make the spike proteins and
[3:39:41.240 --> 3:39:47.480]  so he says some people will make only a small amount of the spike protein and in places in
[3:39:47.480 --> 3:39:53.320]  their body that won't be able to injure them that much i don't know if that's a static thing or if
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:39:58.520]  he expects that to change and those people will have no side effects then you have the second
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:04.600]  group where other people who make more of the spike protein and in places which your body
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:09.880]  cannot easily cope with and this is where the mini clots come in lots of doctors are saying
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:16.680]  along with dr charl uh dr philip van welbergen in the uk remember who had the blood smears of
[3:40:17.320 --> 3:40:22.360]  injected patients with those really horrific blood cells compared to normal red blood cells
[3:40:23.080 --> 3:40:28.840]  and he's he said all the blood tests were normal jane so and the imaging was normal and this is
[3:40:28.840 --> 3:40:34.280]  what dr hoff is talking about but when when dr philip put the blood under the microscope
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:39.560]  there's where he saw the pathology and dr hoff is saying people are making these microclots you
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:43.800]  can't see them but they're getting into the lungs and that's why people are having trouble breathing
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:49.560]  they get into the cardiac tissue their their hearts they get chest pain pressure they have
[3:40:49.560 --> 3:40:55.560]  permanent damage and then he says the third group is a very unfortunate but utterly predictable
[3:40:55.560 --> 3:41:01.160]  minority that make up a large amount of spike protein in their bodies and in very dangerous
[3:41:01.160 --> 3:41:07.000]  places like the heart the brain the blood supply to your intestines and they die a hideous death
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:12.680]  from blood clots stroke oxygen starvation and other tissues and organs they know what's happening
[3:41:12.680 --> 3:41:18.680]  and they don't care stew these are the letters i'm getting every day i i am just imploring everyone
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:23.720]  where does this stop we've got it's us it's just the american people we've got to stop it
[3:41:24.440 --> 3:41:29.160]  yeah and it's it's global citizens our brothers and sisters in faith our brothers and sisters in
[3:41:29.160 --> 3:41:34.040]  humanity so it's not exclusive to here and as a matter of fact the only reason why it hasn't taken
[3:41:34.040 --> 3:41:39.960]  over by a hundred percent grip here is because 450 million guns in the hands of 150 some odd
[3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:44.520]  million patriots who are just not going to stand for the decontamination tent in the front yard
[3:41:44.520 --> 3:41:50.200]  or not being permitted to talk to your neighbor but now the military as holly described is being
[3:41:50.200 --> 3:41:56.040]  purged so that it's only filled with woke people who will obey unlawful orders and then turn on
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:42:01.160]  the people of the united states of america so we have seen all of these global leaders true dough
[3:42:01.160 --> 3:42:05.800]  and you know down in australia and uk leaders that have been kind of you know basically their
[3:42:05.800 --> 3:42:10.680]  their lives and their the lives of their families we can assume have been threatened by these psychopaths
[3:42:11.240 --> 3:42:15.400]  and then they've been promised billions of dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars
[3:42:15.400 --> 3:42:21.320]  the media is in lockstep with this as well there's not one brave soul on a mainstream major broadcast
[3:42:21.320 --> 3:42:25.880]  network cable news channel that is willing to come forward and not one elected representative
[3:42:25.880 --> 3:42:33.240]  has yet come forward but but a federal agency is now coming forward can you believe it so a federal
[3:42:33.240 --> 3:42:37.960]  agency all of the things that we're talking about here all of the dangers that are associated with
[3:42:37.960 --> 3:42:42.200]  this all of the heart swelling that we're talking about the blood cell damage that you just showed
[3:42:42.200 --> 3:42:47.800]  there the myocarditis the tremors all of these things and guess what the one person who we've
[3:42:47.800 --> 3:42:52.840]  been naming here saying they're never going to help us are now forced to do something to warn
[3:42:52.840 --> 3:42:56.520]  the public and we're gonna be with that we're gonna show it to you coming up right after the break
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:43:02.120]  stick around i'm up here working on a thursday night in mid april 2021 and i just want to say
[3:43:02.120 --> 3:43:06.920]  something i am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over

[3:43:59.320 --> 3:44:04.040]  the globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has to have its revolution
[3:44:04.840 --> 3:44:12.920]  we have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological
[3:44:12.920 --> 3:44:18.680]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled
[3:44:20.600 --> 3:44:28.200]  slaves worsted slaves just just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down
[3:44:28.200 --> 3:44:33.880]  to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control
[3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:39.880]  we have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and
[3:44:39.880 --> 3:44:45.720]  we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia it's that choice
[3:44:45.720 --> 3:44:50.840]  it's that realization that's going to change the world and it's the only choice we've got
[3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:56.040]  freedom or slavery good or evil it is a spiritual battle an info wars at the tip of the spear fighting
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:45:03.240]  it the scientific dictatorship that i've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[3:45:03.240 --> 3:45:09.320]  from beta testing to operational the globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation
[3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:14.200]  takeover their robot takeover but the good news is we've been working and you've been working
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:18.440]  and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to
[3:45:18.440 --> 3:45:23.720]  find it off humanity is strong we're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[3:45:23.720 --> 3:45:28.600]  we have a real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance we will defeat it so prayer is
[3:45:28.600 --> 3:45:33.480]  essential research is essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:38.520]  essential and at the same time supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us

[3:47:10.440 --> 3:47:15.720]  minus and then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world
[3:47:15.720 --> 3:47:20.920]  government's being established where members of congress and former presidents are censored by big
[3:47:20.920 --> 3:47:27.000]  tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood plots and and prions
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:33.160]  all over your body that you're not allowed to fly on an airplane think about that because that's
[3:47:33.160 --> 3:47:39.720]  where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell just five years ago if somebody told you this would
[3:47:39.720 --> 3:47:45.640]  be happening but it is happening now and then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine is a gene
[3:47:45.640 --> 3:47:50.200]  therapy and it doesn't really work so you got to take it every few months and the people that
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:55.000]  have submitted say great i want to take it all the time so i can go outside and not get sick from
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:59.960]  coven even though it gets you sick from coven and now there's record numbers of really sick people
[3:47:59.960 --> 3:48:05.000]  from the sloughing the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline studies bill gates and
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:16.920]  falci did this need to go to prison for it right now need to go to prison um yeah and and uh a lot
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:22.520]  worse uh i've been i've been quoted in the uh what is this called the usa today and news week
[3:48:23.240 --> 3:48:33.080]  stew peters calls for the execution of tony fauci well crimes against humanity if he's guilty of it
[3:48:33.080 --> 3:48:43.160]  i wouldn't argue i wouldn't argue uh joining us is dr jane ruby so the cdc the nih these two
[3:48:43.160 --> 3:48:53.000]  agencies have written the gospel for every single doctor in the united states who if they act outside
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:49:01.240]  of this authority the one science the fauci science the murderous premeditated death sentence
[3:49:01.880 --> 3:49:06.840]  for every quote unquote covid patient because there is a virus out there and it is killing people
[3:49:06.840 --> 3:49:10.840]  there's no question about that and if you don't treat yourself or use some sort of a prophylactic
[3:49:10.840 --> 3:49:16.680]  you know uh regiment this thing could hit you pretty hard this bio weapon is designed to hurt
[3:49:16.680 --> 3:49:23.880]  maim and capacitate handicap and kill so with that being said we have reported on this morning
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:32.600]  a doctor in florida who was retired after 49 years as a physician in the emergency department
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:39.560]  was next to a fellow covid patient in the covid ward and was this guy's uh what do you call that
[3:49:39.560 --> 3:49:46.120]  his uh advocate his patient advocate and they wouldn't give him the proper things that he needed
[3:49:46.120 --> 3:49:50.520]  they just wanted to throw him on event this guy's advocating for him as a result of that they take
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:56.760]  this doctor and they put him into solitary confinement in a hospital not in a prison
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:50:04.200]  in a hospital they take this 70 year old 49 year emergency room physician in a four point restraints
[3:50:04.200 --> 3:50:11.400]  into solitary confinement and then discharge him against medical advice send him home with this
[3:50:11.400 --> 3:50:17.240]  covid and he's he's dealing with that on his own i interviewed him doctors are being threatened
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:22.520]  by hospital administrators in the hallways with their jobs while they're on their way to administer
[3:50:22.520 --> 3:50:31.480]  a nutrition vitamin c ivermectin that will not be tolerated that will not be allowed to happen
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:38.920]  here in the united states so with that being said down in florida we see all over the news
[3:50:40.120 --> 3:50:45.560]  huge huge influx of covid patients because there's a lot of vaccine hesitancy there
[3:50:46.520 --> 3:50:51.560]  the mask mandates will not be tolerated by governor ronda santis and so we are seeing
[3:50:52.120 --> 3:50:57.320]  huge numbers of hospitalizations happening there you're in florida tell me this isn't true
[3:50:57.320 --> 3:51:04.440]  first of all stew i want to say as a licensed medical professional myself that what you described
[3:51:04.440 --> 3:51:10.440]  and what your uh interviewee talked about in the sarasota hospital is really medical assault and
[3:51:10.440 --> 3:51:17.240]  it's worse than that it's it's premeditated murder when you withhold as a licensed medical person
[3:51:17.240 --> 3:51:23.880]  when you knowingly are you're withholding a knowingly helpful treatment uh or or basic nutrition
[3:51:23.880 --> 3:51:29.960]  without the patients like you know in a proxy a health care proxy without their you know informed
[3:51:29.960 --> 3:51:36.120]  knowledge and and requests for that you you are committing uh medical assault at the very least
[3:51:36.120 --> 3:51:40.760]  if not murder and i wanted to say that that that that that is not only grounds for removal of your
[3:51:40.760 --> 3:51:45.560]  license it should it should be uh it should be criminal there should be a criminal proceeding
[3:51:45.560 --> 3:51:51.160]  but we we we are apparently deviating from the rule of law but to your question on what's going
[3:51:51.160 --> 3:51:56.040]  on down here in florida uh i broke a story last weekend when i saw something come over the national
[3:51:56.040 --> 3:52:01.640]  newswire very close to where i was in south florida at the time that there were two hospitals
[3:52:01.640 --> 3:52:08.600]  specifically bokeh regional and bethesda east these are very large medical centers with a campus
[3:52:08.600 --> 3:52:13.800]  this is not like a tiny little rural hospital and they were saying over the this this national
[3:52:13.800 --> 3:52:19.320]  newswire that both hospitals were were just you know uh overflowing their morgues were so
[3:52:19.320 --> 3:52:24.920]  overwhelmed with covid patients that were dying uh that they had to have refrigerated trucks to
[3:52:24.920 --> 3:52:31.400]  store them outside uh and and that it was the hospitals were in total chaos so i put an all
[3:52:31.400 --> 3:52:35.880]  call out on my social media and then i thought you know what i'm less than an hour away i'm gonna
[3:52:35.880 --> 3:52:41.800]  drive down there went down there i gotta tell you stew it was just unbelievable to behold both
[3:52:41.800 --> 3:52:47.080]  hospital campuses uh one was on saturday one was on sunday they look like zen gardens when i tell
[3:52:47.080 --> 3:52:53.240]  you that the ambulance bay yeah the ambulance bay which is this large area where multiple many
[3:52:53.240 --> 3:52:58.440]  multiple ambulances can pull in pull in back out take out patients move them you know if they have
[3:52:58.440 --> 3:53:04.600]  to go to the center more the you know downtown or something these bays were were empty the front doors
[3:53:04.600 --> 3:53:09.640]  were empty it looked it just looked like a resort i almost sat down and you know just had a had a
[3:53:09.640 --> 3:53:15.720]  cold one okay and then found that the refrigerated truck there was only one of them if you want to
[3:53:15.720 --> 3:53:21.800]  call an air conditioned mobile MRI unit was really the only truck in the back of the hospital because
[3:53:21.800 --> 3:53:31.000]  we drove all around both hospitals and we saw just one aac you know um a mobile MRI unit and i spoke
[3:53:31.000 --> 3:53:37.480]  to some of the a couple of the police officers that were standing outside of boca regional again
[3:53:37.480 --> 3:53:43.720]  very large and we i asked them if they were aware of this they said absolutely not that's a totally
[3:53:43.720 --> 3:53:51.640]  bogus story also caught some ambulance driver that it coming out of just another like a parking lot
[3:53:51.640 --> 3:53:56.520]  and flagged him from our car and rolled down the window and asked them if they had heard of the
[3:53:56.520 --> 3:54:03.080]  morgues overflowing uh and and they started to laugh the two driver or the two ambulance emt's
[3:54:03.080 --> 3:54:07.560]  looked at each other like i didn't i didn't see that uh the police officer said that's why you came
[3:54:07.560 --> 3:54:12.360]  down here and i said yeah because it sounded like you're in dire straits and they just i'm gonna tell
[3:54:12.360 --> 3:54:17.160]  you i want everybody to know i just i want everybody to know where this all came from okay
[3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:24.680]  because these people need to be mocked and held accountable for this yes this guy this guy this

[3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:09.000]  kids heads to report this stuff he's going along with this narrative uh but this guy's a low level
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:15.720]  pos uh that's just regurgitating the the mainstream talking point nonsense and that is so dangerous
[3:55:15.720 --> 3:55:22.680]  it is so dangerous for everybody who's unsuspecting florida is very far away but one of the uh most
[3:55:22.680 --> 3:55:28.920]  elderly populations in our union is florida these people are easily manipulated by shocking
[3:55:28.920 --> 3:55:35.160]  headlines like that and this guy andrew colton is no different than andrew quomo leading people
[3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:40.680]  into their certain death uh this i got to wrap this up so by the way the the war room is coming
[3:55:40.680 --> 3:55:43.720]  up next with oan shroyer but i want to wrap up with something else before we go i got about
[3:55:43.720 --> 3:55:49.080]  two minutes and i want to make sure that we get to this the fda has added a black box warning a
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:56.840]  black box warning to the shots tell us what this is well this is a big admission stew that that the
[3:55:57.560 --> 3:56:04.280]  rates of myocarditis and pericarditis the pericardium the sac around the heart uh is is the
[3:56:04.280 --> 3:56:11.240]  numbers are so huge uh and exploding that that the cbc had to admit it uh the fda put out actually
[3:56:11.240 --> 3:56:18.840]  got ahead of the m mr the the morbidity mortality weekly report that came out july 30th on june 25th
[3:56:18.840 --> 3:56:25.080]  the fda actually came out with this black box black's warning uh that that goes on the fact sheet
[3:56:25.080 --> 3:56:30.440]  since there is no package insert uh it's calling attention to the risks that are that are much
[3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:37.720]  higher than previously thought no kidding of myocarditis in watch this 12 to 17 year olds and so
[3:56:37.720 --> 3:56:42.280]  when if there was a package insert which i've explained on the show before when you get a black
[3:56:42.280 --> 3:56:48.200]  box warning it's the very first thing under the name of the drug and it's usually reserved for uh
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:55.160]  severe risk factors uh high levels of serious adverse events this is an admission of the of
[3:56:55.160 --> 3:57:03.560]  the cdc and the fda but they're not stopping it stew yeah and i gotta be curious as well as to why
[3:57:03.560 --> 3:57:07.960]  all of a sudden this thing would be added i mean that there's certainly some sort of an
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:12.520]  ulterior motive you have to take a step back and look at these globalist freak shows these
[3:57:12.520 --> 3:57:19.560]  psychopath murderers these serial killing uh narcissistic uh members of this cabal and you
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:25.560]  have to wonder why would they start putting warnings out there why maybe we need to slow this down
[3:57:25.560 --> 3:57:28.920]  maybe we need to take a step back maybe too many people are going to suffer from this
[3:57:28.920 --> 3:57:34.680]  antibody dependent enhancement we don't want the body stacking up too high all stuff to think
[3:57:34.680 --> 3:57:40.200]  about dr jane ruby thank you so much yeah thank you so much for being here really appreciate it
[3:57:40.200 --> 3:57:51.160]  own schreuer is coming up next the war room right here don't go anywhere
