[00:49.080 --> 00:55.640]  the news we've got guests joining us today Stacy Malcon from Proposition 37 in California that is
[00:55.640 --> 01:01.080]  the proposition that is attempting to require GMOs to be labeled on foods so that consumers can
[01:01.080 --> 01:07.000]  choose not to eat poison yes wouldn't that be a nice choice to have but of course the food industry
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.920]  is lining up against that proposition and we'll talk about whether that's likely to pass and then
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.440]  we've got Anthony Gutiarty from Natural Society joining us today with some breaking news from
[01:18.440 --> 01:26.040]  scientists who support GMOs yes they've sent us emails now that say they know GMOs are killing you
[01:26.040 --> 01:32.520]  that's what they want that's the goal and this is openly admitted by a member of the scientific
[01:32.520 --> 01:37.320]  community will have that email and those details breaking right here on the Alex Jones show in

[01:48.120 --> 01:53.960]  in case Fukushima gets worse or in case there's another nuclear disaster somewhere in the world
[01:53.960 --> 01:58.920]  which could happen lots of causes behind it so we'll get into that also how to protect yourself
[01:58.920 --> 02:06.120]  from MSG yeah monosodium glutamate also sometimes in the form of free glutamate in your foods it's
[02:06.120 --> 02:12.680]  an excitotoxin you've heard guests like Dr. Russell Blalock a neurosurgeon right here on the Alex Jones
[02:12.680 --> 02:17.720]  show talking about the toxicity of MSG but no one's ever been able to really describe how to
[02:17.720 --> 02:23.160]  protect yourself from MSG but some interesting new research has come out that I'm going to cover in
[02:23.160 --> 02:30.520]  the third hour that has a lot of promise for how to protect yourself from MSG with a supplement
[02:31.240 --> 02:38.280]  and we'll talk about that plus also today we've got news about motorists being detained for paying
[02:38.280 --> 02:46.440]  cash at toll booths yeah cash is now something that makes you a criminal we've got children

[02:58.360 --> 03:03.720]  you need more painkillers gee I wonder who designed that system big pharma maybe we've
[03:03.720 --> 03:09.640]  got news about a new desktop fabrication machine a desktop replicator that can actually produce
[03:09.640 --> 03:14.680]  physical objects just like printing out pages on a bubble jet printer it's just been announced
[03:14.680 --> 03:20.280]  and I'm going to talk to you share with you some of the implications of that technology and what it
[03:20.280 --> 03:26.360]  means for our economy and our world it's a bigger deal than you might suspect just from hearing the

[04:08.840 --> 04:15.720]  warrantless DNA collection that's been going on in the police state here the court of California is
[04:15.720 --> 04:21.000]  now going to reconsider whether that is allowed based on new findings that say there's no such
[04:21.000 --> 04:27.240]  thing as junk DNA most of your DNA has been described as quote junk DNA but it turns out that DNA
[04:27.240 --> 04:32.840]  may be able to describe traits and they can learn a lot of things about you by collecting that DNA
[04:32.840 --> 04:38.200]  without using a warrant so that's being challenged in New Jersey there are attempts to strip parental
[04:38.200 --> 04:42.680]  rights over vaccine exemptions they don't want you to have a choice they don't want you to be able

[08:35.080 --> 08:40.840]  this is mike adams the health ranger filling in for alex today and for the next three hours
[08:40.840 --> 08:48.840]  we are going to present a whirlwind of news and guests interviews plus your calls in the third
[08:48.840 --> 08:54.360]  hour as well so if you've got calls for me uh get them ready we'll take your calls in the third hour
[08:55.240 --> 09:00.440]  on just about any topic that you'd like to talk about in the meantime here's what's coming up
[09:00.440 --> 09:06.600]  today we've got stacy malkin a spokesperson for proposition 37 in california joining us
[09:06.600 --> 09:12.600]  at the bottom of this hour that is the proposition of course that talks about requiring gmo labeling
[09:12.600 --> 09:18.280]  on foods in california and has nationwide implications we've also got anthony gucci already
[09:18.280 --> 09:23.560]  coming up in the second hour with breaking news about gmo's scientists admitting that they really
[09:23.560 --> 09:28.840]  do want to kill people and cause infertility and that hey the fewer people that are left
[09:28.840 --> 09:35.640]  standing after all the gmo's are dispensed and and fed to you the better we all are according to
[09:35.640 --> 09:42.600]  these scientists so it's not even really a question about whether gmo's are in fact dangerous or if
[09:42.600 --> 09:48.840]  they cause these cancer tumors as has been shown in recent studies it's actually true that the
[09:48.840 --> 09:54.520]  scientists want you to die so we'll talk about that it's incredible nothing nothing shocks me
[09:54.520 --> 09:59.240]  anymore because they literally just want to kill humanity it's an anti-human technology we'll get
[09:59.240 --> 10:04.120]  into that the news is coming up by the way but first um in the third hour also we've got ted
[10:04.120 --> 10:09.160]  anderson joining us and then some great news about how to protect yourself from radiation and from
[10:09.160 --> 10:17.480]  msg so let's get right into the news uh bill clinton says no president could have magically
[10:17.480 --> 10:24.600]  fixed the economy in one term i guess he's now an obama apologist is that it well of course
[10:24.600 --> 10:33.480]  you can't fix the economy in one term if you're a global bankster sellout um and anybody who expects
[10:33.480 --> 10:40.360]  romney to fix the economy is living in a dreamland as well senate votes to shield us airlines from
[10:40.360 --> 10:46.760]  e use carbon scheme that should be an interesting battle over whether us airlines can actually be
[10:46.760 --> 10:54.520]  charged money for emitting carbon dioxide an extra carbon dioxide tax that's coming in many forms
[10:54.520 --> 11:00.680]  all across america and around the world uh here's what else is coming up obama says he's blocking out
[11:00.680 --> 11:09.320]  the israeli noise it's just noise don't worry about uh the possibility of nuclear war over there
[11:09.320 --> 11:16.040]  and and iran and syria and everything that's going on it's it's just noise so go back to sleep
[11:16.040 --> 11:22.040]  americans and vote for more hope and more change because i guess we haven't had enough hope in the
[11:22.040 --> 11:32.280]  last four years we need yet more hope we do need some change that that is for sure but uh okay moving
[11:32.280 --> 11:37.080]  on court rules motorists can be detained for paying by cash at toll booths this is a big deal
[11:37.640 --> 11:44.360]  paul joseph watson article up right now at info wars dot com the 11th circuit us court of appeals
[11:44.360 --> 11:52.760]  has ruled that private contractors operating toll booths have the power to detain and store records
[11:52.760 --> 12:01.080]  on motorists as detained motorists in other words arrest them who pay by cash at toll booths so uh
[12:01.080 --> 12:07.160]  it's cash is now the great evil do you see where this is going if you use cash it's evil now this
[12:07.160 --> 12:13.720]  particular motorist was he was trying to pay with it looks like a fifty dollar bill or maybe a hundred
[12:13.720 --> 12:19.560]  dollar bill something larger than a 20 and they said well we can't take that those large bills are
[12:19.560 --> 12:25.960]  evil and so they detained him they they essentially arrested him this is in addition to another
[12:25.960 --> 12:32.920]  case that happened recently when walmart cashier ripped up the 100 dollar bill of a customer there
[12:33.560 --> 12:38.520]  trying to prove that it was counterfeit but it wasn't it was a real hundred dollar bill
[12:38.520 --> 12:44.120]  and then the police were called and walmart was ordered to replace the hundred dollar bill that
[12:44.120 --> 12:49.880]  they ripped up you see where this is so those of us who use cash which includes myself by the way i
[12:49.880 --> 12:55.480]  use cash everywhere i frequently use hundred dollar bills frequently use fifty dollar bills
[12:55.480 --> 13:00.760]  and uh i've never had a problem with it but i'm an adult shop at walmart and i don't go through
[13:00.760 --> 13:06.040]  these tollways so uh maybe when i do that i'm going to be arrested but the point is they want to make
[13:06.040 --> 13:13.640]  you think you're a criminal for using cash just carrying cash is is now described as being a criminal
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.400]  see they want you to all use electronic money because it's trackable because it's traceable
[13:19.960 --> 13:25.480]  the evil of cash that's being propagandized out there is because cash is anonymous cash is
[13:25.480 --> 13:33.800]  untraceable cash is the currency of well freedom in a sense that and uh bitcoin of course uh moving
[13:33.800 --> 13:41.240]  on oh yeah here's another coverage of that at ten news uh same story motorist it's getting coverage
[13:41.240 --> 13:46.920]  it in the mainstream media in fact i'm told we have a short video clip on that let's roll that
[13:46.920 --> 13:56.440]  see what the video shows us this is from wtsb.com with a larger bill like a 20 or 100 and you may
[13:56.440 --> 14:00.840]  have to fork over personal information as ten news investigative reporter mike decent has
[14:00.840 --> 14:05.400]  discovered the florida department of transportation has essentially been doing that and tried to cover
[14:05.400 --> 14:11.240]  it up when it was caught the toll taker says this is what happens when you give large bills like
[14:11.240 --> 14:16.840]  that it's what we have to do meet joel chandler who just paid his one dollar toll on the polk
[14:16.840 --> 14:21.960]  parkway with a one hundred dollar bill and he's not being allowed to leave unless he provides
[14:21.960 --> 14:27.160]  personal information to the toll taker so you all detain people until you get their personal
[14:27.160 --> 14:32.520]  information yes sir it's a policy the florida turnpike authority instituted for people who
[14:32.520 --> 14:47.480]  paid with 20 50 or 100 dollar bills you give me the information you can go this is a serious
[14:47.480 --> 14:52.840]  serious criminal offense to illegally detain somebody without legal authority which is
[14:52.840 --> 14:57.320]  exactly what they're doing chandler called and emailed the florida department of transportation
[14:57.320 --> 15:02.920]  to complain about the policy their initial response was there is no policy to do this which
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.120]  really may be concerned because it appeared that they were just individual rogue toll booth workers
[15:08.120 --> 15:13.400]  that were you know detaining people but the practice continued at toll booth after toll booth
[15:13.400 --> 15:19.320]  and if someone refused to provide the information they were threatened with arrest i can call fhp
[15:19.320 --> 15:26.280]  and they can come here and give you that information would you like for me to do that okay so this
[15:26.280 --> 15:32.920]  this goes on you can watch this on youtube if you want but the point is that you see how they're
[15:32.920 --> 15:40.200]  criminalizing you there they are arresting you for paying with legal tender that is is marked as
[15:40.200 --> 15:45.640]  the currency of the well the federal reserve i guess that's another story but hey if they're
[15:45.640 --> 15:51.400]  going to accept counterfeit one dollar bills from the fed and counterfeit five dollar bills or fiat
[15:51.400 --> 15:57.560]  currency is what i mean then they should accept fiat hundred dollar bills oh you know so this
[15:57.560 --> 16:03.800]  again it's the criminalization of everything that's normal in america today so are you exercising
[16:03.800 --> 16:08.680]  free speech are you are you protesting somewhere out in public you're a criminal there's i was talking
[16:08.680 --> 16:14.440]  to dan badandi out out here during the break and he was talking about how they're trying to just film
[16:14.440 --> 16:19.960]  in a public place and they're always threatened with uh by the the cops and the security people
[16:19.960 --> 16:24.760]  they're threatened to say you can't film here why oh because we say so because you're a criminal for
[16:24.760 --> 16:30.120]  filming here yeah you're a member of the press but you're a criminal so if you use cash if you
[16:31.080 --> 16:37.720]  drink raw milk let's say if you're a farmer if you film in public in filming something they
[16:37.720 --> 16:42.440]  don't want you to film all of a sudden you're a criminal this is it this is the mass criminalization
[16:42.440 --> 16:47.960]  of america underway and they're going to force everybody into using their currency controlled
[16:47.960 --> 16:56.280]  electronic systems the rfid chips embedded in your palm or in your arm or electronic wallets
[16:56.920 --> 17:01.880]  that's where it's all going so check out that story at info wars dot com let's move on pain
[17:01.880 --> 17:07.160]  killers are the cause of millions of headaches this has come out from a a new study this is
[17:07.160 --> 17:13.240]  published in bbc news as well uh this is that vicious cycle you know a lot of drugs actually
[17:13.240 --> 17:18.920]  cause the very things that they claim to prevent for example we know that many drugs that claim to
[17:18.920 --> 17:24.600]  treat osteoporosis actually cause fragile bones many drugs that claim to treat inflammation
[17:24.600 --> 17:30.760]  actually cause inflammation diabetes drugs cause long-term diabetes and psychiatric drugs also
[17:30.760 --> 17:38.680]  cause diabetes but pain killers cause headaches all right you got that this is the scam uh chemotherapy
[17:38.680 --> 17:45.160]  causes cancer it's the number one side effect of chemotherapy mammograms cause cancer they emit
[17:45.160 --> 17:50.760]  ionizing radiation they irradiate the lungs and the liver and the heart and the breast tissue
[17:50.760 --> 17:55.080]  mammograms cause cancer that's why the cancer industry loves to push mammograms because it's a
[17:55.080 --> 18:02.200]  repeat business gimmick it's a scam it's a it's a crime against women if you ask me but anyway
[18:02.200 --> 18:08.280]  this is all coming out pain killers cause headaches i think just reading the financial news causes
[18:08.280 --> 18:16.520]  headaches makes you want to take some painkillers of course we don't do that around here medication
[18:16.520 --> 18:22.520]  free for over a decade that's true in fact i haven't had vaccines for like a dozen years something
[18:22.520 --> 18:26.760]  like that i mean when i was a kid i got vaccines because i just didn't know any better but i haven't
[18:26.760 --> 18:33.240]  had vaccines for as long as i can remember and i never get sick so go figure all right here check
[18:33.240 --> 18:41.240]  this out the replicator two has just been announced by makerbot.com and i know this probably sounds
[18:41.240 --> 18:47.080]  like a plug for them but it's really a news item here here's why this matters the replicator is a
[18:47.080 --> 18:53.800]  desktop 3d printer it's a fabrication device that sits on your desk and it literally prints 3d objects
[18:53.800 --> 19:00.520]  using strings of basically a type of plastic it makes hard plastic items now why is this a big deal

[24:45.640 --> 24:54.040]  report on this for the night we do is it's such a gigantic issue uh that i was at a coffee shop
[24:54.040 --> 24:58.520]  a chain coffee shop i probably shouldn't have been in uh just a few weeks ago and bought like
[24:58.520 --> 25:03.880]  25 dollars worth of stuff and they tried to not take my 50 and call the manager and act
[25:03.880 --> 25:09.000]  it like i was a criminal uh of course walmarts rip up your money now if you try to use cash
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.880]  they're arresting people they use two dollar bills they're arresting people that even show people
[25:13.880 --> 25:20.360]  silver coins um they are now arresting people nationwide that write political slogans with
[25:20.360 --> 25:25.320]  chalk on the sidewalk they're now arresting people nationwide to film police in public
[25:25.320 --> 25:32.280]  they're now calling the police on my crew when they're on major streets in austin in suits video
[25:32.280 --> 25:38.840]  taping we have a three country the last messages are being removed but in that report out of florida
[25:39.560 --> 25:46.840]  people paying with cash with five dollars are having the police called on them and people
[25:46.840 --> 25:50.920]  are being held by the little bureaucrat people to just shut their car down there and just walk
[25:50.920 --> 25:56.760]  the whole toll road we've discovered toll roads run by foreign companies like centra are actually
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.720]  buying up hundreds of newspapers just here in texas hundreds over 200 and actually running
[26:01.720 --> 26:07.880]  mayors and people and taking over the town we are wide open we've been infiltrated by criminal
[26:07.880 --> 26:15.720]  corporate interest and it's time to say no hell no and when you look at the fact that in california
[26:15.720 --> 26:20.520]  and now new jersey they're injecting children without parental consent they're giving a morning
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.760]  after pills without parental consent or taking them for abortions without parental consent
[26:25.880 --> 26:30.200]  and they're now announcing they want to just force shots on us this is a lawless
[26:30.200 --> 26:35.160]  group of criminals trying to break our will and here's the thing for all the idiots that say
[26:35.160 --> 26:39.400]  well i'll just pay with a credit card what do i have to hide once they have you with pure digital
[26:39.400 --> 26:44.120]  money they can deny you buying and selling if you're not a good globalist and they've said
[26:44.120 --> 26:48.440]  they'll do that here's the final key and i want you back to those so you have breaking news coming up
[26:49.560 --> 26:55.640]  they can also like bank of america wanted to charge you up to five dollars just to use
[26:56.440 --> 27:01.320]  your own money folks you're gonna be paying to use money now not just getting zero percent interest
[27:01.320 --> 27:08.280]  of banks this is a systematic takeover and hundreds of studies showing gmo's cost sterilization
[27:08.280 --> 27:14.120]  because they're designed to and all these top scientists from gmo companies constantly brag
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.640]  as mike was pointing out he has proof coming up when they say hey this is sterilizing all the rats
[27:19.640 --> 27:25.080]  they go yeah what do you think we're doing they're they're they're back storing all this tech
[27:25.080 --> 27:31.240]  with these traits into the food we're dead already you're in a so-called horror movie it's hardcore
[27:31.240 --> 27:36.280]  beyond belief most people are in a zombie state you're not gonna reach them most people are
[27:36.280 --> 27:41.160]  power tripping brain damage minions who have been given their their their their little brainwashed
[27:41.160 --> 27:49.320]  role template they follow you are in a science fiction movie people it's 2012 we are under attack
[27:49.320 --> 27:54.440]  our own species has a subgroup that thinks that they're a separate species in their own words
[27:54.440 --> 27:58.680]  and that we're animals to be killed they're murdering you and your family you're all being
[27:58.680 --> 28:05.400]  poised i'm sorry mike i've been off no it's good three days and i'm chomping to do a special report

[28:10.280 --> 28:15.240]  i'll stay on i got a question for you the other thing about this not accepting cash at toll booths
[28:15.240 --> 28:21.560]  is when you use electronic payment systems they know where you are and they know you're not at home
[28:21.560 --> 28:25.320]  that way you know how the prison they want to fill the prisons because the corporations own the
[28:25.320 --> 28:30.280]  prisons and produce the products now they can simply go to your home when when they know you're
[28:30.280 --> 28:35.640]  not there plant drugs there have you arrested and they can arrange all of this exactly look at how
[28:35.640 --> 28:42.520]  they're shutting down on us truck farms lemonade stands data right low easy and criminalizing
[28:42.520 --> 28:48.120]  cash and secondhand sales we are prisoners we have been captured we are prisoners we have been
[28:48.120 --> 28:53.000]  captured many day many day many day god bless you mike keep it up thank you for coming into the best

[29:00.280 --> 29:05.720]  it's hard it's hard to overstate the the degree of charity that we are under the the degree of
[29:05.720 --> 29:11.800]  oppression that we are living under here and you know alex is right i mean that's why his his attitude
[29:11.800 --> 29:17.320]  is so effective here on the show that why he has so many fans and listeners because you know this
[29:17.320 --> 29:21.960]  this is something that we should be screaming about this is insane what's going on in our world
[29:21.960 --> 29:26.680]  how we're being poisoned by our food poisoned by the quote scientific vaccines how we're being
[29:26.680 --> 29:31.880]  criminalized for using cash and criminalized for exercising free speech writing things online
[29:31.880 --> 29:36.280]  that the establishment doesn't like uh posting things on facebook they get you arrested and
[29:36.280 --> 29:42.440]  thrown in a mental institution he's right to scream about it there's no calm way to really

[33:47.240 --> 33:53.560]  here's something that drives me crazy it's infuriating new york city schools give out
[33:53.560 --> 34:00.920]  morning after pills to students in 13 high schools by giving morning after pills and
[34:00.920 --> 34:10.280]  birth control injections to girls without telling their parents and less parents opt out beforehand
[34:10.280 --> 34:19.640]  so so and i guess they're doing this to girls as young as what uh 14 13 or 14 is what i read before
[34:21.000 --> 34:26.360]  so think about this think about this i mean parents you're you're out of the loop man
[34:26.920 --> 34:31.400]  these schools are injecting your children they're giving them birth control they're giving them a
[34:31.400 --> 34:37.720]  completely fictitious education too by the way a completely fictionalized history of america
[34:37.720 --> 34:42.280]  and they're teaching them to worship big government they're giving them toxic food
[34:42.280 --> 34:47.080]  additives in the school lunches and then they're teaching them basically to go out and have sex
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.560]  when they're 14 years old and get pregnant and don't worry there are no consequences because
[34:51.560 --> 34:57.640]  you can come in and you can ask the school nurse for an abortion pill now regardless of what you
[34:57.640 --> 35:05.400]  think about abortion or or when does life begin in that entire debate shouldn't parents have the
[35:05.400 --> 35:12.600]  the say in this since when did schools and government run the bodies of our young daughters
[35:12.600 --> 35:16.840]  in schools that's infuriating and if you've got a comment on that we're going to open up
[35:16.840 --> 35:21.640]  third hour here for phone calls so save that thought i'd love to have your comments on that

[35:47.640 --> 35:53.880]  well the corporate the big food giants out there they want that label to say none of your business
[35:53.880 --> 36:00.040]  they want to poison you with gmo's and do it in stealth mode secretly deceptively so that you
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.360]  don't even know what you're eating and you can't even have a choice to know what you're eating
[36:04.360 --> 36:09.400]  but to fight that we've got proposition 37 which so far is going pretty well in california and

[36:47.000 --> 36:52.840]  10 week period and that was twice the number we needed to get on the ballot that was a huge undertaking
[36:52.840 --> 36:57.320]  by thousands of volunteers across the state and many of the moms and grandmothers who are not
[36:57.320 --> 37:02.360]  usually out on the streets petitioning but they care so much about this issue because they want to
[37:02.360 --> 37:07.720]  know what's in their food because we have a right to know and as you said the companies have been
[37:07.720 --> 37:13.480]  genetically engineering our food system you know fundamentally altering the genetic code of some of
[37:13.480 --> 37:20.680]  our most important food crops without any required safety studies and without telling us so this is
[37:20.680 --> 37:26.840]  a huge importance a lot of the food on supermarket shelves baby formula kids corn chips cereal all
[37:26.840 --> 37:31.800]  sorts of foods are genetically engineered and that's been hidden well yeah just just about every
[37:31.800 --> 37:36.520]  i'm sorry to rub it just about everything with corn in it is genetically engineered and i'm sure
[37:36.520 --> 37:42.920]  you you saw the study last week from french researchers that they fed these rats a lifetime
[37:42.920 --> 37:49.560]  of genetically modified corn and those rats grew these grotesque just horrifying massive tumors so
[37:49.560 --> 37:54.920]  large that they had to literally drag drag the tumors with them as they tried to crawl across
[37:54.920 --> 37:59.560]  the floor i mean it was sickening that what are your thoughts on that research god well that is a
[37:59.560 --> 38:06.760]  hugely important study because i mean stunningly it's the first long-term animal study on gmo that
[38:06.760 --> 38:13.400]  has been in the american diet for 15 years um and they found very concerning results mammary tumors
[38:13.400 --> 38:19.240]  as well as liver and kidney problems and also premature death so the findings were stunning
[38:19.240 --> 38:24.440]  and the study is getting a lot of critiques it was a small study and all this but so important
[38:24.440 --> 38:29.400]  to point out that the industry is using the same study design for their studies and they're very
[38:29.400 --> 38:34.040]  short term studies so what's happening is they're doing these short term studies finding indications
[38:34.040 --> 38:39.000]  of liver and kidney problems and then what's the responsible thing to do if that's the case if you
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.040]  really want to investigate what's the health effect is something you do a longer term study
[38:44.040 --> 38:51.000]  they don't want to know um so the science has been suppressed and hidden and now we have this
[38:51.000 --> 38:56.840]  first long-term feeding study showing really stunning results stacey it's it's infuriating
[38:56.840 --> 39:04.280]  to know that this corn got into the food supply without a long-term animal study ever being conducted
[39:04.280 --> 39:10.440]  how on earth did that happen where humans are eating this food for what could be a lifetime
[39:11.000 --> 39:16.760]  but yet it was never studied beyond 90 days i mean that is insane that's scientifically insane
[39:16.760 --> 39:21.720]  it that's a great way to put it scientifically insane i agree that the way it happened was
[39:21.720 --> 39:27.560]  back in the 90s when the vice president at the time dan quail announced the government's policy
[39:27.560 --> 39:33.320]  on gmo's and he said you know we're gonna treat these foods the same as regular foods and so
[39:33.320 --> 39:38.040]  therefore we don't need to do safety studies and they don't need to be labeled i mean that and and
[39:38.040 --> 39:44.040]  okay not surprisingly the policy was written by a former monsanto lawyer michael taylor who then
[39:44.040 --> 39:50.360]  when he left the bush the administration went to work as a vp at monsanto and now he's back at fda
[39:50.360 --> 39:55.240]  under the obama administration i mean it's just incredible the power these companies have had
[39:55.800 --> 40:01.720]  over a government policies over the science because you you also independent scientists
[40:01.720 --> 40:09.000]  can't research this stuff because of the patent restrictions um and it just the fda policy on its
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.200]  face they're saying it's the same as regular food yet monsanto spending how much money researching
[40:14.200 --> 40:18.280]  and patenting these seeds that are fundamentally different than from anything that's existed in
[40:18.280 --> 40:21.960]  the food system before well yeah they're not only fundamentally different i mean they're
[40:21.960 --> 40:26.840]  fundamentally toxic and that's that's what it looks like the study is showing fundamentally
[40:26.840 --> 40:33.160]  you know poisonous i mean how do you make a seed that grows poison in in the kernel of the corn
[40:33.160 --> 40:40.040]  which is what kills the insects that try to eat it and then you say feed it to your children great
[40:40.040 --> 40:44.760]  question and you know most of this is in process foods right now but people should also know that
[40:44.760 --> 40:50.440]  just this summer walmart decided it would sell monsanto's first genetically engineered sweet
[40:50.440 --> 40:55.320]  corn so in the supermarket the corn on the cob that you know looks the same as the corn on the cob
[40:55.320 --> 41:01.000]  we've eaten our whole life if you buy it at walmart it could be very different because it was engineered
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.280]  to contain like you were saying an insecticide inside the corn i think people want to know that
[41:06.280 --> 41:11.080]  and they have a right to know and so there's all this you know everybody's talking about the science
[41:11.080 --> 41:16.280]  and the concerns raised by this study and and absolutely this stuff needs rigorous long-term
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.760]  research but in the meantime what we're saying california is let's at least give people the
[41:20.760 --> 41:27.880]  right to know a choice a label well the the corporate science is and is not science it is
[41:27.880 --> 41:33.480]  complete fraud it is quack science junk science whatever you want to call it i have never seen
[41:33.480 --> 41:41.320]  such despicable unethical behavior among scientists as i've seen those defending attempting to defend
[41:41.320 --> 41:48.600]  these toxic gmo's these people will lie they will fabricate data and results they they will threaten
[41:48.600 --> 41:52.360]  you i mean i've been threatened others have been threatened the guests we have coming on next hour
[41:52.360 --> 41:58.680]  has been threatened these people will do anything and they and and you should stay tuned stacy for
[41:58.680 --> 42:02.920]  the next hour because we've got an email from one of these scientists who says yeah we know it kills
[42:02.920 --> 42:09.000]  you that's what we're trying to accomplish that's what they're saying it's just crazy stuff i mean
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.040]  well what i've seen over the last week industries trotting out all these scientists who are questioning
[42:14.040 --> 42:19.000]  the methods and the size of the study without mentioning that it's the same methods in size
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.920]  is all the industry studies that supposedly show safety which again are just 90 day studies and the
[42:24.920 --> 42:30.120]  tumors in this new print study didn't even show up until four months so if you were going to design
[42:30.120 --> 42:35.240]  a study that wouldn't find health affection or keep it short term decide which of those studies
[42:35.240 --> 42:39.640]  are going to get published then which aren't it's just truly incredible how much power these
[42:39.640 --> 42:45.720]  companies have but now what we see in california is they're now going to pour 32 million dollars
[42:45.720 --> 42:52.920]  into a live campaign to try to confuse voters about prop 37 which is a simple basic labeling
[42:52.920 --> 42:57.320]  law that's already required in 50 other countries of course of course there's going to be a lying
[42:57.320 --> 43:01.880]  campaign let's talk about that what are the what are the biggest lies that we should be prepared to
[43:01.880 --> 43:07.240]  hear from the propaganda campaign funded by all of these big food companies all the big names that
[43:07.240 --> 43:13.160]  you that you know uh they're they're going to lie to the california voters in the next four weeks
[43:13.160 --> 43:18.200]  or so what what are the big lies that we're likely to hear stacey so so first of all the two largest
[43:18.200 --> 43:24.120]  funders monsanto and dupont of the no one 37 campaign the same companies that told us dbt and
[43:24.120 --> 43:29.640]  agent orange were safe and produce science to that effect so now they've got this huge campaign
[43:29.640 --> 43:35.880]  of deception in california interestingly uh none of their ads mentioned genetic engineering that's
[43:35.880 --> 43:41.560]  the topic they don't want to discuss instead they're trying to say oh the initiative is confusing
[43:41.560 --> 43:46.360]  and it will raise a cost and people would get sued and this is all not true 32 million dollars can buy
[43:46.360 --> 43:53.000]  a lot of um confusion and misleading information but it can't buy facts and the facts are that this
[43:53.000 --> 43:59.000]  is a very simple straightforward business friendly proposition it won't raise costs there's absolutely
[43:59.000 --> 44:04.920]  no evidence uh to that effect cost didn't go up in europe when they implemented labeling um it's
[44:04.920 --> 44:10.440]  very fair to businesses and that's why thousands of farmers are behind the yes on 37 campaign the
[44:10.440 --> 44:15.400]  largest environmental and health groups in the state were funded by many many businesses across
[44:15.400 --> 44:21.160]  the state businesses in the natural organic food industry which is like the crown jewel of california's
[44:21.160 --> 44:28.760]  economy these companies are saying like we in california are we leave the nation on important
[44:28.760 --> 44:34.440]  health and environmental issues this is one of the most important to win this in california
[44:34.440 --> 44:39.080]  to bring transparency and fairness to our food system we do need to win this and i i think we
[44:39.080 --> 44:44.680]  can win this so folks go to california or ca right to know dot org get involved there and if you're
[44:44.680 --> 44:49.080]  listening from california be sure to vote this is actually a good reason to vote even if you don't
[44:49.080 --> 44:55.960]  vote for the next presidential puppet uh vote for this proposition this is the reason to go vote
[44:55.960 --> 45:01.960]  now uh it's clear though stacey that the reason monsanto doesn't want this to pass is simply because
[45:01.960 --> 45:07.080]  they don't want people to know what they're eating now if you think about what if we applied this to
[45:07.080 --> 45:14.200]  everything what if the doctor that you visit let's say prescribed you a pharmaceutical but he said
[45:14.200 --> 45:17.800]  it's a secret what's in there we're not going to tell you the name of it and then you go to the
[45:17.800 --> 45:22.600]  pharmacy and you get your prescription filled but it's it's written in code and the pharmacist says
[45:22.600 --> 45:27.160]  well we don't want you to know what's in that bottle either you're supposed to take these drugs
[45:27.160 --> 45:31.160]  and let it be a mystery because it's a corporate secret you're not supposed to know what you're
[45:31.160 --> 45:36.120]  taking that would be the equivalent of what's happening with gmo's right now now i think most
[45:36.120 --> 45:40.920]  common sense people would say of course we have a right to know what we're swallowing it only makes
[45:40.920 --> 45:47.640]  sense absolutely absolutely and you know the biggest challenge for us and we are running
[45:47.640 --> 45:54.280]  far ahead in the polls right now 67 but the no campaign of lies has not truly begun yet they
[45:54.280 --> 45:58.520]  haven't started with the tv commercials and they'll be putting 32 million dollars into
[45:58.520 --> 46:04.840]  bombarding the state with deceptive tv commercials so for folks who want to help us win this fight
[46:04.840 --> 46:09.800]  and i truly think this is the food fight of our lives we may never get another chance to have such
[46:09.800 --> 46:14.680]  an impact on the food system just to bring transparency and so please do check out our
[46:14.680 --> 46:24.040]  website carighttoknow.org now here's here's here's another thing this issue is a people issue people
[46:24.040 --> 46:31.640]  versus the corporations now everybody that i know is in favor of honest labeling of foods
[46:31.640 --> 46:37.400]  what's beautiful about proposition 37 is that you've got the progressives behind it you've got
[46:37.400 --> 46:43.160]  the conservatives behind it you've you've got the libertarians behind it you've got scientists
[46:43.160 --> 46:48.360]  supporting it you've got moms and dads and everybody with children supporting it because
[46:48.360 --> 46:52.680]  they want to know what they're feeding their children of course this is an across the board
[46:52.680 --> 46:57.960]  issue of basic fundamental right to know which of course what your website is is named after
[46:57.960 --> 47:04.200]  i can you describe some of the the diversity of support that you're seeing for this proposition
[47:04.200 --> 47:09.800]  stacey well it's incredible the polls show across the country 90 percent of people want
[47:09.800 --> 47:14.760]  genetically engineered foods to be labeled and like you said that's republicans libertarians
[47:14.760 --> 47:23.000]  democrats it's all demographics people of faith see this is a religious issue because because
[47:23.000 --> 47:28.520]  it's tampering with the food system there are just so many reasons for support here farmers
[47:28.520 --> 47:34.120]  across the state as i mentioned businesses in california the largest businesses that are making
[47:34.120 --> 47:39.800]  that are doing sustainable farming and making natural products all saying it's time to bring
[47:39.800 --> 47:44.040]  transparency and fairness to our food system because we have a right to know people want to
[47:44.040 --> 47:48.920]  know when 90 percent of the people want something and these companies are telling us that we can't
[47:48.920 --> 47:53.720]  have it this is truly a test of our democracy do we have a democracy left and i think we will
[47:53.720 --> 48:00.520]  prevail in california but it's going to be a huge fight so if folks can join us join our website
[48:00.520 --> 48:05.800]  donate every little bit helps and it really is going to come down to money with this fight we've
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.200]  got to get our message on the air well and remember this is that the people brought this to
[48:10.840 --> 48:17.720]  to uh possible legislation i mean the legislators wouldn't bring this to the floor because they're
[48:17.720 --> 48:22.680]  all bought off by these corporate interests this is the people's effort across the board the people
[48:22.680 --> 48:28.840]  put this on the ballot directly absolutely and yeah it's incredible more than a million people have
[48:28.840 --> 48:35.400]  have asked fda to label gmo they won't do it 19 states including california have tried to pass
[48:35.960 --> 48:41.880]  laws they can't get it done because of the threats of lawsuits and intimidation tactics by the
[48:41.880 --> 48:48.360]  monsanto lobby wow monsanto has got to be stopped let me just say that on the record this that that
[48:48.360 --> 48:54.680]  is one of the most evil corporations in my view that has ever existed on this planet they threaten
[48:54.680 --> 49:00.840]  the entire future of life on our planet not just agriculture but human life as well um stacey if
[49:00.840 --> 49:06.360]  this proposition passes what's going to happen well i think that what's going to happen is first
[49:06.360 --> 49:11.880]  of all we'll see labeling in california i think there'll be huge pressure across the country
[49:11.880 --> 49:16.600]  other states have already said they're going to be putting forth bills i think we'll see the nude
[49:16.600 --> 49:23.800]  pressure on the fda i think there's no stopping this movement people are waking up to they're seeing
[49:23.800 --> 49:28.440]  kids with allergies they're seeing you know loved ones with chronic diseases and wondering what's
[49:28.440 --> 49:33.800]  going on and the people that i talked to out there who are the passion behind this movement the moms
[49:33.800 --> 49:40.520]  you know who are looking up online on websites like you or you know what's happening with our food
[49:40.520 --> 49:45.000]  why everything so much illness and starting to research and finding very disturbing things
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.120]  about gmo's and about chemicals in our food system and so i do think that we're seeing an
[49:50.120 --> 49:56.280]  awakening among um among consumers in general but largely women and moms who are the ones that are
[49:56.280 --> 50:01.000]  buying the food for families and the product for homes well they we don't want toxins in our food
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.480]  in our product they better wake up or they're they're their grandchildren they're going to be born
[50:05.480 --> 50:11.080]  as mutants i mean literally or they may not even have grandchildren they may not have children i mean
[50:11.080 --> 50:15.480]  if they don't wake up it's the end of the line for their genetic lineage i mean that's that's how
[50:15.480 --> 50:21.000]  serious this is well i think women are waking up and i think that you know this this what we're
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.680]  doing in california is a huge part of just reaching the tipping point because if we can win this i think
[50:26.680 --> 50:33.000]  that the pressure for change will be unstoppable um and you know we just have six weeks left but
[50:33.000 --> 50:41.160]  we need all the help that we can get well said stacey stacey malkin ca right to know.org visit
[50:41.160 --> 50:46.680]  their website folks help support this this this really matters and you know and by the way thanks
[50:46.680 --> 50:49.880]  for joining us stacey it's great to have you on the show thanks so much for having me and for all
[50:49.880 --> 50:54.760]  your work too Mike you bet all right we'll be right back a lot more straight ahead including more
[50:54.760 --> 51:00.360]  gmo news and scientists saying they do want to kill you with gmo's yeah they admit it all that
[51:00.360 --> 51:04.840]  straight ahead right here the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012
[51:04.840 --> 51:10.120]  marks the hottest half year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions
[51:10.120 --> 51:15.880]  not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost
[51:15.880 --> 51:20.600]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the
[51:20.600 --> 51:25.640]  only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost in today's prices by getting your own
[51:25.640 --> 51:30.840]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will
[51:30.840 --> 51:35.400]  have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply i recently increased my supply from

[54:56.280 --> 55:03.800]  spread knowledge that's what this is all about help spread awakening now we just wrapped up an
[55:03.800 --> 55:08.680]  interview with stacey malkin from proposition 37 and we're going to be joined very shortly
[55:08.680 --> 55:13.800]  by anthony gucciardi who's got that email that i've been referring to where a scientist says he
[55:13.800 --> 55:20.280]  really hopes that gmo's are effective at killing people that's their goal that's what wow i mean
[55:20.280 --> 55:25.560]  they they're they're they just come out and admit that yeah we know gmo's kill ya that's the plan
[55:26.200 --> 55:31.880]  eat more uh corn snacks and corn breakfast cereals kill yourself that's what they say
[55:32.760 --> 55:36.280]  but stacey mentioned something that i want to comment on first before we bring anthony in
[55:36.280 --> 55:42.200]  and she mentioned that even people of faith are concerned about gmo's and they should be
[55:42.200 --> 55:47.960]  and i did some research on this and i want to share some fascinating symbology that's going on
[55:47.960 --> 55:54.200]  with the gmo issue and some some symbols from scripture some of the stories from scripture
[55:55.400 --> 56:01.800]  this won't this will be real quick but check this out if you look at the garden of eden story
[56:01.800 --> 56:08.920]  and adam and the forbidden fruit and the tree of the knowledge tree of knowledge of good and evil
[56:08.920 --> 56:15.720]  that was there in the garden now the tree of knowledge of good and evil represents in my view
[56:15.720 --> 56:20.840]  at one level discernment being able to know the difference between what is good and what is evil
[56:20.840 --> 56:27.960]  the apple it was something that looked like healthy regular food but there was an evil element to it
[56:27.960 --> 56:36.360]  that was not visible that is gmo it looks like regular corn but there's poison in it now even
[56:36.360 --> 56:43.960]  worse it's not just poison in the garden of eden there was the serpent that was of course trying
[56:43.960 --> 56:50.520]  to uh to get adam to eat of the forbidden fruit and if you look at the symbol of western medicine
[56:51.080 --> 56:55.800]  that symbol is called the caduceus and i think we've got an image to show on screen for those of
[56:55.800 --> 57:01.480]  you watching on prismplanet.tv if you can show that symbol that'd be great there it is the caduceus
[57:01.480 --> 57:09.240]  is a symbol of two serpents intertwined two serpents intertwined and this symbol is found
[57:09.240 --> 57:16.360]  on the diploma of virtually every medical doctor in america the symbol is found in at every medical
[57:16.360 --> 57:23.400]  school it is emblazoned on virtually every medical text every medical journal in america you'll find
[57:23.400 --> 57:31.160]  this in doctor's offices these two serpents that are intertwined in the shape of dna in the shape
[57:31.160 --> 57:42.120]  of dna so what does it represent evil dna in a sense the a satanic influence over the seed
[57:42.120 --> 57:51.880]  of life and isn't that gmo isn't that what gmo really is a destructive demonic infiltration
[57:51.880 --> 57:57.400]  of the seeds of life that that support sustainable life on our planet so when you look back at the
[57:57.400 --> 58:03.400]  stories of the bible even though gmo's didn't exist back then obviously or even you know
[58:03.400 --> 58:09.400]  50 years ago today they do and those lessons still have merit today because we've got to
[58:09.400 --> 58:16.360]  watch out for food that is infected with pure evil and those symbols are all across western
[58:16.360 --> 58:22.680]  medicine tells you the truth about what medicine western medicine really stands for serpents and
[58:22.680 --> 58:29.160]  dna man it's right there it's right there on their diplomas i'm not making it up anyway we'll be back
[58:29.160 --> 58:34.600]  with anthony gucciardi right after this break and a lot more fascinating news about gmo scientists
[58:34.600 --> 58:45.800]  that say yep they want to kill you okay we'll find out why stay with us this is gcn the genesis

[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:20.040]  guest on info wars nightly news his website is natural society dot com and he's a very skilled
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:25.240]  researcher and a good writer too he's been able to put together a lot of fascinating articles
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:30.920]  about what's really happening behind the scenes with gmo's and other issues and he's got some
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:36.600]  uh some frightening well a frightening email to share with us today plus a lot of other information
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:42.120]  and we're going to go over this whole thing about gmo's and the anti-human technology
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:49.240]  that these scientists so-called scientists are trying to push on us anthony uh thanks for joining
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:54.040]  us today it's great to have you on thanks a lot for having on mike and i think it really is anti-human
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:59.720]  and as you'll see in this letter i i called it as well as you do a traitor against humanity these
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.920]  scientists who are essentially creating these gene altering foods that are in the food supply
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.400]  and they're really offended when we call them by that name as well that's why you can see
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:15.160]  the blind rage in this letter is amazing and he just thoroughly admits everything all right well
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:19.960]  lays it down we're going to save this letter until eight after because not not all the radio
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:25.640]  stations carry this particular segment so but i appreciate you uh bringing that to us here at
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.920]  info wars and it is shocking i've i've read the letter you sent it to me in advance and it's
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:36.520]  it's absolutely shocking but uh what are some of the big i've got a list here of some of what i
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.120]  want to cover but what are some of the big give us a preview of what we're going to talk about
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.160]  during this coming hour anthony well i think it's important that we revisit two key gmo studies and
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:50.280]  that's the wheat study and then the roundup study that was done in france and that france is now
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:56.440]  looking into and potentially calling for a worldwide ban on gmo's and with any luck they will do that
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:01.320]  it seems that they really have a backbone as opposed to the united states which is essentially
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:07.320]  co-opted by monsanto goons and pretty much every cabinet there is and then we can also talk about
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:12.360]  some of these ridiculous rebuttals to the study like this one guy saying that oh if gmo's were
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:18.120]  so bad then we'd see an increase in disease but we don't see that are you kidding me
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.840]  people are dropping like flies i have articles as far back as the 90 saying that a mysterious
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.840]  cause is going around killing people with cancer and brain tumors they don't know what it is
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:34.680]  and then an article just today that's saying basically for the first time which i don't even
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.680]  believe that's necessarily true if you consider the fact that people aren't really living they're
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:44.280]  really on life support for years these days um but for the first time children are now going to live
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:51.000]  of shorter than their parents so if we have to wonder why that's happening we can look to gmo's
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.800]  and every every other contaminant in the food supply oh yeah we've got a story here about um
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:00.600]  i think what was it an eight-year-old with ovarian cancer i mean we're talking about
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.960]  children being hit with diseases that normally would have only affected adults and even a hundred
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:10.360]  years ago those some of those diseases would have been completely unheard of and now they're common
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.800]  place and i don't think it's any coincidence that that uh french study specifically states that it
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.760]  kills women more quickly than men and causes massive memory tumors and everything like that so
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:26.360]  it's interesting how it targets the woman's reproductive system as well and kills them off
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:31.000]  with tumors and everything like that so it's it's amazing when you look at it how it all ties in
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.360]  together well that's that's how you kill a species you go after the women i mean you kill the women
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.520]  first and then you know the birth rate drops and that's the goal of these scientists they
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:46.840]  they openly admit it and we'll have a proof of that in an email that was sent to anthony
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:59.400]  when we come back so stay with us all that and much more straight ahead
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:08.440]  if you want an american company with american products made by americans

[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:57.160]  cause infertility and they know they might kill you but that's what they want they love it they
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:03.720]  want the gmo's to work it's like a food as a weapon in fact uh there's i wrote an article

[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:23.720]  years old and she's got ovarian cancer you know how sad is that and and how crazy is it that we've
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:30.760]  got little girls getting reproductive cancers that's that's not right something's wrong with that
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.240]  something's wrong with our planet and here to help us make sense of that is anthony gucciardi
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.560]  joining us by skype video anthony what do you think about this uh this eight-year-old girl
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.640]  with ovarian cancer and all the other young children who are being harmed and victimized
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:48.200]  by all these poisons and the vaccines and the gmo's what all ties into what we're talking about
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.920]  today and specifically the french study on gmo's you know with the rats with the massive tumors
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:58.920]  they had to drag along on the floor that were just almost bigger than their body um specifically
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:04.600]  that study found that the gmo's target women in in mammary glands and everything like that causing
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:10.520]  massive tumors so i would say that's most likely linked up and then you also have a study out today
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:17.000]  that shows lower income and lower education class of people who typically eat more gmo's and
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.080]  processed foods and stuff like that they're dying faster than their parents had died and you know
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.720]  the the age gap is ridiculous they're dying five years earlier every couple years now
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:32.600]  and it's all linked back to these studies that are ongoing and which if we had more we would
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:39.240]  conclusively know 100 million percent we already do but i mean the world would be in riots if we
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:43.960]  had these studies coming out in in the capacity they should but monsanto's censoring it over
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:48.280]  and over again making it almost impossible that's why it's from france that one of the major one
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:53.320]  is from france well yeah and never do that in the u.s. all the studies that i've seen that try to
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:59.880]  defend gmo's are all funded by monsanto scientists it's it's it just looks like straight paola here
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.600]  we'll pay you some money you find that these foods are safe and then we'll give you more work
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:10.600]  and that's and then scientists line up to do that and they are betraying humanity as a result and
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:17.400]  and you in particular anthony have called them that traders to humanity yes i have and we declared
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.120]  monsanto the worst company pretty much every year i've had my website done massive press releases
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:27.000]  about i've been threatened with my life i've had people send me pictures of my car in my house and
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.720]  tell me they're going to kill me but outside of that you look at the french media versus the united
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:37.960]  states media and you look at the difference uh roiders just like ten minutes after it came out
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.880]  said oh skeptic uh skeptics draw concerns over gmo study and here's the quote this guy says this
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:49.400]  funny guy if the effects are as big as purported and if the work really is relevant to humans
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.120]  like rats aren't you know really relevant to humans why aren't the north americans dropping
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:59.720]  like flies gm has been in the food chain for over a decade over there and the longevity continues to
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.320]  increase but that's a lie yeah people are dropping like flies i mean cancer rates are skyrocketing
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:10.040]  through the roof because these rates are off the charts but i mean probably everybody listening
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.000]  knows someone with cancer or they themselves have cancer i mean it it is through the roof below the
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.800]  age of 25 as well yeah exactly yeah i mean like like this eight-year-old girl with ovarian cancer
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:25.400]  you didn't you didn't hear about that uh a generation ago and you also don't hear about the fact that
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:31.160]  okay maybe they live a few years longer but what kind of quality of life are they receiving people
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:35.560]  can get chemo and essentially kill themselves through the chemotherapy which will sometimes in
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:40.440]  turn kill the cancer um but what kind of life are you living you know it says also one of these
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:45.320]  articles it said it from the 90s back when i was looking at researching it was saying there's a
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:50.200]  mysterious reason for the the massive deaths in children with cancer everything like that
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:55.400]  and then one article of rebuttal was saying from some some type of skeptic website oh well
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.840]  they're actually living longer they're just having a decreased quality of life and they're
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.280]  paralyzed and they have no hair and they and they can't talk and stuff like that
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.560]  that doesn't really necessarily correlate with an enhanced health system or anything like that
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:13.640]  they're just essentially dead but moving as zombies i think is the correct term for that
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.480]  for that unfortunate though too it's it's sad really it's really upsetting that's why i feel
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.320]  passionate to be here as well and talk about this because we can't actually use nothing about it
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:26.680]  zombie apocalypse is on it's it is upon us anthony i hope you have your flamethrower ready
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.480]  because the cdc says is coming that's i was just going to mention that yeah the cdc says the zombie
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:37.400]  apocalypse is uh could be upon us and oh and the cdc provides the solution i love how their little
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:43.000]  zombie comic book nobody has a firearm and the military is training for zombies too yeah that's
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.640]  that's absolutely true now getting back to these scientists in these gmo studies these scientists
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:53.320]  i've written that they are the most despicable humanoids to have ever walked the surface of
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:58.920]  this planet and i've been threatened too but the the the hilarious thing about this is that these
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.840]  scientists they can't stand being criticized by people who actually quote other studies
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.640]  by people who actually question you know we are the skeptics anthony people like you and i
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:15.560]  we are the real skeptics because we ask questions about science we don't just totally fall for their
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:20.280]  junk corporate science or science yeah that's exactly right the best way to say it like you
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.840]  just said it's corporate science yeah yeah it's it's junk science it's fraud science but you
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:30.520]  managed to anger one of these scientists so much to such an incredible degree that he wrote you
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:36.040]  a a raging email let's get into that right now tell us what's in the email absolutely so i had
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.920]  written this article basically explaining that these gm scientists who are manipulating nature
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:45.480]  and humanity itself altering our very genetic code and threatening future generations are
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:50.760]  essentially traitors to humanity and i think we said it best anti-human and some of the commenters
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:56.120]  got a little bit more detailed than i did as well and this guy got so upset that he went
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:01.080]  ahead and sent me an email and i independently verified it to be who this guy says he is and
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.160]  i've talked to you behind the scenes about that yeah but here's this email and i've taken out the
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.640]  uh expletive words the curse words that's littered all caps a lot of these words you
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:16.280]  might see it on the screen here it is i am no traitor against humanity if this expletive
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:22.680]  causes infertility awesome with three exclamation points awesome it's awesome it causes infertility
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:28.600]  the world is overpopulated and people need to stop having children this is one of the earth's largest
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:33.960]  problems if the earth wasn't overpopulated things like growth hormones wouldn't exist
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.480]  the reason they do is that the earth cannot produce enough food on its own to feed us all
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:46.520]  this is why gmo is actually saving the planet and then you can see how angry he is when he says so
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:53.160]  expletive you and you're expletive you can imagine what that means i am doing man doing humanity is
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:59.240]  all caps a expletive favor i was showing the email on screen for those of you watching on
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:06.120]  prisonplan.tv i am doing humanity a blank favor that is a favor yes all caps as well
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.640]  and you have confirmed that this is from the scientific uh let's just say i'm not going to
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:17.560]  give the name but uh a an entity very well known in the scientific community and i've independently
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.680]  confirmed that uh as well it's one of the top three we'll just say that all right it's it's it's
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:28.440]  someone that was so upset that they didn't take the necessary steps to protect themselves that they
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:32.520]  may have known about they were just so enraged you can tell from this email this guy's talking from
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:38.440]  pure hatred and he says things like if the world wasn't so overpopulated things like growth hormones
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:43.640]  wouldn't exist these things don't even make any sense yeah that's that's a large he loves the fact
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:51.080]  that it causes infertility okay so so this is the shift at first the gmo scientists said gmo's are
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:56.120]  no different than anything else they're the same and that's that's how they got regulated or let's
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:02.520]  say really not regulated as being the same and then the gmo scientists the the corporate sellouts
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:08.760]  said oh gmo's are different which is why we're patenting them but they're safe and how do we
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:14.520]  know they're safe because we tested them for a whole 90 days well now when really pushed to the wall
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:20.840]  when really pressed when really angered on this issue this guy comes out and admits we know gmo's
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:26.520]  cause infertility we know they're going to decrease human population and we want that that's the real
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.520]  story well they're only saying two different things in the public perception behind the scenes
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:35.080]  they all know it's actually killing you in fact we have the gm wheat study that shows that i mean
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.720]  we know that it's killing you we know that for a fact and they know that for a fact as you can see
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:45.080]  this is a senior scientist saying this and they don't care they love it because it's a trickle
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:49.880]  down system essentially they want to be like the elite they think that we're all peasants and they're
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:54.840]  the lords and that if we die that's awesome because they don't want they don't they don't have to die
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:59.240]  you know some of them their families might be eating this stuff likely not i'm sure they eat 100
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.720]  percent organic and laugh when it says that at least do it all all organic that's that's been
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:08.600]  that's been documented here and stories here and they have seed vaults down in the Antarctic and
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.800]  they they stash organic seeds because they know that contamination is the biggest issue right now
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:19.000]  alfalfa especially the gm alfalfa gets picked up in the wind and goes to organic farms and then
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.840]  when they test it to sell to other countries the other countries say no we don't want that so they
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:27.800]  just try and sell it in the us instead so it's contaminating the entire food chain and they
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:33.240]  notice so they're stockpiling for themselves as the peasants run around and eat the gm trash by
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:38.920]  the way we're going to do something interesting here we want callers who love monsanto to call in
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:48.440]  at 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 if you love gmos you love monsanto and you love poisoning

[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:22.680]  scientists that literally want to kill us all as one of them admits in an email that we just
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.080]  showed you we'll get back to that and anthony gucciardi is our guest this hour continuing to
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:34.360]  join us with some analysis of the gmo scourge that threatens all life on our planet check this out
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.560]  france orders a probe after that rat study came out showing the massive tumors in rats fed genetically
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:48.680]  modified corn france may in fact ban the the importation of gm corn it's already illegal to
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:54.120]  grow it there on info wars dot com right now monsanto launches damage control over the gmo
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:59.960]  cancer study this is an article by paul joseph watson you can check that out and i wrote an
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:05.160]  article that was published last night it's up on info wars dot com as well from zyclon b to gm
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:13.240]  corn how gmo's transformed food into a globalist weapon and in that story i talk about you know
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:19.080]  g the from a from a psychopathic globalist point of view the downside of zyclon b is you have to
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:23.880]  round people up a gunpoint and stuff them into the gas chambers wouldn't it be easier if you
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:30.520]  could just convince people to eat their own poison and that's gmo how wonderful so anthony
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:36.440]  gucciardi what do you think about all this coming out now it seems like we those of us who protect
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:42.280]  life on our planet we're winning and the scientists are getting outraged that they're losing the
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.480]  debate they're probably gonna lose proposition 37 they're gonna lose because this is all being
[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:51.720]  exposed what do you think anthony i think you just hit the nail on the head when you mentioned the
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:58.040]  fact that it's really a soft kill this is a new paradigm of warfare essentially instead of going
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:02.200]  out and rounding up people like hitler did and essentially killing them and whatever matters
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:08.280]  through guns or anything like that we're actually willingly paying corporations to funnel us
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:14.120]  genetically modified garbage that we then eat and kills us and not only us but our future generations
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:19.000]  and as you of course know women only have a certain number of eggs so essentially it's damaging
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.560]  every single potential offspring of theirs and that's why it's key to look at this
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:28.520]  article out today also about how low income families are dying off like crazy and have a
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:35.160]  super high incident of disease because they eat processed crap and if you ever go to use an unfortunate
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:39.880]  word some type of ghetto or anything like that all the stores they don't they can't even have
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.200]  any or anything organic they can go to a farmer's market and some do but i mean when you're living
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:49.640]  on food stamps a bag of doritos for 10 cents you can get 10 bags of doritos and have that for dinner
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.640]  and as gross as that sounds to many of us that's what a lot of people do and it's unfortunate
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:58.600]  and that's why they're seeing their lifespan drop that's why their genetics are being ruined
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:03.000]  that's why they're not even able able to have kids because we know actually that round up causes
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.600]  infertility that's years old we've known about this for a long time well yeah the FDA and usda do
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.480]  nothing france does because there's some people that actually care about stuff over there in germany
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:19.800]  and poland but over here i mean it's just zombie land no one even cares they just love the gmo's
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:28.360]  and the no to prop 37 getting funded by monsanto and everything it's so obvious it's so blatant
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:33.080]  yeah it really is blatant it's in your face and i like how you point out that this is really a
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:42.440]  a a dietary attack on poor people i mean that this this will harm poor people more disproportionately
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.840]  larger numbers of poor people than wealthy people who tend to eat gmo's and of course we know the
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:54.920]  global elite avoid gmo's completely they they they eat all organic they have raw milk served to them
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:28:02.200]  even as the the peons are arrested for selling raw milk or sometimes even transporting raw milk
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:07.800]  across state lines so yeah yeah the elite know don't touch this stuff this is the poisonous food
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:14.440]  for the masses and those masses are dropping like flies literally i mean look look at the
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:18.840]  cancer rates in this country i mean we're talking hundreds of thousands of people a year dead from
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:22.680]  cancer alone that's that doesn't cover heart disease and all the other causes of death
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:27.640]  yeah and how about some of those mysterious deaths which a lot of is now being found to be
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:33.960]  essentially toxic overload but also they want the peons to basically eat the food and die and not
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.280]  help children that's why they're now offering implantable chips to make you infertile as well
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:42.120]  that's new news you're talking about the uh morning after pill they give the garter so shot
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:47.560]  without parental consent right have it all down it's a total chemical assault is what it is
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:52.520]  yes it is i mean it's a genetic assault yeah and that's that's the biggest thing you're talking
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:59.000]  about the serpent or like that if you attack the genetic code of humans you're essentially touching
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.360]  the core of humanity it is anti-human every sense because you're destroying your you're
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:09.640]  unlocking the door for the Pandora's box yeah no kidding this is a new kind of warfare folks this is
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:16.520]  warfare on your seed this is not guns and and chemical weapons this is destroying your humanity

[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:52.680]  are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:57.080]  sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:01.720]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly i'm not sure what the food
[01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:05.720]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:09.960]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:15.480]  almost every culture even today japanese eat miso africans eat fermented porges koreans eat
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:20.280]  kamichi and in india fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news

[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:33.960]  them yourself for more information check out fermentation factor dot com that's fermentation

[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:58.440]  to www.fermentationfactor.com that's www all right we are going to be taking calls from people who
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:04.600]  say that they love gmo's they love monsanto they think gmo's are the greatest thing in the world
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:08.920]  now something interesting happened during the break uh as we went to break i looked at the
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:14.760]  phone board and it was stacked full of callers and then during the break the producer asked me
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:21.400]  said so you want people who are pro monsanto to call in is that right and i said yes yes that's
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:27.960]  what we want pro monsanto people and then i come back in and the phone board is empty which i guess
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:33.320]  and now i it looks like maybe some lines are ringing but we may have trouble finding people
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:38.680]  who are actually in support of monsanto if that's the case then i guess anthony we're not going to
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:43.640]  get threatened with being killed here on the air which is the you know that i mean that's what i
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.640]  expect to happen people calling in and saying we're going to kill you we know where you live
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:54.120]  that's what they do to us these these scientists are really well thugs ultimately your comments
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:34:00.360]  that happen what do you think well i think i've been threatened plenty i kind of miss it sometimes
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:04.360]  it makes it reassures me that i'm doing the right thing but i think hey any callers want to
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:09.960]  want to call in and uh maybe tell us why people why they think people love monsanto why is it
[01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:14.520]  still going on that might still work too but i i think i want to ask i know some out there are
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:18.040]  listening probably the scientists that emailed me too since it sounds like he essentially
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:24.600]  follows everything i do um but i want to read them a quote about this gm wheat and i want to i
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.960]  really want to know how anyone could think that this is a good thing okay wait a minute we anthony
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:35.000]  we have somebody on the phone board here who who says they're pro monsanto do you want to let's let's
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.120]  talk to them let's talk to them all right let's hear what they have to say uh feed man from pennsylvania
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:46.440]  says you're pro monsanto hello feed man welcome to the show what's uh you are you really pro monsanto
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:52.280]  are you joking oh well i'm pro everything oh i know you know gotta play with the winning team right
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:58.600]  as they always say and right now as i speak i'm taking a whole load of gmo corn to some
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:06.920]  unsuspecting farmers come on okay all right a lot of a lot of humor and comedy uh so i don't
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.600]  know hey you know i don't this way i'm not trying to interrupt i mean i understand what's
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:14.840]  feeling go so for months it's i can't hear the caller no no hold on anthony he is talking go
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:20.680]  ahead feed man go ahead uh yeah i don't i don't necessarily agree with monsanto but i like everybody
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:25.240]  even if you are a worthless walk of life i got your back but you know the second you cross my
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:31.960]  country you better watch out all right good thank you for the call that's uh a bit of a
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:36.280]  comedian calling in this is kind of as i suspected we're not going to get people actually calling
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:42.360]  in who can defend monsanto with anything rational so but let's keep trying the phone board is empty
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:47.960]  i this has never happened in the history of info wars because of course we called for people who
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:53.080]  support monsanto and all we can get is a guy honking his horn um anthony well hey he made a
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:58.600]  good point uh even the worthless monsanto zombies that want to kill everyone they still have a spirit
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.880]  but hopefully uh they'll come to their senses someday well yeah i was gonna i mean he said
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:10.360]  he's pro everyone though i mean does that mean what he's pro Stalin he's pro uh hitler i mean i
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:13.960]  don't i don't want to second guess the guy he's obviously having a fun time there but how can
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:18.840]  you be pro everything you can't be pro everything you have to have discernment yeah you do exactly
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:22.520]  and you can't let these people stomp all over you or you're just gonna eventually come to the
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:26.360]  point where you're groveling at them and that's not something that i personally want to do all
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:31.720]  right so let's let's do this let's change the rules since we can't find an actual person
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:36.680]  who supports monsanto all right so here you go callers and here we go one eight hundred two
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:42.840]  five nine nine two three one if you're against monsanto if you're against gmo's we'll take your
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:49.080]  calls now and let's see how fast we can get calls against monsanto's corruption versus
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:54.360]  four monsanto's corruption yes that's not significant in showing there's really not a lot
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:37:00.040]  of actual real people that like monsanto there's apparently none and when we have these comments
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:06.440]  on our websites five seconds after we post them six paragraphs long saying that gmo's seeds are
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:11.160]  great and we're stupid idiots that don't know how to read a study well it seems that they might have
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:16.360]  some type of financial interest in what they're doing or the people that go on social networking
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:21.080]  websites and you know blah blah blah all day long about how great monsanto is do you think they're
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:25.080]  real or do you think they're actually have some type of motivation oh they're paid and you know
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:29.800]  that i mean we yeah obviously they're paid they're paid trolls well look the board is filling up
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:35.800]  let's go to kenny in ohio uh but it says maybe pro monsanto so let's find out kenny in ohio
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:42.040]  you're on the air are you pro monsanto or are you against monsanto good reason one good reason
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:51.080]  to be pro monsanto all right the comedian is back thank you for adding humor to our broadcast so
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:56.760]  now we can confirm that he is indeed anti-monsanto so the one potential caller we had that was maybe
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:01.880]  pro monsanto because he said he liked people in general it turns out he hates monsanto too
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.840]  this is great let's go to shawn in tennessee shawn you're on the air are you pro monsanto
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:13.000]  are you against monsanto or are you honking a horn well let's put it this way judging from
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.600]  what i noticed happened with my mother uh being diagnosed with breast cancer now thankfully she
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:23.480]  got over it with all this new modern scientific medicine i don't really like it all that much
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:28.760]  i think it makes things worse but uh no i don't really care for monsanto they're killing people
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:34.920]  even those of my family and uh i'm really tired of their crap yeah are you are you teaching your
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:40.280]  family about avoiding gmo i've tried to approach them on different in different ways on many different
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:45.720]  levels my mom seems so confident and assured that she has this thing going hurt some kind of special
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:52.120]  diet with not being on gluten and all that yeah um i guess it seems reliable i don't i don't know if
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:58.440]  i can necessarily disprove it but uh you know she seems to be pretty confident in that uh as it's
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:03.640]  been lately but are you are you seeing it's just basically eliminating all gluten or whatever since
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:07.800]  i guess to what under from what i understand that's what her doctor's telling her that she
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:11.800]  has to go without that well that's that's a good thing to eliminate gluten but you got to watch
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:17.000]  out because corn is a gluten-free food and a lot of the gluten-free products are made with corn and
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.280]  if you don't buy organic then they they can be genetically modified corn uh anthony your thoughts
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:27.160]  on that point yeah i hear i hear callers every radio show i go on calling and say basically that
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:32.440]  they had a relative or even an animal in some cases farm owners call in we had a relative or a
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:36.920]  cattle or whatever eating this gmo corn or whatever it is and they just basically got cancer or dropped
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:41.800]  dead you'll notice the caller uh for the caller also though that that french study specifically
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.840]  mentions that the women were getting tumors a lot more quickly all right it targets the women
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.280]  absolutely it's unfortunate gluten free doesn't mean it's healthy always buy organic gmo free 100
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:56.360]  percent it can still be gmo if it's gluten a lot of people on that gluten craze you know yeah
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:01.080]  definitely okay let's go to some some other callers this is this is always fun we've got frank in
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:07.880]  nebraska who says the description says pro gmo frank is it true are you in support of monsanto
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:14.840]  and gmo's tell us please well i tell you what i think gmo food should be served at every builder
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:23.960]  burg meeting the whole u m wall street all you know and and and all the major financial centers
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:33.000]  and uh yeah so i mean it's it's it's like you know if if uh if messier's the ross child rack
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.760]  a feller and select select men and the rest of the crowd think it's so damn good but god they
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:43.800]  should be the first to eat it don't you all right frank wins the more cowbell award right here at
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:50.280]  the alex joe studios more cowbell for you frank good answer and uh literally we are trying to
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:57.000]  take calls from people who are in favor of monsanto and we can't find one person but thank you frank
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:04.120]  that was uh very uh very a very good uh suggestion and maybe we should take that anthony uh your
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.680]  thoughts on the globalists and their diets and why they're avoiding gmo well i think if they think
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:13.640]  gmo is the same as regular high quality organic food then they should really be eating gmo's all
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:18.360]  day long and i would challenge anyone that's pro gmo to literally eat a hundred percent diet of gmo
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:22.200]  foods for a year and if you're still alive then you call into the show and be the first caller
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:30.600]  to actually support monsanto maybe we should have a reward somebody wanted dead or alive yeah they
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.160]  call and they can't speak english anymore you know we'll uh we'll talk to them okay all right chuck
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:41.720]  in new hampshire chuck is apparently against monsanto is that true chuck are you are you
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:49.080]  not in favor of evil contaminated food that that may cause cancer tumors what's the deal chuck hey
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:54.200]  mike how are you i'm very much against monsanto and genetically modified foods the reason i called
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:59.080]  in i wanted to comment i met up with some libertarians uh two days ago we actually
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:04.360]  marched on the fed in boston but a number of these libertarians were in favor of genetically
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.720]  modified foods just because uh there's an whole issue of being libertarian not wanting to infringe
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:14.760]  on a company's right to promote these foods so i really think uh what the work you're doing is
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:20.040]  important trying to reach out and teach people why these foods are harmful and why they should be
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:26.120]  labeled in fact yes good point well libertarians should know that in a free market you have to
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:32.120]  have good information in order to make an informed choice so libertarians i would hope i mean i count
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:37.080]  myself as a libertarian leaning type of person but we got to know what's in the food to make the
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:42.520]  decision in a free market right what what do you think chuck no absolutely and i've read that one
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:46.920]  piece that you did about being able to make an informed choice in a free market you absolutely
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:54.040]  have to know what it is you're purchasing what you're exchanging for yeah right a lot of people
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:59.560]  are just misinformed there's a lot of misinformation about gmo's out there there's a lot of propaganda
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:04.120]  so i think the work that you're doing is extremely important so thank you well thank you chuck calling
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:12.200]  from the state named after hemp new hemp shire new hemp shire uh anthony the next call goes to you
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:17.080]  all right chris from kentucky chris welcome to the show do you have a question for anthony gucciardi
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:23.800]  yes i i formerly used to be for this until i woke up for somebody who educated on me uh i work part
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:28.120]  time in a restaurant and you will talk about the labels everything is modified that everything it's
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:35.000]  the genetically modified oils everything that's in there this is not food these days of you know i
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.840]  don't eat the food at the restaurant but with the economy i got work part time at this job
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:44.120]  but the reality of it is avoid it going to restaurants and ask questions if you can find
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:49.800]  some place they can locally support the farmers to have a restaurant that's where i go stay away
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:54.600]  from these chains very very good point restaurant food anthony your comments on restaurant food and
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.320]  gmo that's absolutely key and the same goes for supermarket food if you if you're going to a
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:05.080]  restaurant especially a low class not low class but a lower income bracket restaurant like mcdonald's
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:09.240]  or something like that and that's why we're seeing the study with people who are financially
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.400]  struggling dying quicker because they go to months they go to mcdonald's someone said
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:19.000]  monsanto they go to mcdonald's i'm saying buddy and they purchase a dollar burger or they go to
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.560]  supermarket and purchase a dollar chip bag or something like that chances are it is gmo almost
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:27.960]  a hundred percent of the time so avoid that absolutely what kind of bag did you just say
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:34.440]  chip bag you know oh it's a snack snack chip bag okay yeah i thought you violated f tc there for
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:41.880]  a moment okay let's go to leah no worries no worries it's all live radio leah in nevada are you pro
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:47.320]  monsanto are you against gmo's and our food being secretly added to our foods what's what's your take
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:54.680]  leah i'm definitely against gmo's uh in our food and there's two points i want to raise here um
[01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:01.320]  you know back in the day if you get a product that's poison why don't we have goals and cross
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:08.680]  bones on the label of these gmo foods i like that other thing is uh with all the smoking guns we
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:16.280]  have against uh monsanto and gmo's why hasn't there been a class action lawsuit in the united
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:21.640]  states because they're obviously killing people they're giving people cancer um and also you
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:26.840]  know the fertility problems why i mean to my knowledge there hasn't been a class action lawsuit
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.080]  can you uh that's a really good point and it would have to happen anthony on the scale of
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:36.280]  something like big tobacco wouldn't it well there have been lawsuits but i mean not a not a big
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:41.160]  nationwide class action type of deal oh right of course right uh it would have to it would have to
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:45.000]  be massive it'd have to have millions of dollars worth of funding we've looked into it uh we've
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.080]  actually discussed with a few people about what it would take and it would take it would take at
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.680]  least two million dollars just to even get the lawyer fees and everything out of the way to get
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:56.600]  started then you'd have to find people that were damaged from age and orange everything like that
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:01.160]  as far back as we're talking like the you know forties we can go back as far as then and start
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:05.160]  getting people that were damaged by monsanto related creations like age and orange and stuff
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.880]  like that which they did of course make and kill over 500 000 people they're not a corporation that
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:14.680]  cares about you and we would have to go and go through that process it would be super complicated
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:20.440]  i think the best way would just be to label the amount of existence yeah um hence prop 37 that's
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:24.840]  why this is the ultimate weapon uh for protecting our our health and safety and the food supply
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:30.680]  let's take another call anthony we've got mac in new hampshire with us uh mac are you are you in
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:37.560]  favor of gmo's or are you against them i'm against gmo's but uh think of it this way why does america
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:43.800]  eat them why doesn't our government ever come out and tell us well the scientists tell us that
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:48.120]  they they'd like the infertility they'd love decreasing the population that's what they say
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:55.720]  that doesn't get out onto your media does it no i mean the regular media right right now you guys
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:01.080]  always talked about hitler right you're talking about hitler he didn't kill all those people it's
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:08.280]  done by the same people that are doing it now what the rott child the legoya bitches uh i g
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:14.040]  farb and in the pharma industry right yeah but hey you guys should learn about hitley he didn't kill
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:20.120]  people that was that was done by the warburg the hamburg the same people it's the rich the
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:26.360]  ultra elite that are killing us you know you should never blame hilly he didn't do any of that stuff
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:32.520]  it's all done by the by the elite well yeah i mean the globalist madmen they always have henchmen
[01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:37.640]  to carry out you know thugs to carry out their orders i mean look at the tsa you know uh
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:42.360]  napolitano's not reaching down your pants not yet anyway but she's got a bunch of thugs out there
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:48.520]  at the airports who will gladly do it for them um anthony your thoughts on top down control of
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:52.760]  tyranny both of the college right obviously hitler was essentially a figurehead but it doesn't mean
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:56.680]  he's a good person at all i would definitely not say that no he wasn't saying that either he's just
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:01.400]  saying that no i just want to be clear you don't support him at all but what i was saying that
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:06.200]  should be a given you know welcome to show we don't support hitler we don't support when it gets to
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:09.560]  that point you know when we have to say we don't support it or something's wrong but anyway right
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:14.120]  um i was going to say basically i don't know if the caller is aware but there was a recent news piece
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.240]  i believe about two days ago that explained the german citizens a lot of the german military
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:23.800]  citizens actually got off without even orders they were they're going ahead and killing people killing
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.040]  babies killing women killing children this reminds me of this scientist once again if you missed the
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:32.040]  email i'm gonna read one portion of it oh yeah but no but hold on anthony you're right that that did
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:37.240]  just come out the it was interviews with german soldiers who loved the act of killing women and
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:43.000]  children they loved it they they lived for it yeah they physically were driven by it and even when
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.880]  they weren't ordered to kill they would just kill anyway which shows that it's a trickle down effect
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:52.440]  to the point where they think they're in power too over these four-year-olds and they get this
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:59.400]  disgusting power driven lust of killing these little babies literally little babies no it was
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.880]  one of the german pilots that would drop bombs on civilian populations i remember in this article
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:09.480]  he said it gave him a tingly feeling so i i wonder if these gmo scientists if they get a
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:15.240]  tingly feeling when they see you know low-income people shopping for corn chips in the store do
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:20.360]  they give them a tingly feeling to know they're they're soft killing those poor citizens well
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:24.680]  their leaders do at the top the elite certainly get that tingly feeling comes more i think of a
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:30.840]  evil feeling you know a lust of power but the scientists in this email like we said we verified
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:36.200]  it before you may have heard already but he said i am no traitor against humanity if this curse word
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.160]  causes infertility referring to gmo's awesome the world is overpopulated and people need to stop
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:45.240]  having children so obviously he's getting off on it just like the german soldiers i think
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:50.360]  we're getting off on it when they have no real power they're just killing babies and what's this
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.160]  guy killing low income or killing the world really everyone even rich people eat this stuff like mad
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:50:00.680]  scientist the world he's a mad scientist and he's he's probably making 500 grand to kill people
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:04.680]  right right because it's always it's always a lot of money and causing death it seems let's go to

[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:56.440]  home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kiefer it seems there's
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:51:01.000]  a war on life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly i'm not sure
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.360]  what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:08.360]  beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:13.480]  across the globe in almost every culture even today japanese eat miso africans eat fermented
[01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:18.600]  porges koreans eat kimchi and in india fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's

[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:09.400]  callers about gmo and how we're all being soft killed using food as a weapon but this individual
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:17.480]  was uh injected with experimental vaccines it says he now has 10 diseases uh is it tim is that your
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:24.200]  name yes sir okay tim you're back on there go ahead i was just pointing out that i heard alex
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:29.560]  the other day say he was 38 man and i remember thinking to myself well i'm 42 only four years
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:36.520]  older than him and i have 10 diseases 10 diseases now this low kill started for me 21 years ago
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:42.600]  um i've went on uh since then to get a degree in plant science and i was doing that around
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:48.360]  1999 and those monsanto people were sending salespeople to the university you know tells
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:53.560]  what a great thing this was really and i i remember questioning it thinking this can't be right
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:55:00.760]  so have you do you blame your uh diseases on the vaccines from the military or or diet or
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:06.600]  absolute absolutely from you know absolutely from the service from the depleted uranium
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:12.600]  and the multiple vaccinations and the live nerve agent absolutely the cause i had the same
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:18.600]  uh major rocky that comes on there a lot with alex uh from desert storm he's got teeth falling out i
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:24.840]  have the same type of symptom let's work i'm gonna have anthony read you a quote tim and uh anthony
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:29.240]  you had that quote ready yeah tim i want to bring this into reality for a minute people
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:34.440]  always think it's so funny to say that gmo's don't do anything vaccines are perfectly safe and the
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:39.240]  so-called skeptics really get off on it and love it i want to i want to really read this quote to
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:43.320]  you and i want you to respond tell me if this is the case because it's really upsetting to me this
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:48.360]  is happening if this is reality this color is reality and the people saying this garbage or not
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:53.880]  that this guy says well gmo's can't be bad he says if the effects are really as bad as they say
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:58.440]  and the work is really relevant to humans why are north americans dropping like flies and why
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:04.200]  aren't the disease rates rising tim can you tell me basically do you think that's true that that
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:10.680]  we're we're all fine everything's fine and in your in your scenario no absolutely not absolutely
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:16.680]  not no it's a slow kill and it's they're gonna die i'm gonna die i've known that since i got my
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:23.720]  degree in 99 i've known what's killing me now i know what's killing me see i my degree was actually
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:29.240]  specific in golf courses so i spent time on golf courses after i graduated and the insecticides
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:36.120]  were what hit me off oh man the the the recontact with insecticides i would start to vomit and
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:42.280]  drool and things like that so well you don't know it's it's it's not that that letter that person
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:48.120]  shouldn't be a accredited scientist this is the professor this is the skeptic professor
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:53.000]  saying that gmo's are perfectly safe on on reuters i'm reading it the effects are as big as
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.920]  purported and work is really often team is why aren't the american dropping the flies this is on
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:03.400]  reuters this is their main source to call the article skepticism grows over monsanto gmo corn
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:08.200]  study so this is this this guy that's completely out of touch with the reality literally lying
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:11.640]  as people are calling in and we're seeing the article saying that people are starting to die
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:16.520]  quicker and quicker cancer rates are skyrocketing he's saying everything's fine if the gmo's were
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:23.240]  so bad why is everything so perfect all right tim i i i i feel compassion for you man i just

[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:49.240]  fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is

[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:20.040]  filling in for alex today and wow what a show we've been talking about secret poison in your food
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:24.840]  gmo and anthony gucciardi is going to stay with us for the next few minutes and then
[02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:31.720]  we'll be joined by ted anderson in about seven minutes and check this out this news has just
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:38.360]  breaking yahoo news says that cows well the the drought has been so bad in the midwest the corn
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:45.000]  is super expensive and in short supply so these farmers are feeding their cows this candy now
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:52.040]  anthony you you brought this to my attention last night and uh i was just shocked i could not believe
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:57.880]  they're the feeding their cows marshmallows and fruit loops and gummy bears is this for real i mean
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:02.600]  has this what is this what it's come down to now we're feeding cows candy this is reality
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:06.520]  and for the very same reasons that we would never eat it they're feeding at the cows it says here
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:10.840]  that they're feeding it to them because of the high sugar content and no real nutritional value
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:16.600]  so they actually want no nutritional value and high sugar content to make sure the cows get really
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:23.160]  really fat really huge and of course they're also going to get super sick and get cancer and die
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:27.480]  during the same time so have to make sure they get them fat as possible so they can kill them as
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:32.360]  quick as possible so they don't actually die on them well the cancer tumors add to the raw beef
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:37.960]  weight don't don't they i mean apparently so the carcass weight little the extra tumors it it you
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:42.600]  know it gives them a little more payback for the for raising the cow doesn't it i mean i'm joking
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:48.360]  but of course of course i would hope that a usda inspector would see a large tumor and say no to
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:52.920]  that carcass but i mean you never know everything's crazy these days well apparently it's okay to feed
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:59.320]  them quote cookies gummy worms chocolate fruit loops and candies instead of any grain or corn
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:04.760]  which is bad at the beginning but uh so now not only do they have an excessive amount of antibiotics
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.400]  which yesterday two days ago were admitted to be harming human health i mean everyone knows about
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:13.800]  it's been admitted a bunch of times but a big story said that uh artificial hormones such as
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:20.200]  monsanto's cloned rbgh which how they make that is they clone genetically modified material and
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:25.080]  string it together and inject it into the cow sounds really good yeah well i think we're gonna
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:31.560]  have a pandemic of diabetic cows now is what what's gonna happen and then i think the cdc is going
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:35.720]  to announce there's a there's a new pandemic of diabetic cows and well the drug companies are
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:41.560]  going to have bovine diabetes drugs approved by the usda and we're going to have veterinarians
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:46.440]  running around all the cow fields now treating cows and charging a hundred thousand dollars to uh
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:50.520]  to for each cow to treat them for diabetes and what do you think about that but watch them apply
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:54.600]  it to humans too just like this cancer drug they were researching right they this is hilarious
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:58.600]  this everyone needs to listen to this they were researching a cancer drug and found that it accidentally
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:05.640]  made men sterile so now they're reintroducing it as a birth control drug for men it never ends
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:13.000]  anthony it never ends man it's i can't even talk about it sometimes but so now that the now the
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.480]  cattle won't just have these antibiotics growth hormone gmo's from corn everything like that
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.880]  but here are just some of the ingredients that they're now going to be eating in this new medley
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:26.760]  of candy high fructose corn syrup which as alex always talks about on info wars dot com and on
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:32.520]  the radio show contains mercury admitted by the washington post if you just google that right msg
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:39.640]  g hydrogenated oils pesticides herbicides like monsanto's roundup insecticides artificial flavorings
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:43.800]  artificial coloring artificial sweeteners like aspartame so not only are you going to get the
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:47.560]  whole dose of gmo's but now you're going to get some mercury and some high fructose corn syrup
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:51.960]  in there as well and then of course assuming you're eating conventional meat you can avoid this by
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:57.480]  your organic or avoiding me altogether um you should eat organic everything but really i this
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:01.240]  is what these people are going to be eating now it's going to be even worse and the cows are
[02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:05.160]  going to get even sicker and it's going to be even more detrimental to human i i just don't get it
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:11.720]  man i i um what kind of farmer thinks well my cow is hungry let's find some gummy bears well i'll
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:17.320]  tell you i mean that's right here it's right here we're we're out of time man all right i want to

[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:52.200]  calls in the next segment and i welcome calls on just about any any subject that you'd like
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:59.080]  to chat about so now in this segment ted anerson of course founder of genesis he is joining us
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:04.440]  now and ted has an update about not only gold prices and gold trends but also of course the
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:09.480]  well maybe you could call it a pandemic of counterfeit gold it's been counterfeited
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:15.400]  and it's the tungsten counterfeits are popping up everywhere this is a huge scandal ted thanks
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.720]  for joining us it's great to have you on the show today well thanks for having me up mike
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:23.720]  and it's good to hear from you as well i can tell you let's start with the spots on gold and then
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:30.680]  we'll get into the counterfeiting right now gold is at 1763 40 silvers at 30 401 we've seen
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:39.480]  1768 and we've seen 34 34 on silver um what the counterfeiting issue i mean the problem is that
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:45.160]  tungsten has the same density and weight as gold in other words if you have the same size tungsten
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:51.720]  bar as you would a piece of gold they would look they look the same in as far as the size is
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:57.080]  concerned they would they would fit in that particular era but so you can put tungsten inside
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:03.160]  of a gold bar and not have to change the size of the gold gold bar in order to achieve the weight
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:07.800]  now so you have to be very careful this careful of this i mean one of the one of the main things
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:14.760]  is probably stay away from uh you know uh craigslist and ebay when buying gold just for this reason
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:18.440]  because once you buy it it's yours you're not going to you know end up with a if you end up
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:23.320]  with a tungsten bar you have no one to go back to so you just have to be careful with this particular
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:29.000]  type of market you're right it is showing up in new york city we've seen bars show up in in in
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:35.240]  london and also some other foreign markets markets as well um and it it's a big enough issue for
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:41.080]  people to be concerned uh if you think you mean do you think is this just malicious operators who
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:45.480]  are drilling out the bars and keeping the inner gold filling them back with tungsten and selling
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:51.560]  them off or is there some kind of a larger i don't know agenda to flood the the gold supply
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:58.920]  with tungsten and thereby drive down the price of gold well i mean there there is a a a leverage
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:04.280]  benefit i guess if you will if you have more bars of gold stored on hand like if you were a central
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:09.400]  bank and you wanted to lease gold into the marketplace to suppress the price of gold which
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:15.000]  is a practice that has been going on for years into central banks to have more gold to lease
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.720]  would bring down the cost of leasing gold and therefore more people more people in the futures
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:25.960]  market can sell short um i can tell you there's been some involvement with that not necessarily
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:30.360]  with the tungsten but for those of you would like to understand more about that gata covers it very
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:38.600]  well gata.org they've had lawsuits about the manipulations of gold prices um and uh and of
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:44.680]  course if you have more gold bars tungsten filled gold bars uh usually the gold never gets into the
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:50.680]  hand of the end user it's just a futures contract paper shuffling if you will so if you can increase
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:56.120]  the supply of gold by adding tungsten to the center of it uh that would have an effect on that
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:01.720]  how that play comes out and whether or not there's a a conspiracy by the central banks of this world
[02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:05.880]  we have yet that yet to prove of course they don't want to even admit to trying to manipulate the
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:11.720]  markets however uh their own memos and so on and so forth litigation uh shows that that is the case
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:17.800]  that's been going on and that's why we have gata and their litigation um the thing about it is mic
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:23.160]  is you just simply have to be careful uh tungsten is a very hard metal gold is very soft it's not
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:28.760]  hard to tell the difference color wise because tungsten is gray gold is gold uh for the individual
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:33.720]  if you're in question as to what you might have you can have it ultrasound uh to see what's in
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:37.320]  the center of that bar and you'll be able to detect the tungsten in addition to this if you
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:41.160]  feel that concerned about it you can actually take a drill and drill into it and because you're
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:46.840]  dealing with gold it can be smelted back into a bar again at any time and turn you know and use
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:51.400]  for trade uh you do lose a little bit of a premium because now that bar has a hole in it you have to
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:57.560]  smelt it off uh it you'll get about 95 percent of the spot price but main thing about it is is mic
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:02.200]  you just deal with a a very reputable deal or somebody you can trust well that's the main thing
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:06.360]  make sure you know where you're getting your gold of course ted anderson is the founder of mitis
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:13.480]  resources website mitisresources.com and that's where really i think most info wars listeners go
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:20.120]  to get their gold and silver and other precious metals coins and the the number of course is 800
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:29.160]  686 2237 800 686 2237 i'm a customer of mitis i actually made a purchase there about a year ago
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:34.200]  got got good service and uh really appreciate what your team is doing there ted uh what what are you
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:38.440]  hearing from college right now is there a lot of excitement about gold finally trending uh upward
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:43.320]  again or are people concerned what what's going on you got to realize this summer was fairly slow
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:47.640]  for gold so people backed away from it there was actually some fear and some people actually selling
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:51.960]  off their portfolios figuring that gold would be going down you know i tried to convince people
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.880]  it's like you know the the the the reasons for owning gold are still there we still have an
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:01.400]  economic meltdown going on in europe our debt in the united states is out of this world and we're
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:07.640]  consuming about 45 percent of gdp just to serve us interest on debt when you consider the uh the
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:13.160]  off budget debt as well as the on budget so what's going to happen interest rates go up i mean
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:18.200]  obviously it's going to create uh even larger burden on the people of the united states and you
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:23.640]  can see more printing going on uh in washington dc and diluting of the money just like we have
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:28.040]  been seeing in the past so there's a lot of good reasons to be getting into gold one of the reasons
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:32.840]  why alex and i were talking about what can we offer the people that are listening to the show
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:38.360]  that would actually educate them and get them up to speed and what's going on going on economically
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:45.080]  and what we came up with is the uh the american dream video his uh followed the follow the uh
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:51.320]  not the fall of the republic but the obama deception and also uh joe plumber's book dishonest
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:57.240]  money which is a very abbreviated version of the uh creature from jackall island but it really does
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:03.080]  delve into uh how money comes into existence why we continue to see the printing press run
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:08.520]  and why washington behaves the way that they do and and we we sell that with two silver dollars
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:13.160]  and we're delivering them delivering the whole package right now for seventy two dollars per
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:17.720]  package and that gets people a couple silver dollars of videos and and the books so yeah that's
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:22.440]  that's a great deal folks this is the lost leader that alex often describes and today it's seventy
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:27.960]  two dollars that that price will no doubt be higher in another week or so i mean you you have to you
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:33.080]  alter that price i remember you know it was sixty something dollars uh a couple weeks ago you changed
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:37.640]  that according to the market right yeah it has to go up because the price of silver is going up when
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:42.280]  i priced the silver dollars at sixty three dollars you gotta realize silver was at twenty six dollars
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:46.200]  at that time right right now we're looking at thirty four dollars silver what do you think is
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:51.240]  going to happen in the future we're in the fall we have lots of problems right now germany is expected
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:55.160]  to go into recession and they're the ones that have been bailing out grease well who's going to
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:59.880]  bail out germany the printing press is going to bail out germany and we're going to be on the hook
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:05.560]  because the fed is tied into the european union well plus we got qe unlimited now going on eighty
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:12.440]  five billion dollars a month for how many months that nobody knows right exactly and and ben Bernanke
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:17.880]  no longer has to bring it up anymore too he can he can he can increase quantitative using or decrease
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:21.960]  quantitative using it doesn't even have to talk about it there's not going to be a whole new announcement
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:29.480]  we have qe two on steroids qe three is here and uh as long as we have uh as long as we have uh
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:33.640]  you know the problems that we have they're going to they're going to go to the printing press
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:37.640]  and it's going to come right directly out of the value of our currency and that's why gold and silver
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:41.800]  goes up so all right well thanks for the update ted it's always great talking to you the phone

[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:54.520]  now commit suicide than are killed in car crashes as a miserable economy takes its toll this is the
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:18:00.760]  story from a daily daily mail from out of the uk suicide is the cause of more deaths than car
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:06.040]  crashes and of course you always have to wonder too what's the link to the psychiatric drugs
[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:11.560]  the antidepressants that have suicidal thoughts and violent thoughts as one of their side effects
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:16.040]  but uh clearly the economy has something to do with this as well we see crime on the rise

[02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:41.080]  interesting perspective but let's let's get to something even more interesting now let's take
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:47.400]  some calls do we dare uh i love taking calls because the callers are so well informed and
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:52.760]  also you never know what you're going to get so let's do that right now we've got lars in denmark
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:25:00.200]  on the line with us lars you're live on the air go ahead sir hi thank you thank you thank you adam
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:06.440]  i just want to make a quick comment before i have a question about the change in the ring
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:12.680]  the comment is that you know here in denmark of course um info wars is not as big as it is
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:20.520]  as it is in the states but i just started a new job a few weeks ago and out of four guys working
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:26.520]  there one of them was also a regular listener great that was quite awesome to find out that you
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:32.280]  know even in a small country like denmark with what five and a half million people uh there was
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:36.680]  sort of quite a few people who listened so well it was a global reach and it's getting bigger every
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:42.600]  single day do you have another question lars that's exactly right yeah i have a question about
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:50.120]  because we tried some change in the ring from the integrity yes and the family member had a problem
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:55.080]  after having a call that removed which we probably shouldn't have done but now it's out so we can't
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:00.520]  do anything about it but this change in ring actually helped i took some and i felt a lot of
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:07.800]  energy in my 70 year mother mother started started there skipping her new nats she felt a lot of
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:15.480]  energy too and then we used it all up and ordered another one and good caught in the customs department
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:20.600]  of course they wanted to check it you know you can make your own decisions here in denmark of course
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:28.360]  right so they they stopped it because of this uh glucose amine which is apparently allowed in
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:33.720]  europe uh you can't take it of course they add you know they admit it's it's good for it's good for
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:38.360]  you but it's really important from the states then you can't well lars the bottom line is that the
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:44.600]  european union especially is so strict on restricting your right to nutritional supplements
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:50.680]  it's it is a tragedy of of health and uh some some of the countries you can't even get vitamin c
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:54.280]  shipped into the country without it getting seized and then you have to pay big fines or
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:58.680]  or just you lose it it gets confiscated but thank you for your call lars and also i do want to
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:03.160]  mention for those who have their gallbladders removed remember doctors typically don't tell you
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:09.000]  that the gallbladder has a role in your digestion specifically if you eat dietary fats and you have
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.320]  your gallbladder removed then you're not going to be able to digest those fats as easily you need to
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:19.960]  supplement with some some enzymes that can help digest fats that's part of the role of the gallbladder
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:24.440]  hey you can't just take organs out of the body and not think something's going to happen right so
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:30.280]  so do your homework get informed if a doctor wants to remove something from your body like
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:35.640]  like your your gallbladder or or a kidney or something you know learn what that does
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:39.400]  huh kind of a good idea so uh thank you for your call though good information let's go to
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:45.800]  peter in washington peter you're on the air go ahead sir what's your comment or question um a few
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:54.840]  days ago or last week i think it was you had a report with the man from e foods on the food
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:28:03.960]  crisis and i just wanted to update it in 1966 western islands which was the publishing
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:09.320]  arm of the john birch society at that time published a book called ill fares the land
[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:18.120]  the famine planned for america by dan p van gorder now that's almost 50 years ago
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:26.280]  so and uh at that time it was started with the agricultural adjustment act of 1933
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:31.320]  they didn't get too far basically what they did was they falsely reported
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:38.120]  that we were having surpluses and they did that because the production was going up then
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:45.400]  but not on a but it was dropping on a per capita basis and they were importing more and more food
[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:51.080]  and then they they fiddled a little bit with the statistics so you're saying that this is
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:56.680]  this has been an ongoing agenda for decades then and the interesting thing is the agricultural
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:08.680]  department uh was run by henry wallis jr who was a communist and ran against truman in 1948
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:14.440]  claiming that the problem is not the communist but the communist issue now in the department
[02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:19.000]  of agriculture and we got to go to break but i appreciate your call that's a really good point
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.800]  sorry to cut you off there we got to take a hard break here but we'll be right back stay with us
[02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:28.200]  more calls and more information straight ahead on the alex jones show this is mike adams stay with
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:39.400]  us we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:41.400]  is
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:47.960]  erin fullen here as the food police shut down food co-ops the amish and small farmers
[02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:52.840]  americans are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy homecrafted
[02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:57.160]  sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kiefer it seems there's a war on
[02:29:57.160 --> 02:30:01.560]  life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly i'm not sure what the food
[02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:05.560]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history
[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:09.640]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:15.000]  almost every culture even today japanese eat miso africans eat fermented porges koreans eat
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:19.640]  kamichi and in india fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news
[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:23.720]  self-reliant americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods
[02:30:23.720 --> 02:30:28.040]  legally and privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:32.280]  can make them yourself for more information check out fermentation factor dot com that's

[02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:48.440]  drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on
[02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:53.720]  record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy
[02:30:53.720 --> 02:30:59.080]  alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock
[02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:03.560]  is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy
[02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:08.840]  to counter this is to freeze your food cost in today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:13.560]  from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise

[02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:04.680]  all right long segment here you are listening to the alex chone show
[02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:10.120]  this is mike adams the health ranger filling in for alex today let me share this with you
[02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:17.080]  before we continue with calls i promise to give you some information about how to protect yourself
[02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:25.560]  from msg monosodium glutamate now msg is an excitotoxin that's how dr rustle blalock describes it
[02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:29.080]  he's a neurosurgeon who's an expert in this area in fact he's been a guest on this show
[02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:34.440]  many times msg is found in all kinds of foods and they hide it using other ingredients such
[02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:43.720]  as yeast extract so remember that ingredient okay yeast extract that is that contains up to about 14
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:51.080]  percent free glutamate which is a taste enhancer a chemical taste enhancer now there's a new study
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:58.280]  and this study is fascinating in that it it offers a possible solution to protecting
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:04.680]  yourself from msg and i think uh let's see it's called the combined treatment with capsicum
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:09.640]  and resveratrol enhances neuro protection against glutamate induced toxicity in mouse
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:17.160]  cerebral cortical neurons uh in layman's terms what it means is that they tested glutamate toxicity
[02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:23.720]  on the neurons the brains of mice and they found that these two substances offer some protection
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:28.840]  this is good news and this is breaking right here on the alex jones show i'm not aware of anybody
[02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:36.200]  else who has covered this but it means that you can take resveratrol which has been called a
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:42.840]  miracle molecule by scientists and that resveratrol holds real promise for protecting you from the
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:49.400]  toxic effects of msg it's kind of a defensive shield now this hasn't been tested on humans
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:56.760]  to see if it reduces neurotoxicity of msg so some of this is just conjecture but it has real
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:00.920]  promise there and resveratrol has so many benefits for heart health and longevity
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:06.120]  that i would recommend resveratrol anyway and that of course resveratrol is the molecule that's
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:12.840]  often famously found in red wine it's in grapes especially organic grapes because this molecule
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:19.800]  resveratrol is produced by the grape plant in response to a fungal infection so you got to go
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:26.440]  for organic grapes you get high resveratrol and it may protect you from the toxic effects of msg
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:32.440]  and capsicin may also protect you although uh that one you know that's a that's a hot pepper
[02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:37.800]  so um that intuitively it would seem like that would make the problem worse but in fact the study
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:43.880]  showed it had a neuroprotective effect that's very interesting science now in addition to that i
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:48.360]  promise to share some thoughts with you on protection from radiation this is a big deal
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:54.520]  because of fukushima but not just that we've got the possible future radiation problems what if
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:36:01.960]  nuke power plants across the usa go into meltdown uh what if there's a a high altitude emp weapon
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:06.840]  detonated over america for example takes out the power grid and it wouldn't be long before some
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:12.760]  nuclear power facilities start to go into meltdown like they did in fukushima what are you going to
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:18.040]  do then well here are some foods that can help protect you from radiation and i really want
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:22.680]  to encourage you to eat these on a regular basis they're also really healthy for other reasons
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:31.560]  um miso is a traditional japanese food a soup base it offers protection from radiation probiotics
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:38.440]  are also very good clorella is a superfood a micro algae clorella iodine of course as you know is
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.160]  offers protection to the thyroid which is why the government even recommends potassium iodide
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:50.360]  pills for protection from radiation poisoning but you can find iodine in seaweed so if you can work
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:56.200]  some seaweed into your diet now me being a guy from the midwest i think that sounds crazy how am i
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:37:02.680]  going to work seaweed into my diet well sushi is the easiest way the nori cheats that that the sushi
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:08.040]  is rolled in they actually help protect you from radiation poisoning believe it or not and also
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:15.320]  there are internal clays so some clay that's actually used for detox you actually ingest the
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:22.920]  clay and clay absorbs a lot of toxic elements not just radiological but also chemical and can help
[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:28.360]  clean those out of your body but always when you ingest something like clay please do it under the
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:34.440]  supervision of a naturopathic physician don't just go go winging it on this stuff get some good
[02:37:34.440 --> 02:37:39.800]  information um you know hey read natural health websites and get get get informed so you know
[02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:46.360]  what you're doing but anyway those are the protections against radiation and msg now let's go to the
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:51.000]  calls and i hope we have a caller who's going to call about this new york city schools giving out
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:57.400]  mourning after pills to young students without telling their parents really hope we have a
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:03.480]  caller on that john from washington john you're on the air what's what's on your mind man well
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:10.360]  what's on my mind is monsanto gummy worms and hogs there you go sounds like a great buffet tell you
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:18.120]  that uh i'm a retired ornamental horticulturalist of 21 years and um and some of my renewal classes
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:27.400]  are continuing ongoing education um we took herbicide and pesticide courses and uh i know
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:34.360]  you'll be really surprised about this but they had these little um junior vps from monsanto
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:40.360]  that actually taught the class wow and the guy came up there and it was his practice he was well
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:46.360]  known for this and that at the beginning of every year with the new class he would take a bottle of
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:53.320]  roundup pop the cap on it pull the metal seal off to prove that it was you know hadn't been tampered
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:39:01.480]  with and pour it out one ounce shot glass full and throw it back and drink it and this was done to
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:09.880]  uh as an example to us as to how safe it was he taught us how safe it was no he's basically
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:18.120]  he couldn't be drinking roundup back then and as a result um years later at the age of 46
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:25.960]  i found out that i had atrazine malphion and a number of other um chemicals in my bone marrow
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:32.920]  and spent two years trying to get that flushed out and fixed up wow this is this was the misinformation
[02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:37.720]  and disinformation campaign that monsanto has been foisting on people for all this time well
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:41.560]  that's incredible that they infiltrated the education process i wonder what happened to that guy that
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:48.360]  was claiming to be chugging uh shot glasses of roundup any word today i would love to see him
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:56.200]  today he's probably dead i got yeah i got uh but but i had so many problems um uh approaching the
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:01.640]  time when i retired because uh and now i've got everything from skin problems problems with my
[02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:09.240]  nails i lost my right eye um and this was all from from from chemical poisoning um the second
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:13.000]  thing i want to talk about was that you i noticed that you mentioned that deal about feeding the
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:19.240]  the gummy worms to to the cattle and such but there there might be a slightly different perspective
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:25.480]  on that uh that you that you might consider and i have a friend that's in indiana uh spoke with
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:34.360]  him up gosh a couple weeks ago and he said that 70 percent of the corn crop has failed out midwest
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:39.160]  and then you know the the corn production area that's right and that the 30 percent that's left
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:46.120]  over is uh you got a government mandate they're using it to make ethanol well the cost of corn
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:53.480]  is so expensive now that using ethanol which was supposed to lower the cost of gas is actually
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:41:00.120]  making the cost of gas go up because they're using that 30 percent of the corn that they do have
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:05.880]  to make ethanol i wouldn't miss so so so we're putting our food in our gas tanks and then we're
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:13.480]  feeding our cows candy and then we're injecting little girls with birth control in school and
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:20.040]  we're all eating poison gmo's and this is all called normal wow yeah well what he told me was
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:26.680]  that the guys are going from uh indiana up into the northeast area where they have all the
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:32.760]  Oreo factories and the candy manufacturers and so forth i guess they're concentrated up there
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:38.040]  any rate he said that they don't it's not that they want to feed this crap to their to their
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:43.160]  cows and their pigs the fact is they don't have anything to feed to them yeah i get that going
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:49.160]  up there and getting tractor trailer truckloads of Oreo crumbs uh like you said gummy bears
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:56.520]  cereals uh floor sweepings the stuff they clean out of the equipment that they make these uh
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:02.520]  these products with and bringing that back to feed to the animals not necessarily to fatten
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:08.760]  them faster but just to keep them alive to start with so they don't lose their stock and and because
[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:14.520]  it's got so much corn syrup in it that he says that they're getting at least a small fraction
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:20.360]  of the nutrition out of the corn which i argued with them about right the point is well taken
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:24.040]  but wow well that's that's great information john thanks for sharing that with us thanks for your
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:29.080]  call i mean hey i guess in another month the ranchers and by the way i i feel for the ranchers
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:34.520]  we went through a bad situation here in central texas last summer with the the fires and the and
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:38.600]  the drought here and ranchers were in a tough situation but maybe the midwest they can take
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:42.760]  their cows trick or treating and just eat up all the candy that are given out by households
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:47.960]  but it might take a while to unwrap all those little gummy bear packages though wouldn't it
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:52.360]  it's just insane man it's insane we're feeding the cows this this this food with artificial
[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:57.480]  color in it this candy it's not you almost can't call it food but good points john i'm really glad
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:02.760]  you you shared all that with us let's go to another caller harry in pennsylvania harry you're on the
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:10.280]  air go ahead sir what's on your mind hi i'd like to know if canola oil is a g e type wow about food
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:16.120]  should we avoid it most canola oil is genetically engineered yes but not all and hence the need
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:21.000]  for labeling wouldn't you like to know the difference if you're at the store and you're buying canola
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:26.440]  oil wouldn't you like it to say either no gmo's or yes it contains gmo's so you can make a decision
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:31.480]  but yeah a lot of canola is genetically engineered and it's used throughout most salad dressings
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:37.640]  that you buy at the grocery store another form of of hidden of of food ingredients that you
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:41.960]  don't know what they are and of course canola oil used to be called rape seed oil before they
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:47.000]  change the name for marketing reasons what do you think about that well mike you're right in fact
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  i found out also that even if something says sugar you have to call and ask them if it is
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:02.520]  100 cane sugar or also contains uh beet sugar and if it contains beet sugar are the beats gmo
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:07.960]  that's right by it's saying sugar you are exactly right sir good point you're educated
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:12.920]  man i love it uh the gmo beats were planted for quite some time i don't think they're
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:17.960]  allowed to plant them this year we should check with jeffrey smith on that fact checking but
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:23.560]  they're definitely pushing for gmo sugar beats to be allowed again and they want everything to
[02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:29.400]  be gmo that's what they want everything everything gmo so thank you for your call very good points
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:35.960]  there harry let's go to dave in florida dave you're on the air go ahead sir hey mike thank you for
[02:44:35.960 --> 02:44:42.040]  all your great work on the healthy foods i got a question about synthetic vitamins and minerals
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:49.800]  yeah i'm purchasing the young jeffrey products and my sister also works in supplemental vitamins
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:56.520]  and she was telling me that some of the stuff has acetate palatate or isolate in it and could you
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:03.400]  tell us uh if that's since synthetic stuff is bad for you or if it's actually good for you and about
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:09.720]  hcl okay well in my view i always prefer to get nutrients from food and i i love food-based
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:13.400]  nutrition the young jeffrey product is a great supplement especially for those who have been
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:19.480]  nutritionally deficient for a long period of time and there is benefit to them but i personally i
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:25.080]  like to get food-based nutrients uh from superfoods and things like that one of the great benefits of
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:29.880]  young jeffrey by the way though is the minerals the mineral elements that are in it uh a lot of a
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:34.760]  lot of um elements that you normally aren't going to get the trace minerals from and i know some
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:40.520]  people who criticize that there are trace levels of of some light metals in there but the level is
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:46.760]  so trace look people you got to understand it's the dose that is either the benefit or the poison
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:53.080]  i mean i exposed the product uh last year a detox product that was a thousand parts per million
[02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:59.480]  of aluminum and it was dissolved in sulfuric acid and people were drinking that and taking that and
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:04.680]  i said that's insane that can't be safe but if you're getting you know if you're getting a small
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:08.520]  amount of aluminum in a natural matrix that's full of all the other elements that's actually
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:15.960]  perfectly safe and as i understand it those elements are from plants so um in in in my view
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:22.120]  i would prefer to get vitamins from plant and whole food forms and so there are lots of choices
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:27.080]  for that i don't know everything about young jeffrey products but i'm sure someone else here
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:32.200]  will be able to answer those questions in more detail does that does that help what yeah great
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:39.480]  answer um how about the hcl well depends on the source uh sometimes those the source for hcl can
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:44.920]  be from animals which which i wouldn't necessarily want want to take i'm not familiar with what
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:49.720]  source is being used in young jeffrey i i apologize i haven't gone you know line by line on that
[02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:55.320]  product to know exactly what's in it but you know the the results speak for themselves that's for
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:00.680]  sure i mean people here in the office get fantastic results on the product i'm not affiliated with
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:06.040]  the company and i don't you know i don't promote it or sell it so i'm sort of an independent point
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:09.800]  of view on that but you can't argue with the results a lot of people are getting benefits
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:17.400]  from it no question about that okay i was thinking of uh growing organic food on my property i'm a
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:23.320]  retired military member and i was just wondering what what do you what do you think about the
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:31.800]  government's um rules about uh home farming and stuff well i'm i'm i'm a little freaked out by
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:36.760]  some of their rules they're trying to criminalize farming and and home gardening and we've seen the
[02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:42.840]  attacks on on julie bass in oak park michigan for example um the woman in tulsa oklahoma
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:47.240]  whose garden was destroyed by the local authorities they don't want you to be able to grow your
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:53.080]  own food now and remember your first question was about really where should you get your nutrients
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:59.560]  ideally and i've always said this and i will continue to say this even if i promote a supplement
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:05.800]  you should always get your nutrients first choice from food that you grill yourself supplementation
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:11.400]  is always the backup plan it's always the next best choice but it's so much better to get it from
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:16.280]  supplementation than to try to just eat the standard diet which is nutrient depleted so remember
[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:22.680]  real food that you grow at home is always always always your number one choice of live nutrition
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:28.360]  supplementation is always just the second backup plan to bring you the things that you can't grow
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:32.600]  because of time or because of soils or climate or whatever whatever the case may be
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:37.560]  does that does that help answer your question very much so amen brother thank you very much
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:41.480]  thank you thank you for your questions really appreciate that all right let's go to pat in
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:48.600]  california pat you're on the air go ahead hi thanks for taking my call um i want to make two quick
[02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:54.680]  points um in regards to gmo i want people to remember uh if they remember the situation
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:49:01.880]  with the bee populations dying off they found out 10 years ago in france the farmers did test on
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:07.720]  certain pesticides and they realized that the bees were dying off when they were exposed to these
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:14.120]  pesticides well it's interesting because it was even in the new york times uh march of this year
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:19.320]  um i i asked people to look i was surprised it was in the new york times because they're so
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:24.680]  corporative but um it says two studies point to common pesticides as a culprit in declining
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:30.280]  bee colony yeah and i want to tie that to gmo's because it's the same thing you know how for years
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:35.720]  they always told us yeah pesticides are fine they're safe don't worry about it and you know and we
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:40.680]  know without bees our plants nothing will grow that's right i mean that's when you have to realize
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:45.880]  how devastating this is but the pesticide industry keeps pumping money into our politicians well
[02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:49.640]  you're right pat the common thread here is that we're always lied to by these so-called corporate
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:56.120]  scientists they lie about pesticides they lied about dbt they lied about uh big tobacco and by
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:00.760]  the way the really toxic stuff in the cigarettes is not the tobacco it's all the chemical additives
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:06.600]  that they put in there just smoking actual tobacco isn't nearly as bad for you as all the other things
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:11.080]  but they lied to us about all all that science over the years and you're right you're right to ask
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:16.200]  pat uh are they lying to us again about gmo we think they are are they lying to us about
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:22.040]  pesticides are they putting at risk the entire human race because as you hinted there if the
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:28.360]  pollinators are are destroyed then we're history about a third of all our food is pollinated by
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:33.720]  honeybees if they don't make it we don't make it it's a big deal um i appreciate your question pat
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:37.720]  very good question we're going to break we'll be right back after this so stay with us a few more
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:41.560]  calls straight ahead
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:48.840]  erin fullen here as the food police shut down food co-ops the amish and small farmers americans are
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:53.560]  losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but the healthy homecrafted sources for
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:58.120]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:51:02.280]  with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly i'm not sure what the food police are so
[02:51:02.280 --> 02:51:06.520]  afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with archaeological
[02:51:06.520 --> 02:51:10.760]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture
[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:16.200]  even today japanese eat miso africans eat fermented porges koreans eat kimchi and in india
[02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:20.840]  fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant americans can

[02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:56.840]  a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and
[02:52:56.840 --> 02:53:01.400]  government agencies for what they really are incompetent line crooks that are counting on
[02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:07.880]  your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high some have called this a conspiracy
[02:53:07.880 --> 02:53:13.080]  others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes
[02:53:13.080 --> 02:53:19.880]  my video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how i beat them and how
[02:53:19.880 --> 02:53:25.000]  you can beat them too watch the controversial video the thousands of other smart patriots have

[02:53:58.120 --> 02:54:03.640]  all right i love taking calls but our callers are so informed here the listeners to the alex
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:10.920]  shown show are just really the most informed listeners on all subjects you know the economy
[02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:16.040]  politics and and now health and gmo is more and more i'm i'm so happy that alex has been covering
[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:22.200]  that in the last couple years at an increased pace i remember i guess about four years ago or so
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:28.520]  alex wasn't really covering uh much that much in the realm of health but he's he's really covered
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:34.280]  more and more of it and aspartame and the genetic engineering of of how aspartame is is created
[02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:39.400]  it's exciting because as i've said on this show we got to support nutrition for patriots folks

[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:32.680]  from kentucky chris you're on the air on the elixir show go ahead sir all right thanks for having
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:40.120]  me on you bet um i was wondering if you might speak to how exactly the environmental movement
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:48.680]  namely the production of ethanol corn or the switchover from food corn to energy corn has
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:59.080]  basically proliferated the and accelerated the uh cause of the gmo food in ways of great question
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:06.760]  no i get it man a great question great question i am absolutely incensed at the environmental
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:13.720]  movement for not speaking out more against gmo uh the the environmental movement has been hijacked
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:20.600]  by globalists you know that they're not really pro environment what they're all about is is not
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:25.160]  really addressing the real threats to the environment because i'm an environmentalist
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:29.720]  in a legitimate way i don't want the environment to be polluted with genetic pollution through
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:35.560]  gmo's all right i don't want mercury in the environment from dentistry you know how many
[02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:41.880]  tons of mercury are are tossed down the drain at dental offices or even when people die and
[02:56:41.880 --> 02:56:47.160]  they're cremated how much mercury goes into the air because of their mercury fillings i mean that's
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:52.760]  those are real environmental issues the loss of soils the use of roundup that that sterilizes
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:58.200]  the soils the loss of probiotics in the soils these are real environmental issues but the
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:05.000]  environmental the i should say the the traditional or let's say the the the status quo environmental
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:12.680]  movement does not address these things where is the the denouncement of gmo's in the
[02:57:12.680 --> 02:57:17.400]  environmental movement i gotta say right here on the air on the record and kill the environmental
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:23.400]  movement denounces gmo's you're a fraud okay you're not for the environment if unless you
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:28.920]  speak out against gmo's gmo's are the greatest threat to our environment it is a self replicating
[02:57:28.920 --> 02:57:34.360]  pollution that's worse than chemical pollution that's worse than the oil spill in the gulf it
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:42.440]  is worse because it self replicates you want to be a real environmentalist get get get aligned
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:49.800]  against gmo's that's save the planet for human life and oh man i do get frustrated on that point
