[00:00.000 --> 00:25.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're starting the new year off here right.
[00:25.360 --> 00:35.960]  I'm your host Alex Jones and this is a very special first transmission or the kickoff
[00:35.960 --> 00:42.240]  of 2015, January 1st, 2015.
[00:42.240 --> 00:44.280]  I would stand in line for this.
[00:44.280 --> 00:45.920]  It's so good to be here.
[00:45.920 --> 00:52.520]  I remember growing up in a little house by Watrack Lake in Dallas and hearing my mother
[00:52.520 --> 01:01.520]  talk about the year 2001, the new millennium, because she was right, 2001 would be the start
[01:01.520 --> 01:05.560]  of the new millennium, not 2000, but little did she know that they would just say, oh,
[01:05.560 --> 01:06.560]  it's just 2000.
[01:06.560 --> 01:09.120]  When 2000 starts, it's the new millennium.
[01:09.120 --> 01:11.560]  No, 2001 is the new millennium.
[01:11.560 --> 01:22.480]  2000 is the completion when it ends of the second thousand years after Christ's birth
[01:22.480 --> 01:23.480]  and death.
[01:23.480 --> 01:30.680]  I guess now they just call it common era, but here we are now 15 years.
[01:30.680 --> 01:41.200]  We're starting the 15th year, so we're technically 14 years into this new millennium.
[01:41.200 --> 01:42.880]  Really amazing.
[01:42.880 --> 01:43.880]  And we'll blink.
[01:43.880 --> 01:47.040]  It'll be 2030.
[01:47.040 --> 01:48.200]  Think about that.
[01:48.200 --> 01:54.600]  When this much time has passed, plus a year, but rounding up, that it's taking to get
[01:54.600 --> 01:59.480]  from 2000 to now, it'll be 2030.
[01:59.480 --> 02:03.600]  Oh, yeah, it'll be Buck Rogers then.
[02:03.600 --> 02:08.000]  It's already Buck Rogers and they're keeping secret much of what's going on.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  We are living in ultra epic times.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.720]  Everything is so interesting.
[02:14.720 --> 02:16.000]  Everything is so amazing.
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.360]  So much is happening.
[02:17.360 --> 02:22.240]  The only people you hear that are bored and unhappy are folks that still believe in and
[02:22.240 --> 02:25.160]  watch mainstream news and television.
[02:25.160 --> 02:29.000]  They think what comes out of that box, that controlled corporate globalist box, is the
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.040]  sum total of the universe.
[02:32.040 --> 02:37.920]  I'm here to tell you what comes out of this little box is tiny compared to the universe,
[02:37.920 --> 02:40.240]  but a lot bigger than what the mainstream media has to offer.
[02:40.240 --> 02:46.600]  They want to keep you shuttered and your doorways of perception to control you and your family.
[02:46.600 --> 02:48.160]  And I'm not here to tell you what to think.
[02:48.160 --> 02:49.240]  I'm here to tell you.
[02:49.240 --> 02:50.600]  You might want to look around.
[02:50.600 --> 02:52.120]  You might want to understand.
[02:52.120 --> 02:57.120]  You can come out of the cave, the allegory of Plato, and there's a whole wide world.
[02:57.120 --> 03:05.520]  And then there's mountains to climb and rockets to ascend in and deep sea operations and exploring
[03:05.520 --> 03:12.680]  the mind and exploring music and poetry and honor and relationships and birth and life
[03:12.680 --> 03:18.720]  and marriage and children and death and the elite merging with machines and brain ships.
[03:18.720 --> 03:22.400]  And just it's incredible.
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.480]  Dystopia meets utopia, meets reality.
[03:27.480 --> 03:30.360]  So instead of just airing a few of the interviews we've had the last few weeks that are great
[03:30.360 --> 03:33.960]  rebroadcasts we do occasionally on Christmas or other holidays.
[03:33.960 --> 03:37.560]  On New Year's Day, I was live on New Year's.
[03:37.560 --> 03:41.880]  On New Year's Day, the crew from the TV side and the radio side have done a great job putting
[03:41.880 --> 03:46.640]  together a little snippet of one of the two Charlton Heston interviews I did, the one
[03:46.640 --> 03:47.640]  we can find.
[03:47.640 --> 03:51.920]  It's bad audio, but the info is interesting to hear that champion of the Second Amendment
[03:51.920 --> 03:54.360]  once more on the broadcast.
[03:54.360 --> 04:01.000]  David Der Rothschild, a globalist who says that Mars is closer to the sun than Earth
[04:01.000 --> 04:02.200]  and other such insanities.
[04:02.200 --> 04:05.320]  Well, he just thinks you're dumb.
[04:05.320 --> 04:10.520]  Viggo Mortensen, one of my favorite big actors, is a listener and he was on the broadcast.
[04:10.520 --> 04:16.040]  Joe Rogan, old time friend on him since like 1998, see Time Flies, Mike Judge, of course
[04:16.040 --> 04:21.120]  the creator of King of the Hill, Beavis and Butthead and more, Talks Tea Party, New World
[04:21.120 --> 04:22.120]  Order.
[04:22.120 --> 04:27.360]  Rowdy Rowdy Piper, Nezo introduction of They Live with Sean Stone, Willie Nelson, an old
[04:27.360 --> 04:29.560]  blast from the past and Russell Brand.
[04:29.560 --> 04:32.800]  When I said, let's get together some of the most interesting celebrity interviews I've
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.400]  done, the list was a lot longer than this, so we're going to have some more of these
[04:36.400 --> 04:38.000]  coming up in the future.
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.640]  But this is a first look at it, doesn't have a lot of great folks there like Dave Mustaine
[04:43.640 --> 04:47.880]  or Billy Corrigan or so many others or Charlie Sheen for that matter, but they'll be in the
[04:47.880 --> 04:50.800]  next round of this coming up.
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.080]  But straight ahead, Charlton Heston, David Der Rothschild, Viggo Mortensen, Joe Rogan,
[04:55.080 --> 04:58.640]  Mike Judge, Rowdy Rowdy Piper, Willie Nelson and more.
[04:58.640 --> 05:00.680]  Stay with us.
[05:00.680 --> 05:04.760]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape, and the truth is it's hard,
[05:04.760 --> 05:09.800]  even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our
[05:09.800 --> 05:11.680]  bodies more than ever before.
[05:11.680 --> 05:16.400]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals,
[05:16.400 --> 05:20.760]  in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers that synergistically worked.
[05:20.760 --> 05:25.240]  I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased
[05:25.240 --> 05:27.800]  stamina and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[05:27.800 --> 05:32.120]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWarsLife Resolution Pack, combining
[05:32.120 --> 05:37.880]  three essential formulations, oxygen-based cleanser oxy-powder, the secret 12 bioavailable

[06:00.600 --> 06:04.240]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[06:04.240 --> 06:08.600]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[06:08.600 --> 06:10.640]  Can you put two and two together?
[06:10.640 --> 06:16.200]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[06:16.200 --> 06:18.240]  priced and fully legal.

[07:18.640 --> 07:23.600]  The fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes

[08:04.320 --> 08:06.320]  Total commitment, 2015.
[08:06.320 --> 08:12.160]  The decision is being made by the president and the joint chiefs in the war room at the
[08:12.160 --> 08:13.160]  Pentagon.
[08:13.160 --> 08:18.840]  And when they realize there is no possibility of recalling the wing, there will be only one
[08:18.840 --> 08:19.840]  course of action open.
[08:19.840 --> 08:20.840]  Total commitment.
[08:20.840 --> 08:21.840]  Total commitment.
[08:21.840 --> 08:26.320]  Andre, do you recall what Clemens once said about war?
[08:26.320 --> 08:30.160]  No, I didn't think I knew what that was about.
[08:30.160 --> 08:33.800]  He said war was too important to be left to the generals.
[08:33.800 --> 08:38.760]  When he said that 50 years ago, he might have been right.
[08:38.760 --> 08:43.760]  But today, war is too important to be left to politicians.
[08:43.760 --> 08:52.320]  They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.
[08:52.320 --> 08:55.920]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[08:55.920 --> 08:56.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:56.920 --> 09:02.160]  We're doing something a little different here today.
[09:02.160 --> 09:05.200]  It is the first day of 2015.
[09:05.200 --> 09:06.200]  We made it.
[09:06.200 --> 09:07.200]  Can you believe it?
[09:07.200 --> 09:08.200]  By the grace of God.
[09:08.200 --> 09:11.000]  This is going to be an amazing year.
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.600]  The good, the bad, and the ugly will all show its ugly head.
[09:14.600 --> 09:21.040]  This is a really old interview from a long time ago, from back in 2001.
[09:21.040 --> 09:23.160]  And the audio quality's not that good.
[09:23.160 --> 09:25.560]  But it's Charlton Heston from the archives.
[09:25.560 --> 09:30.200]  Then David Der Rothschild on the hot seat and more coming up today.
[09:30.200 --> 09:33.280]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and FullWars.com.
[09:33.280 --> 09:38.760]  I don't say that lightly.
[09:38.760 --> 09:43.560]  Everybody knows who Charlton Heston is, and it really made the socialist in the culture
[09:43.560 --> 09:48.600]  war, as Mr. Heston calls it, angry when he stepped up at the plate a couple years ago
[09:48.600 --> 09:53.000]  back into the Second Amendment fight, and now his new book is amazing, The Courage to
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  Be Free.
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.800]  Why did you decide to get back really involved in the Second Amendment fight at the forefront
[09:58.800 --> 10:01.760]  and to write this new book, The Courage to Be Free?
[10:01.760 --> 10:04.840]  Well, of course, I've been involved with the Second Amendment.
[10:04.840 --> 10:09.640]  You could say, since I was a little kid, shooting a deer up in Michigan.
[10:09.640 --> 10:17.680]  But then I became involved more seriously with the Bill of Rights, and I came to see
[10:17.680 --> 10:23.720]  the importance of defending every one of the 12 articles of the Bill of Rights, of which
[10:23.720 --> 10:26.880]  the second is the right to keep and bear arms.
[10:26.880 --> 10:30.800]  And we had a lot of success with it in the last election.
[10:30.800 --> 10:37.040]  Well, we see the mainstream media that controlled propaganda arms is what I call them, and I
[10:37.040 --> 10:43.240]  think they've shown themselves to deserve that title, convincing a lot of people that
[10:43.240 --> 10:45.520]  the average American isn't for the Second Amendment.
[10:45.520 --> 10:49.960]  But if you can explain to people the basics of how it's there to defend us from the street
[10:49.960 --> 10:55.760]  thug, the government thug, or to put food on the table, not to mention just as a sporting
[10:55.760 --> 10:59.960]  enjoyment and heritage, most people are actually for it.
[10:59.960 --> 11:02.520]  John Ashcroft right now, they're trying to confirm him.
[11:02.520 --> 11:04.440]  I think he would be a good...
[11:04.440 --> 11:07.040]  I think he will be confirmed.
[11:07.040 --> 11:13.080]  I think he will make a fine attorney general, certainly a far better one than Janet Reno.
[11:13.080 --> 11:16.240]  But absolutely, that wouldn't be too hard to do.
[11:16.240 --> 11:22.080]  But Mr. Kennedy, who I really don't think has any room to talk with all the skeletons
[11:22.080 --> 11:23.800]  in his closet, began to attack...
[11:23.800 --> 11:30.320]  There is no one in the U.S. Senate that has more skeletons in his closet than Kennedy.
[11:30.320 --> 11:32.480]  He should be ashamed of himself, he really should.
[11:32.480 --> 11:40.960]  I worked for his older brother, I voted for him, I campaigned for him, but Teddy Kennedy
[11:40.960 --> 11:45.040]  is another piece of work, exactly.
[11:45.040 --> 11:52.240]  But anyway, to return to the question of the Second Amendment, there are, for example,
[11:52.240 --> 12:00.160]  now 41 states that have concealed carry laws, meaning that if you pass a background check,
[12:00.160 --> 12:06.080]  show that you have no felony convictions of any kind, show that you demonstrate that
[12:06.080 --> 12:13.600]  you know how to use a firearm safely, you can then get a permit to carry a concealed
[12:13.600 --> 12:17.640]  carry weapon under your arm or wherever.
[12:17.640 --> 12:22.720]  It's not something I don't want to do because I don't fear, I've used too many pistols
[12:22.720 --> 12:25.360]  and too many movies, they're kind of heavy to carry.
[12:25.360 --> 12:33.080]  But anyway, the point is that in every one of the 42 states where there is concealed
[12:33.080 --> 12:40.760]  carry laws, one, the murder rate, the crime rate, two, never mind the murder rate, the
[12:40.760 --> 12:47.360]  crime rate has dropped significantly, significantly in every one of those states.
[12:47.360 --> 12:52.600]  That's why, because of course, most people who have this permit don't carry all the
[12:52.600 --> 12:58.120]  time, but the point is the bad guys don't know who's carrying and who isn't.
[12:58.120 --> 13:03.000]  So that is, of course, you don't need to have to carry them.
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.960]  You know, I have to say, much as I admired his big brother, I think Teddy Kennedy is
[13:08.960 --> 13:14.120]  one of the worst members of the U.S. Senate.
[13:14.120 --> 13:21.600]  I really feel that, and he shoots his mouth off and he has the right to do so as a U.S.
[13:21.600 --> 13:23.800]  Senator, but he is not a good one.
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.880]  Well, I think they show their hatred for the Second Amendment.
[13:27.880 --> 13:32.320]  You talk about a culture war a lot in your newest book and, of course, in your eloquent
[13:32.320 --> 13:33.320]  speeches.
[13:33.320 --> 13:39.000]  I almost fell over when I saw you on one of the NRA news shows when you said, you can
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.360]  take it from my cold, dead hand, you raised up a musket.
[13:42.360 --> 13:52.440]  Yeah, that worked out very well, but I think, you know, I can give you any number of examples.
[13:52.440 --> 14:00.880]  For example, do you know the largest and fastest growing group of purchasers of small handguns
[14:00.880 --> 14:04.120]  in the country, single women?
[14:04.120 --> 14:05.120]  Of course.
[14:05.120 --> 14:11.160]  There are women with permanently absent husbands who have two or three kids, they're trying
[14:11.160 --> 14:14.560]  to support, they want to spend some time with them, so that means they have to be there
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.360]  when they're home from school, which means they have to work, make a living, because
[14:19.360 --> 14:27.320]  the husband's long gone, by cleaning off his buildings till 3, 4 o'clock in the morning,
[14:27.320 --> 14:32.360]  and then they ride the bus within three or four blocks of where they live, but then they
[14:32.360 --> 14:38.080]  got to walk those last blocks in the dark all by themselves, so of course they want
[14:38.080 --> 14:42.400]  a small pistol in their purse.
[14:42.400 --> 14:47.000]  And how dare this corrupt government, those running it, especially the Democrats, tell
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.960]  women they don't have that right.
[14:48.960 --> 14:53.040]  I'm sure you've heard that the Solicitor General has said that the Second Amendment,
[14:53.040 --> 14:55.040]  Mr. Heston, does not extend the individuals.
[14:55.040 --> 14:58.840]  Yeah, I've read that, but of course that's not true.
[14:58.840 --> 15:05.440]  Every one of the founding fathers, those wise old dead white guys that invented the country,
[15:05.440 --> 15:12.160]  every one of them is elaborately on record at the time about the importance of the Second
[15:12.160 --> 15:18.880]  Amendment, and the meaning of the Second Amendment, it is simply impossible to deny that, and
[15:18.880 --> 15:26.760]  the efforts of the anti-gun bomb are just specious.
[15:26.760 --> 15:29.520]  You're talking about the Federalist Papers documenting the truth, Jim?
[15:29.520 --> 15:34.360]  Yes, of course, and the Bill of Rights itself, and the Federalist Papers, but also while
[15:34.360 --> 15:43.960]  they were drafting the Bill of Rights, they went, they wrote, every one of them wrote
[15:43.960 --> 15:49.200]  papers on this, as you said, one of the Federalist Papers.
[15:49.200 --> 15:54.920]  tyranny, I mean isn't that one of the strongest arguments against gun control and restricting
[15:54.920 --> 15:55.920]  law?
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.480]  Absolutely, and I'm so glad you asked me that question, because if we consider that
[16:01.480 --> 16:10.000]  our revolution was the first and most significant close to a democratic government since the
[16:10.000 --> 16:17.280]  founding of the Roman Republic, then following our revolution successful was the French Revolution,
[16:17.280 --> 16:24.840]  which quickly collapsed into the bloody terror followed by the dictatorship of Napoleon,
[16:24.840 --> 16:30.520]  followed in due time by the dictatorships of Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin, and mind
[16:30.520 --> 16:38.000]  you, two of those men, both Hitler and Mussolini, were elected by a democratic procedure, and
[16:38.000 --> 16:44.280]  then we get to Paul Pot and Laurent Kabila, who was killed just a day before yesterday,
[16:44.280 --> 16:54.800]  I believe, I think God will not miss him, and Maltese Tongue, and of course Fidel Castro,
[16:54.800 --> 16:59.760]  and every one of these monsters, and I think it's fair to call them that, every one of
[16:59.760 --> 17:05.480]  them, their first act on taking office, including the two that were elected democratically,
[17:05.480 --> 17:12.160]  their first thing they did was to confiscate all privately held firearms, the defense
[17:12.160 --> 17:13.160]  arrests.
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.640]  Absolutely, Mr. Heston, again, Donaldson Heston, ladies and gentlemen, in fact I've looked
[17:17.640 --> 17:23.560]  at the actual numbers and accountants and others have, and the states with the highest
[17:23.560 --> 17:28.200]  taxes have the most egregious gun control, I don't think that's an accident.
[17:28.200 --> 17:33.480]  No, I don't think so either, it's the firm intent of the liberal left, no question.
[17:33.480 --> 17:37.840]  Well, how can they even get away with the term liberal, meaning they're into freedom?
[17:37.840 --> 17:43.120]  I see the so-called liberal left militarizing the police, building prisons everywhere, and
[17:43.120 --> 17:44.960]  going after good people's guns.
[17:44.960 --> 17:51.960]  Well, of course, originally, the idea of being a liberal meant a certain concern for the
[17:51.960 --> 17:56.280]  rights of the individual, now it doesn't mean anything like that, now it means the rights
[17:56.280 --> 18:01.080]  of the government, and we have to constantly stand against that.
[18:01.080 --> 18:07.760]  Well, the left has really had a problem coming after you because on the subject of the God
[18:07.760 --> 18:11.200]  given rights of black people in this country, you were right out there at the forefront
[18:11.200 --> 18:14.800]  fighting when there were real environmental problems, you were out there at the forefront
[18:14.800 --> 18:19.080]  fighting, and now they're like, what is Heston doing, he's out there fighting for the Second
[18:19.080 --> 18:25.560]  Amendment, how dare he, I actually saw some guys on one of the big classic movie shows
[18:25.560 --> 18:29.280]  bad-mouthing you before they aired Soylent Green, which is one of my favorites.
[18:29.280 --> 18:35.560]  There you go, but I have to tell you, on the other day on Martin Luther King Day, I was
[18:35.560 --> 18:42.440]  invited by CORE to attend a banquet, and I was the principal speaker, and they gave
[18:42.440 --> 18:48.800]  me a bus to Dr. King, which having spent as much time as I was able to do with him, I'm
[18:48.800 --> 18:51.200]  very proud to have.
[18:51.200 --> 18:54.960]  So it's really hard for them to attack your record, I mean, this really is another human
[18:54.960 --> 18:57.000]  right to be able to defend ourselves.
[18:57.000 --> 19:03.440]  Absolutely, it is certainly among the first of human rights.
[19:03.440 --> 19:07.320]  Last question, where do you see the fight in the next two years?
[19:07.320 --> 19:11.320]  I think it's critical if the socialists, known as the Democrats, win control of the
[19:11.320 --> 19:17.040]  House and the Senate, we could even in four years have the first gentleman bill back in
[19:17.040 --> 19:19.120]  the line house with Hillary as the president.
[19:19.120 --> 19:25.280]  No, we couldn't get Mr. Clinton back, that would be against the Constitution.
[19:25.280 --> 19:29.960]  Yeah, twenty-second a minute, but he'll still be back in the White House as the first gentleman,
[19:29.960 --> 19:30.960]  see the joke.
[19:30.960 --> 19:34.600]  Yeah, do you think Mr. Clinton can be elected?
[19:34.600 --> 19:36.800]  I don't think so.
[19:36.800 --> 19:37.800]  I'm not sure.
[19:37.800 --> 19:40.640]  Well, we're going to have to work on that, aren't we?
[19:40.640 --> 19:46.600]  I'm glad to see the NRA getting more hardcore, you know, we've got to do it, it's too important.
[19:46.600 --> 19:51.600]  We've tried to keep out of that fight, but I think it's this last election proved it
[19:51.600 --> 19:54.040]  was important to stay with it.
[19:54.040 --> 20:05.600]  Every American should vote.
[20:05.600 --> 20:12.240]  And we are joined by David Mayer, the Rothschild, Al Gore of course is kicking off a string
[20:12.240 --> 20:20.080]  of global concerts this weekend on 777 and the man who's written the official book that
[20:20.080 --> 20:29.240]  is the accompaniment to this meant for elementary grade school children is David Mayer the Rothschild
[20:29.240 --> 20:35.000]  born in 1978, a British adventurer, I love that title, an environmentalist who is the
[20:35.000 --> 20:40.680]  head of Adventure Ecology, an expedition group raising awareness about climate change.
[20:40.680 --> 20:45.840]  He is the youngest of the three children of Sir Evelyn and the Rothschild of the Rothschild
[20:45.840 --> 20:53.600]  banking family of England, one of the arrows shooting out across the planet invigorating
[20:53.600 --> 20:54.600]  everything.
[20:54.600 --> 20:58.280]  Mr. Rothschild, thank you for coming on the show with us today.
[20:58.280 --> 21:00.680]  Thank you for having me on the show.
[21:00.680 --> 21:02.320]  That's quite an introduction there.
[21:02.320 --> 21:03.320]  Thank you.
[21:03.320 --> 21:04.320]  You bet.
[21:04.320 --> 21:11.400]  I've got a new poll out here, the Maury poll shows that most people in the UK remain unconvinced
[21:11.400 --> 21:16.480]  about warnings that our climate is being affected by global warming.
[21:16.480 --> 21:22.680]  What is the science proving that man-made global warming A is real and B will cause
[21:22.680 --> 21:24.680]  cataclysmic problems?
[21:24.680 --> 21:30.120]  I think the report you really need to be looking at was a report that was released at the beginning
[21:30.120 --> 21:34.760]  of the year by the IPCC, which is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
[21:34.760 --> 21:40.440]  It's made up of 2,500 scientists from around the world, all in the field of climatic studies.
[21:40.440 --> 21:42.040]  These are the brains, basically.
[21:42.040 --> 21:46.520]  These are the guys who have been looking at this stuff for a very long time.
[21:46.520 --> 21:50.440]  They come together, they put this report together, and there was a unanimous decision
[21:50.440 --> 21:52.960]  made and put across in this report.
[21:52.960 --> 21:58.240]  Mr. Rothschild, a whole bunch of people, hundreds of them have gone public saying that they
[21:58.240 --> 22:03.480]  were included and asked their opinion in research, but that many of them never said that they
[22:03.480 --> 22:09.080]  agreed with man-made global warming or its causative effects.
[22:09.080 --> 22:12.240]  I think that if you read the report, they actually do.
[22:12.240 --> 22:13.240]  They come out and they say...
[22:13.240 --> 22:16.760]  No, they say their names were added falsely to that report.
[22:16.760 --> 22:19.040]  Are you aware of that global controversy?
[22:19.040 --> 22:20.880]  It's been in hundreds of newspapers.
[22:20.880 --> 22:26.560]  I think the fact of the matter is that this type of argument about whether global warming
[22:26.560 --> 22:31.760]  exists or not is a waste of time.
[22:31.760 --> 22:35.840]  Now we all know last year that the media got caught, a national geographic, the known propaganda
[22:35.840 --> 22:39.320]  channel got caught, showing images of polar bears saying, look at them, they're stranded
[22:39.320 --> 22:40.320]  on ice.
[22:40.320 --> 22:44.480]  All of Earth's species are threatened.
[22:44.480 --> 22:48.360]  Some may disappear forever.
[22:48.360 --> 22:49.960]  Polar bears can swim 200 miles.
[22:49.960 --> 22:54.400]  You and I both know that, but you know the dumb public that the globalists are always
[22:54.400 --> 22:59.480]  hoodwinking doesn't know that, and you've got new IMAX programs and new Disney programs
[22:59.480 --> 23:02.520]  coming up going, look at the drowning polar bears.
[23:02.520 --> 23:04.960]  They're all dying because the ice is melting.
[23:04.960 --> 23:08.800]  Everyone knows that the glaciers expand and contract and are collapsing continually.
[23:08.800 --> 23:12.320]  Go ahead, there's your answer.
[23:12.320 --> 23:13.320]  What's your point?
[23:13.320 --> 23:15.120]  I think you still haven't even asked me.
[23:15.120 --> 23:20.960]  My point is that you guys are setting up global taxation, as Al Gore has said.
[23:20.960 --> 23:22.480]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[23:22.480 --> 23:25.840]  I am concerned about cross species genetic engineering.
[23:25.840 --> 23:28.880]  I am concerned about destroying old growth, forest.
[23:28.880 --> 23:33.000]  I am worried about those type of things, but you guys are gobbling up all the world's
[23:33.000 --> 23:38.080]  concern to just simply line your pockets and make kids read your book in schools and do
[23:38.080 --> 23:39.080]  all this.
[23:39.080 --> 23:41.080]  It's a business, just like you said, Rothschild.
[23:41.080 --> 23:44.040]  Do you think I make any money out of this?
[23:44.040 --> 23:49.720]  Of course, I should bring up to Mr. Rothschild that the polar ice caps of Mars are receding
[23:49.720 --> 23:56.720]  at several miles a year, much faster than ours, and that the moons of Saturn and Jupiter
[23:56.720 --> 23:57.720]  are melting.
[23:57.720 --> 24:01.720]  In fact, several of their moons were ice and are now liquid seas.
[24:01.720 --> 24:05.720]  Now, how are SUVs causing that, David Rothschild?
[24:05.720 --> 24:09.720]  That's because those planets are closest to the sun, my friend.
[24:09.720 --> 24:13.760]  No, Jupiter and Saturn are not closer to the sun.
[24:13.760 --> 24:14.760]  Neither is Mars.
[24:14.760 --> 24:15.760]  Yes, sir.
[24:15.760 --> 24:19.440]  I think you'll find, right, that the very simple matter and what I want to defend is
[24:19.440 --> 24:23.480]  my final point, and then I'll let you continue with your line that global warming doesn't
[24:23.480 --> 24:24.480]  exist.
[24:24.480 --> 24:29.080]  I find it very sad that we're still in a day and age where there is a certain mentality
[24:29.080 --> 24:33.560]  or a certain sector that wants to deny that these things are happening, and you say you
[24:33.560 --> 24:36.200]  don't believe that human beings are responsible for climate change.
[24:36.200 --> 24:39.360]  That's fine, and I respect your opinion, I respect your views.
[24:39.360 --> 24:44.400]  I think, though, that you have to realize, if you look at the science, forget your taxation
[24:44.400 --> 24:46.520]  theory, because actually it's not taxation.
[24:46.520 --> 24:51.760]  What it's trying to do, the taxation that is sitting there is one tiny fragment of saying
[24:51.760 --> 24:56.720]  that the polluters of our planet, the companies that are excessively polluting, the only way
[24:56.720 --> 25:01.200]  that they will respond and listen is if they're incentivized through a tax scheme to stop
[25:01.200 --> 25:02.200]  them polluting.
[25:02.200 --> 25:06.800]  And that tax scheme isn't in your pocket, that is the companies, the exons of this world,
[25:06.800 --> 25:11.800]  the companies that are going out there and needlessly polluting off water systems or
[25:11.800 --> 25:12.800]  natural systems.
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.200]  I think it's sad that you can, you know, I appreciate and respect people's views on
[25:18.200 --> 25:22.520]  both sides of the argument, that's what a debate is about, and I appreciate your views
[25:22.520 --> 25:27.320]  in taking this debate to me, but I would also say that it's sad because what you're doing
[25:27.320 --> 25:29.560]  here is giving people a false sense of hope.
[25:29.560 --> 25:34.480]  Our planet is in a seriously bad way right now, and if we continue to put out this rhetoric
[25:34.480 --> 25:38.280]  which says this doesn't exist, which you are doing and you are promoting, then all it's
[25:38.280 --> 25:42.760]  going to do is delay the situation that is going to cause more problems for your children,
[25:42.760 --> 25:44.760]  for my children, and the future of this planet.
[25:44.760 --> 25:49.400]  You're saying we need to have a stable climate, sir, the planet's never had a stable climate.
[25:49.400 --> 25:50.400]  The planet hasn't.
[25:50.400 --> 25:55.920]  For the last 12,000 years, we've been at a very, very stable comparatively for the four
[25:55.920 --> 26:00.400]  and a half billion years, the planet's in a period of climatic systems, our systems
[26:00.400 --> 26:01.400]  have been incredibly stable.
[26:01.400 --> 26:05.960]  I agree with you, we need carbon as a driver of life, I'm not denying that, you know.
[26:05.960 --> 26:10.400]  We have huge pockets of reserves of carbon, which are under which for millions of years
[26:10.400 --> 26:14.840]  to take and millions of years to spend stored under our earth's crust.
[26:14.840 --> 26:18.600]  We are releasing that, and we're putting it up, and let's not confuse two things here.
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.360]  Let's not confuse biological carbon and carbon that's in the picture of burning fossil fuels.
[26:23.360 --> 26:26.080]  One is inert and stays in atmosphere, and one goes through the natural cycle.
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.600]  So we're confusing two things when we're pumping out, we're going to be pumping out excess carbon
[26:30.600 --> 26:35.000]  more than the natural system, but we're flashing burn agriculture, we're cutting down our carbon
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.960]  sinks to balance that.
[26:36.960 --> 26:42.640]  Our oceans in creditific areas, they absorb 40% of our world's atmospheric carbon.
[26:42.640 --> 26:44.560]  Oh, I agree with that, I agree that...
[26:44.560 --> 26:46.840]  And if our temperatures get warmer, the planet goes...
[26:46.840 --> 26:51.960]  Let me just say this, see, but see, you're tying together plankton blooms and different
[26:51.960 --> 26:57.680]  differentials in with carbon dioxide itself, and is it the different, and it's not just
[26:57.680 --> 27:02.520]  one tax, I mean, they're now tying the different environmental movements that, oh, we need
[27:02.520 --> 27:07.600]  a tax on more than one child, which really is a one child policy.
[27:07.600 --> 27:12.400]  So we already see this whole move to restrict carbon, really a tax on life, a tax on breathing.
[27:12.400 --> 27:15.360]  I don't think it's a tax on life and a tax on breathing.
[27:15.360 --> 27:19.560]  I think the fact of the matter is, we have one planet, we don't have a spare one.
[27:19.560 --> 27:22.920]  We know that our systems, and whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call
[27:22.920 --> 27:28.360]  it a cyclical change, whether you want to call it global warming, everyone has their
[27:28.360 --> 27:29.360]  own opinion.
[27:29.360 --> 27:33.800]  And I think the fact of the matter is, for me personally, the time for debate is over.
[27:33.800 --> 27:38.080]  This is no longer about, does it exist, does it not exist, who's doing what, who's not.
[27:38.080 --> 27:41.040]  As we keep on talking, the planet, the very thing that supports...
[27:41.040 --> 27:45.320]  So we need to just stop thinking and just agree it's happening, and go do whatever Al
[27:45.320 --> 27:49.000]  Gore says, and just, and just, world government will save us.
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.440]  Well, okay, in a perfect world, what should we do, Rock Child?
[27:53.440 --> 27:54.440]  In the perfect world...
[27:54.440 --> 27:55.840]  What should we do to save ourselves?
[27:55.840 --> 27:56.840]  Tell me, save me.
[27:56.840 --> 27:57.840]  You can't listen.
[27:57.840 --> 27:58.840]  Save me.
[27:58.840 --> 28:02.520]  In the perfect world, sir, you start to use common sense, which is obviously something
[28:02.520 --> 28:06.600]  that some, yes, from some of your comments, I'm afraid I don't see.
[28:06.600 --> 28:07.600]  Save me.
[28:07.600 --> 28:08.600]  Oh, God.
[28:08.600 --> 28:09.600]  You save me, young ladies.
[28:09.600 --> 28:14.600]  Oh, Lord Rock Child, save me, you're such a dashing adventurer, like Indiana Jones.
[28:14.600 --> 28:18.240]  Oh, Lord Rock Child, save me, Lord Rock Child.
[28:18.240 --> 28:19.240]  You sound like...
[28:19.240 --> 28:20.240]  You sound like...
[28:20.240 --> 28:21.960]  Listen, I've missed the oil bar, I'm sitting in front of the...
[28:21.960 --> 28:25.400]  If you want to start making funny noises like that on the phone, that's fair enough,
[28:25.400 --> 28:29.920]  oil boy, so get back onto your little rodeo ball, go out there and deny it all, protect
[28:29.920 --> 28:35.400]  your oil shares, and make sure that your kids, who you talk to, don't have any planet to
[28:35.400 --> 28:36.400]  live on.
[28:36.400 --> 28:37.400]  Well, there's always...
[28:37.400 --> 28:42.880]  Now, hold on, I've read quite a few history books, even back at the time of Waterloo,
[28:42.880 --> 28:48.680]  when your family was so active, we've got all sorts of fires and storms and floods and
[28:48.680 --> 28:49.680]  things going on.
[28:49.680 --> 28:55.680]  I mean, which doctors, 5,000 years ago, had pointed an eclipse or pointed a wildfire point
[28:55.680 --> 29:00.800]  at a snowstorm and say, you better bring better offerings to my tent or I'll make the ugabugas
[29:00.800 --> 29:01.800]  get you?
[29:01.800 --> 29:09.280]  I mean, really, is it just a organizing system to bring in global taxation and regulations
[29:09.280 --> 29:10.280]  this whole...
[29:10.280 --> 29:12.480]  I mean, what is your solution to the global warming?
[29:12.480 --> 29:13.480]  Is it not the global...
[29:13.480 --> 29:17.120]  Hold on, is it not the global carbon tax, as Al Gore's called for?
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.920]  It's...there's many things, I think what you have to realize is that being environmentally
[29:21.920 --> 29:24.560]  sensitive and making money aren't mutually exclusive.
[29:24.560 --> 29:34.720]  There's a lot of money to be made in addressing this issue.
[29:34.720 --> 29:39.600]  Coming up after the break, the host of UFC, you name it, TV shows, movies, a good friend
[29:39.600 --> 29:42.800]  of mine, definitely a free thinker, Joe Rogan.
[29:42.800 --> 29:46.760]  And then, of course, also, Vigo Mortensen needs no introduction.
[29:46.760 --> 29:48.560]  All this and more straight ahead.
[29:48.560 --> 29:49.560]  It's January...
[29:49.560 --> 29:51.120]  We're on the march.
[29:51.120 --> 29:53.600]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.600 --> 30:00.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.720 --> 30:05.280]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation,

[30:24.920 --> 30:26.420]  essential nutrients.
[30:26.420 --> 30:29.320]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[30:29.320 --> 30:31.040]  No needles, no ejections.
[30:31.040 --> 30:35.080]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems.

[31:00.600 --> 31:03.200]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[31:03.200 --> 31:07.880]  And the truth is, it's hard, even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food in our
[31:07.880 --> 31:11.640]  environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before.
[31:11.640 --> 31:16.360]  Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I've found that super high-quality nutraceuticals,
[31:16.360 --> 31:20.720]  in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers that synergistically worked.
[31:20.720 --> 31:25.200]  I could see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased
[31:25.200 --> 31:27.760]  stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye.
[31:27.760 --> 31:32.080]  That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWarsLife Resolution Pack, combining

[32:00.360 --> 32:04.040]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[32:04.040 --> 32:08.400]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[32:08.400 --> 32:10.400]  Can you put two and two together?

[32:40.200 --> 32:41.960]  energy at the same time.

[33:09.200 --> 33:14.840]  It was about six and a half years ago, Obama was president-elect, and I sat in here in
[33:14.840 --> 33:19.760]  this very green room at Capacity Comedy Club, Joe, that videos would see about 40 million
[33:19.760 --> 33:26.000]  times now, literally, like 14 million, just one spot on YouTube, that's ridiculous.
[33:26.000 --> 33:31.160]  You early on, when everybody else was saying Obama was the savior, you were saying, why
[33:31.160 --> 33:36.440]  does anybody expect him to be any different, and it was like right when he was president-elect
[33:36.440 --> 33:37.840]  or right when he got out of office.
[33:37.840 --> 33:42.040]  It's pretty obvious that there's some gigantic financial institutions that have been pulling
[33:42.040 --> 33:46.440]  the strings of politicians in this country for a long time, and that that's the fact
[33:46.440 --> 33:51.040]  that we have it set up where they can donate millions of dollars to these guys' fuzz, these
[33:51.040 --> 33:52.040]  guys' campaigns.
[33:52.040 --> 33:55.600]  I mean, how do we not expect it all to go bad?
[33:55.600 --> 33:58.840]  They put so much into him, built him up as his big brand name, what's your take on me?
[33:58.840 --> 34:02.560]  Well, you know what, man, I don't even think Obama is to blame.
[34:02.560 --> 34:03.560]  I really don't.
[34:03.560 --> 34:06.680]  I don't think there's an individual that's to blame.
[34:06.680 --> 34:12.080]  I think that what we're looking at, and I'm obviously no political expert by any means,
[34:12.080 --> 34:20.640]  is a person who's observing a system, who's a person who's observing this strange society
[34:20.640 --> 34:26.920]  that we live in, and how it's influenced by money and corporations and how politicians
[34:26.920 --> 34:32.080]  are beholden to so many different groups before they get into any positions of power.
[34:32.080 --> 34:39.600]  It's incredibly difficult to change anything, and it's not like this statement about Obama
[34:39.600 --> 34:42.120]  as a president or Obama as a person.
[34:42.120 --> 34:48.960]  It's more that the system is so intertangled, it's so intertwined with political interest
[34:48.960 --> 34:56.480]  groups and with lobbyists and with corporations having mad control over the political system,
[34:56.480 --> 35:03.400]  over who gets represented, which party, you know, who represents which party, the people
[35:03.400 --> 35:06.160]  that have the most money historically have done the best.
[35:06.160 --> 35:10.440]  I mean, it's like a big, crazy money grab, and then these people get into these positions
[35:10.440 --> 35:16.840]  of power, and I don't think they have nearly as much control as we like to think they do.
[35:16.840 --> 35:23.680]  I think America likes to be a proud country, and we like to look at ourselves as really
[35:23.680 --> 35:26.280]  like a special type of people.
[35:26.280 --> 35:31.200]  We're the children of immigrants, the crazy people that came here when everybody else
[35:31.200 --> 35:34.240]  was banking on Europe, and we were like, let's get on a boat.
[35:34.240 --> 35:38.000]  And hundreds of years ago, those were our ancestors, and this is where we are today.
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.560]  But if you look at our actions, it's depressing for people to look at the actions of their
[35:44.560 --> 35:50.440]  country and not totally be able to defend some of what we've done militarily, you know.
[35:50.440 --> 35:53.120]  When people look at that and they go, I don't, you know, there's a lot of people that I
[35:53.120 --> 35:58.280]  know that are patriots, a lot of people that I know that are veterans, that love America,
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.640]  that believe in the military, and they're very upset with the way the direction of these
[36:02.640 --> 36:04.680]  wars has gone.
[36:04.680 --> 36:08.720]  Very upset with the image that it's given America worldwide.
[36:08.720 --> 36:16.880]  You know, this is the famous point that many people had right after September 11th was,
[36:16.880 --> 36:22.720]  this is an incredible time where there was so much sympathy of these other nations.
[36:22.720 --> 36:25.160]  They were so on the side of America that America had been attacked.
[36:25.160 --> 36:26.160]  This is horrible.
[36:26.160 --> 36:27.160]  The whole world was watching.
[36:27.160 --> 36:35.080]  And within a period of a few years, our actions were so fucked up that we lost all that sympathy.
[36:35.080 --> 36:40.840]  We like, there was this moment where America had this position of love, you know, where
[36:40.840 --> 36:44.280]  the whole world was like, hey, we're sorry that happened to you.
[36:44.280 --> 36:49.600]  And by the actions, the mistakes, those are pushed, the pull, whatever it was that led
[36:49.600 --> 36:56.760]  us from September 11, 2001 to where we are in 2014, whatever it is that led us to that,
[36:56.760 --> 36:58.720]  it bums a lot of people out, you know.
[36:58.720 --> 37:02.840]  Everyone can, in 1999, I'd be telling you about that stuff and how they were listening
[37:02.840 --> 37:03.840]  to everything.
[37:03.840 --> 37:07.840]  Dude, you thought that, you thought they were spying on everything way before anybody did.
[37:07.840 --> 37:10.840]  But I might too, my horn, I didn't, I wasn't psychic.
[37:10.840 --> 37:11.840]  Yeah, but it's not just that.
[37:11.840 --> 37:12.840]  It was in the documents.
[37:12.840 --> 37:15.360]  There's also, you have the documents, you have the documents.
[37:15.360 --> 37:21.200]  One thing that I always tell everybody, like, the first, the first video that I ever saw
[37:21.200 --> 37:29.640]  that made me go, what, they do that, that's real, was your 9-1-1 road to tyranny documentary
[37:29.640 --> 37:32.640]  where you detailed what happened in the World Trade Organization.
[37:32.640 --> 37:33.640]  Oh yeah.
[37:33.640 --> 37:40.880]  The WTO protests, we detailed how they used these guys to come in and these agent provocateurs.
[37:40.880 --> 37:44.320]  They were, it was a peaceful protest in order to make it non-peaceful.
[37:44.320 --> 37:49.000]  They had these guys coming with government issue boots, ski masks, everything up, smashed
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.400]  things, and then they turn it into, like, war zones and the cops get to move in and
[37:53.400 --> 37:54.400]  arrest everybody.
[37:54.400 --> 37:56.680]  They made the whole thing a no-protest zone.
[37:56.680 --> 37:59.640]  These guys, they would hold up in some house somewhere, right?
[37:59.640 --> 38:02.320]  Yeah, they would get up and pay for their house.
[38:02.320 --> 38:04.240]  And then they negotiated them free.
[38:04.240 --> 38:05.320]  They got free.
[38:05.320 --> 38:07.840]  So these guys, they, like, smashed all these windows.
[38:07.840 --> 38:09.840]  And they had the Delta Force running them.
[38:09.840 --> 38:12.880]  They even came out, I mean, people in Seattle knew about that.
[38:12.880 --> 38:16.240]  I was being called a conspiracy theorist just because I had the local newspapers from there.
[38:16.240 --> 38:18.440]  It sounds so crazy.
[38:18.440 --> 38:20.360]  When someone tells you that, you go, that's crazy.
[38:20.360 --> 38:26.360]  But then you find out that is actually a tactic that gets used to break up protests.
[38:26.360 --> 38:31.960]  McDonald's, they're dumping over garbage cans, and they are very angry again in hostel.
[38:31.960 --> 38:36.160]  We're seeing more clashes of other protesters telling them to stop because they're giving
[38:36.160 --> 38:37.720]  everyone a bad name.
[38:37.720 --> 38:40.560]  That WTO stuff is one of the most telling things I've ever seen.
[38:40.560 --> 38:42.360]  I was like, wow, that's really what they do.
[38:42.360 --> 38:43.360]  They really do do that.
[38:43.360 --> 38:45.360]  But it makes sense.
[38:45.360 --> 38:48.800]  All right, all right, getting serious, Robin Williams.
[38:48.800 --> 38:50.800]  Wow, that's sad.
[38:50.800 --> 38:52.800]  It's just sad.
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.960]  Yeah, it's sad when anybody has depression, and when a guy who's so beloved doesn't feel
[38:58.960 --> 39:06.440]  it and kills himself, it seems almost, almost impossibly tragic, you know?
[39:06.440 --> 39:07.440]  I met him.
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.800]  I met Robin Williams at the Hollywood Improv, and I didn't know it was him until I was in
[39:12.800 --> 39:15.200]  the middle of talking to him.
[39:15.200 --> 39:20.000]  I did a show, and there was a line of people after the show that were taking pictures,
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.720]  and I was taking pictures of all these people, and this guy comes up, and he starts telling
[39:23.720 --> 39:27.360]  me, he's just being really complimentary, telling me he loved this one bit that I did
[39:27.360 --> 39:31.960]  about dolphins, and then I'm looking at him, and I'm realizing, oh, this is Robin Williams.
[39:31.960 --> 39:36.840]  I thought I was just talking to some guy in the middle of talking to him, like, this
[39:36.840 --> 39:42.400]  is what he was, there was no pretense, nothing weird about him, he's a giant movie star.
[39:42.400 --> 39:47.280]  He waited in line with all the other people, and he had a hat on in glasses, and I didn't
[39:47.280 --> 39:48.280]  know it was him.
[39:48.280 --> 39:53.880]  I literally didn't know it was him until he was, like, two minutes into our conversation.
[39:53.880 --> 40:03.640]  That you are here, that life exists, and identity, that the powerful play goes on, and you may
[40:03.640 --> 40:05.160]  contribute a verse.
[40:05.160 --> 40:11.120]  I agree and I disagree with you on your Chemtrail show, on Conspiracies, that was a good show.
[40:11.120 --> 40:12.680]  Are you still doing that show?
[40:12.680 --> 40:14.000]  No, I don't think so.
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.560]  Well, we're still talking, but if we do do it, it's going to be in a different way.
[40:19.560 --> 40:24.320]  Because with that, there was a problem with that show, and one of the problems is that
[40:24.320 --> 40:28.880]  most of the subjects were kind of like, you know, you're talking to people about UFOs,
[40:28.880 --> 40:31.840]  you're talking to people about the Bigfoot, you're hoping that you're going to get some
[40:31.840 --> 40:32.840]  real information.
[40:32.840 --> 40:33.840]  Oh yeah.
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.800]  The reality is we start digging into how a lot of these folks think.
[40:38.800 --> 40:44.400]  They have this exorbitant need to give you that those things are true, whether it's UFOs
[40:44.400 --> 40:45.400]  or Bigfoot.
[40:45.400 --> 40:47.400]  And there's not a lot of critical thinking.
[40:47.400 --> 40:51.760]  No, no, I agree, but the media only lets you have shows where you cover Bigfoot and
[40:51.760 --> 40:52.760]  Supercoppers.
[40:52.760 --> 40:54.040]  They offered me some shows like that.
[40:54.040 --> 40:57.520]  I was on Ventura's show for a while, and it went into that the third season, so they
[40:57.520 --> 40:58.520]  basically canceled it.
[40:58.520 --> 41:00.080]  So I think that's more of a corporate thing.
[41:00.080 --> 41:01.080]  But listen, I agree with you.
[41:01.080 --> 41:05.720]  A lot of the so-called conspiracy culture is BS stuff on purpose, and most of the Chemtrail
[41:05.720 --> 41:11.000]  stuff is bull, it's ice crystals, but there are real government programs to geo-engineer
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.200]  and manipulate the weather.
[41:12.200 --> 41:13.440]  I think you're probably right.
[41:13.440 --> 41:14.920]  I don't doubt that.
[41:14.920 --> 41:16.440]  That's not what I doubted at all.
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.600]  No, I know just what particular people are saying.
[41:18.600 --> 41:22.000]  This is the real issue when people are looking at Southwest flights, they're going back and
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.360]  forth over Burbank Airport or any airport, and they look at them, and they think something
[41:27.360 --> 41:28.360]  is going on.
[41:28.360 --> 41:30.360]  They think that they're getting sprayed.
[41:30.360 --> 41:32.800]  They think that the government is spraying them.
[41:32.800 --> 41:33.800]  But the reality?
[41:33.800 --> 41:34.800]  I think the NSA is watching them.
[41:34.800 --> 41:41.600]  But what they need to understand is the reality is, no, it's not like a spray that's in the
[41:41.600 --> 41:42.600]  air.
[41:42.600 --> 41:48.880]  But what's going on is it's jet fuel that's burning in the air after 9-11 when they stopped
[41:48.880 --> 41:49.880]  flights.
[41:49.880 --> 41:53.920]  There was this change in the Earth's temperature because of all the...
[41:53.920 --> 41:54.920]  Oh, yeah.
[41:54.920 --> 41:55.920]  I remember something.
[41:55.920 --> 41:56.920]  It was madness.
[41:56.920 --> 42:01.080]  The United States temperature changed in a measurable way because there was no flight.
[42:01.080 --> 42:04.640]  Because of the artificial clouds that are created, they do alter the temperature.
[42:04.640 --> 42:09.000]  But what people should be really concerned with is the instances of disease, of lung
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.320]  disease, and people have to live near airports.
[42:11.320 --> 42:12.320]  Oh, it's incredible.
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.600]  Dude, it's not good at all, like living here in an airport is terrible for you.
[42:16.600 --> 42:17.600]  That's the real country.
[42:17.600 --> 42:19.600]  The real country is the fuel.
[42:19.600 --> 42:22.200]  Yeah, it's not that they're spraying stuff in the sky.
[42:22.200 --> 42:23.800]  Well, a lot of them don't like to land heavy.
[42:23.800 --> 42:25.840]  The big secret is they start dumping fuels.
[42:25.840 --> 42:26.840]  You know that?
[42:26.840 --> 42:27.840]  Yeah.
[42:27.840 --> 42:28.840]  It is crazy.
[42:28.840 --> 42:36.600]  I mean, there have been all sorts of theories about geoengineering, about how to accomplish
[42:36.600 --> 42:37.600]  it.
[42:37.600 --> 42:40.800]  There's been all sorts of discussion about what to do with the hole in the ozone layer.
[42:40.800 --> 42:41.800]  It's bigger.
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.920]  Many, many scientists have come up with what they think are theories or partial solutions
[42:45.920 --> 42:48.200]  or ideas for future concepts.
[42:48.200 --> 42:52.560]  It could be a solution someday when technology reaches that certain point.
[42:52.560 --> 42:53.560]  Space mirrors.
[42:53.560 --> 42:54.560]  There we go.
[42:54.560 --> 42:55.560]  To think that...
[42:55.560 --> 42:58.960]  You know, to think that they have it would be silly, like, why wouldn't they think about
[42:58.960 --> 42:59.960]  those things?
[42:59.960 --> 43:03.560]  Why wouldn't they study those things?
[43:03.560 --> 43:12.280]  Bego, of course, Lord of the Rings, Bego Mortensen of so many huge films.
[43:12.280 --> 43:13.360]  I am a giant fan.
[43:13.360 --> 43:14.800]  My wife is a huge fan.
[43:14.800 --> 43:18.840]  Everybody I know is a huge fan, and he joins us.
[43:18.840 --> 43:23.720]  The NSA, what do you make of the fact that just a few years ago, people would say, oh,
[43:23.720 --> 43:27.960]  it's a conspiracy theory that they're listening to us, and now we learn they're targeting
[43:27.960 --> 43:29.840]  political dissidents.
[43:29.840 --> 43:32.320]  Aaron Schwartz was being harassed.
[43:32.320 --> 43:35.760]  We're learning that they're using the IRS against political groups.
[43:35.760 --> 43:40.560]  Do you think there's an awakening happening, or do you think that now the system just doesn't
[43:40.560 --> 43:43.280]  care if we know that we're slaves, basically, Bego?
[43:43.280 --> 43:47.880]  I think that there is an awakening, because all these things are being talked about right
[43:47.880 --> 43:54.640]  now, today, but people have very short attention spans nowadays.
[43:54.640 --> 44:02.560]  The more gadgets we have, the more phones and apps, and you started with the onslaught
[44:02.560 --> 44:07.760]  of cable, TV, playback, LAN, and then the internet, and the more access we have, you
[44:07.760 --> 44:10.440]  would think the more informed we're going to be, and the more connected we're going
[44:10.440 --> 44:15.240]  to be with each other, but people tend to go to the information that the courts would
[44:15.240 --> 44:24.120]  already believe, and so people seem to get more disunited and more united, unfortunately.
[44:24.120 --> 44:31.920]  When I say short attention span, yeah, the whole stuff about the NSA, or about the IRS,
[44:31.920 --> 44:34.520]  about the drone strikes, I mean, how much are they talking about drone strikes right
[44:34.520 --> 44:35.520]  now?
[44:35.520 --> 44:40.560]  Not really at all, but like another fan that just went away, and I'm in the cycle, and
[44:40.560 --> 44:47.320]  I think the problem is, and I think the politicians count on this, is that people can be, you
[44:47.320 --> 44:48.320]  know, swayed.
[44:48.320 --> 44:52.680]  It's like, here's a piece of cheese, all of this piece of cheese, go over there, it
[44:52.680 --> 44:55.560]  just left a while while I take care of this other business.
[44:55.560 --> 45:00.080]  The problem with Obama, and I support a lot of things about him, I think he's a very intelligent
[45:00.080 --> 45:01.080]  man.
[45:01.080 --> 45:08.240]  I supported him more times, there wasn't much of another option, obviously, but the thing
[45:08.240 --> 45:12.360]  is that the people that he appointed right at the start, at the beginning of 2009, I
[45:12.360 --> 45:18.520]  think we announced that we're going to be part of fixing the economic disaster that
[45:18.520 --> 45:23.120]  pushed left, were the same people that caused the problem on Wall Street, for example.
[45:23.120 --> 45:25.320]  So I didn't expect much there.
[45:25.320 --> 45:33.240]  His behavior in foreign policy, whether it be Iraq, Guantanamo, Afghanistan, you know,
[45:33.240 --> 45:36.040]  people still think that Afghanistan is a good war.
[45:36.040 --> 45:41.840]  It's not any more of a good war than Iraq, what, it's not any more of a sensible use
[45:41.840 --> 45:49.160]  of our resources and our, you know, young people's lives, and, and, and the, even the
[45:49.160 --> 45:50.160]  murder, not conventionally.
[45:50.160 --> 45:51.160]  Sure.
[45:51.160 --> 45:56.040]  What about Obama getting a peace prize, and then now putting al-Qaeda in Syria?
[45:56.040 --> 45:57.040]  That's ridiculous.
[45:57.040 --> 46:06.400]  I mean, his, I, unfortunately, Obama's government has not really been much different than Bush's
[46:06.400 --> 46:09.760]  in a lot of areas, and not just in foreign policy.
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.880]  Foreign policy is the most egregious, you know, like if we go into, if we go into Syria now
[46:14.880 --> 46:21.800]  to try to help get rid of Assad, people in the Arab world aren't going to say, oh, isn't
[46:21.800 --> 46:22.800]  that great?
[46:22.800 --> 46:23.800]  You're just doing something good.
[46:23.800 --> 46:28.120]  But the way they have seen the United States, the way they judge the United States is based
[46:28.120 --> 46:35.640]  on how they behave in the Israel-Palestine situation, the way they have behaved in 1948.
[46:35.640 --> 46:41.000]  And every single president, including Obama, has given special treatment to Israel, and
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.760]  that's obvious to Arab people.
[46:42.760 --> 46:47.680]  So it's going to be hard for us to be considered the good guys, which is something that our
[46:47.680 --> 46:52.000]  government, and I think our people, and we all want people to like us and think, oh, we're
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.240]  the good guys, we're the guys from World War II.
[46:54.240 --> 47:00.000]  They handed out candy bars on the streets of Paris and Rome, you know, we're the guys
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.560]  with the Marshall Plan.
[47:01.560 --> 47:03.560]  People don't see us that way, unfortunately.
[47:03.560 --> 47:05.840]  We're basically as the bullies.
[47:05.840 --> 47:11.360]  It's not these Americans who are any nicer or less nice than other people in the world.
[47:11.360 --> 47:12.360]  We're just people.
[47:12.360 --> 47:19.000]  But our government, which represents us, has not been a good player, very rarely has been
[47:19.000 --> 47:20.400]  a good player overseas.
[47:20.400 --> 47:23.680]  Vigo Mortensen is our guest.
[47:23.680 --> 47:30.920]  Going back to the NSA here, Peter King, Dick Cheney, others have called for his arrest.
[47:30.920 --> 47:34.720]  There's been news in the Daily Mail where they're talking about killing him.
[47:34.720 --> 47:39.880]  I think that Snowden is a hero leaking the NSA info.
[47:39.880 --> 47:44.960]  Vigo Mortensen, what would you like to say on that subject?
[47:44.960 --> 47:47.800]  I think he's definitely a very brave person.
[47:47.800 --> 47:56.000]  I also think it's ironic that all the Bush team, you know, attack Obama and Ernest Obama
[47:56.000 --> 48:01.640]  for doing exactly the same thing they were doing, you know, I mean, it's pretty hypocritical
[48:01.640 --> 48:02.640]  that behavior.
[48:02.640 --> 48:09.720]  I want to, I know this seems like, you know, a small thing, but it starts locally, you
[48:09.720 --> 48:10.720]  know, activism.
[48:10.720 --> 48:11.720]  Oh, I agree.
[48:11.720 --> 48:20.080]  I agree, the road touched me like no other film I've ever seen.
[48:20.080 --> 48:24.920]  And because I've studied history and things and had some experiences, it's so real.
[48:24.920 --> 48:29.720]  And I know within 10 days, most people become cannibals in Pentagon studies.
[48:29.720 --> 48:38.920]  In closing, that's a film that I am physically afraid to watch again because of almost the
[48:38.920 --> 48:43.200]  ancestral fears that it rises and what if there's a nuclear war?
[48:43.200 --> 48:44.360]  What of our atmosphere?
[48:44.360 --> 48:48.200]  What if, what if the road, what can you say about that?
[48:48.200 --> 48:54.080]  Well, it's true that the harrowing experience to watch it, but it's also beautifully made
[48:54.080 --> 49:01.120]  and John has directed that movie and John did a great job with a tough subject matter.
[49:01.120 --> 49:07.400]  And the boy in it, Cody Smith, he was now, he's over six feet tall, he's a man now, but
[49:07.400 --> 49:10.120]  he was, he was fantastic in that, in that movie.
[49:10.120 --> 49:14.880]  And it's unfortunate that in the last minute, that's not to distribute it as widely as they
[49:14.880 --> 49:15.880]  were going to.
[49:15.880 --> 49:22.000]  But like I said, good work eventually gets seen and a lot of people on the street, as
[49:22.000 --> 49:28.640]  many people comment on that movie as they do any other movie, they really, really touch
[49:28.640 --> 49:29.640]  the nerve.
[49:29.640 --> 49:35.080]  And it's kind of like you say, it's, it's a good warning in a way, like if we don't
[49:35.080 --> 49:37.680]  want to have to be that way, you got to take an action.
[49:37.680 --> 49:45.120]  Well, the most touching part is in closing is when Robert DeVall, you and your son are
[49:45.120 --> 49:51.160]  there, and he explains that boy's a God in this ugly destroyed world.
[49:51.160 --> 49:55.200]  He doesn't say that, but that's what I got in the poetry of it is that this youth, this
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.920]  energy, the creativity, the green shoots in a dead world.
[49:59.920 --> 50:05.880]  Children are our future, and I mean, what did you take away by that writing?
[50:05.880 --> 50:07.360]  Yes, beautiful.
[50:07.360 --> 50:14.560]  I mean, I would paraphrase in the way of what he was saying, or how I would put it is children
[50:14.560 --> 50:20.720]  are God, pay attention, that doesn't mean for your kid, or it doesn't mean you're talking
[50:20.720 --> 50:24.840]  simply about the kids, but remember what you felt when you were a kid.
[50:24.840 --> 50:30.000]  Remember your creative instincts, remember your instincts for peace, remember your instincts
[50:30.000 --> 50:37.120]  for fellowship, and for making something beautiful out of life, not destroying the world and
[50:37.120 --> 50:42.560]  not destroying the lives of others, you know, as adults often do, unfortunately.
[50:42.560 --> 50:48.120]  So remember, kid, remember yourself as a kid, and you're going to be on the right track.
[50:48.120 --> 50:52.360]  Well, Vigo Mortensen, you are a beautiful person, and I hope to meet you someday in person.
[50:52.360 --> 50:55.840]  God bless you for sharing your time with us, and for trying to help humanity, you're an
[50:55.840 --> 50:58.920]  example to us all, and I look forward to speaking to you again.
[50:58.920 --> 51:01.120]  Thank you very much, Vigo.

[54:32.680 --> 54:37.560]  Back in college when Beavis and Butthead was airing, I could have never imagined that
[54:37.560 --> 54:43.600]  the guy that created King of the Hill, idiocracy, extract, office space, Beavis and Butthead,
[54:43.600 --> 54:48.680]  the list goes on and on, it's current hit show, Silicon Valley on HBO, that I would
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.320]  be friends with Mike Judge and I'd go out and shoot his ranch with him and hang out
[54:52.320 --> 54:53.320]  and stuff.
[54:53.320 --> 54:57.880]  He's an amazing musician and that he would be a patriot who was aware of the New World
[54:57.880 --> 55:03.400]  Order or that some of me went into Hank Hill when he was writing that character, watching

[55:13.900 --> 55:20.080]  But the issue is even someone as powerful as Mike Judge in Hollywood is scared of the
[55:20.080 --> 55:25.800]  system and had the courage to talk about the fact that he didn't want to really criticize
[55:25.800 --> 55:27.520]  the New World Order because they might come after him.
[55:27.520 --> 55:35.400]  But he went ahead in this interview, the interview with Heston was back in 2001, David Rothschild
[55:35.400 --> 55:43.240]  was back in 2007, interview with Joe Rogan was 2014, Viggo Mortensen was this year as
[55:43.240 --> 55:44.240]  well.
[55:44.240 --> 55:49.200]  The interview with Mike Judge was back in May of 2013 at his house.
[55:49.200 --> 55:53.520]  That is coming up at the start of the next hour.
[55:53.520 --> 55:59.160]  And then we're going to have a rowdy, rowdy Piper and Sean Stone on a really powerful
[55:59.160 --> 56:00.160]  interview.
[56:00.160 --> 56:04.160]  We've got excerpts of Willie Nelson and Russell Brandt.
[56:04.160 --> 56:07.800]  And again, Russell Brandt said on the air that my show helped kind of change his world
[56:07.800 --> 56:09.000]  view and wake him up some.
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.320]  Doesn't mean Russell Brandt and I agree on everything, but he's an interesting guy that
[56:13.320 --> 56:18.000]  wants to empower humanity and we've interviewed him here in Austin for the TV show and gone
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.280]  out and interviewed him, but also via the phone.
[56:20.280 --> 56:24.400]  And so we've got some excerpts of that coming up.
[56:24.400 --> 56:27.160]  And when you talk to a Willie Nelson who I got to be friends with, he lives here in
[56:27.160 --> 56:33.400]  Austin or a rowdy, rowdy Piper or Sean Stone or Mike Judge or Joe Rogan or Viggo Mortensen
[56:33.400 --> 56:36.520]  or Charlton Heston, there's only one person here that doesn't like us.
[56:36.520 --> 56:44.040]  That's David Rothschild, who says Polterbeers can't swim basically and says that the says
[56:44.040 --> 56:48.920]  that the Mars is closer to the sun than the earth, and he just called me a conspiracy
[56:48.920 --> 56:49.920]  theorist, so it must be true.
[56:49.920 --> 56:55.560]  It doesn't matter that it's Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and then so on because he is the
[56:55.560 --> 57:00.160]  heir of the Rothschild fortune and what he says goes and if he's got a children book
[57:00.160 --> 57:06.240]  with, you know, grounding penguins or Polterbeers on the cover, then it's okay, but I just want
[57:06.240 --> 57:09.800]  to point out that it's safe for him to run around and say that because nobody's trying
[57:09.800 --> 57:12.000]  to shut down his free speech.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  So many times when I criticize one of these globalists, they say, oh, you're attacking
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  my free speech.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.520]  No, that would be if I tried to shut you up.
[57:18.520 --> 57:24.840]  Disagreeing with you is my free speech, but I appreciate Mike Judge having the courage
[57:24.840 --> 57:28.840]  to talk to us and he says this is one of his favorite interviews he's ever done, so that
[57:28.840 --> 57:30.440]  is coming up.
[57:30.440 --> 57:35.160]  Before we go to break here, we do not take money from you at gunpoint like the IRS for
[57:35.160 --> 57:40.760]  the fellow reserve and we don't give it to MPR and stimulus money or to MSNBC.

[57:52.480 --> 57:55.320]  have the New Year's resolution pack challenge.

[58:22.520 --> 58:23.520]  so.
[58:23.520 --> 58:24.520]  What will the response be in the next month?

[58:28.040 --> 58:29.040]  broadcast.

[59:05.160 --> 59:10.840]  get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible, prime director, discredit
[59:10.840 --> 59:11.840]  Alex Jones.
[59:11.840 --> 59:16.960]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory, a popular conspiracy theory talk show called
[59:16.960 --> 59:17.960]  info wars.
[59:17.960 --> 59:20.080]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[59:20.080 --> 59:25.480]  These people are assaulting us, targeting of patriots engaged, they are never going
[59:25.480 --> 59:32.480]  to stop, they are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[59:45.680 --> 59:53.200]  intellectually it's begun, you can fail it.
[59:53.200 --> 01:00:08.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.440]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:23.040]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.200]  We've got Mike Judge, Roddy Roddy Piper and Sean Stone, Willie Nelson, Russell Brandon,
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:33.000]  Moore in this hour, Daniel Salente joins us.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.640]  I am not coming to you live, I take this on almost a Christmas Eve, hard to believe Christmas
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.520]  2014 is gone on New Year's Eve and I appreciate the crew staying up here late to help us get
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.440]  this done and put together this special looking back.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.120]  We've never really done this, aired, reared interviews we did with famous people, we're
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.920]  also going to re-air interviews coming up in the next few months and we take off here
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.320]  and there with just some of the most powerful news breaking interviews, not so much with
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.920]  celebrities.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:04.880]  But all these celebrities stick their neck out coming on the broadcast to speak out against
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.880]  the system.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.560]  Here there's supposed to be a democrat, a communist, a socialist or maybe a few token
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.560]  conservatives.
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.360]  But if you speak out against the whole system as a fraud construct, they come after you.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.720]  So that's why I'm making a big deal out of that because it is a big deal.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:24.400]  Before I go any further, a Sony hackers threaten the US news media organization, the hackers
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.320]  who infiltrated Sony Pictures, I thought it was Kim Jong-un, they're going to have an
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:37.160]  airdrop of the interview, supposedly some NGO, CIA connected group of DVDs over North
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:42.080]  Korea and almost no one has DVD players or even VHS players, they live in dirt floor
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.840]  shacks and work as slaves for a little potbellied demon creature.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:52.040]  So all of you that love big government should love North Korea, but what a stunt.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.040]  Well now they admit it wasn't North Korea, that was all a hoax.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:00.180]  Well the hackers who infiltrated Sony Pictures Entertainment Computer's servers have threatened
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:04.200]  to attack an American news media organization according to the FBI bulletin obtained by
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.840]  the intercept.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.840]  But wait a minute, I thought the FBI said it was North Korea, well first they said it
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.760]  was an inside job, I think that's really what's going on.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:19.640]  The threat against the unnamed news organization by the Guardians of Peace, the hacker group
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:23.600]  that has claimed credit with a Sony attack, may extend to other organizations in the future.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.800]  Well don't worry, they're reintroducing the cyber security act to take over internet
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.840]  freedom next year to protect us and they got some zit-faced teenagers that actually think
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.320]  they're getting credit for everything and I'm sure they're doing some of it and I'm
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.920]  not attacking them, a lot of hackers have helped us, most hackers are white hats.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:47.280]  Hell we've had Captain Crunch on, let's get Captain Crunch on Friday, tomorrow, to talk
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.760]  about all the hacking stuff.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:56.280]  Referring to Sony only as USERPR-1, a news organization as USERPR-2, the joint intelligence
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:02.360]  bulletin dated December 24th and marked for official use only, says its purpose is to
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:09.440]  provide information on the late November 2014 cyber intrusion target USERPR-1 and related
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.160]  threats concerning the planned release of the movie, the interview, additionally these
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.480]  threats have extended to USERPR-2, a news organization, and may extend to other such
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:19.320]  organizations in the near future.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.320]  Oh my gosh, and so many times hacks turn out to be fake with fake info inserted, this
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:30.520]  just reeks of Sony and reeks of the White House and reeks, reeks, reeks.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:38.640]  Holiday horror, mom fatally shot by two-year-old in Walmart, there's the answer, secure firearms
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:45.080]  from children, so that's just some of the stuff that's always bubbling around sadly
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:53.440]  out there, Feds are now warning of more leaks, ABC News, threats to media from Sony hackers,
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.280]  this is a way to just make it sound more ominous and scary, so that somebody just getting a
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.320]  movie early or getting an after it comes out and putting it on the internet, it's about,
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:07.400]  not just about mainstream media and the big movie houses stopping piracy, it's about them
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:12.200]  bringing in a surveillance tearing to shut down film competition, music competition that
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.440]  they don't own or control.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.000]  Federal authorities predict even more private, potential embarrassing information from inside
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.560]  Sony Pictures can be made public now that the movie company has released its controversial
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.440]  film, the interview and news outlets concerning the story should become the next victim of
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:33.440]  a major cyber attack, so again there's ABC News also reporting on that front, some of
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:41.400]  the news from infowars.com, fake feminist post hateful tweets after actress says she loves
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:47.320]  serving her husband, well I mean I love serving each other, I mean you serve your woman, I
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.680]  mean you serve your man, that's what it's all about, you know male birds bring worms
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:57.240]  to females, TV house reported to police for hate crimes, we're asking why a fat person
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.360]  is fat, stay with us.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:08.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road, but if the
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.880]  unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:22.360]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans, they so pride
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:31.600]  in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit, they put a diamond gusset in the

[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.760]  others don't.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.920]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:09.560]  has been told not to drink the water, Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency, did
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:15.760]  you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.760]  day?
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:22.560]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:27.000]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  was.

[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.400]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape and the truth is it's hard
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:09.720]  even with diet and exercise because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:14.280]  bodies more than ever before, working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:18.840]  that super high quality nutraceuticals in addition to my diet and exercise were the
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.120]  answers that synergistically worked, I could see the drastic changes every day with the
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.720]  amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina and more of a twinkle in my eye.

[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.520]  I am your host Alex Jones, thank you for joining us on this tape transmission, but it is 2015
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:24.880]  as this goes out worldwide, I'll be back tomorrow Lord willing, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central live
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:31.720]  and then of course back on the Sunday transmission live, 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time, want
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.200]  to say great job the crew and 2014 all of our affiliate sponsors, listeners and the
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.200]  good Lord above.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:51.000]  Here's our interview or part of it with Mike judge, I have a hard time saying I'm either
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.120]  a Democrat or a Republican, it just doesn't feel good, I was definitely raised, my parents
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:04.280]  were very liberal, then I don't know certain things started to, I mean for a lot of people
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:10.720]  that's kind of almost a religion to them and right wing stuff is too, so I try to not
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.800]  be part of any of that.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:24.960]  I suppose I've become interested in smaller government kind of thinking, that sort of
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:31.840]  happens when you know, I think when you build your own thing, when you do your own thing
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:38.200]  and then suddenly you're getting penalized left and right, you know that kind of can
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.200]  change you.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:47.840]  If you got a business, you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:53.920]  I don't ever want to be one of those people that uses my whatever fame or whatever level
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:10:00.040]  of that notoriety I have from what I do in comedy to try to go into politics, I'm just
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.960]  like, I don't feel like I'm qualified, it kind of bugs me when people in Hollywood
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:11.880]  will use that, you know, their audience that they've gained through that to try to put
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:18.720]  out a political message and they have no idea what they're talking about.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:24.880]  Thing of the Hill, Hank was definitely, you know, I saw a sort of, I don't know, populist
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:31.720]  kind of like, you know, a guy who's like just trying to do his thing and just all these
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.880]  government and all these other weird things of the modern world, that was always the fun
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:42.720]  of it is just all these things just kind of poking at him, you know.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.320]  I live in the real world where men sell propane and propane accessories.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:56.240]  I definitely, I remember popping in a VHS when Alex Jones was on Cable Access, it was
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.880]  you and two other guys and somewhere I can't find it anymore, but I think I labeled the
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:07.600]  tape Three Dales, you were kind of the more rational one and the other two guys were just
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:14.440]  like, I don't know, I wish I could find that tape but King of the Hill started with a drawing
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.880]  of the four guys that I'd done, I was kind of like dabbling and doing panel cartoons
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.640]  which I never really did at all, I started, I went straight into animation, I didn't draw
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:29.000]  comic books or anything and so I had the four guys and Dale, I just something about the
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.880]  way he looked, originally I had his hat say Smith and Wesson, the first drawing I ever
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:38.840]  did, I just put that on there, I don't know why, just the way he looked and I'd done a
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:43.800]  first draft of the pilot and then Greg Daniels got involved and at some point, you know,
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:50.800]  we had this thing where his wife is, you know, getting it on with this Native American healer
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:58.280]  and clearly his kid's not his but so we had this idea about that he's just, you know,
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.600]  it's almost probably a subconscious thing, he's like, he's into every conspiracy except
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.280]  the one that's going on in his own house.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.440]  Nice work John Redcorn, she didn't suspect a thing.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.760]  It's almost like his escape, you know, or something, I mean, I never psychoanalyzed it
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.760]  that much but I kind of feel like that's what that character was about so he was almost
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:23.440]  like looking for conspiracies, you know, kind of, and some of them might have something
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.440]  to them, some of them are crazy.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:30.760]  I have read a book, now who do you believe, me or Hank?
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.560]  I know Hank, Hank more believable.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:40.440]  Phil is kind of one of the ones that, you know, probably gives you guys a bad name.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:47.200]  Johnny Hardwick who does The Voice, I don't know, you may even know him, he had a few
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.920]  kooky theories of his own and sometimes we would work those in, I mean, there's one line,
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:56.200]  he said that, he's talking about something and it ended with him saying something that
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.920]  they're doing and corn is next.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.480]  A French study that was just released finds a rat that are fed genetically engineered
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:08.400]  corn suffered from tumors and severe organ damage.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.520]  This is the first study that's looking at the effects on rats of eating genetically modified
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.360]  foods over their lifetimes.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.720]  They gave the rats the genetically modified corn, they gave them the genetically modified
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.280]  corn with the herbicide that the corn is used with.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:29.000]  You know, I grew up very liberal parents, like thinking gun control is the way to go,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.480]  you know, that Michael Moore movie, the bowling for calm, calm one, kind of actually made
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.360]  me go the other, made me think like, I mean, he's not trying to, that's not the effect
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:48.000]  he wanted, I don't think, but he's like kind of, that movie kind of makes you think, no
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.320]  gun control is a bad idea.
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.480]  I mean, to me, if you look at it like, I don't think that's what he's trying to do at all,
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.160]  but like he mentions Canada in there and he says, you know, there's lower crime there
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:02.560]  and same people in guns, I don't know, I own guns.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.400]  It's, I think if you look at it statistically, you actually are safer.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:13.800]  I got me a couple AKs, some sawed-offs, 25, 9mm and a couple of ground to airs.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:21.240]  I got a fort up in the hills, virtually impenetrable and enough supplies to outlast a 30-year standoff.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:28.680]  I know this because, okay, so 1993, Beavis and Butted, the series came out and gun crimes
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.920]  have gone down since Beavis and Butted came out.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:38.400]  What's interesting is that nobody talks about, no one wants statistics, I actually went to,
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.440]  I actually took graduate probability and statistics classes, that was, I was going to become a
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:48.360]  math teacher before all this Beavis stuff happened, but when I was getting blamed for
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:54.920]  all this like downfall of youth, that whole time crime was going down in almost every
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.760]  category from the time, I mean, if you really wanted to make a correlation, you could say
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.200]  Beavis and Butted is saving the world, but that's stupid.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:07.840]  That really doesn't make any sense, but it makes more sense than saying this particular
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.640]  thing happened and this particular thing happened, you know, but really like statistically,
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:18.640]  there's no correlation.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:28.320]  Yeah, there's that map where it's just like almost county by county, where gun control,
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:32.720]  it's not doing any good, it's like, there's higher crime rates where there's gun control,
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.160]  lower where there isn't, I mean, it's just like county by county.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.480]  I mean, you can't, I think because I have this science background, I just, you look
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:44.600]  at that joke, you know, that's, it's kind of ridiculous.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:49.160]  As much as, you know, those bumper stickers might have been run into the ground, I mean,
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:54.640]  it's true, it's like, I would be all for it if it was effective, but it's, I haven't
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.880]  seen anything that shows it's effective, you know.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.680]  Well, Mao said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.520]  What does Hank Hill say about disarming people?
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:11.520]  It is the right of all Americans as cotton has taught me to own a gun.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.960]  Even though I'm not so good at shooting them, the Japanese machine gun blew my shins off
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.360]  in WW2.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.040]  I loved it.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.320]  It's good to see somebody yelling at Pierce Morgan.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.680]  You excuse me of attacking the second amendment of the Constitution.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:33.320]  I want to get people off pills that the insert says that they commit suicide and kill people.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:38.920]  I want to blow the real culprit, suicide pills, mass murder pills.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.720]  Okay, let me ask you one question.
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:46.520]  It was interesting though, the, the, the way it seemed to be spun on all these websites.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:52.320]  There's all these websites now that have a bunch of hipsters on them who will just kind
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.320]  of like, kind of play a clip and grin and chuckle about it.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.320]  And that's how I saw it.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.320]  I can't remember what it was on.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.320]  I was thinking, hey, right on, Alex, go for it.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.320]  Well, everything you were saying was true too.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.320]  I mean, the, the clip that I saw, because you, yeah, you were talking about, yeah.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.320]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.320]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.320]  Mao took the guns.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.320]  Fidel.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:18.320]  And if you try to take our guns, 1776 will commence again.
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:23.320]  If you try to take our firearms, doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:27.080]  street, begging for them to have their guns taken, we will not relinquish them.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.880]  Do you understand?
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:30.880]  Something like that.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.420]  You know, I used to do you really well.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:37.760]  I can't, like, it was the, how was the water filter commercial you used to do?
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.760]  Or would it, the, it's been, it's been a while.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.960]  You think I'd have it down now though.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:47.280]  It was just like hanging out with you last night.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:55.240]  Look at these headlines, IRS targeted tea party groups for scrutiny, searching words
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.680]  like patriot, tea party.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.200]  That does scare me.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:03.760]  I think I'm just going to make sure to not use the words tea party or constitution in
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.760]  any of my work.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760]  Pretty evil.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.760]  I won't.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760]  Yeah.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]  Yeah.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:16.360]  Well, it's, they're calling it the constitutional restrictions or whatever they referred to it
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.360]  as.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.360]  Yeah.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:24.720]  No, that was, that actually is scary that, yeah, that's going to make me listen to some
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.720]  more Alex Jones.
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.720]  Come on, I wanna see it.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.720]  I wanna see it.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.720]  Yeah.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.720]  Come on.
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:34.720]  Do it, do it.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:45.720]  Oh my God.
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:58.120]  Well, if I was to get, uh, heavy and deep on it, I think the one thing that's made me
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:03.840]  tick or makes me, I mean, other than just wanting to try to be funny, it tends to be,
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.240]  um, and I didn't, I don't overanalyze, but then, you know, when you do this long enough,
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.240]  you do analyze.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:17.240]  And I think what it is, is probably, I think a lot of us are just kind of out of sync with
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:22.200]  the way the world is right now, you know, like the way, the modern world, we're not,
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.120]  we're not prepared for it all the time, and there's a lot of stuff that's messed up about
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.120]  it.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.480]  And I think that's where a lot of my comedy comes from.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.960]  It's like things that, um, you know, anything from being stuck in a cubicle to being stuck
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.600]  in classrooms that you don't belong in, those kind of things.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.480]  I think that I get a lot of material out of that.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.480]  I got to get out of here.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.960]  I think I'm going to lose it.
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.960]  Uh-oh.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.200]  Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mounders.

[01:24:50.840 --> 01:25:14.320]  It is one of my favorite all time movies and it really gets you to think outside the box
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:20.800]  and of course I grew up watching them on television as well, it's super exciting to have Rowdy
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:27.600]  Roddy Piper on with us today from Los Angeles there in Sean Stone's living room, both guys
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.600]  are with us and it's great I've gotten to be good friends with Jesse Ventura, I know
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.600]  these two guys are friends as well or have been in the past and so now I get to talk
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:42.040]  to both of them and Mr. Piper, formerly of course a born Roderick George Tombs, it is
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.760]  great to have you on the World Wide Broadcast sir.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:50.560]  Would you mind just introducing me every place I go, it's a fantastic introduction.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:54.800]  Well it's great to have you on, I tell you so much is happening in the world but let's
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:26:00.200]  get into They Live, you've been in a lot of movies but what's your take on the 25th anniversary
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.280]  of They Live?
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:09.160]  The movie They Live when it was made was more about Reaganomics at the time but with the
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:15.480]  music lulls you to sleep, conspiracies, one of the things that the movie has done is it's
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:23.480]  taken on a life of its own, it never gets old as we see the world evolve and try to
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:30.080]  make us a little chip, the same things happening over and over again, you watch They Live and
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:34.920]  it gives you, it's kind of like the cliff notes for what's going on.
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:41.520]  John Carpenter, when we shot this scene with the homeless people, he actually used the
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:45.800]  homeless people there, John is a big activist and I give him all the respect in the world
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:52.920]  for that and turning out and showing what the world's become, I don't know why America
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:59.560]  has homeless people, it's terrible but also another thing we had to do was pay off the
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:07.400]  gang so they wouldn't come and wreck our trailer so there was little conspiracy, little gangs
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:14.400]  for warfare, then there would be the homeless people we take care of and it really became
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.520]  a venture of love to a certain point and trying to do the right thing.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.120]  Again I give all the credit to John on that.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:31.320]  My favorite part of the film, I think when the character Nada looks out and he says,
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:39.680]  I believe in America, I think that's probably the biggest statement of the entire movie.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:45.560]  There's one thing that can escape people if you don't have somebody personal to you that
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:52.040]  has been harmed by the conspiracies and all the tributaries that lead to that, I run off
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.040]  that.
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.400]  If you don't have someone close to you shaking at night time because you got blown up twice,
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:03.520]  went over again, got blown up two times, then it doesn't mean so much to you.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:09.240]  Every time we want to go to war, send your boy to war, my boy's already been there.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:14.320]  Hey, there's mind control going on, the signals broadcast 24 hours a day through all this
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.440]  media just become aware of it and they'll say there's nothing going on and I want to
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:24.160]  say put on these glasses or start Q and concrete.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.680]  There are sociopaths, there are people that's part of the population that have no emotion,
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.680]  they are not human and I think the human race that has not yet come to terms with the fact
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:38.720]  that there are 10% of the population that are sociopathic that do not have human emotion
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.960]  or boundaries and they are not human.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:46.160]  So when we say, hey, we'll give them a pass, he's human, hey, he made a mistake, we're
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.720]  not understanding that the fun events that they were talking about is a small percentage
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.800]  of the population that does not care about humanity.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:58.200]  Do you think the world is putting on the black sunglasses more and more?
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:04.040]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:09.720]  and kick ass and I'm all out of bubblegum.
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:17.240]  Trying to take a stand, boys, again, they, you need to stand up against they and I, yes,
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:23.400]  yes, the answer coming into that tunnel, it's like where the Illuminati have their meetings.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.120]  Anything that you know anything about those meetings?
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.560]  I know anything about them, I like to go in there and say hi to those guys.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:33.520]  Well Sean, I bet you know about those meetings.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.880]  I haven't been invited yet but I think it's time he and I do a movie and we'll go chew
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:39.240]  gum together and have some fun.
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.200]  Well folks, Rowdy, Sean, stay there, I'm going to say bye to you at the end of the show.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.600]  This has been an amazing interview.

[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:09.240]  Working with diet and exercise because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:13.520]  our bodies more than ever before. Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry,
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:18.520]  I found that super-high-quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise, were
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:22.800]  the answers and synergistically worked. I could see the drastic changes every day with

[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:16.200]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.760]  One of the fun parts about this job, trying to be a watchman on the wall as imperfect
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:27.120]  as I am, is that I have been contacted and reached out to you by so many amazing people.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.280]  And one of them is Willie Nelson. I've been to his house repeatedly, played chess with
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:35.760]  him, hung out, been around the bus, been to concerts. I met him one time when I was sitting
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:41.960]  there shining DVDs at Alamo Draft House on South Lamar in Austin. This has got to be
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:49.360]  like 2005 or something. This interview you're about to hear is from 2008. And Willie Nelson
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:53.960]  is like 81 years old. He's still pretty much there, but not like he was back then. Plus
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:58.240]  he smokes a lot of marijuana, but he's a great guy. Comes from the same area Texas my dad
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:03.680]  does. I just say that because there's a lot of Willie Nelson types out in the hills. He
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.640]  calls himself a hillbilly. And I guess I'm a little bit hillbilly. But all of a sudden
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:11.840]  walking around the counter to where I'm at, is Willie Nelson, he shakes my hand, buys
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:16.720]  an in-game DVD and says, give me your phone number. So I give him my phone number. And
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:23.720]  about six months later, my producer during the show would have my phone, people calling
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:28.280]  it. And he goes, yeah, it's Willie Nelson. He wants to talk to you during a break. And
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:32.880]  I get on and goes, hi, this is Willie. I really liked your film in-game. You know, we need
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.800]  to get together sometime, have a concert or something to wake people up about 9-11 and
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:43.080]  what's happened to this country. And again, Bush was a tyrant. Obama's been in many ways
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:47.200]  even worse. But the point is, is that Willie Nelson spoke out against Bush and his tyranny.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.880]  And he said that he's been, you know, displeased with some of the things Obama's done as well.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.240]  But it was just fun to get to know Willie Nelson. And then, then Tara came down a few
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.840]  times, we hung out with Nelson as well. It's just good to know these Mavericks, folks that
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:07.320]  are really different. And that our true bonafide originals and Willie Nelson is one of those.
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:12.120]  So here's an excerpt of one of many interviews I've done with Mr. Nelson and then Russell
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:16.680]  Brand, the big global firebrand comedian. The one that was married to Katy Perry. I
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:20.000]  learned that he and her both listen to the show. I've had Katy Perry's dad on. Just
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.840]  showing you how many people are awake to the New World Order. Here is Willie Nelson.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.640]  Mr. Nelson, thank you for joining us.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:30.400]  Oh, my pleasure. Alex, it's good to be on your show. I hope you're doing good.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:34.640]  Man, it's the best of times, the worst of times. Life's great. It's beautiful in Austin,
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.720]  Texas. We've got great people like Willie Nelson out there. I wanted to get you on to
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:43.720]  your take on Dennis Kasinich and impeachment and find out if you're supporting him and
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:44.720]  if so, why?
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:52.120]  Well, first of all, Dennis Kasinich is a great friend of mine and I've supported him ever
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:36:00.520]  since I'd known him. I've always admired the way that he stood up for the little guy and
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:07.640]  told it like it is. And to hell with the consequences, you've got to admire a man that has that kind
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:14.800]  of nerve. I wrote the song you just played a while ago, Whatever Happened to Peace on
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:21.000]  Earth. I wrote that for Dennis Kasinich's campaign. And it pretty much tells where we
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.880]  are today. Just how much is a human life worth? How much oil is a human life worth these
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.080]  days? There has to be a price tag on it or else we wouldn't be able to go around the
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:37.320]  world killing people overall. I love the way Dennis is handling the impeachment thing.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:46.440]  You know, I think he's got, what, 54 impeachment charges against George? And there's probably
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:50.200]  another 54 laying around out there if he wants to go get them.
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:54.640]  Absolutely. He first introduced 35 instead of Congress in an act he would add more and
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:00.760]  he has. He did pressure them, the Democratic Congress that was supposedly elected to punish
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:05.360]  Bush's crimes in the end of the war, now becoming very transparent there in the same military
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:13.720]  industrial complex hip pocket of those special interests. But he was able to get the Judiciary
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:19.760]  Committee to hear his charges coming up this Friday and I just wanted to put the call out
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:24.560]  for everybody to call the House Judiciary Committee and to call all of your members
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:29.840]  of Congress and tell them, look, it's admitted that the wiretapping of U.S. citizens without
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:35.760]  warrants, each counts a felony. It's admitted that lying about WMDs in Iraq and it's come
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:39.080]  out, we have the White House documents that they knew they were lying. Those are felonies.
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:45.920]  The main thing that bothers me is the fact that anyone in this country can get by with
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:52.680]  murder if they happen to be the President of the United States, have all of the government
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:57.960]  behind them. And I don't think that's right. I think if I get caught on the street smoking
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.960]  a joint, I'm going to jail.
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:04.840]  Of all the articles of impeachment, which ones do you think are most important?
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:10.120]  Well, I probably couldn't name the articles of impeachment by name, but I do know that
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:14.640]  it was wrong for him to go to war. I do know that a lot of our guys and gals have lost
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:20.080]  their lives and have been, lives have been ruined forever because of the law that he
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:29.440]  broke. And for that alone, he should have to pay for it in some way. Impeachment seems
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.560]  like a minor way. You know, the guy's going to be out of office in a while and I'm sure
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:38.640]  there's a lot of people going to follow him around and try to charge him with all kinds
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:43.680]  of things even after he leaves office. But the point that you brought out, the fact that
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:50.400]  we're so close to a war with Iran and that anything this guy does between now and election
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:55.440]  day could spark it, I think an impeachment hearing between now and then might slow the
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:01.160]  guy down. It might get the attention of the world and us on trying to stop a guy who's
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.760]  really intent on starting a war.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.640]  Well, you're right. And it also shows the world that we're serious about getting our
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:13.960]  name back. I mean, we've always been known not as being perfect, but as the good guys.
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:20.960]  And now we don't have to do that. We might, you know, in fact, I think we should set ourselves
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:26.520]  up as the world's peacemakers, not the world's war mongers. There is a place in the world
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.560]  for a peacemaker. We all know that.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:32.720]  Absolutely. So I think it's important for the world to see that the American people
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:35.880]  are at least attempting to see that justice is done.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:36.880]  Absolutely.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:42.800]  Now, you were right. That is the second article of impeachment is falsely systematically and
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:51.200]  with criminal intent, conflating the attacks of September 11th with a mispresentation of
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:56.800]  Iraq as a security threat as part of a fraudulent justification for the war of aggression. And
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.160]  we now have the memos, the White House memos and others where they knew Iraq had nothing
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:04.760]  to do with it. Of course, they knew that from day one, being the authors of the attacks
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:08.840]  of the 9-11 attacks, but that they were going to go out and sell the public on this. And
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:14.240]  now, conservatively, there's a million dead Iraqis because of this. I mean, this is, this
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:18.080]  is Nazi level, World War II level crimes.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:26.120]  No, this is, this is very, very serious. There's a lot of people dying today because of that
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.920]  huge law that he broke. And I know I don't think he should get by with it. I don't think
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:36.000]  any of those guys are in there. And he's not the only one. You know, he's just the puppet
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.600]  on the string. There's a lot of people telling him what to do and, you know, they're using
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:46.440]  small words and big letters so he can get it said. But there's people behind him telling
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.440]  him what to do.
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:53.000]  Would you like to see the New World Order puppeteers controlling the marionette to be brought to
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  justice as well, Willie?
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.600]  I think they have to. You just can't bring in the puppet. You've got to bring in the
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.720]  guys pulling the strings. Press wasn't perfect back in the 70s, back in 73, 74, but at least
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:09.200]  they did cover the investigation and the movement towards impeachment with Richard Nixon. I
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:13.640]  think that's the missing link here is that the media, you're seeing almost no coverage
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:17.400]  of what Congressman Kucinich and all of his co-sponsors are doing.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:22.800]  Well, yeah, that's, that's another problem that we have with is getting the message
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:29.400]  you cross because the media people seem to be happy just telling the other side. There's
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.000]  a, you know, they know that they'll get in trouble themselves. They'll lose their jobs
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.120]  if they start talking like you and I are doing.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:40.280]  You're shifting gears into the economy. You know, you've involved with Farm Aid and so
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:45.040]  much more aware of how this international banks, central banks operate. We've got the
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:50.280]  IMF and World Bank documents where they admit they are engineering the implosion in our
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:55.280]  economy so they can consolidate wealth and basically repossess America, come in and buy
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:01.120]  all of our companies, Anheuser-Busch, Real Estate, car companies. Willie Nelson, what's
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:03.440]  your take on that? What's happening right now with the economy?
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.800]  Well, I can see where they've done it with the farmers. So we used to have eight million
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:13.520]  small family farmers out there and through various techniques, illegal and whatever they
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:20.480]  have taken back over six million of those small family farms and they've done it by
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:24.200]  doing exactly what you said. They drop the prices on everything, putting farmers out
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:31.040]  of business all over the world just so they can pick up the land and use it to their advantage.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.760]  The big corporations want to do it all. They want to put all the small family farmers out
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:42.480]  of business and I still think that this whole thing, our entire economy, that agriculture
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:49.400]  is the bottom rung on our economic ladder and the farmer is our backbone of that economic
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:54.240]  ladder so we have to bring the farmer back to small family farmer. We have to start
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.160]  thinking locally, sustainable agriculture. Since you last came on the show and went
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:04.040]  public for 9-Eleven Truth, Jesse Ventura came on the show and then told me behind the scenes
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:08.040]  he goes, look, I want to come out for 9-Eleven Truth. You gave me films years ago when I
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.560]  was in Texas visiting with Willie Nelson and Kinky Friedman when I saw him in an event.
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:17.960]  He said, but now I've looked into it. It's an inside job. He went public and even Fox
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:22.000]  News had trouble attacking him. Now we've had the former Italian president who was also
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.760]  the head of intelligence go public, German defense ministers, leaders in the Japanese
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:32.040]  diet, their parliament. We've had actress of the year go public. I mean, it is just
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:38.280]  a mass of prominent people, CIA section chiefs going public. What is it like to see this
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.680]  type of courage, Willie?
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:46.840]  Well, it's great. We do know that there are some strong people in this country and around
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:51.920]  the world who will stand up for what's right and it's always gratifying to see a guy jump
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:58.280]  up and say what he thinks to stand up for what he believes is right. I can see more
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:03.440]  and more people doing that these days. It is very gratifying. When you look at it for
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.120]  what it is, it's no big deal. It's somebody did something wrong and somebody needs to
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:14.480]  be outed for it. And once you look at all the facts and see the pictures and hear all
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:22.240]  the stories, it doesn't take a German scientist to realize that we got hit by some inside
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.640]  people there. We need to find out who it is.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:29.560]  Willie, what has the response been like since you came on my radio show twice and then on,
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:34.160]  of course, free speech TV and Democracy Now and question the official fable? What has
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:38.720]  the response been like from your fans, from your supporters and your detractors?
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:47.720]  99% in favor of what we've been saying and 100% believing that we have the right to say
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:53.640]  it. There's nobody to say, hey, shut up.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.880]  Well, folks, I've wanted to get him on for a long time. Russell Brand, who is a comedian,
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:05.200]  best-selling author, actor, TV host, you name it, who has been popular for many years.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.880]  He's really a sensation now. The whole office today, when they found out he was coming on,
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:14.880]  got really excited. We have a lot of big guests on. Bottom line, what is front and center
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.640]  most important to you right now that's happening in the world?
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.880]  I think the thing that is most important to me is the thing I'm talking about in my show
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:28.280]  is the cultural narratives that we are told, the way that we are presented with information,
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:33.600]  the way that meaning is designated, the significance that is given to certain issues and not to
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:38.640]  others and the light in which stories are told. So I think that that could obviously
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:46.040]  comprise Edward Snowden or it could comprise Syria. It could comprise more broadly the
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:51.960]  manufacture of consent or the manipulation of the consciousness of civilization through
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:57.480]  a conglomeration of government, big business and media.
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:02.760]  Coming into this interview, we played a clip when you were on MSNBC and that really struck
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:06.800]  a chord with people when you just laughed at their narcissism and said, you don't talk
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:12.720]  about anything real. You're basically a bunch of peacocks up here. What was it like behind
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:20.160]  the scenes and it seemed like you were clashing with them and it really captured people's
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.840]  imagination. What happened there? Because you were in the middle of it.
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:29.560]  Well, I mean, it's quite typical when you go on those type of TV shows that there's
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:36.520]  a particular frequency or pitch to the interview. There's a normal manner of speaking, not
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:45.040]  only the type of topics that are discussed, but the kind of banal, slightly shrill tone
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:53.760]  that the information that is predicated on celebrity and gossip and what I would call
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:47:01.080]  low frequency data, low vibration information. It was like that when you go on anything on
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.400]  mainstream television, those programs all sound the same. People all look the same.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:09.680]  They all talk in the same way. It was that kind of atmosphere. The only difference was
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:15.880]  that the impoliteness was at such an extreme level that it gave me an opportunity to point
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:20.160]  out some of that stuff, which I wouldn't typically do because it sometimes doesn't seem appropriate
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:24.080]  to tell people that what they're doing is pointless or silly.
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.920]  Why do you think you shook them up so bad? I don't know. I'm a bit confused by it because
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.280]  I just went on there and did what I normally do is just be polite. And then if I point
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:37.680]  out something idiosyncratic or weird, I observe that. But don't you think, Alex, that sort
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:42.840]  of deal with so much duplicity, whether in a situation where you're in an interview on
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:48.520]  the TV or on the radio, or if you're making a purchase in a shop, sometimes we lose our
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:53.720]  authenticity, our ability to be human and truthful with one another. So I think if you
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:48:00.400]  interact in a very human and truthful way, then that can be very disruptive. It's not
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.120]  like there are certain individuals that are good and certain individuals that are bad.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:08.720]  I know myself, but I work in films and I've worked a lot in media, so I must be culpable
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:14.240]  as well for propagating these ideas and supporting them in my own way. And on a bad day, like
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:19.400]  just now, I arrived at Seattle Airport and there were people that wanted autographs and
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:24.920]  they were the kind of people that sell the photographs on afterwards. For eBay they don't
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:30.760]  want them for themselves, they want them to sell an eBay. I couldn't be bothered to sign
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.160]  it, I just didn't feel like doing it. But that's not the absolute best aspect of me
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:41.360]  as a person. The person I aspire to be will always sign everything for everyone. So I'm
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:48.280]  capable in myself of being selfish, egocentric and self-obsessed and self-centered, but I
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:53.800]  think it's more of a problem when you have a massive machine that conducts consciousness
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:49:00.280]  and orchestrates the way that we think en masse that has a set of priorities and an agenda
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:07.320]  that is making people in huge numbers think in a selfish, insular, atomized, apathetic
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:13.440]  and impotent way. Wow. Man, I tell you, you're on fire. It seems like you have really had
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.680]  an awakening. I mean, you've been awake for a long time, but it seems like your awakening
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:23.680]  is accelerating. Is that accurate to say? Yeah, I think you might be right as a man.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:31.040]  As a matter of fact, Alex, for me, spirituality is an important component. I meditate a lot
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:36.920]  and I practice certain spiritual principles that mean I have to be very mindful one day
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:41.960]  at a time about the way I live my life. I'm like a drug and alcohol-free. And the more
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:47.040]  that I've detached myself from the things I thought would make me happy, like money
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:54.720]  and fame and other people's opinions, the more truth is being revealed. That is pure
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:01.000]  veritas because that's been my experience as well. And what you were just talking about,
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.480]  just being aware that you're being selfish or doing things that are self-centered or
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:10.560]  narcissistic is half the battle. Most of the people out there, especially that are in the
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:15.440]  mainstream media, they are purely turned over to the narcissism and are like biological
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:20.800]  androids. They're not even real. And I think that's why you freak Brzezinski's daughter
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:26.600]  out and others so much is because they got into this conscious of the manipulation they
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:31.160]  were involved in. But really, what you do to others comes back on you. So now they've
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:36.680]  turned into what they tried to do to the public, making the public one-dimensional cutouts
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:40.120]  of what they projected. It's now blown back on them.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:45.600]  That's very interesting. I often wonder, Alex, how those situations are contrived. I suppose
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.840]  if you work in the media, you go through so many filters, you're just not going to get
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.440]  that kind of job unless you're a certain type of person, unless you know the right sort
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:57.680]  of people. If you say the wrong type of things, you'll be filtered out. So by the time you
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:01.680]  get to the point where you have your own show, generally speaking, do you think a certain
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:06.800]  way that is in alignment with the elitist interest behind whatever corporation owns
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:13.600]  the outlet? I think, too, that there is probably a less obvious way of understanding things
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:18.640]  in terms of, I wonder what happens neurologically. I wonder what the energy in a brain looks
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:23.960]  like. I wonder what that is like if our brains are surrounded by other brains that are thinking
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:30.200]  in a certain way, that are broadcasting, transmitting at a certain frequency. This is what I feel
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:35.960]  that we have is a situation where there's such a strong and hypnotic message that exists
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:40.960]  not just externally, but more worrying internally. I'm always more worried when I find myself,
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.880]  that's why I don't like it when I've transgressed my own personal principles because I think,
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:49.720]  well then, I'm not behaving in accordance with what I believe in. I'm policing myself.
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:54.760]  If I'm selfish, then I'm part of the problem. You know, like Gandhi said, be the change
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.760]  you want to see in the world.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:02.080]  From my own research, you're absolutely on target at the core here that the establishment
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:11.080]  is expert at hijacking icons or, as Campbell wrote, archetypes, archetypal images and then
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:18.240]  twisting them towards their aim and then really rewriting all the basic cultural knowledge
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:24.280]  that every group out there had and replacing it basically only with the New World Order's
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:30.320]  propaganda. I mean, nothing against basketball players or movie stars, but if that's what
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:35.720]  kids aspire to be, there's not many slots there, but by making those people the icons
[01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:40.520]  artificially and making that the only thing that matters, then kids will never think about
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:45.440]  being a revolutionary or never think about standing up non-violently to oppression or
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:50.920]  never think about the fact that they could change the course and be an example to others.
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:54.840]  And so I really get from this that you're trying to almost go back and see what these
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:59.320]  people really stood for and try to get folks to become aware of this power.
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:05.160]  Yes, exactly, Alice. I look at some corporate slogans like McDonald's, Lovin' It, which
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:10.400]  is kind of meaningless and empty and an exploitation of an interesting piece of language to do
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:16.560]  with love. I look at Diet Dr Pepper and their slogan, unbelievably satisfying and how ridiculous
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:21.560]  and hyperbolic that is. Even the slogan of Gillette Raisers, the best a man can get,
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:27.560]  I can immediately point out that this is setting the bar very, very low for humankind and for
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:33.560]  humankind. The kind of language used and slogans used by Malcolm X by any means necessary,
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:39.160]  Che Guevara, it's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees and Gandhi be the
[01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:44.160]  change that you want to see in the world. These messages are subjugated. Furthermore,
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:50.560]  these heroes I offer replaced gods and gods themselves are symbols of certain traits and
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:55.800]  ideas. Indigenous faith typically are pagan, which means they worship the earth and their
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:54:01.200]  environment. If you have a culture of people like the Celts that worship and revere rivers,
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:05.960]  how will you feel when corporations want to pollute your rivers? If you have an Indigenous
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:11.800]  faith like the Nordics who revere the noble oak tree, how will you feel about deforestation?
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:16.800]  If you have people like the native people of this country that revere and worship the
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:23.040]  earth and soil, how will you feel when people say that fracking is a good idea and necessary?
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:27.680]  It means that we've lost our narrative that ties us to our actual reality, our authentic
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:33.400]  reality as part of nature, not living separate from nature but part of nature. It gives us
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:36.680]  a narrative where we live in accordance with the interest.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:43.120]  Well, so they get us to sell out for light beer and blue jeans as they say in a recent
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.920]  popular film and then we're not satisfied by the light beer and blue jeans. Well, I
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:52.120]  should end closing because this happens to me a lot every time I finish an interview.
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:56.760]  After it ends, there's something or a group of things I wish that I would have said. Russell
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:01.240]  Brand, we really appreciate your time. In closing and a minute or two, any other key
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.360]  points that you'd like to put out there to the millions that will end up watching and
[01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:06.360]  listening to this?
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:10.240]  Well, Alex, I think probably you and me are coming at things from a sort of a different
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:15.920]  perspective. But me, I see like my views of sort of more informed by sort of socialism,
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:21.720]  even Marxism. But I think ultimately what we believe in is freedom and truth. And I
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:26.440]  think that as long as people respect each other's differences, then I think and also
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:30.360]  acknowledge that we, the people struggling against oppression have more in common with
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:34.200]  each other than we do than the people that control us. Then I think there's a chance
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.520]  for unity and change.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:42.160]  Sure. I mean, I think that at a level you can see as a counter to the centralized corporatist,
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:47.360]  communism, socialism, but then you realize that they selectively use the deployment of
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:53.240]  collectivism to only create a permanent peasant class to control us so that we never have
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:57.600]  come to libertarian view of the individual being empowered and having a giant middle
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:02.120]  class. I mean, what's your view of, say, libertarianism or Ron Paul? I mean, off air, you said
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:05.880]  that you were aware of my work. What's your what's your view for folks of what I do?
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:10.920]  Well, I think that you're fantastic because you're challenging authority and you're challenging
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:16.080]  state as close to I agree with you. But me, for me, the number one priority for anyone
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:21.640]  who wants social change has to be the welfare of those most in need of it. The support of
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:27.880]  society's poorest and most vulnerable. And for me, that's not socialism. It's, you know,
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:32.200]  if anything, it's Christian, it's spiritual, it's, you know, that's why I believe it's
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:36.200]  the most important issue. I think if you're in a position of power and your priority is
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:41.440]  not helping the poor and the dispossessed, then you shouldn't be in power. Now, of course,
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:47.480]  a healthy society across the board, you know, and hierarchies are always going to be to
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:53.160]  a degree necessary. But for me, on a human level, I feel our obligation is to help those
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:54.160]  that are suffering.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:00.200]  Sure. You've got a giant Twitter account. What is it? Rusty Rockets. Is there any other
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.360]  places on the web people should should visit other than that? And your TV site?
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:10.760]  No, that's what called for me, mate. I already follow you and stuff. But let's keep this
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:13.000]  style going. And I hope I see you in Austin.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.280]  You bet. And I said that was the final question. One more. And I'll let you get on down the
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:20.800]  road. I know you're at the airport. One last question. I've got to ask you here, Russell.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:27.680]  You mentioned Jesus and Shegwavara and Gandhi and Malcolm X, but it says and Hitler. And
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:32.040]  that's one reason I want to see your show. This is such an icon that she used everywhere.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:36.680]  But in your research, you got to give away a little bit. What's the angle on hair Hitler?
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:43.360]  Well, that was, Hitler's actions were deplorable. It's not his extremism that is terrifying.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:51.000]  It's his mundanity. He was just a normal man created by a number of geopolitical, economic
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.800]  and religious circumstances. Their size.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:53.800]  At that time. Yeah.
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:59.760]  In Germany. Yeah. Of course, Versailles and the anti-Semitism that was very prominent
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:06.360]  in that part of Europe at that time. But now we don't have like in those days, it was clear
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:13.160]  what evil was. Evil is Adolf Hitler. Now evil comes dressed in the white of Ronald McDonald.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:19.360]  Now evil is hidden behind the Apple logo. Now evil is indescribable in derivative bundles
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:25.480]  and in dispossessed millions. So again, it's about the narrative and the way we talk stories.
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:30.360]  Exactly. It knows how to hide and deciphering it and knowing what evil is. Yeah, is really
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:34.520]  the answer. Russell Brand, thank you so much. And I look forward to hopefully meeting you
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:41.520]  when you're in Austin in a few weeks. I'll be at your show regardless. Thank you for

[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:59.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:44.440]  Yeah, one thing that I think is important for people to understand, the UN is more of
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:50.280]  a tool of the globalist than a danger in and of itself. But with that said, drawing from
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:54.880]  the United Nations and defunding the United Nations would set the globalist spec decades.
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:58.960]  They're thinking to use the United Nations as the nucleus of this global tyranny that
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:03.000]  they're trying to impose. And they're doing it on all fronts, human rights, global warming.
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.120]  All of these pseudo-pretexts for global government are being exploited. So if we could get the
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:12.120]  United States out of the UN, and there's a bill in Congress to do it right now, HR75,
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:16.760]  Restore American Sovereignty Act by Representative Brown in Georgia, if we could get the United
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:21.200]  States out of the United Nations, we would set the globalist spec by maybe generations.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:25.560]  And so I think it's a very worthy goal. It's a good goal for all of us to aspire to. We
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:29.920]  need to educate our communities about the danger of the UN. And we can use that momentum
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:34.720]  to defund and then withdraw from the dictator's club.
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:39.120]  And that's what it is. That's what really exposes the UN. They never criticize dictators
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:44.480]  and horrible regimes. It's always Christians, family groups, private property. And then
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:49.120]  it's a bunch of corrupt billionaires on top of it, like George Soros, telling someone
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.120]  that makes $100,000 a year how they're a greedy pig.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:56.720]  Leon in Utah, thanks for holding your own the year with Alex Newman.
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:03.960]  Hey, Alex. Hey, Mr. Newman and fellow patriotic citizen of the United States. We'll have a
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:08.200]  few things that I'd want to just point out real quick. I mean, what are we supposed to
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:13.320]  do, guys? What do we, what's the plan? I mean, overall, we can see that things are, you know,
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:18.640]  they're expanding in a way that beyond our comprehension in terms of they want to just
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:22.720]  knock on our doors and say, hand over your guns.
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:27.520]  We know that people are going to stand their grounds and we know that people are going
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:33.000]  to defend themselves. And it's going to be a bloodbath, to be honest with you, that it's
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.960]  something that we all have to understand. And many people, I feel like they lack discipline
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:42.360]  because they don't listen. They don't, they're not aware of the things that are going on
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:46.880]  around us. I mean, just a couple of days ago, I guess, you know, Russia or even today, they're
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:50.480]  threatening that, you know, that they're saying that America is sounding off the drum for
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:56.480]  World War Three. I mean, you can obviously tell that things are, they're not right here.
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:01.280]  And I mean, we know that violent protests take us nowhere. And, you know, they obviously
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:08.360]  don't agree with the self protection. And so what's the plan? What kind of action are
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:15.080]  we supposed to take? Aside from petitioning and, you know, and, you know, protests, what's
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:16.640]  the answer here?
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:22.920]  To me, what they can do, I always say, first of all, resist calls for violence. Most of
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:26.360]  the time, those are probably going to be coming from federal provocateurs and globalists
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:30.960]  anyways. Resist calls to just divide and conquer. It's not about race. It's not about
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:35.080]  class. It's not about any of these things. It's about globalist criminals versus the
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.120]  people of the United States. They're liberties and all that is right and good in the world.
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:42.520]  Now, in terms of what to do, we have a lot of tools available to us. One of the most
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:46.040]  important is educating our communities. We still have our free speech. We still have
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:50.400]  the internet so we can get the information out and that is going to be key. We have the
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.840]  ballot box. We can vote bad politicians who don't obey their oath of office out of office.
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:01.840]  We have the jury. So, you know, don't convict your fellow citizens for trumped up crimes
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:06.240]  that the federal government or whatever imagines have been committed. So, we still have all
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.240]  the tools that we need.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:12.720]  That's right. If the people become motivated and highly active and know what's happening,
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:18.040]  if all of you become media folks in your own area or activist or jury activist, whatever
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:24.160]  the case is, there's no way the globalist can be successful. If you just point people
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:30.240]  at New American Magazine or in FullWars.com or WorldNetDaily.com or PrisonPlanet.com or
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:35.880]  DrudgeReport.com, not that any of us are perfect, but we're promoting basic information. Thomas
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:40.080]  Jefferson said that if you've got an informed public and you've got free information and
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:44.400]  you've got good information that tyranny will vanish like phantoms at dawn, that's what's
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:49.000]  happening and we're starting to see a lot of victories. Congress has a 7% approval rating.
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.360]  We just have to go to the next level to hold their feet to the fire. Alex Newman will watch
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:54.560]  this treaty closely. Thank you so much.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:56.200]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:03.200]  You bet. We'll be back with Gerald Salante, the Top Trends Forecast.
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:47.200]  We turned jeans inside out, Diamond Gusset Jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:51.240]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset Comfort with Kevlar Protection so you can

[02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:00.800]  Others don't.
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:04.600]  Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape. And the truth is, it's hard
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:09.920]  even with diet and exercise because of toxic food in our environment that is stressing our
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:14.480]  bodies more than ever before. Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:19.000]  that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise, were the
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:23.280]  answers that synergistically worked. I can see the drastic changes every day with the
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:28.080]  amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in my eye. That's why
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:32.960]  we are now so excited to launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack, combining three essential
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:39.280]  formulations, oxygen-based cleanser oxy-powder, the Secret 12 Bioavailable Vitamin B12, and

[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:26.440]  Distance to Tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:30.040]  Gerald Salente is going to be our guest for the balance of the hour. Always look forward
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:36.280]  to Gerald joining us. We'll be talking to him here in just one moment. Some of the stories
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:44.120]  online now at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Christina Sarich has an article. Politicians
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:52.400]  silence nine-year-old overposting photos of school lunch. Do you want to know what some
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:58.480]  kids are being served at school every day? A classic example of tyranny. And it goes
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:03.640]  through the fact that the school says you're not allowed to take photos of the food that
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:10.280]  the school has and you're going to get in trouble if you continue that. And that sounds
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:16.080]  like something innocuous who cares. Well, then they can feed them prison-style food if that's
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:21.280]  the case. And by the way, the photo of the hamburgers we have on there is not the school
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:26.800]  food. The school food looks like prisoner food when you go look at the photos. And it's
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:31.520]  reversing the Michelle Obama boondoggle all over the country that people can't see the
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:36.240]  photos. So their answer is don't make it high quality food or end federalization of the
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:43.760]  food. No, just end free speech. Interesting article, the forecaster. Can this computer
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:50.360]  predict the future? The government certainly thinks so. Articles at infowars.com. And it
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:59.040]  goes over the fact that the feds seized after 10 years of economic forecaster Martin Armstrong
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:03.600]  sat in federal prison. They seized a computer system he came up that they believe has an
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:08.760]  algorithm that can predict the future. Folks, the Google can predict the future now with
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:15.360]  mass movements. Facebook can predict it. You get enough tens of millions of people simultaneously.
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:20.120]  It gives you in mass movements, true predictability. How do you think Amazon can individually
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:23.720]  know what you're going to order now before you order and have it being packaged before
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:30.000]  you even buy it? Or now pizza huts are coming out with iPads in the wall that face scan
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.040]  your retina as you look at the menu and then it decides and tells you what you wanted to
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:41.440]  order. Just like Google gives you predictive searches tailored to what you want. This is
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:45.640]  how they're going to manipulate society and then actually start telling you you want something
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:51.280]  when you don't. Talk about laziness. Talk about mind control. Those articles are up at
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:56.120]  infowars.com. Another story that I want to get Gerald Salente's take on first, then the
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:01.840]  economy, Russia, the world and his top trends for 2015 that he's going to preview here for
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:09.040]  us with his trends journal today. Zuckerberg lauds socialism with China's internet censorship
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:18.280]  czar. Facebook CEO visit with Lou Wee, hypocritical and absurd. Now this is a guy praising them
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:22.360]  when they literally have people arrested and executed for using the internet improperly
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:26.520]  they claim and now they're trying to learn Obama's been meeting with them how to do this
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:33.040]  here. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that calls his users dumb efforts for trusting him lauded
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:38.360]  the virtues of socialism during a recent meeting with Lou Wee, the czar of China's draconian
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:42.240]  internet censorship system. We can scroll down and show you a nice picture of him as
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:49.680]  Mao Zedong. Having previously met with the State Department official, Kathrena Novelli
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:55.240]  who urged the two countries to work together as friends on web security, that means ending
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:59.920]  free speech. We paid a visit to Facebook Silicon Valley offices despite the fact that the social
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:04.200]  networking website is completely banned in China. During the meeting we discovered a
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:10.240]  book written by Chinese President Jiang Ziping called the governance of China sitting on Zuckerberg's
[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:15.160]  office desk. Leading Zuckerberg to comment, I bought this book for my co-workers. I want
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:19.760]  them to understand socialism with Chinese characteristics and went on to praise it.
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:23.760]  Truly sickening. Let me give you the Chinese characteristic of that. Most generals there
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:29.440]  are billionaires and there's no social network when people chain their kids up. They're toddlers
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:33.120]  up and they go work in the slave factories building robots that are now going to replace
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:41.400]  them. Here's the headline national review. China's promises to end harvesting the executed.
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:45.280]  I remember about 10 years ago the State Department came out and said it was a rumor, even though
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:52.360]  the Communist Chinese advertised in trade publications that they have quote, fresh organs.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:56.400]  Whatever you need and they keep the Falun Gong peaceful practitioners that are healthy
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:01.400]  genetically and blood tested in prison cells waiting for when Richie Rich wants to show
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:08.600]  up and get the goodies. You don't hear the trendies complaining about that. See when
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:13.000]  there's pressure on the organ harvesting, just come out and call it a conspiracy theory
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.680]  even though the BBC now has this headline. China has promised to stop harvesting organs
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:22.600]  from executed prisoners by January 1st. Take me to your reports. Death row inmates have
[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:28.600]  long served as a key source of transplants. Here's the promise, but it's not the first.
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:35.960]  They've done it many times. We take you now to Kingston, New York, site the Star of the
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:41.360]  American Revolution and Gerald Solente joining us via video Skype. Gerald, thanks for coming
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:45.120]  on. We're going to cover the waterfront today. I want to get into a whole bunch of stuff,
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:49.680]  but what do you make of this hypocrisy and Zuckerberg calling people dumb efforts? What
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:53.720]  do you make of Gruber admitting Obamacare is a giant screw job? I mean, you've worked
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:59.960]  as a consultant, as a lobbyist, as Fortune 500 guy. Why are these people so arrogant?
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:04.200]  You always speak to the white shoe boys and the Harvard mafia. Well, that's where he's
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:10.800]  from. And now he's over at MIT producing lies to fool the American people. Why would he
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:15.280]  brag? Why would Zuckerberg brag? What's their problem?
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:23.040]  Well, why are sociopaths, sociopaths and psychopaths, psychopaths and going back to Zuckerberg
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:30.960]  talking about socialism in China? Could anyone say communism? That's what it is. And remember
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:38.000]  who sold us out and when it began with Bill Clinton and be more as I keep thinking about
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.840]  this and I keep thinking about that little grubby Gruber talking about how stupid we
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:50.200]  are and how they could pull things over our eyes. Also, Alex, I used to run political
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:56.320]  campaigns in Westchester County. He had a graduate school back in the early 1970s and
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:02.200]  I was the assistant to the secretary of the New York State Senate. So I was right there.
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:07.360]  I was sitting in the back of the chamber with Malcolm Wilson, who was the governor, my boss,
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:16.200]  Al Abrams, nice guy and the head of the Republican Party, Anderson, John Anderson. So I was right
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:21.960]  there. I saw what it looked like. I know the game. I know the way it's run. And what's
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:31.720]  going on is the system is being run by lowlifes who are, to me, nothing more than traitors
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:38.840]  to America. They are all traitors. Slick Willy Clinton, a traitor for selling us out to the
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:46.000]  Chinese with NAFTA, for selling us out with the other traitor, Robert Rubin, who deregulated
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:52.640]  the Glass-Steagall Act that allowed the banks to steal all our dough. Traitors, this guy
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:58.720]  Gruber, you could keep going after one after another and go back again to Zuckerberg talking
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:08.240]  about China. Let's go back to two weeks after 9-11. Go look at what oil prices were back
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:15.760]  then. They were in the $20 a barrel range. And then when everybody wasn't looking and
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:23.720]  the CIA liars, and I love the words that they use, the prostitute language. Remember, Alex,
[02:16:23.720 --> 02:16:29.960]  we always have to be proper because people don't like it when you're not proper. So we
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:39.240]  have to say the CIA misled, misled, grow up, junior. They're liars. They lied us into the
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:46.520]  Afghan war. They lied us into the Iraq war. You remember those weapons of mass destruction
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:54.520]  and ties to Al Qaeda. You remember that next mushroom cloud you see? Condoleezza, right?
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:17:03.000]  Yeah. One liar after another. Now let's go back. Two weeks after 9-11. Zack Zuckerberg,
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  China, they brought it into the World Trade Organization when no one was looking. And
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:17.000]  then you saw the increase in oil prices. You saw the phony boom start being built. They
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:27.680]  sold us out. Clinton, Bush, Obama, Pelosi, Reid, McConnell, Graham, one after another.
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:34.920]  They are traders to the Constitution, traders to the Bill of Rights, traders to America.
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:41.640]  All of these people are traders, and they should be brought up on war criminal charges
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:48.480]  and treason against we the people and everything that we stand for.
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:54.920]  I agree. And do you agree with me that clearly they're trying to start racial division and
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:57.920]  play the people off against the police? When the police are obviously even federalized,
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:02.120]  a lot of bad stuff there. But the politicians want to get us all fighting with each other
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:07.960]  instead of realizing they're the enemy. And this is all a desperate tactic promoting all
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:17.360]  of this division. Go back to our spring trends journal. Went out three weeks before Ferguson.
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:23.840]  The article that we asked Dr. Paul Craig Roberts to write was Cops Gone Wild. How the police
[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:29.760]  have gone wild in this country. It's more than a racial issue. It's an issue against
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:37.360]  we the people that the traders that have destroyed our Constitution and Bill of Rights with the
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:43.760]  so-called Patriot Act, with the National Defense Authorization Act have robbed us of our rights
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:47.880]  and militarized our nation, particularly after 9-11.
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:55.680]  Racial, hey, a racist nation. Are they a racist in America? Of course they are. Hey, I'm an
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:02.560]  Italian American. You want to see discrimination? Hey, put on a show like the Sopranos with
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:07.760]  the Jewish people. Yeah, do one like that. Try it with the blacks. Hey, how about with
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:14.880]  the Spanish? Yeah, Rodriguez San Jose. Yeah, doing dirty deals. Try that one out. Are they
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:21.720]  racist? Are they bigots? Of course they are. Is America a racist nation? No. If we were
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:28.880]  a racist nation, Alex, would we have a black president? Hey, how about that attorney general?
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:35.440]  What color is he? I forgot about Condoleezza Rice. Remember her? What about Colin Powell?
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:41.720]  Hey, who's that? Homeland Security Johnson Watt? What color is your skin? I've had enough
[02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:50.240]  of it. Hey, who's the woman running national security? Oh, Susan Rice? Yeah, White? White
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:56.960]  is Rice? No. Stay there, Gerald Salente. We'll give his website out. We come back, friendsresearch.com,

[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:34.240]  This is an alert. If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay
[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:38.640]  more than you should. This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space,
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:42.640]  church or warehouse. A general steel building can save you as much as half the cost and
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:47.280]  time of similar conventional construction. And we're offering rebates of up to $20,000

[02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:05.520]  to lose weight and get in shape. And the truth is, it's hard. Even with diet and exercise,
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:10.200]  because of toxic food in our environment, that is stressing our bodies more than ever
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:14.600]  before. Working with experts in nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality
[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:19.480]  nutraceuticals, in addition to my diet and exercise, were the answers that synergistically
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:23.920]  worked. I can see the drastic changes every day with the amount of weight I've lost, my
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:28.360]  increased stamina and more of a twinkle in my eye. That's why we are now so excited to
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:34.080]  launch the InfoWars Life Resolution Pack. Combining three essential formulations, oxygen-based

[02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:57.520]  Thank you.
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:24.800]  There's so much good stuff in the world that that's why I'm angry and upset. I want to
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:29.520]  defend it. I don't want to be a slave. But you really can't doubt the fact that tyranny
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:34.640]  is moving on all fronts. I've criticized the militarization of police. I've exposed it
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:39.280]  probably like nobody else. But then I can see the feds trying to come in and make every
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:45.080]  evil in the world about the police when it's worldwide the federalization, the globalization,
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:50.600]  and the militarization has been happening as criminal ruling classes move from free market
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:55.440]  to crony systems. Gerald Salente, I want to start getting into the top trends of 2015,
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:00.000]  your new journal that's just about to come out. It's just invaluable reading. Hope everybody
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.480]  goes to TrendsResearch.com and subscribes or at least signs up for your free alerts and
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:10.440]  looks at the 2015 forecast. You're going to give us a first look here today. But in this
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:16.080]  short segment, what do you think the state of the world itself is? Obama says that he
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:20.600]  stabilized the world and that it's never been more secure. Hegel said the world's never
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:25.720]  been more insecure. So he fired him. What is the real state of the world overall in your
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:31.240]  view? We're heading toward world war. It's blowing out all over the place. Anybody that's
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:37.720]  half awake and listening to watching what's going on can see it. And I want to stay on
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:43.880]  this China issue again with Zuckerberg sucking up over there. Well, Zuckerberg maybe would
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:50.800]  be more appropriate. Yeah, Zuckerberg. There we go. And you look what's going on here and
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:58.800]  around the world. You go back to one of our top trends for 2014. China boom town. America's
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:03.880]  in the business award. China's in the business of business. They're buying up the world and
[02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:09.320]  they're buying up America. Hey, folks, you like that? Obama always calls everybody folks.
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:16.560]  Yeah, folks, folks, you like that Smithfield pork? Hey, owned by China, huh? Oh, yeah.
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:22.440]  Hey, how about that Waldorf Astoria in New York? Hey, Chinese just bought it for two
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:27.560]  billion, didn't they? Oh, were they getting the dough? Ah, yes. Just did another deal
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:34.080]  right here in New York. That only about a billion dollars. Who's funding it? The Chinese
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:40.240]  National or the Chinese Bank? Communist government. You go look what's going on over there in
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:44.640]  Portugal. You know, they're privatizing everything private. My problem. I mean, I want to get
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:49.880]  into what real privatization is. But the Communist Chinese already every month, I see where they're
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:55.080]  controlling TV shows, movies, what can be published. Michael Savage couldn't even get
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:58.640]  his book promoted anywhere. The publisher wouldn't promote it because the Chinese threatened
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:04.600]  him because he criticized. I mean, the Communist China is a big fat sensor. That's my problem.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:10.720]  Well, again, they're communists. I mean, I grew up most of my life teaching us to hate
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:16.120]  communists. Hey, those Russians, they're no good. But those Chinese commies, our kind
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:22.960]  of guys. Gee, I wonder why couldn't be because of all of the American manufacturers that sold
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:29.680]  us out and and bought all their cheaper product over there to be made by slave labor. So the
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:35.440]  Chinese communists are good commies. All those Cubans, they're bad commies, too. There's
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:41.480]  only good commies and bad commies. It's all about business, Alex. And that's what I want
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:48.400]  to talk about. The business of business is China. And China's buying up the world. And
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:55.520]  you look at the numbers, as I said, privatization going on all throughout Europe. It's not privatization.
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:01.520]  It's selling more valuable public assets at bargain basement prices to do dirty deals
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:07.120]  with your pals. They just had a big auction in Portugal. You know what the major language
[02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:12.880]  was of the people bidding? Mandarin. You look what's going on in Canada. Look what's going
[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:18.560]  on in the United States. The Chinese economies collapsed. The smart money over there knows
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:25.560]  it. They have 70 million, that's right, million vacant luxury apartments. Entire cities that
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:31.640]  are vacant. Their bubble has burst. Look, they lowered interest rates, 40 basis points
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:37.040]  trying to pump this thing up. Goes back to the trends of 2015. One of them is called
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:44.680]  price wars. Why? Because there's oversupply and overcapacity of just about everything.
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:52.200]  It's not only oil prices that are going down because of oversupply and less demand. It's
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:29:00.480]  copper prices. It's corn prices. It's iron ore. You could buy rebar, reinforcement rod.
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:08.320]  A ton of reinforcement rod over in China costs less than a ton of cabbage. What they're doing,
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:14.960]  they are aware of the collapse that's coming. They're taking their money and they're buying
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:21.440]  up the world. You better learn how to speak Chinese and learn how to be a better commie
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:29.040]  because the politicians in this nation have sold us out and continue to do so. They love
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:34.760]  it. It's like Gruber. It's one thing to raise rates and rip off poor people and cut their
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:41.560]  health care, but he enjoys it. Enjoys lying. Enjoys cheating. Enjoys screwing people over.
[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:47.720]  A bunch of low life degenerate, filthy scum, but we've let them do it. So it's our fault
[02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:54.400]  because we're a bunch of chumps. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones
[02:29:54.400 --> 02:30:03.240]  and the GCN Radio Network. Every year we make resolutions to lose weight and get in shape.
[02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:07.920]  And the truth is it's hard, even with diet and exercise, because of toxic food in our
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:12.360]  environment that is stressing our bodies more than ever before. Working with experts in
[02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:16.920]  nutrition and biochemistry, I found that super high quality nutraceuticals, in addition to
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:22.400]  my diet and exercise, were the answers synergistically worked. I can see the drastic changes every
[02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:26.840]  day with the amount of weight I've lost, my increased stamina, and more of a twinkle in
[02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:32.120]  my eye. That's why we are now so excited to launch the InfoWarsLife Resolution Pack, combining
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:37.840]  three essential formulations, oxygen based cleanser oxy powder, the secret 12 bioavailable

[02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:05.600]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:10.080]  toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air
[02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:15.240]  has been shown to have 2-5 times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most
[02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:20.160]  Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes. There
[02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:25.080]  are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand types of mold
[02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:29.680]  and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans
[02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:33.720]  live with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics it
[02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:39.440]  was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[02:32:39.440 --> 02:32:44.160]  that we cannot escape until we can fight back against. Made with organic and wild cultivated
[02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:49.560]  herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleans is here in a convenient
[02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:53.520]  spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment. Now available
[02:32:53.520 --> 02:33:09.360]  exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:22.480]  Raging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of

[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:57.240]  three detoxes are enough to do three weeks of this so every few months you can do it
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:04.920]  that's a three four months supply in one bottle of oxy powder and we've got it available
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:13.000]  and discounted at InfoWarsLife.com we did sell out of several of the nutraceuticals

[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:51.240]  at InfoWarsStore.com InfoWarsLife.com or 888-2533-139 Gerald Salentes our guest trends research.com
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:56.120]  Gerald I want to give you the floor now you know for the next 10 minutes or so and then
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:02.720]  I want to get in some other topics with you to look at the big trends of 2015 and also
[02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:09.720]  looking back on the trends of 2014-2013 that you unfortunately very accurately gauged and
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:14.120]  in your trends I want to get your take on Russia because you were talking about that
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:20.760]  a few years ago I don't lionize Russia but as you know they're really trying to destabilize
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:24.640]  it they're trying to cut off their pipelines they're trying to screw up their deals they're
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:29.960]  lowering oil prices and trying to bankrupt them so that then there'll be no competition
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:34.480]  they can jack it up as high as they want in my view and a lot of mainline analysts not
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:41.160]  just you or Dr. Paul Craig Roberts or myself are saying this could lead to actual war is
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:50.240]  there no amount of hubris out of these Harvard mafia people that though they act like miscreant
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:55.640]  weasels are in control of the nuclear arsenal.
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:00.160]  Well they again you know we're looking at who they are and everything they do they turn
[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:05.520]  into disaster there's not one thing that anybody could point to this says look at the great
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:12.320]  job that the DC gang has done whether it's in healthcare whether it's in education whether
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:19.840]  it's in military whether it's in the environment whether it's in food safety go up and down
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:27.240]  the list and before I go on I want to also encourage all the listeners of info wars
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:34.120]  to support what you're doing as you know that we do and we advertise an info wars magazine
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:38.480]  because you're one of the few people out there along with a number of us that are concerned
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:44.720]  with the truth and the truth isn't abstract I'll give you an example why it's not abstract
[02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:51.600]  begins with our conversation today about the CIA quote misleading it's not misleading
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:38:00.760]  it's lying there's a lie in the truth it's not about banks misleading or misdeeds it's
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:07.080]  about corruption and thievery so there is a truth and when enough people support the
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:15.320]  truth then the truth as they say shall make us free so I really encourage everyone during
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:21.600]  this holiday season to do what they can to keep promoting your voice of freedom and as
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:28.480]  we look at the whole situation of what's devolving and the bigger picture the bigger picture is
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:35.120]  that we see in 2015 is this is the year of the game changer look what's going on in the
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:42.280]  markets as we're speaking all of a sudden the markets are now under pressure the Shanghai
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:48.960]  index today lost over five percent it down over two percent across Europe again what's
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:55.360]  going on in oil yes it's an oversupply issue but it's a lack of demand issue because when
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:00.920]  you go through all of the commodities again whether it's corn whether it's iron ore whether
[02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:08.080]  it's copper you're looking at five year loads you're looking at a global slowdown and the
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:16.400]  way they get your mind off the global slowdown is with war and going back to Russia how they've
[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:22.280]  taught us how to hate Russia and you well know we were on top of this we saw it coming
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:30.400]  with the Sochi Olympics again prior to the destabilization of the Ukraine hey Alex don't
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:37.480]  go to Sochi because if you get on one of those airplanes watch out for those toothpaste bombs
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:46.200]  who can make this stuff up I'll tell you who a bunch of sick SOB's hey Alex don't go to
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:53.360]  Sochi not if you like animals because they're shooting all those stray dogs and don't drink
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:40:02.080]  the water no no no it's all yellow yeah and hey those hotel rooms they're garbage they
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:12.160]  started to defame Russia before it happened by the time the Olympics began America's perception
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:20.760]  of Russia was at a 1994 low I'll tell everyone out there listening you want to get into a
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:27.000]  good business you could do it cheaply doesn't have to make any sense and you can make a
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:35.080]  lot of dough doing it propaganda that's the business to get into watch out for those ISIS
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:43.560]  fear and hysteria all of the propaganda coming out against Russia let's put this into perspective
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:52.760]  every week if not every day we keep hearing about Russian troop movements Russian tanks
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:41:00.480]  Russian armored vehicles flooding over the Russian border into Ukraine hey Alex have
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:10.000]  you seen any pictures yet nothing they show us nothing in this world of selfies you can't
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:17.840]  show us one photo no I'll tell you why because they're liars they're sociopaths they are
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:27.840]  leading us to war the global economy is collapsing only a psychopath would want to put sanctions
[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:33.840]  on Russia that only hurts really the Europeans because we don't do that much business with
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:41.800]  them at a time when the European economy is in the crapper oh that's right unemployment
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:52.160]  in Italy yeah it's at record lows over 13% there's a oh oh look what happened today in
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:42:00.440]  the Greek stock market now you turn on CBS Bloomberg you see the little prostitutes come
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:07.280]  out there and say hi there's recovery over there in Greece they're out of a recession
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:16.560]  she wonder why the markets down 11% today so you can see only a moron a psychopath and
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:23.160]  a sociopath would put sanctions on Russia now that Russians are putting sanctions on
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:29.160]  the Europeans and who is it hurting well it's hurting the small people in Europe yeah the
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:36.120]  ones that used to sell product to Russia so they're destroying the global economy and
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:46.360]  when I said before Alex this isn't a throwaway line that Obama who's launched a war against
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:53.400]  Syria that's dropping bombs on a sovereign nation and you remember the line about that
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:43:00.680]  humanitarian mission that we're not going back in Iraq no no no we're there on a humanitarian
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:07.760]  mission to save those Christians on the mountain and then Yazidis you know what a Yazidi is I'm
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:14.680]  sure you got them all over San Antonio we got to save them too no no it's not all those
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:21.200]  bombing runs they're doing every day and who's he doing it with doesn't even ask Congress
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:29.240]  Congress doesn't even care their traders these people are committing treason their treasonous
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:36.440]  acts and no one wants to call it what it is their treasonous acts of war their treasonous
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:44.360]  acts that are robbing us of our constitutional rights of our bill of rights and our money
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:52.640]  because they make up things one of the top trends oh by the way we have decided we selected
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:44:00.040]  the people for info wars to hear our list of top 10 trends of top trends for 2015 before
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:07.600]  anyone else they just went out to our subscribers as we're talking we also had a conference
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:15.120]  here in colonial Kingston this last Saturday a video of that is also available a five hour
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:20.600]  conference we put on and people if they go to our website they can sign up to get that
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:28.320]  as well but we selected info wars because these are the people of all of the media that's
[02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:35.760]  putting out to the people freedom of speech thought and spirit no one is doing it to the
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:43.240]  level that you are so we decided this is the one we're going to first and going back to
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:50.200]  the top trends bankism people are saying this is a failure of capitalism no it's not it's
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:56.720]  bankism the banks are in control and the person that's writing this story for us in the trends
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:45:02.760]  journal and we have a synopsis out now is know me prince who of course wrote that great
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:10.720]  book all the presidents bankers so don't complain about capitalism four words killed it everybody
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:16.880]  knows what they are too big to fail brought to you by Henry Paulson former CEO of the
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:24.520]  Goldman Sachs gang now playing big roles as Frankenstein in a freak show near you what
[02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:33.360]  else do we have hey the grand manipulation it is no free markets everything is rigged
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:39.200]  we know libor is rigged at only the seven hundred trillion dollars that's right the interest
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:46.720]  rates but we're not going to punish anybody no no no it's just misdeeds and they misled
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:52.760]  so we'll only find them and the same thing with the forex the currency exchange of which
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:46:00.920]  they trade five point three trillion dollars a day on and on gold manipulation as detailed
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:09.640]  and written in this issue by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts are the big trend price wards get
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:15.960]  ready for it here's something this is going to go out later we just started writing about
[02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:24.000]  it today this is a headline if these equity markets continue to go in the direction that
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:31.720]  they are this is going to be a rocket that's going to knock Santa out of the sky and the
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:38.200]  retail sales are going to plummet look what already happened with black Friday came in
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:44.200]  on the red didn't it no it didn't go up four point one percent as the national retail
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:54.920]  federation had predicted down 11 percent now you pile on that declining markets fear fear
[02:46:54.920 --> 02:47:01.600]  spreading across the world of the overblown equity markets that were only propped up
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:09.280]  because of low interest rates and trillions of dollars of phony money flooding in you're
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:16.680]  going to see a disastrous Christmas which brings us to the trend price wards you're
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:22.440]  going to see 50 percent 75 percent they're going to want to unload the garbage that
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:30.040]  they have made in China at any price they could get rather than being caught with oversupply
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:37.120]  of product you look at the sales even at the luxury end product is getting blown away
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:43.400]  one after another so when you start putting these trends together how do they get your
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:50.000]  mind off it I'll tell you how you saw it they did with ISIS remember they beheaded those
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:58.800]  guys who beheadings are bad drones away and that's okay that's a clean blowout but man
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:05.520]  get bombs fine but no beheadings and the people buy it they buy it like they buy thirty
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:12.840]  two ounce phosphorescent slurpees you could sell them anything so when you start putting
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:17.800]  the trends together and keep looking where it's going you go back into the positive
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:28.200]  ones like you said the millennial generation they are going to be right for retrograde
[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:33.840]  there this is the only generation coming up where they're looking and those of us that
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:41.200]  are old enough remember that all our lives the polls used to show the future is going
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:47.720]  to be greater than the present not anymore now they look at the future they say modern
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:54.120]  is bad now it's only going to get worse they're looking for a future that they're going to
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:49:01.800]  take from the past remember the Renaissance in Italy happened after the black plague ninety
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:07.960]  sixty percent of Europeans were killed they were dead they realized what are we doing
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:17.120]  wrong so they went back to the past a renaissance a rebirth a rediscovery retrograde they're
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:23.120]  going to take from the past and retrofit it for the future this is one of the biggest
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:29.520]  trends that people should look into because the millennial generation a lot they're not
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:35.360]  stupid a lot of these kids are really shocked and they know they're getting shafted and
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:44.600]  they can see who the shifter is and they know they're getting it on the blunt end so manufacturers
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:51.440]  get it ties into local it ties into high quality you will finding out in our research at music
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:57.400]  schools these kids aren't going back to rock and roll they're not going back to Louis Armstrong
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:50:02.240]  they're not going back to Ella Fitzgerald they're going back to Bessie Smith they're
[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:09.880]  going back to Django Reinhardt beyond they're going back to Jelly Roll Morton they're going
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:17.520]  back to the roots the roots of America that made this country what it was anybody can
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:22.920]  complain and I don't want to hear the stories I'm very aware of them what we did to the
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:30.200]  genocide of the Indians the inequality that we did to blacks I'm very familiar with it
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:37.400]  but this was also the land of opportunity I make this very clear Gerald stay there explain

[02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:21.640]  cutting off Alex Jones here back live is that you have to look at the time we lived
[02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:29.120]  in 250 years ago we're only taught about America's evils but when compared to other countries
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:35.600]  it was very tame in some cases and some it was very barbarous but the idea of not having
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:40.600]  a big government not having royalty that's being bowed to in the White House today the
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:47.280]  idea of the little people having ideas and and quality and I'm already seeing this renaissance
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:51.800]  as liberal trendies that move to Austin are not just going out and learning how to square
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:56.280]  dance and I'm not saying that's even good but it's it's it's good to see them trying
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:55:02.040]  to to to do something folky or authentic they're going out and buying guns they're going out
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:07.060]  and buying four-wheel drive trucks they are breaking with the system and becoming more
[02:55:07.060 --> 02:55:12.520]  libertarian more rugged and unfortunately original Texans are sitting in their trailer
[02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:17.600]  houses watching satellite TV all day and on a heart attacks but I think that's what Gerald's
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:22.000]  trying to get at people go into truck farms people go into organic farms people getting
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:26.480]  into going to thrift stores to get their clothes half the time it's better than a big and I'm
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:31.640]  not saying big corporate stores are you know the devil in every case but they're all lobbying
[02:55:31.640 --> 02:55:36.000]  to get laws passed where you can't have a farmer's market so if we shop just like the
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:41.160]  organic food market that didn't exist 20 years ago and demand it it will grow it will lower
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:48.040]  the price it will supplant the rest of the economy and and so there is a major quest
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:53.720]  now by young people I'd say 30 and below to look for something better is that what you're
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:56:00.760]  getting at Gerald yes that's exactly it and again going back quality look at the buildings
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:06.200]  they used to build look at the junk they put up now a big box store it's like going shopping
[02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:12.920]  in a large self storage unit yes so it's they're looking for quality because they know that
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:18.680]  quality is going to improve their lives beauty and quality are going to be big sellers the
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:25.680]  marketers that understand it rediscovering the beauty is wealth exactly again what was
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:31.320]  the Renaissance and look what's happened and again as I was saying before you know people
[02:56:31.320 --> 02:56:38.120]  could criticize this country we were we were the envy of the world it was the land of opportunity
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:44.480]  as I say my blood is Italian but my heart is American I could never be me if I was born
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:50.960]  anywhere else the freedom that I was given that you're taking away now so going on to
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:57.960]  some other trends and it all ties together gold the golden age the boomers are now you
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:04.400]  know I'm born in 1946 this is one of the biggest markets to play at you were talking
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:10.920]  about all the people sitting around watching stupid television going for the gold is going
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:17.440]  to go for the golden age in exercises no not these muscle trips how do you stay healthy
[02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:24.600]  and live longer you go to our website we did a video on June and Stanley Blum in 95 years
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:33.880]  old Stanley began painting at 80 when you in other name and other in other how you stay
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:40.600]  alive is learning and doing new things exactly and the market is that understand that in providing
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:46.120]  them products and services and I'm not talking about walkers and canes no treating old people
[02:57:46.120 --> 02:57:50.000]  like they're still people and then they'll act like people I won't decide to go die because
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:53.560]  all the studies show when old people feel like they're at need about the tribe they go turn
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:58.200]  off and die when they're treated like elders and respected and brought in they become the
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:03.040]  dynamic engine that then interlocks down to the first generation below them and then that
[02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:06.680]  down to the young people and that's why they've targeted the youth and told them to be forever
[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:10.480]  kids when they're supposed to be men and women earlier that's why they told old people oh
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:15.880]  it's your time to go to the beach and then they go and just die instead of staying alive
[02:58:15.880 --> 02:58:22.280]  perfectly said and so the old you get if you keep on learning the wise you get I remember
[02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:26.640]  when I was a little kid my father made so rest in peace meeting didn't he look at me
[02:58:26.640 --> 02:58:31.840]  and say you know Sunday say youth is wasted on the young take a couple more bites and
