[00:38.400 --> 00:43.960]  the victories we're having the sleeping giant has awakened the days of bullying
[00:43.960 --> 00:49.280]  the average American with bleeding heart liberal socialist lunacy appears to have
[00:49.280 --> 00:54.520]  run its course voters nationwide rallied to send a clear message to President
[00:54.520 --> 00:59.800]  Obama's administration and Hillary Clinton's campaign of left-field criminal madness you

[01:18.840 --> 01:25.400]  an end to Houston Mayor Anise Parker's moronic ordinance that subjected businesses with $5,000

[02:08.440 --> 02:14.040]  not a liberal issue conservative issue or moderate issue the Houston Chronicle reports
[02:14.040 --> 02:20.120]  Houston's controversial equal rights ordinance failed by a wide margin Tuesday with voters

[02:37.080 --> 02:42.920]  was hoping to capitalize on the tragic shooting of two Virginia TV reporters by a disgruntled
[02:42.920 --> 02:49.880]  newsman earlier this summer he pumped millions into the race for two critical state senate seats
[02:49.880 --> 02:55.160]  as a result both Democrats were able to dramatically outspend the republican rivals
[02:55.160 --> 03:00.760]  Bloomberg and his super PAC every town for gun safety hoped to show that Democrats could win
[03:00.760 --> 03:06.120]  on the issue of gun control also Governor McCulloch had made enacting new restrictions on
[03:06.120 --> 03:13.560]  gun ownership a centerpiece of his campaigning for Democrats around the state in San Francisco

[03:34.200 --> 03:39.560]  a Mexican illegal immigrant had been released from Mercurimi's jail despite the fact that

[05:04.600 --> 05:10.360]  stynum claims the current backlash against planned parenthood is part of an ultra right-wing attempt
[05:10.360 --> 05:16.680]  to restore the basis of patriarchy a long-term racist system which is controlling reproduction
[05:16.680 --> 05:22.360]  and to control reproduction you have to control the bodies of women what kind of inverted reality

[08:26.520 --> 08:32.360]  us airports in the wake of the russian airliner being blown up last week
[08:35.560 --> 08:42.760]  we knew this was coming the radical jihadis funded protected armed coddled by the west
[08:42.760 --> 08:51.480]  against striking western targets and now the very criminal government that has been funding
[08:51.480 --> 08:57.800]  these organizations will now take more of our freedoms but let's be clear even the average tsa
[08:57.800 --> 09:04.040]  person is not our enemy the average police officer is not our enemy the average even irs workers
[09:04.040 --> 09:15.720]  not our enemy they are misguided or desperate americans that have been brought up in a state
[09:15.720 --> 09:21.160]  of mind control i have a hugely full plate of over the top important news and guests today
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.080]  but i first want to speak to several issues here that keep coming up on the street not once but
[09:29.080 --> 09:37.160]  twice yesterday i ran into people that i know and in conversations they brought up that police
[09:37.160 --> 09:50.360]  officers that they know that they know know me relay the message why did you use to hate the
[09:50.360 --> 09:58.040]  police and and and say that we wanted the public to you know lick our boots but now you support
[09:58.040 --> 10:14.040]  the police and within that question you have really deep answers i talk a lot about rosetta
[10:14.040 --> 10:20.600]  stone articles rosetta stone stories rosetta stone developments that if you understand that
[10:20.600 --> 10:27.640]  that particular event it's a perfect way to see how it connects into so many other things
[10:28.920 --> 10:35.560]  the misperceptions the misunderstandings the way the public sees things in one dimensional
[10:36.360 --> 10:39.240]  ways or even two dimensional ways if they're lucky
[10:41.960 --> 10:47.800]  but if you can ever get people outside the box as the proverbial cliche goes you really
[10:47.800 --> 10:53.880]  can change the world so here's where i stand on the police i was never against the police
[10:54.840 --> 11:04.680]  just like i was never against black people or male delivery people or hispanics or germans or
[11:04.680 --> 11:15.320]  whatever i tried to expose the globalization the federalization the militarization of the police
[11:15.320 --> 11:20.600]  i was against the phony drug war because it was a contrived crisis to destabilize the country
[11:22.040 --> 11:25.880]  but people always see things either or either you totally support the drug war
[11:25.880 --> 11:34.440]  or you support everybody being on drugs and it's not either or drugs are a problem we'll have
[11:34.440 --> 11:40.760]  problems if they're legal we'll have problems if they're illegal but you've always got to go back
[11:40.760 --> 11:48.200]  to the question of what deploys the most human liberty and produces the freest most open society
[11:49.400 --> 11:55.320]  and that's a culture where drugs are decriminalized not completely legalized
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.960]  in my research view and you say what does that do with police well it's like the drug war
[12:01.480 --> 12:06.200]  i know the drug war was set up in the 30s after alcohol was legalized again after 10 years of
[12:06.200 --> 12:11.320]  prohibition the corrupt bureaucrats the corrupt city officials the corrupt police in many areas
[12:11.320 --> 12:17.640]  the corrupt mafias wanted something new to have a black market in i mean it's on record that that's
[12:17.640 --> 12:24.680]  what happened you could buy cocaine heroin opium anything you wanted and fetamines at the corner
[12:24.680 --> 12:32.840]  drugstore they'd go in and put a squirt of opium in the in the drink they put a squirt of cocaine
[12:32.840 --> 12:39.080]  in the drink and they put a squirt of different candy flavors in it and then boy you'd be ready
[12:39.080 --> 12:43.000]  to go out and sell some advertising for the newspaper if you were an advertising executive
[12:43.800 --> 12:49.960]  after you had your dr pepper in waco texas i use that example because one of my ancestors
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.960]  basically was the inventor of dr pepper that was the first soft drink kind of a curse to bring
[12:53.960 --> 12:59.160]  upon the world but uh he was an advertising executive and he liked his dr pepper and it the
[12:59.160 --> 13:06.680]  original dr pepper had cocaine in it it's a funny little story he named dr pepper and it was the drink
[13:06.680 --> 13:09.880]  he liked to mix he he didn't mass deploy it or sell it like the
[13:12.440 --> 13:16.760]  apothecary that was uh producing it but they did advertise in his newspapers he actually
[13:16.760 --> 13:26.120]  owned the newspapers but i'm digressing all of this ties in together i'm not against police i'm
[13:26.120 --> 13:31.640]  against bad training and globalists taking control of the police and the government passing laws
[13:31.640 --> 13:37.160]  that target patriots and then having a bunch of political police that are commasars that come
[13:37.160 --> 13:42.760]  out like the soviet nkvd and persecute the public and that's what they're trying to set up
[13:45.080 --> 13:52.120]  and i tried to get that to not come to fruition and to not unfold now the world has changed yes
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.840]  when i was younger and not a sophisticated i didn't hate the police i felt threatened by the police
[13:56.840 --> 14:04.680]  state i tried to stop it and i came off very aggressively because when i feel threatened i
[14:04.680 --> 14:08.760]  get aggressive especially when i was younger so there's plenty of videos of me screaming at the
[14:08.760 --> 14:16.120]  police and getting in their face and getting arrested and you name it but i didn't do it because
[14:16.120 --> 14:20.760]  i hated them individually i did it because they shouldn't be out there telling us we couldn't
[14:20.760 --> 14:25.160]  demonstrate without a permit in downtown austin and they lost a bunch of lawsuits over it now they
[14:25.160 --> 14:30.040]  don't violate the first amendment and it wasn't about a vendetta against them it was about i'm
[14:30.040 --> 14:35.640]  going to enforce the bill of rights i'm going to police this government that's what i'm supposed to
[14:35.640 --> 14:41.480]  do that's what citizens are supposed to do and then we hire the police to bring criminals to our
[14:41.480 --> 14:47.720]  grand juries and our juries so we can sit in judgment we do the hanging around here we are the
[14:47.720 --> 14:56.920]  people and i'm about usurping that back from the globalist in a good way but digressing too far afield
[14:59.480 --> 15:03.480]  i'm against our police being globalized being taken away from us i'm against our local governments
[15:03.480 --> 15:09.800]  being taken away from us i'm against having our right to control our destiny and to set up our
[15:09.800 --> 15:16.440]  own civilization being destroyed in front of us and watching the police be forged into a weapon
[15:16.440 --> 15:22.600]  against the people and the new world order social engineers have been successful on some fronts
[15:23.800 --> 15:29.560]  but they've been unsuccessful on others and i began about a decade ago to see new world order
[15:29.560 --> 15:36.760]  propaganda to police departments in the military backfire extremely bad and i began to look at
[15:36.760 --> 15:45.240]  statistics and polls that 98 percent of police are pro-gun and over 90 percent have in questionnaires
[15:45.240 --> 15:49.560]  have libertarian leanings and i began to talk to police police have given us a lot of information
[15:49.560 --> 15:56.520]  federal and local jurisdictions and i began to research how communist and globalist overthrow
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.960]  countries how they purge the police and military after they take over how they destabilize civilizations
[16:01.960 --> 16:06.280]  how they create movements like black lives matter and then you look at what soros has been doing for
[16:06.280 --> 16:13.320]  six seven years here domestically decades overseas and it's just totally clear that i don't support
[16:13.320 --> 16:18.280]  a police state but i don't even blame the police themselves we the people have allowed this to
[16:18.280 --> 16:24.120]  unfold and happen and to see the system just scapegoat the police that falls right into the
[16:24.120 --> 16:29.400]  new world order plan and we're not going to reform them playing the part of being their
[16:29.400 --> 16:33.560]  enemy on one side and then they're on the other and then the globalists just control both sides
[16:33.560 --> 16:41.160]  of that equation and create the dialectic they're looking for i'm going to put the information
[16:41.160 --> 16:46.840]  the research together with the facts and present it and say are we all this stupid
[16:46.840 --> 16:51.160]  to fight with each other and act like fools or can we understand how we're being manipulated
[16:51.160 --> 16:57.320]  and come together for the common good of this republic and this planet and this species and
[16:57.320 --> 17:02.440]  turn this around because knowing how we're being manipulated is the answer to reverse all this
[17:02.440 --> 17:13.080]  so i've always supported good peace officers i've always tried to support good police and
[17:13.080 --> 17:19.320]  they're just a police are a maxim for government it's where the rubber meets the road the the real
[17:19.320 --> 17:24.600]  problem is the zoning tyranny and the bureaucratic tyranny and the selective corporate tyranny
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.760]  where they're exempt from the regulations they get congress to pass i mean that's where the real
[17:28.760 --> 17:34.200]  fighting is going on and so we shouldn't let our focus on corrupt government
[17:35.800 --> 17:42.200]  basically be like 90 the police that that's a total diversion like a red cape with a bull
[17:42.200 --> 17:47.240]  and a matador we've got to be smarter than that and the police have got to be smarter than that
[17:47.240 --> 17:54.280]  and i found they are more awake than the public so that's a natural ally to freedom and the republic
[17:54.280 --> 18:00.520]  and that's what makes the globalist so angry at this show it's why they're so hopping mad because
[18:00.520 --> 18:05.480]  i've got their playbook down i know how they operate and i'm educating everybody about how
[18:05.480 --> 18:09.880]  they operate but most people already know this stuff intuitively and when they hear it it just
[18:09.880 --> 18:13.000]  makes sense then they go look up what i'm saying and they find out it's true
[18:18.680 --> 18:23.880]  but now because they're really trying to stampede the public against the police and start a kind of
[18:23.880 --> 18:37.160]  soft civil war in this country i have probably gone even closer to supporting the police across the
[18:37.160 --> 18:45.480]  board because i go against whatever the new world order agenda is just as a default and then
[18:45.480 --> 18:51.240]  intellectually i can see all the reasons for it we're not going to reform the police becoming
[18:51.240 --> 18:57.080]  their enemies and i certainly don't support random shooting of police
[18:59.560 --> 19:05.960]  any more than i support random unstable crazed police officers and there are
[19:06.680 --> 19:10.440]  many of them out there i wouldn't even say a large minority but there's a minority that
[19:11.560 --> 19:15.160]  there's a new video out of a white guy pulled out of his car put down on the ground doesn't
[19:15.160 --> 19:19.240]  resist cop shoots him right in the back of the head and they didn't do anything to the cop
[19:19.240 --> 19:26.600]  and that is tyranny that is wrong uh bare minimum it should be manslaughter and
[19:28.440 --> 19:35.160]  that will end up giving the new world order the ammo it needs with that clear and present
[19:36.680 --> 19:43.800]  injustice to start a civil war in this country the police have to encourage these grand juries
[19:43.800 --> 19:50.600]  to indict bad cops when they execute somebody on video i mean don't be so stupid and so arrogant
[19:50.600 --> 19:55.800]  as to give the globalists the keys to bring this country down you've got to prosecute bad cops you've
[19:55.800 --> 20:06.440]  got to do it earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us have
[20:06.440 --> 20:11.480]  had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing
[20:11.480 --> 20:16.680]  we start with food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage
[20:16.680 --> 20:21.160]  i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider
[20:21.160 --> 20:25.640]  how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the
[20:25.640 --> 20:31.320]  problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another concern

[25:18.280 --> 25:25.960]  mongol groups but china was conquered by british intelligence and the british east india company
[25:25.960 --> 25:35.480]  in a little under a hundred years and then england sold off sectors to more than 12 different nations
[25:35.480 --> 25:41.480]  including the united states spain germany the dutch they all had their own little little
[25:41.480 --> 25:47.480]  management sector and do you know how they took over china and broke it in 14 parts by the end

[26:51.000 --> 27:01.560]  this came out in the 70s in congress would deploy lsd on the streets then in phase two they would
[27:01.560 --> 27:08.760]  teach chemist who were attending the colleges in case they got caught chemistry students and would
[27:08.760 --> 27:17.320]  give them the raw material to produce the money to produce the lsd and then they would even have
[27:17.320 --> 27:23.400]  them sell it and suck the money back into the central intelligence agency that came out in
[27:23.400 --> 27:46.600]  congress our government gave out the recipe for lsd lsd 25 and then put the raw material out
[27:46.600 --> 27:54.760]  and had it produced and had their equivalent freeway rick ross types but it'd be hippie chemist
[27:55.880 --> 28:00.040]  paying them the money the hundreds of millions of dollars they were making in 60s numbers that's
[28:00.040 --> 28:05.800]  billions so you gotta really hand it to them that's what i'm talking about and who is the cia they're

[29:08.920 --> 29:20.120]  to his family in europe what'd he do he had a federal task force and set up the dea and had
[29:20.120 --> 29:27.240]  and had christian groups go around the country to the pta's and preach about the horrors of opium

[30:15.160 --> 30:21.080]  in syria and beyond speaking with ed berliner of newsmax paul stated most of these people do not
[30:21.080 --> 30:26.200]  have the sophistication to make arms so they get the arms from other folks right now isis has over
[30:26.200 --> 30:30.920]  billion dollars worth of us humvees and they have a billion dollars in cash they stole from us so
[30:30.920 --> 30:35.560]  really if we don't want weapons to get into the hands of folks we should be very careful about who
[30:35.560 --> 30:40.840]  we give the weapons to the senator stated paul then elaborated by noting that during the libyan
[30:40.840 --> 30:47.800]  civil war 15 000 shoulder to air missiles made by the united states went missing that's why there
[30:47.800 --> 30:53.960]  is a concern that airliners might be taken down by shoulder to air missiles paul noted here at

[33:29.240 --> 33:34.040]  the drug wars have been used for 300 plus years to take over and corrupt countries
[33:35.400 --> 33:39.960]  china deploys radars drones on border to curb infiltration
[33:41.240 --> 33:45.480]  terrorists and drug smugglers coming in out of india to bat in other areas
[33:45.480 --> 33:54.040]  and then there's another article here uh the drug that make rolls of america's great dynasties
[33:54.680 --> 34:00.040]  ozzy dot com breaks all this down pull it surprise winning journalist west brook peggler
[34:03.080 --> 34:10.360]  and then it breaks down how the big families f dr and others were the top opium and then heroin
[34:10.360 --> 34:15.720]  producers here in the united states but and how they help of course take down china i mean this
[34:15.720 --> 34:20.440]  is mainline history folks have to understand so often i talk about stuff people go that sounds
[34:20.440 --> 34:25.320]  crazy and they go look it up and it's true i'm not making stuff up i mean sometimes i boil
[34:25.320 --> 34:32.440]  stuff down i do a gestalt i get a little something wrong but what we're talking about here is
[34:32.440 --> 34:41.000]  teleprompter free analysis of what's happening on this planet by the way karsten is just
[34:42.360 --> 34:50.440]  combusting spontaneous combustion in front of us then karsten has now admitted fabricating west
[34:50.440 --> 34:57.640]  point scholarship and that he did not receive a west point scholarship that he then basically
[34:57.640 --> 35:06.200]  didn't use and so that's it ben karsen is done people believed in him because he came off as
[35:06.200 --> 35:15.000]  very calm very smart very measured but obviously he is a top brain surgeon has done some of the
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.880]  most amazing surgeries in history i don't know if it was his campaign staff or who you know
[35:19.880 --> 35:28.200]  that put this out but he's done and that only makes donald trump that much stronger
[35:31.800 --> 35:38.040]  it is sad to see this type of stuff but see when somebody has been held up as good and we find
[35:38.040 --> 35:44.120]  they've told some lie it's really hurtful but it's with hillary clinton and and obama and all
[35:44.120 --> 35:49.080]  these people we just expect they're lying crooks and you know we're murdering ambassadors and
[35:49.080 --> 35:53.400]  shipping guns into mexico to blame the second amendment and taking money under the table
[35:53.400 --> 35:59.000]  we just expect it and then it's okay it's kind of it's kind of cute but the democrats are all
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.960]  outraged over karsten right now and just look at the corruption even in their so-called you know
[36:05.880 --> 36:11.160]  you know mr goody tissues and then they get off on the corruption of their own party like it's a sign
[36:11.160 --> 36:20.440]  of masculinist that they're so corrupt you notice though with karsten and people they can actually
[36:20.440 --> 36:27.880]  dig some stuff up with yours truly and i want to cover some of this more later i was just reminded
[36:31.320 --> 36:37.880]  of how many shows not just bill marry yesterday but how many other shows what's the guy's name i
[36:37.880 --> 36:44.760]  want to get an imd being on him yeah yeah yeah david cross of so many hbo shows you name it portlandia
[36:44.760 --> 36:52.520]  mr show comedy central shows i i just came across that again from last year where he put out a movie
[36:53.400 --> 36:59.880]  where there are tea party people running around screaming i hate inwards i hate the jews let's
[36:59.880 --> 37:05.960]  blow up you know let's blow up the government basically because alex jones told me so and it's this
[37:05.960 --> 37:14.520]  tactic that they use where they don't show anything you ever actually said they just put
[37:14.520 --> 37:20.120]  horrible statements in other people's mouths and then attribute it to me comedy central
[37:20.120 --> 37:26.520]  show chides info wars with clone website bill marr chides info wars and then it has my website
[37:26.520 --> 37:32.280]  with a fake headline you know the cancer is good for you msnbc blames boston bombing on
[37:32.280 --> 37:37.560]  deeply racist alex jones bill orally smears alex jones and hate speech rant about sex predators
[37:37.560 --> 37:42.280]  against women there's never even an allegation of that he's the one that settled for sex predator
[37:42.280 --> 37:52.520]  activity you know that's what really makes it rich is that he had to settle and some of it came out
[37:52.520 --> 38:03.320]  before he settled and i mean it was creepy he doesn't even know how to pick women up anyways
[38:05.400 --> 38:13.080]  a piece of work a true piece of work and and the reason i mentioned that is i was just
[38:13.720 --> 38:18.520]  reading news this morning and just happened to see a link to him still traveling around a year
[38:18.520 --> 38:24.200]  later with his movie what's the name of the stupid movie was in theaters it's called what
[38:24.920 --> 38:29.880]  that's right hits and then i learned that he was in austin just a few months ago promoting it
[38:30.840 --> 38:36.280]  at google at a google symposium with google promoting it across their entire platform
[38:37.080 --> 38:41.160]  a film by david cross based on a true story that hasn't happened yet
[38:41.160 --> 38:47.080]  and they've in fact later i want to play a clip of this
[38:48.200 --> 38:54.680]  darin mcgrain did a report on it and i was just thinking about the nerve of him it'd be like if
[38:54.680 --> 39:00.280]  i got up here and said i like to grab children out of their backyards and take them to dungeons
[39:00.280 --> 39:05.240]  and torture them that's what david cross taught me how to do david cross was there with the five
[39:05.240 --> 39:13.160]  year old strapped down with a electrical wire hooked up to a to a generator and we tortured
[39:13.160 --> 39:18.680]  the little kids and david really liked it and david taught me how to cook methamphetamine
[39:18.680 --> 39:24.680]  and sell to school children and david cross did you hear did you hear david cross hates black
[39:24.680 --> 39:30.200]  people and jews yeah he told me they need to be dealt with yeah david cross did you hear about
[39:30.200 --> 39:35.480]  david do you hear about bill o'reilly yeah a sexual predator he wants to hurt women online
[39:37.240 --> 39:43.640]  hey do you hear about uh rachel madow and msnbc and and um they're they're different pundits
[39:43.640 --> 39:49.880]  they're deeply racist and and some of their hosts you know support the boston bombing i mean this is
[39:49.880 --> 39:55.240]  of course i'm saying that in context i that's not true i don't believe that i'm showing what it's
[39:55.240 --> 40:02.440]  like how would you like that and by the way you don't hurt me doing that scumbags you just hit me
[40:02.440 --> 40:08.920]  how much i take and i shouldn't take it lying down i know they're trash i know they're filth i
[40:08.920 --> 40:14.040]  know they prey on their stupid audiences but i should make a bigger deal out of the things they do
[40:15.480 --> 40:19.960]  and i i'm gonna check with some lawyers and people but i think i'm gonna put out some reports on
[40:19.960 --> 40:27.240]  these people that are fictitious but do it with a straight face and just put out the most horrible
[40:27.240 --> 40:31.560]  stuff you can imagine and then when they get upset about it but i mean really effective stuff
[40:32.440 --> 40:36.520]  i might go to their neighborhoods and put a thousand flyers on people's doors you know that
[40:36.520 --> 40:40.200]  kind of stuff and then when they get upset i'll go well you did it on national tv
[40:42.520 --> 40:49.000]  you put up a screen saying look at this website of alex jones and it's my website looks like our
[40:49.000 --> 40:56.680]  real headline saying cancer is good for you but that's nothing compared to having people stand up at
[40:56.680 --> 41:03.560]  fake city councils going i hate the n words and i hate jews and and all this stuff and i and i learned
[41:03.560 --> 41:11.240]  this all from alex jones i mean these aren't leftist these are sick evil people i can play bill mar
[41:11.240 --> 41:15.720]  saying he wants to kill people he wants dead people he hates you he wants everybody to commit
[41:15.720 --> 41:21.320]  suicide so he has an open highway to drive down hey bill mar the highway got built by masses of people
[41:21.320 --> 41:26.280]  we build these like coral reefs are built by coral it's like you don't want any coral or fish at
[41:26.280 --> 41:31.080]  the coral reef so you can be the only fish you'd starve to death you damn vampire
[41:33.640 --> 41:38.920]  but it was just really hitting me that if they'll do this now they could do anything
[41:38.920 --> 41:49.560]  if they've been green lighted by the legal at hbo and cnn and msnbc because this is only a symbol
[41:49.560 --> 41:58.040]  of what they're doing to us this is only a small portion they can get away with anything
[41:59.240 --> 42:03.480]  but then i started thinking we ought to be really glad about this because the fact that they have to
[42:03.480 --> 42:11.880]  engage in several magnitudes worse than classical yellow journalism levels of disinformation
[42:12.840 --> 42:18.200]  that actually only make us look credible with thinking people the problem is they are trying
[42:18.200 --> 42:24.280]  to inoculate the population that hasn't heard of info wars yet with operant conditioning like
[42:24.280 --> 42:29.480]  showing you a picture of pumpkin pie and then shocking you until the next time you see pumpkin
[42:29.480 --> 42:37.320]  pie you you throw up and recoil and fear that's what they're doing they are engaged in conditioning
[42:39.640 --> 42:45.080]  they are engaged in creating a painful stimulus and then connecting it to yours truly because
[42:45.080 --> 42:48.920]  they're so afraid of us and everybody ought to be asking the question why are they so afraid of
[42:48.920 --> 42:58.120]  info wars dot com and they they they do similar stuff uh to matt drudge they do the same stuff to
[42:58.120 --> 43:01.960]  us they'll just announce there's a virus on info wars if you go there you'll get viruses none of
[43:01.960 --> 43:11.960]  its true that's a uh annual report that the media puts out but they'll also just sit there and say
[43:11.960 --> 43:16.280]  alex jones is a liar there are no domestic drones alex jones is a liar there are no side effects
[43:16.280 --> 43:22.840]  of vaccines alex jones is a liar there are no um penalties under obama care but anyone who has a
[43:22.840 --> 43:29.000]  brain goes well yeah there are that's what i mean though i mean they're dumbing the the public down
[43:29.000 --> 43:35.320]  with the message they are polluting things with just total garbage but doesn't matter because
[43:35.320 --> 43:40.520]  you're drowning in it there there's so many i mean you know you're in a vat of turds and i'm sorry
[43:40.520 --> 43:47.000]  to use a gross analogy but that's what it is you know you're in a giant porta potty the size of a
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.880]  sports stadium floating around with al gore and hillary clinton and michael moore and you know
[43:51.880 --> 43:58.760]  what they are but there's just so many of them and they've got the central banks just funding
[43:58.760 --> 44:04.600]  the sky raining more on you you know it's just just unlimited funding with everyone looking
[44:04.600 --> 44:10.520]  outraged and crying in houston with straight faces we can't have men in the women's bathrooms now
[44:10.520 --> 44:16.440]  can you believe it you know foreign banks are raping everything world government 40 something
[44:16.440 --> 44:21.240]  million are starving a year just neurological disorders and cancer are off the charts world
[44:21.240 --> 44:24.440]  governments being announced the tpp's been rammed through worse than we thought
[44:26.840 --> 44:30.040]  total illegal surveillance the government runs al qaeda in ices
[44:31.880 --> 44:34.840]  and you've got the white house press secretary let's play a club of this
[44:36.200 --> 44:45.000]  just very upset that yes it's a national issue houston didn't approve men being able to go in
[44:45.000 --> 44:54.360]  women's dressing rooms at clubs exercise facilities uh in pe from fifth grade excuse me from from
[44:54.360 --> 45:00.600]  from h5 first grade up yes it's true the boys can't go in the girls bathroom it's just incredible
[45:00.600 --> 45:03.320]  can you believe it they'll be all these movies made and
[45:03.320 --> 45:13.720]  in just a battle for civil rights so important right now
[45:15.080 --> 45:19.640]  because if they can sell that they can sell anything what a joke they take the fact that
[45:19.640 --> 45:23.480]  we have such a good will that we're such an open society when they look at us with a straight face
[45:23.480 --> 45:29.080]  and say you're going to take three million radical muslim refugees and you're going to pay for it
[45:29.080 --> 45:38.520]  germany and america you are too racist and they have illegals flip us off on tv and laugh at us
[45:39.160 --> 45:45.080]  it's all just part of rubbing our nose and laughing at us let's go to the club here it is
[45:46.200 --> 45:49.640]  great just this for the election results this week was the defeat of a
[45:49.640 --> 45:54.920]  non-discrimination ordinance in the nation's fourth largest city houston uh that was uh
[45:54.920 --> 45:59.160]  for which the vice president the president indicated support the president of reaction upon the news
[45:59.160 --> 46:04.440]  that it had been defeated well chris i haven't spoken to the president about the this particular
[46:04.440 --> 46:08.600]  election result i'll just say as a as a general matter the administration certainly believes
[46:09.720 --> 46:20.920]  that preventing discrimination for american citizens because of their race or their gender
[46:20.920 --> 46:24.840]  or their ethnicity or their religion or who they love is something that we should take
[46:24.840 --> 46:30.920]  steps how you bring a country to prevent this is cultural sabotage particularly when it comes to
[46:32.200 --> 46:37.800]  the rights of lgbt americans this country's made tremendous progress over the last several years
[46:38.920 --> 46:45.480]  you know and some of that was was progress that was uh moved along by uh policy decisions made
[46:45.480 --> 46:51.080]  by this administration i think what is clear is that the opponents of this particular ordinance in
[46:51.080 --> 46:59.160]  houston um were much more interested on a uh political tactic that diverted attention
[46:59.160 --> 47:05.800]  from the true intent of the ordinance uh and all right that's enough to shut him off no if you can
[47:06.840 --> 47:12.040]  let 10 year old boys go in the girls restroom or go in the showers with them understand
[47:12.040 --> 47:16.440]  them this is you go to say 24 hour fitness in houston
[47:18.920 --> 47:26.200]  or the ymca whatever it is and you walk into the women's restroom and you go in the showers
[47:26.200 --> 47:32.520]  by women with your pants off used to that was called basically sexual assault the beginning of sexual
[47:32.520 --> 47:46.120]  assault not now oh but in this free open society you can't play dodgeball or you are many schools
[47:46.120 --> 47:50.360]  just gotten rid of p all together or or gotten rid of recess because somebody might get hurt
[47:50.360 --> 47:55.720]  oh you no one can have recess and you can't have a nerf gun in your backyard of the police get called
[47:57.480 --> 48:01.400]  and you got to get rid of all the diving boards because we're so free and the nsa spying on us
[48:01.400 --> 48:03.160]  but don't you worry
[48:06.120 --> 48:09.080]  i mean it took me some getting used to when i got into sports
[48:10.520 --> 48:13.640]  when i was about nine in swim team i i started swimming late
[48:15.160 --> 48:18.440]  wish i'd stayed this one by the time i was 13 i was winning city wide blue ribbons
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.880]  and i was like my daughter is like top on the top one say that people get her name on the top
[48:23.880 --> 48:29.160]  in the city of austin i'm just blessed with being a good swimmer and i was 13 didn't want to do it
[48:29.160 --> 48:32.600]  anymore i wish my parents would have made me but i remember being like nine and then pulling you
[48:32.600 --> 48:36.200]  know pulling my clothes off getting dressed put the speed on after taking my clothes off going
[48:36.200 --> 48:40.120]  and showering you know teenage guys in there it was kind of intimidating you're nine there's like
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.760]  you know 14 15 year olds in there for a boy it was intimidating and i had to get over it
[48:48.760 --> 48:53.000]  i remember being on swim team stuff but also being in football locker rooms when you're
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.680]  at an away place you got to go to the bathroom and they got toilets right next to each other
[48:56.680 --> 49:00.280]  with no stall doors i mean you got to sit down right there with other men around you
[49:01.320 --> 49:05.160]  other teenagers around you and just take a dump and i'm not trying to get into a whole
[49:05.160 --> 49:09.720]  scatological discussion today but i'm trying to get down to brass tax here it's uncomfortable
[49:09.720 --> 49:12.680]  you got to get used to that now as a man i could care less at 42
[49:15.320 --> 49:21.000]  you just get desensitized but not little kids and it's about jacking with them folks i mean
[49:21.000 --> 49:26.840]  can you imagine being a woman and some guy i mean i saw one of these transsexuals that was
[49:26.840 --> 49:32.840]  the boyfriend of of leslie cocker in the famous bearded training in austin who was just like a
[49:32.840 --> 49:36.840]  horrible zombie creature i mean i'm sorry he was just the most disgusting person i've ever seen
[49:37.800 --> 49:41.960]  very sad person and and they were at access television

[49:59.720 --> 50:04.280]  there and they would go in the women's bathroom and they'd be like black church ladies one time
[50:04.280 --> 50:07.720]  or in the bathroom putting their makeup on with their church show they all come out and get freaked
[50:07.720 --> 50:13.720]  out and leslie's stumbling around going i'll go in that effin bathroom i want and there was like

[55:18.040 --> 55:22.280]  something really ugly and see the beauty in it i'm sophisticated enough to do that that's not what
[55:22.280 --> 55:28.360]  it's meant to do to the general public and the cia declassified why they did it and it concurs with
[55:28.360 --> 55:35.480]  what i just said understand it's not my perspective it's a fact john lott one of the top living

[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.920]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:35.640]  he was on with us i guess about six months ago he's the professor he's the doctor
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:42.680]  he is the one of the top statisticians in the world i mean not just on guns he's hired by
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:48.440]  top companies he's recognized as one of the best statisticians on the planet uh john lot crime
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:54.440]  research dot org he told us what was going on six months ago i'm going for memory let's see if my
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.400]  memory's right let's look it up please gotta keep checking my memory or it'll fail and
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:10.600]  he found that crime using guns dropped not guns committing crimes you notice criminals using
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:16.840]  guns that type of crime dropped 61 percent again i just went with just department numbers of 51
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.240]  it doesn't surprise me that they've cooked them down but whatever let's just not argue a point
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.360]  he said the big assault is coming and he was right
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.360]  this is the next big push for our guns and by the way just because we've been winning some
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.920]  battles don't think we're winning the war we are in the fight as i've said thousands of times but
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:45.000]  we are not winning we've come from behind a lot but the minute we start thinking we've got this game
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.760]  in the bag is the minute we're going to get hurt bad now is the time to really get serious really
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:56.200]  get focused and realize it's for all the marbles and think about your family you're right he was on
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:05.240]  about six months ago he's on six months ago thanks April 27th April 27th so this is an epic battle
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.480]  and i think what's happening i know what's happening is people now are really getting
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:15.400]  we're being conquered by foreign megabanks and by the way their philosophy is enslaving us making
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:23.160]  us dumb and then phasing us out and that kind of as a race consciousness level humans are the race
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.480]  we are brothers and sisters together i don't care what color we are what coat of paint we got
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.000]  we all have similar backgrounds our ancestors all went through the exact same type of crap
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.960]  if i don't want things that people are people sure certain groups have certain traits culturally
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:49.720]  and things but at the end of the day at the at the medium average person people are people
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:57.320]  and humans really aren't lazy as so much as if something's complex they'll tune out of it until
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.640]  it overwhelms them then they'll start assessing the situation and do something about it and the
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:07.320]  social engineers want to get us in a position wrapped up in a cultural spiderweb that by the
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:15.880]  time we wake up we're basically already dead well here's the deal i'm not dead you're not dead
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:22.920]  but the enemy has done is so ridiculously outrageous it's hard to beat because it's
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:29.960]  just so over the top at one level at another level it's easy to beat because it's so over the top
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:36.200]  but you got to meet the radical activity with radical response not that we're being radical
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:41.400]  or making something up it's that it is radical to respond to these people because only radical
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:48.120]  means will deal with them because they are radical they're not negotiating with us they're not gonna
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:54.280]  back off with us they're not gonna stop their plan they hate us this is about dominating and
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:04:01.240]  controlling humanity this is about conquering the species they want to mount our head over their
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:08.520]  dining hall they want this they want the heavyweight champion belt they want the super bowl trophy
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:13.560]  they fight in the war that really matters they want to control our genetics say when we can have
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:21.240]  kids decide what humanity does they want to end free will and you get a bunch of fake pseudo
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:27.320]  intellectuals making movies about how i don't like black people and say the n word
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.960]  that's all you got but when i'm just trying to save myself my family and humanity
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.000]  and you people sit around like pseudo intellectuals and engage in this type of criminal
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.800]  garbage against your viewers i'm not even angry at you i just look at how pathetic you are
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.880]  and how you get these walking orders and you actually engage in this
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.160]  we're gonna beat you i know it
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:06.200]  republican candidates call for war republicans want intervention in syria iraq and libya article

[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:30.280]  network i've got two different articles here that really give you a bird's eye view into what's
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:44.200]  going on nfl says it will pay back the pentagon for patriotic halftime shows that stirring multi
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:49.240]  million dollar display of patriotism you saw at halftime was brought to you by you the taxpayer
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.000]  and that story is up on info wars dot com now of course if you're a regular listener this is old
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.760]  news and again i'm not against the military i'm not against patriotic displays obviously
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.960]  but it's fake whenever they make a basket then they just cut the troops in uniform
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.360]  that was product placement that was propaganda placement you were paying for it
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:22.520]  now quite frankly the military has a budget to get people to become recruited and join the arm
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:30.120]  services so i don't even so much have a problem with this if it's admittedly sponsored but see
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:36.040]  it's unseemly it's embarrassing to think that they had to be paid to do something like this
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:43.080]  but a story like this you can get people to then think about it and go wait a minute
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:49.640]  what else is paid for well we could play the former attorney general speaking to the national
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.400]  rtf convention saying we need to brainwash the public against the second amendment
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:03.400]  billions and billions are spent and and much of it is secretive to engage in domestic propaganda
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:11.080]  and most of it is promoting transgender bathrooms anti-gun garbage open border propaganda your
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.120]  taxpayer money is being spent i'll never forget news core even put out a video four or five years
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.760]  ago we played several times to the stockholders bragging about how they promote global warming
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:28.440]  and carbon taxes and anti-gun stuff on their fox tv platform then they have the conservative market
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.080]  over here and so i'm just saying become aware of this and i know you're aware of it but get
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.480]  your friends and family to become aware of it because once you're aware of it i knew the number
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:43.800]  and then our guests this year were going to him i knew what was it five super bowls ago when they
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:49.480]  had the green police said that that was paid for by government at some level to get people ready
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.160]  for the new green police to take you to jail if your hot tubs too hot or you're using too much
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.120]  energy or you're have the wrong light bulbs or the wrong emissions notice it was an outie commercial
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.360]  caught faking stuff with false wagon faking emissions and then the mayor of san francisco came out
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:11.480]  with the head pr company there and admitted that government had been involved funding
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:18.120]  that to prepare the public for what was coming and under federal grants the uniforms they were wearing
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:23.240]  i knew it when i saw it white and green globally that's the uniform of the green police from
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:31.640]  australia to the united states see this is global standardization folks it's super creepy it's total
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.840]  conditioning and now we have bill marr putting up info wars dot com and putting the subhead
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:46.760]  line two nights ago cancer doesn't hurt you alex jones says this is the type of deception they
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:53.160]  engage in or they have a major movie out we talked about earlier that google sponsoring
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.920]  where they say alex jones doesn't like black people with no proof this is the type of dirty
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:02.680]  trick and we're not just doing it to me they're doing it to gun owners saying you're to blame
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:08.200]  when someone's killed now joining us and i really appreciate him coming on in his busy schedule crime
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:15.880]  research dot or g is dr john lott professor he's an economist world-renowned expert on guns and
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:21.240]  crime but also hired by a lot of top companies out there for just other number crunching and
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:29.800]  nobel laureate nilton freedman noted that john lot has few equals as a perceptive analyst and
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:35.560]  an controversial public policy issues he's one of the most productive and side economist in the
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:40.760]  world and i'm not going to get into all that but he is he is a statistician statistician
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:44.600]  and an economist economist so maybe we get into the economy with him too and the limited time we
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.720]  have with him here today and before we get into the attack on guns that he predicted six months
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.680]  ago here on the show that a new wave was coming of fake data which we now see and product placement
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:59.640]  propaganda placement behavior placements what the government calls it i want to just
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:06.520]  segue back just into the general world today what he sees in politics what candidates he likes
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:12.200]  professor lot thanks for coming on with us well thanks for having me on a state of the world i mean
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:18.280]  just as a person as an american what is your overall sense of things i mean are people waking up
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.240]  are the are the kleptocrats in trouble or how do you see this as a football game right now who's
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:32.520]  winning well i mean i think a lot's going to be determined over the next year uh right now the
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:39.880]  supreme court is very evenly divided uh if you look at the recent cases that we've had and uh the
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:48.200]  dc uh and chicago gun cases where complete bands and guns were struck down as too extreme but
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:54.280]  the supreme court you had five to four decisions but two of the justices on the five side are
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:00.760]  are 80 years old and there's no way they're going to make it another four years and truly
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:06.840]  not another eight years if you have a democratic president and if you have one or both of those
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:12.120]  individuals get replaced with people who are similar to the ones the democrats have already
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:19.160]  put on the supreme court you're going to end up with them reversing those earlier wins uh the four
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:24.520]  democratic appointees on the supreme court do not believe that there's an individual right to
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:31.400]  self-defense well on an individual right to using a gun for self-defense and um you're going to see
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:39.480]  a major change in uh how they interpret the second amendment but beyond that you have huge amounts
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:45.960]  of money they're being spent uh bloomberg spending 50 million dollars a year on every town uh i don't
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:53.160]  know exactly how many tens or millions more he's spending on on other types of activities like funding
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:15:02.600]  university research or uh he gives money to get a school of care that they can uh
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:12.440]  there are laws surrounding how to deal with with you but you know very now
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.840]  I know that you fund researchers that uh agree with him and then he trains journalists on how
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:27.080]  to cover the issue and then he has a lot of money being spent on on the political end of
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:33.800]  50 million dollars a year but it's just not him you have george soros you have 23 large health
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:41.400]  foundations that uh we're deeply involved in pushing obama care and the president done 2013
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.360]  met with them and said look we've won the health care debate it's time to focus on another issue so
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:51.880]  those foundations that spend any place from two and a half to 10 million dollars or so a year
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:59.320]  are now spending it on gun control issues and so of course you have president obama is using
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:05.400]  many resources with the federal government to push these things so a lot's being done there now
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.840]  that doesn't mean everything's bad on the other hand you've had a lot of states that have moved
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:16.840]  towards uh making it easier for people to be able to go and defend themselves uh you have some states
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:24.920]  so like maryland and new jersey and california and uh new york and connecticut places like that
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:32.040]  which are becoming more restrictive um one of the big pushes these days has been to try to put
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:40.360]  fees uh or taxes on people's ability to obtain a gun so um and that's basically tied in with these
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:47.400]  universal background checks uh in new york that adds about 80 dollars onto the cost of transferring
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:55.080]  a gun in washington state it adds about 60 dollars uh in oregon it adds 50 some dollars onto the
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:01.720]  cost of transferring a gun uh but that's not the only approach in someplace like maryland for
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:08.840]  example uh in 2013 they passed licensing and registration of handguns so license and register
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:17.000]  one handgun uh cost you about 300 dollars and so my belief is that the main reason why they're pushing
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:24.280]  for these implicit taxes is uh is to try to reduce gun ownership and particularly reduce it among
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:30.360]  poor individuals particularly disproportionately poor blacks who live in high crime urban areas
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:36.520]  well sure they admit they're trying to remove the guns from the people um but as you said six
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:43.160]  months ago a new wave a new push is coming but it seems like the new pushes only wakes the public
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:51.400]  up that much faster well you know i i suppose it does to some extent but a lot of these studies
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:57.080]  get very uncritical coverage when bloom burrows new every town comes out with a new study you'll
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:03.400]  find you know a couple or a few thousand news reports across the country and uh they're completely
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:12.200]  uncritical it's like giving them pre advertising there and um uh i worry that it has an impact on
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:18.520]  people's perceptions of guns and in particular i worry that it causes people to take less safe
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:25.480]  options if you convince somebody not to own guns in the home when in fact owning guns are the way
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:32.920]  that will make people safer uh you know you put lives at risk let's elaborate on that because
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.960]  we have a lot of new affiliates a lot of new listeners every few seconds that tune in the
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:44.040]  well-established fact as your book title uh details more guns less crime
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.160]  right well look just as you can deter criminals with higher arrest rates or higher conviction
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.360]  rates or longer prison sentences the fact that it would be victim might be able to go and defend
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:02.120]  themselves can also make it risky for criminals to go and commit crimes and deter some of them
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:08.520]  from engaging in it having a gun is by far the safest course of action for people to take when
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:15.000]  they're confronted by a criminal that's particularly true for two groups of people it's particularly
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:21.880]  true for people who are relatively weaker physically women and the elderly uh a presence of a gun
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:26.600]  represents a much bigger relative change in a woman's ability to go and protect herself than
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:33.080]  does for a man you're talking about usually young male criminals and violent attacks and the strength
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:39.320]  differential between a man attacking a woman is much larger than a man attacking another man
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:43.400]  and the guns the equalizer why aren't the feminists pushing guns for women
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:51.880]  well that's a good question uh you know you look generally the big if you look at surveys the one
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:57.880]  issue that most differentiate liberals and conservatives isn't abortion it isn't taxes
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:06.120]  it's gun control uh and uh i think part of that has to do with who you think should run your life
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:12.840]  whether it be health care or other issues uh a lot of democrats seem to believe that um uh the
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:17.880]  government needs to go and tell you exactly what type of health policy you should have health
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:24.760]  insurance policy you know exactly what's covered uh it seems like conservatives are more willing to
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:33.000]  let individuals make those types of decisions but we're doing something like um gun owners
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.840]  and some tend to be all professor lot your your your phone's breaking up i think you may have
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:43.160]  gotten away from the hub or digitally it's having a problem we're gonna go back to you in just a
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:49.720]  moment also major democratic publications just this week have come out and said they're worried
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:55.480]  that hillary's open calls for confiscation australian style might cause a civil war daily beast
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:04.200]  obama hillary toying with civil war over gun confiscation and so i think this phone may be
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:10.680]  back by now uh specifically professor lot again the author of more guns less crime
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:16.520]  professor john lot crime research dot org is our guest i don't want a revolution i don't want a war
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.320]  but if persecution against gun owners continues if obama does an executive order tries to ban
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.560]  semi-auto people keep thinking he won't do that he's making noises people didn't think we'd have
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:31.000]  obama care either or just open borders outside of law or that he'd be shutting power plants down
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.200]  outside of law or that he'd be signing secret treaties or that he'd be funding isis and getting
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:41.640]  caught now so we are living in the age of their attempt to take over are they arrogant enough
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:48.520]  to try a frontal assault because even again the democrats even the daily beast is scared and says
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:53.400]  hey you're admitting you want to take them we're not supposed to tell them our plan is to take them
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.720]  that upsets them too much i mean they actually say that in the article they say we got to creep
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:01.880]  up at you know in the dead of night and do this incrementally but i guess once you get to a certain
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:05.800]  point that they've got to just be more honest about what their plan is what do you think about
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:13.160]  those discussions well i don't think they're gonna ban all semi-automatic guns the most guns sold
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:18.840]  the united states or semi-automatic guns i think what some of the things that are happening are
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:25.080]  there's discussions about making so that individuals on social security that are having
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:34.040]  help with their finances may end up being classified as mentally defective sure and uh and
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:41.560]  therefore prevented from owning guns and you're so for example my mom who's in her 80s uh doesn't
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:45.960]  use the computer she doesn't know how to use it doesn't want to use it she's given my sister power
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:54.600]  of attorney to go and pay her bills and uh but under the discussion discussed rules that the
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:01.320]  obama administration's been having uh she would be classified as uh mentally defective and therefore
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:07.560]  not be allowed to own a gun and as i just mentioned somebody like my mom who's in her 80s
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:14.040]  fairly weak physically uh is exactly the type of individuals who benefits a lot from having
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.960]  the option to use a gun for protection and statistics show the elderly are some of the
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:23.080]  safest people with guns they don't commit crimes they don't hurt anybody i mean they're one of the
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:31.000]  most innocent good groups why would you target them it is so evil the FBI actually said that quote
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.120]  we're looking at the VA's algorithm if you get automatic money transfer which is what the VA
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:41.720]  basically demands people do we learned then we're going to declare you incompetent outside of a court
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:48.200]  of law they just have some computer program that does it some bioethics computer i mean this talk
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:57.800]  about rule of thx 1138 right well i mean they essentially will put down some rule rather than
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:03.640]  going to court and that's hopefully going to be challenged and fought out but uh president obama
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:10.680]  has appointed about half the federal judges in this country and as i say uh we're facing a battle
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:16.520]  for control of the supreme court that's there uh over the next year or so and uh you know who knows
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:22.760]  what they may decide on that type of issue but uh you know you've already had several hundred thousand
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:28.840]  veterans who under those types of rules have had their names put into the national instant
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:34.520]  background check system and are denied the right to be able to go and buy a gun because of those
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:40.360]  types of rule let me expand on that with you matt drudge a month ago was here in studio with us
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.040]  an exclusive interview that we reared yesterday because it was so popular but he told me the
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.120]  name specifically and and the details and it was even more frightening than what he's told people
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.760]  on air but i'm not allowed to repeat it just come to the paradox of being a reporter not being able
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:25:04.200]  to report things but at a event a private event with some who's who's he's there with this top
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.000]  high level supreme court justice leave it at and some other people too from the government
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:14.440]  and they said no the democrats admit they're coming after free speech in 2016
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:21.080]  that they've got the votes they've got the people and you think they've been bad on whistleblowers
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:26.760]  so far the press we're you know they're going after the internet they're going after drudge
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:31.000]  they're going after free speech and now they're even suddenly making the rumblings in the news
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:35.400]  so they're not just going after the second amendment we obviously need the first to defend
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:41.400]  the second and then vice versa i think we need to raise our rhetoric to really point out we're
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.640]  dealing with a totalitarian takeover professor lotan people that have to grab a toss like you do
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:50.200]  out there a lot of folks that respect you i respect you but you also have been very measured in what
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:55.960]  you say and do but do you agree that the fact that of what i'm saying what drudge is saying this is a
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:04.840]  very totalitarian climate we're starting to enter yeah i'm trying to use the totalitarian but
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:12.600]  it's here and then we're gonna have to pause again sir your phone cut out again it'll come back
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:17.240]  in about three seconds uh the wonders of digital communications who's gonna come back in just a
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:25.080]  moment um i'm sorry dr lot i think you're back down go ahead yeah i'm sorry i hear you fine look
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:32.840]  i'm sorry if my phone it's okay it's okay i'm on a landline but the uh look um i think the real
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:38.440]  issue is one of safety that most people in the middle of the debate can understand and
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.560]  that's the reason why i think most gun control advocates talk about you know reasonable laws
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:50.040]  for safety you know obviously you and i don't think that they're reasonable laws but um but the
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:56.200]  problem is is that when you raise the cost of guns when you make it so that certain people like elderly
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:01.880]  are banned from being able to own a gun or veterans uh because of the way the obama administration
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:08.600]  wants to find uh mental illness uh you know you're talking about making so that people aren't able
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:15.880]  to go and defend themselves and realize they care and yeah and look uh when you're talking about
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:21.720]  three hundred dollars to license and register a handgun in maryland just look earlier this year
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:28.440]  where you had orders to the police to stand down and not stop the riots in the poor heavily black
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:33.720]  parts of the city that were there we're making so that the police can't defend these individuals
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:38.760]  or they surely can't depend upon the police to defend them and we're also making it because
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:44.680]  of these high fees that the mayor ordered a standout called for them to defend themselves right
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:49.320]  i mean that is so criminal in my view and you're absolutely right how can the court say the police
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:54.600]  have no duty to protect us obviously they don't and they can't all the time they try to and and then
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.720]  tell us we can't have guns what a fundamental form of discrimination uh again the dredge pointed out
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:05.320]  that these people are all armed they've got bodyguards from michael more to barack obama to his
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.640]  kids at school have you know all these armed bodyguards but they have the nerve to say somebody
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:16.040]  in chicago shouldn't be able to have a gun professor that is just outrageous sure well i mean michael
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:23.320]  bloomberg has uh armed bodyguards um one can go through the list of people at his every town group
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:30.280]  uh that have armed bodyguards so uh clearly they understand the benefit of guns for protection
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:36.200]  it's just that they think that only the extremely wealthy or politically well connected individuals
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:42.200]  should have it when you look at places that allow concealed carry but restrict it so that you have
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:47.400]  to go and get permission these so-called may issue places like new york city you have a few
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:54.680]  thousand people that have permits but they're basically union leaders they're uh some very well
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:29:01.400]  placed media types uh they may be arthur scholesberger the head of uh the publisher for the new york
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:08.280]  times has had a permit uh you know those individuals uh those very powerful individuals are able to
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:15.880]  get permission to have it but some poor businessman who works in harlem or somebody who lives in a
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:21.240]  particularly dangerous area in new york city uh they're not going to be allowed to be able to
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:25.000]  protect themselves well remember when they freaked out a month ago that trump admitted he had a
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.520]  permit like it was bad that a billionaire a major target of kidnapping and crime had a gun i mean
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.560]  and then they but they're fine with other rich people having guns it's so it's not just that
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:39.800]  only poor people can't have them now rich people that they don't agree with can't have a professor
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:45.320]  lot stay there i want to talk about statistics what guns are doing to make us safer straight ahead
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:54.680]  we'll be right back we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:04.040]  ran paul look where isis gets its weapons from they have anti-tank weapons and missiles that
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:09.640]  we gave them article by steve watson presidential candidate ron paul has urged voters to look to
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:14.440]  where isis is getting its weapons from to understand the monumental problem the us is
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:20.280]  facilitating in syria and beyond speaking with ed brliner of newsmax paul stated most of these
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:25.320]  people do not have the sophistication to make arms so they get the arms from other folks right now
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:29.640]  isis has over a billion dollars worth of us humbees and they have a billion dollars in cash
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:34.280]  they stole from us so really if we don't want weapons to get into the hands of folks we should
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:39.800]  be very careful about who we give the weapons to the senator stated paul then elaborated by noting
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:46.840]  that during the libyan civil war 15 000 shoulder-to-air missiles made by the united states went missing
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:52.920]  that's why there is a concern that airliners might be taken down by shoulder-to-air missiles

[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.840]  sued them or threatened to sue and got those thousands of pages of documents from the clinton
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:22.520]  library it was 1993 and they said we've got to stop a new media coming up libertarian or
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:27.320]  conservative or any other on the internet we've got to call them all conspiracy theorists we can't

[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:14.120]  john lot crimeresearch.org 800-259-9231 i want to go to calls in about five minutes but i've been
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.520]  asking some of the questions here today you're really at the heart of exposing what's happening
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:23.320]  statistically but also politically uh what are the latest statistics what are some other
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:27.560]  numbers we should know about what are some other issues that i haven't raised that people should
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:34.440]  be alerted to professor well that's probably the biggest debate that's coming up is are these
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:39.080]  universal background checks we've talked about part of the issue with regard to them and that is
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:45.800]  that it's being used as uh as a way of making it more costly for people to get guns before i kind
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:51.400]  of get into the statistical stuff i just want to make one aspect of that first point clear and that
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:57.240]  is if you look over the last few years i've been involved in some of the political debates behind
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:05.320]  the scenes in colorado for example where they passed the universal background check in 2013 um they
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:11.560]  have both a state tax on the transfer of a gun as well as you have to pay a federally licensed
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:19.800]  dealer to handle the transfer and we had the idea of having an amendment there that would exempt
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:25.880]  people below the poverty level from having to pay the state tax uh the democrats except for two pro
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:32.520]  gun democrats voted in mass against exempting people below the poverty level from having to pay
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:38.520]  that tax that is so sensational we meant i mean that's like the poll tax on black people so they
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:44.600]  couldn't vote i mean that is so discriminatory how do they get away with that right well that
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:50.440]  is why i'm talking about it now in part uh to let people know because i mean how many taxes
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:55.320]  can you think of that democrats would vote in mass against exempting people below the poverty
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:40:00.280]  level from having to pay unbelievable you know it's not clear to be clear to them that the primary
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:06.440]  impact is i'm going to stop you or myself from being able to get a gun but it mainly will stop
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:11.880]  poor people particularly poor minorities who are most likely be victims of violent crime
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:17.560]  from having the option to go and defend themselves and it's just not colorado and maryland um when
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:24.840]  they passed the licensing and registration in 2013 well 300 there was a similar attempt to try to
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:30.440]  exempt people below the poverty level from having to bear those costs in the sense that democrats
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:35.560]  controlled over two-thirds of both the state house the state senate they wouldn't even let the amendments
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:42.920]  come up for a vote and so you know how much clearer can you be that the main point of it is
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:49.080]  to try to stop people from being able to have guns i mean if it was just an issue of solving crime
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:55.480]  which i don't think it does uh you know they would say well you know these poor people will
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:01.560]  exempt them or will pay for it out of general revenue that's a that's a basic point there is
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:07.800]  is an economist i would say that if you have a government service that's benefiting everybody
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:12.680]  then everybody should pay for it you shouldn't just make it so that it's the law-abiding good
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:18.280]  citizens who you really have the least amount to worry about but the law-abiding individuals who
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:24.520]  go through these background checks shouldn't be the ones who have to bear the entire burden
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:31.960]  of of running this system but as far as the statistics go with regard to these background
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:37.480]  checks one thing people really need to understand is how much of a mess the current system is
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:44.600]  it looks like over 99 percent of the denials that occur from the current background checks system
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:51.080]  are law-abiding citizens who should have been able to legally buy a gun but were stopped because they
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:58.200]  had a name similar to someone that the government wanted to stop and so you know when the president
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:04.760]  goes and says that there've been over two million prohibited or dangerous people who have been stopped
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:10.040]  from buying guns because of background checks that's simply false what he should say is that
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:15.720]  there've been over two million initial denials just because you stopped somebody who has a name
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.200]  similar to a felon doesn't mean you're stopping a felon from being able to go and buy a gun
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:29.720]  so an analogy would be um the late senator ted kennedy from mass tuesday five tried to buy
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:40.760]  or he would buy him without a note because if that is similar to him it will apply as soon as
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:45.640]  your phone's doing it again sir it's it's okay it's gonna come right back it actually adds to the
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.760]  to the radio theater for our listeners out there we also of course have tv viewers professor
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.800]  john lott is our guest you need to go to his website get the crime statistics crime research.org
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:01.960]  it's not just his statistics his statistics time after time get matched up with the crime
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:06.600]  statistics and proven to be deadly accurate uh so we're talking 50 plus percent drop in violent
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:12.200]  crime the justice department says lot says it's more like 61 percent this great truth is coming
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:16.280]  out so we're winning the hearts and minds it's like on abortion the problem is they're just
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.000]  moving forward it's like obama care is unpopular and and and horrible but we can't get rid of it
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.360]  for some reason uh so we're talking about this fight uh right now i'm sorry professor lot your
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:34.600]  phone broke up again you're back go ahead yeah oh sorry well i mean so the thing is i assume the
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:39.560]  president won't count the five times that senator kennedy was stopped from flying as five times we
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:45.480]  stopped terrorists from flying uh but that's the way since so they count these numbers when we're
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:51.560]  talking about the gun background checks and and and the problem is is that while for most individuals
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:56.840]  it may simply be a big inconvenience to have them stop from buying a gun because they had a name
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:02.360]  similar to someone the government really wanted to stop there's going to be a small but significant
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:08.360]  number of law abiding individuals who are stopped sure who may have really needed a gun quickly for
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:13.320]  self-defense well my dad's been on the watch list my dad's been on the watch list and had some gun
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:18.520]  issues he has no criminal record because his name is david jones and his middle name is common as well
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.880]  so there's probably there's thousands of david jones's there's hundreds with his exact name
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:30.040]  and so he has problems does that mean he was a terrorist they stopped no no exactly right i mean
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:34.840]  they basically look at two things they have a quote similar name they won't tell us exactly what they
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:41.480]  mean by a similar name and and birthday but when you have a name that's going to be extremely
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:47.800]  extremely common like david jones uh you know it's very likely that you'll have somebody some place
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:54.520]  else in the country that has a closest enough name and a birthday that will cause you to be flagged
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:45:01.320]  when you try to go and buy a gun for example and the way that the administration has made this even
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:08.040]  worse it's just been a problem since they started the background check system is that they go through
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:12.920]  and they determine whether it was a false positive but it's kind of like the last thing they do when
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:16.360]  they've spent money and everything else and they have a little bit of money left over then they go
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:21.640]  back through to see whether they've made mistakes in terms of classifying people but what the Obama
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:27.240]  administration's done is that they're essentially forcing you to hire a lawyer to go and find out
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:33.800]  what the result was before you would have been informed under previous administration but you
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:40.440]  know if you make somebody have to hire a lawyer pay a couple thousand dollars to go and find out
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:46.120]  whether or not uh you know it was an error but it's total harassment that it was an error
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.440]  right total harassment and again it's something that prevents poor individuals
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:56.840]  disproportional minority from being able to go and get a gun for protection
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:03.240]  and then they get a gun quote illegally they want to make it illegal and I guess in all
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:08.120]  jurisdictions to have a private transfer which is of course the facto registration we know the
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.000]  paradigm they engage in but I agree with you politically we should really be hammering not
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.880]  just the fact that these elites are armed but when us disarmed but also that all over the
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:24.680]  country they're passing laws and not exempting poor people from these gun taxes and that really is
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:31.480]  truly despicable because I don't know one rich liberal who doesn't get caught with armed bodyguards
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:37.080]  in fact I've been at their houses in in Los Angeles uh you'll go to like some of the most
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:41.320]  famous liberal people's houses and I've been to some of them I've been to parties and man they
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:47.240]  got armed former special forces people I guess the sexy thing to have is former Israeli commandos
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:55.320]  and uh and they'll just have armed commandos and I'm not talking about Charlie Sheen you know he's
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:00.920]  he's pro-second amendment does have armed Israeli commandos but I'll talk about other people uh
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:06.440]  and you're just there and it's like you're against guns but you got a guy in a suit and sports jacket
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:16.200]  with you know guns under his jacket standing guard in you know outside in a car or in your house uh
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:19.160]  I mean I'll be sitting there on the cell phone around the side of somebody's house making a phone
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.000]  call and you look over five feet and there's an Israeli commando looking at you with a
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:29.720]  submachine gun under their jacket and it's just it's so crazy I don't get the disconnect of these
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:36.440]  people why what is their problem or is it they're just so entitled they think it's it's it's okay for
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:43.640]  them to have guns but you can't they trust themselves to make the right decisions but they
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:48.600]  don't think anybody else is smart enough to be able to make the same decisions that they feel
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:55.080]  they're able to make themselves let's take some phone calls we got John and Wyoming, Ben, Doug,
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:48:01.720]  Eli, Alex and many many others I like this question from Ben Ben wants to ask well I'll
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:09.000]  let Ben ask it from Missouri go ahead Ben. Hey Alex how are you doing good brother go ahead again
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:16.120]  um so basically my uh my comment was is that I mean I I think the Second Amendment and uh gun
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:21.000]  registration you know trying to ban guns is the line in the sand for the American people that
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.920]  will kick off the revolution if there was going to be one uh it's just a question of like Salon
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:33.000]  said uh whether or not you know people like Hillary people like Obama you know we're gonna do that
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.360]  well let me ask it this way why do you because your phone cut earlier you need to get to this
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:40.760]  answer uh professor why do you think Hillary's talking about Australian style confiscation
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:45.800]  when it is so unpopular and they used to lie about their plan why would she politically do that I
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:50.920]  mean is she who's advising her and then obviously we're starting to win the Second Amendment fight
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:54.040]  I don't think we want to have a revolution that's what they want I think they want to maybe
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:59.160]  push us into people uh getting violent I don't think that's the answer but I do get it is a
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:05.240]  line in the sand uh professor Locke can you speak to that right well I don't think they're
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:09.880]  going to come right out and ban guns right away I mean you kind of touched on this earlier I think
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:17.400]  it's this process of trying to gradually change or maybe relatively quickly but over a period of time
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:24.120]  people's views on guns and one of the ways they try to do it is by putting taxes and fees on people
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.320]  being able to go and get guns to reduce sure professor what I'm asking you and I understand
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:34.040]  you only follow scientific stuff so I I get it you only answer questions you can answer I'm asking
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:39.240]  you why would Hillary and others come out and say maybe we should look at confiscation I mean
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:44.920]  she said that that is so unpopular right that's the second right that's the second part of your
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:53.320]  question look the obviously uh just a couple weeks ago she was talking about both Australia and UK
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:50:01.160]  it's having the type of gun laws that we should follow I wrote up a piece at crimeresearch.org
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:06.680]  that goes through the numbers on that she seems to think that improved crime rates in fact the
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:14.760]  opposite is true you looked at the UK when they banned handguns in January 1997 over the next eight
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:21.640]  years the homicide rate in the country increased by 50 percent they're so lower than ours but it went
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:25.560]  up relative to where it was there are other differences that exist across the country
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:33.080]  it's cultural in Australia and in Australia you've seen similar types of changes first of all
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:39.720]  they didn't ban guns in Australia what they did was they had a buyback of about a third of the gun
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:46.040]  and then people were able to go in and buy guns again and so you have this sudden sharp drop
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:52.600]  but then an increase in the rate of gun ownership over time and now by 2010 they were about back to
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.200]  where they were before the buyback amazing stay there professor we gotta go to break
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:59.880]  we're gonna come back with more calls straight ahead john lost our guest my dad was 59 when he

[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:31.560]  here is the clip of hillary talking to her constituents about how wonderful australia
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:37.720]  and england are and of course their crime rates went up i mean that's a fact after they restricted
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:43.880]  their right to keep their arms here it is you know australia is a good example canada is a
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:51.880]  good example the uk is a good example why because each of them had mass killings australia had a
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:55:02.200]  huge mass killing about 25 20 25 years ago canada did as well so did the uk and in reaction they
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:12.280]  passed much stricter gun laws in the australian example as i recall that was a buyback program
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:19.080]  the australian government as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:25.880]  offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and then they basically clamped down
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:31.320]  going forward in terms of having you know more of a background check approach more of a permitting
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:38.040]  approach um but they believed and i think she says we should look at that we've only got it
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:41.000]  for about three four minutes in this segment then another five minutes segment we've got
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.160]  peter schiff joining us on the economy and more and a bunch of news i haven't had but right now
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:50.680]  but right now let's go to calls uh let's go ahead and talk to john in wyoming you're on
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:57.080]  the air professor john lott go ahead hi alex uh three quick points when i was working at a large
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:05.560]  prestige prestigious gun shop in houston when the brady bill was passed about 90 of all denials
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:12.680]  were for unpaid traffic tickets wow nothing to do with felonies or crimes wow secondly ask the
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:20.840]  anti gunners to name one murderer rapist arm robber drug dealer gangbanger or terrorist who obeys
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:27.480]  gun laws third ask hillary clinton since you dislike guns why do you have so many secret
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:34.600]  service agents carrying micro uzi fully automatic nine millimeter submachine guns to protect you
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:40.600]  and your entourage well obviously this is common sense and it's an enemy under this administration
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.600]  the truth is they just want to conquer us and disarm us i mean that's what it comes down to
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:51.240]  a professor lot as as political pressure turns against them they are doubling down what do you
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:58.040]  expect them to do next i mean obviously just come out with fake statistics or what well i mean they've
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:02.760]  come out with a lot of reports and i think we're going to see a tidal wave of that type of information
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:08.120]  over the next year there's been you know just compare this year to a couple years ago they're
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:15.000]  spending literally hundreds of millions of dollars funding this type of research and so you know if
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:20.040]  anything it's amazing that they don't have even more stuff coming out but this next year coming up
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:26.360]  to the election uh you know coinciding with it on purpose is going to be a lot of research they're
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:33.160]  going to look if you look over the last 20 years or so support for more gun control kind of peaked
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:39.960]  in the late 1990s it's been falling since then and a lot of the surveys from gallup and others
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:46.200]  show that maybe slightly more people oppose more gun control now than support it but the real thing
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:53.240]  that explains how that those lines have moved over time are people's perceptions about whether guns
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.480]  make them safe or not if you go back to 2000 gallup did a survey that found that about only
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:06.360]  35 percent of people thought owning a gun in the home made them safer by december this last year
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:13.400]  that had gone up to 63 percent and bloomberg and others look at these polls they see them as well as
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:21.560]  i do and others do and and their plan then is to drive that number down to try to make people think
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:27.640]  that owning a gun in the home or carrying a concealed makes things more dangerous and if they
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:32.600]  can convince people that i think they believe that they'll have an easier shot so what they
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:37.400]  they do is they have a full court press hold on stay there back in 70 seconds professor what you've
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:44.840]  got to go to break hard break crimeresearch.org stay with us this is gcn the genesis communications radio

[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:29.080]  professor john lot got cut off by that hard break at the end of the hour he was getting into the
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:33.720]  tactics that they use finishing a point crime research dot org just because we're winning
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:38.440]  some battles does not mean we're winning the war these people have taken folks's guns all over the
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:43.320]  world they were trying to restrict knives in england people's steak knives and and and butcher
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:48.360]  knives i'm not joking that's bbc with a straight face reporting that again just this week we need
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:53.960]  to get on the offense and and really finish these people once and for all uh so we got a long way
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:01:00.200]  to go uh i'm sorry sir you got caught up by the break go ahead sure well what bloomberg's doing is
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:05.800]  he's funding the research he's funding academic institutions like columbia's journalism school
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:12.840]  to go and train reporters on how to in his mind properly cover the gun issue and then they're doing
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:18.680]  spending lots of money on the political activity why testified earlier this year in wyoming uh they
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:25.800]  were trying to get rid of uh some of the gunfree zones in the state and uh bloomberg had paid for
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:31.480]  buses to bring college democrats down from the university wyoming to the hearing they paid people
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:36.600]  to go and pass out pliers i guess getting twenty dollars an hour for doing that and they were able
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:42.520]  to pack the hearing room that was there by paying these people to come and cover their costs and
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:50.360]  things like that oh that i exposed that a decade ago here in austin right and the thing is um it
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:56.360]  it cowed probably at least one of the members of the panel that were voting and caused the defeat
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:02.280]  of uh the bill to try to get rid of the gunfree zones in nevada they did a similar type of thing
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:06.920]  and so that's one thing people need to look at what's happened in other countries switzerland
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:14.440]  for example george soros for decades has been funding a lot of anti gun research that's there
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:20.120]  and they really have nobody that's been on the other side to try to counter that and no academics
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:25.320]  in switzerland are kind of been on their side and they have lost that battle and so
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:30.920]  so the reason why we put together the crime prevention research center is people can look
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:37.160]  at our about page to see the prestigious academics that we have on our panel that's what drudge said
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:41.720]  when he was here he said so much important stuff is why i go back to it he said you notice there's
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:48.200]  only a few people in every position academics statisticians talk show hosts journalists
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:53.960]  that are really fighting and we're winning but there's not a second row of teeth here you know
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:58.840]  there's not like another set's coming in that's why we need to get more people that are prominent
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:03.080]  and have letters to their name to get in the fight and not just say thank god john lots there
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:07.800]  let's go to mary in georgia mary you're on the year welcome only call we have time to go to i'll
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:14.040]  get to the others uh after our guest leaves us go ahead mary yes yes hi alex um yeah i have a
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:19.800]  practical uh question and concern sure um i'm actually i'm traveling around the country i've
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:24.760]  done a band all all decked out and traveling around the country and having a great time uh i
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:29.880]  want traveling traveling alone and i feel like i need a gun i have a practical reason to have
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:38.360]  oh you do yeah but but i'm more afraid to be shot by a cop for having a gun than i am of being robbed
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:43.080]  or assaulted well i mean just don't pick the gun up or have it out in view and i mean i don't want
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:50.520]  to give you advice there's so many different laws and states but generally a shotgun a rifle you
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:55.320]  know check the laws of each state you go into and have it where you can get to it but but like under
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:59.000]  a blanket or something and if a cop pulls you over tell them by the way i have a firearm for
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.920]  myself protection uh professor lot yeah well i think the police are the last ones you should
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:10.920]  be concerned about look the police are actually relieved to find that you're a permit holder
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:17.640]  because the police know how incredibly law-abiding concealed handgun permit holders are and so when
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:23.240]  they pull you over and you say i have a concealed handgun permit and i have my gun with me as you're
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:30.440]  supposed to tell them when they do that trust me leave to nothing there because you're more
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:38.840]  alone but you know absolutely okay professor lot amazing interview crime research dot org use this

[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:48.040]  uropac.com billions under management of course it is peter schiff his father passed a few weeks
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:53.160]  ago over the other side and of course was a frequent guest on this show and a friend of mine
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:58.680]  before he was thrown in prison more than 11 12 years ago and he died basically as a political
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:05.160]  prisoner for a long time basically denied medical care then still chained down basically to the
[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:11.400]  moment he passed uh and this is very very sad i can imagine how sad it is for peter schiff so we'll
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:18.920]  speak about some of that up front because it's bigger than just irwin schiff we're not just
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:23.000]  remembering a patriot that wrote best-selling books exposing the irs and the federal reserve
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:29.240]  basically sounded like ron paul and they put him in prison for it and when ron paul was on with us
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:34.040]  two weeks ago he was on with us yesterday as well uh without me prompting he brought up irwin schiff
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:39.080]  and said it's a real sign of how much danger this country's in then they had a bunch of publications
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:44.280]  like media matters right wing watch you name it make fun of ron paul we have record numbers of
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:51.560]  whistleblowers in prison we have record numbers of journalists in prison now a section of the tpp
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:57.240]  trans specific partnership came out it's even worse than we thought arrest whistleblowers
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:05.640]  journalists worldwide i mean this is getting bad and but it's okay because the so-called left
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.840]  can make jokes about it all day and don't think when the right wing gets back in the you know the
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:16.520]  rhino types they won't be just as bad i've never seen liberals act like this they just act so
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:21.720]  totalitarian it's funny to them again they made fun of ron paul and a bunch of publications
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:28.760]  and with a straight face can you believe he says america is in a tyranny and is getting worse because
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:35.880]  you know we put irwin schiff in prison i mean people say if a nazi germany came here if soviet
[02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:40.360]  russia came here or alexander schultz and eason got locked up we'd do something about it it can't
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:46.920]  happen here well you know what it is happening here they put him in prison for writing books
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:50.520]  calling the federal government a mafia and the judge said the last vegas review journal never
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:56.120]  forget you're being put in prison because you were told last time not not to write these books or
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:01.320]  sell these books i mean imagine being a judge saying you can't put this book out in america
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:05.240]  whether it was true or not that's like kevin turdoe i don't agree with some of the stuff in
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:09.720]  his books i read several of them some of it was true some of it wasn't but if they can lock him up
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:16.440]  for writing natural cures they don't want you to know about they can lock anybody up but the case
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:22.040]  was schiff he what he said was accurate and then they said we'll let you out of prison
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:26.520]  or we'll keep you from going to prison you just gotta recant all this well he wouldn't do it
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:31.800]  and that's the stuff that legends are made of so uh your dad's gone but not forgotten and here
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:37.560]  alive with us i know it's hard to talk about but uh you eulogize your father uh beautifully comparing
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:44.200]  you know to like the in-scene and braveheart it's true uh in what you wrote there at url pack.com we
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:49.560]  also posted it a lot of other big sites posted it but what would you like to say about your dad
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:55.960]  i mean you heard my rant about it it really makes me sick and it makes me angry yeah and you know
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:01.400]  there was a lot of coverage uh the new york times did an obituary actually the economist has the
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:07.080]  back page of the magazine uh an obituary to my father but you know one of the parts that bothered
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:12.760]  me about uh the economists and you know the the the writer didn't even bother to call me or my
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:17.160]  brother asked anything just you know they just write the article but if you look at the uh the
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:22.920]  final paragraph uh the inference is that hey you know my dad got revenged because he got to live out
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:29.080]  his final years you know on the taxpayer like he got a nice place to live and he got a free room
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:35.320]  and board and medical care and i i've even seen some other articles written from that perspective
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:40.760]  that hey you know he wasn't paying taxes but all of us people who were were supporting him in you
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:45.160]  know the equivalent of an old age home except better because you know it was supposedly a you
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:51.320]  know a country club type facility but these people never actually visited my father you had no idea
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:56.440]  the the conditions under which he was living it's it is not club fed they maybe they used to have
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:00.840]  institutions like that a long time ago but they don't have them anymore and that's not where my
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:07.640]  father was and the really bad part about it is remember he was moved from a relatively you know
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:13.160]  low security facility convenient to me and my brother and other relatives who could regularly
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:21.560]  visit him and he was sent first to uh a a a facility in indiana in terra hote and then to this one
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:29.400]  in in in in texas in foreworth because these were hospital type facilities my dad turned 80
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:35.320]  and when he got to be 80 they said okay you need to be in these facilities that have this top-notch
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:40.200]  medical care because you know you're he's 80 years old that we really need to take care of them and
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.080]  we can't do that unless we're in these certain facilities and so on that basis they moved him
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:49.560]  now we didn't even want to move him he didn't want to be moved nobody wanted to move him
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:53.480]  we tried to intervene that was one of the things that ron paul tried to help me with is to try to
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:59.000]  get him back closer to us but we could never do it so he was there supposedly to get good medical
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:05.800]  care they didn't even know he had cancer until two months before he died two months before
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:12.120]  and the cancer was so bad it had spread all over his body from initially being you know a skin
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:16.920]  cancer melanoma on his head but by the time they even knew he was sick he was two months away from
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:21.720]  death i mean what kind of medical facility is that i mean you could see a guy who's out in a
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:26.520]  real world who's stubborn he doesn't go to the doctor and then he finds out he's really sick
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:31.080]  and you know he should have gone my father is living theoretically in a hospital in a prison
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:35.080]  hospital yet they didn't know he was sick until he was on death not just classic i mean they you
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:39.800]  know chop your legs off and give you a pair of crutches but for me peter it's that he is a classic
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:45.320]  political prisoner he didn't do anything and that tells me none of us are safe it shows how
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:51.000]  sick the federal government is how out of their minds they are yeah he is in jail look he they
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:56.360]  accused him of violating various laws it's not he's just in jail for writing a book but of course
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:15:00.680]  writing that book is one of the reasons for the severity of the sense they raise it i remember
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:06.680]  the judge raised the book yeah well that was the judge didn't have to give a 77 year old man 14 years
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:12.440]  i mean there are people who have evaded lots of money in taxes you know that that they get much
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:19.720]  smaller sentences than than my father got so that was to send him a message for his political stance
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:25.240]  and his exercise of his constitutional rights and freedom of the press and free speech but
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:31.160]  but in order to have been convicted of any of those crimes the jury or was going to have to be
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:35.880]  convinced the governor was going to have to prove that my father was willful that my father
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:41.400]  actually believed what he was doing was wrong and there was no evidence introduced at all
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:47.160]  to suggest that my father wasn't being sincere well i know your dad was pretty good and at dinner
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:51.560]  he was very entertaining and very smart as you know you couldn't get him to stop talking about
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:57.000]  this and the proof he was obsessed with it he was a zealot he totally believed it he didn't
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.640]  stop talking about it until he couldn't talk the last time i spoke with him a few weeks before he
[02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:07.080]  died that's all he could say right he was talking about how he's in jail illegally and how he wants
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:11.960]  me to continue his legal battles on behalf of his estate for wrongful imprisonment my father
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:17.960]  is still trying to win he's still somehow thought that he could get justice ultimately in a completely
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:23.400]  unjust system i mean my father always recognized the corruption in the courts but for some reason
[02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:28.120]  he believed that eventually he could overcome that uh that you know he was so corrected what he
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:32.520]  was doing uh that the government would have no choice or the judicial system would have no choice
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:39.640]  and that ultimately he would prevail and he believed that up until he he died well like
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:45.160]  ron paul said here two weeks ago uh it shows how far this country's fallen what they did to your
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:50.520]  dad i mean if people don't have empathy and realize that could happen to any of us something's wrong
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:55.880]  with them it's at most it should have been civil if the government thought my father was doing
[02:16:55.880 --> 02:17:00.760]  something wrong it should have been a civil matter uh you cannot turn the exercise the good faith
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:05.400]  exercise of a constitutional right into a crime you can't put people in jail if they think the
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:09.800]  government is breaking the law because let's assume you think that my father was wrong what
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:14.120]  about the next guy what if the government really starts doing things that are wrong assuming that
[02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:17.960]  they haven't already what if they arrest you for saying the the the NSA shouldn't be spying on you
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.320]  yeah look you know it's the cabels nose under the tent you cannot let the government imprison
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:28.520]  people who challenge what they're doing on the basis that what they're doing is wrong or illegal
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:36.200]  or unconstitutional a lot's going on but i want to finish up the segment on your dad and and and
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:42.600]  other political prisoners um it it really is scary to see him doing this and openly saying
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:46.280]  they want to restrict free speech now again drudge was here a few weeks ago and he pointed
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:50.520]  out that he had dinner with the supreme court justice and they said no the word is they're
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:55.000]  coming after the first amendment they're going to shut down websites talk radio and people say
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:01.080]  oh that'll never happen well then they said obama care would never happen they have to try to shut
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:06.680]  us down because we are politically starting to wake people up yeah and remember again they banned
[02:18:06.680 --> 02:18:12.600]  a judge banned him from selling his last book the federal mafia and you know that is the only non-fiction
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:18.280]  book ever banned under any circumstances in the united states and you know there was only one
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:22.600]  other book that was banned that it was you know an erotic book uh and so this is the only non-fiction
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:27.720]  of course it's the last book that has been banned but you know what it might not be there may be
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:33.960]  books banned in the future now that this very bad precedent has been set and unchallenged nobody
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:38.040]  seemed to care that the government banned this book and if they can get away with banning my
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:43.800]  father's book what other books are they going to get away with banning in the future i just can't
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:49.000]  believe i'm sitting here talking to you and they killed your dad i mean i think it's fair to say
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:55.080]  that a political prisoner they banned his book and this isn't some dark satire science fiction
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:19:01.560]  movie this is really going on peter yeah and look this is the beginning this is how tyranny
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:07.080]  you know uh takes hold when people sit by and do nothing and they allow it to happen they'll say oh
[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:11.480]  he was just a tax protester that's how everybody forgives it well award ship well he was a tax
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:16.760]  protester as if being a tax protester means you lose all of your rights well george waston was a
[02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:21.160]  tax protester yeah but if the government can strip you of your rights because you're a tax
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:26.200]  protester well they can strip you of your rights for any reason they have you know so everybody
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:31.160]  is at risk when one person is at risk and you can't just be complacent and excuse it there is no
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:36.360]  excuse for what they did to my father absolutely oh but wall street doesn't get in trouble for the
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:41.400]  derivatives nobody goes to jail they still trillions of dollars but erwin schiff dies well you know
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.800]  what he won in the end though getting the word out and he's a hero so you got to feel i mean how

[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:17.640]  need to talk about the news the imploding borders here in in europe the millions of refugees running
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:23.000]  around raping people and demanding more freebies it's over the top i can't even believe it's this
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:32.040]  crazy ices blowing up the russian plane they claim and then our media is acting like they want to
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:35.960]  team up with russia to stop them when our own government's been funding them but the economy
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:42.120]  that's really where pierce shift it is the expert we should smart go on other stuff as well so we'll
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:48.120]  pick his brain but in this short segment anything else i guess we could say about your dad we can
[02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:54.600]  talk for hours about him and then shifting gears in the economy i think when we do abolish the irs
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:25:00.760]  you could call the bill to do it uh the congressman um hansen bill but they didn't kill him they tried in
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:05.960]  jail uh while he was waiting for trial desolating him but your dad i guess they were somewhat
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:11.480]  successful obviously but i think in the end he will go down as one of the main martyrs uh getting
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:15.640]  us out from under this irs tyranny i mean not just the fraud of the irs but what about their
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:20.360]  persecution not just of your dad but now mainline conservatives and other people
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:28.760]  yeah i mean how far do you think it's going to go yeah look lowest learner yeah and nothing
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:32.120]  happened to lowest learner right they decided we're not going to press charge against her for any of
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:36.360]  the wrong doings that she did but make sure we keep her in shift in jail you know and i said
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:40.840]  just before the break when they decided to make a martyr out of him you know had the government
[02:25:40.840 --> 02:25:47.560]  shown at least some compassion for my father later in life and and maybe allowed him to to get out of
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:53.640]  jail or had they not given him such a harsh punishment or when you know years ago three
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:57.800]  four years ago we were trying to get him out because of health problems that he had we didn't
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:02.520]  know he had cancer at the time but he had other problems you know with his vision you know losing
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:07.800]  his teeth uh having a hard time just walking and you know started you know develop some dementia
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:12.120]  i mean there are all these different things that happen to you as you get old and i'm saying look
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:16.680]  you know i want to get him out of that prison so that you know he can he could get better medical
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.760]  care because i didn't really trust the medical care he was getting there and of course i wanted him
[02:26:20.760 --> 02:26:26.360]  to uh have a family around him friends around him i thought that from a psychological factor
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:31.880]  that would be important in in the will to live and he's still be alive healthy yeah and had they
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:36.120]  let him out a few years ago he would still be alive because he would have got the medical care
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:40.360]  that needed that cancer would have been caught early enough uh you know my father didn't get
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:44.360]  lung cancer because he smoked he never smoked i mean he was in pretty good health when he went
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:51.480]  into jail at age 77 and uh and and so you know he might have been you know lived into his 90s
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:55.960]  who knows maybe he would have been over a hundred you never know how long my father would have
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:00.920]  lived you know some of the articles that i wrote acted as if the fact that he lived to 87 was the
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:06.440]  result of all the good no i knew him well he was he was he was robust for his age pretty manly
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:13.880]  yeah and and so you know he the government robbed him of the dignity of his of his uh senior years
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:18.920]  and you can say well he deserves what he got you know he he fought the irs he didn't fight it out of
[02:27:18.920 --> 02:27:23.480]  greed my father wasn't trying to make money and he didn't make money i mean he what he made he
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:27.720]  spent but he lived in a small one bedroom two bedroom apartment he drove an old car he never
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:32.920]  took vacations and he worked weekends and evenings on his cause because he believed in it so he
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:38.120]  wasn't like a guy who lies on his tax return conceals his income sure they took him down
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:43.880]  because he was effective and then they were vindictive little creeps persecuting him till he
[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:48.040]  died i mean you described how he was chained down a few weeks before he died when you came and saw him
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:52.440]  yeah and they don't even remove it i mean they try to tell me well we're making him comfortable
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:57.000]  look look the chain's not too tight it's like you know what why is it there you know because you can't
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.720]  move around as much in the bed when your leg is shackled to a to the side of the bed even if you
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:06.360]  try to make it comfortable i mean why even put it on see they're just they just follow orders they
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:10.520]  say well these are the rules this is what we have to do yeah that's what the nazis said i'm just
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:15.320]  going to follow orders he can't even get out of the bed i mean it's ridiculous to chain somebody
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:21.800]  who can't move who's blind and and and he's living off tubes you know he's not going anywhere
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:25.800]  can't they see that but no they just have to do what the government says because they're they're
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:30.040]  good nazis you know not that they're as bad as nazis i might want to say that you know
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:33.480]  but it's going into the same universe i don't know plant parent at all of it they are
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:39.080]  we're going to go to break in a minute long segment coming up shifting gears out of the
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:44.200]  i think heroic you know story of your father that is just becoming more epic and so you know god
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:49.160]  rest his soul and and obviously you're sad you got to be proud so we just thank you for your father
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:53.240]  and you know his work but shifting years out of that when we go to break when we come back
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:57.400]  a economic front what are you going to be covering well we're going to be going to talk
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:01.800]  about the jobs numbers and the spin the media is putting on it i'm going to give you the truth
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:06.440]  what's actually going on now we've got to talk about the fed everybody thinks that these job
[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:11.560]  numbers cemented a a rate hike in december and i still don't think the fed is going to raise
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:15.240]  interest rates in december i don't think it matters what these jobs numbers were i don't
[02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:19.240]  think the fed's raising rates they might surprise me and do it anyway but i don't think they will
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:24.200]  well you've been right so far your predictions have come true on that front uh all this and
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:29.720]  more europe pack dot com peter schiff joining us via video skype and we've got frank and patriot

[02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:54.600]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:03.800]  ran paul look where isis gets its weapons from they have anti-tank weapons and missiles
[02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:08.920]  that we gave them article up by steve watson presidential candidate ron paul has urged voters
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:13.800]  to look to where isis is getting its weapons from to understand the monumental problem the
[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:19.880]  us is facilitating in syria and beyond speaking with ed brliner of newsmax paul stated most of
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:24.680]  these people do not have the sophistication to make arms so they get the arms from other folks
[02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:29.160]  right now the isis has over a billion dollars worth of u.s humvees and they have a billion dollars in
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:33.880]  cash they stole from us so really if we don't want weapons to get into the hands of folks
[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:38.360]  we should be very careful about who we give the weapons to the senator stated paul then
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:44.280]  elaborated by noting that during the libyan civil war 15 000 shoulder to air missiles
[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:50.360]  made by the united states went missing that's why there is a concern that airliners might be taken
[02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:56.360]  down by shoulder to air missiles paul noted here at info wars dot com we smash you the lies and

[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:45.320]  see how much longer it can continue on well it's not really continuing on we have all the numbers
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:51.560]  coming out even the cook numbers show the things are sliding but there is wealth it's just not being
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:56.200]  equally distributed and of course wealth isn't supposed to be artificially distributed but it is
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:34:03.320]  by central banks now like our federal reserve that came into being the same week that the irs
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:08.360]  came into being and the same week they got rid of senators being elected by the legislatures
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:14.440]  that's right that's when they took over that's when the central banks expanded their control
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:21.480]  and peter schiff of europe pack dot com is our guest so you predicted in the last couple years they
[02:34:21.480 --> 02:34:25.400]  wouldn't raise interest rates you continue to say they wouldn't do it then the chinese have
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:32.120]  started dumping treasuries so since we had you on a month or so ago what has changed what is your
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:41.640]  current prognosis peter schiff well you know nothing has actually changed but the perception
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:47.240]  now is that the fed is about to raise rates in december of course the markets had that perception
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:51.480]  all year long they thought they would raise in march then june and september and now they're
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:56.040]  convinced that the lift off is going to happen in december the reason they're convinced of that
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:03.240]  is because janet yellen spoke both after they failed to raise interest rates in october through
[02:35:03.240 --> 02:35:08.440]  their their statement and more recently this week she was testified before congress and basically
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:16.040]  what she said was that if the economy continues to improve the way they believe it will and if the
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:24.600]  labor market improves further and if inflation the way the government measures it gets to their
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:30.360]  two percent level and they're satisfied that it's going to be at two percent in the medium term
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:36.200]  whatever that is that if all these things happen then it's possible that the fed might raise rates
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:41.320]  that's all she said and the interpretation was oh the fed's going to raise rates for sure and then
[02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:46.520]  when we got the jobs numbers that came out today which were on the surface much stronger than what
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:51.320]  everybody had been looking for that sealed the deal as far as everybody was concerned the fed's
[02:35:51.320 --> 02:35:56.840]  going to raise rates and i don't think it seals anything i still think the fed is not going to
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:02.280]  raise rates in december you know it's a it's a possibility just like yellen said anything is
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:07.400]  possible and maybe the fed will surprise me and raise rates i think from their perspective it would
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:12.280]  be a very dangerous mistake if they did that because i think it would just accelerate the
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:17.960]  collapse in the markets and that would put them in a very difficult position as you know has been
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:24.360]  weighing in saying don't do that well i mean they needed to do it a long time ago but a lot
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:29.160]  of people don't want this party to end and so they want the fed to continue to serve the alcohol
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:32.680]  but i don't think obama wants it to end either you know even donald trump has been
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:37.800]  saying that he thinks that it's the president that told janet yellen not to raise rates well
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:43.000]  i don't think yellen needs to hear that from obama i think she can figure that out on her own
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  that she can't raise rates meanwhile let's look at this jobs number everybody all that when you go
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:52.440]  home tonight you listen to the evening news all they're going to talk about is this 271,000 jobs
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:58.440]  so this is the grade this is the best month of the year well the only reason we got 271,000 jobs
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:03.480]  is because the last two months were awful we just had the two worst i was about to say they say the
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:08.600]  best job numbers of the year they've all been total crap everybody's hiring seasonal people for
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:14.760]  christmas yeah and you know so the last two months were very weak and everybody was expecting big
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:19.400]  revisions upward people were saying oh those those numbers can't possibly be real and you know what
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:24.040]  they barely revised them so if you actually look at the fact that we didn't get the revisions that
[02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:29.160]  everybody thought so we just got more jobs in october to make up for the fewer jobs that everybody
[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:35.080]  thought we could get in august and september over the last three months we averaged 187,000 jobs
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:40.120]  per month that is slower than the pace for the first part of the year which was the average was
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:46.760]  over 200,000 last year's three month average was better than 250,000 so the jobs are slowing down
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:52.280]  but don't you always get a bump this time of year because of the seasonal hiring yes we do and then
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:56.520]  i guess there was a bigger bump than normal and i think businesses are making a mistake hiring
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:01.560]  people again they think the economy is stronger than it is but the labor force participation
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:11.240]  stayed at 62.4 which is match that ties the low but again all the jobs about 200,000 of these jobs
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:16.760]  were in health care and education they're in retail you know cash registers cash years right
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:23.640]  leisure and hospitality bartenders waiters temporary jobs we we didn't gain any manufacturing jobs
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:30.600]  we lost mining and uh and logging jobs we lost jobs and transportation so we added the low paying
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:36.600]  service sector jobs and here's a statistic which no one is really talking about with the demographics
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:46.520]  all of the job gains went to people over the age of 55 right between 24 and 55 35,000 jobs were lost
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:57.480]  and what gets worse is if you just look at men age 24 to 55 119,000 jobs lost by young men so who
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:03.240]  gained jobs in this economy it's older workers who would rather be retired who have to come out of
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:08.440]  retirement and get a job you know as a greeter at walmart or bagging groceries and i think married
[02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:14.360]  women whose husbands can no longer afford to support them having to go back into the labor force
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:19.480]  that's really what's going on but you know beneath the surface the the younger men american men who
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:25.880]  need jobs and want jobs good jobs not part-time jobs or temporary jobs that need real jobs they
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:32.120]  can't get them and they're moving back in with their parents other areas of the economy you've
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:39.240]  talked about cities going under states killing under the california retirement fund the chinese
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:44.920]  economy obviously you know you say you think maybe better than ours some other experts say they think
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:50.120]  it's going to be worse look at the euro crisis what could be the next big trigger when you're
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:59.240]  looking at triggers that could cause a new dot com type event like 2000 or could cause some type of
[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:07.000]  event like we saw in 2007 2008 or do you just see a gradual rotting of the economy i mean i know
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.960]  you don't have a crystal ball but looking out there what are the triggers well again i think
[02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:19.320]  that the the way this is going to you know deflate this bubble is that the fed is not going to be able
[02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:24.760]  to raise interest rates and people are eventually going to figure out that predicament because of
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:30.200]  the fed's failure to act and the dollar is ultimately going to turn around take the bond market with
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:35.720]  it push up consumer inflation push up interest rates and really put the squeeze on the economy
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:42.600]  even further if the fed actually tries to raise interest rates well then they're just going to
[02:40:42.600 --> 02:40:47.880]  prick the bubble that much faster so either way the air is going to come out and we're headed for
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:52.760]  a crisis but again what i think is going to be different about this crisis is this is going to
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:57.800]  be the final crisis the final nail in the coffin is going to be a dollar crisis and a sovereign
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:03.560]  debt crisis where there are no bailouts because the US government is the entity that's going broke
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:10.760]  the crisis is going to be in dollars in treasuries so the government can't bail out itself they were
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:15.560]  able to bail out the banks they were able to bail out private companies by going deeper into debt
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:21.000]  and printing more money but when people finally question the value of that debt and that money
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:28.520]  the bailouts end a lot of folks like dent think it's going to start imploding any time now
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:34.520]  but in a way it's kind of already imploded the question is how how deep will that go
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:40.280]  i mean you know in meantime you know they run up the dollar right everybody's so convinced
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:44.520]  oh the fed's going to raise rates the dollar's way up gold's down again you know we're back down
[02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:50.360]  below 1100 when the fed didn't raise rates in october that morning gold was almost a 1200
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:56.280]  we're as high as 1190 now we're back below 1100 uh gold stocks are back down near the lows the
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:01.960]  dollar is spiking up everybody is fooled again the same old game just where we were full few months
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:07.240]  ago but the opportunity how long can they play that game look i don't know how many times the fed
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:11.400]  is going to be able to acquire wolf and the townsmen keep running is if there's actually a wolf there
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:15.880]  meanwhile the fed doesn't actually say this the fed just says it's possible we might raise interest
[02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:21.080]  rates and everybody assumes that that means it's inevitable but the fed doesn't do anything to damp
[02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:26.120]  in those expectations because the fed likes this because the market is doing its work for it but
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:31.240]  what your listeners should do is say hey this is another opportunity you know i now i can sell my
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:36.760]  dollar maybe i you know i can establish an account with petership i can get more assets in switzerland
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:41.640]  or singapore new zealand or norway or hunk wherever i'm investing and i can get a better deal i can
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:46.680]  buy some gold stocks now because these currency speculators really believe the fed and they just
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:50.760]  sold off the price of gold they brought down the value of gold stocks that's an opportunity that's
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:55.560]  a buying opportunity for the few people out there that actually actually recognize what is really
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:00.920]  going on because when wall street wakes up to the fed's con these markets i think are going to reverse
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:05.480]  sure in a very spectacular and rapid fashion and by then it's too late you got to get yourself
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:09.800]  positioned before everybody wakes up i want to go to some phone calls here because i've got some
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:14.520]  good questions frank in new york you're on the air with petership go ahead frank
[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:21.320]  yes um my condolences to you mr ship um your father was a true patriot an example thank you for us
[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:29.240]  absolutely all right i'm i'm no economist but this is my opinion as far as it's the money economy i
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:33.960]  mean we did these five things i think we'll probably be out of debt in maybe two or three years if we
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:39.880]  put the the dollar back at the gold standard you know reinstalled glass beagle repealed the 16th
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:47.160]  amendment repealed the irs and repealed the federal reserve now now being said um i've spoken to other
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:53.320]  people um you know in my community and basically they're telling me that if the if the fed was ever
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:59.160]  to be abolished that there'll be a catastrophic event it cannot go wise i disagree totally
[02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:03.160]  but just for those listeners that are probably listening right now can you explain that as far
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:09.480]  as that would that help well tremendous how do we transfer out of this system if myself you ron paul
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:14.840]  others as a liberty movement getting back to the way our country grew at 10 plus percent from its
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:19.160]  inception till you until the federal reserve came in now we think three percent's great how do we go
[02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:24.280]  back to that real prosperity yeah well first of all we can end the fed because we didn't always have
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:29.960]  the fed you know the fed again as you mentioned didn't come into existence until 1913 so we obviously
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:35.640]  made it through the industrial revolution without a federal reserve and i think we would have prospered
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:40.600]  you know much greater had the federal reserve never been created be on mars the important thing
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:45.720]  though is we don't want to eliminate the fed and just transfer their powers to congress or the
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:51.560]  white house or something we have to return to the sound monetary system that we had prior to the
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:57.000]  development of the federal reserve uh that would be a solution and yes if we got rid of the income
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:03.640]  tax then yes we'd have a much more vibrant economy but it wouldn't immediately take care of the debt
[02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:08.680]  because the problem is we already have all this debt and there's no way to repay it and if we go
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:14.840]  back to a honest monetary system interest rates are going to have to go up and there's no way to
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:20.120]  even service the current debt in that environment let alone repay it so we we're going to have to
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:25.320]  restructure that debt right to have an honest recovery and deal with the debt we have to restructure
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:31.320]  it and what that means is that people don't get repaid in full the people who bought treasuries
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:35.560]  don't get a hundred cents on the dollar the people who were promised social security benefits or
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:40.600]  government pensions they don't get what they were promised that's what has to happen as a down payment
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:45.240]  on a real recovery but if we want to pretend that we can keep these commitments then we're
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:50.120]  going to have massive inflation because that's the only way the government can pay and of course we
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:55.000]  can't have massive inflation if we go back to a gold standard so if we don't want to default on
[02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:58.920]  our debts we're not going back to a gold standard so instead we're going to hyper inflate our debts
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:05.800]  away and maybe in the aftermath of that currency crisis then maybe we'll have the impetus to finally
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:10.680]  restore a gold standard or go back on that but we're not going to be able to preempt this crisis
[02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:15.240]  there is no political will for that it's only going to be the aftermath well that's my next point
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:19.720]  pure chaos exactly ron paul's been making that point forever that we've got to get in place before
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:24.600]  the collapse so we have the real alternative because they're going to push total socialism
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:29.560]  with crony capitalist offshore above the law exempt from it a true nightmare we could get real
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:34.040]  tyranny that we see them setting up uh during the collapse i want to go to noel wild jeremy
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:37.720]  mike patriot and others but what about this quick question peter i want your take on this
[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:43.320]  obviously governments everywhere digging in for civil unrest while funding bizarre leftist
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:51.160]  organizations uh you know calling for all sorts of uh bigger state but it isn't just the corrupt
[02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:57.720]  elite we have there are a lot of lazy entitled people out there but it's not even so much the
[02:46:57.720 --> 02:47:03.880]  welfare heads it's the permanent students it's the people that buy into the system they are so
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:09.480]  entitled and they are so delusional and then there's all the working poor that are just amazing
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:16.200]  people but they're getting screwed over what's going to happen when say 50 60 70 million entitled
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:22.680]  snot-nosed liberals uh when this all goes belly up what are they going to do when their free ride
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:29.080]  is over i don't know i i you know and i think we're going to find out unfortunately and you know
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:34.520]  i you can look at some of the scenes uh you know of some of the rioting and the looting that takes
[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:40.040]  place uh just on a small incident in fact i've even seen cities riot when their team wins the
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:45.160]  super bowl or the world series and they take it yeah i mean so can you imagine what would happen in
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:51.000]  america in a real economic crisis where there's no food in the stores where the shortages where
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.080]  there's blackouts you know rolling blackouts where you know the welfare checks or there's
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:59.480]  unemployment checks where they don't come or that you can't cash them or you can't buy anything uh
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:04.120]  you know you know we are not the civil society you look at those pictures of the great depression
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:07.800]  people waiting peacefully in these uh these soup lines i mean it's not going to look like that this
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:13.080]  time around i agree we're sitting on a sickening time bomb and they're hardworking people very
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:18.040]  race color and creed they're great americans we're still exceptional in many ways but it's it's a
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:25.560]  dichotomy we also have exceptionally dumb entitled angry people and i'm just sick of them i mean
[02:48:25.560 --> 02:48:29.640]  people like will stand in line and like tell you to hurry up when there's two people behind you for
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:35.000]  no reason they're they're just angry they're petulant they but then they don't get angry about
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.160]  their rights being trampled they don't get angry about the right stuff they get angry about petty
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:44.200]  stuff and i can't imagine during it during the depression you know people were embarrassed to
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:48.200]  go on relief and they felt very privileged i mean they didn't they knew it wasn't necessarily an
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:53.000]  american thing because we all believed in private charity not forced government redistribution
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:58.440]  but when people did get money from the government they really were grateful for what they got i mean
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:03.160]  there were even some people that paid it back they had a guilty conscience uh for getting
[02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:07.800]  something for nothing uh and so it's a different environment right now americans expect to get
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:12.520]  taken care of they think they're owed something from the government as a birthright so it's a
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:16.600]  much bigger difference when you lose something that you believe you're entitled to and when
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:21.240]  you're giving something and you're grateful for having been giving something key totally key
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:28.040]  it's very scary folks i'm very scary no well in virginia you're on the air go ahead hi good
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:34.440]  afternoon gentlemen uh great show today uh here i'm just want to send my condolence thank you dad
[02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:38.920]  pass but you know what the truth is the truth and it always will be revealed i got a couple of
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:43.720]  questions and i know there's a lot of people behind any autonomy i don't really believe anything that
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:50.920]  what the government says i believe that we are heading to a major collapse and i told you wine
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:55.320]  you know i've been studying about the money a way to follow the money and you know you got
[02:49:55.320 --> 02:50:00.280]  three central banks one is in the van again the other one is in the united uh and the uk and then
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:06.040]  you have another one at the district columbia where all this money is transferred there and they call
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:10.280]  them the crowns again and they above the law because they have their own law and they have
[02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:15.560]  their own police and they don't report sure what about these corporate city states that are above
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:20.600]  the law that that's a great question uh the un's kind of its own above the law organization setting
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:25.640]  up a taxing authority the tpp the big world government meeting coming up in december in
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:31.720]  paris they've exempted themselves uh now france will only have borders for this meeting i mean
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:39.640]  this is so insane uh is that what you're getting at noel yes and the other thing is um the chinese
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:45.480]  china uh you know since dumping their treasury bonds all of this you know it's a big major
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:53.080]  announcement coming up in december with the ims will accept china into the table and with their
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:59.720]  currency will place out currency then i believe that's when hydro inflation excuse me hydro
[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:04.840]  inflation and all of this is going to hit home no that's a lot that's a lot of stuff noel uh let
[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:12.200]  me get peter just take on that go ahead the imf is going to be allowing the arctic chinese yuan
[02:51:12.200 --> 02:51:17.320]  to be an acceptable currency as a reserve currency and that's one of the the steps in the direction
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:22.280]  of that currency uh achieving a higher degree of global except one of the chinese are starting
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:26.520]  to pull out of us treasuries well i i think they're also trying to pull out because you know they
[02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:30.520]  know that we can't pay and they're trying to cut their losses because they have so many but you
[02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:34.120]  know along the lines of what your caller is discussing i just wrote an article about the
[02:51:34.120 --> 02:51:39.800]  creeping communism uh in japan about where quantitative easing is going because normally
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:43.800]  if the government tries to nationalize a business right people are going to say oh no no that's
[02:51:43.800 --> 02:51:48.360]  communism you just can't the government can't take over businesses but the japanese central
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:53.960]  bank has been printing money and buying up stocks through etfs and now they want to print money and
[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:58.920]  buy shares in public corporations well since they can create money out of thin air and then they use
[02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:04.600]  it to buy up companies how is that different than nationalizing industries total fascism and you
[02:52:04.600 --> 02:52:08.280]  know we could be heading in the same direction if we're going to say hey the federal reserve
[02:52:08.280 --> 02:52:13.000]  can print money and buy up bonds well why can't they print money and buy up stocks why can't they
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.920]  print money and buy up everything what if the federal reserve prints enough money so that they own
[02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:21.560]  all of our assets i mean that's you know i've actually seen proposals where they're saying the fed
[02:52:21.560 --> 02:52:26.120]  should start you know openly buying stock which you know they do sometimes to prop it up and should
[02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:31.560]  start you know buying everything just sharing it all and then the japanese are saying hey this would
[02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:35.880]  be a good idea because the government takes over these companies it can pay people higher wages
[02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:39.640]  you know and so it's like you heard about yeah let's let's have a government planned economy
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:44.360]  let's nationalize industry and let's let the government set wages well we already seen how
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:48.280]  that ends we saw the soviet union you know you look at you look at cuba look at what happened
[02:52:48.280 --> 02:52:53.880]  in east germany we know it doesn't work but it's not going to work if we put the central bankers in
[02:52:53.880 --> 02:53:01.320]  charge crazy thank you noel wow simply amazing that we've gotten to this point peter i don't
[02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:05.640]  even like to put dates on it but how long can this go on i know i keep going back to that question
[02:53:05.640 --> 02:53:10.120]  but i mean we already see the economies in trouble a lot of areas of the world it's a war zone total
[02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:15.320]  depression people starving to death clearly the world's in crisis but how long until people
[02:53:15.320 --> 02:53:20.200]  in the united states figure that out well look obviously a lot longer than i thought i mean
[02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:24.200]  years ago i would have thought we would have been further along in the learning curve by now
[02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:28.520]  but i think it's going to be a lot sooner than some people think is there people that think oh
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:33.480]  yeah you know but it's a problem for our grandchildren that yes it's going to come apart
[02:53:33.480 --> 02:53:37.880]  eventually but we'll all be dead by then so the people who think that this is not going to happen
[02:53:37.880 --> 02:53:42.360]  until the middle of the century i think they're going to be surprised by how quickly it happens
[02:53:42.360 --> 02:53:46.600]  we're getting close like you and i you know we've been waiting for this day i mean we figured it
[02:53:46.600 --> 02:53:51.560]  out a long time ago and and and yet you know it continues and that is the problem with these
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:57.160]  bubbles because you have this shared psychology and it feeds on itself and the bigger the bubble is
[02:53:57.720 --> 02:54:03.000]  the bigger it can get is it a too big to fail bubble i mean the too big to fail bubble
[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:07.880]  the mega bubble it's too big to fail it's not too big to fail it's too big to fail
[02:54:07.880 --> 02:54:13.720]  when this bubble bursts this final bubble that is it we can't do anything about it anymore we
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:18.680]  can't delay the day of reckoning we can't kick the can down a road again so this is the economic mega
[02:54:18.680 --> 02:54:24.280]  event this is the big one i think i think the next one is the big one and then the question is
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:29.720]  how much time do we have i don't know i just want to make sure that i'm prepared for it
[02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:34.200]  even if i have to prepare early because preparing early is the only way to prepare
[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:39.000]  because you can't do it late because there's no time good god it's we're sitting on top of time
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:44.600]  bomb i've got children you've got children i just and we're informed and don't know what to do
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:49.240]  imagine the general public when this time bomb when this balloon goes up it is going to be
[02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:56.920]  bedlam a wild in wisconsin thanks for holding her on the air go ahead hey mr jones mr chiff
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:04.360]  my topic is kind of on judgment and it's interesting with mr schiff being on first of all i think
[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:11.560]  it's interesting that people have not taken consideration the possibility of the u.s possibly
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:17.400]  being able to pay off their debt in full which i know sounds extreme but with technology around
[02:55:17.400 --> 02:55:24.520]  the corner like mem riskers gravity technology and different energy availability that is a possibility
[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:30.120]  that should be taken consideration well we could innovate out of this but the central banks want
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:34.760]  to keep a center economic control and bondage that's a great point thanks for that point what
[02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:40.040]  about innovating out of this tree that but we can't because the trajectory of the debt is too great
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:45.880]  and of course the only thing that's keeping it uh manageable is the zero percent interest rates so
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:50.360]  when the fed raises interest rates and the deficits keep growing you know you're talking about an
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:55.320]  exponential increase in the cost of servicing that debt we cannot innovate our way out of it we
[02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:59.960]  cannot produce our way out of it we have to deal with it through we structure through default we
[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:04.920]  have to admit that we've borrowed more than we can repay you know one of the reasons that we have
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:09.480]  interest rates so low is because we don't want to admit that but that is screwing up the economy
[02:56:09.480 --> 02:56:15.000]  even more so the longer we try to pretend we're solvent the more unsolved we become and the
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:20.360]  weaker we make our economy because we need a strong economy because once you know once the music stops
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:25.320]  here and once we default on all this debt you know we're in a big hole we got to get our way out of
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:29.960]  it yeah the service economy we're gonna start it as we don't get something set up the service economy
[02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:33.160]  won't work anymore we're gonna have to be a production economy we're gonna have to make
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:37.080]  stuff we're gonna have to build things we're gonna have to produce things and how are we gonna do that
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:41.000]  you know that's not easy to do if it was easy everybody would do it if it was easy there'd be
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:45.640]  no poverty in africa let's take a call from africa should have gone earlier this caller
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:53.800]  patriot in africa you're on the air go ahead um yeah i'm calling from zambia welcome
[02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:59.160]  country's just being crippled economically and the country's currency is lost over half

[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:12.360]  national i d cards what can someone do to prepare economically for what's coming in the future that's
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:17.160]  a really great question you really got a great connection from africa is that i mean is he talking

[02:57:27.480 --> 02:57:33.320]  zambia what do i do yeah well i mean i mean obviously there you know you can leave i mean
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:36.920]  that's what one of the things that people do sometimes is they just get up and leave if they
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:42.760]  don't see any any any resolution in sight but i think more and more people around the world are
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:46.760]  going to be having to be faced with with that reality and the problems that you're that you're
[02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:51.880]  living with there are a function of government these are not natural disasters these are man-made
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:56.920]  problems that are the consequence of government controlling an economy and government trying to
[02:57:56.920 --> 02:58:03.320]  allocate wealth and and set prices and yeah the president's son of of equatorial you know
[02:58:03.320 --> 02:58:10.200]  guinea having a hundred ferrari's yeah i mean so but this this mentality of government look look

[02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:19.800]  want to rebrand it it's all the same thing that the government knows best and it penalizes production

[03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:43.560]  all the other big sites uh and we're also thinking we're going to create a kind of low tech news feed
[03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:48.280]  page that doesn't rip off drugs because i don't want to do that but kind of just has all the stories
[03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:53.960]  on one page as they kind of feed in three columns maybe two columns i'm going to make it look different
[03:00:53.960 --> 03:00:57.880]  than drugs that's something else we're going to do for folks that want to get that view of it
[03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:02.120]  because that's kind of a view i like but this is the one that's modern that everybody uses

[03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:34.040]  pricing and you support the tip of the spear but patriot in africa when i hear somebody like you
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:42.440]  you calling in uh so many great people across the world that have been basically still under
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:48.040]  colonialism that's what globalism is just modern corporate colonialism masquerading is liberal
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:52.680]  and i just think about all the giant populations in the third world
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:58.280]  that want a better life and if they hadn't set up all this welfare when people come in
[03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:04.200]  and to then turn them into little socialist bots i would say even have bigger populations come in
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:11.080]  from places like africa the problem is we're collapsing as well in our poor and lower middle
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:16.920]  class areas but also the rich areas in many areas are just becoming extinct it's a fundamental
[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:23.160]  global crisis and to hear you ask me you know what do you do in your country you know better than i
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:29.960]  because you're on the ground but um i think what shift said you know get out of there
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:33.800]  but then so many people are fleeing hundreds of millions the third world are trying to get out
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:39.560]  right now uh i don't know what you do quite frankly and i'm kind of in the same position
[03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:46.120]  i don't know how to get ready or deal with all this and because this is going to be so bad i mean
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:51.240]  as you said i've read about your country unraveling when it unravels here it's going to be even worse
[03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:56.280]  because people that haven't had a lot at least know how to grow a garden or you know have some
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:02.360]  chickens or whatever um here when stuff unravels if it gets really bad we're talking about mass
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:09.560]  starvation so it's a time bomb and i know the elites know it's a time bomb so let me ask you
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:14.280]  what do you think living there people are going to do is this thing gets worse i mean are you
[03:03:14.280 --> 03:03:20.760]  agreeing that you're seeing the global depression where you're at yeah the global depression
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:27.240]  it's full full blown um the real estate market is booming though but i mean but what do you do i mean
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:33.560]  everywhere people just start in the currency just in freefall and i also know europe's
[03:03:33.560 --> 03:03:39.480]  collapsing cloward and piven all of that so cloward and piven brother cloward and piven exactly the
[03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:44.760]  elite they make money off the real estate going off but everything else just screws everybody
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:52.440]  they want to make everybody poor so they can run your life that's that's exactly i mean africa is so
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:59.320]  rich it has more resources than any any continent like times three and you just cannot seem to ever
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:04.280]  get going and it's because of colonialism and then the colonialists as you know pulled out
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:12.120]  but then they put strong men in and then manage them and you all you have is colonialism by robot
[03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:16.040]  dictator basically that's what's happening so how do you how do you deal with that
[03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:22.520]  yeah how do you deal with being a debt colony of imf i mean
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:31.480]  you get rid of the imf and you you set up your own systems and you work in a federation in africa
[03:04:32.040 --> 03:04:37.240]  and that was starting to happen oh but they blew up libya and kill kadafi i'm sorry and i'm not
[03:04:37.240 --> 03:04:41.400]  defending apartheid it was one evil they replaced it with something even worse they blew out the
[03:04:41.400 --> 03:04:45.960]  engines of the north and south of africa and now africa is in freefall and the globalists can come
[03:04:45.960 --> 03:04:50.840]  in just like grace and buy it all up we're all in this together brother we'll work on it appreciate

[03:08:12.360 --> 03:08:17.480]  the fourth overdrive hour of the alex jones show i'm anthony gucciardi your host for the
[03:08:17.480 --> 03:08:23.000]  rest of the hour there's a lot of news that alex didn't get a chance to get to a lot of analysis
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:28.680]  and a lot of special reports and videos that we're going to break including some new information
[03:08:28.680 --> 03:08:37.080]  on the russian plane as well as gun control lies a new video detailing what leon did recently that
[03:08:37.080 --> 03:08:43.000]  was dramatic and changed her life and a bunch of others as well including new threats of an emp
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:50.520]  attack so first and foremost the biggest headline out today of course is that ben carson is admitting
[03:08:50.520 --> 03:08:55.960]  his fabricated west point story and that is as you're probably most likely already aware
[03:08:55.960 --> 03:09:02.360]  where he claimed that he applied and was accepted at west point and met with these top generals
[03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:07.800]  and all of this and that brings into question his other stories which he's now defending
[03:09:07.800 --> 03:09:13.560]  in some bizarre headlines including ben carson's troubled effort to prove that he was in fact
[03:09:13.560 --> 03:09:19.080]  a juvenile delinquent and from the washington post it says well this is a new one we are
[03:09:19.080 --> 03:09:23.560]  accustomed to the media probing our politicians past reporting on some skeletons in the closet
[03:09:23.560 --> 03:09:28.200]  then bracing for the almost inevitable response from the press accounts or erroneous biased
[03:09:28.200 --> 03:09:32.360]  or completely fabricated but in the case of ben carson versus cnn we have a media outlet saying
[03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:37.880]  maybe he really wasn't such a bad guy and a president presidential candidate saying oh yes
[03:09:37.880 --> 03:09:43.720]  i was and here's what's really happening here the candidates or at least their staffers whoever
[03:09:43.720 --> 03:09:54.200]  is the brains of the organization have realized that being real is the best way to gain mobility
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:09:59.000]  and gain attention and gain popularity or at least perceiving people perceiving you as
[03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:13.160]  alexis by people others aren't 100 percent so political and statesman and standing there oh
[03:10:13.160 --> 03:10:19.400]  yes and ben carson's issue has always been that he is he kind of is so squeaky clean seeming
[03:10:19.400 --> 03:10:24.200]  so if he loses this image that he's putting out there that yeah i was bad kid i his story was
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:28.360]  that he almost killed one of his best friends until he turned you know good and went into the
[03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:34.120]  went to the the military and all this kind of stuff so if he loses this idea of him having
[03:10:34.120 --> 03:10:39.640]  some rough edges and being real then he loses everything and i think trump realizes that and
[03:10:39.640 --> 03:10:48.120]  that's why he's so popular because at the end of the day people don't want a phony fake puppet
[03:10:48.120 --> 03:10:52.920]  they want someone that is real someone that curses sometimes someone that has made mistakes
[03:10:52.920 --> 03:11:00.920]  and someone that is relatable and even i made the mistake years ago thinking that i had to
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:07.480]  present myself differently and and sit there in a perfect posture and say hello today we have
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:14.280]  coming out today but in reality people want someone that is 100 real even if they're not perfect
[03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:17.800]  even if they're willing to make mistakes even if they admit they've made mistakes in the past
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:22.920]  and that is the most important thing and that's what we're seeing with ben carson you know
[03:11:24.520 --> 03:11:29.320]  talk about artificial intelligence a lot especially uh sometimes when i'm hosting the
[03:11:29.320 --> 03:11:33.720]  program because it's something i'm really interested in toyota is investing one billion
[03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:40.520]  dollars in becoming an artificial intelligence company toyota this is from gizmodo cars are
[03:11:40.520 --> 03:11:45.240]  either going to poison us with secret emissions or just drive themselves so it's no surprise that
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:50.440]  car manufacturers are looking to branch out in toyota's case that takes the form of a one billion
[03:11:50.440 --> 03:11:55.560]  dollar investment in a silicon valley ai research center the new toyota research center institute
[03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:59.800]  will be located near stanford in silicon valley with 200 employees working on a range of robotics
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:06.600]  and ai research not just loaned to cars you know i actually have a cold today a little bit of a
[03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:10.680]  runny nose and i haven't been sick in years and that's it kind of freaks me out and i realized
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:17.240]  it was because i am working and stressed out and not sleeping right and it also kind of reminded
[03:12:17.240 --> 03:12:22.120]  me how the body at the most biological level responds to sickness and i'm tying this into
[03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:28.440]  what i just read if you have a small cold it's your body telling you hey you need to get your
[03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:32.040]  stuff together you need to check out your immune system you need to figure out what you're doing
[03:12:32.040 --> 03:12:36.360]  and stressing yourself out this is just a friendly little reminder a friendly little
[03:12:36.360 --> 03:12:41.400]  slap on the wrist saying hey get yourself together you've got a cold you're doing something wrong
[03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:49.560]  this country has experienced much more than a cold but i see the i see the cold i see the
[03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:53.480]  the little illness coming with the artificial intelligence community speaking out kind of
[03:12:53.480 --> 03:12:59.560]  like a warning to the immune system of this species saying hey you really need to get this
[03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:04.200]  in order you really need to get this in check before something really really bad happens
[03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:10.760]  and i see all the big players spending billions of dollars from google to toyota to apple
[03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:16.440]  spending billions of dollars to launch artificial intelligence systems and i see elon musk who is
[03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:23.800]  actually an amazing person in my view saying that we need to keep this in check thousands of
[03:13:23.800 --> 03:13:29.000]  professors from major universities and researchers major university saying we need to keep this in
[03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:35.240]  check because we have a cold at this point but we're not doing anything to address the issues
[03:13:35.240 --> 03:13:40.600]  and more and more as it gets more out of bounds and more insane and the genetic modification ramp
[03:13:40.600 --> 03:13:46.040]  keeps ramping up and it turns into biopharmaceutical crops where vaccines and pharmaceuticals are
[03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:51.480]  grown in the crops themselves with stuff syngenta has been doing and others we need to address the
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:57.240]  cold that this planet is facing right now in so many different ways but artificial intelligence
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:14:04.360]  is absolutely one of them now i want to go ahead and run to a report by john bound on the russian
[03:14:04.360 --> 03:14:08.840]  plane on some new things that we hadn't realized yet some breaking news on the russian plane that
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:13.320]  everyone is talking about and we'll be back with more news let's check this out okay intelligence
[03:14:13.320 --> 03:14:17.960]  officials announced wednesday morning that in all likelihood a bomb causing the downing of
[03:14:17.960 --> 03:14:25.240]  metro jet flight 92 68 which broke apart in midair after departing from sharm el shake egypt the
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:33.400]  resulting crash killed all 224 people on board responding to claims from senior uk and us officials
[03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:39.640]  that there is significant evidence that the plane was down by a bomb on board former ambassador to
[03:14:39.640 --> 03:14:46.760]  the un and arch neocon john bolton said hooten now will retaliate and he won't mess around like
[03:14:46.760 --> 03:14:53.640]  president obama has done it will be i think extraordinarily massive he will probably beef
[03:14:53.640 --> 03:15:00.440]  up his air assets in the new latakia airbase and when they're ready i think there will be punishing
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:05.960]  retribution prime minister david cameron's office said in a statement as more information has come
[03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:10.920]  to light we've become concerned that the plane may well have been brought down by an explosive
[03:15:10.920 --> 03:15:16.840]  device us officials have also touted the notion that someone on the inside could have smuggled
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:22.760]  an explosive device onto the plane the official said this airport has lack security it's known for
[03:15:22.760 --> 03:15:28.440]  that but there is intelligence suggesting an assist from someone at the airport with the
[03:15:28.440 --> 03:15:33.480]  obama administration remaining tight lipped on speculation surrounding what caused the downing
[03:15:33.480 --> 03:15:41.080]  of metro jet flight 92 68 one source suggests a muslim brotherhood link could be the reason
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:46.840]  behind the silence british prime minister david cameron has been vocal in asserting that a bomb
[03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:52.600]  on board was a likely cause for the plane crash moving to suspend all flights from charm el shake
[03:15:52.600 --> 03:15:58.280]  but president barack obama has refused to explicitly comment on the cause of the disaster
[03:15:58.280 --> 03:16:03.240]  that could be due to concerns that the muslim brotherhood which has enjoyed close ties with
[03:16:03.240 --> 03:16:09.720]  the administration in the past is responsible for the terror attack reports the dc whispers
[03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:15.240]  website one dc whispers source went so far as to suggest part of the obama administration's
[03:16:15.240 --> 03:16:21.080]  hesitation to make public statements regarding the russian airline tragedy is based upon concerns
[03:16:21.080 --> 03:16:26.040]  there is a muslim brotherhood connection and that measures are being taken by administration
[03:16:26.040 --> 03:16:32.040]  officials to make certain no such connection if in fact it exists will become part of the
[03:16:32.040 --> 03:16:39.160]  investigation reports dc whispers known for their access to inside sources in 2014 it
[03:16:39.160 --> 03:16:45.400]  emerged that the department of homeland security maintains a hands-off list of individuals with
[03:16:45.400 --> 03:16:51.800]  terrorist ties allowing them unfettered entrance to the united states muslim brotherhood members
[03:16:51.800 --> 03:16:57.880]  with ties to terrorism who traveled through minneapolis airport new york's jfk airport
[03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:04.040]  and dullis airport in april 2012 were handed port courtesies with the state department telling the
[03:17:04.040 --> 03:17:11.960]  dhs to ensure the men not be pulled into secondary upon arrival at a point of entry last year retired
[03:17:11.960 --> 03:17:18.280]  us air force general tom mckinnery also made the explosive claim that there were at least 10 or 15
[03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:23.560]  muslim brotherhood sympathizers working for the state department look the middle east is coming
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:28.360]  apart with this administration's policy look at libya we should never have gone into libya
[03:17:28.360 --> 03:17:33.640]  qaddafi was on our side look at egypt morsey is now going after the muslim brotherhood
[03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:39.960]  and the radical islamists and we've got muslim brotherhood in the u.s. government today and and
[03:17:39.960 --> 03:17:45.000]  so wait who's going on who from the muslim brotherhood is in the u.s. government right now
[03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:52.520]  who yes oh look i haven't got their names exactly but there's a list of them at least 10 or 15 of
[03:17:52.520 --> 03:17:58.600]  in february this year 14 individuals with ties to the muslim brotherhood visited the white house
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:05.240]  and met directly with president obama meanwhile russia and egypt are still refusing to acknowledge
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:11.240]  that the disaster was a terrorist attack despite an abundance of evidence suggesting the plane
[03:18:11.240 --> 03:18:17.480]  blew up in midair after a sudden explosion john bound for info wars dot com that's right you
[03:18:17.480 --> 03:18:24.360]  can see john bound's report on alex's youtube channel entitled russian passenger jet explodes
[03:18:24.360 --> 03:18:30.920]  obama silent and isn't it amazing that we've lost so much faith and trust in not only the united
[03:18:30.920 --> 03:18:35.080]  state's government but the mainstream media and the media at large that i was actually
[03:18:35.080 --> 03:18:40.600]  speaking to someone out at a public place the other day and i was overhearing the conversation i
[03:18:40.600 --> 03:18:45.320]  had to join in they were saying that who knows what happened to the plane because we literally
[03:18:45.320 --> 03:18:51.160]  can't trust anything that the media or the u.s. government says and i found that to be 100% the
[03:18:51.160 --> 03:18:58.360]  case the view of pretty much anyone that's listening these days and isn't it interesting that isis is
[03:18:58.360 --> 03:19:04.840]  just the perfect boogeyman it's even better in al qaeda because everyone hates isis so much you
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:11.160]  could say isis i mean you could go to someone's house and rob them blind and blow their house up
[03:19:11.160 --> 03:19:17.800]  and just say isis did it isis did that like oh my god isis did that you could say isis did anything
[03:19:17.800 --> 03:19:22.440]  it's it's the ultimate scapegoat because everyone just gets this oh well it sounds like that i mean
[03:19:22.440 --> 03:19:29.960]  they're crazy they cut people's heads off it is the most amazing potential scapegoat out there but

[03:24:09.880 --> 03:24:15.720]  welcome back to the fourth hour of Overdrive in the Alex Jones show I'm Anthony Gucciardi with you
[03:24:15.720 --> 03:24:22.280]  for the rest of the show and remember when we used to talk about genetic modification and where
[03:24:22.280 --> 03:24:27.240]  it would be going if we didn't keep in check the level of genetic modification that we're
[03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:33.320]  experiencing today and by the way that doesn't mean stop the science of genetic modification
[03:24:33.320 --> 03:24:39.000]  it means look into it and make sure we're doing it in the right ways not killing people not harming
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:44.520]  the planet not using things like Monsanto's glyphosate based Roundup which has been shown
[03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:49.640]  by the World Health Organization and others to be a probable carcinogen worth looking into
[03:24:49.640 --> 03:24:56.440]  to and create super weeds that destroys farms and destroys crops and really messes everything up
[03:24:56.440 --> 03:25:01.800]  and we have United Nations studies showing that organic or natural based farming can even outperform
[03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:07.240]  GMOs in many cases that's the kind of stuff we need to look at before getting into things like this
[03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:13.160]  NPR should human stem cells be used to make partly human chimeras obviously it's not directly
[03:25:13.160 --> 03:25:18.040]  related to GMOs but it is genetic modification bioengineering field and we're running rampant
[03:25:18.040 --> 03:25:22.840]  just like we are with artificial intelligence without any checks and bounds even though scientists
[03:25:22.840 --> 03:25:27.560]  are freaking out an intense debate has spread over whether the federal government should fund
[03:25:27.560 --> 03:25:32.280]  research that creates partly human creatures using human stem cells the national institutes of
[03:25:32.280 --> 03:25:37.400]  health declared a moratorium in late september on funding this kind of research NIH officials say
[03:25:37.400 --> 03:25:42.920]  they needed to assess the science and to evaluate the ethical and moral questions it raises as part
[03:25:42.920 --> 03:25:49.240]  of the assessment the NIH is holding a daylong workshop friday goes on to have both sides the
[03:25:49.240 --> 03:25:53.640]  science is knocking in our door one of the scientists filled shots in advance of the workshop
[03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:58.120]  says the NIH wants to make sure that we are fully prepared from a policy and guidance point of view
[03:25:59.320 --> 03:26:05.240]  you know time and time again we talk about these things years and years before and people freak
[03:26:05.240 --> 03:26:08.920]  out and they say it's not even a possibility and that's why we can't have a real debate on these
[03:26:08.920 --> 03:26:14.360]  things that's why we can't have real checks and balances just like these stories here report
[03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:20.920]  finds phone apps regularly spy on users university study shows how devices betray us
[03:26:21.560 --> 03:26:26.120]  apps on apple and android smartphones leak lots of users information to third parties research
[03:26:26.120 --> 03:26:32.600]  has suggested researchers from mit harvard and carnecke in universities conspiracy theorists
[03:26:32.600 --> 03:26:37.960]  universities studied 110 apps available on google play in the apple store they found 73
[03:26:37.960 --> 03:26:43.160]  percent of the android app shared users email addresses and 47 percent of ios shared location
[03:26:43.160 --> 03:26:51.400]  data so there was more evidence that these devices quote unquote betray us they absolutely do betray
[03:26:51.400 --> 03:26:57.160]  us and we have no idea what we're getting ourselves into when we sign off myself included by the way
[03:26:57.160 --> 03:27:02.680]  on the terms of service that is 55 pages long that would take a degree in six years of your life to
[03:27:02.680 --> 03:27:09.320]  read and we swipe absolutely yes sign me up give me the app whatever google maps tracks everything
[03:27:09.320 --> 03:27:14.120]  we do that's totally fine but you know what we don't even have to have a we're not allowed to
[03:27:14.120 --> 03:27:18.760]  have a debate on that something else that might be coming on the horizon is apparently based on
[03:27:18.760 --> 03:27:23.560]  some information in emp and we're looking at what might actually happen we have a special report
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:33.320]  trailer it's going to premiere tonight here is the trailer for the emp possibility war pandemic economic

[03:27:43.800 --> 03:27:51.560]  reasons to prepare for times of crisis this list however is excluding the worst-case scenario
[03:27:51.560 --> 03:28:00.120]  which is also the most likely to occur emp or an electromagnetic pulse whether such a disaster
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:07.160]  is caused by a terror attack or nature the results will be unimaginable no lights no

[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:37.560]  will ultimately break down a 2008 study predicts that in the case of such an event 90 percent of

[03:29:54.040 --> 03:30:03.720]  network ran paul look where isis gets its weapons from they have anti-tank weapons and missiles
[03:30:03.720 --> 03:30:08.840]  that we gave them article up by steve watson presidential candidate ron paul has urged voters
[03:30:08.840 --> 03:30:13.720]  to look to where isis is getting its weapons from to understand the monumental problem the
[03:30:13.720 --> 03:30:19.800]  us is facilitating in syria and beyond speaking with ed brliner of newsmax paul stated most of
[03:30:19.800 --> 03:30:24.600]  these people do not have the sophistication to make arms so they get the arms from other folks
[03:30:24.600 --> 03:30:29.080]  right now isis has over a billion dollars worth of u.s humvees and they have a billion dollars in
[03:30:29.080 --> 03:30:34.120]  cash they stole from us so really if we don't want weapons to get into the hands of folks we should
[03:30:34.120 --> 03:30:39.560]  be very careful about who we give the weapons to the senator stated paul then elaborated by noting
[03:30:39.560 --> 03:30:46.040]  that during the libyan civil war 15 000 shoulder to air missiles made by the united states went
[03:30:46.040 --> 03:30:52.200]  missing that's why there is a concern that airliners might be taken down by shoulder to air

[03:37:12.360 --> 03:37:16.840]  we're not using pharmaceutical drugs we're not you know i i've seen so many posts of people
[03:37:16.840 --> 03:37:20.840]  getting their gallbladders taken out and and people don't understand like it's not like your
[03:37:20.840 --> 03:37:25.880]  wisdom teeth like your gallbladder is a huge horse organ along with your liver that cleanses your
[03:37:25.880 --> 03:37:33.080]  body and you can't just take that out because it helps cleanse the body so why not try a cleanse
[03:37:33.080 --> 03:37:37.160]  and get rid of the stuff in the gallbladder as promised we are checking in for day four of the
[03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:43.400]  info wars life liver shield cleanse i gotta say i mean you were right day four i feel tremendous
[03:37:43.400 --> 03:37:50.200]  woke up this morning feeling really light uh a lot of clarity i had no hunger pains and i actually
[03:37:50.200 --> 03:37:55.160]  felt like i was floating through the grocery store everyone was sort of looking at me like oh pardon
[03:37:55.160 --> 03:38:01.000]  me oh excuse me and i wasn't in there cute or anything like it just was like i feel like i
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:05.800]  am glowing and you're not even that hungry right no not at all i didn't even want to eat today
[03:38:05.800 --> 03:38:10.920]  because i felt so good yeah so obviously this cleanse for me has really showed me that it is
[03:38:10.920 --> 03:38:16.440]  all about retraining our brain like i said how can you resist tyranny if you can't resist the taco
[03:38:16.440 --> 03:38:21.000]  stand now if you want to see our before and after photos i think they said they've got them ready
[03:38:21.800 --> 03:38:27.880]  like i said mine aren't before and almost after because i'm not done with my flush but you can
[03:38:27.880 --> 03:38:36.440]  see those if you go to info wars dot com forward slash show whoa emmy flat and i was i promise you
[03:38:36.440 --> 03:38:42.200]  i promise you i was not sticking out in that first picture i just literally was relaxed and even in
[03:38:42.200 --> 03:38:48.680]  the second picture i was relaxed but like looking really it's crazy i can see in my back side no i
[03:38:48.680 --> 03:38:54.120]  know i can see the muscles in my stomach it's nuts in my legs i feel like my legs look skinnier
[03:38:54.120 --> 03:39:00.520]  i don't know i i started off at like a i mean for my height i'm almost five nine so i started off at
[03:39:01.320 --> 03:39:05.320]  relatively healthy weight because i had done the liver cleanse in july and then i went straight
[03:39:05.320 --> 03:39:09.800]  into working and on a production for three months where i was working 18 hour days on my feet doing
[03:39:09.800 --> 03:39:13.640]  like eight miles a day so i mean i wasn't super out of shape but when i started that first liver
[03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:18.040]  cleanse i was pretty out of shape so that before yeah you said you're actually at the lowest weight
[03:39:18.040 --> 03:39:23.560]  of your well pretty much in a decade i guess yeah pretty much i'm almost back to where when i was a
[03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:28.280]  fitness model which would do they have do they have mine before and almost after's are we gonna
[03:39:28.280 --> 03:39:34.840]  hold those off oh my goodness gracious moly look at you yeah i can see it in your arms where and
[03:39:34.840 --> 03:39:39.960]  your legs well where i really see it and where i really wanted it was in my sides i guess you would
[03:39:39.960 --> 03:39:45.480]  call that the spare tire and you can actually see where there's that little roll oh my god this is
[03:39:45.480 --> 03:39:51.080]  so embarrassing there's that little roll kind of on the like the back fat and you can see it's it's
[03:39:51.080 --> 03:39:56.600]  gone away look below your chin though oh my gosh you see you lose a little bit in your face too
[03:39:56.600 --> 03:40:00.760]  that's where i saw it big time the first time around there you go everyone before and after's
[03:40:00.760 --> 03:40:05.320]  and like i said mine is not even after yet i should probably take more pictures later when

[03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:54.520]  and this was just handed to me we're not going to have time to read the whole thing
[03:40:54.520 --> 03:41:01.160]  but tpp text finally released it's even worse than we thought and i thought it was pretty bad so
[03:41:01.720 --> 03:41:05.960]  as we've noted in hundreds of articles the trans-pacific partnership is a horrible pact
[03:41:05.960 --> 03:41:10.680]  which would destroy everything that america stands for and they go on and on to cite it and cite it
[03:41:10.680 --> 03:41:15.800]  it could also affect and reduce our food safety the tpp is absolutely demonic and i hope it will
[03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:21.160]  be defeated in every possible way va wrongly tells veterans they're dead cuts off benefits
[03:41:21.160 --> 03:41:27.400]  quote i woke up this morning and i'm feeling rather chipper mike reaker a 69-year-old vietnam
[03:41:27.400 --> 03:41:31.880]  navy veteran relies on his veterans affairs benefits to get him through the month that's why
[03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:37.800]  the panellists county florida resident was alarmed when his va check didn't show up in his bank
[03:41:37.800 --> 03:41:42.840]  account monday he called the department of veteran affairs to find out why their response was stunning
[03:41:42.840 --> 03:41:49.160]  the benefits had been suspended because he was dead well i'm not reaker reported i woke up this
[03:41:49.160 --> 03:41:53.720]  morning i'm feeling rather chipper chipper so it turns out reaker is one of the six tampa bay
[03:41:53.720 --> 03:42:00.920]  residents who were getting well cuts off but i guess they were considered dead by the va because
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:07.480]  it is a horribly ineffective and bloated bureaucratic government arm just like most of the government
[03:42:07.480 --> 03:42:13.080]  arms and it's further evidence that people are completely fed up and done with most of the government
[03:42:13.080 --> 03:42:20.200]  systems that we pay for that are complete failures and it leads me into my next topic of discussion
[03:42:20.200 --> 03:42:27.000]  which is the biggest threat we face right now and the biggest threat we face is not on a micro
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:33.000]  level so people say oh the biggest threat we face is you know this section of the economy you know
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:38.760]  federal reserve whatever it is or the biggest threat we face is the environment dying or the
[03:42:38.760 --> 03:42:44.280]  biggest threat we face is the food supply all these are huge threats right but the biggest
[03:42:44.280 --> 03:42:53.240]  threat we actually face is apathy and defeat through getting so upset that we don't care anymore
[03:42:53.240 --> 03:42:58.280]  which is really a form of apathy but it's really a form of defeat because what's happening is
[03:42:58.280 --> 03:43:04.840]  all these headlines every single day that we read when we go on cnn it's all just rough
[03:43:04.840 --> 03:43:09.560]  negative junk about how we're being attacked on a daily basis va just telling people they're
[03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:13.560]  dead because they can't get anything right raw milk farmer jailed for removing government
[03:43:13.560 --> 03:43:18.120]  surveillance cameras from his own property they arrested him he was found he found out they were
[03:43:18.120 --> 03:43:22.200]  surveilling him on his property he had some spy cams everywhere so he took him down like oh what's
[03:43:22.200 --> 03:43:28.200]  this they arrested him for theft I mean Ben Carson is is lying about his past and everything like
[03:43:28.200 --> 03:43:34.920]  that to try and fit in it's all just craziness immigrants three million more migrants could
[03:43:34.920 --> 03:43:40.600]  arrive by the end of 2016 into the EU more than 700,000 people have come to Europe seeking sanctuary
[03:43:40.600 --> 03:43:45.640]  or jobs so far this year all it does is kind of hit you like a sledgehammer and it makes you want
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:51.960]  to give up and it makes you not want to care and the very essence of change is giving a crap
[03:43:51.960 --> 03:43:57.160]  I mean activism is kind of another way of saying I give a crap I care about the future of this planet
[03:43:57.160 --> 03:44:04.120]  and when we lose activists and we lose the spirit of activism that's stripped away from us by this
[03:44:04.120 --> 03:44:09.960]  consistent attack through the media establishment telling us that we're losing through the insane
[03:44:09.960 --> 03:44:14.600]  stuff that's happening on a daily basis we lose the ability to change and what I'm getting at
[03:44:14.600 --> 03:44:20.040]  is it's not just about changing the federal reserve it's not just about changing the food supply
[03:44:20.040 --> 03:44:26.120]  it's not just about fighting and changing even in the alternative media it's about the spirit
[03:44:26.120 --> 03:44:32.440]  of change that we have lost and when we give up and we assume defeat because we can't handle
[03:44:32.440 --> 03:44:39.960]  these headlines that's when we lose that is the directive of those that would like to take control
[03:44:39.960 --> 03:44:46.280]  of us and take control of the entire planet essentially in some ways they want you defeated
[03:44:46.840 --> 03:44:51.480]  so to give up and to give up your spirit of activism is total defeat in every single way
[03:44:51.480 --> 03:44:55.080]  and I'm encouraging you to stand up even with all these headlines because there is
[03:44:55.080 --> 03:44:58.920]  good out there and we can still fix it we can still do something about it but the biggest
[03:44:58.920 --> 03:45:07.720]  threat is apathy when you walk around and downtown wherever you live or in your local area you see
[03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:14.200]  people that are walking around and they're just like almost bumping into each other they're almost
[03:45:14.200 --> 03:45:20.200]  not even aware of what's three feet in front of them they've just given up it's not even that they're
[03:45:20.200 --> 03:45:26.600]  stupid it's not even that that they're they're physically inferior or something they just don't
[03:45:26.600 --> 03:45:31.000]  care I mean you could you can see some pretty quote-unquote normal looking people just walking
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:35.880]  around like like zombies I'm not not sitting here judging these people I probably look like an idiot
[03:45:35.880 --> 03:45:40.440]  sometimes too but I mean these people that don't care anymore and you can talk to them and you can
[03:45:40.440 --> 03:45:46.200]  see the passion has been lost in their eyes you can see that they're walking around just buying
[03:45:46.200 --> 03:45:51.960]  their processed foods at the grocery store they're walking around just being sold things
[03:45:51.960 --> 03:45:57.400]  they're walking around consuming everything they're walking around just doing nothing
[03:45:57.400 --> 03:46:02.760]  they don't have ambitions what do you want to do with your life I don't know they're just walking
[03:46:02.760 --> 03:46:07.880]  around hating other people there's there's been times when I've had to go to Walmart unfortunately
[03:46:08.760 --> 03:46:14.200]  and I see people to pick up something quick in an area that doesn't have many grocery stores or
[03:46:14.200 --> 03:46:19.080]  whatever and there's people bumping into each other walking into each other they don't even have
[03:46:19.080 --> 03:46:23.480]  enough spatial awareness to realize that there's someone one foot in front of them so they hit
[03:46:23.480 --> 03:46:29.640]  them with a cart or something that is the result not of just dumbing down with the food additives
[03:46:29.640 --> 03:46:34.840]  and stuff that's true too but the result of giving up because it seems like a lost cause
[03:46:34.840 --> 03:46:40.360]  that is the worst thing you could possibly ever do for yourself and for the future of the species
[03:46:40.360 --> 03:46:45.240]  and this planet as a whole you just can't give up or you will turn into a zombie-like creature
[03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:49.720]  let's go ahead and read a couple more articles and then I have another special report for you
[03:46:49.720 --> 03:46:57.800]  from John Bound about being disarmed and some real stats he says on gun control but first let's talk
[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:05.480]  about this bank of Ireland bans small cash withdrawals at branches coins and notes are in fact
[03:47:05.480 --> 03:47:12.520]  anachronism as central planners the the world over as central planners the world over grapple with
[03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:17.880]  these this is an interestingly written article anyway we've been told time and time again that
[03:47:17.880 --> 03:47:22.520]  the banks are our friends that they love us they'll never do anything bad to us but time and time
[03:47:22.520 --> 03:47:27.720]  again it all begins with the small cash it all begins with Bank of America for example saying
[03:47:27.720 --> 03:47:33.160]  that they don't accept cash deposits in certain amounts it all begins with banks that I've gone
[03:47:33.160 --> 03:47:39.240]  to as well giving me trouble about cash and it all begins with them saying at the same time that
[03:47:39.240 --> 03:47:45.240]  they're not going to do anything about it just as that happens with gun control just as they start
[03:47:45.240 --> 03:47:49.400]  with saying that well we just want to check guns we want to register guns we want to do this and
[03:47:49.400 --> 03:47:54.040]  then certain states got we want to take your guns and ultimately it's over and over and over again
[03:47:54.040 --> 03:48:01.800]  these little micro tears at the embryo of what is freedom in all its ways are pricked into so here's
[03:48:01.800 --> 03:48:07.880]  john bounds report on disarming america in an article from kit daniels of info wars dot com
[03:48:07.880 --> 03:48:12.680]  an anti-gun group released a video yesterday mocking the second amendment but the video's
[03:48:12.680 --> 03:48:18.520]  so bad it's hilarious to watch before now it's been difficult for criminals like us to know which
[03:48:18.520 --> 03:48:23.160]  states have loose gun laws that's why i love arizona where i can go see the beautiful grand
[03:48:23.160 --> 03:48:28.680]  canyon and carry a loaded gun without even having to get a background check nevada what happens in
[03:48:28.680 --> 03:48:33.960]  vegas may have to stay in vegas but your guns don't bring them over to california and sell them
[03:48:33.960 --> 03:48:40.280]  the market up there is hungry hungry for guns alifornia connecticut maryland and new york
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:48.760]  all have laws to keep guns out of the hands of people like us hi okay california may 23rd 2014
[03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:54.440]  massive gun free zone in santa barbara allows self-absorbed nutcase eliot roger to stab three
[03:48:54.440 --> 03:49:00.680]  and shoot four others connecticut 20 year old adam lanza fatally shoots 20 children in six school
[03:49:00.680 --> 03:49:07.800]  staff members in a massive gun free zone while fbi crime statistics clearly show the violent
[03:49:07.800 --> 03:49:14.360]  crime rate going down as the u.s population increases of course in real life violent criminals
[03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:18.920]  couldn't care less about laws do you think the drug cartels that overran mexico and left it a
[03:49:18.920 --> 03:49:23.240]  failed state gave a crap that the country has some of the strongest gun control laws in the western
[03:49:23.240 --> 03:49:30.040]  hemisphere no because they were too busy gunning down tourists in cancun who were left defenseless
[03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:36.600]  by gun control more than 70 000 people have been killed in drug related violence in mexico since
[03:49:36.600 --> 03:49:43.640]  2007 and the number has only skyrocketed since the mexico's only hope is from the armed militias
[03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:48.920]  who have defied the country's gun laws to defend their communities from the cartels the murders
[03:49:48.920 --> 03:49:55.880]  in chicago only slowed down after illinois enacted a concealed carry law we need to discuss who we
[03:49:55.880 --> 03:50:02.040]  are as a nation talk about the freedoms that we have the rights that we have and how those might

[03:54:41.160 --> 03:54:54.280]  look war pandemic economic turmoil natural disaster terror attack false flag or real in our modern
[03:54:54.280 --> 03:55:02.440]  times these are all very real reasons to prepare for times of crisis this list however is excluding
[03:55:02.440 --> 03:55:11.160]  the worst case scenario which is also the most likely to occur emp or an electromagnetic pulse
[03:55:11.160 --> 03:55:18.600]  whether such a disaster is caused by a terror attack or nature the results will be unimaginable
[03:55:18.600 --> 03:55:25.640]  no lights no appliances your cell phone will not work and your car isn't going to start
[03:55:25.640 --> 03:55:32.840]  worst yet the power will not be turned back on for at least an entire year the spread of the damage
[03:55:32.840 --> 03:55:40.520]  will cover almost the entire western continent that's no lights no heat no refrigeration and no
[03:55:40.520 --> 03:55:49.000]  plumbing society will ultimately break down a 2008 study predicts that in the case of such an event
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:56.920]  90 percent of americans will die after the first year you heard me right 90 percent how can you
[03:55:56.920 --> 03:56:03.560]  and your family survive such a disaster and what can you do to be one of the 10 percent that lives
[03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:15.480]  we asked survival experts joel scousen matthew stein and james wesley ralls to join us and briefly
[03:56:15.480 --> 03:56:22.840]  explain the most important things every american must know to stay alive during the most unthinkable
[03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:39.800]  of times so there you go ladies and gentlemen blackout usa that's going to premiere tonight on
[03:56:39.800 --> 03:56:44.760]  the informers nightly news i'm sure you also get a chance to see it this weekend on facebook youtube
[03:56:44.760 --> 03:56:50.360]  it'll be on informers.com as well and jacobson it was your idea to put this piece together and
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:54.040]  you know we only have a couple minutes but tell us what it's all about and why do you think it's
[03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:59.880]  so important that everyone should should see it yeah well darin thanks for having me in here right
[03:56:59.880 --> 03:57:07.000]  now um the reason why i thought it was so important to do a report about an emp attack or an emp
[03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:13.640]  event like a solar storm or something like that is when i learned how vulnerable our power grid
[03:57:13.640 --> 03:57:19.720]  actually is i mean to give it a quick metaphor it's sort of like our entire civilization is built
[03:57:19.720 --> 03:57:24.760]  on a house of cars we go back to the dark ages we will go right back to the dark ages with like
[03:57:24.760 --> 03:57:31.400]  the the slightest nick and all the government has to do metaphorically is let's say spray that permanent
[03:57:31.400 --> 03:57:38.440]  glue spray on it metaphorically or quote unquote harden the electrical grid by doing an upgrade
[03:57:38.440 --> 03:57:44.360]  by protecting it for this emp event which they're not doing or former vice president united states
[03:57:44.360 --> 03:57:50.360]  dig chaining he says it's a number one threat that our nation faces which uh makes you know both of
[03:57:50.360 --> 03:57:57.000]  us have discussed this and the government a is clearly aware of such a problem b are they even
[03:57:57.000 --> 03:58:02.280]  going to plan a false flag attack knowing the vulnerability of our situation i don't think
[03:58:02.280 --> 03:58:10.200]  anybody could really uh quantify in their own mind exactly the level of disaster if the if uh emp
[03:58:10.200 --> 03:58:15.320]  event actually takes place so it's very very important that we get ourselves prepared that we
[03:58:15.960 --> 03:58:22.680]  have our family prepared we talked to several survivalist experts and uh again folks that's
[03:58:22.680 --> 03:58:29.160]  blackout usa premier tonight and the info was nightly news we're out of time alex will return
