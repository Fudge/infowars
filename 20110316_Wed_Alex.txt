[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.480 --> 00:26.920]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones my friends we
[00:26.920 --> 00:34.640]  are live but thank you so much for joining us today it is Wednesday the 16th day of March
[00:34.640 --> 00:41.840]  2011 we're gonna be live here for at least the next three hours Greg Palast who's reported
[00:41.840 --> 00:47.680]  for BBC and ABC News really an expert on reporting on nuclear disasters and the fact that the
[00:47.680 --> 00:53.280]  Japanese are set to build the same designs of the reactors that have gone haywire in
[00:53.280 --> 00:59.040]  Japan here in the United States he'll be joining us coming up in the middle of the
[00:59.040 --> 01:03.400]  next hour Mike Adams the health ranger who happens to be in Austin right now will be
[01:03.400 --> 01:09.960]  joining us in studio to talk about his research into the health effects of radiation and ways
[01:09.960 --> 01:17.480]  to protect yourself I got up this morning and saw listeners commenting on info wars.com
[01:17.480 --> 01:26.000]  this headline out of KTVA CBS news in Alaska and the headline was state radiation levels
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.680]  in Alaska elevated but non-harmful and we posted the part of the article and then Watson
[01:32.680 --> 01:36.800]  called me he said have you read deeper and as you read deeper in here it sounds like
[01:36.800 --> 01:40.720]  they're hedging their bets kind of like the Japanese did on Friday and Saturday saying
[01:40.720 --> 01:44.440]  we don't know if they're elevated but they might be elevated and now we know we have
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.000]  radiation maps it's much worse than what they had said the Pentagon is reporting that hundreds
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.800]  of miles out 200 miles out ships have been exposed to radiation and we know the winds
[01:55.800 --> 02:00.560]  are coming towards the west coast the United States and Canada and Alaska is one of the
[02:00.560 --> 02:06.400]  first places they believe it may hit but it's not clear reading this and I think KTVA needs
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.400]  to change their headline or clarify because what what does this headline say state radiation
[02:11.400 --> 02:17.840]  levels in Alaska elevated but non-harmful and then you read deeper into the article
[02:17.840 --> 02:23.720]  and it says the state commissioner of health and social services says Alaska could see
[02:23.720 --> 02:27.800]  a very small increase in radiation levels well below what could be harmful and I remember
[02:27.800 --> 02:31.760]  reading this this morning and I swear it was different and said that they had said that
[02:31.760 --> 02:35.720]  so I don't know if they are elevated and the government called which has happened before
[02:35.720 --> 02:42.600]  in history and said cover this up spin this I don't know if that news out finishes wrong
[02:42.600 --> 02:47.320]  but we're working on it and updating our article right now our headline alert has radiation
[02:47.320 --> 02:52.200]  from stricken Japanese plant reached Alaska question mark and then we have the related
[02:52.200 --> 02:56.680]  article from last night that is the most important and I'm getting to that after the break alert
[02:56.680 --> 03:04.840]  Fukushima cover up 40 years of spent nuclear rods blown sky high the problem here is we
[03:04.840 --> 03:09.080]  don't know what the truth is we have this trillion dollar Navy trillion dollar Air Force
[03:09.080 --> 03:15.400]  trillion dollar plus Army ships all over the Pacific aircraft and they are out there
[03:15.400 --> 03:19.640]  getting radiation measurements and they're not telling us what's going on other than
[03:19.640 --> 03:26.680]  that ships 200 miles out to sea east of Japan US ships that cruise on board some of them
[03:26.680 --> 03:32.320]  were radiated those that were on deck I did get a serious dose of of radiation so we're
[03:32.320 --> 03:38.080]  watching this obviously things have continued to deteriorate there's only 50 people staying
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.840]  at Fukushima it's a giant six nuke plant with the mark one that blew up on Monday three
[03:43.840 --> 03:49.400]  others that are partially blown up with huge explosions headline the Fukushima reactor
[03:49.400 --> 03:56.440]  plants crisis is not claimed soon Japan will need more brave volunteers to battle it again
[03:56.440 --> 04:02.160]  the Fukushima nuclear plants crisis is not calmed soon Japan will need more brave volunteers
[04:02.160 --> 04:09.600]  to battle it I mean can you imagine 50 people and will blow up this map we've got put out
[04:09.600 --> 04:25.280]  with the Japanese radiation levels and you can see there the areas in red that have higher
[04:25.280 --> 04:33.040]  levels orange moderate yellow medium to low and then you've got the testing underway you
[04:33.040 --> 04:38.360]  know it's funny the worst hit areas this reportedly being put up with Japanese government the
[04:38.360 --> 04:47.640]  worst hit areas where Fukushima is based and south downwind are not reporting they're
[04:47.640 --> 04:53.600]  saying under survey so the areas where you can bet your bottom dollar the radiation is
[04:53.600 --> 05:02.480]  the highest they're saying basically they're not releasing the information hi folks this
[05:02.480 --> 05:06.760]  is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce
[05:06.760 --> 05:12.000]  pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.520]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[05:16.520 --> 05:21.920]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[05:21.920 --> 05:27.920]  system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver nano
[05:27.920 --> 05:33.000]  particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.560]  of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the
[05:38.560 --> 05:43.840]  silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making

[05:51.000 --> 06:02.440]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com hundreds of nations have
[06:02.440 --> 06:08.440]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[06:08.440 --> 06:12.880]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[06:12.880 --> 06:18.520]  at home I have tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are
[06:18.520 --> 06:24.840]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[06:24.840 --> 06:30.680]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[06:30.680 --> 06:35.800]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[06:35.800 --> 06:40.280]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who
[06:40.280 --> 06:44.680]  do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington
[06:44.680 --> 06:51.720]  dc we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on dvd

[06:59.640 --> 07:04.200]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[07:04.200 --> 07:09.400]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[07:09.400 --> 07:14.280]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[07:14.280 --> 07:19.880]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[07:19.880 --> 07:24.920]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[07:24.920 --> 07:30.040]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[07:30.040 --> 07:34.200]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[07:34.200 --> 07:38.920]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[07:38.920 --> 07:43.320]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[07:43.320 --> 07:49.080]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup
[07:49.080 --> 07:54.360]  dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my

[08:05.160 --> 08:25.240]  radio network we are live ladies and gentlemen we are now six days into the unfolding disaster
[08:25.240 --> 08:31.960]  centering in and around the north of tokyo at the fukushima reactor complex four of the six
[08:31.960 --> 08:40.760]  reactors have exploded or caught fire the big issue here that everyone needs to understand
[08:40.760 --> 08:49.560]  the most important report that we have out for everyone to read is alert fukushima cover up
[08:49.560 --> 08:57.480]  40 years of spent nuclear rods blown sky high it is confirmed and been hiding in plain view
[08:57.480 --> 09:02.360]  since saturday and then again on monday with the two biggest explosions at fukushima one
[09:03.160 --> 09:12.440]  and three that 40 years of spent uranium and plutonium fuel rods numbering over 600 000
[09:13.320 --> 09:19.880]  were stored inside the main containment facilities that have blown sky high you have the internal
[09:19.880 --> 09:27.080]  sealed with the live fuel rods and we'll click for folks watching on prism planet dot tv that
[09:27.080 --> 09:33.960]  related article again alert fukushima cover up 40 years of spent nuclear rods blown sky high
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.400]  that report was put out last night by paul watson and kurt nemo it has all the proof
[09:39.400 --> 09:46.200]  all the evidence this shows that it's much worse than they had first reported outside of the main
[09:46.200 --> 09:53.320]  six plants they had hundreds of thousands stored in pools because of their exposed to the atmosphere
[09:53.320 --> 10:01.080]  they catch fire hundreds of thousands of others were inside plant one two three four five and six
[10:01.720 --> 10:07.400]  four of those plants have exploded two of them were spectacularly plant one on saturday morning
[10:08.120 --> 10:13.400]  plant number three with the mark one mox plutonium based uranium as well a reactor
[10:13.400 --> 10:20.200]  those exploded you've got the main containment area another containment facility and then the
[10:20.200 --> 10:29.960]  inner sealed metal container with the live rods that are going through their reactions to produce
[10:29.960 --> 10:37.560]  heat to turn the steam based turbines so they have rods inside the third area in the core
[10:37.560 --> 10:44.200]  they're live then within another area outside that they have the spent rods and then in another
[10:44.200 --> 10:51.080]  area outside that they have more spent fuel rods and then the final roof box casing over the internal
[10:51.080 --> 10:56.120]  dome when you see the fukushima three and we'll try to play that video for folks that are watching
[10:56.120 --> 11:01.400]  radio listeners can just search the term fukushima number three explodes that huge mushroom cloud
[11:01.400 --> 11:07.320]  thousands of feet in the air ejecting all of what looks like fuel rods i said on monday we now know
[11:07.320 --> 11:16.600]  in that mark one reactor three it was filled with rods outside of the metal sealed internal casing
[11:17.240 --> 11:21.960]  spraying those all over the place then we have the press reports of fuel rods on fire all over
[11:21.960 --> 11:28.600]  the place fuel rods that are outside in cooling tanks on fire this is one of the biggest nuclear
[11:28.600 --> 11:38.920]  waste dumps in the world not just the six reactors and there you see the video of equipment what looks
[11:38.920 --> 11:46.040]  like fuel rods you name it spraying into the atmosphere now the japanese government's having
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.440]  to admit that radiation is much higher than they've said many people tried to evacuate 37 million
[11:50.440 --> 11:57.880]  metro tokyo a total of 8.5 million in the actual city limits 37 million people many of them trying
[11:57.880 --> 12:06.200]  to go south the country's had hundreds of aftershocks hit by massive tsunami hit by the 9.1 earthquake
[12:06.920 --> 12:14.680]  friday and the subsequent aftershocks thank god that the japanese are stoic and and and
[12:14.680 --> 12:23.400]  very lawful well-behaved people or this would be a lot worse right now and we have a map put out
[12:23.400 --> 12:29.240]  out by the japanese government we'll put that back on uh screen we have we have several maps
[12:29.240 --> 12:40.920]  where is this particular one from japan radiation uh monitoring by pro feature and they're taking
[12:40.920 --> 12:47.800]  the different readings being put out by a target map is integrating them we have other maps that
[12:47.800 --> 12:53.800]  show similar reports from mainstream media so we're taking this map is accurate but notice if
[12:53.800 --> 12:58.680]  you go to this map and we'll get it posted on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com very soon
[12:58.680 --> 13:02.680]  i've got my staff working around the clock on this we're going to post a page with a bunch of
[13:02.680 --> 13:08.840]  different maps drudge report dot com is linked to a lot of these maps as well that the fukushima area
[13:08.840 --> 13:14.680]  is in pink now there are areas south of it directly where the wind was blowing uh southeast
[13:14.680 --> 13:22.600]  that is in red showing higher levels of radiation other areas in orange also south exactly what you
[13:22.600 --> 13:31.320]  would expect uh but the pink or the dark pink almost purple says under survey which means
[13:31.320 --> 13:37.880]  they're not releasing the information to be added uh to the alert sites so i want to open the phones
[13:37.880 --> 13:44.040]  up and as listeners from japan and others direct us to them you can go to the different
[13:44.040 --> 13:49.640]  prefects or counties or states of japan and their local governments have their own radiation
[13:49.640 --> 13:54.200]  detection and they've been reporting uh higher levels than what the mainstream media has been
[13:54.200 --> 13:57.720]  reporting worldwide what governments have been saying and the reports they've been putting out
[13:57.720 --> 14:02.840]  for three days have turned out to be accurate over and over again so i want to open the phones up
[14:02.840 --> 14:08.760]  for people only in japan i know a lot of americans and others are having trouble getting out uh a lot
[14:08.760 --> 14:13.560]  of media outlets like french world service and others have pulled out the british the german
[14:13.560 --> 14:18.680]  the french are not flying flights into tokyo that's been going on now for a day and a half
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.680]  i want to open the phones up specifically for people that want to direct us to different
[14:23.400 --> 14:28.520]  in fact let's ourselves go to japanese monitoring sites some of the state governments or prefect
[14:28.520 --> 14:33.000]  governments to see what radiation levels they're showing to try to integrate it in with what our
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.200]  media is telling us because in the history of nuclear disasters one thing we know is that media
[14:38.200 --> 14:43.240]  will cover up and spend what's happening now depending on the different estimates by meteorologists
[14:43.240 --> 14:50.120]  who study the prevailing winds the trade winds and then up higher the jet stream from japan
[14:50.120 --> 14:56.120]  going right across the west coast of the us and then continuing across the continuous lower 48
[14:56.120 --> 15:06.360]  as well as canada to the north it generally takes four to seven days for pollution from japan
[15:06.360 --> 15:12.920]  to hit the united states the surgeon general last night put out conflicting messages
[15:13.720 --> 15:17.480]  the federal government had been putting out reports saying don't worry about potassium iodine
[15:17.480 --> 15:21.640]  there's not going to be a problem but then she came out and said you might as well try to get some
[15:21.640 --> 15:28.840]  as a precaution um but it is a no-brainer and dr bob bowman three degrees in nuclear physics
[15:28.840 --> 15:33.320]  and aeronautics agreed on this broadcast that some of that radiation and adelaide is going to get
[15:33.320 --> 15:37.880]  there and they're talking about well don't worry only a couple of the internal cores have been
[15:38.680 --> 15:43.640]  unsealed and we're hoping that there's not a problem but there's only 50 workers of the 500
[15:43.640 --> 15:49.960]  that should be there fukushima's 50 not afraid to die is the cbs news headline in there with all
[15:49.960 --> 15:58.520]  those explosions and problems and the place being a giant nuclear waste dump with 600 000
[15:58.520 --> 16:09.800]  plus 600 000 plus spent fuel rods that are highly radioactive undoubtedly on fire in the
[16:09.800 --> 16:16.520]  explosions being thrown all over the place uh it just makes the head spin separately this
[16:16.520 --> 16:22.520]  morning i saw a report out of k tv a we wrote a blurb on with the headline state radiation
[16:22.520 --> 16:28.840]  levels in alaska elevated but non-harmful but then when you actually watch the video of the state
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.560]  official he says they could get there and could be elevated but they'll be low and that and that
[16:33.560 --> 16:39.960]  they don't think it'll be a problem but the headline somebody got to them and and and
[16:39.960 --> 16:45.960]  adam water it down or or it's a mistake uh my gut tells me alaska would be many meteorologists
[16:45.960 --> 16:50.040]  say the first place because on friday the winds were going northeast mainly then they changed
[16:50.040 --> 16:56.040]  pretty much east then they shifted yesterday to southeast down over tokyo today they flip back
[16:56.040 --> 17:00.440]  out straight into the ocean towards the united states west coast so it's it's it's you know the
[17:00.440 --> 17:06.920]  wind is moving around but generally to the east but it moves from the north to the south it hasn't
[17:06.920 --> 17:13.480]  yet turned west uh towards the rest of japan and uh russia since this began friday and generally the
[17:13.480 --> 17:18.840]  winds do move that way from west to east over japan so we're trying to track this now now here's
[17:18.840 --> 17:26.600]  another big facet where is the trillion dollar navy the trillion dollar air force the trillion
[17:26.600 --> 17:33.400]  dollar uh army where are they with their radiation detectors where are they with aircraft flying through
[17:33.960 --> 17:38.600]  the atmosphere at different levels giving the public reports and estimates of how much
[17:38.600 --> 17:46.760]  radiation is coming our way and when it'll make landfall if any why five days friday saturday
[17:46.760 --> 17:56.600]  sunday monday tuesday five days it's now wednesday the 16th uh of march 2011 where are those reports
[17:57.560 --> 18:02.280]  i'm seeing reports one of the democratic underground the detectors newspapers have reported
[18:02.280 --> 18:08.040]  but then it's unconfirmed in southern california elevated levels we don't know the truth and as
[18:08.040 --> 18:15.960]  dr bob bowman said yesterday cesium strontium different isotopes of strontium radioactive
[18:15.960 --> 18:21.640]  iodine most detectors are not going to pick that up they're just going to pick up basic
[18:21.640 --> 18:27.880]  radiation not the lower level radiation that's in those different isotopes it's very dangerous toxic
[18:27.880 --> 18:33.560]  and poisonous that a lot of general detectors are not going to pick those up so that's a whole
[18:33.560 --> 18:37.320]  another issue i'm trying to just throw out different topics different points to get all
[18:37.320 --> 18:43.800]  of us thinking put our heads together are you in japan do you have family in japan um again our
[18:43.800 --> 18:48.200]  listeners are smart help us there's a whole bunch of different states prefixes are called in japan
[18:48.760 --> 18:53.880]  send us emails at show tips at info wars dot com uh i should have already been on this but there's
[18:53.880 --> 18:58.760]  so much is going on but we've seen the press reports of local districts of japan reporting
[18:58.760 --> 19:03.240]  higher radiation than what the main government's been saying and there's clearly a cover-up
[19:03.240 --> 19:09.480]  they've been being very deceptive about this we've we've had alert fukushima cover-up 40 years
[19:09.480 --> 19:18.200]  of spent nuclear rods blown sky high that is a fact that they that we know at one and three
[19:18.200 --> 19:24.200]  that blew up spectacularly with a lot of force particularly the mark one mox reactor fukushima
[19:24.200 --> 19:30.520]  three that blew sky high we know that stored on top of that facility and within that facility
[19:30.520 --> 19:36.520]  at different levels where hundreds of thousands of spent plutonium and uranium based fuel rods
[19:36.520 --> 19:41.000]  seven percent plutonium 93 percent uranium and that those sprayed up into the atmosphere

[36:35.640 --> 36:40.520]  clue to what is occurring inside the reactor buildings around which high-level radiation has
[36:40.520 --> 36:47.880]  been detected where is the military where is the multi trillion dollar military that cost
[36:47.880 --> 36:55.880]  around two trillion a year 1.1 trillion on budget 800 to 900 billion off budget where is the 1.9 to

[37:30.040 --> 37:37.400]  container area with the live rods is exposed well of course you saw those explosions and then the
[37:37.400 --> 37:43.560]  whole place is a giant nuclear waste dump with them storing the rods on top of the containment
[37:43.560 --> 37:51.400]  vessels that blew up i mean you better believe radiation is coming our way a prey most of it
[37:51.400 --> 37:55.080]  rains down in the ocean that's probably going to happen but still some of it is going to get here
[37:55.080 --> 38:00.840]  and the government is saying no big deal no threat no problem i'm so angry i can barely even broadcast
[38:00.840 --> 38:06.280]  right now i have children i looked at them this morning you know what radiation does to children
[38:06.280 --> 38:11.560]  it's many times worse for them because they got fast growing cells an estimated 70 percent of the

[38:33.080 --> 38:39.640]  county and other areas in northeast and eastern japan and they're not giving radiation levels
[38:39.640 --> 38:44.440]  of around Fukushima or south if you look at the graphs that are on tv and on the web that are
[38:44.440 --> 38:50.200]  being they're taking government numbers it shows moderate to high levels around tokyo but then
[38:50.200 --> 38:56.760]  they have it in pink around Fukushima and saying oh they're still gathering data what does that
[38:56.760 --> 39:02.680]  tell you ladies they do not want you to know but they are reporting the radiation levels abc news
[39:02.680 --> 39:08.680]  says are so high that quote workers cannot carry out even minimal work at the plant now chief
[39:08.680 --> 39:16.040]  cabinet secretary yuko indano told the associated press because of the radiation risk we are on
[39:16.040 --> 39:25.400]  standby risk i will continue to cover all of this as it unfolds at info wars dot com
[39:25.400 --> 39:29.400]  at prison planet dot com we have mike adams the health ranger in studio in the third hour
[39:30.920 --> 39:37.000]  we have uh investigative journalist greg palace who's uh for decades reported on nuclear mishaps
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.360]  in dangers to get his take joining us at the bottom of the next hour we have all of this
[39:42.360 --> 39:46.120]  information unfolding i'm going to take some phone calls and then i'm going to get to the most
[39:46.120 --> 39:52.520]  important article of all of these we know that there are three levels of containment the central
[39:52.520 --> 39:58.040]  sealed live reactors that do not have spent uranium and plutonium they have the real deal in them
[39:58.680 --> 40:04.200]  totally deadly as deadly as it gets then there's another area above that with the equipment the
[40:04.200 --> 40:09.560]  pipes and the water cooling that's what's been completely blown away at fukushima number three
[40:09.560 --> 40:15.160]  guaranteed and seriously damaged at one and two four is also damaged but three is the big one
[40:15.160 --> 40:21.000]  with a big mushroom cloud they're now admitting that from monday now two days ago blew up more
[40:21.000 --> 40:30.120]  than 48 hours ago here's what we know they store them at the second level of containment that was
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.600]  completely blown away and ejected into the air then it's based all around the base with the
[40:34.600 --> 40:41.480]  explosions those have caught on fire it is complete bedlam at that facility and the rods
[40:41.480 --> 40:45.800]  that are spent are highly radioactive they break down into basically what's described as like a
[40:45.800 --> 40:51.480]  type of graphite looking powder they then begin to burn they then get into the atmosphere they're
[40:51.480 --> 40:54.920]  on the ground they're getting into the japanese water table they're getting into the ocean right
[40:54.920 --> 40:59.720]  there they're on the coast but that's not the big issue the big issue is that with all these
[40:59.720 --> 41:05.800]  explosions they've been ejected into the air thousands of feet being caught up in the prevailing
[41:05.800 --> 41:11.080]  winds into the jet stream you better believe the federal government if you follow their past history
[41:11.080 --> 41:15.160]  the japanese government and others and the australians are freaking out australian abc news
[41:15.160 --> 41:19.080]  about the history of japanese cover-ups our own cover-ups it turned out pre-mile island
[41:19.080 --> 41:23.400]  was a hundred times worse than they first claimed if you follow what they've done in the past here's
[41:23.400 --> 41:29.000]  the here's the big issue here's the key if you follow that and you look at those explosions
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.160]  and you know there's fuel rods that were stacked on top those buildings not just inside but stacked
[41:33.160 --> 41:39.720]  on top the buildings in containers and water so they don't ignite spraying into the atmosphere
[41:39.720 --> 41:47.880]  they then catch on fire they're so radioactive still this is unbelievable and almost all of
[41:47.880 --> 41:53.080]  it's going out to sea for six or seven hours the wind turned to the south hit tokyo with a blast of
[41:53.080 --> 41:58.760]  this stuff then it turned back out to sea good for the japanese not good for the sea life
[41:58.760 --> 42:06.520]  not good for people in north america it's coming you can bet your bottom dollar on that and we
[42:06.520 --> 42:16.600]  have this bizarre headline out of k tv a state radiation levels in ak alaska elevated but not
[42:16.600 --> 42:22.360]  harmful i saw that and freaked out we posted the article then i read deeper it said oh no we were
[42:22.360 --> 42:27.400]  expecting it could come here but it won't be that elevated won't be a big deal so did they get to him
[42:27.400 --> 42:31.960]  um have the have the detectors gone off alaska is one of the first places to make landfall because
[42:31.960 --> 42:36.920]  on friday and saturday it was going northeast then it changed to the east then it changed the south
[42:36.920 --> 42:46.840]  then it changed back to the east so the first plumes of the cesium strontium radioactivide
[42:46.840 --> 42:52.440]  i did go to the northeast towards alaska generally it takes four to seven days for it to get there
[42:52.440 --> 43:01.080]  here friday saturday sunday monday tuesday that's four and a half days till last night in alaska i
[43:01.080 --> 43:07.880]  don't know i don't know i don't know but you can't trust government to tell you do you work in a
[43:07.880 --> 43:14.440]  nuclear plant do you work in a detection facility on the west coast have you been called by the feds
[43:14.440 --> 43:18.680]  and told not to tell people what your detectors are picking up we know this has happened before
[43:18.680 --> 43:23.560]  in previous disasters in the u.s if you can get through on the lines when you hear somebody hang up
[43:24.120 --> 43:29.480]  please try to get in or email us at show tips and info wars dot com with your number we will call

[44:05.800 --> 44:10.440]  article that needs to be gotten out to everyone it's still at the bottom of the front page of
[44:10.440 --> 44:15.400]  info wars dot com it'll roll off soon and be in the featured archive there's a little link down
[44:15.400 --> 44:21.560]  there or in the tiles at the top alert fukushima cover up 40 years of spent fuel rods blown sky
[44:21.560 --> 44:26.200]  high we've got all the evidence and the proof and in their own schematics and their own admissions
[44:26.200 --> 44:33.720]  it's a hundred percent people need to know the true severity of this it's almost incalculable
[44:33.720 --> 44:40.360]  right now uh let's go to cesar in west virginia national guard cesar what are you hearing what's
[44:40.360 --> 44:47.400]  your take hey buddy how you doing i'm all right uh well uh on the east coast we haven't heard anything
[44:47.400 --> 44:53.800]  but uh what i wanted to ask was have heard anything about the surf teams that were created
[44:53.800 --> 44:58.280]  to deal with this kind of situation no they have spent hundreds of billions of dollars
[44:58.280 --> 45:04.280]  conservatively in the last decade alone for nuclear chemical biological systems detection units
[45:04.280 --> 45:08.840]  why aren't they being airlifted there where are the surveillance aircraft where are the monitors
[45:08.840 --> 45:13.080]  you know they're flying around getting readings they're not telling us do you really believe the
[45:13.080 --> 45:17.880]  pentagon who's obsessed with knowing everything and spying on our email do you really think
[45:17.880 --> 45:22.840]  with their giant presence in the pacific five days into this that they're not crawling all over this
[45:22.840 --> 45:27.560]  with exact radiation measurements and they know exactly when that stuff's going to make landfall
[45:27.560 --> 45:35.080]  here in the u.s yeah i mean well california has has uh a tank itself i know hawai has one why don't
[45:35.080 --> 45:41.000]  hold on i'm gonna have you talk but i just i gotta get this out where are the spy satellites
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.160]  there's hundreds of them they gotta wait till tomorrow with a drone do you buy that for a
[45:45.160 --> 45:51.320]  minute cesar no not at all not at all they they could they could those things at any moment
[45:51.320 --> 45:55.960]  all you need is to die with the right keyboard and you know punching buttons and that's it
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.280]  but what is that point to what will we know they've got them at bases in japan and south korea
[46:00.280 --> 46:04.680]  they're right there that points to cover up because everybody's demanding they do this so
[46:04.680 --> 46:10.600]  they say we might do it tomorrow does that not spell out cover up it spells out something bad
[46:10.600 --> 46:17.160]  that's for sure i'm sorry go back to the teams they've got on the west coast yeah well uh you
[46:17.160 --> 46:22.680]  don't think they don't have them in korea 300 miles away from japan or less with the whole
[46:22.680 --> 46:29.720]  nuclear thing there well we got a bunch of uh nbc teams uh nbc all over uh spread out south korea
[46:29.720 --> 46:34.920]  so uh something's got to be happening you know i but i was wondering if you've heard anything
[46:34.920 --> 46:39.240]  i've been on the internet and i can't find out they're saying six days after they might fly an
[46:39.240 --> 46:44.920]  airplane over tomorrow no no no how could they fly an airplane over tomorrow they already have a
[46:45.560 --> 46:50.840]  navy fleet out there with all you know with everything that they they need everything's
[46:50.840 --> 46:56.360]  there japan uh you know we have a unit in japan we have marines we have army we have air force

[47:09.240 --> 47:13.960]  dyke's curtain ammo right now we need reports out going they've got nuclear chemical biological
[47:13.960 --> 47:20.760]  teams in south korea the us is crawling over japan especially in okinawa off the coast on that island
[47:20.760 --> 47:25.400]  there are ships everywhere there are aircraft they should have days ago been giving us radiation
[47:25.400 --> 47:32.280]  readings military meteorologists telling us you know where what strata of the of the of the atmosphere
[47:32.280 --> 47:39.560]  it's gotten into where they estimate it's coming but they're not five days into this friday saturday
[47:39.560 --> 47:46.680]  sunday monday tuesday wednesday all right i'm gonna go to eliot i'm gonna go to james i'm gonna go
[47:46.680 --> 47:51.640]  to willow rollin in a moment i want to bring up paul watson paul i know you're doing a report on obama
[47:52.680 --> 47:57.000]  doing nca picks for over an hour and a half this morning and talking about basketball and laughing
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.440]  as japanese go in and literally what abc news calls a suicide mission to try to fix this
[48:02.440 --> 48:08.680]  and obama's obsessing over march madness and uh college basketball evil and he's leaving the
[48:08.680 --> 48:13.560]  country reportedly to go down to south america on some trade mission i know that's coming out
[48:13.560 --> 48:18.520]  and important to show but the bigger than that and you can be the editor kurt can do it steve you
[48:18.520 --> 48:23.800]  whoever they got mbc teams all over south korea nuclear chemical biological they got teams all
[48:23.800 --> 48:28.840]  over japan especially in okinawa huge u.s force there with nuclear detectors they got the ships
[48:28.840 --> 48:33.880]  we got the multi trillion dollar military they are guaranteed getting measurements and don't want
[48:33.880 --> 48:38.840]  to tell us they should be telling us with meteorologists what's happening with weather reports
[48:38.840 --> 48:44.600]  about if it's going to make landfall or wind so people can make preparations but just like 9 11
[48:44.600 --> 48:48.920]  with the deadly asbestos dust and the rest of it they knew it was deadly and told folks the air
[48:48.920 --> 48:53.960]  was safe to breathe following three mile island they report it was over 100 times worse a decade
[48:53.960 --> 48:59.800]  after than what they told us the abc news article out of australia how they're saying that the the
[48:59.800 --> 49:05.720]  japanese always cover up we've got to point out that there's not a government response or the response
[49:05.720 --> 49:11.560]  is secret and that we it's our government we demand to know what's going on paul watson what's your
[49:11.560 --> 49:22.120]  take on that um well the epa is announced that it's deploying radiation monitors to the west coast
[49:23.720 --> 49:29.720]  but obviously as he said who even knows if you can trust what they say after 9 11 and the air is
[49:29.720 --> 49:38.440]  safe to breathe public lost all confidence in trusted officials so i mean with the rush by
[49:38.440 --> 49:43.880]  potassium iodide that just shows how much confidence how much trust that they've lost over the past
[49:43.880 --> 49:51.000]  decade well paul we know there's 600 000 plus fuel rods there that have been blown to kingdom
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.440]  com there's no doubt that it's blowing in our direction and there's no doubt that some of it
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.480]  will make it here hopefully we pray it goes into the ocean but then what happens to the alaskan salmon
[50:02.200 --> 50:07.400]  the salmon out of washington state the canadian salmon what happens to the milk i mean and and
[50:07.400 --> 50:11.960]  where's the government they've got all these assets there and and they should be flying through those
[50:11.960 --> 50:17.240]  clouds that's what we pay the military to do they should be getting us the information paul
[50:17.240 --> 50:26.440]  paul yeah but i mean isn't meeting with the chicago black hawks um ice hockey team more important
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.640]  isn't you know parting with lawmakers during a full bobcat game of more significance because
[50:33.640 --> 50:38.600]  that's what so that's what obama has been doing over the past when is your report on that scumbag
[50:38.600 --> 50:45.400]  coming out about 15 minutes time we're standing by washington we'll get that out to everybody
[50:45.400 --> 50:52.040]  and try to force a response this should be a major scandal that that new world order puppet
[50:52.600 --> 50:56.120]  is he doing that on purpose to act like everything's okay it makes me sick thank you
[50:56.120 --> 51:01.640]  watson we need to get on the report dealing with the military not responding hi this is alex jones
[51:01.640 --> 51:06.200]  did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near
[51:06.200 --> 51:10.920]  the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[51:10.920 --> 51:15.000]  than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.880]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[51:19.880 --> 51:25.640]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it
[51:25.640 --> 51:30.840]  can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best
[51:30.840 --> 51:35.720]  part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[51:35.720 --> 51:41.960]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival
[51:41.960 --> 51:54.440]  seed bank dot com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis

[52:01.160 --> 52:07.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[52:07.320 --> 52:12.440]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[52:12.440 --> 52:18.600]  americans at home i've turned a memories influence on our president in congress and they really are
[52:18.600 --> 52:24.920]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention

[54:14.360 --> 54:29.640]  all right here's the deal coming up at eight after next hour i'm calling the white house
[54:30.200 --> 54:37.240]  i'm calling the head of the house john bainer up and i'm saying bainer you need to go on the
[54:37.240 --> 54:45.560]  house floor and rebuke rebuke obama right now for obsessing over ncaa uh basketball and meeting
[54:45.560 --> 54:51.240]  with hockey players he just all he's doing and getting up there in pr stunts to make sports fans
[54:51.240 --> 54:57.720]  like him doing hour and a half long picks this morning with a big board on tv while japan's emperor
[54:57.720 --> 55:03.640]  says don't give up hope we're in an emergency reactor is blowing up radiation raining up into
[55:03.640 --> 55:10.280]  the sky drifting towards the united states this scumbag government remember katrina they didn't
[55:10.280 --> 55:15.320]  come with food and water they ordered the troops to take guns from the high and dry areas government
[55:15.320 --> 55:20.840]  makes me sick they never protect you they never warn you they never use the assets to help people
[55:21.720 --> 55:26.360]  we need to know when the radiation hits the us instead of it being covered up so people
[55:26.360 --> 55:31.640]  could stay indoors as the cloud comes over there's a lot you can do to mitigate this instead
[55:31.640 --> 55:38.520]  march madness this is everything that's wrong with our society and i've got a rant coming up on
[55:38.520 --> 55:42.920]  that point at the 20 after next hour i'm gonna focus in on this and really nail them on it

[56:06.760 --> 56:13.320]  elliot in california you're on the air worldwide uh yes good morning uh i had a little epiphany
[56:13.320 --> 56:18.920]  yesterday a hiding in plain sight incident after listening to your show i went to a whole foods
[56:18.920 --> 56:27.000]  to buy some iodine and chlorophyll in it the salesperson i met there told me his best friend
[56:27.000 --> 56:33.240]  was a marine station in okinawa was on the support ship next to the aircraft carrier flying off the
[56:33.240 --> 56:39.240]  coast now the importance is when this happened and what happened is they were going to send troops
[56:39.240 --> 56:45.000]  into sendai to help with the recovery but they didn't the reason they didn't is because the
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.320]  radiation meters went off the charts an aircraft carrier is a deep water vessel it's way off the
[56:51.320 --> 56:58.040]  coast so it's 200 miles they admit some ships were radiated but they said low level okay that's
[56:58.040 --> 57:03.000]  not i asked this guy twice about it and i said did he say this on the phone he said no it was
[57:03.000 --> 57:10.360]  email he said it went off the charts that's a quote so this is well you notice when the carrier
[57:10.360 --> 57:15.880]  ran it didn't it didn't run when when one blew up because that was big but not that big on on saturday
[57:15.880 --> 57:23.240]  morning it ran when fukushima three the plutonium reactor went into that black mushroom cloud they
[57:23.240 --> 57:29.720]  raced out of there what i'm saying is it's hiding in plain sight if the military if our military
[57:29.720 --> 57:35.160]  won't go in there and help the civilians and and we get a report out on the ships out in the deep
[57:35.160 --> 57:40.360]  sea that the radiation meter went off the chart that supports what happens because when did this
[57:40.360 --> 57:46.440]  happen we were going to send in troops days ago so so the military they got submarines that can
[57:46.440 --> 57:51.080]  pop up and find out what the radiation is they got airplanes flying over needs the there you know
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.720]  china and korea and all the other governments are doing it too everybody knows what's going on
[57:55.720 --> 58:01.320]  i think they don't want to admit that is completely out of control just like overcooking in your oven
[58:01.320 --> 58:06.840]  when you blow something up it just i think that reactor is just wide open over there it's like
[58:06.840 --> 58:10.920]  when you burn a roast you forget it's there and you go to the store and you come back and it's on
[58:10.920 --> 58:16.840]  fire and the house is full of stinking smoke but this isn't roast fire this is uranium plutonium
[58:16.840 --> 58:20.920]  fire and they don't know what to do about it and they're not going to tell because they don't want
[58:20.920 --> 58:26.600]  to get on tv and say we don't know what to do well obama the criminal in chief is going to be held
[58:26.600 --> 58:31.240]  accountable that he's telling everybody play basketball suck your thumb and you just said it
[58:31.240 --> 58:35.640]  hidden in plain view the carriers have raced away they're not releasing radiation data they're not
[58:35.640 --> 58:47.080]  releasing it from around fukushima because it's bad folks thank you for listening to gcm visit gcm

[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:35.320]  friday the cover-up is now blowing sky high vukashima is a giant nuclear waste dump for
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:40.920]  spent fuel rods that were stored on top of the reactor containment systems that have blown sky
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:47.160]  high the internal cores that at least two have been opened up with the live uranium plutonium
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.640]  not just the spent rods the u.s. navy has pulled out hundreds of miles away they know full well
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.680]  how bad it really is the japanese government is saying it's almost too dangerous that it's a suicide
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:04.200]  mission for workers to even be inside fukashima that lets you know that this is a Chernobyl
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:09.480]  type situation and who's down when from it the west coast the united states the west coast of
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:17.240]  canada alaska and obama is running around at sports event after sports event covering this the printed

[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:50.920]  we need one of those guys to do a report pointing out what the last caller said and that this is
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.560]  hidden in plain view the aircraft carriers have raced away these incredibly radioactive facilities
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:01.400]  with rods blowing out in every direction cores exposed containment seals broken more fires more
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:10.760]  explosions more smoke more steam total catastrophe and our government saying no problem no problem
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:16.680]  we're directly downwind here's japan here's the west coast here's the jet stream it's going right
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:23.560]  over japan towards us i live here i got a stake in this it's headed towards texas as well it goes
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.160]  all over the place the winds are changing but they're but it mainly goes to the west so it's
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:32.840]  just goes to the northwest excuse me northeast southeast straight east the winds are just blowing
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:40.200]  from friday they were going northeast then they were going straight east then they were going
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:45.160]  southeast then they were going due south now they're going straight east those are the weather
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:51.480]  reports so it's just you know let's say i'm japan sitting here looking out towards the pacific ocean
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:58.360]  on the other side the united states and canada and the radiation is just being blown in all directions
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.840]  east towards the entire west coast of north america
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:14.120]  and then it will circle the globe and come right back to japan for two years it was
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:21.880]  measurable the uranium from chernobyl in 1986 and that was nothing that was one reactor reactor four
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:28.120]  blowing up and having a fire and steaming for 10 days into the atmosphere and it was just totally
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:33.400]  devastating they estimated the atomic energy agency a million people have died uh in the
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.000]  20 plus years since that happened the 25 years
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.600]  and obama is playing basketball and talking about basketball and meeting with hockey players right
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:54.600]  now and there is military crawling all over all over okinawa we got a giant base massive bases
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:02.760]  in south korea 300 miles away submarines jets spy planes satellites remember the u.s military
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.920]  was going to help friday and saturday and suddenly that after fukushima one blew up they said and we're
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:11.640]  not going to help we're sitting off coast monitoring then when fukushima three blew up monday morning
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.960]  they raced out of those waters they know they've got all the readings they know exactly what's
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:19.880]  coming our way they got meteorologists they've got computer models they've got a good idea where that
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:26.040]  radiation is going do they come out and tell us no problem no danger no they say oh some might come
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:43.400]  but it won't be that much boulder dash baloney bull garbage fraud nuts not going along with it
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:51.880]  this is a real world not basketball not britney spears not all the charlie sheen stuff this is

[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:40.760]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.840]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:11.400]  legislative needs to respond properly to this and stop covering it up fukushima is one of the
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.800]  biggest nuclear waste dumps in the world they store the rods on top of the containment facilities
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.680]  that have blown sky high at four of the eight of the six reactors that has all been ejected into

[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:32.760]  there is a mass exodus out of the 37 million metro tokyo into the south the winds thank god for
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:37.800]  the japanese change from the south to the east but that's going directly towards the u.s.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:45.080]  obama is running around on a sports marathon by design to act like nothing's wrong the u.s.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.320]  military is all over the place there and knows that things are far worse when you have plants
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:54.840]  blowing sky high that store rods on top of them being ejected 3 000 feet in the air you've got
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.360]  the japanese government saying they can't even put workers in there in emergency because it's
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.000]  going to kill them and that they may even pull out the 50 they've got in there that's abc news
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.200]  and our media saying no problem the government saying no problem nothing's coming here nothing's
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:13.800]  coming here when the winds come directly here this is hardcore serious the epa is finally
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:19.000]  announcing they're sending radiation units out to the west coast they're already there the militaries
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.640]  in japan they're in south korea they're there the submarines the ships and all they've done is
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:31.240]  put the carrier 200 miles away and u.s. forces on the island of japan said to keep 50 miles away
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:36.920]  from japan nuke plant we're going to continue to cover all of this right now james and texas former
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:43.400]  nuke worker you're on the air what do you have to tell us uh first of all uh i just want to say
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.040]  that was an awesome call that you gave to uh mr. bainer there i think we should all leave calls
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:53.560]  like that to the nuclear regulatory commission the nrc for not informing us on what's going on
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:59.560]  uh i'm a first-time caller i've been listening to you for about five years now and uh i never
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:04.840]  really wanted to call into the show but i felt like i had to say something i'm living in houston
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:12.760]  texas right now i was a reactor operator in the navy i used to shim rods and i was qualified on
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:21.320]  s5w plant s8g plant and i also worked at turkey point the same plant that the gentleman yesterday
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:29.240]  called about and uh i also want to say too that that your coverage over of this nuclear incident
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:34.280]  makes the mainstream media look like a joke and a bunch of clowns because they certainly don't know
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:39.880]  what they're talking about and they're not informing the public on what's going on uh i also would like
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:47.240]  to say too that based on my previous experience that i think there's something going on in fukushima
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:53.960]  it's just my opinion and i could be wrong but i think it might be an inside job because nuclear
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:27:00.680]  power plants are designed with so much redundancy and if they don't have any power to keep the core
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:06.600]  cool but they have enough power to run seawater uh i don't understand why they can't divert power to
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.840]  their bore rated water and keep steam flowing inside the steam generators something's not right
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:19.720]  they're not telling us something and i i think uh i'm calling shenanigans again i could be wrong
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:26.920]  but i think something needs to be said about it and i also am sick and tired of the government not
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:33.320]  informing the public on what nuclear power is people think that nuclear reactors are something
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:38.920]  that blows up because they're so obsessed with football they don't understand basic science
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:47.480]  all their all they're taught is to just be scared and not know about the facts and uh i'd like to
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:53.000]  tell people about basic information about the nuclear field so people can better uh prepare
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.800]  themselves and so they understand what's going on if i could sure briefly as we're going to break
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.280]  i mean the issue here is the government should be warning people and telling them
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:07.400]  basic safety facts but we have the headline at prison planet dot com now obama fiddles while
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:13.000]  fukushima burns devastating article we need to get out to everybody folks uh but go ahead james
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.160]  i'd give us a few tips okay well first of all we need to understand what radiation is first of all
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:26.600]  radiation is subatomic particles like electrons and neutrons that are traveling at high velocities
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:30.440]  and high speeds now because they're such tiny particles they don't do anything but if you have
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:35.720]  about a trillion of them they will damage your cells and they will start oozing out the insides
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:41.160]  of your cells and they'll also damage your dna so it's like a death by a thousand paper cuts
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:45.880]  you may have heard that term uh that's what radiation is now there's four types of radiation
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:51.080]  in nuclear power plants we talk about one is alpha which it gets on your skin it's no problem but if
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:59.400]  it gets inside your body uh then it'll cost problem that's like du uh i i believe so uh yeah that's
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:05.880]  could very well be please continue okay second is beta which is a high particle electron which can
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:11.960]  be stopped by clothes uh the third which they're not talking about is neutron people need to understand
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:19.480]  about neutron radiation uh a good way to protect yourself is water water helps to moderate uh
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:26.040]  electrons it helps slow them down also if you can get some type of bore water that will help to
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:31.880]  and the fourth is gamma which you need lead shielding for and uh i hear the music in the
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:35.400]  background so well i'll tell you what stay there to finish up we gotta go to greg palis then we'll
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:41.400]  go back to you james then will richard rob ron i'll get to all of you and more the health ranger
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.320]  also joining us in studio coming up in the next hour undoubtedly we'll be going into overdrive
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:52.040]  today we did almost six hours yesterday so much more coming up stay with us we're on the march

[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:31.720]  all right we are back live ladies and gentlemen rig palest is our guest bbc reporter guarding
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:37.320]  in newspaper writer he's written a lot of articles and done a lot of reports over the years about
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:41.400]  the nuclear power industry and governments covering things up three mile island we know
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:46.520]  was many times worse decades later we learned than what they told us tokyo electric to build us
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:53.160]  nuclear plants and he's got the no baloney info on japan's disasters nuclear operations at greg
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:34:00.440]  palace dot com we have continual coverage obviously at info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv we
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:05.240]  also stream live a video for prison planet dot tv members if you're a new listener and want to
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:11.560]  check out prison planet dot tv after greg leaves us i'm going to recap all the latest huge developments
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:17.080]  as things deteriorate quickly at fukushima but greg i wanted to bring this up to you
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:23.720]  and this is all hiding in plain view ap roiders mpr turns out fukushima as you know is a giant
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:30.440]  nuclear waste dump not just six nuke plants the mark one reactor number three blue sky high it had
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:36.200]  rods stored on top the building more than 200 000 it's reported that were ejected thousands of feet
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:41.560]  into the air highly radioactive they now admit two of the internal containment facilities at the plants
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:47.000]  have been breached now they're now saying in abc news the radiation is so bad but the japanese
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.080]  government is giving radiation maps but around fukushima it's in pink saying still collating data
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.920]  that will put that on screen they're still saying that they're still gauging so they're not giving us
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:03.640]  the numbers we have huge military presence in south korea in okinawa in japan they've been ordered
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:09.160]  not to get anywhere close to it the fleet has run away undoubtedly the winds are coming towards the
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:15.320]  united states and obama is running around spending an hour and a half picking ncaa numbers visiting
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:21.400]  with hockey teams and we have a report at prison planet dot com obama fiddles while fukushima burns
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:28.680]  it has a similar headline obama plays while japan begs for help on info wars dot com what is your
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:34.920]  take on the information i just covered well it's sick and sad yes they they're using they've used
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:41.160]  the fukushima plant as as you say a nuclear waste dump they've put the used rods these are very old
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:46.680]  plants they've been operating for three decades already they put all these old rods in the containment
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:52.920]  buildings so when these things have been blowing and going um basically you not only have the the
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:58.920]  reactors uh with with the live fuel but you have the old fuel now you have to understand the old
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:05.880]  fuel blows up too it it it can it causes massive contamination as soon as the water around those
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:11.080]  rods evaporate this is one of the problems by the way you know as you know obama said he would never
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:16.200]  have a push a nuclear program in the u.s unless there were a place to put these fuel rods other
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:22.280]  than next to a hot reactor he's never come up with it yet he has a proposal to spend 56 billion
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:29.640]  dollars or give 56 billion dollars in guarantees for nuclear plant building by the way that the
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:33.880]  that by the way that money is going to city bank and jp morgan when we talk about guarantees
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:37.960]  it doesn't go to the nuclear industry goes to the banks that are making the money on the new
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:44.280]  and then they hand it out let me go back for a moment um fukushima six plants total devastation
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:49.560]  there uh and the media is acting like that this is really no big deal and telling us no
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:54.840]  danger of fallout from your decades of researching this what's your gut view i mean it looks to me
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:00.280]  like a huge cover-up is going on i don't have a gut view have an expert view uh because before i was
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.520]  a journalist alex you may not know this i was actually an investigator for the government
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:10.680]  mainly uh nuclear racketeering and fraud uh i conducted some major multi-billion dollar
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:14.600]  investigations no i did know that so give us your expert take that and so and so the expert
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:21.240]  take is i've i've gone through evacuation plans morbidity rates um the uh geomorphology and weather
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:27.560]  of this we're going to have massive massive increase in leukemias thyroid cancers bone
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:36.120]  cancers lymphomas etc in japan but the prevailing wind goes across uh around the pacific rim uh
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:42.040]  into anchorage and uh doubtless vancouver in seattle are going to have um increases in cancer
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:47.160]  rates birth defects etc and i won't be anywhere near as big as japan i don't want to create panic
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:53.880]  or or upset but um it will be a slight rise if it's your kid that's deformed uh slight may not
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:59.400]  be a lot of comfort to you this is massive i would say you know i i don't want to be irresponsible
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.920]  put too many numbers on it but i think that people should have some idea that when we when we measure
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:07.720]  these things we don't measure in hundreds you measure in tens of thousands uh maybe a hundred
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:12.840]  thousand uh two hundred thousand in terms of morbidity mortality uh it's it's a very serious
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:19.320]  business the idea that it's not as bad as chernobyl is completely nuts propaganda you have to know
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.160]  that the japanese government has not put the radiation figures out because they claim that
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:30.680]  their aerial gauges above the fukushima uh uh plant are not operating what that means that
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.880]  they don't want to tell us if they're not operating and they're really insane uh that's right two
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:40.680]  giant districts we have a map up everywhere else in the country they have the readings in their public
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:49.000]  but in the two uh states uh or or pre-prefectories as they call them prefectures yeah the prefectures
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:54.920]  they say under survey so it shows tokyo in other areas with high levels of radiation but they
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:02.120]  won't give us the numbers uh in and around fukushima of course not uh they don't want to um and and
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:06.040]  you know uh i'm not a conspiracy not on there's not a kind of a conspiracy expert that's what i
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:11.240]  used to do for the government is uncover conspiracies and uh obviously they don't want this information
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:17.160]  out because it's also going to be massive lawsuits worldwide um you know tokyo electric
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:23.480]  by the way and this is uh on at gregpalas.com you'll see my article i was already investigating
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:30.440]  these guys before the explosion because bad news in texas buddy uh tokyo electric was invited by
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:38.680]  the obama administration to build two nuclear plants on the gulf coast of texas um originally the
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:45.560]  main owner and remains houston power now houston power for those texans that will know this was
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:50.760]  fined a billion dollars for incompetence in building the south texas the two south texas plants that
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:56.360]  are there they were paid uh several million criminal fines for covering up safety violations
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:03.240]  and they went bankrupt uh so you have a bankrupt company with a criminal record and um certified
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:09.320]  incompetent how come we're giving them a loan guarantee to build two more plants so their answer
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:15.880]  was well if you give us the guarantee we'll have wonderful tokyo electric come in they'll own 20
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:22.520]  percent and they will show us how to build a plant safely they will show us how to operate a plant
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:28.600]  safely well i i guess you can go and now see their training video right now um you just turn on
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.840]  any station it's on fire that's what they're bringing into texas and and tokyo electric will be
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:43.720]  tapping into our four billion dollar uh taxpayer guarantee uh and yet the department of energy
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:51.000]  the nuclear regulatory commission and congress both parties both parties uh are saying that they
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.800]  will not change this program of bringing tokyo electric into the united states and giving them
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:03.160]  big money big government subsidies to run our nuclear plants real serious stuff these guys have
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:10.600]  a long history of fraud there are three top executives had a resigned in uh 2002 over massive
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:17.720]  cover-up of safety violations i was about to say abc news australia reports on the long history of
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:23.400]  japanese cover-ups particularly tokyo electric and you at greg palace dot com we we do see the
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.480]  articles that in reports you can put out before this happened talking about this texas deal let me
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:31.400]  ask you another question before we continue with other areas you think are important for folks to
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:38.280]  know um looking at this japan builds these on fault lines on the sea where they have tsunamis
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:46.840]  and now they're talking about coming here to texas where we have uh hurricanes and tokyo electric
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:52.440]  are such smart guys they store the fuel rods on top the buildings that have now blown sky high
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:58.040]  talk about risk management i mean it seems like they did the worst things they possibly could have
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:04.440]  done well keep in mind i've heard that the chairman the former chairman of our nuclear
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:11.400]  regulatory commission and some japanese officials and nuclear officials say well this is surprising
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:18.600]  because you had both an earthquake and a tsunami together well my son who just had eighth grade
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:23.960]  science before this happened i could tell you that 100 of the time when you have a pacific
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:29.720]  grim offshore earthquake 100 of the time you get a tsunami of one size or another the idea
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:34.440]  that somehow these events occurred together is shocking it's like saying the back wheels of a car
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:39.960]  happened to move forward when the when the front wheels went forward they go together um you know
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.880]  and that they didn't know this that they think this seemed to think that this is an excuse that
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:50.600]  these two events happen together uh is really quite frightening and the fact that our own
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:54.840]  nuclear regulatory commission thinks that that's okay too especially when we're talking about the
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:43:02.120]  gulf coast of texas and other places there's going to be several plants plus we've got the you know
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:08.360]  i heard a nuclear uh expert from the industry so-called expert on tv saying well these are the
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:15.240]  these are 40 year old designs it's the old mark one plant well we have over 20 mark one plants
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:21.720]  running in the eyes 23 yeah weak containments you know this isn't about being pro or anti nuclear
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:27.400]  alex this is about being anti-fraud this is about being uh anti-shaked out we're getting con for
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:33.960]  four billion dollars in texas 56 billion dollars the obama administration wants to spend and um
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:38.120]  you know and and the cover the wonderful cover is don't worry we're bringing in tokyo electric
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:44.040]  they know how to do it well let me stop you we now have a whole bunch of former g and current g
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:49.400]  scientists quitting saying that they internally have complained about the mark ones and even
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:53.720]  some of the new uh designs so that's certainly bolsters and yes greg i've read your books and
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:59.560]  you know your bio i know that you were a anti nuclear fraud investigator uh for the for the
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:03.160]  federal government before you were an investigative journalist that's why you got into it now now
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:08.360]  let me stop you there let's pull back studying how governments and corporations cover up they
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:13.560]  and they follow a playbook studying the prevailing winds uh reactor rods being ejected thousands of
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:17.720]  feet in the air that were on top of fukushima three they blew up monday morning uh the fact
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:23.320]  that it's ongoing the levels of radiation we're talking about two of the uh you know containment
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:28.760]  facilities of the live reactors now breached uh the admissions that they don't even want to send
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:33.960]  an emergency workers now that it's quote a suicide mission the fukushima 50 uh the fact that they
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.600]  won't release the radiation numbers the fact that the pentagon is off swarming over the area and
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:45.320]  says they might send a spy plane tomorrow maybe no meteorologists no talk about fallout
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:51.560]  how do you expect the cover up now to unfold and what should folks on the west coast be doing
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.480]  well folks on the west coast should be actually sushi is a very good response because it has
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:02.520]  seaweed which has iodine you want to dose your body with as much natural iodine as possible
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:08.040]  so that you're to keep the iodine 16 out of your out of your thyroid there's no such thing as a
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:12.920]  natural um radiation shield but that that'd be the first thing i do is start eating some
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:19.800]  mussy weed uh the uh that's not a joke by the way uh i did recommend to japanese colleagues
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:25.480]  that they tweet out send out a message to evacuate at least uh 40 kilometers from the plant area
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:29.880]  the government told them first 10 kilometers which is only six miles and they changed it to 20
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:33.800]  and now that it's too late people actually be going through radiation they've told people to
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:40.280]  seal up their houses it's snowing don't turn on your heat seal up your houses um and just stay there
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:46.360]  um it's insanely irresponsible so you know they're lying because they didn't get out they didn't
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:50.760]  care if people stayed in the in the radiation zone they didn't hand out iodine pills because
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.840]  they didn't want a so-called panic people people will now die because they didn't hand out iodine
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:46:01.800]  pills um so these companies really literally don't care if you live and if you die but what about
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:06.760]  the pentagon swarming that area heavy military presence they've got detectors they're not giving
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:12.360]  us any numbers they're teaming up with the japanese and the cover-up well don't forget that that who
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.360]  is one of the biggest nuclear plant operators in the world it's the u.s. military we have you
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:20.600]  know weapons grade systems we have the disaster at the hand for nuclear plant which is like a you
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:26.920]  know a massive toxic zone uh low salamos the last thing we want to do is start questioning
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:31.640]  nuclear power because then you might start uh you know questioning the entire nuclear cycle and say
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:37.080]  you know who are nuclear bombs threatening you know an enemy or they threatening us because of
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:42.600]  the process we use here in the country how do we respond to this cover-up how do we respond i think
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:47.400]  that we have to i i guess that your your program uh we have to get the word out i mean it's very
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:51.720]  difficult you know i have years and years of experience in this field and yet i haven't been
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:57.480]  invited onto a single old american tv show i work for the the biggest network in the world bbc
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:02.120]  and i can be on i'm on television all over the planet but not here and it's not because i'm
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:07.320]  wonderful but it wears the experts who aren't on the payroll of the nuclear industry i haven't
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:14.520]  heard one one single um commentator or questioners say when these guys say don't worry about this
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:18.040]  weren't the other guys that said don't worry about this three weeks ago the guys that told us
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:22.440]  hey don't worry about nuclear power look they do it in japan without a problem i actually heard one
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:28.600]  nuclear expert from the industry yesterday say well we've had a pretty good record pretty good
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:33.720]  record you know there's going to be maybe a hundred thousand deaths here easy i mean what if
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:39.400]  500 Boeing airplanes fell out of the sky they said well you know it's been pretty we've had a good
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:46.120]  run would we accept that we accept that from this industry this is crazy and it only happens because
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:52.680]  it's an industry which lives and thrives on lies and fraud and i'm not saying it being the thing is
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.200]  that it's all your money is a rate payer you're a captive monopolized customers great let's not
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:04.040]  forget that that we that the epa knew the asbestos and mercury and lead they knew it was deadly and
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:08.200]  they said don't worry about gas masks the air is safe to breathe open the schools back up
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:14.840]  the day after 9 11 i mean they have a history of just lying to us with extreme pleasure yeah i don't
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:19.400]  know if they get pleasure out of it but they make a profit out of it which is extreme profit uh the
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:24.920]  last thing that what's the profit worth if their kids are radiated you know that i've always wondered
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:28.840]  about that but they apparently these guys don't care if their grandmothers are radiated they just
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:32.920]  couldn't as far as i could tell first of all they could care less the second is that most these guys
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:37.560]  are are off somewhere the guy at tokyo the the chairman tokyo electric he ain't in that plant
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:41.960]  he's got 50 guys who are basically held hostage in a radio they're not going to have full lives
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:46.760]  they're not going to have normal children uh you know they basically that that was a kamikaze
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:53.000]  mission uh it's it's frightening and it's terrible then they're coming to um like in texas i can
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.880]  tell you i know that they're lying already because i've already caught them uh they i don't know about
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:02.520]  the safety issues but they said that the plants at south texas would cost five billion dollars
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:08.920]  the japanese knew have in their pocket when they told the u.s government five billion dollars that
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:12.680]  it was going to be 12 billion dollars that's a heck of a difference let me go back here they're
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:17.640]  going to put a headline on screen the fukushima 50 are saying quote they're not afraid to die
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:22.200]  how about the ceo's and people have to get a shovel in there and go scoop up fuel rods that
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:27.000]  are all over the ground how about all these guys that love nuclear power how about they go in there
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.160]  and and show us how great nuclear power is instead of sending in they're now ordering police and the
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:39.480]  police are following orders the police are going in so they're they're sending the police in to do
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:46.120]  this well what's very sad is that i can tell you that when i did the studies of evacuation america
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:50.840]  if the u.s government ever said those are then 10 miles should leave which is our our official
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:54.920]  evacuation zone which has nothing to do with with wind which doesn't know about a 10 mile border
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:01.720]  that that most people within 30 miles will leave the japanese if they're told 10 miles 20 miles
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:06.680]  that's it they don't move uh it's and by the way that is a very frightening thing in terms of
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:12.520]  their building a plant i was talking to uh a uh a fire suppression engineer who works on the fire
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:16.920]  suppression at many many nuclear plants the u.s he says a really frightening to have the japanese
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:23.240]  come in and build because they have no culture of whistleblowing if if i uh if one of the bosses
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:27.800]  said well don't worry about that crankshaft don't worry about that that pump isn't good enough in
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.440]  case of an accident they will just say yes they're salarymen no one ever says that they're perfect

[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:44.760]  and barack obama the the the evidence of the outrageous arrogance and his disconnection from
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:51.480]  reality and trying to distract the american people from real issues is at whitehouse dot
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:55:00.440]  gov and we'll put this on screen president obama's 2011 ncaa brackets he spent over an hour doing
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:06.520]  this he's visiting with with hockey teams after that and he says one of the things i wanted to do
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:11.800]  on the show was as people are filling out their brackets this is obviously a national pastime
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:18.280]  we all have a great time it's a great diversion but i know a lot of people are thinking how they
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:24.520]  can help the japanese people during this time of need if you go to usa.gov which they always end
[01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:29.480]  up stealing that will list the nonprofits the charities that are out there helping it would
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:35.080]  be wonderful for people to do maybe offer a little help a little help to the japanese people at this
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:41.320]  time as they're filling out their brackets it's not going to take a lot of time that could be very
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:48.520]  helpful ladies and gentlemen talk about extreme arrogance he should have canceled doing it he
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.920]  shouldn't be doing that during the depression during the dollar plunging during the middle east
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:59.560]  exploding during the biggest nuclear disaster in world history with radiation coming this way and on
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:04.840]  top of it the pentagon has announced that they might fly a spy plane over with infrared tomorrow
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:10.280]  six days after the disaster five days in they've pulled the troops back they're not helping the
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:16.120]  radiations off the chart the japanese admit at the site it's a suicide mission for the people inside
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:22.200]  the plants are continuing to burn and explode sending the radiation towards us and we have this key
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:32.120]  article up on info wars dot com by paul watson obama plays while japan begs for help he's playing
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:41.240]  golf he's doing in say a a march madness picks he's meeting with hockey teams as the world descends
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:47.800]  into bedlam the headline at prison planet dot com is obama fiddles while fukushima burns america
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:53.560]  the reason we're losing our liberty losing our dollar losing our jobs is because we're obsessed
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:57:00.440]  with diversions and distractions the equivalent of modern roman bread and circuses gladiatorial
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:05.560]  distractions and i am sick and tired of it and obama and his controllers know exactly what they're
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:13.000]  doing he calls it a nice diversion in his statement about japan while you're filling out your your
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.680]  your march madness picks he knows it's a diversion and they're keeping us in the dark and there's a
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:25.080]  giant cover-up going on of the radiation coming across the pacific ocean to our country and they
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:34.600]  think it's funny do you understand how big a deal this is this illustrates the sickness of our nation
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:40.440]  and how by design they roll this out as a distraction what did he say here in the disgusting
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.840]  quote he said one of the things i wanted to do on the show was as people are filling out their
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:50.360]  brackets this is obviously a national pastime we all have a great time it's a great diversion
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:55.080]  from what obama the foreign bank stealing 28 trillion taxpayer money that we got to pay

[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:13.080]  divine wind of radiation undoubtedly headed our way and you better believe the government's going
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:18.360]  to try to cover this up now going back to james and i'm going to will richard rob ron and others
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:23.160]  during the health rangers to stay there i'll get to everybody but james you wanted to briefly
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:27.400]  is somebody that worked in nuclear power plants and worked on the the the sub reactors
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:32.360]  who certified in it you wanted to talk about some precautions for people go ahead
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:39.320]  uh yes i did uh but first i uh i just wanted to say i agree a lot with greg palace there
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:44.600]  there is a lot of cover-up and there's a lot of corruption going on in the navy nuclear and
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:49.320]  commercial nuclear fleet uh wasn't surprised to hear that but i was kind of surprised to hear
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:54.600]  that he had been involved in that but um i've talked to a navy captains who were on nuke subs
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:59.560]  one of them uh runs veterans for peace here in austin and they would have them do test
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:03.880]  that they knew were releasing radiation and knowing that it would hurt the crew and many of
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:11.400]  his people died he's sick from it uh but sorry go ahead uh no i believe it because uh i i spent
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:17.080]  years in in that program and they tell you you're trained you're cream of the crop and and they love
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:22.280]  to treat you like filth and uh i got sick of it i got sick and tired of being treated like filth
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:28.360]  i got tired of uh you know having my family being treated like filth so i left and uh it's
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:32.920]  spreading into the civilian fleet especially a turkey point that place is corrupt but uh
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:42.520]  i do know there uh i just want to go real quick into i do know the supplement that has uh 45 doses
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:47.160]  of colloidal minerals that you drink on an empty stomach and it gets absorbed in your
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:51.400]  bloodstream in five minutes and i'm not i'm not plugging anything i'm not making any money i'm
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:57.560]  just saying keep putting this out so i can help people but it does have here i'm reading it about
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:04.600]  150 micrograms of potassium iodide and there's 45 servings in this container yeah well i mean
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:09.560]  look at info wars team dot com we've got the dulce iodine that's even a lot more than that
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:14.040]  there's a lot of natural ways to get stuff to fill up most your thyroid it's not as good as the
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:19.000]  medical grade but it certainly helps i appreciate i appreciate your call james uh let's go ahead

[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:40.920]  as you can japan's radiation problem appears to be out of control it's 49 minutes old no i've got a
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:45.400]  i'm going to cover some news right before our guest joins us after we come out of break no it
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.480]  they're calling it out of control they're now calling it total catastrophe they will not give
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:56.520]  out the radiation readings for many many miles in two states or prefectures as they're called
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:01.720]  in and around fukushima but they've got universities and others who are refusing to go along with
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:06.760]  the cover-up putting out numbers that are very high there's a massive ongoing attempt at cover-up
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:12.920]  here happening right now but what's that headline again radiation uh wait one i'm running back into
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:21.800]  my uh computer room um hold on one second getting it right now uh japan's radiation problem appears
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:27.080]  to be out of control daily journal dot com it's digital journal i appreciate your call we have it
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:32.360]  let me read to you reports japan's radiation problems appear out of control latest reports from
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:37.800]  japan reveal a country grounding and sorrow from last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:43.640]  and it will not have to give undivided attention to a disaster of surging radiation levels at
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:48.440]  fukushima's daichi nuclear facility scientists are warning that the fire is associated with
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:54.920]  explosions at the nuclear plant where uh fuel storage ponds have overheated maybe letting off
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:05:01.800]  radioactive steam yeah you think so no kidding we'll be right back this is alex jones with five
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:07.080]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:12.120]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:17.080]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:22.840]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:28.440]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:33.720]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:38.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:42.760]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power

[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:54.760]  worse than either the mainstream media of the japanese government have been telling us
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:00.040]  the big article that we need to get out to everybody alert fukushima cover-up
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:05.080]  close to 40 years of spent nuclear fuel rods blown sky high they've been storing over 600
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:09.960]  thousand of them on top of the facilities four of them have blown up ejecting them into the air
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:16.280]  and they're the japan is not giving out radiation readings now in those two states bad sign greg
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:22.920]  palace agreed that's a cover-up going on more fires more smoke at the plant boiling off radiation
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:30.520]  fukushima kiyoto news reports number three reactor vent smoke but they are also reporting
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:36.360]  that some of the other reactors have had breached internal seal cores this place is a giant nuclear
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:41.720]  waste dump that's on top of it all a newly released images show devastated nuclear reactors

[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:53.800]  nuke plant station worsened considerably think tank reports the nuke station one
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:58.440]  has worsened considerably the institute for science international security set a statement
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:04.840]  also there's more problems at some of the other plants there there's six total
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:09.080]  including some that have already been turned off but they're still catching on fire
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:13.320]  this stuff's very flat if you put these rods out in the open they catch on fire continuing the
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:18.200]  surgeon general said as a precaution by potassium iodine that other government agencies said don't
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:23.080]  do it we've confirmed from listeners with names and dates that fema and the cdc have been ordered
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:26.760]  in clinics even though it's over the counter to not prescribe it to people that ask for it
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:33.640]  on the west coast continuing japan crisis spurs iodine demand in us sells out everywhere panic
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:39.000]  buying stocks of potassium iodate exhausted the united states military rescuers brace for japan
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:44.600]  radiation in us aid flights coming back i mean one particle of uranium and plutonium it'll kill you
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.080]  you won't have to wait a few years for it to happen it's that slow kill they can cover up at

[02:10:53.000 --> 02:11:00.120]  in japan alone got to pray for those folks again other mainline reports ap reporting that the
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:06.280]  radiation is going out to sea now it's been going from northeast on friday going saturday and sunday
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:12.200]  and monday straight east towards the united states then uh tuesday turning south and giving tokyo a
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:17.480]  dose people now fleeing that uh with with higher and higher levels being registered now it's moved
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:23.880]  back up to going straight uh due east towards our west coast so we've got uh that information
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:28.440]  the aircraft carriers raced 200 miles away when fukushima three blew up monday and high
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:32.280]  radiation levels were picked up they reported ships were radiated some of them uh that's
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:37.960]  associated press as well a roiders report us forces on the island of japan are kept 50 miles away
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:43.320]  from japan nuke plant as if the wind doesn't carry it uh further japan's emperor in historic
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:48.520]  speech says never give up hope japan's beloved emperor the son of the guy that attacked us in
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:54.440]  world war two uh emperor dramatically took to the national tv airways wednesday uh and buoyed the
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:59.960]  spirits of his disaster stricken citizens and extraordinarily uh addressed before a nation
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:04.280]  grappling with the aftermath of an epic earthquake and a devastating tsunami and growing fears of
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:09.400]  nuclear catastrophe i truly hope quote that i truly hope the victims of the disaster never give up
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:15.800]  hope take care of themselves and live strong for tomorrow said the dignified and understated emperor
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:22.920]  a calm and poignant uh oration delivered from the imperial palace also i want citizens of japan
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:27.960]  he said to remember everyone who's been affected by the devastation not only today but for a long
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:37.000]  time afterwards and help with the recovery the 77-year-old ceremonial but deeply revered chief
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:42.600]  of state underlying prime minister kanz earlier assertion that japan was going through its worst
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:47.160]  crisis since world war two and they got a bombs dropped on him at hereshima nakasaki remember
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:51.160]  the atomic energy agency estimates that chernobyl much smaller than this disaster now
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:57.080]  that's undoubted uh only for 10 days had steam coming out and that that radiated over a thousand
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:03.000]  miles swath 150 000 square miles but 100 but but a thousand miles north got heavy radiation there's
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:09.240]  estimated a million deaths from complications associated uh with that event now we've got
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:15.080]  four reactors on fire exploding and you better believe there's a big cover up going on ladies and
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:20.120]  gentlemen uh so that's just some of what we're dealing with but you've got to admire the stoic
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:27.240]  uh genteel calm of the japanese people there's not looting crimes actually on down statistically
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:30.840]  the people are orderly this would have been a lot worse if they weren't but still they
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:35.000]  don't need to be too orderly when this is done and getting justice i'd like to see the owners
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:40.520]  of tokyo electric power and the ceo's that built on a fault line and stored the rods on top of
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:46.600]  the reactors i'd like to see them in there not the police not the military not the plant workers
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:51.240]  in there on a suicide mission oh but they're they're elitist so it's evil to talk about about them
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:59.320]  now joining us uh is mike adams and mike adams of course is the health ranger heads up natural news
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:04.600]  naturalnews.com he really needs no introduction but he's been warning about these type of situations
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:09.160]  he happened to be in austin and we're honored to have him in here riding shotgun with us we're
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:16.440]  going to talk for about 15 minutes and i promise go directly to your calls at 1-800-259-9231
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:20.920]  mike adams uh good to have you here what do you make of all this what's good to be here alex a great
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:26.120]  summary of the situation this is the cover-up that they can't cover up you know when when when
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:30.920]  radiation when there's a meltdown when there's fissionable material being released into the
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:36.360]  atmosphere they can't cover this up they can cover up vaccines for a while they can cover up gmo's
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:42.040]  for a while fluoride in the water for decades but not this and so this is a turning point
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:47.240]  not just for the future of nuclear power but also for people who have been let's say listening to you
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:53.400]  for year after year and wondering is alex really right is he is he overstating it or is he on target
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:57.800]  well this morning we posted on on facebook on our own facebook page that we're going to be on your
[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:04.360]  show here and the first comment from a person was alex jones was right you know and and i know
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:08.680]  you're not ego driven it doesn't matter to you to hear that but for those listening it's an important
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:12.920]  point that when we've been warning you and i both have been warning for a long time and you for many
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:17.560]  more years than i about preparedness about the dangers in the world about the cover-ups about
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.400]  governments not telling people the truth because when we let them get away with cover-ups they get
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.720]  more and more arrogant more and more crazy themselves there's no governor you're saying this is a major
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:32.440]  game changer sorry it is a game changer because now if if the lies about the safety of nuclear power
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:37.080]  can be so devastating and so catastrophic to the people of japan and perhaps even to the people
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:42.920]  of north america it raises the question you know what else have we been lied about what else has been
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:49.160]  done in the name of so-called scientific thinking for example gmo's are now being pushed under
[02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:54.360]  science and anyone who questions them is called unscientific you know what all the science actually
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:59.480]  shows they're deadly well well it does but they're trying to hide behind that label right and and
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:06.440]  nuclear power was given to us as a progression of of civilization this was supposed to be
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:12.440]  clean energy virtually limitless energy folks think it's trendy to just mindlessly support it
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.360]  well exactly and there are a lot of things like that that are happening in our world today
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:20.120]  you've talked about here fluoride in the water for example the the pharmaceutical
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:24.600]  medicaid genetic engineering absolutely the list just goes on and the hadron superconducting
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:28.680]  supercollider a lot of physicists are on record saying it could destroy the planet these are guys
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:33.000]  with phd's and then the and then the people at hadron say well that's a low probability
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.880]  they're going to do thousands of tests well exactly and what you get to behind all this
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:45.880]  is the arrogance of the science of the scientists combined with the corruption of the politicians
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:50.600]  and as you call them the global elite they're believing their own lies they do believe them
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:55.160]  and they're willing to risk the lives of the public in order to pursue their own agenda
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:59.640]  when they built these power plants remember those g e engineers who who quit because they
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:05.400]  said this isn't a safe design it's not safe uh no one listened to them that was back in the 70s
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:10.120]  and now decades later we're starting to to look at a time when we're going to have to pay a price
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:14.920]  and people's i mean an engineer lost their job they got blackballed when they quit they didn't
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:18.440]  just do this just like the genetic engineer guys that were making a million bucks a year
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:22.520]  and they come out and say this potato sterilizes you we can't put this on the market they're like
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:27.640]  you're fired well that's right time and time again those who raise the warnings are either
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:32.120]  ridiculed by the mainstream media if if they're folks like you well we said this was a meltdown
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:37.400]  friday but yeah you were ahead of this way ahead of of us doing it in fact uh i was looking at your
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:42.520]  news and saying wow you guys have an incredible news system going on here by the way uh paul watson
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:47.240]  just does incredible work but you were on top of this story before the mainstream media was really
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:51.320]  on board with it and they're still not on board with the truth of what's happening the truth is
[02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:56.520]  well no they're on board with a big cover up well right let me look at what they're talking about
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:01.480]  today that's not what people need to know what do people need to know today in america they need to
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:07.080]  know to get prepared they need to know uh natural sources of iodine which you've talked about here
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:12.360]  but beyond that they need to know that their government is not telling them the truth on
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:17.800]  so many topics that nuclear energy is just the tip of the iceberg here there's so much more
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:23.400]  coming down the road fiat currency the federal reserve the global debt biometrics they now admit
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:28.120]  10 times the radiation they'd said in secret tests at the airports with the scanners mass of
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:34.360]  cancer increase they just think they can wave baloney wands and and and and change the laws of
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:38.440]  physics that's exactly what they're trying to do and now they're fighting the laws of physics
[02:18:38.440 --> 02:18:45.160]  and the laws of physics are winning in in tokyo sat sadly the laws of physics and fission reality
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:50.520]  reality exactly reality is something you can't avoid the laws of economics for example you can't
[02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:54.440]  run the world on a global and they'll try to play it down when japanese start dying
[02:18:54.440 --> 02:19:00.520]  and when radiation hits the us but still the reality is there it's it's cause and effect alex
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:04.120]  and we have set into motion on this planet through through the corruption through the
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:07.960]  governments that don't tell us the truth through the the science that has been distorted for these
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:13.640]  corporate agendas we've set into motion a chain of events that's now coming back to haunt us and
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:17.640]  so many americans it's like real popular now to make jokes i hear it all over radio about the
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:22.600]  japanese these are little kids dying folks people being ready men fighting for everybody else's
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:26.920]  safety knowing they're dying they're on record saying we're ready to die and people are making
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:32.280]  jokes folks you think you're safe those of you out there making jokes uh when when when we're
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:36.760]  such a decadent society that people don't care who's going to save your butt who's going to step
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:40.280]  up for you you know that's sick that's sick i didn't know people were out there making jokes

[02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:12.680]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:16.920]  it's true seeds at all perform even golden silver before in this country and it's possible that
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:22.040]  could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:28.680]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient

[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:37.800]  also they can listen at info wars dot com or watch us at present planet dot tv here's some big
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:42.520]  breaking news i was given during the break this is a beta test you heard six months ago that they
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:47.400]  want an internet kill switch during emergencies they would reroute everything to government websites
[02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:53.000]  this is a beta test to kind of condition you and and to show people that they have this power
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:58.680]  us military blocks websites to help japan recovery efforts really they won't send the troops in and
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:03.240]  are covering up the radiation levels for the public but they're doing this and it says the
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:07.160]  u.s military has blocked access to a range of popular commercial websites in order to free
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:11.880]  up bandwidth for use in japan recovery efforts according to an email obtained by cnn and confirmed
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:17.160]  by spokesman for the u.s strategic strategic command the sites include youtube espn amazon
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:22.840]  ebay mtv were chosen not because of the content because they were popularity among users in the
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:27.640]  military computers account for significant bandwidth according to strategic command spokesman
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:31.560]  and they don't even go on to say they were having trouble with their networks they're just setting
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:37.000]  that precedent with a little step and they go through it mike adams they're openly pushing
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:42.040]  that they want to start curtailing the web because alternative media is kicking their hind end well
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.160]  that's very true alex and if you look at the reasoning behind this they say look they're
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:50.040]  going to free up bandwidth to help in japan's recovery efforts i mean you can't email people
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:54.840]  food you can't email potassium iodide to the population i'm not sure how this is going to
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:26:00.600]  help japan recover what they need is to is to cool the spent fuel rods right and you can't do that
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:04.200]  over the internet you got to get ships in there with pumps and the pentagon is keeping the us
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:08.120]  ships away from there and japan's not able to tackle that situation as they as they should
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:14.680]  have been able to so this is clearly not a rescue effort like you say it sounds like a beta test
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:19.880]  of a of an internet blocking effort i mean what what else could the explanation be for this i mean
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:24.600]  this is well it sets the precedent normalizes it well that's exactly and that's what they do
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:28.920]  every time there's a crisis we've seen it you know in hady we've seen it with hurricane katrina
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:36.360]  here in texas and lesiana every time there's a crisis they use it to jump on one more effort to
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:42.280]  take away your freedoms or take away your access or spin their agenda in a new way and position it
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:47.400]  as a rescue effort this is that's exactly what we're looking at here i believe it's like oh well
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:52.600]  because they admit six months ago they may kill the whole internet and and send you to government
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:58.440]  sites during emergencies and so there's no doubt that that is uh what this is epa is announcing
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:03.720]  that it's increasing radiation monitoring in the united states that's up on prisonplanet.com
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:08.680]  the latest article by steve watson again our reporters are doing a great job tracking everything
[02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:13.000]  well the the issue here alex is if i get in a rut for a second that when they send you to
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:18.120]  government websites that is not usually the best source of information if ever no it's to control
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:23.880]  info exactly the best source of information as your listeners well know is of course the alternative
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:27.800]  media that's where you're going to get the truth about what's happening ahead of the mainstream
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:32.280]  media that's where you're going to get intelligent interpretation a wide spectrum of analysis
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:37.400]  that's exactly right you're going to get analysis that the mainstream media is not allowed to do
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:42.840]  think about these new plants those are general electric parts i mean those are those were built
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:47.960]  by general electric which of course owns many of the major media outlets in the united states or
[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:52.360]  or is heavily invested in them you think the mainstream media is going to go out there and
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:55.880]  start telling people about the structural engineering well the former head of general
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:00.520]  electric runs the white house economic council it's all tied in together exactly like that
[02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:04.040]  so when they're when they're testing shutting down the internet what they're really doing
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:09.720]  is testing to see if people will buy into the idea that all information should be centrally
[02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:13.560]  controlled during emergencies during emergencies which they've said is they're planted with the
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:18.120]  internet kill switch and what's an headline obama wants kill switch during emergencies for a whole
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:22.200]  web we put that on screen and they can declare an emergency for just about anything as you well
[02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:26.680]  know they can declare an emergency if the dollar drops 20 percent in one day they could declare
[02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:31.320]  an emergency that's in the executive orders says any reason well in there right it could be for no
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:35.400]  reason it could be for a reason that's secret because they say this is a threat to national
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:40.920]  security and we can't tell you why but it's just an emergency and now all the internet is is blocked
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:46.120]  are funneled to their sources of information you know that's the day alex that that folks like you
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:53.400]  and other alternative media sites are are really going to have to get out there and use use the
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:58.120]  underground avenue that's why we've got people hanging the flyers learning the power of just
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:04.520]  flyers with messages local micro fm i mean there's people have got to really appreciate the web
[02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:08.520]  while we've got it as they try to kill it that's that's right the web continues to be the best
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:13.080]  source of information and especially the alternative well it was a kid with a cell phone shooting the
[02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:18.120]  mushroom cloud that would have been covered up lots of things like like the police beatings of
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:23.400]  these innocent people and the tasering of innocent senior citizens for example it's like the cop on
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:30.920]  that uh in in in in portland and not in portland in um in in california in the bay area in oakland
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:34.680]  where they confiscate two of the cameras but somebody still secretly shot when they shoot the
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:39.080]  guy in the back and then lie about it uh and then it came out that they had basically just executed
[02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:43.240]  him in the cop went to jail this is a double-edged sword and the system doesn't like it we're gonna

[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:07.960]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:13.240]  your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:18.120]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:23.400]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:28.600]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:32:28.600 --> 02:32:33.800]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:38.360]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:42.920]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:47.160]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:17.160]  all right we're going into a full fourth hour of overdrive today my cadams will be with us for
[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:20.920]  30 minutes into that in the last 30 minutes i'll continue to cover the latest developments with
[02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:27.080]  the Fukushima uh japan insanity there's other reactors having problems who knows what the
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:33.960]  truth is on those i've got a report about leaking with water at a canadian nuke plant today being
[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:39.640]  overshadowed by this obama's moving with anti-gun legislation while we're all busy watching this
[02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:46.120]  we've got incredible police state news huge middle east news amazingly important us news and world
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:51.560]  politics and the economy stack that's in the last 30 minutes of overdrive today that i haven't even
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:34:00.680]  gotten to in other news stocks fall on japan crisis weak economic reports the japanese stock market
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:05.560]  lost more than 11 points in the last few days we're getting you the latest on that we're about to go
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:10.600]  to your calls but stocks fall on japan crisis weak economic reports japan's nuclear crisis
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:15.640]  disappointing economic reports caused stocks to fall worsening fears about the nuclear crisis
[02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:21.000]  in japan shook financial markets today stocks open lower then dropped sharply in mid-morning
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.240]  trading after the european union's energy chief was quoted as saying that japan's nuclear crisis
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:32.360]  could get worse no kidding uh duh not winning treasury prices jump sending yields to their
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:39.080]  lowest level this year's investors piled into investments seen as being more stable like farmland
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:47.240]  gold commodities the dowell jones industrial average fell 265 points or 2.3 to 11 590 the
[02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:55.880]  standard imports 500 index fell 29 the cboe market volatility index jumped 18 percentage points a
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:35:01.960]  sign that investors seek more volatility or see more and expect more uh volatility in the stock
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:06.680]  market japan temporarily suspended work in a stricken nuclear plan effort a surge in radiation
[02:35:06.680 --> 02:35:11.240]  made it too dangerous for workers to remain there that came a day after japan's prime minister said
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:16.120]  four crippled reactors at the nuclear power plant were leaking dangerous amounts of radiation but
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:21.480]  not giving the numbers and neither is our government swarming with spy aircraft and
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:27.960]  submarines and radiation snoops not telling us because we're in the fallout path cover up
[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:33.240]  that's the big news here the big one of the biggest nuke dumps in the world 600 000 spent rods
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:38.760]  blowing around everywhere two reactor cores breached all right i said i'd go to your calls but
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:43.880]  but briefly mike adams your take on the issue and we wrote about this last night it's still the
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:49.400]  most detailed report out there we hope folks get it out alarm overspent fuel rods threatens chair
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:54.840]  noble on steroids and we have another report uh with the headline that uh japanese Fukushima
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:36:01.800]  disaster spewed radioactive rods into the atmosphere your take on that well in in the chair noble
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:07.080]  incident alex you got to remember that after the meltdown occurred 400 times erishima and it was much
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:13.080]  smaller the huge radiation introduced directly into the atmosphere they had to have volunteers who
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:18.440]  who were wearing these these almost like spacesuits these robot suits who would go in there and they
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:23.240]  could work for a maximum of 40 seconds alex because that was the maximum radiation exposure
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:28.200]  that they could get for a lifetime just to go in there and help cover up the core that had
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:32.360]  melted and most those guys died they would run in and shovel and then run you know exactly exactly
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:37.800]  these are these are suicide actions and now japan is facing that because they've already said it's
[02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:41.320]  too dangerous to let the workers go in there and they're they're staying in for full shifts they're
[02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:46.840]  dead they are valiant heroes well well they are there there are many heroes being being made today
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:52.280]  in addition to many failures that have happened but that's a hero not some ncaa college basketball
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:57.240]  person i totally agree with you i i'm not even looking at the sports scene in america today
[02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:04.440]  why who who i mean we got to focus on the future of human civilization life on our planet how are
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:08.840]  we going to stay alive how are we going to keep radiation out of the food supply here in america
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:12.760]  and as long as we're talking about the food supply what do you what do you have there i'm just showing
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:18.600]  folks on tv uh continue well i i know this isn't a show about gmo's but i want to say one sentence
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:25.960]  i believe that gmo's are the the the fukushima meltdown of the agricultural industry just waiting
[02:37:25.960 --> 02:37:31.400]  now well it's taking over a regular natural farming uh it's it's been proven in every major study
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:36.040]  to be causing all sorts of problems even in b is not just humans i mean the evidence is overwhelming
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:40.120]  we're going to talk about that next hour before you leave no no we're gonna we're gonna talk about
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:44.840]  the other things that they're covering up coming up the start of the next hour but but before we
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:49.720]  go to calls last point that i'm going to richard rob trevor chuck jackie i promise i wanted to raise
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:55.880]  this obama plays while japan begs for help now that's the info wars headline the prison planet
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:01.800]  headline is obama fiddles while fukushima burns and it goes over the fact that uh he's spending
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:07.480]  hours talking about march madness today stupid basketball and this is the president this is the
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:11.800]  leader and and and he's and he said it's a good distraction from what's happening in the world
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:17.080]  in a white house press release it's a distraction they want it to be a distraction from the fall
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:21.240]  out coming our way yes clearly they want to be distractions like you said in the previous hour
[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:26.280]  this is bread and circuses for america instead of focusing on what we need to focus on which is our
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:31.320]  safety our preparedness accurate information about the situation in japan instead of that
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:36.040]  we're talking about basketball stars and that the president is doing that where's and and folks if
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:40.040]  you're on the west coast and your child gets a dose of it because fast growing cells in children
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:44.920]  it's many they estimate 20 plus times on average more dangerous for children and your child suddenly
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:51.320]  gets leukemia or gets bone cancer which they admit this is good uh can can cause it will march madness
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:56.520]  be funny when you're putting your kid in a coffin but see remember alex the cancer industry has never
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:39:01.160]  been about preventing cancer as you well know we've talked about it so they might actually like this
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.640]  they might actually like it because now you have higher risks of cancer guess what you're going to
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:11.400]  have a message from the white house to say more women go get mammograms now which of course irradiate
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:16.440]  women's breasts even more through the you said that years ago now that's mainline studies now it is
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:20.760]  right it was considered a radical idea the epa now says they want to pull fluoride out of the water
[02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:25.160]  admitting it's killing people right right you know one by one these lies are being exposed alex and
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:29.800]  it's due to the alternative media that's the only place that we're going to cover it next hour that's
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:33.480]  why you're here with continual coverage with us i look forward in the near future when you're back
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:38.040]  in austin setting in i know you're going to be here a little bit next week maybe maybe next week
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:42.280]  you could come in for a day and fill in i don't know how is that no one can fill in yes you can
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:47.400]  how about we have Watson next friday do have to show you to the other half i'd be happy to fill
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:51.560]  in whenever it's a we'll work it out before you leave then you could cover it all let's talk to
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:56.520]  richard and vermont thanks for holding richard you're on the air worldwide how you doing alex yeah
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:40:03.880]  this is richard and vermont i'm a certified first class nuclear welder of 13 years uh 61 years old
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:10.600]  i retired from that i read uh the turning point by free job capra back in 1984 and immediately
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:16.280]  removed myself from welding uh the reactor cores and submarines because i saw potential danger in
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:23.000]  that so that just to qualify myself but i wanted to let you know that um what you actually saw
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:29.960]  what you and i actually saw flying out of the top of number three there was uh 3450 of those
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:37.240]  fuel rods 7 000 of them over 7 000 of them have been compromised uh the rest of them the rest of
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:41.400]  the 600 000 are sitting and spent fuel rods that's right and for those that don't know we
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:46.120]  covered it first hour the japanese government admits it one plant 70 percent are exposed
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:52.280]  at the other 33 give people an idea they're now saying live rods explain to people what
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:56.040]  what if you got one little gram of one of those live rods and put it your mouth what would happen
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:03.960]  if uh okay say if you've got to be if you've got a beam of light uh shining to the sunlight
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:07.240]  shining through the windows and you're dusting your furniture and you see those little particles
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:12.680]  of dust floating around in the air if one of those particles of dust went over one of these
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:18.680]  radiated rods and became irradiated itself and say your your pet dog went walking by
[02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:24.360]  or god forbid uh your child or yourself was walking by and inhales that and it goes into
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:29.880]  your nose down into your lungs you're dead you're dead you're dead in a matter of if not the first
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:35.160]  day you're dead you what it does it goes in there and starts rupturing all of the cells in the body
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:41.160]  and it it's radiation it's not like it goes through the bloodstream it irradiates through
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:46.920]  everything just like an x-ray you know and that's what it does and it while it is radiating what
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:50.760]  it's doing is it's destroying all the cell that book written by one of the nuclear physicists
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:55.800]  have actually read the excerpts from it they talk about the studies where if a dog gets one
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:02.200]  particle of enriched uranium or plutonium it's dead within days particle of dust you know the
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:05.720]  people now people might get the idea that you might be talking about a particle of plutonium
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:10.600]  coming off of one of the rods that's not it and that's heavy so it would have trouble going across
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:14.840]  the pacific but everything that's touching it everything that's touching it and then and then
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:19.960]  aerosolizing man that that it sounds like things are worse than what i'm saying oh it's a hell of
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:25.000]  a lot worse here's here's the bad part of it what you and i saw flying into the water and
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:32.200]  out of the reactor and come down crashing on the ground guaranteed a lot of those rods fell into
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:37.240]  the water okay now what we've been talking about is a jet stream that's going around and it's going
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:42.680]  to carry this across to the to the west coast it's absolutely positively going to happen it's going
[02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:47.160]  to happen and by the way it doesn't dissipate uranium is four uh well folks give me the half
[02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:51.080]  life of what is it a uranium 236 what's in the rods
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:59.720]  no no i'm asking richard richard do you know the particular isotope of uranium that's in the rods
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:06.840]  no i don't sir i believe it's uranium 236 i believe is i think it's plutonium 236 that's
[02:43:06.840 --> 02:43:11.560]  that's the that's the killer and that's what there's plutonium as well guys just look up the half life
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:19.400]  of of uh of uh basic uranium i believe it's four billion three hundred million so the point is
[02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:23.560]  it it falls on seaweed the seaweed gets the radiation the seaweed washes up a year later
[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:29.000]  dries becomes wind blows across it basically never ends this isn't like oil you dump in your
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  backyard and it goes away the point is whatever the half life is it's billions of years and and
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.560]  as dr bowman the former head of the star wars program three degrees a nuclear physicist
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:44.520]  in nuclear physics said yesterday we will see increased cancer rates in the u.s from this sorry go
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:49.160]  ahead absolutely okay the other part of it is that you're talking about the seaweed and everything
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:53.400]  like that everybody's looking at the jet stream and watching that come around what people need to
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:44:00.760]  do is look up on wikipedia ocean current because these things also went into the water and that
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:06.760]  ocean current the stream of the ocean goes around right past your pan and and it does a it does a
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:12.360]  curl around and it starts heading east and then it it it circulates right up the west coast going
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:19.000]  northward off the west coast okay so if you're not only are you going to be getting the the um
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:23.080]  the jet stream which is poisoned by these things which means it's going to be coming down out of
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:28.360]  the sky in the form of snow and rain and but it's going to also be poisoning all the water you're
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.920]  going to be seeing billions and billions of of wildlife coming up out and washing up on the
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:38.360]  shores uh everywhere i died i would hate to live in australia right now what about seafood it is
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:42.280]  that the ossees are the ones really freaking out they understand because they've dealt with japan's
[02:44:42.280 --> 02:44:47.560]  lies uh you're about to talk about seafood well well your caller is absolutely right and look
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:53.480]  at seafood right now we're worried about mercury and seafood what about radioactive seafood how uh all
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:58.520]  the fishing areas that are in the pacific between japan and the west coast of the united states and
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:04.200]  the west coast of mexico and canada uh these could be impacted now we could be remember the mad max
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:08.680]  movie where where they were selling water and they had the the radiation meter testing the water
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:13.800]  the mel Gibson character is this radioactive water we might have to start doing that for our food
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:19.080]  well let's go back we've got a basic graph of the general uh ocean currents and you can see it goes
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:26.440]  right up by Fukushima and does go east hits the united states right up at the canadian border turns
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:32.760]  up and runs around alaska through the key fishing grounds and then back again and circles there holy
[02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:38.600]  mackerel yeah yeah so we're talking not only air there we're not being killed by air we're being
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:44.040]  killed by land and by sea um the other thing that i wanted to say and this is a caveat for people
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:49.560]  living on the west coast all right your children do not let them go out and have snowball fights
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:54.040]  and make snowmen starting like right now it's a good practice start getting into we've only got a
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:58.760]  few days left before this stuff starts coming down on us what they need to do when they go outside
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:05.080]  is wear things like long plastic hooded plastic it's got to be plastic hooded ponchos and these
[02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:10.760]  things have got to be rinsed off on a daily basis and also the children or you or whoever your pets
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:16.120]  got to be rinsed on a daily basis in the shower okay and that's for upper body have you heard
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:21.480]  obama is going to do a south american trip now i guess he won't be here he's heading out man if he
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:25.720]  if he wasn't if he didn't have something set up for for the south america he'd be going down into
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:33.720]  his alice bunker um anyways uh be sure also to wear the hood on on any kind of a plastic poncho
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:37.480]  they're going to have a big sale on ponchos anybody that's uh that's listening right now
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:40.920]  because that'll help protect them from what's going to be coming down out of the sky whether
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:46.760]  it's snow or rain no snowball fights no splashing around in mud puddles um the other thing is to
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:52.520]  be let be sure to wear the hood and uh plastic bags on their shoes or by the way this sounds
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:58.920]  extreme but folks this isn't a joke you get any of this uranium or plutonium you're dead and they'll
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:03.240]  just say we don't know i mean look 30 years ago i've talked to doctors if they found a kid with
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:06.920]  cancer they would send doctors from all over the country to see him it was so rare now kids all
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:12.600]  of my neighborhood are dying it's just like it's normal it's fun everyone's dying oh yeah yep and
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:17.320]  this is a movie you don't get tired of seeing either it's ridiculous it just keeps on coming
[02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:21.720]  uh plastic bags on their shoes out of the stores are giving up plastic bags like crazy they're
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:27.320]  floating all over the pacific uh i'm sure they got plastic bags all around the house start saving
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:31.560]  them put them on your kid's shoes when they go outside and take them and well what about this
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:35.880]  the government is out there they know the real radiation levels they're they're getting the test
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:39.400]  and they're not telling us they're saying how we might do a test you know tomorrow or something
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:43.480]  maybe and the japanese are not releasing the numbers we've shown the nuke maps they they keep
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:48.920]  saying oh we're still collating data they're not letting us know that is a crime by the criminal
[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:52.440]  federal government and the japanese government my god well alex the government knows that there's
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:57.240]  not enough supply of ponchos not enough supply of potassium iodide not enough seaweed in the
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:02.040]  supply chain if they tell they should be doing weather reports about they're testing the clouds
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:05.880]  they know when they're gonna head and they have radiation reports and they say get ready they
[02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:09.960]  should they should be doing that but the government has never really told me they get the troops do
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:13.720]  you to use knowing it's going to kill them exactly they'll probably tell kids to go out and breathe
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:20.760]  deep well the the fact is japan the grocery store shelves are wiped out and they have been for days
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:26.040]  that kind of supply line deficiency exists in the united states as well if everybody decides to do
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:32.200]  something all at once it's too late this is this is really this whole show should be about the the
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:37.320]  urgency of preparedness for everything that well your life is too valuable i'll be honest if i was
[02:48:37.320 --> 02:48:41.720]  in because i've been studying the weather maps the main areas northern california up to southern
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:45.800]  um you know for the jet stream that's the big issue and it's supposed to get here in the next
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:52.920]  few days um i mean if i live there i would take a vacation i mean i would go south i mean i i mean
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:57.400]  this is not a joke ladies and gentlemen this is not a joke and and see they already have tens of
[02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:01.480]  thousands different the tsunami and notice they said 10 000 the first day and then they never really
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:05.880]  said again a whole town of 10 000 is missing so it's way over that that'll be a perfect cover
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:09.960]  for them with other people dying of radiation sickness they'll just kind of ignore it all the
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:17.240]  medial cover it up well that's exactly right and i i i wanted to ask uh your caller here uh did you
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:23.080]  have it's richard correct yes sorry did you have colleagues who who did not quit their jobs with the
[02:49:23.080 --> 02:49:28.520]  military and then suffered from cancer later on because of their focus on working on the the nuclear
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:33.480]  reactors well i had the the guy that actually showed me how to well died died of what they
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:37.720]  call black lung because back when we were working on the boats they didn't uh ocean didn't have a
[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:43.880]  law up against the use of asbestos and we used to cover uh parts of the uh the internal uh
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:50.360]  workings of the reactors with asbestos blankets and asbestos diesel something else they told us
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:56.200]  was nutritious yeah yeah mezzel steaming over person and general dynamics one of its primary
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:01.080]  products is asbestos all right and here we are as well as welders and stuff with our sparks dropping
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:05.800]  on top of this stuff and then these little puffs of of dust would come up out of them while the
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:10.200]  guy that uh a Puerto Rican guy that showed me how to do my welding and stuff like that and actually
[02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:16.760]  got me up to the first class secret uh i had a secret clearance um uh he died of black lung at
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:22.040]  that 63 years old i'm 61 and i'm and i'm sure that was their cover for what he really died of
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:25.640]  right there's so many cases of this alex we have dentists out there who are losing their minds
[02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:29.720]  because of mercury exposure we have pharmacists who are getting cancer because they're dishing out
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:34.840]  chemotherapy pills to patients just from touching just from touching the pills they're getting cancer
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:39.960]  the nuclear industry of course is they admit that 44 percent of the ink we use sterilizes men
[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:45.960]  and the bpa on the receipts too don't forget about that the chemicals just never never stop poisoning
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:51.160]  us but they tell us you're a conspiracy theorist even though it's all admitted Richard Greypoint's

[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:08.920]  little crazy but i know that people have yeah your phone's cutting out there rob
[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:14.680]  yeah it can be better now yeah you gotta head down go ahead okay i know there's some people
[02:55:14.680 --> 02:55:20.600]  saying that it might be because of harp now yeah one of you guys on your show saying that
[02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:26.680]  might have been a potential explosion by someone inside setting up well they got hit by a big
[02:55:26.680 --> 02:55:32.440]  tsunami in a 9.1 earthquake though i mean and their harp can the government says secretary
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:37.240]  defense 97 cohen said it that the governments are working on earthquake weapons but we don't
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:43.800]  know if that's what's happening that that would just be speculation okay now the thing is is that
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:49.960]  me and my wife went to uh walmart and little to new york sure and uh we asked the pharmacist for
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:55.000]  some potassium iodide the pharmacist looked at me looked and kind of was looking at me kind of
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:56:02.040]  crazy thinking i was i was nuts so they didn't have it so i went to one here in town nobody's
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:07.240]  got it absolutely nobody well it's all over the news the attorney the surgeon general said get it
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:13.160]  if you can yesterday but see if it's something that's smart it's crazy what you want you care
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:18.840]  you you want to be prepared here's some kind of lunatic i appreciate your call rob um let's talk
[02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:27.640]  to trevor in canada you're on the air trevor well yes sir uh i i mentioned that part of
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:33.720]  japan for nearly 20 years and uh you know one of the real tragedies is of course japan has
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:39.320]  no zoning laws and they've you know they've built these factories in these regions to keep them out
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:46.920]  of the sites of the site of the larger population base areas and um it's really quite tragic because
[02:56:46.920 --> 02:56:51.400]  now you know these rural communities are going to be annihilated because of the location and the
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:59.080]  placement of these factories and um my wife's Japanese we moved to canada this year and um
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:05.080]  we're following the news from japan here in canada and i can tell you it um is definitely not on the
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:11.720]  same level of coverage as we're seeing in the international news so they're trying to downplay
[02:57:11.720 --> 02:57:20.360]  the events oh they're not releasing radiation numbers in the two key states no as as you've
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:25.640]  already noted the program it's um the japanese media is is really softening the information
[02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:32.040]  trying to obviously you know prevent the panic um again it's for me to prevent the government
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:36.920]  from getting in trouble and and what do you think's going to happen here when us designed reactors are
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:42.520]  involved what's like uh jen and the politano has said if you see something say something alex but
[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:48.200]  not if it's a meltdown right i mean where where's the honest reporting on that her slogan well we've
[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:51.720]  tried to call those see something say something numbers they never call back they don't answer
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:55.640]  it's all fake of course it's all about paranoia not trusting each other but your calling makes
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:58:00.280]  a good point here about the agriculture base of japan japan right now is so dependent on imported
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:05.720]  food right now and with this disaster its agricultural capacity is going to be reduced
[02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:11.320]  even further creating uh less food security for well what happened in ukraine is they just kept
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:16.840]  you kept still growing on the crops radioactive food and then the people die of cancer exactly and
[02:58:16.840 --> 02:58:23.720]  the globalists are pleased that's coming anything else uh trevor what you want to know more about
[02:58:23.720 --> 02:58:28.200]  the area specifically because i know it intimately but uh know that it both covers it well stay there
[02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:32.840]  let's do it a minute or so with you on the other side giving us little tips on the area of fukushima
[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:37.560]  there in northeast japan then we'll talk to chuck jackie matthew and then we're going to break down
[02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:48.120]  some of the other big cover-ups going on stay with us this is gcn the genesis communications radio

[02:58:56.760 --> 02:59:01.800]  by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right here in the united states
[02:59:01.800 --> 02:59:07.480]  ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in february
[02:59:07.480 --> 02:59:13.240]  and pump prices are expected to reach five dollars a gallon because of shipping costs food is being
[02:59:13.240 --> 02:59:19.160]  priced out of the reach of millions of americans with an expected 35 jump in the next 60 days

[02:59:54.520 --> 03:00:13.320]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:19.560]  i had i'm writing shotgun with us for at least another 30 minutes i'm gonna get into some of
[03:00:19.560 --> 03:00:25.160]  the other news that hasn't been covered in the middle east the economy the police state recapped
[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:30.040]  some of the latest developments with the unfolding disaster and cover up in japan with the radiation
[03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:34.600]  coming our way but we're taking your phone calls right now trevor in canada was going to give us a
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:39.080]  few more tips because he lived in that area of japan just moved to canada with a japanese wife
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:43.000]  in the last year and you were gonna give us some tips about the area go ahead sir
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:50.840]  it's a very rural part of japan um to the point they don't even have a major highway system connecting
[03:00:50.840 --> 03:00:56.200]  that kashima area yet they've um just started to build into that region and that's one of the things
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:01.480]  that's um delaying the relief efforts um the only way to get into those areas at this point is to
[03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:06.760]  count the center of the country over the mountainous areas and down some very narrow um mountainous
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:12.200]  roads to the coast um what one thing i am noticing in the international media is they're sort of
[03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:19.720]  overplaying the damage to um by saying for example sendai has been devastated well sendai is a huge
[03:01:19.720 --> 03:01:25.640]  city it's 20 kilometers inland those areas weren't actually affected it's the coastal areas near
[03:01:25.640 --> 03:01:31.720]  sendai and there's no doubt not to downplay anything the coastal towns have been ravaged
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:38.040]  really badly we know many of our friends have lost their homes and so it is a great tragedy but
[03:01:38.040 --> 03:01:43.880]  again the bigger tragedy is um again how much information they're hiding from their own people
[03:01:43.880 --> 03:01:48.280]  and these are rural areas these people are um you know they don't have a lot of means and
[03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:53.560]  they're going to suffer greatly from this and not just the physical loss of their properties
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:58.520]  but Trevor could could i ask you a question about the culture of japan and how how they're
[03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:04.040]  handling this issue why why is it you think that they there's so much calm and order in japan
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:10.040]  even in the face of of this catastrophe whereas perhaps in many other regions of the world it
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:14.920]  wouldn't be the case it would be a lot more chaotic what you live there what are your thoughts on that
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:22.360]  well one of the reasons you know to be completely frank is japan is very much a uh big brother
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:27.560]  society now and they have been for a large part of their history it's always come down from the
[03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:33.400]  top and people do move and react based on what they're told but do you think that's going to
[03:02:33.400 --> 03:02:37.720]  last what if people realize that they're not being told the truth will that hold out or will
[03:02:37.720 --> 03:02:43.640]  they start to break and rebel against their own government it's pretty hard to do when that's been
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:48.680]  a mindset you've grown up with they didn't rebel for a year when the u.s bombed every square inch
[03:02:48.680 --> 03:02:55.160]  of their cities uh in areas definitely you know the people are smarter than you know
[03:02:55.160 --> 03:02:59.320]  than we're giving them credit for they know what's going on but it's it's hard because you're fighting
[03:02:59.320 --> 03:03:04.280]  a system that's been in place for a long time and um they're going to have a hard go of it and i
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:10.280]  think they'll probably ultimately be left to their own uh to deal with it themselves you know that
[03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:15.320]  area will just be sort of written off and they keep trying to evacuate tokyo with 37 million
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:19.240]  that that's a disaster in and of itself thank you traver good to hear from you real quick call
[03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:23.560]  lord and the rest of this two minutes chuck in new york you're on the air
[03:03:23.560 --> 03:03:31.480]  are you doing alex and mike good to talk to you um real quick thing uh well the first thing i
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:38.840]  uh wouldn't have brought this up but um i've actually worked in telecommunications television
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:43.880]  for quite a number of years they've had an internet kill switch and they've had a uh
[03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:50.920]  uh numerous ways including a black box in every transmitter and cable system that's in
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:55.640]  this country yeah no that's true they're just now getting us ready for its use now
[03:03:56.680 --> 03:04:04.280]  exactly but um my point i live 25 miles away from a couple of nuclear reactors one of them might be
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:12.440]  a mark one it's very very old about six years ago they had a big uh local blitz where they were
[03:04:12.440 --> 03:04:19.240]  you could go to the pharmacy and get uh potassium iodate and everybody could get it and um
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:26.520]  um my actually my i've had my own i know where i live but my wife went and got some and they were
[03:04:26.520 --> 03:04:32.840]  in nice blister packs and i was out of town working and when i said oh i'd like to pick
[03:04:32.840 --> 03:04:39.800]  some up to have in my uh my pack and i went there three weeks later after that and suddenly
[03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:47.640]  no one had it anymore yeah they've had a federal program to encourage people around reactors
[03:04:47.640 --> 03:04:52.840]  to get potassium iodate but only protects you from one type of radiation and so yeah there's
[03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:57.720]  a big program there good points chuck thank you jackie mathew kent we'll take those calls then
[03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:02.200]  we're gonna get into some other issues and the latest on the nukes this special announcement

[03:08:19.880 --> 03:08:30.200]  texas alex jones my Adams is our guest here i've got a lot of other news on the police state the
[03:08:30.200 --> 03:08:36.120]  middle east u.s of world politics the economy that we're going to be covering at the bottom of the
[03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:43.320]  hour also the latest they've got more of the stricken plants on fire more explosions more
[03:08:43.320 --> 03:08:47.160]  radioactive steam rising the japanese government now being a little more truthful saying the
[03:08:47.160 --> 03:08:52.920]  radiation is so high we may even pull out emergency workers abc news reported that this morning as well
[03:08:52.920 --> 03:08:59.160]  as the kiyoto news uh so we told you friday when when a tsunami and earthquakes hit and they don't
[03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:05.080]  have power to plants you're going to have a problem then when one blew up saturday i said fall out
[03:09:05.080 --> 03:09:09.720]  the media said no there's no problem nothing's been in the in the internal containment facility
[03:09:09.720 --> 03:09:14.760]  breach now they admit that did happen then on monday fukushima three mark one plutonium based
[03:09:14.760 --> 03:09:19.240]  plant blue sky high on a giant mushroom cloud now we learn on top of all of them they were storing
[03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:25.480]  hundreds of thousands i can't believe this number over 600 000 rods we don't know how many got blown
[03:09:25.480 --> 03:09:31.080]  but we know that they've had hundreds of thousands stored above the mark one into the sky everything
[03:09:31.080 --> 03:09:36.360]  they touch then becomes radioactive sure they're heavy their particles may not float across but
[03:09:36.360 --> 03:09:41.400]  they're going into the ocean but they touch other things and makes them radioactive uh and our media
[03:09:41.400 --> 03:09:48.760]  saying hey ncaa uh obama spent an hour and a half this morning with his picks national press conferences
[03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:53.000]  tell and he said this is a nice diversion from what's happening as if it's good to be diverted
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:56.600]  the pentagon knows what's going on with the radiation they've got aircraft there they're
[03:09:56.600 --> 03:10:00.920]  telling the public oh we might send an aircraft tomorrow to do some test they don't want you to
[03:10:00.920 --> 03:10:06.760]  know the japanese government is not releasing the radiation detection information in the two states
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:12.520]  or prefects as they're known prefectures as they're known in the middle of fukushima we put that map
[03:10:12.520 --> 03:10:17.080]  back on screen they say still gathering data they have it everywhere else in high levels of radiation
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:21.640]  but there we're not going to not release that right now i don't want to create a panic the winds are
[03:10:21.640 --> 03:10:27.880]  blowing right at us that's the big uh issue my friends and here's the article obama fiddles
[03:10:27.880 --> 03:10:34.440]  while fukushima burns that's prisonplanet.com info wars dot com obama plays uh while japan
[03:10:34.440 --> 03:10:39.240]  begs for help uh mike adams again what do you make of that before we go back to calls well the whole
[03:10:39.240 --> 03:10:46.120]  situation really demonstrates how fragile our entire civilization has become so many interdependencies
[03:10:46.120 --> 03:10:51.480]  for example the nuclear power plants there in in japan they were dependent on the power grid to run
[03:10:51.480 --> 03:10:56.440]  the generators once the power failed and the generators were required to circulate the coolant
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:11:01.000]  that would keep the rods cool and those failed because of the tsunami these interdependencies
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:09.320]  extend to the food supply to food sources to the soils the farming soils to just every area of life
[03:11:09.320 --> 03:11:16.120]  medicine even education even how we raise our children or have babies it's all interlinked
[03:11:16.120 --> 03:11:20.280]  and that's one thing that this this crisis has to get us thinking about how are we going to eat
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:25.640]  food if it's irradiated uh how are the japanese people going to survive if they can't use a huge
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:29.400]  portion of their country for the next 10 cents and anytime people come up with reasonable
[03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:34.600]  sustainable ideas that are local the feds block it just like all over the world not just here in the
[03:11:34.600 --> 03:11:40.520]  u.s federal government central governments will give you a tax incentive to put solar in but only
[03:11:40.520 --> 03:11:44.360]  hook it into the larger grid that's right and then they won't come out and give you an inspection
[03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:50.120]  most of the time if it's your own solar so it's all about keeping us dependent they're not really
[03:11:50.120 --> 03:11:54.280]  supporting independent living or independent thinking for that the only way to have a clean
[03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:59.480]  out the safe society is that you run it yourself locally and you can watch it and you're in control
[03:11:59.480 --> 03:12:04.520]  anything big and centralized always deteriorates because those on top can't run it don't want to
[03:12:04.520 --> 03:12:09.720]  run it get greedy get delusional that's absolutely right this is why freedom is the answer really
[03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:16.360]  if you get down to it local control local freedom and by control i mean that the locals are controlling
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:20.920]  their own communities and towns and then food supply and so on local food security local barter
[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:26.840]  in exchange using honest money systems local medicine where doctors can actually make their own
[03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:31.800]  decisions without being thrown in jail by the feds freedom is the answer freedom is always the answer
[03:12:31.800 --> 03:12:36.360]  on this issue as well as just about every other issue that that we talk about or that you talk
[03:12:36.360 --> 03:12:41.080]  about on your show freedom is the same thing for internet freedom open source locally controlled
[03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:46.200]  not centralized by homeland security exactly the diversity of information on the internet creates
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:50.680]  safety because it gives people more options of where they can get information if we didn't have an
[03:12:50.680 --> 03:12:54.760]  internet they'd be telling us no one was hurt and there was no radiation right think about it if
[03:12:54.760 --> 03:13:00.360]  if this were 1985 and we didn't have the internet this would be a completely different story people
[03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:04.200]  wouldn't be able to listen to you as much as they do now people wouldn't be getting information from
[03:13:04.200 --> 03:13:08.120]  me or others out there who are writing about this and they wouldn't be getting the whole story
[03:13:08.120 --> 03:13:13.720]  they'd be getting the government version which is sterilized and watered down and engineered to
[03:13:13.720 --> 03:13:20.840]  create a a specific spin message with a design with it with an intention that people won't panic
[03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:25.480]  and won't pay attention and won't stress the supply lines by getting prepared for example
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:29.080]  we're going to talk more about that and you know what let's just take you all the way in the yard
[03:13:29.080 --> 03:13:34.920]  is your wife cool with that i think so yeah she needs some food or something no you always bring

[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:41.800]  then because there's too much to cover we'll go over this other news with you too let's go to
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:48.680]  Matthew in Illinois Matthew you're on the air uh hi Alex um big time listener um love your show
[03:13:48.680 --> 03:13:54.360]  just want to let you know um i have a couple questions if you don't mind me sure launch them um
[03:13:55.160 --> 03:14:00.120]  well i'm a 21 year old kid uh college student so i'm not a kid you're a man they teach you
[03:14:00.120 --> 03:14:08.440]  you're a kid till you're 30 now really um but well i'm still young um but i was i just want to know
[03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:14.760]  as far as this whole crisis is going um i watched the video that you provided uh follow America and
[03:14:14.760 --> 03:14:20.360]  it was a real real eye opener to me and i guess what i want to know is because he said that you
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:25.320]  know you have to subscribe to it i want to know do you think if this is or anybody else worth
[03:14:25.320 --> 03:14:32.840]  investing into his um his uh tips that he had like silver invest in the gold bible the silver
[03:14:32.840 --> 03:14:38.680]  secret well listen uh standsbury research has a great track record of of of predictions and analysis
[03:14:38.680 --> 03:14:42.440]  that's a sponsor end of america three dot com but i wouldn't have taken the sponsor
[03:14:42.440 --> 03:14:46.440]  if i didn't overwhelmingly you know agree with their analysis it doesn't mean i've read all
[03:14:46.440 --> 03:14:51.560]  their thousands of newsletters and agree with every single pick that his 20 plus researchers come out
[03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:57.080]  with uh you make your own decisions more information is better uh but but that's my bottom line there
[03:14:57.080 --> 03:15:04.520]  okay all right i was just i just wanted to get your personal opinion on that um and also um
[03:15:04.520 --> 03:15:09.880]  as far as like work this potassium iodide i just want to know where i can get in what else
[03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:14.680]  might mean my family can do to take steps to all right thank you matthew yeah the the the
[03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:19.240]  medical grade potassium iodine is pretty much sold out everywhere uh and then people say well
[03:15:19.240 --> 03:15:24.680]  if you take the natural drops from kelp or barley or or or dulce or alfalfa that isn't
[03:15:24.680 --> 03:15:28.280]  going to protect you but from my research sure you've got the mega dose which can actually
[03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:32.760]  make you sick and i'm not giving medical advice or figure it out for yourself but for me personally
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:37.080]  if you just take a little more than the regular allowance of it that also
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:15:41.080]  fills it so it doesn't absorb as much it's just the medical grade kind of over kills
[03:15:41.080 --> 03:15:45.080]  mike adams you've studied this in depth well this gets to the issue of these ongoing nutritional
[03:15:45.080 --> 03:15:50.280]  deficiencies that are always impacting america and other nations if people weren't so deficient
[03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:55.160]  in iodine like they are in vitamin d and magnesium and other nutrients then this wouldn't be such a
[03:15:55.160 --> 03:15:59.480]  big issue because you would already have more iodine in your thyroid and by the way iodine
[03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:04.360]  is is transported in your body to specific tissues breast tissues and prostate tissues in
[03:16:04.360 --> 03:16:10.360]  addition to your thyroid and that's why this radiation and if radioactive iodine is carried
[03:16:10.360 --> 03:16:15.080]  through dust and through wind into america and if people come into contact with it you're going to
[03:16:15.080 --> 03:16:20.440]  see increased rates of breast cancer and prostate cancer and i don't see the main the u.s. government
[03:16:20.440 --> 03:16:25.320]  detonated we learned over 300 other countries around 200 so it's 500 plus why do you think
[03:16:25.320 --> 03:16:31.000]  since the 50s cancer went way up i mean it's no brainer it's certainly one of the reasons i mean
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:35.080]  obviously it's hormones in the middle it's a cocktail right there's so there's so much contamination
[03:16:35.080 --> 03:16:39.960]  right now even before this incident in in japan now this could make it worse but if people had
[03:16:39.960 --> 03:16:45.240]  better nutrition from the get go you know more iodine more trace minerals more fresh produce
[03:16:45.240 --> 03:16:49.080]  in their diets to begin with and i'm not saying you can't eat meat or you can't do this and then
[03:16:49.080 --> 03:16:54.600]  i'm just saying get more superfood nutrition i mean having regular iodine to a great extent
[03:16:54.600 --> 03:17:00.360]  will already protect you not the superdust that's exactly right and and by the way there are many
[03:17:00.360 --> 03:17:04.840]  cooked foods there are there are many sources of healthy free-range meat for example that can
[03:17:04.840 --> 03:17:10.600]  actually provide some listed listed so what i mean what's good in terms of getting iodine give us
[03:17:10.600 --> 03:17:17.160]  a cocktail of things that have good natural iodine well the seaweeds dulce is very is very high in
[03:17:17.160 --> 03:17:23.160]  kombu is very high i don't know if i'm pronouncing these in the why is alfalfa listed uh alfalfa is
[03:17:23.160 --> 03:17:27.960]  is a type of plant that takes in a lot of trace minerals from the soil just like grasses if you
[03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:33.000]  juice wheatgrass for example if that wheatgrass is grown in soil that's high in iodine then you'll
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:38.360]  get the iodine in the wheatgrass juice but if you grow your wheatgrass in soil that lacks iodine
[03:17:38.360 --> 03:17:43.480]  because it's been over farmed or you know agriculturally abused then you won't get the iodine or
[03:17:43.480 --> 03:17:48.920]  the magnesium or the selenium or these other trace minerals that your body needs and a lot of this
[03:17:48.920 --> 03:17:54.120]  will come down to nutrition if we get exposed in north america so there are many things that can
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:59.960]  help protect against cancer iodine is is not it's not like sunscreen versus a nuke it's not
[03:17:59.960 --> 03:18:04.360]  going to stop cancer through your whole body it only really protects your glandular system
[03:18:04.360 --> 03:18:08.440]  there are other systems that can be affected and that can get cancer what are some of the
[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:11.960]  other things we had a pharmacist on him saying the same thing what are some of the things that
[03:18:11.960 --> 03:18:16.360]  protect other systems well selenium is a trace mineral that protects against cancers very well
[03:18:16.360 --> 03:18:22.520]  known for that zinc has an anti-cancer effect omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin d there's research
[03:18:22.520 --> 03:18:27.640]  out there that shows that vitamin d can help prevent four out of five cancers of all types
[03:18:27.640 --> 03:18:33.480]  colon cancer leukemia brain tumors you name it and and virtually all americans virtually everyone
[03:18:34.040 --> 03:18:39.000]  is deficient in vitamin d in the u.s. government set the levels artificially low let's jam in one
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:45.960]  more call kent uh in ohio go ahead you're on the air hi this is kent from Cincinnati hey buddy i have
[03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:51.000]  a hey i i've got a degree from pretty university applied physics specializing in scientific
[03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:55.800]  programming and nuclear engineering but it's only a bachelor's degree so i don't know as much about
[03:18:55.800 --> 03:18:59.880]  this topic as you know phd or something with you know what to say about a little bit of knowledge
[03:18:59.880 --> 03:19:06.200]  being dangerous and i i know that metals hold radioactivity fairly well and we all know that
[03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:11.640]  breathing aluminum from chemtrails is bad if breathing aluminum is bad how about breathing
[03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:16.120]  radioactive aluminum from the chemtrails what do you think about this radioactive stuff coming
[03:19:16.120 --> 03:19:21.960]  over to california contaminating the chemtrails well there's all sorts of weather modification
[03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:27.960]  going on so it sounds like that would actually add to it um mike adams well clearly uh i'm not a
[03:19:27.960 --> 03:19:34.840]  physicist either so i don't know what is the the the how well aluminum picks up radiation and then
[03:19:34.840 --> 03:19:39.480]  emits it however your colors has a good point the radiation is going to affect many systems
[03:19:39.480 --> 03:19:42.520]  what's in the atmosphere what's in the food what's in the water what's in the seafood
[03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:50.440]  can't it can't anything else uh yeah just one quick thing uh paul latin is a great writer that
[03:19:50.440 --> 03:19:55.800]  article that he did at the last minute yesterday terrific yeah the one breaking down the uh 60
[03:19:55.800 --> 03:20:04.200]  thousand fuel rods uh more than that 600 000 blown sky high alex has told you that the mid east
[03:20:04.200 --> 03:20:09.800]  uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing
[03:20:09.800 --> 03:20:14.920]  the impact right here in the united states ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel
[03:20:14.920 --> 03:20:21.080]  prices hit a 30 month high in february and pump prices are expected to reach five dollars a gallon
[03:20:21.080 --> 03:20:25.880]  because of shipping costs food is being priced out of the reach of millions of americans with
[03:20:25.880 --> 03:20:31.560]  an expected 35 jump in the next 60 days move quickly while you could still afford it and

[03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:16.520]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i've turned members influence
[03:21:16.520 --> 03:21:22.440]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all
[03:21:22.440 --> 03:21:28.920]  of us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[03:21:28.920 --> 03:21:34.920]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[03:21:34.920 --> 03:21:40.280]  world government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[03:21:40.280 --> 03:21:45.000]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[03:22:00.600 --> 03:22:03.560]  have you ever felt like the united states government knows way too much about your
[03:22:03.560 --> 03:22:08.520]  financial affairs i continue to hear stories about property seizures frozen bank accounts
[03:22:08.520 --> 03:22:13.320]  confiscation of stocks and bonds it makes me wonder if the u.s. citizen will ever again have the

[03:23:15.320 --> 03:23:22.360]  because of obama's illegal socialization of america republicans democrats and independents
[03:23:22.360 --> 03:23:30.360]  answered the questionnaire as well as private citizens 6.1 million said texas would be better

[03:24:19.400 --> 03:24:25.240]  and other points that mike adams is here to cover you know we know about the nukes and how they're
[03:24:25.240 --> 03:24:29.480]  lying about that they've been caught now red-handed that's confirmed whitewashing this our own government
[03:24:29.480 --> 03:24:34.600]  doing it now we know they're lying and whitewashing the extent is not known but what else is going on
[03:24:34.600 --> 03:24:38.840]  and i've got a big news blitz coming up with mike adams and then we'll take whoever's left
[03:24:38.840 --> 03:24:43.240]  call wise from this board of callers we can't take any more after this so zack tim jeremy
[03:24:43.240 --> 03:24:48.120]  david josh let's stop at those will end the overdrive at the end of this hour i will before
[03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:52.920]  we end also give you the latest and big developments that are unfolding you can obviously track what's
[03:24:52.920 --> 03:24:58.040]  happening at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com you can also go to mike adams excellent
[03:24:58.040 --> 03:25:04.040]  group of sites natural news dot com chief among them okay uh let's go to zack in texas than tim
[03:25:04.040 --> 03:25:11.560]  in deutschland uh zack you're on the air worldwide ox jones my hero what's up i got a question for
[03:25:12.440 --> 03:25:20.600]  the health ranger yes i got these uh i order all tablets or 50 milligrams which has i guess 30
[03:25:20.600 --> 03:25:29.640]  milligrams of the uh potassium iodide and 20 of just elemental iodine uh how like we started
[03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:34.120]  taking them i guess i'm not going to give you medical advice but let me see if i'm right uh i would
[03:25:34.120 --> 03:25:38.120]  personally then you need about 130 milligrams of that they say with the medical great stuff
[03:25:38.120 --> 03:25:42.120]  but it but it can't make you feel bad because it over fills it you would take three of those a day
[03:25:42.120 --> 03:25:46.120]  for about a week to fully fill up i'm not giving medical advice that's what the inserts on other
[03:25:46.120 --> 03:25:49.800]  ones say what would you say well first of all i would say you don't need to take any right now
[03:25:49.800 --> 03:25:54.280]  because there's no radiation in north america from this incident i would wait and and take a
[03:25:54.280 --> 03:25:59.240]  precautionary approach that we know that we know of right now but i there are a lot of people out
[03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:04.280]  there with geiger counters and you know even in california and oregon i mean i own a geiger counter
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:07.640]  you know i because i've been prepared for a long long time and probably you do too
[03:26:07.640 --> 03:26:10.920]  so if if people start getting readings on those you can bet they're going to call in and you
[03:26:10.920 --> 03:26:15.640]  and i are going to hear about it and that's the time where if you're if you're in the path of that
[03:26:15.640 --> 03:26:20.440]  you need to start really dozing up now i know you got to have iodine before the radiation exposure
[03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:25.560]  at some level so take the natural uh nutrient supplement time that's what i would do that's
[03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:30.040]  what i'm doing i'm eating a lot of seaweed right now i'm eating a dried sea kelp for example
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:35.320]  i i take a lot of seaweed as just a regular part of my diet though in any case and i encourage
[03:26:35.320 --> 03:26:38.680]  other people to do that because it has many other benefits too there's so many health benefits to
[03:26:38.680 --> 03:26:44.680]  eating seaweed and micro micro algae such as that would be dulcer kelp dulce kelp nori you can just
[03:26:44.680 --> 03:26:49.720]  go to a sushi restaurant you know and just eat sushi with the the seaweed wrap on it and that's
[03:26:49.720 --> 03:26:55.960]  very high in iodine now the the iodine pills are extremely high and because there is a risk of
[03:26:55.960 --> 03:27:01.320]  side effects i don't want people to to potentially be overdosing on them right now out of out of a
[03:27:01.320 --> 03:27:09.480]  fear of something that hasn't really headed our way yet it may but right now uh i would say
[03:27:09.480 --> 03:27:13.080]  let's just take a look at the situation here in north america it's different if you're in japan
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:17.880]  of course that's that's you know code red emergency but in north america right now i would say wait and
[03:27:17.880 --> 03:27:21.720]  see and hold on your pills you may need more of them later all right hope that answers your
[03:27:21.720 --> 03:27:31.640]  questions zack tim in germany you're on the air hello yes sir yes sorry there was background noise
[03:27:31.640 --> 03:27:38.520]  yeah um i still think we are worrying um still too much or we're giving up too early about the
[03:27:38.520 --> 03:27:43.000]  response we are complaining too much about the corruption and planning what pills we're gonna
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:49.640]  take i think we still need to force them um harder or push them harder on on on what they do on the
[03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:56.440]  on the reactors i know but they i mean they got 50 people working in there on a suicide mission
[03:27:56.440 --> 03:28:01.080]  abc news reports that the japanese may even pull them out so i don't think we're being defeatist
[03:28:01.080 --> 03:28:06.120]  we were being honest about how bad the crisis was on friday saturday and being criticized for it now
[03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:14.040]  we've been proven correct right there's there's one plug i want to make um for web page it's j l t t
[03:28:14.040 --> 03:28:20.120]  dot de there's a single page article on there i think the japanese still have a couple of options
[03:28:20.120 --> 03:28:25.400]  they failed badly with the helicopters now because they started it way too late but i think they should
[03:28:25.400 --> 03:28:31.320]  use um they're produced one thing that's still or one of the few things that is still produced in
[03:28:31.320 --> 03:28:38.280]  america is good fire extinguishing equipment and there's some strong uh industrial grade fire
[03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:46.360]  extinguishing um gears and they can pump like 6 000 gallons a minute and i think they should really
[03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:51.320]  mount them on the on the well yeah where's the u.s military they're swarming that area with
[03:28:51.320 --> 03:28:57.480]  firefighting equipment they but the the radiation is so high sir that they've pulled out so so i
[03:28:57.480 --> 03:29:01.720]  thought our military is there to fight and die to protect us and you sign on to this we'll get
[03:29:01.720 --> 03:29:07.480]  in there warriors be like the japanese go go go let's see it what do you think of that statement

[03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:31.240]  on the situation in fukushima obviously more fires more explosions more smoke
[03:33:31.240 --> 03:33:37.080]  um i mean you can't get much worse than the fukushima one and three blowing up when they
[03:33:37.080 --> 03:33:41.240]  stored the old reactor rods on top of the buildings and i mean they're just all over the place
[03:33:41.960 --> 03:33:48.520]  it's unspeakable uh and the media hides it in plain view this is going on but uh you know really
[03:33:48.520 --> 03:33:52.680]  doesn't have people focus in on it but here's the article that we need to get out to everybody
[03:33:52.680 --> 03:33:59.320]  info wars dot com prison planet dot com fukushima alert fukushima cover up 40 years of spent nuclear
[03:33:59.320 --> 03:34:05.480]  rods blown sky high and you can count on government to cover this up unless you demand the truth and
[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:10.520]  you demand the military be out there testing it flying over the aircraft not oh we're gonna
[03:34:10.520 --> 03:34:14.760]  send one to mara six days into it you better believe they're all over it that's why when
[03:34:14.760 --> 03:34:20.520]  fukushima three blew up the biggin the plutonium base reactor on monday morning the fleet just
[03:34:20.520 --> 03:34:25.320]  hauled out of their 200 miles down south just as fast as they could because some of their ships
[03:34:25.320 --> 03:34:29.880]  got radiated uh and we're going to put something on screen for present planet dot tv viewers i i
[03:34:29.880 --> 03:34:35.640]  did say give that to curtain watson i want them to post a blurb with this live map out of japan
[03:34:35.640 --> 03:34:40.920]  feeding the numbers the government's putting out if you look there uh that that that that state or or
[03:34:41.960 --> 03:34:47.880]  pre factory uh there in the middle is where fukushima is based uh in fact we've got it blown
[03:34:47.880 --> 03:34:51.720]  up so much you can't see that it says fukushima over on the side but that's fukushima where the
[03:34:51.720 --> 03:35:00.520]  cursor is and you notice that they're saying they're having 87 to 900 plus uh readings of high
[03:35:00.520 --> 03:35:05.960]  radiation around tokyo that's where the wind turned yesterday and blew it south uh but you notice in
[03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:12.120]  the area right around in the two states uh the region's uh local governments right around fukushima
[03:35:12.120 --> 03:35:17.320]  a huge area they're saying under survey they're not giving the numbers out and that's also in the
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:22.280]  japanese news mike adams what do you think's going on there well well clearly they're just not
[03:35:22.280 --> 03:35:26.200]  sharing the information they don't want people to know how bad it is that's been the case almost
[03:35:26.200 --> 03:35:30.280]  from the start on this because they don't want people to panic you know obama's trying to distract
[03:35:30.280 --> 03:35:35.720]  americans from the story the japanese government's trying to say don't worry be happy and the fact is
[03:35:35.720 --> 03:35:40.360]  this this is an explosive situation literally and figuratively have you ever seen how a mockingbird
[03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:46.280]  if it's got a nest out in your bush will fly and act like its wings hurt and stuff if you get near
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:49.960]  the uh yeah if you get near their nest you can tell where their nest is at because they'll get on the
[03:35:49.960 --> 03:35:56.040]  ground and act like they're hurt right they'll dive bomb you obama's going look ncaa will sports
[03:35:56.040 --> 03:36:00.600]  meet with the hockey team and he admitted this is a distraction and he's walking around with a broken
[03:36:00.600 --> 03:36:05.320]  wing i mean it's disgusting well but they're not going to be able to succeed at covering this up
[03:36:05.320 --> 03:36:10.120]  this story won't go away especially if people start getting radio activity out of the out of their
[03:36:10.120 --> 03:36:15.480]  food but march madness well madness is the right word for it i don't know about march because
[03:36:15.480 --> 03:36:19.480]  this is going to continue all year long and and probably through 2012 as well we're going to
[03:36:19.480 --> 03:36:23.800]  have to rethink the entire nuclear future of our planet mainline news is saying this could go on for
[03:36:23.800 --> 03:36:29.560]  much absolutely cooking and melting and steaming and exploding i mean everybody's getting a lesson
[03:36:29.560 --> 03:36:34.200]  in nuclear physics this week but on on the fuel rods they don't cool down just by throwing a little
[03:36:34.200 --> 03:36:38.920]  seawater on them these things continue to generate heat for a very long period of time and you have
[03:36:38.920 --> 03:36:43.720]  to pump coolant coolant through them for a long period of time otherwise i mean we're talking weeks
[03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:48.760]  and the plant looks like godzilla went to town on it i mean how are they going to fix any of that
[03:36:48.760 --> 03:36:53.000]  well they're not i mean they they admitted today that they pulled the workers out it's too dangerous
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:57.640]  for the workers that is throwing in the towel alex that's a surrender that's a that's a pretty
[03:36:57.640 --> 03:37:01.960]  Chernobyl type of moment i don't know how they expect to be able to get back in there now is the
[03:37:01.960 --> 03:37:07.800]  radiation going to magically go down on its own no it doesn't work that way it's going to get worse
[03:37:07.800 --> 03:37:12.440]  yeah it's got billions of years of half-life depending on what isotope and you're fighting
[03:37:12.440 --> 03:37:15.960]  laws of physics and when you fight the laws of physics just like when you fight the laws of
[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:22.280]  economics you eventually lose as a society or as a civilization this civilization has got to wake
[03:37:22.280 --> 03:37:26.840]  up it's got to mature it's got to learn some very difficult lessons there's going to be a lot of
[03:37:26.840 --> 03:37:31.160]  loss of life unfortunately it's already happened there's going to be more but our civilization
[03:37:31.160 --> 03:37:37.240]  on this planet has got to wake up and grow up and start to get real about what we're the decisions
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:42.600]  we're making and what we're talking about i mean like your show needs to be listened to by everybody
[03:37:42.600 --> 03:37:47.560]  who's out there just watching you know daytime tv and and sports and all that i don't know it may
[03:37:47.560 --> 03:37:53.400]  not be as important as march madness well i didn't even know march madness was on until you told me
[03:37:53.400 --> 03:37:57.240]  about it when i came in here today that's how disconnected i am from the sports scene and how
[03:37:57.240 --> 03:38:01.480]  focused i am you're some kind of weirdo i know that's why i've been told that from time to time for
[03:38:01.480 --> 03:38:07.320]  some reason i mean you come in here with baby formula that's over half corn syrup yes and uh it
[03:38:07.320 --> 03:38:11.640]  totally hurt you know it's not good for the children the study show who cares about babies march madness
[03:38:11.640 --> 03:38:16.360]  man i'm going to bring more demo products for you next time too some some crazy stuff that i found
[03:38:16.360 --> 03:38:21.160]  out there like the blueberry cereal that doesn't have blueberries in it i'll bring a box for you
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:25.320]  it's i i don't mean to get off top no no no next time you're in i'll have you back in next week
[03:38:25.320 --> 03:38:28.200]  since i heard you're gonna be back in town let's have you come in here and like go over some of
[03:38:28.200 --> 03:38:32.120]  those products show and tell yeah and you know if this situation gets worse in japan we could be
[03:38:32.120 --> 03:38:38.120]  bringing in well maybe i don't want to bring it in but radioactive food how about how about proof
[03:38:38.120 --> 03:38:42.840]  that the food is radioactive and that we bring in tomatoes with a geiger counter yeah well you know
[03:38:42.840 --> 03:38:47.000]  gmo's and radioactive i mean imagine that i don't mean to make well next they'll do remember china
[03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:51.080]  last two years ago when the melamine was coming out of the u.s the epa came out and the fda came
[03:38:51.080 --> 03:38:57.160]  out and said you know what melamine isn't bad for kids now well you know we've got reports of china
[03:38:57.160 --> 03:39:01.720]  in china they're making rice out of plastic it's not just the melamine you know it's the it's the
[03:39:01.720 --> 03:39:07.320]  plastic in the food now too the stuff that's being grown in the u.s thanks to the the gmo seed
[03:39:07.320 --> 03:39:12.920]  companies is in my opinion just another catastrophe that's because there's so much toxic waste and
[03:39:12.920 --> 03:39:16.520]  stuff they can't get rid of they put it back in the food to go down the sewage system now i'm
[03:39:16.520 --> 03:39:21.960]  going to stop and give you the floor for the next 10 minutes before i go through a blitz of news that
[03:39:21.960 --> 03:39:27.160]  i've got here uh not just dealing with this whole reactor situation that's become a distraction to
[03:39:27.160 --> 03:39:30.920]  a certain extent but we must cover it uh from the other things that are happening the gun grabbing
[03:39:30.920 --> 03:39:37.080]  the economy meltdown but but go over some of the other things that uh this nuclear disaster reveals
[03:39:37.080 --> 03:39:41.720]  the other things they're covering up well it reveals this pattern of covering things up and
[03:39:41.720 --> 03:39:47.800]  this pattern extends into so many areas we already talked about the gmo's fluoride now is coming to
[03:39:47.800 --> 03:39:53.240]  the surface where this big push to fluoridate the municipal water supplies around the world is now
[03:39:53.240 --> 03:40:00.680]  being revealed as really just a chemical poisoning effort and the science is inarguable on this the
[03:40:00.680 --> 03:40:05.320]  fluoride is going to have to stop the poisoning the mass poisoning of our planet and of our of
[03:40:05.320 --> 03:40:10.840]  our people is going to have to stop and i believe alex that this event this nuclear event is going
[03:40:10.840 --> 03:40:15.880]  to wake people up and to start looking at these patterns i mean why why do we have daytime talk
[03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:21.960]  shows that are focused on i don't know uh peoples people's relationships but they're not talking
[03:40:21.960 --> 03:40:26.600]  about what families really need to know like do you have some extra food stored away do you have
[03:40:26.600 --> 03:40:30.680]  a water filter well they try to sell things that aren't families to break everybody up well sorry
[03:40:30.680 --> 03:40:36.280]  go ahead yeah no you're right you're right but we are we are distracted as a planet as a global
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:41.560]  civilization we've been distracted and pushed in the wrong directions on so many issues that people
[03:40:41.560 --> 03:40:46.520]  have lost sight of what's really important and i got to say this alex in america today because
[03:40:46.520 --> 03:40:51.560]  we've been so abundant and and things have come to us so relatively easily over the last hundred
[03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:57.320]  years many of us have become complacent we we've gotten to the point where where we believe that
[03:40:57.320 --> 03:41:01.560]  things should come to us easily and we're not willing to do the preparedness and do the hard
[03:41:01.560 --> 03:41:06.520]  work and and put in the effort that it takes to grow your own food for example oh let's face it a
[03:41:06.520 --> 03:41:13.160]  lot of americans especially young people you you you uh see they think breathing is almost work
[03:41:13.160 --> 03:41:18.840]  they think anything is how dare you ask me to do something they just they just are entitled well
[03:41:18.840 --> 03:41:23.240]  it is this entitlement mentality and i know i'm going to get some hate mail for this for
[03:41:23.240 --> 03:41:28.440]  bringing up wisconsin again but there i think we saw a lot of people who who were already well
[03:41:28.440 --> 03:41:34.520]  paid by the state but who who still had an entitlement mentality like the state owes us more
[03:41:34.520 --> 03:41:40.680]  more than the average person is making more benefits more pay for doing essentially less
[03:41:40.680 --> 03:41:46.200]  than a lot of people are doing on their own i mean i i i work 16 hour days i know you do too
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:51.000]  many of us out there who are are sort of making our own living small businesses people are working
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:56.040]  12 hours 14 hours 16 hour days and they have to pay for their own health care if they want any i
[03:41:56.040 --> 03:42:01.560]  don't even buy health care because i don't even want to support that whole system so we are working
[03:42:01.560 --> 03:42:07.960]  and we we are trying to bring back this idea that is that i see here in texas by the way because
[03:42:07.960 --> 03:42:14.680]  i've been talking to a lot of farmers here this idea that working is is honest and it's rewarding
[03:42:14.680 --> 03:42:20.360]  and that's the only way to create wealth and abundance and self-reliance in our system these
[03:42:20.360 --> 03:42:24.840]  farmers are out there i've been talking to farmers and they're not afraid of work alex they're not
[03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:30.440]  afraid to go out there and put in a 16 hour day hard work hard labor work but if you go into a lot
[03:42:30.440 --> 03:42:34.760]  of cities a lot of people i don't mean to characterize everybody like this is not everybody but you
[03:42:34.760 --> 03:42:39.800]  see a lot of people who are afraid to put in the hard work to get the results that they want
[03:42:39.800 --> 03:42:45.080]  and because of that entitlement mentality and because of that complacency that lack of preparedness
[03:42:45.080 --> 03:42:51.000]  we now have a nation i think we have a world where people are not ready for what's coming and what's
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:55.480]  coming you know this nuclear incident is just the beginning i believe it's just the tip of the iceberg
[03:42:55.480 --> 03:43:01.400]  we've got a financial tsunami coming to use that to use that metaphor we've got a health
[03:43:01.400 --> 03:43:06.360]  tsunami we've got pharmaceutical contamination of our waterways of our oceans of our world
[03:43:06.360 --> 03:43:10.360]  we've got the vaccine issue we've got bill gates out there talking about people who don't vaccinate
[03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:16.040]  their children or baby killers i mean come on the issues are outrageous and it's time that we
[03:43:16.040 --> 03:43:20.040]  that we finally stood up and started having some honest talk about what's really going on out there
[03:43:20.040 --> 03:43:27.400]  alex is i mean where do you want me to go with this uh i'm just i'm trying to get the emphasis
[03:43:27.400 --> 03:43:30.520]  to the to the people out there about how much we got to wake up but i don't know where you want
[03:43:30.520 --> 03:43:34.440]  me to focus i don't want to get too far off track no i mean it just shows how when we live in the
[03:43:34.440 --> 03:43:40.600]  dial and think everything's a joke reactors blow up yeah wars get started uh you know i know a lot
[03:43:40.600 --> 03:43:46.520]  of great people in our military it's the leadership that's bad but you know dropping hellfire missiles
[03:43:46.520 --> 03:43:51.720]  on people who you don't even know their name in afghanistan that's manly but where where are the
[03:43:51.720 --> 03:43:56.520]  militaries in there with the reactor they're sending the police and the plant workers in
[03:43:56.520 --> 03:44:00.520]  to the death sentence and then that means more people are going to die around them
[03:44:00.520 --> 03:44:05.800]  and more people are going to get radiated because the warrior bees are not doing their job well
[03:44:05.800 --> 03:44:12.440]  that brings up a good point most people i think miscalculate risk and for example the whole war
[03:44:12.440 --> 03:44:16.440]  on terrorism there's a lot of money and a lot of effort going in that direction but if you look at
[03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:21.720]  the numbers the u.s food and drug administration is killing far more americans through its actions
[03:44:21.720 --> 03:44:25.880]  and its inaction uh for example not pulling dangerous drugs off the market what's the
[03:44:25.880 --> 03:44:30.600]  number of admitted bad drug interactions or drug side effects that kills hundreds of thousands
[03:44:30.600 --> 03:44:35.880]  a year well it's anywhere from a hundred thousand to about 240 thousand a year according depending
[03:44:35.880 --> 03:44:41.240]  on who you believe whose numbers you believe but those are those are deaths caused by fda approved
[03:44:41.240 --> 03:44:47.800]  pharmaceuticals approved by the government used according to the according to the label
[03:44:47.800 --> 03:44:53.160]  used as directed those are deaths that dwarf the number of deaths that have been associated with
[03:44:53.160 --> 03:44:58.840]  terrorism even if you believe the government's explanation of 9 11 and so on so you have to
[03:44:58.840 --> 03:45:04.920]  really look at where are the threats to our lives to our health to our families and to our freedoms
[03:45:04.920 --> 03:45:12.040]  and those threats that are very real are not the areas that our government is telling us to focus on
[03:45:12.040 --> 03:45:16.440]  they're telling us to focus on march madness now i've just learned that today here they're telling
[03:45:16.440 --> 03:45:22.120]  us to focus on on terrorism this this this mystical idea and they give us fear stories
[03:45:22.120 --> 03:45:26.840]  from time to time they're telling us to focus on on these these bombers that the fbi is even
[03:45:26.840 --> 03:45:31.400]  coordinating with you know you've you've talked about this a lot but they're not telling us to
[03:45:31.400 --> 03:45:37.720]  focus on uh shoring up your financial preparedness situation or shoring up your emergency medicine
[03:45:37.720 --> 03:45:44.440]  supply in your own home or teaching your kids the value of hard work or or getting more vitamin
[03:45:44.440 --> 03:45:49.560]  d into your body or or eating better growing some of your own food having some food security
[03:45:49.560 --> 03:45:53.800]  knowing your neighbors knowing your local community members having more local community
[03:45:54.520 --> 03:45:59.880]  power instead of centralized washington power telling you what to do every single day we have
[03:45:59.880 --> 03:46:04.040]  a nation now that has become so dependent on washington that people have forgotten how to
[03:46:04.040 --> 03:46:09.240]  live their own lives they've forgotten that rugged individualism that made america great
[03:46:09.240 --> 03:46:13.880]  and i'm afraid i i actually fear about i don't i'm not trying to spread fear on this alex but i
[03:46:13.880 --> 03:46:22.440]  i'm concerned that america is at risk of losing what made it great which is that individualism that
[03:46:22.440 --> 03:46:28.200]  that uh ability to go out and do hard work and and be creative and get results and work together
[03:46:28.200 --> 03:46:32.200]  and if we had that kind of creativity right now i think we could solve this nuclear
[03:46:32.200 --> 03:46:37.720]  issue in japan why isn't the u.s military in there right now helping japan solve because it's
[03:46:37.720 --> 03:46:43.800]  dangerous military they don't have a drone to fix it right right they need a drone a remote
[03:46:43.800 --> 03:46:47.720]  controlled pilot to go in there and fix it come on you know lives are at stake the planet's at
[03:46:47.720 --> 03:46:52.600]  stake right now this we are talking about the future of human civilization on our planet
[03:46:52.600 --> 03:46:59.320]  i mean civilization get in there military listen i went and saw uh the movie um the battle of la
[03:46:59.320 --> 03:47:03.080]  and the whole thing was a marine corab the little kid going here my little marine and
[03:47:03.080 --> 03:47:07.080]  joined the marines i was pentagon the whole thing because they couldn't sell joining the military
[03:47:07.080 --> 03:47:10.840]  to kill brown people anymore so now it's killing aliens but the whole thing was department of
[03:47:10.840 --> 03:47:14.280]  defense brainwashing and you know they don't care about the troops they're taking the death
[03:47:14.280 --> 03:47:20.120]  benefits of the troops you know my point is people need to realize the amount of brainwashing
[03:47:20.120 --> 03:47:23.800]  that's going on mike adams let me throw out a few news items at people here and get your take on it
[03:47:24.680 --> 03:47:31.320]  wholesale prices up 1.6 percent just the last few months the highest food price index increase
[03:47:31.320 --> 03:47:37.320]  since november of 1974 that's inflation that's associated press here's another one housing
[03:47:37.320 --> 03:47:41.640]  starts see biggest drop since 1984 i thought we're in a the recession ended a year and a half ago
[03:47:41.640 --> 03:47:50.920]  mike or june right 1999 2009 so housing starts see biggest drops since 84 stocks fall on weak
[03:47:50.920 --> 03:47:56.840]  economic reports japan crisis mandatory spending to exceed all federal revenues 50 years ahead of
[03:47:56.840 --> 03:48:03.240]  scheduled weekly damage just total meltdown of the economy jeez 1 billion in nuclear sales at
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:09.800]  risk as nations ponder industry's future bloomberg so we've got that i mean look it's there's total
[03:48:09.800 --> 03:48:15.160]  mismanagement because the economy is set up for a small coterie of bankers to just set up Ponzi
[03:48:15.160 --> 03:48:20.440]  schemes and make short-term profits it's exactly right the systems that we are thriving on or not
[03:48:20.440 --> 03:48:25.560]  even thriving but just surviving on right now in our world are so unsustainable we did an article
[03:48:25.560 --> 03:48:30.440]  recently about 12 the top 12 things that are unsustainable on our planet everything ranging
[03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:36.200]  from the the the debt system that's going to collapse to destruction of habitat you know
[03:48:36.200 --> 03:48:40.840]  clear-cutting a forest to grow genetically modified soybeans there are so many systems
[03:48:40.840 --> 03:48:45.640]  that are unsustainable that as a planet if we don't get on top of this and start finding new
[03:48:45.640 --> 03:48:51.880]  ways to to live on our planet just to just just to have honest money and to have honest health
[03:48:51.880 --> 03:48:57.000]  care you know like real mess it's destroying confidence in the entire system because it's
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:01.880]  so corrupt and then the society breaks down and then we go into the stone age civilization is a
[03:49:01.880 --> 03:49:06.920]  delicate jewel uh and you know we can't pick our genetic ancestors but i this is a term i
[03:49:06.920 --> 03:49:11.960]  want to introduce here we can't pick our genetic ancestors i can't you know say i'm japanese when
[03:49:11.960 --> 03:49:18.600]  i'm not or i can't say i'm portuguese when i'm not but but we can pick our intellectual ancestors
[03:49:18.600 --> 03:49:23.480]  we can pick who we admire people that stand up for real things who are trailblazers who have
[03:49:23.480 --> 03:49:29.560]  courage and and and so we need to ask who are our intellectual ancestors who do we want to
