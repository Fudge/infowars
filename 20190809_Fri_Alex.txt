[00:00.000 --> 00:20.680]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20.680 --> 00:27.800]  Well President Trump's done a lot of newsworthy, important press conferences, they did one
[00:27.800 --> 00:32.840]  out in the 100 degree temperature, in the middle of that Virginia swamp, they called
[00:32.840 --> 00:39.440]  the District of Columbia, and it just ended about 30 minutes ago, and I don't ever play
[00:39.440 --> 00:41.080]  press conferences from start to finish.
[00:41.080 --> 00:45.800]  It's 35 minutes long, we're going to air the whole thing, and I'm going to try to get
[00:45.800 --> 00:48.800]  it all in in the first hour.
[00:48.800 --> 00:55.800]  It was a window into heaven, it was a window into hell, it was the best of times, it was
[00:55.800 --> 00:57.760]  the worst of times.
[00:57.760 --> 01:04.920]  Trump said, I will take strong action, that's a quote against big tech censorship, and then
[01:04.920 --> 01:11.800]  he segued and he said, and Hollywood, what they're doing trying to cause a race war is
[01:11.800 --> 01:14.400]  horrible.
[01:14.400 --> 01:19.760]  Every show you turn on is just white people are literal demons, and a man walked into
[01:19.760 --> 01:25.960]  a Walmart and said, I want a gun to kill 200 people, and they said why, and he said because
[01:25.960 --> 01:31.080]  I saw a white nationalist, a guy that looked like a white nationalist, you know, a ball
[01:31.080 --> 01:37.320]  headed guy, buying a gun, and it's a white guy saying it, all hysterical, because these
[01:37.320 --> 01:44.480]  people believe Netflix, I mean, I can't watch any show about the past, the current, fiction,
[01:44.480 --> 01:52.680]  non-fiction, sci-fi, horror, where just every household or Nazis, every white person is
[01:52.680 --> 01:59.800]  a horrible person, it's total crap.
[01:59.800 --> 02:04.840]  And it's getting crazier and crazier at somebody else at a big Walmart scare right there.
[02:04.840 --> 02:09.720]  This is a total hysteria that's being started.
[02:09.720 --> 02:17.240]  So this is an incredible time to be alive, going after big tech for sure, beating the
[02:17.240 --> 02:22.440]  hell out of the chai comms, they're ready to capitulate, I think that cashmere thing
[02:22.440 --> 02:30.440]  really freaked them out, to have their water supply cut off, and food supply, and just
[02:30.440 --> 02:37.880]  everything else, we've got to play the whole press conference.
[02:37.880 --> 02:45.240]  But of course, right in the middle of it, was the, you know what, the punch pole of
[02:45.240 --> 02:50.840]  President Trump saying, oh, we've got to do something about mental health, we've got to
[02:50.840 --> 02:56.960]  stop these people, we've also got to get rid of these laws that protect them.
[02:56.960 --> 03:05.640]  And that really reminded me, though, of the shooter in Parkland had said he was going
[03:05.640 --> 03:09.720]  to kill people for years, he was known as a school shooter, and he would aim his hand
[03:09.720 --> 03:13.120]  at people and have toy guns and say, I'm going to kill you all the time, because that's what
[03:13.120 --> 03:17.240]  he got attention as, he'd been in and out of all these foster homes, his family recently
[03:17.240 --> 03:22.000]  died, his real parents, but because he had a last name Cruz, even though he was Anglo
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.760]  background, he was given under the Florida law that passed six years ago, authorization
[03:28.760 --> 03:39.520]  to commit crime, robberies, attempted, what was it, arson, vandalism, he would just run
[03:39.520 --> 03:45.800]  around going, they're coming to take me away, and then it happens, and the police stand
[03:45.800 --> 03:53.520]  down, and the school, the kids coming out said, yeah, we always said he's the school
[03:53.520 --> 03:58.560]  shooter, but she said it's funny, because I heard other gunshots and things going off,
[03:58.560 --> 04:05.520]  and he walked by and he said it's not me, but just ignore all that, obvious person drugged
[04:05.520 --> 04:12.360]  out of his mind on SSRIs, that all came out, and then both these guys in Texas and the
[04:12.360 --> 04:25.960]  situation in the Midwest are Antifa, and I've been predicting that they are basically broadcasting
[04:25.960 --> 04:34.360]  out to Antifa now, like this individual that showed up at Walmart and said, I'm going to
[04:34.360 --> 04:39.440]  kill 200 people to make a political point to get the guns, they're figuring it out,
[04:39.440 --> 04:44.000]  the left's going to go do mass shootings, the globalists won't have to stage it, they
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.200]  just tell their people, hey, the way we beat the Trump folks is stage attacks, and then
[04:49.200 --> 04:52.800]  the left goes out and carries out the false flags, you see, they've habituated it down
[04:52.800 --> 04:56.560]  to the local level, kind of like at the chicken place, the left tried to frame me, they were
[04:56.560 --> 05:00.920]  just regular people.
[05:00.920 --> 05:04.840]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square,
[05:04.840 --> 05:09.360]  the other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[05:09.360 --> 05:14.320]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire,
[05:14.320 --> 05:17.920]  that's not being funded by secret foreign government, it is completely independent of
[05:17.920 --> 05:23.160]  all that, it is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[05:23.160 --> 05:27.400]  freedom of press and freedom of speech, that in fact the founders were so concerned with
[05:27.400 --> 05:31.520]  at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations
[05:31.520 --> 05:34.840]  just like this, because this was the kind of press they wanted, and then ultimately
[05:34.840 --> 05:39.000]  we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.520]  sugar daddies, who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons
[05:43.520 --> 05:48.440]  allowed to have or express or hear, and the Info Wars audience has broken through that,
[05:48.440 --> 05:52.720]  that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[05:52.720 --> 05:56.640]  and freedom, and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[05:56.640 --> 06:15.840]  defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth, from the front lines of the information war,
[06:15.840 --> 06:31.760]  that's Alex Jones, Antifa ladies and gentlemen, hit both of the facilities this Saturday, it's
[06:31.760 --> 06:40.040]  all come out, and you're seeing almost no media coverage of that, and now crazy leftist
[06:40.040 --> 06:45.240]  are storming into Walmarts, saying they're going to kill 200 people to make a point about
[06:45.240 --> 06:51.440]  gun control, so they can finally get the guns, so they can quote, finally do something to
[06:51.440 --> 06:59.720]  stop Trump, Florida man asked Walmart employee for anything that would kill 200 people, because
[06:59.720 --> 07:08.400]  then we can finally get the guns, see, carry out the mass murders to blame it on Trump,
[07:08.400 --> 07:19.760]  they're externalizing the hierarchy, the Antifa individual for sure in Ohio was a devil worshiper,
[07:19.760 --> 07:27.360]  Saturday I shot a report, before that was even known, and I said you can take one look
[07:27.360 --> 07:34.880]  at the style of the glasses, his eyes, he is a devil worshiper Antifa, I'm telling you
[07:34.880 --> 07:43.720]  man, they all look just alike, and of course it came out the next day, devil worshiper
[07:43.720 --> 07:51.920]  Antifa attended Antifa rallies and wanted to kill Trump supporters, and wanted and dreamed
[07:51.920 --> 08:01.480]  of caging and torturing and raping women, oh, and they've now found some of his literature,
[08:01.480 --> 08:09.480]  guess what, children, what do demons want to rape and kill women and children, what
[08:09.480 --> 08:20.520]  do demons want, demons want powerful good men disarmed so they can rule over them, and
[08:20.520 --> 08:29.240]  he said I will be with Lucifer soon, I will commit the sacrifices, hail Satan, hail Lucifer,
[08:29.240 --> 08:37.600]  for showing his writings, his drawings, everyone knew this and was scared of him, and nothing
[08:37.600 --> 08:43.840]  was done, so you want more laws, there's already laws in the books, if you say I'm gonna go
[08:43.840 --> 08:51.520]  kill Trump supporters, I'm gonna go kill police, I'm gonna go kill fascist, that's how they
[08:51.520 --> 08:58.640]  dehumanize us, and you got those crazy spoiled rotten mama's boy eyes, because daddy wasn't
[08:58.640 --> 09:08.720]  around to slap you upside the head when you acted like a punk, spoiled rotten little demons,
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.920]  oh, and it's now turning out he was seeing psychologists and others who were taking care
[09:13.920 --> 09:18.680]  of it all, you want to bet money he was on SSRIs, he'll always come out later, always
[09:18.680 --> 09:25.920]  does, and the other one, they're trying to cover up his background, but it's got all
[09:25.920 --> 09:32.600]  the same telltale signs, he went and turned himself into the police, and he was a Democrat,
[09:32.600 --> 09:36.680]  and he was for Obama, and he was for Hillary, and they went on his social media, and they
[09:36.680 --> 09:42.400]  changed it to Republican, and that's admitted, we don't know what's going on in Texas, except
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.800]  he dressed, acted, and looked like Antifa, and then said he was a Democrat, and then
[09:46.800 --> 09:51.040]  went and supposedly killed people, and then went and turned himself into the police to
[09:51.040 --> 10:00.960]  get our guns, and then Trump says very clearly, well I understand the slippery slope and why
[10:00.960 --> 10:05.800]  the NRA and others are worried, but he said we've got to get it to where these local laws
[10:05.800 --> 10:10.040]  like the one in Florida that allowed him to do that are changed, absolutely, you need
[10:10.040 --> 10:13.400]  to change laws where if someone's committing crimes and say they're going to kill people,
[10:13.400 --> 10:16.960]  they go to jail, but that's not mental health, it's mental health putting everybody on the
[10:16.960 --> 10:22.320]  drugs causing all this, handing out the mass murder suicide pills like they're candy, as
[10:22.320 --> 10:33.080]  the mass shootings and the suicides go straight up, we're told more, more, more, let's get
[10:33.080 --> 10:38.520]  the psychologist and psychiatrist as the priest class who just take your guns when they want,
[10:38.520 --> 10:45.080]  no, when you're saying I'm an Antifa and I'm going to kill people, you get your guns taken
[10:45.080 --> 10:57.000]  away, you're in a terrorist organization and Antifa just killed 10 people in the heartland
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.920]  of this country and you don't hear a damn word about it in the news, I'm going to play
[11:00.920 --> 11:08.320]  all of Trump's press conference coming up, and yes, there's more and more reports and
[11:08.320 --> 11:13.960]  more and more articles that if you smoke the new marijuana, the super strong, 50 times
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.680]  stronger than it used to be or more, and you take SSRIs with it, it puts you into a state
[11:18.680 --> 11:25.880]  beyond LSD, more like PCP, and if your radio listeners were putting articles on screen,
[11:25.880 --> 11:31.040]  this is admitted, and by the way, people thought it was a joke in my custody battle when they
[11:31.040 --> 11:38.200]  said do you smoke marijuana, and I said maybe once a year to test the strength of it, and
[11:38.200 --> 11:44.680]  they all laughed at that and thought that that was just completely made up when I maybe
[11:44.680 --> 11:51.320]  smoked marijuana once a year and I ate a cookie that Joey Diaz gave me at a UFC match
[11:51.320 --> 11:55.880]  with Joe Rogan and couldn't get out of the chair for five hours, and I literally did
[11:55.880 --> 12:02.680]  it to see how strong the stuff is, I was hallucinating.
[12:02.680 --> 12:08.240]  So yes, I'm scared of it, and man, the pot, I spoke to a few times in high school, but
[12:08.240 --> 12:13.400]  maybe you want to just sit around and eat Bluebell ice cream, I didn't like that either.
[12:13.400 --> 12:19.360]  What I took a liking to was cigars and whiskey at about 12, first time I tried them I'm like
[12:19.360 --> 12:25.640]  damn this is good, oh yeah my dad had pipe cigars, he was gone, I'd go sneak them, anyways
[12:25.640 --> 12:38.240]  the point is oh the liquor cabinet got raided, but marijuana is now causing massive schizophrenia.
[12:38.240 --> 12:46.760]  I have had beloved crew members who are friends of mine that even went to my Thanksgiving's
[12:46.760 --> 12:52.040]  become schizophrenic and believe that space aliens are in the building and that we are
[12:52.040 --> 13:01.480]  reptiles, that David Knight was a reptile, okay, that's David Knight saying that not
[13:01.480 --> 13:08.280]  me, it's spiritual, it's interdimensional, so you got a bunch of people on Prozac type
[13:08.280 --> 13:15.160]  drugs smoking hallucinogen weapons grade marijuana, I smoked some of this marijuana
[13:15.160 --> 13:21.120]  about eight years ago with the fellow that went crazy, God bless him, and again I couldn't
[13:21.120 --> 13:32.200]  get out of the chair for about an hour, I took one big hit, one hit, 250 pound man,
[13:32.200 --> 13:41.080]  I couldn't get out of a chair, that's why we're in a whole nother ball game, that's
[13:41.080 --> 13:46.600]  why Soros wanted marijuana released, why they weaponized it, it's already been genetically
[13:46.600 --> 13:52.000]  engineered folks and it's not your grandfathers or your fathers or your mothers marijuana,
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.240]  it is a weapon and it permanently rewires the brain and makes you highly suggestible
[13:58.240 --> 14:02.160]  and is extremely dangerous, does it have a lot of medical usage, it's a powerful drug,
[14:02.160 --> 14:09.000]  you damn right it does, alright I'm going to get to the Trump press conference, incredible,
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.280]  he's crossing the Rubicon on this gun thing, he knows that the Democrats are just going
[14:12.280 --> 14:19.400]  to ask for the kitchen sink and then they'll get nothing, but it's still not good to go
[14:19.400 --> 14:27.880]  along with the lie and Trump is involved in a deception which I don't want, he's very
[14:27.880 --> 14:32.240]  straightforward but he knows full well, background checks weren't going to do this and he knows
[14:32.240 --> 14:36.920]  that all these cases people knew they had spoiled rotten in cell little tough guy devil
[14:36.920 --> 14:42.600]  worshipers on their hands, who were seeing psychologists and psychiatrists and who love
[14:42.600 --> 14:49.160]  Satan, that's it, you want to profile them, they're called Satanists, every stinking one
[14:49.160 --> 15:00.960]  of them gets on their knees to the devil, they're white, loner, pissed off devil worshipers
[15:00.960 --> 15:08.240]  who are in Antifa and want to hurt Trump and America and the Christian movement, they
[15:08.240 --> 15:13.560]  want abortion, they want infanticide, they want euthanasia, they want more suicide like
[15:13.560 --> 15:20.160]  Bill Maher said, so I want more suicide, I want more death, he hates his fellow humans,
[15:20.160 --> 15:26.720]  pro-Satan leftist, so that was the bad part of the speech and we're going to get to it,
[15:26.720 --> 15:32.520]  he says he's going after big tech, incredible, he said I'm going to take strong action and
[15:32.520 --> 15:36.120]  then he got into Hollywood trying to cause a race war, Trump is hitting on all cylinders
[15:36.120 --> 15:41.240]  and there's no doubt, we're in the zeitgeist, the White House is tuned in, the US intelligence
[15:41.240 --> 15:47.200]  agencies are tuned in, we are, some pataco right now and we're taking back America and
[15:47.200 --> 15:53.760]  the world, the human life force wave is being released, humanity is coming out of the coma
[15:53.760 --> 15:58.640]  and the globalists and the forces of death can feel it, nothing will stand in our way.

[18:07.200 --> 18:14.720]  heritage, together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America,
[18:14.720 --> 18:20.120]  it is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they

[18:34.160 --> 18:50.760]  future, then there will be nothing that America cannot do.
[18:50.760 --> 18:55.280]  In FullWars.com, tomorrow's news today, full power of the republic in the name of Jesus
[18:55.280 --> 19:00.360]  Christ, full power, damn the torpedoes, go straight at him.
[19:00.360 --> 19:05.320]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary
[19:05.320 --> 19:10.000]  act, and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag, because we still
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.560]  loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it, but
[19:13.560 --> 19:18.640]  now they're trying to take it out of schools, they're taking it down off of government buildings,
[19:18.640 --> 19:22.480]  weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running
[19:22.480 --> 19:27.360]  up Mexican flags, this is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing, so now
[19:27.360 --> 19:32.440]  it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear
[19:32.440 --> 19:37.520]  the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly when
[19:37.520 --> 19:43.200]  it says on the back, right there ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfullwars.com.
[19:43.200 --> 19:47.640]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies
[19:47.640 --> 19:51.960]  face, all over not just the US, but worldwide, because more than ever, the American flag
[19:51.960 --> 20:03.520]  is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[20:03.520 --> 20:29.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:29.520 --> 20:59.320]  We're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[20:59.320 --> 21:28.480]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[21:28.480 --> 21:58.280]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[21:58.280 --> 22:28.080]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[22:28.080 --> 22:57.880]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[22:57.880 --> 23:27.680]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[23:27.680 --> 23:57.480]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[23:57.480 --> 24:27.280]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[24:27.280 --> 24:57.080]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[24:57.080 --> 25:26.880]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[25:26.880 --> 25:56.680]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[25:56.680 --> 26:26.480]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[26:26.480 --> 26:56.280]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[26:56.280 --> 27:26.080]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[27:26.080 --> 27:55.880]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[27:55.880 --> 28:25.680]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[28:25.680 --> 28:55.480]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[28:55.480 --> 29:25.280]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[29:25.280 --> 29:55.080]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[29:55.080 --> 30:24.880]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[30:24.880 --> 30:54.680]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[30:54.680 --> 31:24.480]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[31:24.480 --> 31:54.280]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[31:54.280 --> 32:24.080]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[32:24.080 --> 32:53.880]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[32:53.880 --> 33:14.680]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[33:14.680 --> 33:34.480]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[33:34.480 --> 33:58.280]  we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones, we're listening to Alex Jones,
[33:58.280 --> 34:02.920]  press conference and the amazing things he said that he is going to take strong action
[34:02.920 --> 34:04.960]  against tech censorship soon.
[34:04.960 --> 34:08.800]  That Joe Biden isn't playing with a full deck and has lost his mind.
[34:08.800 --> 34:12.480]  It just went on and on that China is trying to capitulate right now, but we're not going
[34:12.480 --> 34:16.440]  to work with Huawei because it's chai-com run that Hollywood is trying to cause a race
[34:16.440 --> 34:17.440]  war.
[34:17.440 --> 34:23.320]  But I told my producer, hey, send an email to Ted Nugent, NRA board member, great patriot
[34:23.320 --> 34:24.680]  to get his take on the situation.
[34:24.680 --> 34:26.360]  It's got everybody so upset.
[34:26.360 --> 34:28.920]  He just said, boom, I'll call in in five minutes.
[34:28.920 --> 34:31.400]  And that was about four minutes ago.
[34:31.400 --> 34:38.280]  So we're waiting for that call from the good old Motor City madman.
[34:38.280 --> 34:44.320]  And then we will get to all of Trump's press conference one way or the other.
[34:44.320 --> 34:50.160]  Again, we've got Joe Biggs going to be in studio, ladies and gentlemen, and so much more
[34:50.160 --> 34:55.160]  that we're going to be getting to here today.
[34:55.160 --> 35:00.440]  First, replace some clips.
[35:00.440 --> 35:11.080]  I want to go ahead and I want to get to this report that 5G is the future, but it's not
[35:11.080 --> 35:13.400]  really here yet CNN.
[35:13.400 --> 35:16.960]  And remember that they admit this stuff is causing cancer.
[35:16.960 --> 35:18.880]  So here is that report.
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.560]  So this is an actual 5G cell site location here in the East Village.
[35:23.560 --> 35:29.040]  You can see that the 5G site is sort of a small rectangle on top of a longer vertical
[35:29.040 --> 35:30.120]  rectangle.
[35:30.120 --> 35:32.640]  And there are other 4G sites around it.
[35:32.640 --> 35:39.600]  The 5GT mobile site allows sort of this high band millimeter wave to kind of cast a spectrum
[35:39.600 --> 35:44.240]  down and you're able to access these higher speeds if you're in the vicinity around it.
[35:44.240 --> 35:46.080]  So what is 5G anyway?
[35:46.080 --> 35:49.880]  It's the next generation or G of cellular service.
[35:49.880 --> 35:52.960]  2G was more focused on text messaging.
[35:52.960 --> 35:56.000]  3G was sort of the boom of apps.
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.880]  4G introduced faster speech so it could handle Uber or FaceTime.
[36:01.880 --> 36:08.440]  Now 5G is supposed to be 10 times as fast and it'll be able to support self-driving cars,
[36:08.440 --> 36:13.880]  robotic surgeries, even toothbrushes that can tell you when you're sick.
[36:13.880 --> 36:18.400]  Google's 5G network is only in a few cities for now, but it has an aggressive plan to
[36:18.400 --> 36:21.320]  roll out to the rest of the country by next year.
[36:21.320 --> 36:26.160]  AT&T, CNN's parent company, is more focused on helping businesses.
[36:26.160 --> 36:28.760]  And Verizon is all about speed.
[36:28.760 --> 36:32.680]  But I quickly noticed saying on its 5G network was a challenge.
[36:32.680 --> 36:37.080]  Sprint had the most seamless coverage, giving me a glimpse into what life with 5G can really
[36:37.080 --> 36:42.800]  look like, but it also had slower speeds than some of the other providers.
[36:42.800 --> 36:47.920]  You can see how close we are to the 5G cell site right there in the building above the
[36:47.920 --> 36:51.520]  Starbucks, but I can't even get on the network.
[36:51.520 --> 36:53.640]  I'm just only a couple hundred feet away.
[36:53.640 --> 36:54.640]  Oh wait.
[36:54.640 --> 36:57.000]  Okay, I got it.
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.040]  We did a test on T-Mobile's 4G and 5G connections in the park.
[37:01.040 --> 37:06.640]  The 5G network was significantly faster, but it didn't quite hit the high speeds I saw on
[37:06.640 --> 37:07.640]  other networks.
[37:07.640 --> 37:12.920]  So I'm getting really great 5G service right here at the Starbucks and the 5G cell site
[37:12.920 --> 37:20.760]  is right above me, but let's see what happens if I go inside.
[37:20.760 --> 37:21.760]  And there we go.
[37:21.760 --> 37:25.160]  Folks, 5G literally spies on everything you do and gives you cancer.
[37:25.160 --> 37:28.120]  Some people might think that they're already using 5G.
[37:28.120 --> 37:32.240]  On my phone, actually, it says 5GE, which stands for 5G Evolution.
[37:32.240 --> 37:36.160]  Why won't Trump let the Chinese government put this in here?
[37:36.160 --> 37:37.160]  Because it can spy on you.
[37:37.160 --> 37:39.360]  It's probably because you need one of these phones.
[37:39.360 --> 37:41.640]  This is a Samsung 5G phone.
[37:41.640 --> 37:44.120]  It costs $1,300.
[37:44.120 --> 37:46.120]  There are other options on the market too.
[37:46.120 --> 37:51.720]  LG has one that's almost $1,000, but that's still really expensive for network that might
[37:51.720 --> 37:55.000]  not work that great for you and you might not even have access to it.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  They admit.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.800]  So the hype for 5G is high and for good reason.
[37:58.800 --> 38:02.840]  There's so many different applications that's really going to change probably the way we
[38:02.840 --> 38:03.840]  live.
[38:03.840 --> 38:09.400]  For now, service is super spotty, it's really limited, it's expensive, and it's going to
[38:09.400 --> 38:14.240]  take so long for these companies to truly put the equipment in all the different buildings
[38:14.240 --> 38:15.240]  and the lamp posts.
[38:15.240 --> 38:16.240]  Don't worry.
[38:16.240 --> 38:17.240]  It's coming.
[38:17.240 --> 38:18.240]  It's like death.
[38:18.240 --> 38:19.240]  I just want to sit tight and wait.
[38:19.240 --> 38:20.240]  Wait for the grim reaper.
[38:20.240 --> 38:21.240]  Well, you know what that means.
[38:21.240 --> 38:32.200]  When you're at the mall and you hear Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, it means Christmas
[38:32.200 --> 38:33.200]  is close.
[38:33.200 --> 38:38.080]  When you hear Stranglehold, it means Ted Nugent, the great defender of the Second Amendment,
[38:38.080 --> 38:39.080]  is here.
[38:39.080 --> 38:46.800]  The only icon bigger than Charlton Haston maybe, but a living legend joins us and we
[38:46.800 --> 38:50.000]  wouldn't have the Second Amendment probably today if it wasn't for folks like the viewers
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.120]  and listeners of the show and Ted Nugent.
[38:52.120 --> 38:53.800]  Uncle Ted, thanks for coming on.
[38:53.800 --> 38:54.800]  My pleasure, Alex.
[38:54.800 --> 38:57.600]  Happy Independence Day every damn day.
[38:57.600 --> 39:02.800]  Well, what do you make of our friend in the White House and the current statements he's
[39:02.800 --> 39:06.720]  been making that has the NRA upset and has my listeners really getting angry?
[39:06.720 --> 39:12.520]  Well, we're in a strange and extreme times right now, probably the strangest and most
[39:12.520 --> 39:14.800]  extreme in our lifetime.
[39:14.800 --> 39:16.720]  And I still stand with President Trump.
[39:16.720 --> 39:21.920]  I think he's taken in a lot of information and as usual in the political arena, a lot
[39:21.920 --> 39:26.720]  of that information is based on falsehoods and presumptuousness and lies.
[39:26.720 --> 39:33.800]  So at this point, I would recommend patience and hope that we hope that the president will
[39:33.800 --> 39:43.840]  listen to sound minds and educated minds regarding the glaring obvious gun-free zone, self-inflicted
[39:43.840 --> 39:46.800]  slaughter dreams of the left.
[39:46.800 --> 39:52.560]  I mean, all these mass slaughters take place in Nancy Pelosi's dream.
[39:52.560 --> 39:53.600]  She's got her dream.
[39:53.600 --> 39:58.680]  The Democrats have their dream and it's called gun-free zones where evil can do whatever
[39:58.680 --> 40:05.320]  they damn well please because otherwise sheep and citizens have been forced into unarmed
[40:05.320 --> 40:08.920]  helplessness or at least tactical helplessness.
[40:08.920 --> 40:15.960]  So Alex, I have always supported the real Second Amendment, which means an American
[40:15.960 --> 40:22.640]  citizen over the age of 18, not convicted of a felony, gets to carry a gun in America.
[40:22.640 --> 40:30.720]  And if we hadn't been dumbed down and brainwashed to abandon a tactical level of awareness,
[40:30.720 --> 40:38.560]  these evildoers would have never made it to step one or round two in their gun-free slaughter.
[40:38.560 --> 40:46.680]  So I pray and I have faith that Donald Trump will listen to the people who know about firearms
[40:46.680 --> 40:55.760]  reality, ballistics, firepower, and the engineered recidivism and abandonment of responding to
[40:55.760 --> 40:57.240]  glaring threats.
[40:57.240 --> 41:01.520]  I was threatened once and I took the threator into custody.
[41:01.520 --> 41:10.160]  What we need to do, obviously, red flag laws are glaring the unconstitutional, but citizens
[41:10.160 --> 41:16.640]  and law enforcement must respond and utilize laws that are already in place to respond
[41:16.640 --> 41:21.640]  to clear and present threats against innocent lives and we have failed to do so.
[41:21.640 --> 41:26.640]  So faith and patience is my recommendation at this time.
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.720]  Ted, I'm just sitting here speechless.
[41:31.720 --> 41:36.840]  I mean, Trump is going along with the idea that more laws would have stopped this when
[41:36.840 --> 41:43.320]  it's always Antifa devil worshipers on SSRIs who were threatening to kill everybody, especially
[41:43.320 --> 41:46.840]  in the case of Ohio, people begged for help and nothing was done.
[41:46.840 --> 41:49.360]  Same thing happened, as you know, in Florida.
[41:49.360 --> 41:54.160]  So it's just disgusting that they had laws because he was, quote, a minority, Cruz wasn't
[41:54.160 --> 41:59.200]  a minority, he was a white punk, but because of that, he was allowed to commit crimes and
[41:59.200 --> 42:03.080]  threaten to kill people and so more laws aren't going to do that, they're going to target
[42:03.080 --> 42:04.080]  you and I.
[42:04.080 --> 42:11.000]  Yeah, I'm recommending to President Trump and, of course, everybody I can get an ear
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.280]  on and thank you for allowing me to do that once again, Alex, on your broadcast.
[42:16.280 --> 42:21.800]  But we the people are really the most guilty party here because we have not raised adequate
[42:21.800 --> 42:30.140]  hell with elected employees to fight against gun-free zones, fight against the abandonment
[42:30.140 --> 42:38.960]  of the Broward County Sheriff Department, ignoring 43 threats to kill fellow students
[42:38.960 --> 42:47.920]  in Parkland and the FBI, the J. Edgar Hoover joke of ignoring three threats to the FBI
[42:47.920 --> 42:49.600]  at the Parkland incident.
[42:49.600 --> 42:54.640]  So when you have people in authority and power that are standing down, stay right there.
[42:54.640 --> 42:55.640]  One more segment, please.
[42:55.640 --> 42:59.800]  Ted Nugent will be back in just four short minutes.
[42:59.800 --> 43:01.800]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[43:01.800 --> 43:04.880]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[43:04.880 --> 43:09.320]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[43:09.320 --> 43:10.320]  over two decades.
[43:10.320 --> 43:13.680]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[43:13.680 --> 43:17.000]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.280]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[43:21.280 --> 43:22.280]  to their course of conduct.
[43:22.280 --> 43:26.120]  Otherwise, they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent
[43:26.120 --> 43:30.080]  to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy
[43:30.080 --> 43:33.520]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[43:33.520 --> 43:38.680]  The infamous audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[43:38.680 --> 43:43.440]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[43:43.440 --> 43:44.440]  free press.
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.840]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[43:48.840 --> 43:52.600]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole
[43:52.600 --> 43:53.600]  time it's not happening.
[43:53.600 --> 43:55.640]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[43:55.640 --> 43:57.560]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[43:57.560 --> 43:59.040]  Even it is what you just saw.
[43:59.040 --> 44:05.120]  Alex, yes, I got a plug for the Patriot points I get, I got $180 so far this year and I feel
[44:05.120 --> 44:06.560]  like I'm stealing from you.
[44:06.560 --> 44:09.720]  I buy so much in the store because I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[44:09.720 --> 44:12.400]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't
[44:12.400 --> 44:13.400]  believe in.
[44:13.400 --> 44:16.160]  So I'd rather give that money to you and then getting quality products, the products that
[44:16.160 --> 44:18.160]  I do receive have changed my life.
[44:18.160 --> 44:20.520]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[44:20.520 --> 44:21.520]  I've lost weight.
[44:21.520 --> 44:22.520]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[44:22.520 --> 44:24.800]  I think my kids, they use the toothpaste.
[44:24.800 --> 44:28.960]  My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and
[44:28.960 --> 44:29.960]  gets rid of his sore throat.
[44:29.960 --> 44:32.040]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[44:32.040 --> 44:33.520]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[44:33.520 --> 44:37.880]  I want a good price, but I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's
[44:37.880 --> 44:38.880]  50% off.
[44:38.880 --> 44:41.120]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[44:41.120 --> 44:44.760]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[44:44.760 --> 44:45.760]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[44:45.760 --> 44:49.720]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss leader
[44:49.720 --> 44:53.400]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.480]  50% off and then you do something like that where you have Patriot points, we lose money,
[44:57.480 --> 44:58.480]  but that's okay.
[44:58.480 --> 45:02.080]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[45:02.080 --> 45:04.240]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[45:04.240 --> 45:07.840]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[45:07.840 --> 45:13.200]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[45:13.200 --> 45:14.920]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[45:14.920 --> 45:18.160]  I don't want to hear an ad, but here's the bottom line.
[45:18.160 --> 45:22.200]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face of the globalist, not contract.
[45:22.200 --> 45:23.440]  I don't want them to win.
[45:23.440 --> 45:26.360]  So listen, you've got this guarantee for me.
[45:26.360 --> 45:31.040]  Be so enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really
[45:31.040 --> 45:34.520]  give the globalists room for their money, but we've got products you already really
[45:34.520 --> 45:38.000]  need like DNA Force Plus, X2, these will change your life.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.480]  Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration, check
[45:41.480 --> 45:42.480]  it all out.
[45:42.480 --> 45:45.800]  Whatever you do, take action and know, be part of the Second American Revolution.
[45:45.800 --> 45:49.040]  Be part of Crush the Globalist and get great products at the same time.
[45:49.040 --> 45:51.480]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[45:51.480 --> 45:53.520]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[45:53.520 --> 45:57.200]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[46:24.520 --> 46:28.600]  It's on folks and if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's going to
[46:28.600 --> 46:29.600]  go insane.
[46:29.600 --> 46:32.840]  So now, more than you've ever done, for yourself, for me, for everybody, spread the word about
[46:32.840 --> 46:37.200]  this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV, tell folks about Infowars.com, Ford slash
[46:37.200 --> 46:38.200]  Go.
[46:38.200 --> 46:42.440]  But that said, I want to fight hard and I need you to buy the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[46:42.440 --> 46:47.880]  Huge sale, the one year anniversary, banning sale, the banniversary sale, 56% off, store
[46:47.880 --> 46:51.480]  wide free shipping, double patriot points, get all the great products you need and know
[46:51.480 --> 46:56.080]  you are funding, not just the Second American Revolution, but a pro-human future against
[46:56.080 --> 47:22.080]  the devil worshiping Satanist and their off-world controllers.
[47:22.080 --> 47:39.520]  Head Nugent joins us for another segment and then I'm going to get to the incredible clips
[47:39.520 --> 47:46.160]  of President Trump's speech where he said that we're defeating the Chai Khons and that
[47:46.160 --> 47:50.640]  Joe Biden's not playing with a full deck and is losing his mind, which is totally true,
[47:50.640 --> 47:55.680]  and that he's going to crack down on all the incredible censorship and persecution of conservatives
[47:55.680 --> 47:56.960]  that's taking place.
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.440]  All that great news, but giving in to the idea that more gun laws is going to help us
[48:01.440 --> 48:06.120]  when the Democrats admit their plan is to take our guns.
[48:06.120 --> 48:10.560]  They want victim disarmament, they want political power like Mao Zedong had where only the state
[48:10.560 --> 48:11.560]  has the power.
[48:11.560 --> 48:14.120]  Ted Nugent, where do you think this is going?
[48:14.120 --> 48:15.440]  Why do you think Trump is saying this?
[48:15.440 --> 48:18.320]  Is it just him trying to take wind out of their sails because they're going to come
[48:18.320 --> 48:23.920]  back and ask for the farm and then it shows that they're the ones that aren't reasonable?
[48:23.920 --> 48:24.920]  What do you think?
[48:24.920 --> 48:30.080]  Well, number one, again, Alex, I'm on tour right now and I meet with heroes of military
[48:30.080 --> 48:33.920]  and law enforcement and just great American families every day.
[48:33.920 --> 48:39.320]  I'll be getting on stage for my 6,734th rock out.
[48:39.320 --> 48:47.320]  That means 6,734 meetings backstage campfires with people who care, people in the asset column.
[48:47.320 --> 48:53.480]  And I think we need to maintain focus on the big picture and that is that thank God Almighty,
[48:53.480 --> 48:56.120]  Donald J. Trump is the president.
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.920]  The alternative would be cultural suicide overnight.
[49:00.920 --> 49:08.440]  So we do have the only guy that could possibly move forward with America first.
[49:08.440 --> 49:10.800]  So do not lose focus on that.
[49:10.800 --> 49:13.680]  Again, I recommend patience and faith.
[49:13.680 --> 49:19.400]  I know that the president sometimes says things that are coarse and scares the hell
[49:19.400 --> 49:22.880]  out of everybody, but I believe that he's one of us.
[49:22.880 --> 49:25.800]  I believe that he is a real American.
[49:25.800 --> 49:29.760]  We the people representative, I know he believes in the Constitution.
[49:29.760 --> 49:35.920]  He has gone against political correctness and the political suicide that exists otherwise.
[49:35.920 --> 49:40.880]  So I don't know exactly what decisions he's going to make, but Alex, truth logic and
[49:40.880 --> 49:46.280]  common sense dictates conclusively that we need fewer gun laws.
[49:46.280 --> 49:53.120]  We need to eliminate 90% of the gun laws because the gun control laws that Nancy Pelosi and
[49:53.120 --> 49:59.920]  the left have implemented are the cause, the root of encouraging evil to slaughter innocents
[49:59.920 --> 50:06.760]  in the gun free zones and the dumbing down of America that has destroyed a tactical level
[50:06.760 --> 50:08.800]  of situational awareness.
[50:08.800 --> 50:13.320]  So I'm like you, I pray that he's going to do the right thing, but I have faith in this
[50:13.320 --> 50:19.920]  great man and remember the alternative to Donald J. Trump would have already turned
[50:19.920 --> 50:22.680]  us into a suburb of Venezuela.
[50:22.680 --> 50:25.360]  So thank God we got this great man there.
[50:25.360 --> 50:28.360]  I believe he will do the right thing.
[50:28.360 --> 50:30.080]  I believe he will as well.
[50:30.080 --> 50:34.840]  And you know, I've talked to a lot of folks in and around high up in the NRA.
[50:34.840 --> 50:38.800]  Have you ever heard any of them tell you that, you know, Trump basically comes out with something
[50:38.800 --> 50:43.400]  that sounds reasonable just so they'll ask for the farm and really show their hand and
[50:43.400 --> 50:48.160]  that's what they've done several times and he's just basically playing them like a fiddle.
[50:48.160 --> 50:50.280]  He is the ultimate strategist.
[50:50.280 --> 50:55.520]  I have had blessed time with this great man and I work closely with his son, Donald Trump
[50:55.520 --> 51:01.000]  Jr. And believe me, Alex, you would think that the sons of Donald Trump brought up in
[51:01.000 --> 51:07.160]  a millionaire brainwash epicenter of Manhattan would be leftist extremists.
[51:07.160 --> 51:10.240]  I'm telling you, these guys are so down to earth.
[51:10.240 --> 51:12.000]  They know ballistics.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  They know firearms history.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.080]  They know the absolutism of the Second Amendment.
[51:17.080 --> 51:19.320]  They know the terminology in the nomenclature.
[51:19.320 --> 51:20.720]  These are gun guys.
[51:20.720 --> 51:27.240]  Don and Eric Trump, these are real gun guys and who's got the ear of the president more
[51:27.240 --> 51:28.760]  than his sons?
[51:28.760 --> 51:30.240]  I say nobody.
[51:30.240 --> 51:34.040]  The NRA is going through tough times right now, but the same with the National Rifle
[51:34.040 --> 51:35.200]  Association.
[51:35.200 --> 51:37.820]  We still have to be members.
[51:37.820 --> 51:39.320]  We have to support it.
[51:39.320 --> 51:40.840]  We're going to get past these guys.
[51:40.840 --> 51:43.440]  Oh, look, look, they've tried to set infiltrators in here.
[51:43.440 --> 51:44.880]  I know they've done horrible things to you.
[51:44.880 --> 51:46.240]  We won't even get into.
[51:46.240 --> 51:48.800]  They've told incredible lies about you, incredible lies about me.
[51:48.800 --> 51:53.480]  And obviously inside the NRA, all sorts of attempted sabotage, that's when people got
[51:53.480 --> 51:59.120]  to support even more is when these these good institutions that have defended our blessed
[51:59.120 --> 52:00.920]  freedoms are under attack.
[52:00.920 --> 52:02.920]  That's when we really got to support.
[52:02.920 --> 52:03.920]  Absolutely.
[52:03.920 --> 52:08.720]  Gun owners of America, the Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership, certainly every state
[52:08.720 --> 52:10.520]  firearms rights organization.
[52:10.520 --> 52:15.760]  I got to tell you, the listeners that are not members of the NRA, Nancy Pelosi, thanks
[52:15.760 --> 52:16.760]  you.
[52:16.760 --> 52:21.560]  The listeners who are not members of their state firearms rights organizations, Cory
[52:21.560 --> 52:23.560]  Booker would like to thank you.
[52:23.560 --> 52:27.420]  It really is about we the people, freedom, activism.
[52:27.420 --> 52:29.280]  You have to be engaged.
[52:29.280 --> 52:31.760]  You have to be a member of the NRA.
[52:31.760 --> 52:35.080]  Gun owners of America, your state rifle association.
[52:35.080 --> 52:40.200]  If you're not, the enemy thinks you're on their side and you are.
[52:40.200 --> 52:41.200]  That's the curse.
[52:41.200 --> 52:42.880]  The enemy doesn't win.
[52:42.880 --> 52:45.640]  We lose when we're not engaged.
[52:45.640 --> 52:51.760]  That's the battle cry for America first and real nationalism, not white nationalism, not
[52:51.760 --> 52:57.880]  gray nationalism, not black nationalism, the United States of America first.
[52:57.880 --> 53:02.920]  Stop and think, Alex, who is angry at President Trump's battle cry of America first?
[53:02.920 --> 53:04.320]  I'll tell you who.
[53:04.320 --> 53:09.760]  The enemies of America, which includes the entire damn Democrat Party.
[53:09.760 --> 53:11.240]  Shame on them.
[53:11.240 --> 53:17.000]  They, the Democrats, are the enemies of freedom, the enemies of the Constitution, and the enemies
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.000]  of America.
[53:18.000 --> 53:23.200]  We don't vote Republican if the independence and Democrats who want freedom in America
[53:23.200 --> 53:24.680]  is the last best place.
[53:24.680 --> 53:30.480]  If you're not a member of the NRA, Nancy Pelosi and all her fellow freaks, they think you're
[53:30.480 --> 53:32.480]  on their side.
[53:32.480 --> 53:34.920]  That's the curse of America.
[53:34.920 --> 53:36.160]  And let's expand on that.
[53:36.160 --> 53:37.680]  Let's spend a few minutes.
[53:37.680 --> 53:38.680]  Trump coming up later.
[53:38.680 --> 53:43.160]  I'm going to have the clip when we air the press conference.
[53:43.160 --> 53:48.480]  They made the point that Hollywood aren't the elites, big tech's not the elites, they're
[53:48.480 --> 53:53.720]  the ones that are crushing the elites, the real elite of media that's popular, the real
[53:53.720 --> 53:55.360]  elite of rock and roll.
[53:55.360 --> 54:00.000]  All the attempts they've done to block you and venues around the country, all the attempts
[54:00.000 --> 54:05.640]  to bankrupt the cycling company because the owner is a Trump supporter.
[54:05.640 --> 54:09.560]  All of their bullying, all of their attempts at race war, and Trump in his speech today
[54:09.560 --> 54:16.200]  brought up Hollywood and how they're trying to, every movie I tune into or show on Netflix,
[54:16.200 --> 54:21.360]  white people are the devil, KKK's everywhere, white supremacists are everywhere, crazy people
[54:21.360 --> 54:24.920]  are coming in Walmart saying they want to get guns and start shooting white people.
[54:24.920 --> 54:28.960]  And it's white people that are saying it because white and so-called Hollywood stars
[54:28.960 --> 54:33.120]  are getting on their knees in front of the flag saying, I'll never stand for it again.
[54:33.120 --> 54:36.400]  And they're saying that white people are inherently bad, they're sorry they're white people.
[54:36.400 --> 54:38.040]  I mean, these people have gone crazy.
[54:38.040 --> 54:39.040]  What the hell are they doing?
[54:39.040 --> 54:41.520]  Alex, stop and think about it for a minute.
[54:41.520 --> 54:43.240]  Somebody write this down.
[54:43.240 --> 54:48.320]  Who coined the phrase, make America white again?
[54:48.320 --> 54:55.240]  Nancy Pelosi coined the phrase and then she just dishonestly and hatefully attributed
[54:55.240 --> 54:57.320]  it to our president.
[54:57.320 --> 55:02.480]  Donald Trump has never uttered the words, make America white again.
[55:02.480 --> 55:03.480]  That's right.
[55:03.480 --> 55:08.120]  They invoke the white supremacism, they put all this out there and then say that we're
[55:08.120 --> 55:09.120]  doing it.
[55:09.120 --> 55:10.120]  It's incredible.
[55:10.120 --> 55:11.120]  It's absolutely incredible.
[55:11.120 --> 55:17.720]  They call me a racist, but it's Don LeMond and everybody at MSNBC and CNN who use the
[55:17.720 --> 55:19.720]  term white nationalist.
[55:19.720 --> 55:21.520]  I've never said that.
[55:21.520 --> 55:22.880]  You've never said that.
[55:22.880 --> 55:24.960]  Donald Trump has never said that.
[55:24.960 --> 55:30.280]  These people will literally rob the bank and then claim that you did it.
[55:30.280 --> 55:33.600]  The Democrats have lost their souls.
[55:33.600 --> 55:40.940]  If you have a D after your name, believe in infanticide, if you support the Democrats,
[55:40.940 --> 55:47.320]  you want to destroy the security of America by demanding open borders.
[55:47.320 --> 55:53.880]  If you're a Democrat, you want to make America weak and stupid by giving them a guaranteed
[55:53.880 --> 55:56.440]  paycheck for no effort.
[55:56.440 --> 55:59.480]  That makes you weak and stupid.
[55:59.480 --> 56:01.560]  And Ted, here's what's even crazier.
[56:01.560 --> 56:06.360]  You are a liability and that is the battle cry of the Democrats.
[56:06.360 --> 56:13.320]  They think that mindless, soulless, stupid sheep will fall for that stuff.
[56:13.320 --> 56:16.480]  And Alex, I'm afraid to say they're correct.
[56:16.480 --> 56:20.400]  If you fall for that stuff, you are the enemy of America.
[56:20.400 --> 56:26.080]  You should move to Venezuela as quickly as you can because they've already got the policies
[56:26.080 --> 56:27.880]  you believe in.
[56:27.880 --> 56:28.880]  Shame on you.
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.120]  They've beautifully said, thank you for coming on on short notice in the aftermath of what's
[56:33.120 --> 56:34.120]  unfolding.
[56:34.120 --> 56:35.680]  I think they're trying to create some more crises.
[56:35.680 --> 56:39.640]  Big study came out admitting that the media hyping mass shootings is actually making these
[56:39.640 --> 56:40.920]  psychos go out and do it.
[56:40.920 --> 56:45.360]  They're just hoping for more so they can then blame the American people and all the innocent
[56:45.360 --> 56:46.360]  folks out there.
[56:46.360 --> 56:48.760]  TedNugent.com, the website, be sure and visit it.
[56:48.760 --> 56:52.240]  Uncle Ted, thanks for spending time with us and thanks for defending the Constitution
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.400]  and Bill of Rights and our right to self-defense for my children and the rest of the children's
[56:56.400 --> 56:57.400]  future in this country.
[56:57.400 --> 56:58.840]  You got it, Alex.
[56:58.840 --> 56:59.840]  Freedom is not free.
[56:59.840 --> 57:04.360]  I'm just a guitar player, but I fight for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and
[57:04.360 --> 57:06.200]  the American Dream every damn day.
[57:06.200 --> 57:12.040]  I hope people will come to my Facebook because truth, logic, and common sense reign supreme.
[57:12.040 --> 57:13.040]  God bless America, man.
[57:13.040 --> 57:14.040]  Beautiful.
[57:14.040 --> 57:15.040]  Thank you, Ted.
[57:15.040 --> 57:16.040]  All right, folks.
[57:16.040 --> 57:17.040]  We're going to break.
[57:17.040 --> 57:18.040]  I'm going to get to some of the press conference.
[57:18.040 --> 57:19.040]  Then we're going to have Joe Biggs in here with us.
[57:19.040 --> 57:23.680]  I got so excited watching this press conference, you know, the fat ground check thing and
[57:23.680 --> 57:24.680]  all that.
[57:24.680 --> 57:25.680]  The red flag was bad.
[57:25.680 --> 57:26.680]  It's not going to happen.
[57:26.680 --> 57:27.680]  Okay.
[57:27.680 --> 57:31.720]  Unless they get another dozen or more of these mass shootings, which you know they're cooking

[57:34.200 --> 57:37.520]  These are all Democrat, you know, jurisdictions in areas where they know who these guys are.
[57:37.520 --> 57:39.160]  They just let them get ready.
[57:39.160 --> 57:41.000]  The police stand down.
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.160]  It's a nightmare, ladies and gentlemen, but we're going to be covering all of it.

[58:30.360 --> 58:34.920]  every time you tell the truth, every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human
[58:34.920 --> 58:39.360]  values alive, the enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[58:39.360 --> 58:42.600]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[58:42.600 --> 58:46.360]  And now we've got a fighting chance if y'all take action of defeating the globalist.

[58:47.360 --> 58:48.360]  We'll be right back.
[58:48.360 --> 58:51.040]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[58:51.040 --> 58:56.000]  Last night, I'm on inforwarstore.com and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  choice.
[58:57.000 --> 59:02.120]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned, a Betsy Ross, but also another just classic
[59:02.120 --> 59:07.000]  American flag, all 50 stars, with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it.
[59:07.000 --> 59:11.200]  And on the back, America's back, inforwarstore.com, but what's better than just an American flag
[59:11.200 --> 59:14.520]  about a don't try it on me under the flag, saying don't try on the American flag.
[59:14.520 --> 59:15.520]  It's a perfect combo.
[59:15.520 --> 59:16.520]  So great minds think alike.
[59:16.520 --> 59:19.720]  I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same similar
[59:19.720 --> 59:20.720]  design.
[59:20.720 --> 59:25.400]  I mean, don't try it on me, American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist
[59:25.400 --> 59:30.160]  of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt, but it's a battle tattered flag like the one that flew
[59:30.160 --> 59:31.160]  over Fort Sumter.
[59:31.160 --> 59:38.400]  And again, on the back, it says America's back, infowars.com, 4,000 of these babies.
[59:38.400 --> 59:39.400]  And that's it.
[59:39.400 --> 59:43.480]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at inforwarstore.com.
[59:43.480 --> 59:46.880]  You can print it in the USA right now, inforwarstore.com.
[59:46.880 --> 01:00:14.960]  They'll be right back, the most banned broadcast in the world.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.960]  All right, let's just do this.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.120]  I've got Joe Biggs coming up, can't wait to have him in studio.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:26.120]  We've got huge breaking news with Mark Rondaza with the biggest cache of info yet coming
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.360]  out on Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.560]  And I've had a mental overload again today because the quickening here, everything is
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.560]  insane.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.600]  Trump saying, oh, I will, I'm going to take strong action against Big Tech.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.440]  Oh, in Hollywood, trying to cause a race war, very, very dangerous.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.420]  I mean, this is just solid platinum, folks.
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.800]  This is like water in the desert.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.120]  This is so good.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.600]  And he's trying to create unity, he's trying to bring people together.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:03.160]  And he is also trying to neutralize their claim of we've got to do something.
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.240]  You can't do anything.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.740]  There's evil people, society's falling apart.
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:12.880]  We need guns to protect ourselves from these devil worshipping liberals who are going to
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:20.080]  go out and kill more people to get our guns because they want to dominate us.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.760]  Antifa wants the guns to kill Christians and kill conservatives.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.360]  And they know that get laws passed, they're going to be the government.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.800]  Now these little satanic drone robots are just kill, kill for Satan, kill for Satan.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.680]  You know, that's just kill, kill, kill for Satan.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:39.360]  That's what they go out and put the higher ups, the principalities above them pulling
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.720]  the strings.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.440]  That's what we're dealing with.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.600]  So I'm going to just get started with the press conference now.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.880]  It's 35 minutes long.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:52.480]  I watched most of it and had to leave coming to the office.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.200]  And it's just, I mean, the whole thing's amazing.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.200]  So here it is.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:06.760]  So we're doing very well with China.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.040]  We're talking to China.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.240]  We're not ready to make a deal.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:16.080]  We'll see what happens, but, you know, we've been hurt by China for 25, 30 years.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.640]  Nobody's done anything about it.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.800]  And we have no choice but to do what we're doing.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.120]  It's working out very well.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:31.600]  As you know, we, we call them on manipulation and they brought their numbers back and they
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.360]  brought them back rapidly and they were able to do that because they manipulate.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:41.960]  But that's how it's called monetary manipulation, not good.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.400]  But what happened and what's happening with China now, we have an open dialogue.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.120]  We'll see whether or not we keep our meeting in September.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.760]  If we do that, it's fine.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.960]  If we don't, that's fine.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.360]  But it's time that somebody does what we're doing.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.840]  And I said, the American taxpayer is not paying for it.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:03.920]  We had a big day in the stock market yesterday, but the American taxpayer is not paying for
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.240]  it.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:10.320]  What China is doing is by depressing their currency and by pouring tremendous amounts
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.160]  of money into their system, they're paying for it.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.240]  The prices have not gone up.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:21.040]  So when the, in fact, in some cases they've gone down because the devaluation plus the
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:28.840]  money supply, the amount of money that they pour in, which is a form of manipulation,
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.080]  has more than compensated for an increase in price.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:37.720]  So as I said, and everybody questioned it, in the case of China, the tariffs have been
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.720]  amazing.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.840]  We're taking in billions and billions of dollars.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.960]  Now China's had their worst year in 35 years now.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.720]  It wasn't 26 years, but now it's in 35 years.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.320]  I want them to do well.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.880]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.120]  I mean, that first two minutes, you can talk about all day.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.560]  The globalist set up a project to deindustrialize us.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.560]  They admitted it.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560]  They bragged about it.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560]  It's the end of the American century.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.200]  It's the new Chinese century, the millennium.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.240]  They've had a totally one-sided deal on every front from currency manipulation to no environmental
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:15.640]  standards, to one-sided trade deals, to stealing intellectual properties.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:20.320]  And Trump just said, look, you're effing us over is over, but the Chai comms own our debt,
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.120]  own Hollywood, and are activating their people.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.520]  So think about how sensational that is.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.400]  That's why I'm physically in war mode all the time, and I'm hard to be around now.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.840]  I apologize to the crew because this is epic history.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.840]  See, I'm wired right.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.840]  I don't know.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.280]  You viewers and losers are too.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.840]  You know how epic all this is.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.680]  That's two minutes of the 35 minutes.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.680]  It gets crazier.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.280]  It gets better.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.640]  And then he puts the third and the punch bowl with the gun control.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:49.360]  But see, that's so the Democrats come out and say, we want everything, which they're
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.360]  going to do.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.360]  They're already doing it.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.360]  And they'll get nothing.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:05:01.000]  They'll get nothing and like it, spelling our powerful line of fluoride free products

[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:13.040]  Devastating globalist lies exposing the mainstream media propaganda machine tirelessly waging
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:19.920]  war on corruption from deep in the heart of FEMA region six in Austin, Texas, transmitting
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.760]  worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:32.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:37.080]  I have officially reached information overload, Trump's 35 minute press conference was so
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.080]  incredible.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:42.920]  The things he said if you know what you're listening to, a lot of it was just straight
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.920]  up Joe Biden.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920]  I have a full deck.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920]  He's out of his mind.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.560]  I can't believe he's going to be their nominee, but I'll beat him.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.280]  It's all true.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.520]  I will take strong action against big tech and Hollywood.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.800]  They're trying to cause a race war.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.600]  We're crushing China and their screw job against us.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.800]  America's dominating again.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.360]  I mean, this is all true.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:13.120]  Always a chai com operation, we're not going to do business with them.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.600]  This is not authoritarian.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.000]  This is standing up for America.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.240]  This is strong.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.040]  This is so good.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:26.440]  We had Ted Nugent on last hour and he has faith in the president and I asked him, I said,
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:32.000]  have you talked any high level in our eight people and about Trump's plan when they call
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.880]  for gun control, he'll say something that sounds reasonable, but we know it's a slippery
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.840]  slope and they'll demand the entire slope and he said, yes, that's what the president's
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.840]  doing.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.840]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.360]  I think it's pretty obvious, but it's not just Ted Nugent I've talked to.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:54.240]  I've talked to other people and I'll leave it at that.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.640]  Someone very close to the president, why you might even say the president, but that's
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.240]  what's going on here and Trump hasn't double crossed us yet.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.160]  Still though, ladies and gentlemen, the bump stock thing was done because it doesn't have
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.160]  a lobby.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:13.840]  It's a piece of crap, but it still is the slippery slope and that's the big blemish on
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.600]  Trump right now.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.960]  But on so many other fronts, he's really trying to rectify and write the ship.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:26.240]  Let's go back to the press conference.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.800]  And then we've got Joe Biggs coming up later on the broadcast.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.040]  We're looking at that right now.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.520]  We have a lot of these companies coming in a little while.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.080]  As you know, we're going to be very tough with them.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.200]  They're treating conservatives very unfairly.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.640]  Hollywood, I don't call them the elites.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.680]  I think the elites are people they go after in many cases, but Hollywood is really terrible.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.000]  You talk about races.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  Hollywood is racist.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.040]  What they're doing with the kind of movies they're putting out, it's actually very dangerous
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.440]  for our country.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:04.880]  What Hollywood is doing is a tremendous disservice to our country.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:11.000]  We have now in a little while all of the heads of the biggest companies coming in, and we're
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.160]  going to talk to them.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:19.200]  They treat conservatives, Republicans totally different than they treat others.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.560]  They can't do that.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.760]  And then we're going to come back with more on what he said about Hollywood.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.800]  But let's go back to the press conference about three minutes in when he was finishing
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.800]  up saying that we're not going to put up with China's garbage.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800]  Here it is.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.600]  I have a very good relationship.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.000]  I'll change it.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.760]  I have a great relationship with the NRA.
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.360]  I have a lot of respect for the people at the NRA, and I have already spoken to them
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:52.880]  on numerous occasions, numerous occasions, and frankly, we need intelligent background
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.880]  checks.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.440]  This isn't a question of NRA, Republican or Democrat.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.440]  I will tell you, I spoke to Mitch McConnell yesterday.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440]  He's totally on board.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.880]  He said, I've been waiting for your call.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.520]  He is totally on board.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:14.760]  I spoke to senators that in some cases, people, friends of mine, but pretty hard line senators,
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.760]  hard line.
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:20.320]  And when I say that, I say that in a positive way, hard line on the Second Amendment.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:27.200]  And they understand we don't want insane people, mentally ill people, bad people.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.200]  Dangerous people.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.960]  We don't want guns in the hands of the wrong people.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:38.000]  I think that the Republicans are going to be great and lead the charge along with the
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Democrats.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.400]  I spoke yesterday to Nancy Pelosi with a great talk.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.880]  I spoke to Chuck Schumer.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:50.680]  We had a great talk, and Chuck Schumer in particular loves my China policy, as you probably know.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.920]  I said, I can't believe it.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.000]  You actually like something that I'm doing.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.120]  He said, not like, love.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:01.480]  So Chuck Schumer is, he's great on the China situation, which we are winning and winning
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.800]  big, and China wants to do something, but I'm not ready to do anything yet.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.760]  25 years of abuse, I'm not ready so fast, but we'll see how that works out.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:19.520]  But on the, on the background checks, on background checks, we have tremendous support for really
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:35.240]  common sense, sensible, important background checks.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.240]  Time goes by.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.000]  I don't think I'm different, but I think the Senate is different.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.840]  I think other people in the House are different.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:50.320]  I think that people that maybe had their arm up a couple of years ago, maybe they feel
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.320]  differently.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.760]  I don't think I feel any differently.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:58.600]  I think with a lot of success that we have, I think I have a greater influence now over
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.720]  the Senate and over the House.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.840]  I think we can get something really good done.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.200]  I think we can have some really meaningful background checks.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:13.240]  We don't want people that are mentally ill, people that are, are sick.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.240]  We don't want them having guns.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.240]  Who does?
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:26.720]  Well, we'll see where the NRA will be, but we have to have meaningful background checks.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:31.920]  You know, in the case of, in both cases, it's possible they wouldn't have been caught.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:37.600]  But in the one case, we also have to talk about age, because he did things that were
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.120]  very, very bad in Ohio, in Dayton.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.360]  He did some things that were really bad.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.800]  His school knew about it.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.800]  When he turned 18, everything was expunged.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.760]  We're going to have to get rid of that, because you can't have that barrier.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.440]  If they would have had that barrier, they would have been able to see.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.880]  But because he was a minor, it was expunged.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.400]  We're going to have to get rid of that barrier.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:08.120]  I think this, I think a lot of really meaningful things on background checks will take place,
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:14.160]  including red flags, including a lot of other very, very important items, and the Republicans
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.360]  are looking at it very seriously.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.960]  And I really believe that the NRA, I've spoken to them numerous times, they're really good
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960]  people.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.960]  They're great patriots.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.960]  They love our country.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.960]  They love our country so much.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:25.960]  And frankly, I really think they're going to get there also.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:48.640]  I had a good talk with Wayne, and I liked Wayne, and you know, they supported me very
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:55.160]  early, far earlier than anybody thought possible, especially me not being a politician.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.480]  But that support has paid off.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.160]  We now have two Supreme Court justices that are phenomenal, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:07.880]  And I mean, they're phenomenal people, and there are people evens in the Second Amendment,
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:10.000]  which Wayne is also, and which I am.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:17.200]  I mean, there's been no president that feels more strongly about the Second Amendment than
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.200]  I do.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:24.400]  However, we need meaningful background checks so that sick people don't get gunned.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:34.280]  I think in the end, I think in the end, Wayne and the NRA will either be there or maybe
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:37.840]  will be a little bit more neutral, and that would be okay too.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:44.480]  Look, look, the NRA has over the years taken a very, very tough stance on everything, and
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.480]  I understand it.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.480]  You know, it's a slippery slope.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:51.040]  They think you approve one thing, and that leads to a lot of bad things.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.240]  I don't agree with them.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.840]  I think we could do meaningful, very meaningful background checks.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:03.520]  I want to see it happen, so I've got a lot of support, and I also have the support of
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:09.360]  other people on the other side, and I think the Democrats and Republicans have a chance
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.360]  to really come together.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:14.200]  All right, we're going to come back with Joe Biggs in the studio.
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.320]  We'll have more of these clips, but I'm going to play that bombshell clip again.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.320]  Did you hear that?
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.400]  Hollywood is creating a race war, Hollywood is racist.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.960]  I'm afraid seriously to go to movies now, because I don't want to go see a movie like
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:33.880]  Machete where white people are shooting pregnant Hispanic ladies in the stomach, and it's
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:39.240]  not even true, and then now almost every movie is like that.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.360]  I don't want to go hear about race all day when I see a movie and then race wars, like
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:49.120]  rolling a big brainwashing camp, but that's what this is, big tech censorship, and Hollywood
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.800]  trying to start a race war.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.640]  They're trying to tear our country apart while they censor us.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:03.760]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.760]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.760]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:11.640]  You need survivalist camps, the ultimate fully functional off the grid mobile survival bug
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:16.360]  outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer.

[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.360]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.360]  the world.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.400]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:42.360]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.160]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.160]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.720]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:55.280]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.440]  at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.960]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.240]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.640]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.160]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.160]  across America.

[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.720]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.720]  healthier I feel.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.360]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.640]  Over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.040]  keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.160]  If you want to bet on your future, if you want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.480]  on not being run by the chai comms with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:12.240]  fund the Democrats and MSM and CNN, the Chinese government does, it's all coming out.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.240]  Democrats aren't going to stop.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.240]  They're trying to cause a civil war right now.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:17.320]  Like, they're starting to get some purchase, trying to start a fire, they got some fire
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.320]  going.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.880]  All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ice facilities getting attacked, dead people
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:26.000]  everywhere, it's on, folks, and if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  it's going to go insane.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.480]  So now, more than you've ever done, for yourself, for me, for everybody, spread the word about
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.680]  this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV, tell folks about InfoWorks.com, workslash
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.680]  show.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.080]  But that said, I want to fight hard, and I need you to buy the products at infoworkstore.com.

[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.400]  the devil-worshipping, Satanist, and their off-world controllers.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.880]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWorks.com,
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:09.400]  but also the products at InfoWorks.com, and there's one product that's offered at InfoWorks.com
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.440]  that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.160]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.960]  Telomere's, and Telomere's support with your DNA, and so I started to look into the science
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:29.160]  and what Telomere's were, and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.160]  your Telomere's.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.360]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:34.360]  Why?
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.520]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.520]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:46.800]  Telomere's support, and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.280]  It is the elite supplement.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:52.160]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:20:01.360]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWorksStore.com.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:14.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:23.120]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide, I'm Alex
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.680]  Jones, Joe Biggs, former InfoWorks reporter, off doing his own great work, banned from
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.920]  everywhere, getting lots of visits from the FBI.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:34.400]  We'll tell you about that in a moment because what's happening to Joe is what I call a rosetta
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:39.160]  stone or a skeleton key, a window into what's really happening.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:43.920]  Antifa is threatening to kill him, going to Mitch McConnell's house, threatening to kill
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.920]  him.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:49.280]  All this is happening, but Joe Biggs says he's going to go to Portland, coming up just
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.720]  a week and a half or so, and just going to be peacefully there and saying, we're going
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:53.720]  to march.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:54.720]  We're not going to put up with these communists.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.040]  And boy, the FBI has been talking to his family, everybody that knows him.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.000]  We got a terrorist right here, folks.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.120]  The week after the FBI put that report out, saying the conspiracy theorist are the number
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:10.440]  one terrorist enemy, even though that's just asking questions, so you can see where all
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.440]  this is going.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.200]  But first, President Trump, you know, 35-minute news commers, we've already aired about half
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.600]  of it, just incredible statements.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.360]  I want to air a letter where he said that Joe Biden didn't play with a full deck, which
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.560]  is totally true, just riveting important stuff.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:30.960]  But here he is saying we're going to be very strong, act very strong against big tech censorship,
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.680]  but also Hollywood and how they're racist, creating a race war.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:40.360]  And again, Trump knows how to dumb the language down for the average person, but they're trying
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.720]  to cause a race war, Hollywood's owned by China.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.440]  They own like 67% of it.
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:50.520]  That's a number I saw just a week ago, even in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:55.000]  Now they're having Senate reports and intelligence committee reports where they're saying, I
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  covered this on Monday, it was huge.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.280]  In fact, I'm going to get the video from that congressional testimony, folks, that is so
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.280]  critical.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.000]  That's a whole special we should do.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.360]  Admitting that they've infiltrated the media, the colleges, and are trying to overthrow
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.360]  the country.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.360]  This is insane.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:18.480]  When you turn on Netflix, it's chai-com, weaponized, leftist venom.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.440]  Most of the stuff China produces here is banned in China.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:26.520]  There it is, House Intelligence Committee holds open hearing on China's digital authoritarianism.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:31.440]  And they did find the video, they did post it with the article, good job guys.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:35.200]  That was just August 7th, so the testimony is there.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:38.960]  Great job, Kit Daniels, and crew finding that.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.960]  So there it is.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.960]  I mean, go see it for yourself.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:41.960]  I just read the transcript.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.080]  I said, hey guys, post the video.
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.080]  So they did do that.
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.080]  Amazing.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:51.000]  So that's on our bucket list, but here's the president saying that he's taking the gloves
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  off.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  And when he says, I'm taking action.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.600]  He's like, well, we're looking at it, we're asking him to stop, you know, we may have
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600]  to do something.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.600]  He says, no, we're taking strong action.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:05.000]  Hip hip hooray, because Trump does what he says he's doing, or he certainly tries it.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  Here it is.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.200]  We're looking at that right now.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.680]  We have a lot of these companies coming in a little while.
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:18.240]  As you know, we're going to be very tough with them.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.400]  They're treating conservatives very unfairly.
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.800]  Hollywood, I don't call them the elites.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:29.840]  I think the elites are people they go after in many cases, but Hollywood is really terrible.
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.160]  You talk about races, Hollywood is racist.
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:38.200]  What they're doing with the kind of movies they're putting out is actually very dangerous
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.600]  for our country.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:43.080]  What Hollywood is doing is a tremendous disservice to our country.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:49.160]  We have now in a little while all of the heads of the biggest companies coming in, and we're
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.360]  going to talk to them.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:57.360]  They treat conservatives, Republicans, totally different than they treat others.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.680]  They can't do that.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:05.160]  Netflix has two shows out right now that we've been so busy we've mentioned, had articles
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:10.320]  about that haven't even covered, even though it's riveting tyranny, where white people
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:16.000]  are inherently evil and are taken and hunted like animals because they're Trump supporters
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.480]  by white people.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:23.200]  So what's the loving liberal white is teaching the minority how to kill the evil white.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.840]  And now people are running into Walmart saying, I'm going to kill white people, give me weapons
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.560]  to kill 200, and they're white people.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:36.320]  And people are showing up in body armor with assault rifles, as they call them, and this
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.720]  is hysteria, Joe Biggs.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:38.720]  They created hysteria.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.720]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:44.080]  Ryan Shotgun with us in the next hour, got a huge guest joining us on the Epstein situation.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.880]  The lawyer that helped get all these new documents that came out today, but we'll get into your
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:53.280]  huge story that ties into all this, and it's kind of on the ground view of this, which
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.280]  is the most important.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:58.440]  It's one thing to hear about it all, but to be on the ground like we are.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.640]  But we'll get to that next segment.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:01.600]  What would you call this period of time we're in right now?
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.880]  It's a very dark time.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.120]  I mean, it's really a fight of good versus evil.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:11.960]  And evil is kind of making this big rise.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:17.480]  And it's up to us, as good people, as patriots, as Christians, as hard-working Americans,
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.800]  to stand up and face this stuff.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:23.640]  And it's really hard to do that a lot of times when you're getting to platformed and all
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:28.240]  that, but you rise above it, and you go out there, and you look that evil in the eye,
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.840]  and you face him, and you know what, hey, I'm not afraid of you.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.120]  I'm not going to back down, and I'm still going to sit here and show up and stand for
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.120]  what I believe in.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:39.800]  And we'll talk about it next segment, but the FBI is now, the leftist FBI is harassing
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.240]  your family, employers, people you sold houses to, I mean, they're letting you know.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.800]  You leave Antifa alone.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800]  You evil American.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.120]  Well, they told me yesterday, they said, if something happens, that's on you.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.440]  If something happens at this event, it's on you.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.280]  Like if they're pinning this on me, and I haven't done anything, meanwhile.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.840]  The police stand down, we'll talk about it next segment, but the police stand down in
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.800]  Portland, let them attack everybody.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.840]  You just say, hey, as a proud America, I'm going to walk up there and hold my chest high
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:11.480]  and my, my chin high, and then the FBI tells you to stop.
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.480]  Pretty much.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.520]  And it was just, you know, it was Antifa in Ohio killed those 10 people.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.520]  Yep.
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.520]  It's insane.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.520]  Is that on you, Joe?
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.520]  Is that your fault?
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:25.240]  I'm a white Christian male, I'm able-bodied.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:28.440]  So yes, it is my fault, I'm evil.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.640]  I'm a fascist, apparently.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:33.920]  And you know, it's okay because you look on social media or whatever, I don't look at
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.840]  it anymore because I can't see it anymore, but people show me screenshots, hey, we're
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.800]  going to kill fascists, Portland's going to be a bloodbath.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:45.120]  But none of these people are being questioned, none of these people have their accounts taken
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.640]  down, hey, we're going to get slingshots, put ball bearings in them, and aim for Joe
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.640]  Biggs' eyes.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:50.640]  That's like a firearm.
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.640]  Yeah.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:56.040]  We're going to mix compounds and throw it in their face, you know, like, but nothing's
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.040]  happening to them.
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.520]  I'm the one that's being harassed, nonstop by all these law enforcement officials.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:07.680]  And it's hard to trust because you see how deeply embedded Antifa is in so much that
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.760]  it's hard to even trust some of these people when they ask you, what are you going to be
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.520]  doing on the day of the event?
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.520]  Where are you going to be moving?
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.520]  How are you going to do this?
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:17.240]  Because it's turned out there are FBI agents that are Antifa.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.360]  Yeah, it's frightening because you don't even know who you can trust now.
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:23.560]  And this is a group that says they want to kill police.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.560]  They openly say it.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:30.760]  They even put out flyers that say that they were going to siege or assault El Paso and
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:35.280]  it shows pictures of them shooting down at ice agents and dogs and border patrols.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.280]  Killing them.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.280]  Yeah.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280]  Killing them.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280]  Pulls the blood.
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280]  American flag on fire.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:44.240]  But I say I'm coming for Antifa and yeah, I am coming for Antifa.
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.440]  I'm coming to expose them.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.440]  I'm coming to shine a light.
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.440]  That's what you said.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:50.720]  I'm going to go marching and we're going to exercise the First Amendment and if they
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.840]  attack us, we're going to fight back.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.000]  But that's the under the left fighting back is the greatest crime.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.520]  Yeah, I just have to go in.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.520]  I was thinking it'd be funny.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.520]  Hey, Joe.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.320]  I'm not going to slap you in the face.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.320]  You need to take it.
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.320]  I think I'm just going to go in.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.960]  If I'm Antifa, I'm allowed to do whatever I want.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.920]  I'm just going to go in the end in the Portland with handcuffs on or straight jacket.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.680]  Because I can't do anything if I do anything.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:13.680]  I'm screwed.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.320]  Like they're already painting everything on me.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.240]  So I might as well just go in with a straight jacket.
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.240]  That way.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.840]  That's because Antifa are their little their little babies.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:24.520]  I mean, you saw what they did and Twitter allowed it all up of going to Mitch McConnell's
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:25.520]  calling my murder.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.920]  We're going to kill you.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.640]  We're going to stab you with a butcher knife and then Twitter leaves all that up.
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.440]  But when Mitch McConnell tried to respond, they froze his account.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.920]  You talk about that's the leader of the Senate and they stand by it.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:42.320]  Yeah, they're telling the head of the stuff about arrogance.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.600]  Oh, so I saw Mitch McConnell on Fox News this morning.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.560]  He said they're going to break up big tech.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.360]  You guys are arrogant, man.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.360]  Big tech is dumb.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:29:03.840]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now

[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.400]  It is such a revolutionary act every time you put a bumper sticker on your car or paint
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.360]  infowars.com on the side of your barn, every time you stand up to leftist bullies, every
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.760]  time you tell the truth.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:46.080]  Every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive, the enemy comes
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:48.360]  one step closer to their system falling.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.600]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:55.360]  And now we've got a fighting chance if we all take action of defeating the globalist.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.360]  Stay with us.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.360]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.200]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:03.200]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.840]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.160]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:13.600]  about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:16.000]  doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.280]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.280]  shut us down.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:22.680]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.680]  wonderful they were.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.520]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:29.800]  Joan sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:35.080]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.720]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:41.600]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:45.160]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.480]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:50.400]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.080]  God's medicine chest.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:32:19.080]  Time for WarStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:26.600]  That's beautiful.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:29.640]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:33.680]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the world that want to intimidate
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:37.000]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.360]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit and the human spirit lives at infowars.com
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:43.360]  and newswars.com.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:48.440]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:49.560]  the dark of the night.
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.640]  We are the resistance.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:33:01.400]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:14.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:25.400]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:39.640]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:34:01.720]  Again, I'm not complaining, but this is like torture, in a way.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:05.600]  But it's a good torture, but it's a bad torture.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:10.440]  I've got so much riveting incredible news that I don't even know where to start that
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.600]  just shows how the wheels are coming off.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:16.160]  We're getting this video right now.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.640]  It's on infowars.com.
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:19.120]  It's on newswars.com.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.760]  I just saw it during the break.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:21.760]  It's incredible.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.560]  Joe Biden, as the president said, is not playing with a full deck.
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.560]  We're going to get that clip too.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:32.280]  He said that in a speech this morning and you're not kidding.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.580]  He's not playing with a full deck.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:36.960]  The new video is on infowars.com.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:41.600]  Video Joe Biden forcefully grabs young woman during Iowa State Fair.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:46.520]  Presidential frontrunner was asked, how many genders are there?
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:50.120]  And he forcefully grabs her and flips out.
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:54.760]  So that video is up on infowars.com right now, and this is what I'm getting at.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.600]  You know Trump's got intel, opposition research on Biden.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:04.000]  You know Trump's got information because what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.400]  These people are on the chai-com payroll, Biden is, so you know, Trump's legally and
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.000]  lawfully getting everything on Biden.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.240]  Biden's had strokes again, many strokes at least, small ones.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.760]  He doesn't know what planet he's on a good portion of the time.
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:22.480]  He is melting down in live time.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:26.080]  He is melting down in live time.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:33.240]  And so it's going to get weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder.
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:36.320]  So coming up next segment, we're going to have that clip of Trump in the press conference
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.320]  today.
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:41.320]  Come up, Joe Biden says it twice, does not have a full deck, is out of his mind.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.520]  We're going to get into your case and your story because it's so amazing, it's at the
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:48.840]  heart of Antifa, but there's no reason to play this video anymore.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:49.840]  Everyone's seen it.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:55.280]  Finally, Fox News is covering it today, where they go to Mitch McConnell's house and they're
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:00.160]  saying we're going to stab you to death, we're going to kill you, die, and they're all around
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.160]  his house.
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.560]  There are hosts on MSNBC, I even forgot to tell the folks about this clip saying we need
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:12.320]  to have pitchforks and torches and go to the Trump event in the Hamptons today and basically
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.960]  burn down the event.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:18.160]  So the Democrats are saying we want violence.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.680]  Biden's saying I want a physical war.
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:25.480]  There's so many of these clips now, I can't even think of them all, they're daily now.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:29.880]  And then they're telling us that we're white supremacists and we're causing violence.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.200]  And then both these guys have Antifa backgrounds, one of them's a Satanist, and then we're
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:35.800]  getting blamed, Joe Beggs.
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:36.800]  And they're white.
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:41.120]  It's the funniest thing in the world.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:44.320]  There are white people going around calling other people white supremacists and there
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:49.400]  are literally a large group of white people telling people how to think, how to vote,
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.800]  what to say, and then they're the ones that get to determine who's racist and that they're
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:54.800]  all white supremacists.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:55.800]  Well, that's really what it is.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.800]  Everybody's bad but needs what they're saying.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.280]  Democrats can never take responsibility for anything, ever.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.280]  It's always just pushing on someone else.
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.280]  It's not me.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.440]  Well, that's why I'm Information Overlord.
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:12.000]  I even forgot to tell the producers this morning, I'm watching Fox News and they've got Congressman
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.880]  Scalise on and they're just playing an MSNBC clip where the host is saying it's time to
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:21.880]  get pitched forks and torches and go physically attack the Trump event.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:26.120]  I mean, but oh, I guarantee the FBI's not going to talk to him, they're going to come
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.120]  talk to you.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:29.920]  Oh yeah, I've gotten threats, I even sent it to them where they're saying they want
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920]  to burn down my house.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.880]  They're like, oh yeah, I guess Joe won't be at his Florida house on August 17th, he'll
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:40.080]  be in Portland and then everyone's like, oh, maybe we should go out there and burn it down.
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:44.480]  But that's okay, that's fine when those kind of comments are being made on social media.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:45.480]  That's okay.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:48.120]  Let's not do anything about that.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:52.160]  Let's worry about old Joe Biggs out here because he says he's going after Antifa.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:59.000]  Yeah, I would expose the hell out of you freaking commie bastards and they're frightened, they're
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  flipping out.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.680]  I mean, they're literally scared, Ted Wheeler, my phone's blowing up right now, the mayor
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:07.600]  of Portland just did like a press release talking about my event and they're just, they're
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:11.400]  scared, they're out of their minds, they think that we're going to come out here and create
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.720]  all this mass havoc and we've done nothing from the get go.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.280]  What they're hoping is this other Charlottesville.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:20.000]  Yeah, that's exactly what they want, they want the headlines, they want those clips,
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.760]  they want to be able to use that again, by the way, all you did is what Joey Gibson
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.480]  and others have done when Andy becomes out in the tax, conservative rallies, Christian
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.200]  marches, then those guys would go out and you've been part of that.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.720]  And I've done some of that here as well.
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:39.160]  And we just go out and cover it because Antifa is trying to stop people having free speech.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.200]  We're not the ones initiating it.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:44.880]  We're just exercising our rights because if you don't exercise them, you lose them.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:49.080]  Like black folks in the 50s or 60s saying, I'm going to go vote.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.960]  And then people are trying to keep them from voting.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.600]  That's another form of speech.
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.560]  The Associated Press called me yesterday, I've done nothing but interviews like ten
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.960]  times a day.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:01.320]  And this lady from the Associated Press called me yesterday, she's like, but you said that
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:04.760]  you told Antifa and one of your periscopes that they should be watching over their shoulders
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:05.760]  everywhere they go.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.400]  I said, well, so did Nancy Pelosi and so did Maxine Waters.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.320]  They said that Trump supporters should look over their back and they shouldn't feel safe
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:13.480]  when they go out in public.
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:17.800]  I said, I don't want Antifa, which is a domestic terrorist organization, to feel safe.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:19.360]  There should be anti-masking laws.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.720]  They should look over their shoulder every time they think of donning that mask and going
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.240]  out and committing acts of violence.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:27.140]  They should look over their shoulder because they're the ones doing wrong.
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:28.640]  We just want to expose that.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.280]  Let me guess, AP didn't quote that.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.280]  Oh no.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:35.720]  Man, I've talked to the New York Times and stuff.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:37.240]  They will make up quotes.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.760]  Oh, they say I'm a renowned Florida radio talk show host.
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.080]  I'm like, I've never even done talk radio in Florida.
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:46.960]  I was like, this is my point of people.
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:47.960]  Let's see.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:48.960]  This is how fake it is.
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:49.960]  I was like, they just make things up.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:53.760]  Oh, they said that I wrote a book about Sandy Hook called Sandy Hook.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:57.600]  No one doubted Sandy Hook and that I lost a lawsuit about it.
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:58.600]  And I've never read the book.
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.040]  I'm not in the book.
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.960]  It's Professor Fetcher's on the cover.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:07.760]  And I had lawyers, like real lawyers call AP and they said, we stand by that it's your
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:08.760]  book.
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:09.760]  So we're filing suit.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:15.040]  I've got to pull the trigger next week that we're looking to sue AP because we've written
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.040]  letters.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:20.240]  You know, you wrote this book and you lost a suit and I'm just like, you don't, no,
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.240]  we don't care.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.560]  They just, they get to create the truth.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.880]  Well, it's like somebody sends coded child porn.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:27.880]  It's in code.
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:28.880]  It's not even on the page.
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:29.880]  Yeah.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:30.880]  It's hidden in the code.
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:34.000]  You know, like Al Qaeda would send like, you know, like, like, like codes on like a
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.920]  piece of paper, but it says one thing, but there's code in it.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:42.040]  So somebody, right when we get sued last year, sends us stuff with Sandy Hook on the title
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.320]  with hidden coded child porn, supposedly.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:49.920]  When we get subpoenaed by these Democrat lawyers, they scan it, spend hundreds of thousands
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.680]  of dollars scanning it for hidden code, find the hidden code magically.
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.880]  And then I've sent child porn to the Sandy Hook family.
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.880]  How would you even know to look for that?
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.640]  Well, I mean, again, obviously everybody sees through it.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.640]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:08.320]  Oh, by the way, guys, we were going to have to lay some people off.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.840]  We were behind financially until you did that.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:14.880]  When they pulled that, and it was in every newspaper that I sent child porn to children
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.160]  and then people went and looked and found that none of it was true.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.560]  Support went up massively.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:20.800]  We're still not doing great.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.800]  But I mean, that, my point is, Joe, they're going too far.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.880]  They just keep pushing and pushing and pushing.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.880]  But there's still no outcry, though, from the public.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:34.280]  I mean, look at Laura Loomer being banned, you, me, Milo, Gavin, and no one says anything.
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:35.280]  They don't care.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.280]  And then it's going to be them.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:42.800]  And then 200 million accounts that were following Facebook and Twitter meme sites that were all
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.240]  sorts of funny stuff, but also a lot of Trump stuff, they all just got deleted a few weeks
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.240]  ago.
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:48.800]  Well, Trump finally got upset about that.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.920]  Because again, not letting people follow something is not letting them see something.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.600]  So everybody keeps thinking about who's being deleted.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.640]  Well, what about the people that were following that?
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:03.560]  They were fans, 200 plus million followers, not allowed to see what they wanted to see.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.600]  That's like coming into your house and saying, give me the remote control, Joe.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.000]  You can't see what you want to see.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.920]  That's fundamentally evil.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:14.760]  That's amazing what they're doing and what they're getting away with, and you're still
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:17.760]  not seeing people in the streets yelling and screaming.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:20.160]  I mean, you would think that there'd be mass anger.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:21.280]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.640]  The reason they picked me first, they demonized me for a year with major artillery.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:30.200]  Then when they banned me, they knew others would try to hide, hoping they wouldn't be
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.200]  next.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:33.000]  It's that process like schools of fish.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.200]  And so once you spoke out, others did, but once, once most people ran for the hills,
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.200]  they went good.
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:42.400]  But now it's Mitch McConnell getting banned on Twitter.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.680]  See, it's a test.
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:47.960]  What will you shmucks put up with at the leadership of the Republican Party?
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:50.800]  What won't you put up with dumbasses?
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.480]  Listen to Matt Drudge.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:54.920]  Listen to Tucker Carlson.
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:55.920]  Listen to me.
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.720]  We've been right.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.160]  If you want to bet on your future, if you want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:06.480]  on not being run by the chai comms with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:10.000]  fund the Democrats and MSM and CNN, the Chinese government does.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  It's all coming out.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  Democrats aren't going to stop.
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.360]  They're trying to cause a civil war right now.
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.640]  Like we're starting to get some purchase, trying to start a fire.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.640]  They got some fire going.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.880]  All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ice facilities getting attacked, dead people
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:21.880]  everywhere.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:22.880]  It's on folks.
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:25.960]  And if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's going to go insane.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:29.480]  So now more than you've ever done for yourself, for me, for everybody, spread the word about
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.840]  this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV, tell folks about info wars.com, four slash
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.840]  show.

[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:57.280]  against the devil worshiping Satanist and their off-world controllers.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.440]  The globalists are hyper-competitive, scientific dictators.
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.520]  They are technocrats.
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:06.280]  They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.840]  own life and make your own decisions hits are the way of their great destiny to merge
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:11.840]  with AI gods.
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.040]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:17.680]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest places
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:22.960]  that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:28.240]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from the fourslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:32.600]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high-quality
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:38.320]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.200]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.200]  to find anywhere.
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.200]  It is amazing.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:50.600]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:45:00.360]  the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple-A-253-3139.

[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:03.080]  George R. Wells said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.080]  act.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.760]  And so, it used to, it wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we still
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:11.320]  loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:15.520]  But now, they're trying to take it out of schools, they're taking it down off of government
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.520]  buildings.
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:20.440]  Weird white leftist that won a versus singular, pulling down American flags and running up
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.040]  Mexican flags.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:24.880]  This is the bizarreness of the America-hating we're seeing.
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:29.440]  So now, it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:35.080]  to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:40.960]  when it says on the back, right there, ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowars.com.
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:45.720]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies'
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:49.760]  face, all over, not just the U.S., but worldwide, because more than ever, the American flag
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:47:14.760]  is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:28.480]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.680]  Thank you, audience, for your support.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:32.880]  Thank you to this crew for the great job they do.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.440]  The best crew I've ever worked with.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.440]  They're amazing.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.880]  We have righted shut down with the show Biggs right into the next hour.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.040]  Mark Rondaza was traveling and dealing with some family stuff, but he's a big lawyer,
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.600]  doesn't work for us.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.440]  He was involved in lawsuits to bring out the Epstein stuff.
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:57.880]  They got the treasure trove of documents that totally absolves Trump, but just absolutely
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:01.640]  devastates a bunch of leftists.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:07.840]  And so that story is up on infowars.com, big exclusive Epstein news at infowars.com.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:10.520]  Somebody reprint me the infowars.com article, thanks.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.120]  So he's going to be popping in with us as well.
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.400]  Let me just take some time out to remind listeners that without your support, we won't be here.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:26.800]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.440]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:30.440]  I want to take the globalist on.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:31.440]  I don't want to.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:32.840]  Don't comb my hair in the bathroom.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:33.840]  I'm breaking.
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:34.840]  Just do it here on air.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  That's how I do it, folks.
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:36.840]  No makeup.
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.160]  No, no, no, nothing around here.
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:42.080]  But then I'm like sitting here on air, looking at my hair sticking up, got to fix it.
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.160]  Every transparency is our whole operation, and I want to follow some lawsuits.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:48.760]  In fact, I've said I'm going to do it, so I'm going to do it.
[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:51.400]  And Robert Barnes is doing it at cost.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.560]  I've got Norm Pattis ready to do it at cost.
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.840]  And I've got some other law firms ready.
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:58.680]  And we are writing reports up and advising the president.
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.000]  I'm not trying to brag about that, but we've been sending information to the president.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.440]  And the folks at our contacts have said, that's good.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:07.440]  Please send more.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:10.600]  And our contacts are like, hey, what do you want the president to tweet about infowars?
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:15.680]  I mean, so we're obviously to the dread of the globalists have made your contacts there
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:19.960]  because our listeners, you are the base of the Trump operation.
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:25.320]  So you get the credit, but I'm literally in here during the break with the accountants
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:35.600]  coming in here saying, OK, are you ready to pay the initial amounts of money for these
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.760]  lawsuits and the research that's been done for them, just for the law clerks and people?
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:42.560]  And it's still at cost.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:50.280]  You know, we're talking $20,000 a pop was $20,000 to file my Supreme Court brief, even
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:55.680]  though they said they would hear my case out of Connecticut and made neutralize the case
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:50:01.600]  while it's even beginning that that's that's like one in 5000.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.600]  And we're probably going to win that.
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:03.600]  That was $20,000.
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:04.880]  And that was at cost.
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:07.400]  They had over 10 lawyers involved in that.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:10.760]  One of the best legal work reportedly that some folks have ever seen.
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:13.320]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.920]  But there's just a lot of the war's cost of money.
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:20.480]  I'm explain this box.
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:26.880]  This is this globalist funded NBC controlled system only has a few hundred employees.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:30.400]  They get $250 million a year.
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.480]  And that means million.
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:38.720]  Vibrating in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:40.920]  stuff up that much.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:44.880]  And then there's all the employees and fees and fines and paying all our own stuff and
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.880]  legal.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:49.280]  And I don't care if I'm not making money.
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:55.120]  But if I'm not making money, it means I'm close to death.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.400]  So I used to like not want to, I wish back when the, you know, you make hay while the
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:03.960]  sun shines, I wish back in the day when I could make bringing so much money that I'd
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:09.480]  have been on the air more because I would have had a bunch of nuts put away for winter.
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:14.800]  This squirrel didn't keep very many nuts behind, but used to I kept five or six nuts.
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.640]  Most girls will keep a hundred nuts, but I'd five or six nuts because I wanted to put
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:20.440]  every bit of energy into this.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.000]  I don't have any more nuts left except once in my legs.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.840]  And it's just, I can't tell you how great it is what you've done, but you need to buy
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:29.840]  the products.
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:30.840]  We got coffee.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:31.840]  We got fish oil.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.840]  We got turmeric.
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:33.840]  We got great toothpaste.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:37.800]  We've got great things like DNA force plus.
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:40.400]  We have the banniversary sale, but here's, here's what we're really excited about.
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:41.720]  We'll go back to Joe Bix.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:46.120]  Now he's been totally had his website, bank accounts, this guy's, you know, we built
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:47.120]  info wars.
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:48.360]  He's had it all taken away.
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:50.320]  People will better stay away from that.
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.600]  No, you're next.
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:56.680]  But ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months for whatever reason.
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.360]  This became the most popular fish oil.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:02.520]  We have fish oil, children's fish oil and ultimate krill oil.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:07.800]  It's totally full of the bottle and it is the strongest, purest fish oil, krill oil.
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:12.900]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory
[01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:16.080]  process to remove mercury.
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:18.800]  Now krill are already little bitty, so there's not a lot of mercury in them.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:23.840]  But the point is any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:27.320]  I don't like, but gives you all the, all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:30.080]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:31.080]  This has not been.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:37.400]  We went to one of the top firms in the world that private labels fish oil and krill oil.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:40.240]  And we said, we want the best you make, period.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:44.120]  And they're like, well, this is medical stuff that's sold in medical clinics for $100 a
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:45.120]  bottle.
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:47.960]  So when we're normally selling it for 50 bucks, it's a good deal because those places
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.880]  are marking them up three times.
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:55.120]  But when it's discounted right now, 50% off, despite the fact that it's been sold out,
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:57.400]  give me a document cam shot real quick, please.
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:02.000]  I want to show people this krill oil, because it's just, it's literally, I'm strong enough,
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.800]  big, big strong man, you got to open this for me, see that?
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:12.280]  Looks like the pickle jar came and opened, but Hillary could.
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:18.840]  This ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.080]  That's what my doctor keeps telling me I need to start taking.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:27.920]  Oh, yeah, that's what they, the drug companies are trying to patent it so that no one else
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:28.920]  can sell it.
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:32.480]  Because it's so, I mean, this, this is thermonuclear right here.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:33.480]  It's red.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:35.720]  This is real krill oil folks is red.
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.720]  It's not yellow.
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.520]  It's not milky.
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.760]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:47.840]  And let me tell you, this stuff, oh my God, you want to have some dreams?
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:48.840]  Take two.
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:49.840]  What's your doctor telling you?
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:55.160]  Well, I'm going to start taking a human growth hormone replacement for some of the injuries
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.160]  I have.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:54:00.320]  And that's one of the things that the doctor wants to prescribe me or give me is to start
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:03.920]  taking stuff like that, because that would help with the testosterone in my body and
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:07.200]  all that stuff when I'm working out and help with my tendons and just my,
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:08.200]  Exactly.
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.320]  Because even if you take the growth hormone, if you don't have this, it doesn't have the
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:11.560]  building blocks to use it.
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:12.560]  Yeah.
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:15.200]  And by the way, I'm not hyping this folks.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:19.160]  This is the best krill oil we could find.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:20.160]  This is the best.
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:22.760]  I can't even just look at that.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:28.440]  Nobody's, it's supposed to be red folks, because that's the essence of the krill.
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:35.160]  I mean, it's probably like a hundred krill going to each one of these.
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:39.320]  So you want it, you got it, it's back in stock, I'm going to stop talking about it.
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:45.400]  And again, I'm not going to call this a drug because drugs are a ripoff of what God made.
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:50.520]  You take two of these before you go to bed at night and I would, I would do it with your
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:52.920]  dinner if you don't want to get fish burps.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:58.320]  Because again, they've got the fish oil and stuff, oh, this doesn't have the fish flavor
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:00.080]  because they boiled the hell out of it.
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:02.240]  It isn't, it isn't there anymore folks.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.680]  You got to deal with the fish burps because this stuff's powerful.
[01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:05.680]  Just look at that.
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:08.280]  I mean, that is, I don't know if the camera can pick up guys.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.400]  Can the camera just drop some on the ground?
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:14.640]  Can the camera pick up just how pretty those are?
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:15.640]  I don't know.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:16.640]  I'm ranting.
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.080]  Joe Biggs, I apologize for running over here.
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.080]  You're here with us.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:23.880]  Tell, tell folks about your deplatforming, but, but, but we're going to that, but also
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:28.040]  what's coming up in Portland, the date and why they're so scared of this.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:34.480]  Well, the deplatforming happened when we kind of started going after Antifa.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:38.360]  We saw the attack on Andy Ngo and the other two guys that were out there at that event
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:39.360]  in Portland.
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:43.440]  And a lot of, like me and a lot of other people in America, you know, we got mad, you know,
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:48.520]  and kind of, I called a bunch of my friends, I said, we need to do something about this.
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:51.800]  And I got with Enrique Tario, the head of the proud boys.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:53.280]  And he goes, yeah, I think it's a good idea.
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.280]  Let's do an event.
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:59.080]  Let's go back to Portland and let's bring aware, you know, bring awareness, national
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:00.080]  attention to Antifa.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:03.320]  And he goes, we just got to come up with a name for, and I said, well, let's do end
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:04.320]  domestic terrorism.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.200]  You know, so we decided right here on the phone call, we put it together.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:14.720]  And ever since then, it has been a roller coaster, you know, Twitter took me down, Facebook,
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:18.840]  Instagram, everything, you know, it's websites going down.
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:22.280]  You know, I remember when I saw you shed, we're going to have a march and stand up to
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:23.280]  them.
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:24.280]  We're not going to attack them or they attack us.
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:25.280]  We'll fight back.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:29.800]  And I said, bitch is banned because you don't touch those little, little babies.
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:33.480]  It's amazing how much they protect those guys and they allow them to get away with so much
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:34.480]  stuff.
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:38.880]  And you sit here and you look, I go back and I'm looking at the things I said.
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:43.240]  And I go, some of them could be a little inflammatory, a little heated because I was emotional.
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:46.240]  You know, like most people I turned on TV, I'm watching Fox News or whatever.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:51.000]  And I see this guy by himself being outnumbered and kicked and beaten on the ground.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.280]  And then the next day you find out the guy's got a brain bleed.
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.320]  And I'm sitting here going, this is my country.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:57.880]  Why is this happening here?
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:00.760]  And no one's doing anything law enforcement sitting there.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:05.720]  Ted Wheeler, the mayor is like, well, you know, sorry.
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:09.160]  You know, so at some point in time, like we have to, we have to face it.
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.400]  We have to bring awareness to it.
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:12.400]  We have to say something.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:16.560]  Well, see, Andy's, Andy was supposed to ignite everyone else for an uprising.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:18.760]  They keep, they want to overthrow the government.
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:20.480]  And a lot of the parts of the government are leftist.
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:22.000]  They want to position in that government.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  Yeah.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.080]  See, that's the kind of the lottery ticket the left things are going to get.
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:28.920]  Let me tell the left, you successfully kick off a civil war.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:30.680]  All you're going to get is six feet under.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:31.680]  And that's not a threat.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:32.680]  It's a promise.
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:37.160]  If you have a communist civil war in this country, you are guaranteed to be going to
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.960]  the bottom of the Davy Jones locker because the devil and the deep blue sea are two different
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:43.960]  things.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:47.040]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.680]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:50.840]  I love tuning in to Owen Troyer.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:55.280]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you, we run during the
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:58:00.160]  breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads show.
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:01.520]  You think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:04.760]  I don't want to hear an ad, but here's the bottom line.
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:08.800]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract.
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:10.040]  I don't want them to win.
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:12.960]  So listen, you've got this guarantee for me.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:17.520]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:19.280]  give the globalists a run for their money.
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:23.800]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2, these will change
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:24.800]  your life.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:28.080]  Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration, check
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.080]  it all out.
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:32.440]  You take action and know, be part of the second American Revolution.
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:35.680]  Be part of Crush the Globalist and get great products at the same time.
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.120]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:40.160]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:49.360]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:56.720]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:10.360]  Infowars is a digital, AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or Infowars.com.
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:12.040]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:13.280]  This is racketeering.
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:14.280]  This is cartels.
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:16.760]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:18.680]  We need it now.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:20.320]  You can take on Big Tech.
[01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:27.680]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:29.280]  populist organization.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:34.000]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.160]  The way to fight back is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:44.000]  of freedom and free speech.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:51.840]  Again, they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[01:59:51.840 --> 02:00:17.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:26.000]  This is one reason I'm so overwhelmed and that press conference today was so incredible
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.400]  with the president and I've got so many other clips I haven't gotten to and then there's
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:33.160]  all this other news.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:40.560]  It's just insane, but gigantic Jeffrey Epstein news, they've got multiple lawsuits out, Mark
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:48.680]  Rondaza and journalist Mike Cernovich and so they just got the treasure trove of documents
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:50.680]  and it completely exonerates the president.
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:54.960]  In fact, guys, I had that article that Kit Daniels brought me and I'm having trouble
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:55.960]  finding it.
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:58.280]  You guys, reprint that for me and bring it back in.
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:59.280]  Thank you.
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:03.640]  It's on Infowars.com and you're going to get some exclusive information here with Mark
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:10.540]  Rondaza as well, but again, Epstein accuser Trump didn't partake in any sex with us and
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:15.400]  he never flirted with me.
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:19.920]  Though the media has been saying that Trump supposedly had sex with this person, Trump
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:21.320]  is a control freak.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.320]  He would never.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:26.760]  I know the inside baseball on Trump and I'm not going to put it out here, but I know a
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:30.640]  lot of stuff people don't know from Roger Stone, but also others and Roger never steered me
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:32.200]  wrong.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:34.520]  Trump had to get over the anxiety of shaking people's hands.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:39.080]  I think it's like people, he loves them, but he's a germ freak so he had to literally
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:40.520]  make himself get used to it.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:44.800]  Now he doesn't care, but he doesn't just have sex with women like on the third or fourth
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:45.800]  day.
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:48.400]  That's why so much of that Stormy Daniels thing isn't even true either.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:52.880]  I mean, Trump like literally wants like STD tests.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.720]  He would only do it when he was not married.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:56.600]  When he wasn't married, he was out with women every day.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:01.080]  He loves women, but the idea that he'd be in Russia being pissed on is not true, Joe.
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:03.000]  Yeah, but I mean, it's in the news.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  So it has to be true.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.680]  I mean, I'm also a Florida talk show radio host.
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:13.480]  I mean, it is, I mean, they could create whatever they want, whatever narrative they want,
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:14.480]  whatever truth.
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:15.480]  And that's why it's funny.
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:20.480]  You always start, I keep hearing this term used all the time, your truth, your truth,
[02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:21.480]  the left.
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:22.480]  That's what Biden said.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:23.480]  Yeah, have you heard that?
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:24.480]  He said, our truth trumps facts.
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:25.480]  Yeah.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:26.480]  And they're all saying that.
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:27.480]  Listen, the Cory Booker says it.
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:29.840]  Kamala Harris, they all keep saying, I've been like.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:30.840]  That's cult programming.
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:31.840]  Yeah.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.720]  When, when they tell you, don't worry about facts.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:34.720]  It's your truth.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:35.720]  Yeah.
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:36.720]  What's your story?
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:37.720]  Believe all women.
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:39.360]  It's your truth that you're speaking.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:42.640]  So I can just completely make up a story and that's my truth.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:45.960]  And since it's my truth, therefore it shall be true.
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:49.600]  Since he mentions that, guys, can you queue up Biden?
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:55.640]  We'll play that in a minute, saying that our truth trumps facts.
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:56.640]  Yeah.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:59.640]  That's like Wiley Coyote runs out over the edge of the cliff and he figures it out and
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:00.640]  he falls.
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:04.320]  But no, no, no, according to that of Wiley Coyote, Wiley Coyote walks out there and just
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.240]  says, my truth trumps facts.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:13.840]  Well, he just, he float in just a bridge just creates, he just, okay, here's, here's, here's
[02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:14.840]  Biden.
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:19.920]  What he knows who Donald Trump is, even the supporters know who he is.
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.840]  We got to let him know who we are.
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.840]  We choose unity over division.
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:25.920]  We choose science over fiction.
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:28.040]  We choose truth over facts.
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:29.040]  Yeah.
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:34.240]  If you're interested, join me, I could use the help.
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:37.200]  We've got to add to this in post as we're live right now, but just when we put this clip
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:42.680]  out, can we edit it down to two minutes and maybe put Wiley Coyote when he runs out and
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:47.000]  he figures it out and he goes, drops, but yeah, you got to listen and listen to these
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  guys carefully.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.240]  I've noticed a lot of them been saying that they're all say your truth Oprah's even saying
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:55.880]  it now Oprah's been saying on some of her stuff.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:58.280]  She goes, oh, we just have to believe your truth.
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:03:59.280]  It's your truth.
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:01.280]  It's your story.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:04.440]  It's a magical thing.
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:09.720]  Well, your truth doesn't, you don't get your truth and I don't get your truth.
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:10.960]  Your truth doesn't exist for us.
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:14.960]  So I don't want to do this, but if I got up and smashed say this bottle over your head
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:18.680]  and I said, I didn't hit you, Joe, it's my truth, but that's what the left does now.
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:20.560]  They're like all calling for violence.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:23.840]  And then they say we're calling for violence and we're not just do it after the Portland
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:24.840]  rally.
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:25.840]  I still need to go do that.
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:26.840]  I don't want to.
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:27.840]  It's a figure of speech.
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:28.840]  I know.
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:32.560]  I just keep wanting to make the analogy of like I punch you in the arm and go, you punch
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:33.960]  me bad and go, Hey, you just assaulted me.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:34.960]  That's what the left always does.
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:37.360]  Like, did you see where they hit somebody and they get punched back and they call the
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.360]  cop?
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:39.360]  Yes.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:40.360]  That's what I was telling the FBI yesterday.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:41.360]  I said, it's amazing.
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:42.360]  Nothing's getting done.
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:48.480]  I said, they'll literally go in and hit somebody and then run away and say that they were assaulted.
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.640]  Well, it's, it's, it's your truth.
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:52.640]  They were trying to kill us in DC.
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:56.920]  They were attacking our cab with the thorns.
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:00.840]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:05.360]  The other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.600]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:12.720]  That's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:18.320]  It is completely independent of all that it is an old school, American 1776 style experiment
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:22.280]  in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact, the founders
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:25.920]  were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:30.200]  and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:33.720]  and that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:37.720]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:42.280]  what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:47.120]  audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:51.000]  age ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:58.000]  onslaught of the platforming defamation, lawfare and libel targeting you.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:30.200]  Okay, Mark Vandazza has only got two segments with us because he's got a lot of important
[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:35.600]  work to get to but after he leaves us we have time I'm going to air premiere some of the
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:41.400]  audio of his closing arguments on this will the top first amendment lawyers out there
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:46.120]  in a skype's been going in and out so we're getting him back on right now if not just
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:53.280]  get him on phone that Jeffrey Epstein large tranche of files released in the Maxwell suit
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:59.400]  that was a reported British intelligence pimp that was working with Epstein there's a big
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:05.160]  article up on info wars dot com how this totally absolves Trump and how the witnesses in the
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:09.320]  actual suit and the documents that the Democrats didn't want released said that Trump was never
[02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:14.040]  involved never saw Trump Trump never did anything never tried to have sex with anybody but there's
[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:19.400]  a lot more there and let me tell you this is just the first news in the Guardian.
[02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:26.200]  This is just the first information that we're trying to process they just got this yesterday
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:34.640]  so Mark Vandazza who's a lawyer that did this with Mike Sernovich joins us now to explain
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:39.440]  how big this is but also what else is about to come out because I know this tranche you
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:43.640]  were telling me this morning is just 50 times bigger than everything else you've gotten it
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:49.800]  just tons of material so Mark thanks for joining us yeah it's my pleasure looks like you're
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:56.040]  in a nice spot where are you I'm in a undisclosed location in New England all right brother
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:08:00.840]  well get into this this is huge and maybe do the backstory of you and Sernovich's lawsuits
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:08.680]  why you did it yeah well what was going on is there was a civil suit between Mr. Frey
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:16.520]  who's claimed that Epstein and Giselaen Maxwell sexually abused her sex trafficked her you
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:20.440]  know we take I take no position on whether that's true whether it's not what happened
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:27.960]  what didn't but what struck Michael and I as very strange is that all of the court documents
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:32.520]  were sealed the summary judgment documents were sealed and that's just not permissible
[02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:38.120]  under the First Amendment or under the common law those courts don't belong to the parties
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:43.480]  those courts belong to us so we get to see when a judge is making a decision what they're
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:51.640]  basing that decision on for some reason this judge let the parties decide for themselves
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:56.360]  what was going to be public and what wasn't going to be public and that's simply improper
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:03.640]  so Michael retained me to intervene in the case as with him as a member of the media
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:11.160]  saying hey it's about time we take a look now what we found really strange was this is going on in
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:19.000]  the New York Times backyard in fact none of the mainstream press was anywhere to be seen until
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:28.280]  play you know mark as nice as your background is it comes in and out I think it's a skype issue
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:32.520]  we're calling on the phone right now you'll be back in two minutes with us this is such a big
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:37.240]  deal here because we keep hearing Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump but there's nothing there
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:41.320]  there was anything there I would not be you know supporting Trump but all you have is the Clintons
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:49.960]  and all these other Hollywood people and CNN executives on this airplane with the initials
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:54.120]  that's illegal by the way with the planes flying around especially out of the country
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:57.880]  to just put initials but they did it because it's children so they have full names William
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:02.600]  Jefferson Clinton Hillary Rodham Clinton but then these initials well these are 13 14 year old girls
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:12.440]  that's insane I have a kid so you know I that just infuriates me to even think of how a human
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:19.560]  being could even think of doing something like that well they had New York Times articles going
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:25.480]  it's normal to be attracted to 12 and 13 year olds no it's not no it's not yeah but if I say I want
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:29.160]  to kick that guy in the head who did something like that then I'm the bad guy then the FBI's
[02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:34.520]  gonna come knocking on my door let's let let's let Timmy and little you know Issa Morel to stay
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:39.480]  over there and play you know he's 50 and he's she's 12 but you're bad if you say that you want to
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:44.200]  kick that guy in the head what do you think of this whole rollout of the pro pedophilia stuff from
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:50.600]  vice and from the New York Times and and just from basically hundreds of love publications
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:54.760]  everywhere are just just saying it's wonderful I remember when I first started working here we
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:11:00.040]  used to kind of joke that it was going to be LGBT what P or whatever they're going to put in pedophilia
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.600]  at some point in time and they're going to try to normalize it and here you you literally get on
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:09.480]  drudge or you get on something and that they're pushing it on all these publications the drag
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:17.320]  queen story time the all this stuff who it's okay love is ageless and all this stuff no it's not
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:22.120]  yet if your kid wants to date a 45 year old when they're 10 it's okay it's up to them totally sick
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:26.520]  we've got mark renda's a constitutional lawyer back filed this suit and then and then now you've
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:33.640]  got even more information so so so what's in this new tranche of information look I haven't even begun
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:40.760]  going through it yet but I've I have seen at least one party that's gone through it zero
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:47.320]  hedge had a story on it saying that these claims that the claims that some of the press has been
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:56.040]  pushing that trump was involved seem to be debunked by this document drop so that's that's at least
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:01.480]  one bit of information that's come out there's also there's an accusation in there remember
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:08.840]  none of this stuff is proven this is a lot of this is just accusations that mr fray made
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:14.760]  maybe the true maybe they're not but about members of the british royal family so there
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:19.400]  is a lot to go through there and I don't want to do it a disservice by digesting it right now
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:28.360]  but what I will say is it's a great day for the first amendment when a previously sealed case
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:34.200]  something that was trying you know where the parties in the court I really don't understand
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:39.960]  what anybody I understand why the parties wanted to do it I mean the parties really would prefer
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:46.120]  in most cases to do things out of the site of the public so I can't really blame them for
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:53.480]  wanting to do that I do think that the the court made a grave error when it acquiesced to their
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:13:00.280]  wishes and I'm really happy that the second circuit has finally said enough's enough we're
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:06.520]  not putting up with this anymore let the people see what's going on because the best way to show
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:11.400]  that you have a free and open court system is to invite the public in to see for themselves
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:18.040]  well I'm just really excited to see all of this because a lot of times people who use non-disclosures
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:23.960]  or they'll use sealed cases to then make stuff up behind that curtain and so some had said well
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:32.040]  Sarnovich and Rondaza they're acting in the media like they sued Epstein to get documents
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:38.280]  that have now kind of triggered a big firestorm of news but they just were suing to get documents
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:43.800]  from another suit well there's different ways to skin a cat I mean it doesn't matter how you get
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:48.920]  the documents to find out the truth it just matters that you get the documents I don't understand
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:55.400]  how that becomes like the story out there but this would never this is not the kind of thing that
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:14:01.960]  an independent journalist like like Sarnovich or you know or even you at at any point in the past
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:09.640]  in the near past this would never have happened when you had a responsible and involved mainstream
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:15.160]  media that you could trust but this just never would happen you're right but they've created a
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:21.160]  vacuum where investigative journalism ever since ABC won the pink slime suit mainstream media just
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:26.600]  ended investigative journalism you know for the most part I mean I wouldn't say that about the
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:31.240]  Miami Herald at this point the Miami Herald showed up and did its job no exactly there's
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:38.120]  still a few of those yeah I mean hell the LA Times the New York Times even even you know
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:42.200]  10 years ago admitted that the FBI was cooking up most of the fake terror things now they wouldn't
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:49.160]  do any of that yeah I mean the New York Times was asleep at the switch on this and I think
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:55.400]  was willingly complicit in keeping it under wraps why I don't know you know we can we can
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:15:00.680]  certainly speculate but I just can't you know when I went to journalism school and I learned
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:06.200]  that the New York Times was really the you know it was the paper of record these were the ones
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:13.960]  who came out and fought for the Pentagon Papers you know that legacy is dead because when you
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:21.640]  don't even see the New York Times showing up for a case like this in their own backyard oh
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:26.200]  that's another angle do one more segment with us because there's no coverage of this hardly I mean
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:30.920]  you you you're breaking bombshell information and share the Guardian did a story I mean there's
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:36.600]  some stuff this should be one of the top stories in the country one would think one would think
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:42.200]  but not today well you didn't implicate Trump because if you know if you made up that it was
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:47.400]  in the documents that Trump you know raped this girl you'd be on you know every channel let's
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:50.440]  come back Joe because you jump and give us your take on this you've experienced mainstream

[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:21.000]  is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.720]  because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:29.800]  than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:34.520]  unbelievable if you didn't know the flood waters backstory so here's what you should do right now

[02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:26.760]  before you slip into unconsciousness i'd like to have another kiss another flashing
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:35.400]  chance well i'm just completely blown away today by president trump coming out saying he's going
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:40.520]  to take strong action against big tech soon and hollywood trying to cause a race for that was
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:45.000]  beautiful i guess i'm over the first amendment and these companies have their quote right to do
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.720]  things but not have fake terms of service not lie about how they're censoring when we have all the
[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:55.560]  executive saying and doing it mark randals i want to get back into this huge release and this this
[02:20:55.560 --> 02:21:03.000]  lawsuit and this huge data dump you just got into the epstein case that's so big but before we do
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.640]  that what do you make of trump coming out this morning saying no he's decided he's going to take
[02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:13.160]  strong action against big tech i know it's still on the drawing board and they're debating hotly
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:17.240]  which plan they're going to go with i know you helped write up some reports i got another major
[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:22.120]  dc firm to write up reports i had a texas firm write up reports had a los angeles firm write up
[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:28.360]  reports we got those the president matt drudge got our emergency report to trump to take action
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:32.680]  by trying to take credit the fact is trumps responsive to his base is what's interesting
[02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:37.000]  and not to lobbyists that's what's so amazing and why they're so scared of him but
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:42.360]  what do you make of this move now and uh what are you hoping trump does what's the most constitutional
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:47.320]  smart avenue to rein in the election meddling of big tech and they're stomping on our free speech
[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:54.040]  uh areas you know i first of all i say it's about time you know he's been he's been in
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:22:00.360]  office for nearly three years now and and it's nice to see this finally happening i think
[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:09.960]  constitutionally he could certainly by executive order say that no government agencies should be
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:16.520]  doing business with companies that do not respect freedom of expression as a neutral platform
[02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:21.720]  you know he can't command that they let people on if uh you know twitter wants to kick somebody off
[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:27.560]  and you can't just say well i'm by executive order i'm going to make you let him back on
[02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:34.360]  but what he can say is all the government agencies that have twitter accounts should cancel them
[02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:40.440]  today um he can say that he is not going to i mean a big move for him would be for him to get
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:45.480]  off twitter and move to a competing platform well i think it's a hint whenever his son
[02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:52.680]  came out and promoted gab yesterday well you know maybe that's what's gonna happen um uh that would
[02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:59.720]  be a great move uh you know use the power of the free market to destroy these market players who
[02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:05.320]  have decided that they're just going to wield power like you know petty little apparatus chicks
[02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:09.000]  well you made great points i wrote those same notes he could forbid the government working
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:13.480]  with them declare them like wall way national security risk google and apple have moved to china
[02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:16.680]  that would devastate him right there i know he doesn't want to hurt the stock market in the
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:21.080]  process but you know it's it's it's kind of like if you don't do this surgery you're gonna die
[02:23:21.080 --> 02:23:24.840]  anyways and that's what trump said you know it's too bad but we just gotta act so that's what we've
[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:29.800]  gotten to and just why would they ban mitch mcconnell speaking out against people at his house
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:34.680]  saying we're gonna stab you to death but leave the people saying we're gonna murder you uh and
[02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:41.000]  calling him murder turtle leave them up but take him down are they asking for it i mean is twitter
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:47.800]  crazy no it's look the problem is these companies you know it isn't always top down i don't know
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:54.440]  that you know jack dorsi or marx zuckerberg really care one way or the other they might but you also
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:24:00.920]  have no i agree they've been there's mutiny they've been hijacked by sjw's yeah you've got this army
[02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:06.440]  of of little punks that work for these co corporations that are the ones making the ground
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:12.040]  level decisions and you know nobody's really getting them under control but you know another
[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:19.240]  thing that i really think that uh the the white house could do is go over to the department of
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:25.160]  justice grab whoever's working in the antitrust division and tell them do your job or find another
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:31.400]  job because the antitrust division should be going through silicon valley should be walking
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:38.280]  through the 650 area code with a death side cutting these companies apart there you know you're
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:44.040]  looking now you see that what's that bought by facebook is going to start looking at all those
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:49.400]  messages and deciding if they're going to ban you from what's that for private messages and logging
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:54.600]  private messages if you're using what's that for anything that you don't want you know some
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:59.720]  nose ring purple hair jackass looking at and deciding that they're going to publish well
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:04.680]  you're on the wrong platform and imagine the control freak power grab where they can't even
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:11.080]  control themselves when the head of the senate puts out a mild tweet saying we decry these calls
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:15.320]  for violence and hope the democrats will decry violence as well with a link to a woman saying
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:20.840]  they're going to stab him to death and then they they freeze his account and tell the head of the
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:28.840]  senate you now have to bow down these people are crazy these people are crazy they decide who they
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:34.920]  want to win and then they warp the language of their rules in order to let the person win who
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:39.000]  they want to win that's like you said though so another you have purple hair and nose ring we don't
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:45.160]  care except that's all these people or pink hair like you said member oliver darcy said a few months
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:49.320]  ago as well we want to get alex band on whatsapp we're checking to see if he's on that's a private
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:54.680]  message that that that facebook bought up the company i'm not on there we learned but they're
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:59.000]  literally trying to stop me from sending a message and i said folks and then as you said you sent
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  me the message last week it was in the news thanks for learning me to that they're now admitting
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:09.640]  they're going to be reading with ai but with also the personnel reading your text in live time
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:16.360]  deciding if you can send them or if they're going to ban you so literally like well they let us
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:21.720]  control their websites or their facebook's or twitter's now will or their instagram's now will
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:28.120]  just literally read what they're doing in live time the nsa it did that they'd be arrested
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  yeah they would but you know they they let them get away with it and antitrust is allowing these
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:41.880]  companies to consolidate at such a rate that you know you really have three or four companies
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:51.560]  controlling all new media and you can't have that so i i really hope that uh you know if if whoever's
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:56.680]  at the antitrust division doesn't want to do their job that trump you know tells them get
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.280]  out and don't let the door hit your ass in the way out and brings in somebody who knows what
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:04.520]  they're doing and who's willing to do the job amazing mark i know you gotta take care of your
[02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:08.600]  daughters that you've got right now but just just in closing come back soon as when you're able to
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:13.560]  go through these how many pages of documents from this huge epstein lawsuit victory you just had at
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:19.560]  the major court of appeals and and what can we be expecting when can we learn more well you know
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:25.800]  right now as far as i've seen the the best source for who's gone through it so far is zero hedge
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:30.440]  you know you you go to cnn and you search for epstein there hasn't been a story since
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:37.320]  you know since august 7th but you know somebody puts out a tweet claiming something and they'll
[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:43.480]  have they'll have that up is breaking news so uh your guess is as good as mine uh i think uh the
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:49.800]  the marketplace is open right now for us to go through these documents see what's been going
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:55.320]  on and there's going to be more by the way i mean all we argued for was for the summary judgment
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:28:01.240]  arguments uh summary judgment documents to be opened there are even more documents that can be

[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:41.880]  you know folks i'm tempted i'll probably do it come in here this weekend
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:48.280]  and just do like a three or four hour commercial free special show to air all of Trump's 35 minute
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:54.280]  press conference and analyze each piece of it but also the senate and house intelligence committees
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:34:00.200]  have had meetings about how china is not just controlling hollywood but financing all these
[02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:06.760]  race war movies when i get up here and i say the chinese government is running hollywood that's why
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:11.240]  you turn it on and you think america is the worst place in the world that's a foreign power doing
[02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:17.160]  that so hollywood has the power as americans to finance whatever movie they want and then
[02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:21.960]  want to put that type of crap out they can but a foreign government's funding it it's called
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:27.960]  treason ladies and gentlemen and again i was the first person 15 16 years ago gosh time flies
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:33.080]  to talk about this because i've been in some major movies never really tried i got invited to be in
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:39.480]  them and then they wanted me to be in a bunch of other movies and i was out there saying who
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:43.400]  really runs hollywood and they said oh you didn't know china's already bought up all the big companies
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:48.040]  well now it's just ridiculous so this is so big joe biggs is here he's been
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:53.240]  deplatformed even worse than i have we're gonna go to our next guest you're riding shotgun with us
[02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:57.720]  but this all ties together we're gonna be talking to jim baker here who ran illinois for trump and
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:02.360]  wants to warn about some of these bad leftist forces and then the coke brothers that always get
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:06.280]  accused being funded by the coke brothers gave more money than clinton's they ever gave to republicans
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:13.400]  i mean it's just all bunch of bulls but uh just recapping how folks can find you what you're doing
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:19.000]  in portland coming up i mean what it's like to witness all of this censorship that's happening
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:22.200]  really the only way you can find me now is just to google my name and you're gonna find articles
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:26.680]  everywhere i mean that's about the only way you can see what i'm doing and then guys like you let
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:31.960]  me come on your show um gavin mcginnis will have me on his um and other places you know but that's
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:37.880]  really about it i mean i have no other way uh to speak to people um and i've passed on information
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:41.560]  things i'm doing to other individuals to other journalists and let them know hey this is what
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:45.560]  i'm doing this what i'm working on um and everyone's kind of been a big help to kind of rally behind
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:50.360]  me for that and next weekend is our event it's the end domestic terrorism rally in portland
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:56.600]  organ august 17th and we're expecting uh around a thousand people to show up to this um you know
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:02.760]  what's most frustrating to me every day and i love the listeners but it's like chinese water torture
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:09.480]  over and over again the drop drop drop drop drop on your forehead i'll be at the store i'll be at
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:14.040]  the grocery store i'll go to with a friend of their church i'll be walking down the street they go
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:18.760]  oh take pictures oh we loved you we used to watch you all the time on youtube or we used to listen
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:24.600]  on itunes on a podcast and are you gonna get back on air and i'll always ask the question like what
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:30.600]  was the last show you heard well it was all about you know uh pedophile rings or whatever and i'm
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:36.840]  like listen info wars dot com news wars dot com you understand we built our own system with audio
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:41.640]  and video in our own studios we always had our own system and matt drudge advises four years ago to
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:46.440]  really get away from it we did so we've got something everybody else has nothing that's
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:51.560]  that's what's scary is they can say whatever they want about joe biggs no and he doesn't have a place
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:57.000]  anywhere to respond to it at least when they lie about me i have i have millions of my listeners
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:03.240]  i get to reach to but the only way i get out around the lie is that when you speak out when you
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:08.280]  take action i've been banned on paypal show is he oh the head of visa said we're not gonna ban
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:14.760]  gun purchases right now i'm like oh he's so nice everyone else is the nr a is now the new target
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:19.320]  this is the mark of the beast folks whether you believe in god or the devil of not the devil believes
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:27.880]  in you and this system is real and and bringing up jim baker jim baker called into the show i was uh
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:33.880]  aware of some of the work he'd done his political operative historian we should get on as a guest
[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:38.280]  about that who served in various roles in a number of campaigns during 2016 primaries and
[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:43.080]  caucuses he served as president trump's state director for kansas colorado delinoy and he was
[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:48.120]  there witnessing all the dirty tricks of ten crews who i still like but man he got dirty when the
[02:37:48.120 --> 02:37:54.280]  when the cards were down so yeah not going to turn my back on him uh but uh he and he witnessed the
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:59.080]  the coke brothers and and and and these globalist interests that are in there so he can give you a
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:02.680]  bird's eye view thanks for coming on with us sorry i moved you back 30 minutes i'm behind you
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:07.080]  there we appreciate your time that's all right thanks for having me alex um love your show love
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:12.280]  your work joe biggs we actually met uh i think in the colorado state capital at that stop the
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:17.640]  steel rally we did to um to kind of work against uh that hijacking of the process they did in the
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:24.280]  colorado caucus but um yeah so i started with trump in iowa i'm an iowa resident i've worked
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:30.360]  in iowa politics for a long time and uh you know we had a good team in iowa and had things going
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:34.360]  pretty well it actually looked like we were going to win and then all of a sudden about i don't know
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:41.400]  two three weeks out from the actual caucus date we got this flooding of afp operative so americans
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:47.720]  for prosperity which would be the coke brothers uh main apparatus and i just remember the minute
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:51.480]  they got there everything kind of changed and we all kind of sense that they were might be tanking
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:58.040]  the operation a little bit i don't know if you remember we had a debate scheduled and as soon
[02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:01.640]  as they got there to decided they weren't going to do this fox news debate which yeah we knew
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:05.800]  meg and kelly wasn't being fair but at the end of the day we knew that was really going to hurt
[02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:10.120]  our iowa operation and not to mention that but they just started cussing and drinking in the
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:15.480]  office and we had these midwestern sweet volunteers and uh it just turned everybody off anyway so we
[02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:21.320]  lost iowa and i came in third place and then like i said i went to kansas i wasn't given any staff i
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:28.120]  wasn't given any uh office i ran out of a hotel suite into pika you could just tell once the afp
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:32.520]  guys got in there that uh they were leaving us alone when it looked like trump didn't have a chance
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:38.840]  but then once we actually got some momentum traction yeah you could tell that they kind of
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:43.000]  jumped in and the reason you're important is you ended up heading up three major states
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.000]  and i remember seeing you on the news i know who you are i mean you're a real player in this and
[02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:50.760]  you're you're giving us the inside window to what happened you can give us a really good
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:58.040]  forecast on what's going to come yeah so i i basically retired after 2016 went into the private
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:04.200]  sector just the hate and the vitriol and and what some of the afp people tried to do to me after
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:08.520]  i left the trump campaign i actually went and ran an independent campaign up in upstate new
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:13.880]  york um i just got more into you know studying the bible and being with my family and just kind
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:18.680]  of cleansed my soul of politics but now seeing what's going on now with gun control and with this
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:23.000]  transgender stuff and the attacks on our kids i just can't sit idly by the lords told me i needed
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:27.800]  to talk to you that's why i called in uh the other day but i mean if you look at the coke brothers
[02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:33.240]  a lot of people consider them to be our version the conservative version is right they're not
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:39.800]  no they're not and if you look if you go to afp's website i think it's still up they have
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:45.880]  a petition for the senate judiciary committee that says don't enact any antitrust laws against
[02:40:45.880 --> 02:40:51.240]  big tech i mean their top guy jessie blumenthal i think his name is who runs their tech and
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:56.920]  innovation wing uh at afp as said there's no credible evidence of conservative censorship
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:03.080]  online do you see that alex and so you know exactly so what you're saying is the coke brothers
[02:41:03.080 --> 02:41:08.840]  and this afp are the enemy how how do we stop them so what i want to say to president trump if i
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:13.880]  could talk to him directly i would say you're still hiring from the swamp so the way these afp
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:19.080]  guys work in almost every republican operative works on a campaign for a little while and then
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:23.160]  the campaign's over they win they lose whatever but in the off season they go to work for afp
[02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:28.280]  and as the bible says in the book of james a double minded person is unstable in all his ways
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:32.760]  so these people have dual allegiances or sometimes just an allegiance to the coke brothers
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:36.680]  and they're still working for trump there's something like 44 coke awkward operatives in
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:41.480]  the trump white house or in the trump administration so for this reelection campaign i tell trump if
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:46.200]  you want to hire somebody hire people out of business you're a businessman hire salespeople
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:50.520]  you don't need exactly and again the coach didn't give any money to trump and he doesn't know all
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:55.800]  this he needs to throw their asses out they're already said two months ago they said in bright
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:41:59.720]  it's in bright bright part i think it was on info wars a bunch of different places they're
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:05.240]  supporting democrats in 2020 okay uh they're open well that's right it was in there was a new york
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:10.840]  times article like the coke brothers are really good and they're supporting democrats now they if
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:16.680]  your listeners want to look up this quincey institute for responsible statecraft uh david
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:22.440]  coke i think put in 500 million george soros put in 500 million and they named an iranian american
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:28.040]  who's very anti-israel loves elon omar to to run this quincey institute for responsible statecraft
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:31.800]  stop right there see how bombshell this is and the numbers are all there i've seen this
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:35.400]  the coke brothers were always democrats they were the second biggest donor to clinton's
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:40.840]  at reticent chicken and then they come in to control republicans and the left always says
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:46.520]  i work for the coke brothers absolute asinine lies and now they're teamed up the coke brothers
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:52.120]  with george soros to defeat donald trump and trump doesn't even know he's got people in the oval
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:43:00.360]  office sharpening knives for him thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:05.240]  was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:09.240]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the communist
[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:15.560]  chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls

[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:07.480]  the store because i mean i don't want to get that money to walmart i don't want to give that money
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:11.240]  to people who are going to donate it to causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:15.560]  you and i'm getting quality products the products that i do receive have changed my life i mean the
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:20.520]  x2 has really done a lot for me i've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kids
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:25.400]  they use the toothpaste my son used to get these little sore throat so he puts x2 in water and
[02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:29.560]  drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat well sir let me break this down for you i want high
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:34.280]  quality stuff in there i want a good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:38.760]  buys when it's 50 off i'm making two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:43.080]  like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:47.560]  when people get the patriot points a lot of times it makes things a loss later because if you're
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:52.200]  already getting 10% off because you're on autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:55.800]  like that uh we have patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:01.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:17.080]  human animal clones are openly being produced it's now all admitted
[02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:21.640]  everything you do about all these home assistants is being listened to and watched
[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:25.160]  that was an associated press yesterday world government is here
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:32.440]  and yes the boy scouts of america now basically are run by pedophiles that's mainstream news
[02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:39.480]  i told you that 20 years ago this takeover is massive it's world government it's here but we
[02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:47.720]  can say no to it and we can fight back jim baker is a political operative historian and he headed
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:53.000]  up the trump campaign as the state director for kansas colorado in illinois that's huge
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:58.840]  those are always massive kansas massive colorado to tell you how important those are so he was
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:05.000]  there witnessing this and just during the break we were talking about it looking it up yeah it's
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:12.840]  crazy how the coke brothers um it was also their plants got raided uh it was in mississippi
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:17.880]  louisiana i'm going for memory yeah there it is mississippi those were their plants that all the
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:23.720]  illegals working at them and so they teach the illegals how to get on welfare so the coke brothers
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:28.200]  can pay them only a little bit of money and that's taxpayer incentive but the coke brothers then
[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:32.680]  tell us how they're libertarians and how you know we should have government involvement but really
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:38.520]  most their wealth is subsidized by poor people and illegals and by the fact that they train them
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:42.360]  even walmart does this hands out paperwork saying we only pay it this much so you can also
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:49.000]  go get welfare so that's pretty sick isn't it jim yeah and and that's the the libra initiative
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:53.640]  which is another arm kind of like afp where a lot of these republican operative work operatives work
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:49:00.360]  kind of in the off season that's a that's another arm that's for amnesty against borders so so president
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:04.760]  trump has all these people close to his inner circle some i would say probably are almost in his
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:10.120]  inner circle that actively want him to fail i mean they don't they don't want anything on his agenda
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:16.200]  they want a bush type republican a john mccain type republican that's going to be free borders globalist
[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:21.400]  north american union uh all the stuff that that trump doesn't want they're actively working in the
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:25.400]  background to bring in and they're going to get rewarded by the coke brothers if trumps out of
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:31.320]  office if they tank his campaign i guarantee you they're going to get rewarded with jobs money you
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:37.560]  know whatever you can imagine they'll have and i mean at the end of the day it's not only open
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:44.440]  borders it's a tech censorship i mean last month they had the after charlottesville conference
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:50.120]  which was sponsored by the coke brothers by the adl and by george soros um there was another one
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:55.640]  called something by the tech leadership summit and they're openly partnering with soros now so
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:59.480]  they're not hiding the fact that they're fake conservatives anymore they were fake conservatives
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:04.920]  they're liberal globalist open borders uh you know wolves in sheep's clothing and we have these
[02:50:04.920 --> 02:50:11.400]  operatives in the campaign right now so some of them are just uh useful idiots for the for the
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:17.160]  mercenaries uh social climbers right but they're still programmed by handlers they gave me an afp
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:21.000]  handler when i was in the campaign that's why i got fired from the campaign because i wouldn't
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:26.280]  talk to him i talked to paul maniforte and roger stone instead uh i mean that's exactly why i left
[02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:32.200]  so at the end of the day trump well they can say what they want about roger stone he was all the way
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:37.640]  for trump and he was secretly advising everybody and he said no they've got they've got leftist
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:41.800]  and coke brother operatives in there he was constant on the phone saying don't listen to that do this
[02:50:41.800 --> 02:50:45.720]  i mean trump wouldn't want if it wasn't for stona manifold and notice that one's in jail
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:50.520]  they're trying to put the other in jail yeah yeah and uh you know that's part of the reason of course
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:54.600]  why i've been hesitant to speak out but like i said i mean the lord put it on my heart that i can't
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:59.240]  stay silent anymore describe what that was like because i'm the same way i mean i don't try to
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:03.320]  get like bible thumpery or whatever because that's fake christians are coming oh the lord now good
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:08.680]  they are i'm a wicked devil but god is in control of me and i can you get laid upon me like i've
[02:51:08.680 --> 02:51:14.440]  got to do this and it's like i'm on fire and i can only follow those orders i'm not a slave i
[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:19.000]  ask god for that but man it's something else though and that fire comes down now it's just like
[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:24.600]  it's so much power quite frankly i can't control it yeah and i mean as a historian i mean you can
[02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:28.120]  even look back and and i looked at the coke brothers and i saw every time you get these
[02:51:28.120 --> 02:51:33.960]  globalists there's always nazi ties okay uh the patriarch of the coke family you can look it up
[02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:41.080]  it's mainstream news uh he built the largest oil refinery in humberg in 1935 uh before that he was
[02:51:41.080 --> 02:51:45.800]  working for oh yeah the coast made their money building the nazi war machine yeah and and the
[02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:49.640]  the soviet war machine too because the five years before that i'm the child's five-year plan
[02:51:49.640 --> 02:51:53.160]  they were working for him too and listen we'll have you back for a full hour you're a great guy but
[02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:58.520]  get back to you to god what is what it's like when you just wanted to go write books and be a christian
[02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:02.040]  and be with your family you don't want to get in the swamp but then what was it like when god
[02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:05.720]  like told you you're gonna you're gonna get back in the fight and then you called in you got on
[02:52:05.720 --> 02:52:09.800]  you didn't ask to be a guest i said get him as a guest that's how the holy spirit works the enemy
[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:14.360]  has their own evil network we have our own you know it was a triggering event i mean i'm sitting on
[02:52:14.360 --> 02:52:18.920]  the couch watching a cartoon with my dog one of my daughters and uh i can't remember what it was
[02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:25.880]  called but it was just the most filthy uh anti christian almost pornographic cartoon on netflix
[02:52:25.880 --> 02:52:31.000]  i think it was some kind of japanese cartoon um and then i started paying attention to how they're
[02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:36.120]  trying to get get to the kids get to the children and you know i got on my knees and i prayed and i
[02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:42.680]  just realized that the lord was telling me i know it's been nice to to you know study the bible more
[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:47.960]  and quit reading the news and and you know spend more time with your family but it's time to fight
[02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:52.520]  you have to pay attention to what's going on as christ said it's going to be just like it was in
[02:52:52.520 --> 02:52:56.680]  the days of noah towards the end of the end of times and that would be worse right it's gonna be
[02:52:56.680 --> 02:53:00.840]  worse the days of no and if you look at anti deluvian history as well i mean it's all getting
[02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:06.680]  repeated child sacrifice abortion uh well that's the ultimate it is killing that seed of potential
[02:53:06.680 --> 02:53:12.280]  that god's given us innocence they're obsessed with the innocence so just like in legend you know
[02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:16.920]  great movie but it's like the devil wants to hurt the unicorn so he can then kill the virgin girl
[02:53:16.920 --> 02:53:22.440]  that's that's a child yeah he wants to kill the potential of the universe sorry keep going
[02:53:23.240 --> 02:53:28.360]  no so i mean like i said the anti deluvian world was child sacrifice it was uh confusing gender
[02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:33.640]  roles it was uh all kinds of things and as paul says in the book of romans chapter one uh god gave
[02:53:33.640 --> 02:53:39.240]  them over to a reprobate mind because they because he'd given up on society and i feel like we got
[02:53:39.240 --> 02:53:44.040]  this reprieve or the world got a reprieve with the election of donald trump and i don't want to see
[02:53:44.040 --> 02:53:49.880]  it wasted i don't agree but i have that same worldly thing where i just want to run off with my kids
[02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:54.360]  and my family there's some rural area pretend this isn't happening but at a gut level i know
[02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:59.000]  10 years from now they're coming for me there we've got to stand we got to fight and i exactly and
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:03.800]  it's not like we're even scared of the enemy it's getting i call it goblin guts you know we've got
[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:08.040]  to go in and fight them and just looking at them and dealing with them and it's like having to
[02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:12.600]  focus on them it's almost like a form of worship so it's very important we're studying globalists
[02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:16.760]  to not hate them and get too into it because i do it myself where i get obsessed with how
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:20.120]  bad they are and it's almost like they they can you just got to think about the children
[02:54:20.120 --> 02:54:24.200]  we're here to protect children we're here to fight this evil we're here to get humans over the finish
[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:29.640]  line to the next level that's god's plan but it is it is hard it is because it's the it's the it's
[02:54:29.640 --> 02:54:36.760]  the focusing on them it's very painful yeah this i mean this is what i keep telling people i mean
[02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:42.760]  we're at this time right now in this country where people need to start standing up they need to
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:47.560]  start fighting back in a sense we need to be more vocal it's okay to be angry and pissed off with
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:52.360]  the way the direction of the country is going at times and with what's happening and it's okay
[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:57.320]  voicing that because that's going to motivate other people and when we get enough people
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:00.760]  pissed off and sick and tired of what's going on we can start making some good changes
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:04.440]  right now there's too many people that are too complacent and too spineless and they just sit
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:09.640]  back and go well you know maybe it'll just happen well things don't just happen it takes men standing
[02:55:09.640 --> 02:55:13.720]  up and fighting for something they believe in that's how you get stuff done well and it's also
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:17.560]  the time we're in now's the time of action and trump's a leader and he's not perfect but he's
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:21.320]  who god literally has put this position there's no doubt the enemy knows that they're so scared
[02:55:21.320 --> 02:55:24.600]  there's not just evil in the world but i had so much great family most of them are dead now
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:29.400]  who are really strong christian tough men but they saw this and just went ahead in the country
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:33.640]  and i'm not putting them down for that but we there's so many great men listening right now
[02:55:33.640 --> 02:55:39.000]  and great women who just say i can't handle it i just gotta i've gotta i've gotta hide my kids
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:44.200]  they're going to get your children okay there's no backing out of this now there's no hiding
[02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:47.880]  i know the bible says run to the hills that's in that perspective when some enemy invades
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:52.760]  running to the hills now is is running to face the enemy you want to comment on that jim beggar
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:57.560]  yeah i mean christ says that we're a remnant so we're not split we're not going to be the
[02:55:57.560 --> 02:56:02.040]  majority more especially in the end times but we have to protect the children though the lord
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:05.400]  says we have to protect those who can't protect themselves and of course that's who the satanists
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:09.320]  and the globalists are going after they're going after the children they're going after the menly
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:13.400]  handicap i mean that that's the main people that they're trying to chemically and god says if you
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:17.480]  don't defend the children i don't know you it'd be better for you to tie a boulder to your neck
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:22.680]  and jump in the ocean yeah like juda suscaria i mean he hung himself and then he fell down
[02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:28.600]  onto the rocks and he was gutted i mean god doesn't respect anyone that does not first of all respect
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:33.800]  him and respect the children that can't can't protect themselves i just feel such a conviction
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:37.320]  and i think that's what you were saying as well that that we have to fight against this we have
[02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:41.480]  to use any gift that god's given us i know personally i can see that you have the gift of
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:45.000]  discernment i think i have that gift as well where i if i can talk to somebody i can tell if
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:48.760]  they're for real or not and that's like when i was in the trump campaign i talked to some of
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:54.120]  those people and i just saw snake eyes i said you're a devil you don't believe in this uh no other
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:58.440]  people were great they were true believers i appreciated their hard work but these professionals
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:02.840]  they brought in devils they didn't want trump to win they wanted the same old status that's because
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:07.480]  they come from a system where they had to compromise to even get in the door and once you compromise
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:11.560]  compromise compromise compromise compromise compromise you get rewarded for it but you're
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:18.200]  losing who you are the whole time i mean how do you get him out it's easy it's easy for trump it
[02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:21.720]  wouldn't be easy for someone who doesn't have his background but he's a businessman hey tom

[03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:43.640]  portland's my city austin's my city all these cities are my city it's america i should be able
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:48.920]  to go anywhere i want and have a rally and i should be people should praise the fact that
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:54.200]  people are standing up in mass numbers against a group of mass you know terrorists running around
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:00:59.320]  and bugs assaulting and beating people up doxing them getting their lives ruined i mean it's not
[03:00:59.320 --> 03:01:03.880]  just your right it's your duty yes you have to i mean that's what people need to be doing
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:08.920]  you should wake up with that fire in your gut like many of us have and be out here and you don't
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:12.760]  have to go to all these events i understand people have kids you've got jobs you can't always commit
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:17.080]  to go do things like this but there's other ways to help there's other ways to do things as well
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:20.440]  um and that's just sharing stuff like this and content and getting it out there and helping
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:26.680]  spread uh what it is we're all doing um gut level make your point but next what do you think gut
[03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:30.920]  level is going to happen i think they don't want you to come because they don't want to look like
[03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:37.160]  wimps and and then have to back down what i think they're trying to do right now is intimidate us
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:41.480]  to not come yeah they're trying their best you know and a lot of people are worried i mean we're
[03:01:41.480 --> 03:01:45.240]  seeing a lot of stuff on twitter being posted getting screenshots daily throughout the day
[03:01:45.240 --> 03:01:51.480]  of different very viable uh threats and i'm sending that stuff to the fbi into the the pd there i've
[03:01:51.480 --> 03:01:56.360]  had long conversations with them the fbi sent me a text i forgot to tell you earlier um they will be
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:02:00.120]  meeting me at the airport as soon as i land in portland they have an area that they're going to
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:05.400]  close off where they will sit down with enrique and i with the portland pd and question us about
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:09.560]  this event and it's really concerning to me that they're so concerned with enrique and i
[03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:15.560]  you know any event i've ever held there has been zero violence we've had nothing like that even
[03:02:15.560 --> 03:02:20.760]  aren't my last event with enrique was in dc we let william uh lamont jenkins he's one of the
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:26.120]  fbi question to you after you went down into the opasso remember they're just really scared of you
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:30.280]  joe yeah you know we had darrell lamont jenkins he's one of the primary you killed a few guys in
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:34.200]  combat you got a lot of awards you were staff sergeant but they particularly your file they
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:38.600]  really are scared of you for some reason i don't know why i'm a very nice guy i like to ride my
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:43.000]  motorcycle and go surfing and i enjoy a frosty beer every now and then you know why do you
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:47.960]  think it is though because you know because these people are so used to people backing down to be
[03:02:47.960 --> 03:02:54.360]  in bully and i've got that fight not urge you know like that's why our flag is the way it is on our
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:59.000]  uniform because it shows us running into battle it takes certain people to run into where the guns
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:02.840]  you know you know shots are being fired instead of running away from it you know and there's people
[03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:07.000]  like us out there they exist and when we see something bad happening we see wrong being done
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:12.040]  and we see innocent people being hurt we want to go help them we want to we wake up with that fire
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:15.880]  to go hey i don't want this to happen to you when any knows attack i tweeted out said man
[03:03:15.880 --> 03:03:19.320]  i want to pull security for us like i'm never going to let someone attack you again i said
[03:03:19.320 --> 03:03:23.000]  if that's the last thing i can ever do you know and then that's when it started getting attention
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:26.680]  that's when we decided to put on the rally and do all this i don't want to see people get hurt
[03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:31.320]  that's it why am i a bad guy for that that i don't want to know the truth is they don't want you
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:37.000]  to trigger other americans stand up for free speech mitch McConnell said it's wrong to come
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:41.800]  threatened to kill me at my house twitter banding they froze his account because standing up to them
[03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:47.400]  is evil it honestly being banned on the pottles of terrorist being banned on social media is one
[03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:52.200]  of the greatest things that's ever happened to me it's freed up so much time i have less stress
[03:03:52.200 --> 03:03:56.200]  i'm happier you know they but they think they won they think that they got it they're like they're
[03:03:56.200 --> 03:04:00.280]  bragging i had people um when you're first banned from twitter it's like you're a ghost you can see
[03:04:00.280 --> 03:04:04.200]  everything in the timeline for a while yeah for a few weeks they let you see it yeah and you can see
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:07.960]  everyone talking crap about your whatever they're saying gloating like oh i'm the guy that did this
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:11.400]  you know i bet he's at home crying right now i'm like no actually i don't even care i was like i got
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:14.760]  on my heart and went and wrote up and down the beach then i saw that there was waves i went back
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:19.560]  got my truck went surfing i'm having a blast i mean i'd love it but i still am paying attention
[03:04:19.560 --> 03:04:22.920]  to what's going on and i still had that fire in that draw exactly you don't want to be in the fight
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:27.640]  all the time they make you do it they think like taking you out of it it's totally different yeah
[03:04:27.640 --> 03:04:32.520]  they're not going to take me out i mean they want to try and that's one of the threats we're getting
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:37.160]  i think something's going to happen but it's not going to be from arian i'll tell you that we're
[03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:40.760]  going to do one more segment with you than dr nick baggis takes over i want to play a bunch of clips
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:47.640]  like trump saying that joe biden is out of his mind that's all coming up straight ahead info wars.com
[03:04:47.640 --> 03:04:51.080]  news wars.com the only way those sites get out is you
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:58.680]  Robert Barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies and
[03:04:58.680 --> 03:05:02.760]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:06.920]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts
[03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:11.080]  the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[03:05:11.080 --> 03:05:14.920]  members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social political
[03:05:14.920 --> 03:05:18.920]  economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will
[03:05:18.920 --> 03:05:22.920]  become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran
[03:05:22.920 --> 03:05:26.920]  american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[03:05:26.920 --> 03:05:31.720]  recover after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[03:05:31.720 --> 03:05:36.920]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the
[03:05:36.920 --> 03:05:41.800]  original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating
[03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:45.800]  and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and
[03:05:45.800 --> 03:05:49.800]  then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gas
[03:05:49.800 --> 03:06:05.720]  lighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[03:06:06.360 --> 03:06:14.920]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones and joe biggs former info wars reporter
[03:06:14.920 --> 03:06:20.280]  good friend of mine here with us he said a month and a half ago i'm gonna go out and a free speech
[03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:25.160]  rally important like joe gibson does and you got the platform everywhere now the fbi is calling
[03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:31.000]  visiting him visiting his family it's crazy you were just telling me during the break
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:35.720]  they're gonna meet you at the airport but tell the rest of the story you were you said does
[03:06:35.720 --> 03:06:39.080]  he want to talk to you they go no they won't talk to us yeah well you know i've been very
[03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:43.000]  forthcoming even after when the two attacks happened the two shootings he'll pass on the date
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:47.480]  when i even looked at my guys my my leadership guys and i said hey i think this is a great time
[03:06:47.480 --> 03:06:51.720]  for us to go ahead and like try to tone down everything let's reach out to the police there
[03:06:51.720 --> 03:06:55.480]  we've seen that they kind of they're making some statements there they seem really nervous the
[03:06:55.480 --> 03:06:59.880]  mayor i said maybe you know let's reach out to these guys and have a dialogue so we reached out
[03:07:00.680 --> 03:07:07.000]  and spoke with them well i speak with a pd and then the next day the fbi starts looking for me
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:11.640]  and you know they're like well the pd said they talked to you but now they think we should talk to
[03:07:11.640 --> 03:07:16.840]  you and i'm like well anything from the conversation didn't even escalate i would think or even reason
[03:07:16.840 --> 03:07:20.920]  to need to call the fbi they said what are you gonna do i said we're just gonna sit out there
[03:07:20.920 --> 03:07:24.360]  and have our rally and be very cool common collective and peaceful i said you guys do
[03:07:24.360 --> 03:07:29.320]  your job separate them from us i said we won't go antagonize them well let them antagonize us
[03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:33.560]  i said we'll only do anything in self-defense i said no one's bringing weapons we've made that
[03:07:33.560 --> 03:07:37.880]  time and time again clearly it's been on our event page and it's been there and i said you

[03:08:55.560 --> 03:09:01.240]  do you imagine if i don't stop was coming to your event can you what what would happen
[03:09:01.240 --> 03:09:06.120]  if i don't stop was coming that would like see i just i don't even want to stir this stuff up but
[03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:12.600]  i agree you've got to go do with these things i'm not saying you're wrong but i just maybe i should
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:17.160]  come to portland just because they're trying to tell you well they shouldn't be there it's gonna
[03:09:17.160 --> 03:09:23.560]  be a heated heated heated event well can you imagine if i'm there i know see and here's the
[03:09:23.560 --> 03:09:26.600]  funny thing their counter protests oh here's nothing i forgot to tell you too but their
[03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:30.680]  counter protests are supposed to all dress up in these funny things these funny costumes to make
[03:09:30.680 --> 03:09:34.360]  fun of the fascists and that's gonna weird us out that's their counter protest well no because
[03:09:34.360 --> 03:09:37.720]  they're always in black attack you're not supposed to be a counter now they're putting out flyers
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:44.200]  openly all over the antifa pages saying august 17th get your don your mage gear dress like them
[03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:50.120]  and carry out attacks see no that's what i picked up because i know i said this i said saturday i was
[03:09:50.120 --> 03:09:53.960]  wrong i said about the other guy it was sunday morning that that i was like look at this guy's
[03:09:53.960 --> 03:09:57.960]  picture he looks like a devil works for antifa well turns out the ohio shooter was they're getting
[03:09:57.960 --> 03:10:02.600]  smart man they're they want to hurt us remember the reports they were meet they're meeting overseas
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:05.720]  with like isis and stuff like that well the thing is you're saying though is that they're
[03:10:05.720 --> 03:10:11.080]  going to dress up like us and do stuff yeah that's it's a tactic that people like that use overseas
[03:10:12.760 --> 03:10:17.720]  explain that well think about this so like when i was in afghanistan we would have people dress up
[03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:22.760]  like afghan national police or the afghan army and they would walk up to a compound and then
[03:10:22.760 --> 03:10:27.480]  blow themselves up with a suicide vest you know they and you said you go oh hey you know because
[03:10:27.480 --> 03:10:31.800]  you'd see the uniform and like oh that's a friendly hey come on over here to our group boom
[03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:37.800]  and you're getting launched to the air you know that's one of the frightening things to me so we
[03:10:37.800 --> 03:10:41.560]  saw that poster i said at the fbi i said at the local pd and they're like oh cool things
[03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:47.240]  things i'm like were you going to take this seriously like well it's just like all these
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:50.840]  mass shooters the guy in ohio said i'm going to kill everybody the fbi guy he goes he goes if
[03:10:50.840 --> 03:10:55.240]  something happens you know this is going to be on you well okay so if a leftist antifa guy dresses
[03:10:55.240 --> 03:11:00.040]  up in maggots stuff and starts acting like an asshole and you know doing Nazi salutes and then
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:06.200]  starts sucker punching people that's on me well so that's what i said is small it wasn't smart
[03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:10.040]  he didn't hire real people to at least attack him and actually break his own nose he wasn't
[03:11:10.040 --> 03:11:13.960]  committed i said they're going to start because when i wasn't losing fried chicken they came over
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:18.280]  the table said i'm gonna kill you you're gonna die then they were waiting when i tried to walk out
[03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:23.640]  they positioned themselves so i blew up at them the way they edited the video to say that i attacked
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:29.720]  them the way the left all worked together they're all false flaggers now yeah and so even the low
[03:11:29.720 --> 03:11:33.800]  level they're saying hey go out commit crimes like this guy that came into walmart he said well
[03:11:33.800 --> 03:11:37.800]  i'm a liberal i would take the guns but i'm gonna kill 200 people so we finally take them
[03:11:37.800 --> 03:11:41.560]  they've now converted down to the low level that they're going to do false flags
[03:11:41.560 --> 03:11:46.760]  without even orders that's why i mean this is a damn evil group of people folks i mean i don't
[03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:51.800]  know how you deal with something they're just so deceptive that's why we have a ton of camera
[03:11:51.800 --> 03:11:55.720]  crews coming to sit there and keep an eye because there's but again they'll try to
[03:11:55.720 --> 03:12:00.120]  delete all those so the truth doesn't get out i just need for court if it comes down to that
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:07.000]  point i mean i agree with the el paso guy the el paso killer reportedly no he was a big democrat
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:12.440]  that's confirmed they why they covered up his record i mean it's just that's the new level
[03:12:12.440 --> 03:12:16.680]  folks the left is going to stage events they've already announced it they caught a guy on walmart
[03:12:16.680 --> 03:12:20.600]  they're they're saying they may indict oh yeah i saw that yeah well it's what another guy showed
[03:12:20.600 --> 03:12:26.120]  up at walmart too in battle gear to create hysteria yeah so the left are all failed
[03:12:27.640 --> 03:12:32.680]  basically actors most of them have degrees no i'm not saying you're bad rob do has a degree
[03:12:32.680 --> 03:12:37.960]  uh in uh stage theater and costumes he's a great editor a smart guy you know he runs
[03:12:37.960 --> 03:12:42.520]  half this operation but he'll tell you most of the people are frothing and so they're actors
[03:12:43.080 --> 03:12:47.000]  so their power they think is expressing that because they couldn't get on netflix
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:51.720]  in the real world well my buddy's told me about the the attack in el paso my immediate thought was
[03:12:51.720 --> 03:12:54.920]  there's a lot of attention on the past uh pass here right now you got brine colfudge out there
[03:12:54.920 --> 03:12:58.680]  you got steven bay at steve bannon and they're doing that whole portion of the wall right across
[03:12:58.680 --> 03:13:02.840]  and sundown park rise to live um and that's the area i used to cross all the time and do videos
[03:13:02.840 --> 03:13:08.440]  which the airfield's named after grandpa uh yeah so the they're putting the wall right there and i
[03:13:08.440 --> 03:13:13.240]  know steve bannon's out there brine colfudge uh all these other like prominent right wing people
[03:13:13.240 --> 03:13:17.160]  right now that are helping with this whole border stuff they've been out to having all these events
[03:13:17.160 --> 03:13:22.040]  i personally thought maybe they got win that bannon or colfage was in a walmart and that guy went in
[03:13:22.040 --> 03:13:25.800]  to take him out because they don't want to do that they want to send a message because a week prior
[03:13:25.800 --> 03:13:30.920]  antifa came out and saying that they're going to siege el paso and go after these people at the
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:37.000]  border that was my initial thought well they were saying we're coming down there to kill everybody
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:40.600]  well why would this kid drive from dallas to go there like why that like you just the whole thing
[03:13:40.600 --> 03:13:46.520]  smells i said i'd play some clips though here is trump talking about um joe biden doesn't know
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:51.480]  what planet he's on which is true which again is emblematic of the fact that the the the
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:55.720]  establishments in power because we haven't gotten the country back yet we're still the resistance but
[03:13:55.720 --> 03:13:59.160]  we've got partial power back they are just crazy here it is
[03:14:01.320 --> 03:14:08.840]  yeah his comments look look joe is not playing with a full deck he made that comment i said whoa i saw
[03:14:08.840 --> 03:14:15.480]  it because i was on something i had a television i saw his comments joe biden is not playing with
[03:14:15.480 --> 03:14:21.640]  a full deck this is not somebody you could have as your president but if he got the nomination i'd
[03:14:21.640 --> 03:14:28.760]  be thrilled i mean joe biden can hardly talk at this point it's funny how they're going after obama
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:32.520]  but using biden as a bad guy you know have you seen all these debates like they're attacking
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:36.920]  everything obama did and they're making biden the boogie guy he's like well you knew all these bad
[03:14:36.920 --> 03:14:41.800]  things were happening you know they had kids in cages why didn't you do something so they're
[03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:45.640]  they're really going after a while they eat their own they have no there's no honor among thieves
[03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:51.560]  oh no and that's the thing is they just are wide out because i'm gonna say again the senate and
[03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:56.200]  house intelligence committee's finally had hearings last week i learned about it monday
[03:14:56.200 --> 03:15:01.320]  where they they go this many billions of that billion to fund culture and notice trump's now
[03:15:01.320 --> 03:15:06.680]  saying it the chinese government's funding this race war stuff man because they look at our weakness
[03:15:06.680 --> 03:15:11.960]  they go what's our strength our diversity well we'll make that the issue and then hollywood will take
[03:15:11.960 --> 03:15:17.640]  money i told you out they wanted me to go to sundance so i sent a crew member and they thought
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:21.480]  it was like an invite for us to be to sell out and i said listen i can't deal with these people
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:25.320]  you go and it was the power structure trying to offer me a movie deal to sell out i can't say who
[03:15:25.320 --> 03:15:30.680]  but it was big so i sent our guy in like they think we're so dumb and they're in these meetings going
[03:15:30.680 --> 03:15:37.560]  our job is to wreck society and be as venomous as possible and create a collapse and we're like oh

[03:17:55.080 --> 03:17:59.160]  york marcus here on the air thanks for holding hey i'll yeah i just want to say uh your show is a
[03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:03.240]  breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could
[03:18:03.240 --> 03:18:08.440]  tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately
[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:13.160]  to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him
[03:18:13.160 --> 03:18:17.880]  in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be
[03:18:17.880 --> 03:18:21.400]  the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating
[03:18:21.400 --> 03:18:25.000]  him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:29.960]  alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love
[03:18:29.960 --> 03:18:33.800]  to see you on air until you're 80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're
[03:18:33.800 --> 03:18:39.720]  80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and

[03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:10.120]  hearing the ads so you think you don't want to hear an ad i don't want to hear an ad but here's the

[03:19:53.800 --> 03:20:00.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:00.120 --> 03:20:10.440]  so
[03:20:15.240 --> 03:20:20.440]  now here through the lives and disinformation it's alex jones
[03:20:24.200 --> 03:20:29.640]  all right one of my favorite guest dr. dick bagg it's a great patriot who you know lost his dad
[03:20:29.640 --> 03:20:35.640]  he ever talks about it for the fight for land rights uh in alaska and his brother's been a u.s
[03:20:35.640 --> 03:20:41.880]  senator but i'd say the whole family he's the most important because he absolutely forecast
[03:20:41.880 --> 03:20:47.560]  everything we're seeing happen now in books he wrote 20 25 years ago so he's taken over and i
[03:20:47.560 --> 03:20:51.160]  and i appreciate him being here and i'm sorry we're getting them on late just briefly or he won't be
[03:20:51.160 --> 03:20:57.800]  here uh when you finance what we're doing you're not just funding the second american revolution
[03:20:57.800 --> 03:21:02.840]  you're changing world destiny and there's so much fake stuff out there in a million different voices
[03:21:02.840 --> 03:21:08.760]  and and i understand that but but we really are in the zeitgeist and we try to make it easy to get
[03:21:08.760 --> 03:21:15.160]  good products at the same time but i can just tell you point blank you cannot invest in a place better
[03:21:16.520 --> 03:21:21.320]  than info wars for human liberty in a pro human future and i'm not a complainer in fact i don't
[03:21:21.320 --> 03:21:25.960]  even think about all the things they've done to me uh i can't even sit down with a piece of paper
[03:21:25.960 --> 03:21:31.160]  sit down with a piece of paper and write down all the things they've done to us because i only want
[03:21:31.160 --> 03:21:36.200]  to give it attention i want to think about the future but i've made all the cuts i've done all
[03:21:36.200 --> 03:21:43.080]  the tricks i pulled out all the stops and uh we're not funded by any sugar daddies we're funded by you
[03:21:43.080 --> 03:21:48.120]  so we've been sold out for three four months of the best krill oil out there and people looked
[03:21:48.120 --> 03:21:52.760]  this up and found out how good it was all natural krill oil that's had any mercury that's in it taken
[03:21:52.760 --> 03:21:58.120]  out these are now back in stock 50% off out of the gates grab to end this big special 50 to 60%
[03:21:58.120 --> 03:22:03.320]  off the store right free shipping and double patriot points but um i don't want to spend my time
[03:22:03.320 --> 03:22:08.600]  trying to get money in here but anybody that knows that the world works knows that honest made money
[03:22:08.600 --> 03:22:14.760]  is a lot harder to get than this you know globalist money and you know quite frankly uh things that
[03:22:14.760 --> 03:22:17.880]  are offered off record all they were talking about because that's a journalistic thing but
[03:22:17.880 --> 03:22:22.840]  i've been offered big money uh probably seven eight times over the years and the offers have gotten
[03:22:22.840 --> 03:22:28.040]  quite large it's like we're gonna kill you or you take this and so you know it's it's gotten to
[03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:32.520]  that point again they're like really we're gonna kill you so just you know uh it's fine you know
[03:22:32.520 --> 03:22:39.080]  what because i i can't sign on to this thing that wants to sexualize kids and everybody gets fried
[03:22:39.080 --> 03:22:43.240]  by 5g and we all die cancer i mean it's really easy not to sell out to you but i just want the
[03:22:43.240 --> 03:22:50.920]  listeners to know i don't want to just not say yes to these guys and bow down and and and just
[03:22:50.920 --> 03:22:56.520]  stand up to them and get killed i want to win so as much as i'm willing to die to fight these people
[03:22:56.520 --> 03:23:00.040]  and that's not talk at this point everybody knows we're not trying to play it child porn on us folks
[03:23:00.040 --> 03:23:03.880]  i can't tell you what's happening on scenes it confirms how evil they are okay the guy that's
[03:23:03.880 --> 03:23:08.280]  taking over his daddy got killed an airplane just because he wanted people to have their own land
[03:23:08.280 --> 03:23:13.240]  in alaska and everything we've got because people are willing to die here's the thing i'm willing to
[03:23:13.240 --> 03:23:18.440]  die but i'm not willing to lose so just spread the word about the show pray for us and buy the
[03:23:18.440 --> 03:23:23.160]  products dot nick beggars we love you uh go ahead and take over my friend with your great website
[03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:28.280]  and all you do uh there of course with earth pulse and all the work will put your website on screen
[03:23:28.280 --> 03:23:35.080]  brother hey alex it's always great uh to be supporting you guys uh you know that this thing
[03:23:35.080 --> 03:23:41.800]  is uh it is a battle you know and we have to take the risks um that uh that that we're driven to take
[03:23:41.800 --> 03:23:46.280]  and you know i don't i don't i've never felt fear and i know you haven't either and in 25 years of
[03:23:46.280 --> 03:23:51.800]  doing this together i've never felt fear because when you know that you're following the course
[03:23:51.800 --> 03:23:59.000]  that the creator has set out for you um man it's like the fearlessness of it it's the joy of it
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:04.760]  it's the engagement of it and are you not joining your father when you do this i mean like joining
[03:24:04.760 --> 03:24:11.160]  in his strength i do you know and i think about it uh you know i lost 50 friends in the last uh
[03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:16.040]  10 or 12 years uh good friends and i think about them and i think about my dad i think about
[03:24:16.680 --> 03:24:23.400]  how much they contributed to my life and my frame of reference and actually the ideas the thought the
[03:24:23.400 --> 03:24:28.360]  energy of all that flows through me um in the same way it does with everyone they touch because
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:33.160]  that's the nature of the human spirit that's the nature of the consciousness that we are connected
[03:24:33.160 --> 03:24:38.840]  to that's why we are making a difference and that's why fearlessly uh we get up and do what we do
[03:24:38.840 --> 03:24:44.920]  every day and and it's a joy to do it it's it's a calling it's uh i mean i can't think of a better
[03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:50.200]  place to be uh than to be talking about the things that are fundamental to who we are is and i know
[03:24:50.200 --> 03:24:53.800]  you personally i'll give a lot of spiritual strength how do you deal with the overpowering
[03:24:53.800 --> 03:24:58.920]  with the overdrive i get these positions where i've got so much energy now and so much dialed in
[03:24:58.920 --> 03:25:06.120]  i'm not bragging i can't handle it you know um i think that it's a matter of uh how do you channel
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:12.760]  your internal uh force you know and what i learned uh for me my gift is my voice uh what i do with my
[03:25:12.760 --> 03:25:19.400]  voice and how i use my voice and so i channel all that energy into the to what comes through me
[03:25:20.120 --> 03:25:26.600]  and what people feel when i speak is exactly that um and it's intended i mean i want people to know
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:33.080]  that it's not just a bunch of ideas but those ideas have a foundation and values and those values
[03:25:33.080 --> 03:25:38.600]  have a foundation in the essence of what we are and that's my hope is that if we can stimulate
[03:25:38.600 --> 03:25:44.440]  that remembrance of what we are then we win this war because then we have the foundation under which
[03:25:44.440 --> 03:25:49.960]  we can take the enemy is obsessed with telling us how much we suck and how we're bad when it's
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:55.880]  it's not true we're amazing it is it is not true and it is the biggest lie of all you know and
[03:25:55.880 --> 03:26:01.880]  you know when i think about what we are is created human beings in the image and likeness of god
[03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:07.880]  what does that mean exactly and i talk about this on this program from time to time that is the highest
[03:26:07.880 --> 03:26:16.840]  uh thing in creation and so we have this um idea that somehow uh self-condemnation continually
[03:26:16.840 --> 03:26:22.840]  um is somehow good and and i consider that almost blasphemy the idea of condemning our own soul our
[03:26:22.840 --> 03:26:28.840]  own spirit we can recognize our weakness we can recognize our failings but those are the points
[03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:33.960]  where we learn from that we're like a father with a child when your two-year-old does something you
[03:26:33.960 --> 03:26:39.080]  forgive it immediately and you teach you learn you nurture and you learn through the mistakes
[03:26:39.080 --> 03:26:43.880]  that we make and through the victories that we have the creator treats us no differently so
[03:26:43.880 --> 03:26:50.440]  self-condemnation um is blasphemy we need to recognize what we are we need to improve who we
[03:26:50.440 --> 03:26:54.520]  are and we just see the divinity in each person that we know and by the way just in closing
[03:26:54.520 --> 03:26:58.280]  someone had me take over what you're saying so true to our bank baggage is that christ
[03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:02.760]  literally was saying you're empowered you're free as long as you choose good and love god
[03:27:02.760 --> 03:27:06.840]  you don't have to keep beating yourself over the head the devil's an accuser telling you you're
[03:27:06.840 --> 03:27:11.400]  falling and bad i know you're falling but but just admit it and then move forward pass to get
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:17.080]  behind me satan and that's so critical because the the corrupt evil system tells us all day how
[03:27:17.080 --> 03:27:23.080]  we're inherently bad and how we suck and how we can't fix things that's a lie that is a lie and
[03:27:23.080 --> 03:27:27.880]  you know it's a battle of um the flesh of the physical form what i call our carrier you know
[03:27:27.880 --> 03:27:33.880]  that actually carries our soul carries our spirit um and we get confused because the world would like
[03:27:33.880 --> 03:27:39.480]  us to think that this body that has changed every cell in it has changed since we uh were first
[03:27:39.480 --> 03:27:44.600]  conceived and from when we were first born into and took our first breath we are not the same
[03:27:44.600 --> 03:27:50.680]  physical form that we were at our birth and yet we're intact because the real form of who we are
[03:27:50.680 --> 03:27:55.880]  is the essence that we are that we project through this physical form with all of its limits and all
[03:27:55.880 --> 03:28:01.240]  of its restraints and what the earth does is try to drag us into full identity with form
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:08.440]  forgetting the spiritual nature that is the core of who we are this is why this is so fundamental
[03:28:08.440 --> 03:28:13.000]  we start with our core we work outward and we change the world that's right we are not flesh
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:20.200]  we are spirit that is exactly it and if we start to function that way we are fearless in what we do
[03:28:20.200 --> 03:28:26.680]  because eternal life is really that and this is a grain of sand on the beach of existence this time
[03:28:26.680 --> 03:28:31.640]  on earth that's right and the enemy has bet on temporal power on this earth that's why they're so
[03:28:31.640 --> 03:28:38.040]  upset right because we're winning we're waking up and people are recognizing the truth that's right

[03:29:56.200 --> 03:30:00.680]  and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements
[03:30:00.680 --> 03:30:04.760]  in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits
[03:30:04.760 --> 03:30:08.520]  the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why
[03:30:08.520 --> 03:30:12.440]  they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last
[03:30:12.440 --> 03:30:16.280]  few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people
[03:30:16.280 --> 03:30:19.480]  like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the
[03:30:19.480 --> 03:30:25.320]  left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements and he claims her supplements
[03:30:25.320 --> 03:30:31.480]  no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because
[03:30:31.480 --> 03:30:35.400]  they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[03:30:35.400 --> 03:30:39.960]  by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it
[03:30:39.960 --> 03:30:43.960]  and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature
[03:30:43.960 --> 03:30:49.560]  but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info or store dot com or
[03:30:49.560 --> 03:30:58.280]  triple eight two five three three one three nine thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago
[03:30:58.280 --> 03:31:03.000]  that when our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground
[03:31:03.000 --> 03:31:07.720]  close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the
[03:31:07.720 --> 03:31:14.040]  communist chinese have banned all us farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in
[03:31:14.040 --> 03:31:19.560]  polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure on
[03:31:19.560 --> 03:31:25.400]  our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so
[03:31:25.400 --> 03:31:30.360]  to the walking cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us
[03:31:30.360 --> 03:31:35.080]  to back down we're never going to give up and all you've done is a wake of the human spirit
[03:31:35.080 --> 03:31:40.280]  and the human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners
[03:31:40.920 --> 03:31:45.480]  whatever you do spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the
[03:31:45.480 --> 03:31:58.280]  resistance we are 1776 worldwide last night i'm on info wars dot com and i read chris pratt
[03:31:58.280 --> 03:32:04.760]  criticized for t-shirt choice it is literally the shirt that i envisioned a betsy ross but also
[03:32:04.760 --> 03:32:10.840]  another just classic american flag all 50 stars with the gadson snake super imposed over and on the
[03:32:10.840 --> 03:32:15.320]  back america's back info wars dot com but what's better than just an american flag about a don't
[03:32:15.320 --> 03:32:19.400]  tread on me under the flag take don't trail the american flag it's a perfect combo so great minds
[03:32:19.400 --> 03:32:23.080]  think alike i mean whoever designed that shirt we'd already come up with the exact same similar
[03:32:23.080 --> 03:32:28.920]  design it is the don't tread on me american flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist
[03:32:28.920 --> 03:32:33.800]  of the shirt worn by chris pratt but it's a you know battle tattered flag like the one that flew
[03:32:33.800 --> 03:32:40.200]  over for something and again on the back it says america's back info wars dot com four thousand
[03:32:40.200 --> 03:32:45.400]  of these babies and that's it so we've got the betsy ross version and the american flag version
[03:32:45.400 --> 03:32:51.000]  at info wars store dot com be printed in the usa right now info wars store dot com they'll be right
[03:32:51.000 --> 03:33:07.480]  back the most banned broadcast in the world you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:07.480 --> 03:33:22.920]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's nick baggage you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:27.640 --> 03:33:34.280]  and welcome back to one info wars i so appreciate being here today and it's good to be uh
[03:33:34.280 --> 03:33:38.840]  with everyone and it was nice to be with alex for a few minutes at the beginning of this
[03:33:38.840 --> 03:33:44.120]  broadcast this friday and uh you know alex is so right about a lot of this you know and
[03:33:45.320 --> 03:33:50.520]  you know and i think back on um what happened uh with dad and it's been in my mind uh lately for
[03:33:50.520 --> 03:33:56.760]  variety reasons i was in june oh yesterday uh shooting a segment um were actually the travel
[03:33:56.760 --> 03:34:01.080]  channel interestingly enough they're doing some things on alaska may flew me down there for the
[03:34:01.080 --> 03:34:05.720]  day and you know talking to these guys about sort of the remoteness you know and i asked
[03:34:05.720 --> 03:34:10.680]  myself did you get out to remote alaska and they said oh yeah we got down to kenai which is kind
[03:34:10.680 --> 03:34:15.320]  of funny actually if you live here because it's on the road system and it definitely is not the
[03:34:15.320 --> 03:34:20.040]  wilderness so i suppose you might feel that way if you come from great britain which is where these
[03:34:20.040 --> 03:34:25.720]  guys were from um but as i thought about you know flying into june which is uh the route my dad took
[03:34:25.720 --> 03:34:31.320]  when he um disappeared and i always think about him and congressman boggs so when i make that flight
[03:34:32.040 --> 03:34:36.440]  and i was thinking a lot about what's happened in alaska what's happened in our country quite
[03:34:36.440 --> 03:34:43.560]  frankly um with the democratic party and what's happened there would be a big disappointment i
[03:34:43.560 --> 03:34:51.160]  think to my dad uh he was a more conservative democrat as many used to be i mean there used to
[03:34:51.160 --> 03:34:57.320]  be southern democrats at a different view of the world my dad um had more of a affinity that
[03:34:57.320 --> 03:35:02.360]  direction but he did care about people a great deal indigenous people in particular um and had
[03:35:02.360 --> 03:35:07.880]  a passion for the poor because he grew up poor um you know immigration is a big deal too you know my
[03:35:07.880 --> 03:35:12.440]  dad was a first generation i'm a second generation that my grandparents came in the front door on my
[03:35:12.440 --> 03:35:17.720]  dad's side and by the early 1900s on my mom's side they came in the front door in the 1880s
[03:35:17.720 --> 03:35:24.440]  and you know i know how hard my grandparents worked you know i knew them i knew all all four of my
[03:35:24.440 --> 03:35:32.440]  grandparents and um they lived into their 90s and when i think about how they lived my grandfather
[03:35:32.440 --> 03:35:37.960]  never really spoke good english you know i had a great education uh my dad's father my dad succeeded
[03:35:37.960 --> 03:35:43.880]  made it to the united states congress coming in the front door is the right way most of us have
[03:35:43.880 --> 03:35:48.280]  a heritage that i'm speaking about where our families did come at and indigenous were here
[03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:54.360]  i'm sure they had a different view of of immigrants than uh than we do probably similar the one we
[03:35:54.360 --> 03:35:59.800]  have today but nonetheless we are where we are you know and i think about the tenor of the country
[03:35:59.800 --> 03:36:06.840]  you know the discussion of reparations come on you know i mean do i deserve reparations because
[03:36:06.840 --> 03:36:14.680]  two thousand years ago the romans um came into croatia and wiped out my family you know come on
[03:36:14.680 --> 03:36:19.800]  at what point um do we recognize that what has happened in the past is certainly to be learned
[03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:25.800]  from um but there is a timeline you know and no one's living today that was a slave in america
[03:36:26.360 --> 03:36:31.800]  but there are people living today indigenous people living today that remember what it's like
[03:36:31.800 --> 03:36:38.680]  uh to be abused you know in alaska americans native americans until the 1920s couldn't become
[03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:45.080]  american citizens now think about it we bought alaska in 1867 the treaty of secession for russia
[03:36:45.720 --> 03:36:50.040]  russians were allowed three years to either go back to russia or they were automatically american
[03:36:50.040 --> 03:36:54.200]  citizens they didn't speak english they didn't have to write or read or write english but native
[03:36:54.200 --> 03:36:59.320]  americans had to read or write english read and write english they had to have two white people
[03:36:59.320 --> 03:37:04.280]  testify that they could read white english and then they had to renounce their religion
[03:37:04.280 --> 03:37:10.120]  and renounce their language and at the time and up until the 1960s we took these native children
[03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:15.400]  five years old took them out of their homes and sent them off to boarding schools this happened here
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:21.080]  my friends people i know this happened to them now imagine you being jerked out of your house
[03:37:21.080 --> 03:37:26.040]  of five years old thrown into a school and beaten every time you spoke the only language that you
[03:37:26.040 --> 03:37:32.280]  knew this is american indians these are indigenous peoples of alaska and this is what happened here
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:37.880]  civil rights in alaska one of the first states to engage civil rights because of
[03:37:37.880 --> 03:37:43.640]  paradovich native american woman here in the 1940s took that issue on was brave enough courageous enough
[03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:49.720]  some of the first civil rights law in alaska as a state my dad was involved in the 1960s
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:56.840]  you know we care about people and we do care about immigrants we just want it to be on a
[03:37:56.840 --> 03:38:02.840]  foundation of law and order because that's what our country is in fact based on and in that immigration
[03:38:02.840 --> 03:38:09.400]  wave it wasn't about bringing your country here it was about coming here and adopting to our way of
[03:38:09.400 --> 03:38:14.520]  life the same way when i traveled other countries i accept the rules and way of life i don't complain
[03:38:14.520 --> 03:38:21.240]  about their cultures or how they function if i have complaints then i don't go you know i recognize
[03:38:21.240 --> 03:38:26.600]  the differences around the world and appreciate those differences and i i acknowledge when i
[03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:32.120]  travel to places that i have to conform some places i don't go i don't travel in the middle east
[03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:39.160]  i'm not willing to um because it's too risky for me um there's a lot of places i don't go there's
[03:38:39.160 --> 03:38:43.240]  other places i've been in war zones i don't have a problem with that hang on the nature of the war
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:49.640]  um but i've been in a lot of places and um when i think about all of it and i think about what's
[03:38:49.640 --> 03:38:57.880]  possible this is what encourages me is the possibilities of change are so immense when
[03:38:57.880 --> 03:39:03.160]  people recognize the power of what we are individually and that's what i was alluding to and speaking
[03:39:03.160 --> 03:39:11.400]  to with alex in the last segment is this is where we begin to reshape and reform the world around
[03:39:11.400 --> 03:39:17.240]  this when we first change the way we see it and then begin acting accordingly um with the faith
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:22.040]  and confidence of a created human being that knows what you are that knows who you are and has the
[03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:27.960]  ability to engage and so we all can do that and what i say to people is do what you believe you
[03:39:27.960 --> 03:39:34.520]  can do and be successful at that's the step of knowing and believing and trying not succeeding
[03:39:34.520 --> 03:39:39.240]  all the time but trying all the time and when you fail learn from the failure don't be so
[03:39:39.240 --> 03:39:43.800]  self condemning learn from the failure grow from the failure and that is where the best
[03:39:43.800 --> 03:39:49.400]  that's where the best of our lives come from is in the trauma of our experiences and i i spoke
[03:39:49.400 --> 03:39:53.880]  about my father's disappearance of 14 years old he disappears off the face of the earth and you
[03:39:53.880 --> 03:40:00.920]  want to talk about trauma i had one older sibling she was uh 15 and then i had four younger siblings
[03:40:00.920 --> 03:40:07.640]  down four years old six of us my mother was in her mid 30s six children my dad disappeared
[03:40:07.640 --> 03:40:15.480]  that's trauma but let me tell you what happened from that trauma for me it was the most important
[03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:22.920]  transformative event in my life let me say that again my dad's death and disappearance was the
[03:40:22.920 --> 03:40:30.680]  most important transformative event in my life because it changed me fundamentally it made me
[03:40:30.680 --> 03:40:38.920]  question deeply what this world was really about it what my dad couldn't do in life he did by that
[03:40:38.920 --> 03:40:45.800]  act of death because i became a very serious 14 year old and anyone who knew me then will tell
[03:40:45.800 --> 03:40:51.880]  you that i gave up childhood from my perspective deliberately at that moment and decided i could
[03:40:52.520 --> 03:40:59.960]  be empowered i could make a difference i could take the example of my father and recognize
[03:40:59.960 --> 03:41:06.120]  is what an individual could do and he passed away at 40 having achieved more than most people do at
[03:41:06.120 --> 03:41:14.280]  80 and um you know i think that's an example for all of us he grew up for he uh it wasn't about money
[03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:23.480]  it was about integrity ideas and service this is the foundation of good government ideas service
[03:41:23.480 --> 03:41:31.160]  conversation respect accountability these are the things of good government what we're seeing is
[03:41:31.160 --> 03:41:38.760]  polarization tribalism and the worst of the worst the separation division along racial lines being
[03:41:38.760 --> 03:41:47.480]  amplified by the left this is not the country that any of us uh want to see built this is a
[03:41:47.480 --> 03:41:52.600]  country that has always accepted people on their face for who they are and what they're willing to
[03:41:52.600 --> 03:42:01.320]  do we're a country of immigrants for sure but please let's recognize the law let's build a
[03:42:01.320 --> 03:42:06.760]  foundation let's recognize what we can do together in the world and do it but also recognize the
[03:42:06.760 --> 03:42:11.560]  cultural and sovereign differences and their boundaries because the world cannot change
[03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:18.120]  overnight and it won't it's a timeline and we're in that timeline we've been predicting what's
[03:42:18.120 --> 03:42:22.760]  happening the technocracy is here we're going to get more into that in the next segments
[03:42:22.760 --> 03:42:29.640]  um this is dr nick baggage we're with info wars and really the info wars we're all in it together
[03:42:29.640 --> 03:42:34.280]  let's fight this war and let's win it this is dr nick baggage we'll be right back after these messages
[03:42:34.280 --> 03:42:45.240]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[03:42:52.760 --> 03:42:58.680]  before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and enforce dot com but
[03:42:58.680 --> 03:43:03.480]  also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info wars
[03:43:03.480 --> 03:43:09.080]  store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember when
[03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:14.840]  alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomere support
[03:43:14.840 --> 03:43:21.160]  with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[03:43:21.160 --> 03:43:26.600]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomere so i started looking into dna force plus
[03:43:26.600 --> 03:43:32.440]  but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing other
[03:43:32.440 --> 03:43:38.360]  competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went
[03:43:38.360 --> 03:43:44.920]  but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is
[03:43:44.920 --> 03:43:51.080]  on sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus
[03:43:51.080 --> 03:43:57.400]  at infowar store dot com george arwell said that in a time of universal deceit telling the truth
[03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:02.280]  is a revolutionary act and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the american flag because
[03:44:02.280 --> 03:44:07.160]  we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it but now

[03:44:15.960 --> 03:44:21.720]  flags this is the bizarreness of the america hating we're seeing so now it is a revolutionary act in
[03:44:21.720 --> 03:44:26.920]  the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the american flag particularly

[03:48:34.440 --> 03:48:41.000]  time i'm going to be broadcasting with uh info wars uh alaska you know i was thinking about a lot
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:45.880]  of this before the show you know what do i really want to uh touch on today and we started talking
[03:48:45.880 --> 03:48:51.960]  about sort of the human spirit and really i'm going to fold in on that and kind of abandoned what i
[03:48:51.960 --> 03:48:58.920]  was going to do because i think that is a foundational and i was in a conversation um recently um
[03:48:59.640 --> 03:49:05.480]  about the idea of slavery right and and it got me to think about sort of where did all this begin
[03:49:05.480 --> 03:49:11.240]  you know um in the beginning of the country there were two sources of labor really there was uh
[03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:17.720]  indentured uh servitude these are poor people uh whites and others just poor people uh coming
[03:49:17.720 --> 03:49:22.440]  from europe that had no money so what they would do is someone would pay for their passage they
[03:49:22.440 --> 03:49:26.920]  would come into the united states and then for seven years they were essentially a slave they
[03:49:26.920 --> 03:49:32.760]  called them in indentured servants um and you and you gave up your labor you exchange your labor
[03:49:32.760 --> 03:49:37.880]  for the ability to be there and so for seven years you were essentially their slave and at the end of
[03:49:37.880 --> 03:49:43.160]  that you were you know let go and you could go off and do your thing and hopefully you had a good
[03:49:43.160 --> 03:49:48.040]  arrangement and maybe you got a little parting money or something uh to get started but that's
[03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:52.840]  how people came into the united states the other way was on slave ships and we know the history
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:58.440]  of that and the horror of that um but if you go back in time even further go back a couple thousand
[03:49:58.440 --> 03:50:03.800]  years um to the time of the greeks and they were the same there were a couple kinds of slaves you
[03:50:03.800 --> 03:50:10.200]  know there were slaves that were captured and that were you know put in chains or sent into the arena
[03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:16.440]  um and then there were what they called wage slaves now that's where that word comes from
[03:50:16.440 --> 03:50:20.840]  wage slaves these are people who worked for wages they got paid a little bit of money
[03:50:20.840 --> 03:50:25.960]  but they didn't own anything you know per se they didn't have those four factors of economic
[03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:30.040]  production they had only one and it was labor they didn't have capital equipment things that
[03:50:30.040 --> 03:50:34.600]  built things they didn't have land and natural resources they maybe weren't entrepreneurs
[03:50:34.600 --> 03:50:38.200]  but they certainly had labor and they exchanged their labor and that's they participate in the
[03:50:38.600 --> 03:50:44.120]  economy and as a medium of exchange they gave them coins and so they were wage slaves but because
[03:50:44.120 --> 03:50:52.040]  labor was so connected to your physical form your humanity that in the united states after the civil
[03:50:52.040 --> 03:50:59.320]  war there were attempts to create income tax but that was considered slavery right to tax the labor
[03:50:59.320 --> 03:51:06.440]  of a human soul uh come on that's slavery that's how how it was viewed um and so what what happened
[03:51:06.440 --> 03:51:11.080]  is this all went to the us supreme court the us supreme court said yeah that's right you can't do
[03:51:11.080 --> 03:51:16.600]  this and so we had actually a man the united states constitution in order to get an income tax
[03:51:16.600 --> 03:51:23.160]  that created a class of people now authentically wage slaves so that's who we are today we're wage
[03:51:23.160 --> 03:51:28.760]  slaves for the federal reserve system using their fiat money as our medium of exchange
[03:51:28.760 --> 03:51:34.760]  as we go to our cubicles every day and are the drones for the new world order this is not changed
[03:51:34.760 --> 03:51:41.080]  since king george the only difference is a modern technocracy to administer it this is the difference
[03:51:41.080 --> 03:51:47.000]  of the 21st century is we have a technocracy one that i predicted 25 years ago would emerge on the
[03:51:47.000 --> 03:51:52.200]  planet we have it here today and this wasn't predicted by some esoteric means it was by
[03:51:52.200 --> 03:52:00.360]  review of the literature hundreds of thousands of bits of information were called a hundred thousand
[03:52:00.360 --> 03:52:08.920]  documents read i read them 20 000 thrown into my archives at one point um you know it was a
[03:52:08.920 --> 03:52:14.920]  distillation of a lot of knowledge that leads one to clear conclusions you know the facts take us
[03:52:14.920 --> 03:52:21.800]  places um and that's what what i saw all those years ago when i think about um where we are today
[03:52:21.800 --> 03:52:27.720]  within this technocracy and what's happening the idea of keeping people in this constant state of
[03:52:27.720 --> 03:52:35.240]  agitation whether it's the media throwing the standard ads on badminton body odor uh drugs
[03:52:35.240 --> 03:52:40.360]  that you that are going to kill you if they don't kill you you know i mean all of this uh fear
[03:52:40.360 --> 03:52:45.160]  mongering through the media whether it's the news broadcast or the commercial so everyone
[03:52:45.160 --> 03:52:52.600]  functions on sort of this low level anxiety this is not what the highest creation in creation
[03:52:54.120 --> 03:53:02.680]  was meant was meant to be some worms suffering in the ground no no that's not us you know we
[03:53:02.680 --> 03:53:08.760]  have to take back who we are and i would say this in all of your prayers ask for grace for goodness
[03:53:08.760 --> 03:53:15.320]  sake because the shortest route to change as a matter of fact is trauma you know the verse spare
[03:53:15.320 --> 03:53:23.400]  the rod spoil the child god does that to us too you know the rod is trauma of life the rod is the
[03:53:23.400 --> 03:53:32.280]  challenges we face it's not to hurt us it teaches it's not to damage us it's to raise us up into who
[03:53:32.280 --> 03:53:39.240]  we are and what we can be we're not wage slaves we're created human beings we are not meant to be
[03:53:39.240 --> 03:53:47.480]  under the ground at the feet of some elite group that somehow out and outrank us no we share the
[03:53:47.480 --> 03:53:57.640]  same rank in the universe all of us we engage the universe differently all of us we are the cells
[03:53:57.640 --> 03:54:05.000]  in the body each critical to the function of the body no matter which cell it is that is who we are
[03:54:05.720 --> 03:54:12.680]  the church is not some building full of hypocrites no it's not the money changers at the temple no
[03:54:13.480 --> 03:54:22.280]  the temple is the human body that holds our spirit from which we create the world around us
[03:54:22.280 --> 03:54:28.760]  we are co-creators with the creator and we need to create deliberately with intention
[03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:33.400]  with our full engagement and emotion if we're going to change the way things are and not
[03:54:34.040 --> 03:54:44.840]  and not in violence not as the antifa crowd hidden masks violent act against the human soul
[03:54:44.840 --> 03:54:48.520]  no matter whether you agree with that soul or not this is fundamentally wrong
[03:54:48.520 --> 03:54:54.920]  I hope whatever happens in Portland next week when I'm in the Bush's piece I hope people recognize
[03:54:54.920 --> 03:55:01.480]  that to stand up and believe in something is fundamentally our right and to disagree is our
[03:55:01.480 --> 03:55:10.040]  right the idea of silencing speech is so un-American the opposite is what is required it's simple if
[03:55:10.040 --> 03:55:15.320]  you don't agree with someone you change the channel you turn down the volume you draw your
[03:55:15.320 --> 03:55:23.480]  attention elsewhere you don't turn off your opposition and put your head in the sand that
[03:55:23.480 --> 03:55:30.680]  is not how you do it you know and sometimes the mainstream is wrong you know in the early 1960s
[03:55:31.640 --> 03:55:41.880]  97% of scientists believe that the earth changed gradually over time and then someone said hey
[03:55:41.880 --> 03:55:47.160]  what about continental drift maybe there's this theory and 97% of the scientists said the guy was
[03:55:47.160 --> 03:55:55.960]  wrong they just chastised them sounds a lot like climate science today doesn't it science isn't a
[03:55:55.960 --> 03:56:02.200]  pole science is fact and the facts are pointing us in lots of different directions in the world
[03:56:02.200 --> 03:56:09.480]  today and the media and politicians think that science is a political issue and that it can be
[03:56:09.480 --> 03:56:17.720]  shaped and massaged by focus groups and spin like genders can be created out of thin air you know
[03:56:17.720 --> 03:56:25.480]  the stuff that's going on in the mainstream today creates confusion anger and division the opposite
[03:56:25.480 --> 03:56:31.480]  of what we need in this country now we need recognition of truth we need open debate and
[03:56:31.480 --> 03:56:37.480]  vigorous debate we're at the point we're at the 11th hour we're at the point of trauma where we
[03:56:37.480 --> 03:56:44.600]  are going to learn the greatest lessons of this life we are at the two minutes to midnight deadline
[03:56:44.600 --> 03:56:50.600]  for us to wake up recognize what we are and begin to act accordingly and this isn't in anger and
[03:56:50.600 --> 03:56:57.720]  this isn't in violence is with the pure confidence that by the grace of god go we change the world
[03:56:57.720 --> 03:57:07.720]  change the world change ourselves change the people around us by recognizing the need to to be to
[03:57:07.720 --> 03:57:13.480]  exist within this earth to be good stewards to this planet and to one another that's a tough
[03:57:13.480 --> 03:57:18.200]  challenge you know that's the biggest challenge of all the started in Genesis that challenge
[03:57:18.200 --> 03:57:23.640]  and here we are at the beginning of the end of the age the beginning of a new age a different age
[03:57:23.640 --> 03:57:29.400]  and we're going to mine lies from our minds and our souls and our spirits to take it all back
[03:57:29.400 --> 03:57:39.560]  this is dr nick baggage and you've been listening to the info was changing the way we see the world
