[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  It's Sunday, February 3rd, 2019. I'm live.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  And so is our great crew in here.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  Even though we're in the age of a form of blasphemy,
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.000]  I'm going to do a live radio news program on the Holy Day of the Super Bowl.
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  I've been doing the Sunday show now for 12 years.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  A weekday show for 20-plus years.
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on Super Bowl 53.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  The Patriots versus the Rams.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  And already the leftists are telling us during the half-time show
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  there'll be lots of pissing on America and taking knees and all the rest of it.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  But, nevertheless, after the show, I will drive over to my parents' house
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  and eat some grilled hamburgers and hang out with them while the game is on in the background.
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.000]  It's about a gift football itself, and I totally get it.
[01:12.000 --> 01:13.000]  In fact, I just love football.
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.000]  But when you realize your whole country itself is being destroyed
[01:16.000 --> 01:21.000]  and that past times like the NFL that's lost about 40% of its viewers
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  are now, on average, these anti-American, anti-gun, anti-family engines
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  of nanny state more and more, it really takes the fun out of it, doesn't it?
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  But I don't blame you for going and watching the game.
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  In fact, I'm rooting for the Patriots because you've got Michael,
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  the self-propelled stomach morb, and the leftists all demonizing it
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.000]  because the owner and the coach and the star quarterback, the Patriots,
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  won't demonize President Trump
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  and won't, under their bullying, turn their back on him.
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  And so I really respect that, and you got to respect their winning streak as well.
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  I think they're like the most winning team ever.
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  So I will be watching the vaunted Patriots hopefully defeat the Rams.
[02:02.000 --> 02:07.000]  But I personally won't feel bad if they lose because it's a simulation
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  so that I, as a man, don't think about life of my children, business,
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  being involved, being informed.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  So I go and learn all the players and learn all the angles,
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  and it uses my military brain for a simulation like football instead of for real life.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  So my computing power is not for vestigial bread and circuses
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  on record designed to get men not to be men.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  Because full-grown men playing games, full-grown men being the heroes
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  because they play games, is a diversion from the real world.
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  I'm not saying anybody's bad for watching it, anybody's bad for even being obsessed with it,
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  but I went to a restaurant this morning with my wife and my youngest daughter
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  because other kids were visiting every other weekend with her mother.
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  And I just, it's all, anyone was talking about it, all the men were like,
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  I like this player, I like that player, and it's just all I heard.
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  Meanwhile, the very existence of our country is in crisis.
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  And the area of your brain that knows how to understand football scores
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  and players and knows who they're married to and all this crap,
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.000]  that's the area of your brain meant for knowing where your kids are at
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  and knowing how the three branches of government work.
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  Because I know all these men that, man, they're experts on golf and football and baseball
[03:26.000 --> 03:29.000]  and soccer or whatever it is they're into,
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  but they don't know anything about anything else.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  And it's really sad that we traded out Americans being known for
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  knowing how to build things and do things like the Wright brothers
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  and Henry Ford and how to be explorers and fighters and inventors.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  Those were all our heroes, trailblazers,
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.000]  but now it's steroid heads on average who are arrogant and completely mentally ill.
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  So there's one thing that's really narcissistic and that's professional sports.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  Okay, I'm done with my opening salvo there.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  I'm done talking about it,
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  but we'll get into the left saying we're going to take knees during the halftime show
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  and all this other anti-American crap.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  We'll get into some of that, but when we come back,
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  I am super loaded for bear today.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  A lot has happened.
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  I don't like to make myself the center of the show,
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  but Jack Dorsey, owner of Twitter, has come out
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  and said some crazy things about myself, the president and others,
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  on the Joe Rogan platinum line establishment broadcast
[04:42.000 --> 04:48.000]  where CEOs go for a safe space to tell as many lies as they can.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  That's all coming up and a lot more.
[04:52.000 --> 05:02.000]  Oh, I haven't scratched the surface, believe me, stay with us.
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  It's pretty good, but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.000]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[05:31.000 --> 05:32.000]  That's been incredible.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that,
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine,
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  but chemists, scientists and others showed us the research
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:53.000 --> 05:56.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it,
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  it's an incredible discovery.
[05:57.000 --> 06:19.000]  X3, now available at m4slive.com.
[06:19.000 --> 06:28.000]  Here's the news today.
[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:32.000 --> 06:47.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:47.000 --> 06:56.000]  Sunday, February 3rd, 2019, live coverage of Super Bowl 53.
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  53 and beyond.
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  We've got some coverage of Super Bowl 53 coming up for you,
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  but let me just, for radio, listeners and TV viewers who are tuning into the most censored,
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  most lied about, most demonized broadcast in the world, literally,
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  dozens of TV programs with characters based on me that are total frauds
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  and thousands of news productions on broadcast television and cable news,
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  lying about me and hundreds of thousands of news articles
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  the last three years putting out nothing but this information.
[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  Let me tell you, there's a reason they want this broadcast shut down,
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  this battered, bleeding transmission.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  And the wounds never felt so good.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  It's because, ladies and gentlemen, we have the globalist number.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  That means their blueprint, the cut of their chip.
[07:47.000 --> 07:56.000]  We know the dimensions, the width and depth and spectrum of who we're dealing with
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  and they listen to it and we know more about them than they know about themselves
[08:00.000 --> 08:05.000]  and they get really freaked out and say, make it stop.
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  Well, it's not going to stop.
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  No matter what happens to Info Wars or myself,
[08:10.000 --> 08:16.000]  it's just going to continue on and on in the animating struggle for liberty.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  And I see a lot of evidence that things are turning the corner.
[08:19.000 --> 08:22.000]  Let me just tell you what's coming up today.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  This is not in order of importance because I've been sitting here for like 30 minutes
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  before I went live saying, this is all too insane, what do I hit first?
[08:30.000 --> 08:35.000]  The halftime show's going to be a bunch of taking a knee America's evil crap
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  and you'll see other antics during the Star Spangled Banner.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  So that just shows who's running this country still.
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  You know, the NFL's lost 35 to 40% of its viewers the last couple of years.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  They just can't stop carrying out their mission, the globalist against the country.
[08:51.000 --> 09:02.000]  Jack, the owner of Twitter, Dorsey has come out and made more bizarre statements about yours truly
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  and about the president where he playing those clips.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  That's coming up extremely revealing.
[09:08.000 --> 09:17.000]  The president has come out and criticized Virginia Governor Ralph Northam,
[09:17.000 --> 09:23.000]  who is a new candidate to be the replacement for Baghdad Bob.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  Remember Baghdad Bob back in 2003 when fighter bombers were dropping bombs
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  about a mile behind him and mushroom clouds are exploding from thousand pound bombs?
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  And he's saying, we have defeated the Americans.
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  We have driven them back to Kuwait. They're all dead.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  And half of Baghdad had already fallen.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  Well, it's the same thing out of this guy.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  First he says, okay, it's me in the black face. I'm sorry.
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  Then he says, it's not me, even though it's a whole page about him.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  Now there's photos of him in the same yearbook wearing the exact same checkered pants.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  It doesn't matter, folks.
[09:57.000 --> 10:05.000]  It's a diversion and a distraction from him on television last week saying,
[10:05.000 --> 10:12.000]  we keep babies alive after birth and then kill them so they can harvest their organs.
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  That's the big story here as Senator Ted Cruz and others have pointed out.
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  I don't care what color you are. You don't need to be killed so your organs are taken.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  So we're going to be delving into all of that.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  But see, this is one of those stories that I call a skeleton key or a rosetta stone
[10:32.000 --> 10:39.000]  because it opens so many avenues and so many venues into understanding it
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.000]  because not once, not twice, not three times.
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  I personally, this morning while I was on the elliptical at 7 a.m.,
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  thought instead of watching Fox, I'll watch CNN to see if the Chiron
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  again says that the governor of Virginia is a Republican.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  We have the video, at least three cases that we've caught on video,
[11:00.000 --> 11:09.000]  bigger than Dallas, they're still doing it, saying he is a Republican.
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.000]  You understand the criminal commitment to lying CNN is.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  So that was a big battle that was last year in that runoff election,
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  that off year election.
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  That whole thing was a huge battle over Northman beating the Republican narrowly
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  and it was supposedly this big bellwether for Democrats
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  and then they all know he's a Democrat and they're saying he's a Republican.
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  So see, that's just the level of the deception
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  because they're not going to get in trouble for that
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  and their average brain dead viewer believes it.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  In fact, we have an extensive video on infowars.com
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  where Caitlyn Bennett, one of our great reporters went out
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  and the majority of people on the street, because it's unedited,
[11:54.000 --> 12:00.000]  it's just the clips back to back, believed that the governor is a Republican
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  and that he and Trump are both in the KKK.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  Now, do I need to explain to folks that the KKK was literally founded
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  by the Democratic Party in 1866
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  and that of all the famous people that have served in government
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  that were KKK, it's Democrats.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  But again, that's the inversion of reality.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  It doesn't matter.
[12:30.000 --> 12:37.000]  Just say it enough and you've got these idiots out there who believe it
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  and CNN is going to cater to whatever they want.
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  Remember, CNN is preying on you and your family.
[12:44.000 --> 12:49.000]  When you tune into it, it's just, I mean, one time they put up a chiron on me
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  saying, KKK leader, Alex Jones.
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  And they're all just testing, like, just don't believe me,
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  you can go to Google and just type in Alex Jones, CNN KKK leader.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  And I'm up there on Mount Benel giving a speech about Trump winning the election
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.000]  and they're so pissed, they just say, former KKK leader praises Trump
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  for appointing Bennett, Alex Jones, infowars.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  What the hell?
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.000]  But see, that's how they roll, folks.
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.000]  And I had a guy in a restaurant this morning, when I went to the bathroom,
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  I'm walking out, he walks up and he goes, you know, I love homeland.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  The guy's like shaking.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  He's like, are you really like that guy?
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.000]  And I said, that's a TV show, dude.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  I don't have time to watch it.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  So I've seen a few episodes, it's total crap.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.000]  He's like, I just, it's just like ran off.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  I mean, and I had that happen last week, people believe I'm the character
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  because it's based on me, they admit it, but they lie.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  They say I've got hundreds of employees with fake computer banks
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  just putting lies out constantly.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  So they hit me with fake fiction, they hit me with fake news.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  You've got to ask, why are they doing that?
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  Because it's part of a bigger plan and when we return,
[14:17.000 --> 14:26.000]  we've discovered the plan that affects every man, woman and child on this planet.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  Every man, one child, we have them.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  We have the smoking gun that could bring them down.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  We'll cover it when we come back and then we're going to get into Venezuela.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  We'll collapse now.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  Everything's turned against Maduro.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  I predict he's gone within three weeks.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  That's my prediction.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  We'll see if I'm wrong.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  I've got about a 97% accuracy rate and I told you Trump would declare an emergency
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  a few months ago or he should, but he got advised not to and backed off,
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  but I predict that the Democrats are going to stonewall again
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  and Trump will do an emergency if he does the right thing.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  But remember, I told you about national emergency before it was even in the news.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  Before it was even being discussed.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  We do our homework.
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.000]  So that's all coming up as well.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  And then some other really crazy stuff we're going to be breaking down.
[15:08.000 --> 15:14.000]  Party of no, once opposed, Democrats now backwars just to thwart Trump.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  And now Democrats are actually want longer prison sentences for black people.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  No, I've got articles.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  They're like, no, no, no.
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  Well, of course the Democrats passed the law to give blacks three times the prison sentences.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  And Hillary said they're dogs.
[15:29.000 --> 15:33.000]  She said like, like wild, wild predators.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  They must be learned alpha predators.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  They must be brought to heel like a dog.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  And it's just like, wow, wow.
[15:44.000 --> 15:52.000]  But see, doesn't matter because shows like Homeland have had it where all the Republicans are KKK.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  And people watch that and they believe it.

[20:00.000 --> 20:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:28.000 --> 20:33.000]  You know, I try to control myself.
[20:33.000 --> 20:39.000]  And it was one thing yesterday to see articles on infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com
[20:39.000 --> 20:46.000]  with the actual videos of CNN saying that the governor of Virginia is a Republican.
[20:46.000 --> 20:53.000]  But this morning, I wanted to see it for myself, so I'm watching cable and I flip over while I'm on the elliptical
[20:53.000 --> 20:59.000]  to CNN and sure as hell they did it again.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  Those articles are on infowarstore.com.
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.000]  And I'm going to be talking about that with one of the writers from Big League Politics,
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  the group that broke the big story on the medical school annual and more.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  And he also manages one of our TV stations we're on.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  So we'll be joined by our guest coming up in the next segment, Mr. Papert.
[21:18.000 --> 21:25.000]  So I look forward to that coming up, Tom Papert with KCTV, KCTU, Wichita,
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  where we're basically neck and neck to be number one TV station after one year on their station,
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  24 hours a day, very, very exciting.
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  So Mr. Papert's going to be joining us.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  He also writes for Big League Politics that broke all this.
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  So that's coming up.
[21:39.000 --> 21:45.000]  Now, they don't want us on air, so we'll point things out like that.
[21:45.000 --> 21:52.000]  We were the first to point out that the school kids from the Catholic school in Kentucky,
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  the Covington kids, didn't start the fight.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  They had the fight started with them and did a great job standing down,
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  which most of us couldn't do.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  Took a lot of courage, took a lot of will, took a lot of wisdom
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  that we don't seem to see in adults these days.
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  Now, how is all this happening?
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000]  How are you seeing unified corporate media with all the same headlines
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  in the same order over and over again?
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  I'm about to drop a huge bombshell on new listeners.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  Regular listeners are going to say, Alex, we know all about this.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  Well, hey, let me tell you.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  This is coffin nails to the system.
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  Congress gets involved in this.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  The president takes action against this.
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.000]  It's game over.
[22:39.000 --> 22:46.000]  So this got pointed out by some of our researchers, Harrison Smith,
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  and I went and looked it up and sure as Hades,
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  I'd read the executive orders, I'd read the bill two years ago,
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  two and a half years ago that Obama signed,
[22:55.000 --> 23:01.000]  and I'd forgotten that it elapsed and it ended last week.
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.000]  And that's why there were all the giant layoffs at dozens and dozens
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  of major leftist, globalist propaganda outfits like Buzzfeed
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.000]  and Huffington Post and others.
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  And more huge ones are set to be announced this week.
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  Now, why is that?
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  Dr. McCam shot please for TV viewers.
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  This is out of the public affairs, the Washington Post.
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.000]  2013, Obama gets law passed legalizing CIA,
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  engaging in deception against the American people.
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  U.S. repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  Now, let's continue.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  Just giving you a background here,
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  because hiding in plain view Obama signed that executive order.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  They passed a defense bill that he signed in December 2016,
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  so two years and three months ago.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  And it gave billions of dollars,
[23:56.000 --> 24:02.000]  tranched out in 100 million, 200 million packages for what you've seen.
[24:02.000 --> 24:06.000]  So when you see all the TV shows demonizing Trump and Alex Jones,
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  and you see every Netflix show, and you see Homeland,
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  and you see Comedy Central,
[24:11.000 --> 24:17.000]  and you see the opposition on literally dozens of programs
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  just against me, fiction, nonfiction, everything.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  Megan Kelly, all of it, and $76 million contracts.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  That was $2 billion of taxpayer money, and it's all right here.
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  This is the scandal of scandals of scandals.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  And Trump was set to sign executive order to kill it, but he never did.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  Well, guess what?
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  Obama could only put defense spending out two years.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  That's how it is.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  So he signed in funding against Trump and America
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  for all the disruption you see, not just against me,
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  but the taking knees and the cop killing groups and Black Lives Matter.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  That's all. We have the documents funded to destabilize the country.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  So think about how huge this is,
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  and no one's reverse engineered this but us in zero hedge.
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.000]  So U.S. repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans,
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  and it continues on from there.
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.000]  The NDAA legalizes the use of propaganda on U.S. citizens.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  Business Insider.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  Austin American Statesman.
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.000]  U.S. Senate panels OK funds to fight online propaganda, 2016.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  And it says $160 million in the effort over the next two years,
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  starting in late January when the defense authorization rolls over 2017
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  and rolling for two years just ended last week.
[25:49.000 --> 25:52.000]  Boom. That's just one of the funding groups.
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  And that's why those groups shut down.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  They were on record getting the money out of the Department of Defense.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  The left suddenly loves the Department of Defense.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  They suddenly love wars.
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  They suddenly love keeping them blacks in prison with three times the time that whites get.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  They're the ones that passed the bill in 93.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  They're the KKK.
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  They're the baby organ harvesters. They're the bad guys.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  And the Blue Blood Republicans are just scared of them.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  Well, aren't you scared too?
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  You've seen what they do to me or anybody else stands up to them.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  The answer is stand up though because it's better to fight than live on your knees.
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  So Obama quietly signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  They list all their enemies as Russian with no proof,
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  and then engage in covert operations with the Department of Defense and CIA
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  with select groups they've chosen interfacing with trusted members of the press
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  to counter the foreign enemy.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  And I did a live report on this last night where I played the congressional hearings
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  where they said Alex Jones is a Russian agent.
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  The proof, I'm gonna up the hearing, they just do it.
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  HR 5181, that's the defense bill.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  Go read it for yourself. It's law.
[27:06.000 --> 27:14.000]  And now all the giant layoffs happen because two years ran out and the money is gone.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  Vice is laying off all of them.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  So there you go.
[27:20.000 --> 27:26.000]  So that's how the Cal ate the cabbage and I thought all of you might want to know
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  what really happened.
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  And quite frankly, I'm not a glutton for punishment, but if I need to fight, I will.
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  I'm proud of this audience and I'm proud of this crew who have gone up against
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  the hijacked U.S. government and the Pentagon and the CIA
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  and everything they can throw at us with disinfo lies,
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  they're gonna be platforming, taking our sponsors, taking our bank accounts,
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  hitting us up one side and down the other, black ops teams, surveillance teams,
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  harassment you wouldn't believe and things I can't even get into on air,
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  Mueller trying to set me up, everything else.
[27:59.000 --> 28:04.000]  But you know what? I'm not out there with a bunch of guys freezing to death going over the river
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  and going to take on a German group of forces four times bigger than us like George Washington.
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  I am blessed to sit here in this studio and be able to go through psychological warfare
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  and punishment and a lot of it's not fun, but this is 21st century warfare.
[28:17.000 --> 28:22.000]  I am blessed to do something that's just 10% of what my forebears did.
[28:22.000 --> 28:29.000]  It's a lot easier than having my shoes fall off of me and dragging giant, you know, guns
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  that weigh 10,000, 20,000 huge guns from Ticonderoga through the snow
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  with people freezing to death and dying to beat the bloody British.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  So this is easy.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  As long as you back us, you've got to commit then. I know it's going to get rougher.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  It's going to get physical. That's the next phase and I'm ready to take my licks.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  But just know this, we're winners. America's winning and it's coming back from the dead
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  and the criminals that have hijacked our government, the funding Obama put in is running out right now.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  They're out of gas and we just hit the second wind.
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  Listen, I'm just going to tell us or something right now.

[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  and then they do a bunch of advertising and promote it.
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.000]  The tumor in this is 95% curcuminoid.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  Nobody else has that bright yellow school bus color.

[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  breaking news, intel, you name it.
[30:42.000 --> 30:46.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles,
[30:46.000 --> 30:50.000]  to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  but the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter
[30:53.000 --> 30:57.000]  at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[30:57.000 --> 31:00.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding. There is no set stasis.
[31:04.000 --> 31:07.000]  There is no managed system. There is no un-continuum.
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.000]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  We won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  We'll turn the whole thing around. Our grandchildren on Mars bases
[31:19.000 --> 31:22.000]  and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say,
[31:22.000 --> 31:26.000]  you know, we struggled here, we made it. And that's really where this goes.
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler
[31:32.000 --> 31:35.000]  and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[31:35.000 --> 31:39.000]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  and are also ready to fight. You don't go to the next level
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  without getting a big weight put on your back.
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.000]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[31:49.000 --> 31:53.000]  I want to go to the next level. I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced,
[31:53.000 --> 31:57.000]  not these devil worshipers. They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  I want life. I want Jesus.
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.000]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.000]  Introducing pollen block.
[32:05.000 --> 32:10.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.000]  eye comfort and respiratory function.
[32:17.000 --> 32:22.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.000]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.000]  a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[32:42.000 --> 32:47.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[32:47.000 --> 32:52.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[32:54.000 --> 33:21.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[33:25.000 --> 33:36.000]  Coming to you live from the infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  Make no mistake, we are the real resistance.
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  We've helped recapture part of the executive branch
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  and have gotten key toe holds, key beach heads.
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  In the fight we take the country, but the war is far from over.
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.000]  And that's why we're being targeted and attacked by criminal networks established by Obama
[33:59.000 --> 34:00.000]  before he left office.
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  And the incredible news is, it's starting to get picked up by researchers.
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  It's starting to show up in major publications that, hey,
[34:07.000 --> 34:13.000]  Obama's put $2 billion in the giant $600-plus-million-dollar defense budget
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  for 2017 before he left office to battle Trump supporters and to censor the Internet.
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  And now it's all come out.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  Think about how incredible that is.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  So I was thinking earlier, what do you even call this?
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  It's so sensational.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  It's so scandalous.
[34:30.000 --> 34:38.000]  Obama, funding of fake news to counter Trump just ended?
[34:38.000 --> 34:46.000]  Or Obama signed legislation funding fake news attacks on Trump.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  And the money just ran out?
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  Or learn why the layoffs are happening?
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  Obama secretly funded them and the money ran out.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  I don't know how you come up with a word with our tax money
[34:59.000 --> 35:04.000]  given to all these leftist, sorrows-approved jerks.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  And again, Obama's in office a couple of years,
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.000]  signs an executive order, gets a law passed to do it.
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.000]  Then it all happens.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  And then it happens in live time in congressional hearings.
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  And I experience it myself.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  Why didn't Trump sign an executive order to repeal it?
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  Why didn't he reverse it?
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  Word was he was going to do that.
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  Doesn't matter.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  Now it has expired.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  And you still got the sorrows funding and other things.
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  But the point is, they're running on fumes, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  We're hitting our second win.
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  And we've just got to do the right thing and commit to this.
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  But listeners have to understand, we are domino number one
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  and they believe they can take us down.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  They can get everybody else.
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  Next hour after our guest leaves us,
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  I'm not trying to make myself Gonzo Journalism,
[35:51.000 --> 35:52.000]  the center of the story.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  Jack Norsey, owner of Twitter, was on with Joe Rogan
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  who has eight to one votes against his videos now.
[35:59.000 --> 36:00.000]  He used to be 90% positive.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  Everybody literally hates him.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  Everybody I know calls him Joe the Snake Rogan now.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  He just is unbelievable.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  But we've got eight to one anti-Joe Rogan votes
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  every time he attacks me, just like Vice did.
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  And something special is happening here.
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  People get what's going on.
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  They see through the propaganda.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  So don't buy the fake polls against Trump and the rest of it.
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  Big things are happening.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  So I'm very, very blessed to be here.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  We're going to go to our guest for the next couple of segments
[36:29.000 --> 36:30.000]  into the next hour.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  Then I'll get into all the news I haven't hit yet.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  But please remember, the one big checkmate against the global
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  is despite 30 platforming is we're on talk radio.
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  We're on TV stations.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  And we're at infowords.com and newswords.com with millions
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  of people coming in every day to read the articles
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  and spread the videos.
[36:46.000 --> 36:47.000]  And it's getting out there.
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  And that's why they're so pissed trying to shut down
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  our bank accounts, trying to take us off PayPal, which they did
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  because people are hungry for freedom and they want
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  to demoralize you.
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  They want to keep it around the speech.
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.000]  So go get a Alexandria Cortez shirt where she's a dog.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  And we have the headline, capitalist walk dog socialist
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  eatem aka Allah Venezuela, because she said she wants
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  to have Trump Jr. arrested for just tweeting that.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  She said, I have subpoena power.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  We'll throw your ass in jail.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  Just this is a flaming authoritarian.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  So we have a shirt where she's a dog.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  It has become a best seller.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.000]  Get the supplements.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  Supermail vitality is cold pressed herbs.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  Takes four times the amount of herbs to make it the normal
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  powder type that works as well as great.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  We have Anthroplex and a bunch of others that are excellent.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  Enforceware.com are even stronger with their,
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  but they're powdered.
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  It's different when it's cold pressed.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  We can't source it anymore.
[37:42.000 --> 37:43.000]  We're trying to fix that.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  So I said it was discontinued.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  It's still 50% off.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  Our new best selling product, Turbo Force.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  Turbo Force.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  It's a supplement to brain forces and utropic.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  This is total body pre-workout, total day use, clean
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  burning, next level energy drink, powder.
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  I suggest you only take half a dose the first time you take it.
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.000]  It's insane.
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  And it just came out a week ago already, 23 reviews,
[38:08.000 --> 38:09.000]  4.8 stars.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  Enforcelife.com or AAA-253-339.
[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  But without you, Soros and Hillary in the dirtbags will win.
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  And they have done so much to try to crush us,
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  taking our sponsors, not letting us advertise online,
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  demonizing us.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  Now taking five of our six merchant accounts,
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  but we got some backups.
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  I mean, they are in my business trying to sue right now
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  to shut us down.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  But we can hold out as long as you support us.
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.000]  So thank you.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  But we've got everybody needs fish oil.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  What it does for energy, your body, your brain,
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  your heart.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  For your children, we have honor roll.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  For adults, we have two different types.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  It's the best out there.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  Enforcewar.com.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  OK, let's go to our guest.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  And I appreciate him on short notice.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  I was like, wait, wait, our guest, Tom Pappard,
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  who is the manager at KCTU Wichita,
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  that carries us 24 hours a day on the sub channel.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  He's become one of the most popular channels.
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  They're already maybe the most popular.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  Now battles, bigger stations wanting it.
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  But the point is that Tom Pappard obviously is a busy guy
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  as a foot in both of those.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  But he also writes for big league politics.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  So I wanted to get him on because big league politics
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  broke the black face with the governor of Virginia,
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  Ralph North Ham.
[39:24.000 --> 39:28.000]  And it also broke the KKK thing from a tip from a citizen.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  So I wanted to get him on to talk about this.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  And why are we surprised another Democrat is running around
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  in a KKK outfit and or black face?
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  Because it's his photo page all about him.
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  And he's wearing pants.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  The black face is him.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  You can see it's him, his hands, his facial structure,
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  his hairstyle.
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  It's him in black face.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  With his buddy, I guess, in the KKK.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  Why are we surprised that a Democrat is obsessed with the KKK?
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  That's who they are.
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  That's who that.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  So first he admits it's him and apologizes.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  Now he says, oh, it isn't him, even though it's his page.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  And now, but don't worry.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  He keeps saying he's a Republican.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  So there's so many layers to this, Tom Papert.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  Thank you so much for having me on, Alex.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  And you know, maybe we shouldn't be surprised at all
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  because this is typical Democrats.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  You know, it's a cliche at this point.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  But yes, the Democrats are the real racist.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  And I do think that this story, this extremely viral story
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  about the guy's blatantly racist yearbook photo,
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  it would not be a story right now
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  if he did not endorse murdering babies.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  You know, that's how this guy got into the news to start.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  He said, yeah, what you do is he deliver the baby,
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  then you make it comfortable,
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  and the mother decides to kill it.
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  So you kill it.
[40:42.000 --> 40:43.000]  That's just all there is to it.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  I guess maybe the environmentalists like that
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.000]  because it's less recent.
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  Exactly.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  So it's now left from partial birth abortion
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  to now in New York trying to pass it to Virginia.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  We're talking post-birth abortion.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  Right.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  Which is murder.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  I mean, it's infanticide.
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  How on earth do you have a viable screaming, laughing,
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  crying infant and say, yeah, we're going to abort this?
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  What does that look like to these people?
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  I don't understand.
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  So I think that it was kind of a one-two punch this week.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  You know, really, it was four steps.
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  First, we have the guy come out and blatantly endorse infanticide.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  Then the next day, he has a press conference.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.000]  He doubles down.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  Says he has no regrets.
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  Day number three comes around.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  He's blaming racist Republicans
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  because clearly we just took his statements out of context.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.000]  And it's all our fault.
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.000]  We misunderstood him.
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  Then day number four, Friday, of course, Patrick Howley,
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  editor-in-chief at Big League Politics,
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  gets a tip from a citizen, confirms it.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  Racist, blackface, Ku Klux Klan photos.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  He admits it's him.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  Then the next day, oh, no, no, no, that wasn't me.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  I just put shoe polish on my face one time
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  to dress like Michael Jackson.
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  That's all I did.
[41:48.000 --> 41:49.000]  This photo isn't me.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  They've had members of the government there in Virginia
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  at the state level at the resign just over blackface alone.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  This is with a KKK guy.
[42:00.000 --> 42:01.000]  And look, here's the point.
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  I grew up as a conservative Christian,
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  abolitionist type background where people are ashamed
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  of that America was ever like this.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  But then any time I got around leftist,
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  they were the ones that were racist.
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  And it's just something that, quote, minorities don't know
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  who the Democrats are because the media has covered it up.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  And I think stuff like this is breaking through.
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.000]  You look at President Trump's support among Hispanics,
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.000]  and it's skyrocketed from 19% a couple years ago
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  up to 50% today.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  The Democrats for too long have thought that blacks
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  and Hispanics and other minorities,
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  I think they honestly think they're stupid.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  That's a form of racism, of course.
[42:38.000 --> 42:39.000]  And they're not stupid.
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.000]  They're brilliant. They're smart.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  They're Americans just like everyone else.
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.000]  Nobody said that only white California wine-drinking liberals
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  count in this country.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  They have brains, and they're starting to wake up
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  to all of this.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  And it's in no small thanks to Alex Jones and Infowars.
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  Thanks for this audience.
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.000]  Tom Papert, stay there.

[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents,
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  knew that they canned food during the falls
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  they'd have it during the winter.
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfowarsTour.com.

[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  because they're taking them right now.
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  We have seen what they want to do.
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  They want to pack everybody into the cities
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  It's The David Knight Show.
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  Never missed your show, any day.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  I mean, never.
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  EditForce.com forward slash show.
[47:00.000 --> 47:29.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  As long as we hold on, we win.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  No matter how painful, we hold the line
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  from the front lines of the Information War.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  It's a blessing to be persecuted by these people.
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  A new world order.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  All right.
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  I want to get back to this governor situation
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.000]  because I don't get into every big giant story that's out there.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  But you notice almost every time lately,
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  it's the Covington kids or it's this governor
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  where the system's outputting out.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  It's BS that all these babies, you keep them alive,
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  take their organs, no big deal.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  I double down on that.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  It blows up in their face.
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  Or going and bullying the Covington kids
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  and the whole media lying about it.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  The lawsuits they're about to get filed next week
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  blows up in their face.
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.000]  But it's then how corporate media responds
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  with CNN over and over again saying
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  the governor's a Republican when he's a famous Democrat
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  that they champion.
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  Not like it's some obscure city council member
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  and they got it wrong.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  After they get caught, they double down
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  because it's subliminal.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  I mean, face it.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  If you're a regular CNN viewer and believe that crap,
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  there's something wrong with you.
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  Support it.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  Here's an example.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  Paul Watson wrote about this on Friday.
[48:59.000 --> 49:02.000]  Google always says when they have trends,
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  so does Twitter, if it's a politician,
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  RD or independent or L.
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  So it's RD, L or I.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  Sanders is a really Democrat but it says I.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  Not a Connecticut.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  Magically, Paul wrote about this on Google
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  and on Twitter.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  Magically for the first time ever,
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  he didn't say what he was
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  because he was the top two trends.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  His KKK outfit if that was him
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  or the blackface turns out he's the guy on blackface.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Those were the top two trends on Twitter and Google.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  So guess what?
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  They run in real quick.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  Well, hell.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  Give CNN credit, Tom Papert.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  They go further.
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  They just add an R on there.
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  I mean, this is again,
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  the whole way they respond is a window
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  into the wanton, incredible deceit, Tom.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  It's almost like
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  a willful schizophrenia.
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  They live in upside down world
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  where only Republicans can be racist.
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  So therefore, Ralph Northern
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  must be a Republican.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  That's the only logical answer to this.
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  But obviously, it was just
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  an attempt to confuse their easily
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  led sheepish viewers.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  Obviously, it was not a mistake.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  That's everything is a mistake
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  and these mistakes only ever seem to hurt Republicans
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  and help Democrats over at CNN
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  and Facebook and Twitter and etc.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  It is just blatant lying
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  on its face. We actually caught that.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  One of our writers was watching
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  CNN and saw that happen
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  and we just all bust out
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  laughing at big league politics.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  It's so hilarious to us
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  that they think that America is this
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  dumb. Maybe a segment
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  is the potbelly goblins
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  who throw hot coffee at you.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  Maybe those guys are that dumb.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  Maybe they are low-hanging
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  fruit, but I think the average person
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  is getting sick of this and
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  if you don't laugh, you cry.
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  So I hope that they're laughing at it.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  Well, I've talked a lot about this.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  I've got an old family friend.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  He's known me since I was about 2-3 years old.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  I was best friends with her son until he died
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  from an infectious bacteria deal
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  when he had a surgery at a hospital.
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  That's another story.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  One of her grandkids
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  is a part black because her daughter married
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  a black man, a great guy.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  She was going to a major university in Texas
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  and was kind of a liberal buying into it
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  but before she graduated this year,
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  I guess now last year, they were saying
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  by the way, your final exam
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  is on KKK leader Alex Jones
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  and he's a Nazi and he hates black people
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  and he hurts people and all this other crap
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  and she got so upset
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  they threatened to kick her out and take her degree
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  and threatened her. Well, it caused
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  a total conversion
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  because she knows been on the boat with me
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  and been on campouts. I noticed she was a baby.
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  I've literally like given her a bottle
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  and she was like, what the
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  it was like it went so far
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  because they teach a curriculum now that I'm the devil.
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  I'm like this, they've
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  they've stolen my identity, created this new person
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  I'm not and the people that know me
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  it's like they're like, this is crap.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  Well, people say that you're
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  the homeland TV
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  show character from that is mocking
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  you, mocking Alex Jones.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  And it's like, no, of course, these people are totally nuts
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  and I do think that the academia
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  maybe they have fooled themselves
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  maybe they believe their own propaganda
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  they swallowed their own Kool-Aid and they believe it
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  but that is an excellent example
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  you know, I was similar I was just
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  Libertarian Ron Paul guy I went
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  to college and after four years of indoctrination
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  and then two years of
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  the Trump campaign and then the first year of his presidency
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  I became a hardcore Republican
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  and I'm or I don't even know if that's the right word
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  a hardcore conservative a Trump
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  conservative and I'm never looking back
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  they drove me further to the right
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  in a good way not, you know, crazy right
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  but they drove me further into
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  sanity is what I like to say and I do
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  have to add Alex big league politics
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  is the latest in the now we're the
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  racist club we had I'm not
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  going to give them credit but a leftist
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  rag well-known leftist rag
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  wrote an article saying, you know
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  the website that came up with this Ralph
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  Northam scoop their white supremacist
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  and they said because
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  we wrote some articles about Roy Moore
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  therefore we are
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  what's happening listen you've been
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  listed a big league politics is fake news
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  because you guys I'm quite frankly
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  envious but it's a good envy
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  I'm glad zero had you there I'm glad you're there
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  that makes me feel good but but I am envious
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  you guys keep breaking so much
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  huge news so obviously
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  your real media fake media
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  that saying that you know
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  the governor of Virginia is a Republican
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  they can't exist because you exist so they're angry
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  right I think
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  that is exactly right they're mad that they
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  can no longer lie it's the same reason
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  they have to kick us off social media it's the
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  same reason you're no longer allowed on network
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  TV nobody wants to have you on their show anymore
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  since Pierce Morgan looked like an idiot
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  after talking to you they know
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  that got voted by the LA Times
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  and a bunch of others it was the highest
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  rated show
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  he ever did his ratings
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  for two months and then plunged to nothing
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  after I came on and just like Megan Kelly
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  so they know booking me on national
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  TV top ratings they just
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  look but I'm not bragging
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  my cue scores are as high as they get
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  I mean the highest thing they thought was hot chicks
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  on Mexican TV but I'm
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  bragging it's just I have higher cue scores
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  than hot Mexican chicks on Mexican TV
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  which I'm sorry have the highest cue scores in the world
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  and I don't know why
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  you're telling the truth you're not lying
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  to people you tell them exactly what's going
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  on you don't dress it up with a teleprompter
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  and here is
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  what my PR agent says I should stay
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  you know no you just tell it exactly
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  but I'm not talking about me
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  they've made it about me and said
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  I'm fake and I'm a fraud no you've been
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  here you we didn't pre script we're talking
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  about this is just real people man
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  talking about real stuff like around the coffee table
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  that's what people want
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  we don't want racism
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  we don't want to fight with people we want to have a future
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  we want to be successful
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  and Hollywood is a poison
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  trying to make us fight with each other and I think
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  we're hitting the carry capacity I'm not just trying
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  to be positive here Tom I think the tipping
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  points already reach the globalist don't know
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  it yet but everybody I know
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  who's got any brain cells is just done
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  with MSM
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  ever since Kavanaugh Kavanaugh
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  then we had the Covington teens now we have
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  this ridiculous Ralph Northam situation
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  people are seeing over and over and over
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  again the media cannot be
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  trusted you have to look for alternative voices
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  and what better alternative
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  voices to go to than the ones that the media
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  you can't trust are demonizing go to
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  Alex Jones go to info wars go to big
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  league politics those are the people you
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  can trust and it's really easy
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  they make it super easy it's almost like they give
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  you a short list by the way we hate Alex Jones
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  we hate big league politics we hate
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  Breitbart we hate gateway pundits and so
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  it's just like telling viewers so maybe okay
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  I'll go check out Alex Jones then I'll check
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  out big league politics they're doing our work
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  for us we could not pay for this kind
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  of marketing
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  but see there's the paradox
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  then they sue you then
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  they try to take your bank accounts did you
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  see where I showed mainstream news
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  confirming Obama turned the CIA
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  loose on independent media and it's
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  particularly Breitbart info wars and
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  then they thought I was the weaker target because of my flamboyance
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  I mean this has been hell
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  but now the funding
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  ended last week so what are they gonna
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  do now
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  they am all off
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  it's been beautiful and I love the learn
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  to code movement you know when
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  when coal miners all throughout
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  the Midwest and the Rust Belt when coal
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  miners factory workers etc when they lost
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  their job because the global
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  has spent 30 years shipping their jobs
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  overseas power plan to do
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  learn to code and yet
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  when we tell them to learn to code
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  we get Twitter banned for it
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  oh but Jack Dorsey says that's an algorithm
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  which is total crap
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  you know the Nazis came to IBM
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  and they said our people don't like killing
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  people they did some test death camps in
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  like 35 long before Hitler launched
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  the final solution and Thomas
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  Watson of IBM said well
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  say the computer said
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  and then he was given the highest award even
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  above Hitler by Hitler and so he said
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  you just program the computer for what you want
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  and then no one feels bad when they're lining
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  men women and children up in pits and shooting
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  them because the computer said so Tom
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  that's exactly right you know
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  they always like to hide behind this mysterious
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  algorithm as though it were created
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  in nature and they just discovered it and
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  plugged it into their main frame and now
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  they're using God's own algorithm to
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  determine what is racist and what is hate
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  speech and what is not no of course not
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  it's made by a small group
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  of radical left-wing
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  programmers at all these social media companies
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  it's the same story every time and then it gives
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  them something to hide behind you know
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  I've run businesses before you run a business
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  you know how to manage this you get a series
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  of social media content moderators
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  and you say hi these 10,000
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  pages are your responsibility
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  we have the internal veritas videos
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  it's not an algorithm
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  they have an algorithm tells us
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  tells them what we're doing we'll be right back

[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  not worry about us and just keep
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  stabbing with the truth stabbing stabbing
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  driving towards the heart i think
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  we're gonna win we got two more segments with you
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  and then i'm gonna get into some really
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  insane news
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  i'm not into owning people
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  and victory laps but i realize
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  in this modern era when we
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  are owning people when they
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  have tilted board against us
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  like twitter like google
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  like facebook like vice like
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  joe rogan
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  i talked to some really smart people
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  and they said don't worry alex
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  this is gonna turn around
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  this is gonna blow up in their face
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  but i gotta tell you
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  they are really getting their ass kicked
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  right now and like you said the
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  the cavanaugh thing was
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  so ridiculous six accusers
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  five get caught lying
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  the six can't prove any
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  other all the witnesses say the opposite
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  and now it's just a chain reaction
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  i was just a questioner early on
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  compared to other people that got a forum
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  there were questioners before me
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  a lot smarter than me so they think trying
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  to restrict us people already
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  have the hunger they already get it it's a
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  stelter calls us a virus
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  well call that then a virus
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  the point yeah we're the virus to death
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  there's a chain reaction here i don't
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  think they can stop but let's be serious
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  how could the globalist
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  try to grab victory from the jaws
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  of defeat because i smell
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  their defeat
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  i think the number one
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  strategy that they're already using
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  is they want to make it so
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  you and i we can't do business they want
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  to make it worse than that they want to make it so
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  i can't get a credit card so you can't
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  open a bank account and yes
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  this is going to make people mad
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  yes this is going to open eyes
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  but what it's also going to do is scare
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  people out of entering
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  the arena it's going to keep people from
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  saying yeah i'm a writer for big league
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  politics or yeah i work for info wars
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  it's going to make them too terrified
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  to step in and people have to have
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  some courage here in the face of all
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  this because we've seen it we know
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  that it's mastercard that is going
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  to patreon and saying
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  you must drop these pro
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  freedom personalities or else we're
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  no longer going to process your payments
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  and that goes back to trump's
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  biggest failure is
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  they didn't go after the tens of thousands of patriots
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  christian groups veterans groups
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  FBI associations that are conservative all these
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  groups when he was in for eight years
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  persecuting him with the IRS
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  beyond nixon so they've been green lit
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  to do this and if we allow
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  this then we get what we deserve trump must take action
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  well and i have a theory
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  i think the president trump obviously he knows
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  about this he's received documents from
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  info wars he's received documents from a ton
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  of other alternative media personalities
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  showing exactly what the president
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  can do he knows what the problem is
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  he knows what the solution is but
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  they are letting president trump
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  remain the underdog
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  even while in office because when they can
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  go after you and they can go after
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  big league politics and they can go to
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  kctu and attack our local
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  advertisers and say do not give money to the
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  station because they they have a Nazi
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  on the airwaves when they can do
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  this type of stuff it makes us still look like the underdogs
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  we won two years ago almost
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  three years ago yet we are still
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  the fighting guys we're still
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  the people to root for it is immense
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  branding for the president
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  and i do have to join you though alexa
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  a lot of people in this media
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  in this alternative media world we are
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  financially and personally less well off
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  look at roger stone than we were
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  in november of 2016
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  tom i understand that that's been from people
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  but let's just say it trump surrounded
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  he's trying to do a good job and he's done
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  good on the supreme so many places he's done great
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  thank god he's there love trump
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  but
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  when it comes to not declaring the emergency and letting them
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  have the 30-something day shut down the earth economy
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  we should have done the right thing as original instinct
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  our instinct
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  let's just say it we're getting the hell
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  beat out of us here
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  but i'm not a wimp i'm not going to sit there and go
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  i'm going to quit because this is happening but
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  the president people want leadership and they
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  want action now and i get this whole
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  paradigm of you know let them persecute us it'll
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  make us stronger well well again
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  it's going to backfire because if
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  we aren't here alex jones isn't there
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  who does trump have to defend him
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  you know is it going to be bin chapiro
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  limbeck defending president trump i don't
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  think so that's what i'm saying is
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  persecution i'm ready to take whatever
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  happens we've had enough it's time to go

[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  from the top ratings out there as a sub
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  frequency KCTU Wichita

[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  after they're born and has a bill introduced
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  like New York pass
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  no it's that Alex Jones that wanted
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  legal reform so that blacks
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  didn't get three times longer sentences than whites
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  that Hillary got passed and called them alpha predators
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  that must be made to kill like dogs
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  jeez wow

[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  you make racist jokes
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  that all blacks all look the same
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  I don't think so
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  exactly she said we had to bring them to heal
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  Alex bring them to heal like their dogs

[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  you know it's a funny story
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  we had our VP
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  of programming a wonderful woman named Tracy
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  she got a phone call one morning at
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  730 before our business hours
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  even started from somebody saying
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  that she saw you endorse Hitler
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  at four in the morning and so we're like
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  what the hell are you talking about Alex Jones
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  there's no way that happened first of all
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  second of all I doubt Hitler's name was even brought up
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  we had a DVR we looked
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  we rewinded to what on earth was going on
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  because of course it's a repeat of the Alex Jones show
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  at four in the morning and we find out
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  that what it was this is the most hilarious
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  thing I've seen to date
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  you are comparing Hillary Clinton to
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  Hitler and because this guy
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  loved Hillary so much that must have meant
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  you were by association
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  endorsing Hitler because Hillary is so wonderful
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  so you must also like Hitler
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  these people are totally deranged
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  we have another guy he has a list
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  of all of our info wars advertisers
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  and he has called each and every one of them
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  and tried to get them to drop us
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  and they just laugh and say no we like Alex Jones
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  sorry click
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  but see that's the right
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  answer instead everyone else
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  grovels and bows down
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  when these people make up
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  anytime you go check it it's not true
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  it's like saying Trump says all Mexicans
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  are criminals he goes wonderful people
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  great people employ a lot of great Mexicans
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  of my companies but you got a lot of
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  criminals coming across illegally
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  and Mexico's sending its worst
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  in many cases which they admit
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  that turns into all Mexicans
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  are horrible BS man
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  and it's the same thing
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  they false brand
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  they do they pull the same trick
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  over and over and over again
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  and it becomes so transparent
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  so blatantly
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  illogical that again I think this is
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  waking more and more people up and they must realize
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  that they would not be ratcheting it up
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  the actual censorship
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  if they didn't realize that their trick is no
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  that's what you're saying is not only like
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  virtue signal that my grandfathers
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  were both in World War II but I literally
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  both of them almost died
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  okay in World War II
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  in the Army Air Corps both almost died
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  and were super guilty that all their buddies
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  died and they didn't die and then one of my
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  grandfathers when I get into the story my mom's like
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  don't be eccentric your grandfathers will look
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  eccentric he was a big lease on for oil companies
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  in New Mexico and Texas and back then
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  you could only go get something to eat at a military base
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  okay in like New Mexico or the Panhandle
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  in Texas and there was damn Nazis
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  everywhere and he used to get into it
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  with them because they'd shoot their mouths off
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  I'm almost dead because of Nazis
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  I didn't almost exist
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  my mother and my father almost didn't exist
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  because of them and then I get to have little pieces
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  of crap call me a Nazi
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  because it's their magic word when they're
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  funded the Democrats by a literal
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  Nazi collaborator
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  right who admits it who brags about it says
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  it was one of the happiest times of his life
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  no regrets at all
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  you know there's two ways to look at that one you can
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  say that's really weird
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  and two you can say oh you had no problems
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  with it now as an adult maybe when you're
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  14 you can buy it but my god
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  apologize realize it was terrible don't
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  double down but these are the people
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  we're dealing with and it goes back to the northern
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  situation where the man
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  dressed in either blackface or in a
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  KKK outfit I think he was probably the
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  Klansman because he says use facial
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  recognition software and that will confirm my innocence
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  well kind of hard to do that when you're
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  wearing a white hood over your head.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  White knows you can't do it off of an old black and white photo
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  I disagree he's wearing
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  if you've seen the pants it's on m4s.com
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  That's true. The pants are the exact pants
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  and you look at his hands are kind of spindly and long
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  and then there's photos of him
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  but look look it doesn't matter it's a page
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  about him it's the page
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  about Ralph Northam
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  in the damn book
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  he's the school president
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  right I mean he
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  he had nothing to say except
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  he did give them the other two photos
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  but he had no say in the yearbook the man
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  is the worst liar there's ever been you know you
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  can tell the difference between Alex Jones
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  telling a story about his family and this
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  guy admitting that he put black shoe polish
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  on his face to look like Michael Jackson
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  but no no no that's not
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  him in the other photo absolutely
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  insane and Alex I do have to
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  because I know we're running short on time I have to say that
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  I when all this
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  news was breaking this last week
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  I came down with a horrible god
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  awful sinus infection
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  and I asked my buddy at Info Wars Dan
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  Lyman you know what do I do there's all
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  this news I need to write and I
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  can't breathe and he told me colloidal
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  silver get the silver
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  bullet and you know what it worked
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  I wasn't quite sure but it worked
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  like a gym
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  well I'm glad you know Tom I never
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  plug so you get me to plug
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  our philosophy simple
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  we go out and we find out whatever is
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  already the best selling highest rated cleanest
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  best company knowing we're target that's
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  on our main reason it's secondary we want
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  you to have the best project anyway so it works really good
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  so we have what's rated the safest best
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  30 parts per million any more parts
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  per million gets a little toxic because
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  you know they'll kill bacteria and viruses
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  it's gonna be toxic folks like back like
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  antibiotics nothing's perfect antibiotics
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  you can overuse but they're still great
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  colloidal silver let me tell you
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  we sell the same one Jeff Bezos sells
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  at Whole Foods private labeled
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  top company they sell theirs on average 25 we
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  sells ours you know for average like 22
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  but it is the very best silver bullet
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  it's private label but the very same thing with
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  Jeff Bezos sells at Whole Foods and on
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  Amazon it's a great product and it's
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  morestore.com with a 98%
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  review out of
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  2647 reviews
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  4.9
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  stars
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  that that's from power reviews so I'm
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  glad you mentioned it topically in the body
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  whatever it isn't a silver bullet
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  it's as close to a silver bullet as you're gonna get
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  so let me ask you this
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  without getting too negative or too positive
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  you can be in a fight somebody starts it
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  you got them down but they do a left hook
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  right hook and knock you down
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  what is their ace in the hole
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  what are the desperate globalist and Dems
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  they want to plunge the economy
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  they want to cause racial division we know
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  what they're trying but what could be their
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  their do sex their sneak attack at gut level
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  you're a smart guy what are you worried
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  about let's not be too confident here
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  now we are all
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  being very confident right now because
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  we just had a massive series of wins
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  from Covington to Northam and it's
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  just keeps getting worse and worse for the Democrats
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  my fear is they're going to
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  somehow slip a poison
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  pill in they're going to get us
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  all to report something that seems
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  completely accurate probably according
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  to all the facts we can gain are
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  completely accurate and then they'll flip
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  it and they'll say aha
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  Democrats reveal X
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  and it will completely prove
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  quote unquote prove
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  that we are all fake news we're all liars
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  where everything they say about us so that is my fear
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  and I think they're right now as
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  conservative media is becoming
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  easily the most trusted outlets
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  on the planet because you can no longer trust
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  the mainstream at all this is when
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  our editors need to be going into
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  overdrive and I think they all know it because
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  I think that's what's going to happen they want to discredit
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  us they know that we are number one
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  in the hearts and minds of Americans
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  they have to change that they have to do it
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  fast and I don't know what it's going to look
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  like could be any day now
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  could be something related to
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Ginsburg there's a lot of rumors going on
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  with her and if a large conservative
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  outfit does something unwise
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  that could be the thing that does
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  a cascading effect that gives more advertisers
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  the opportunity to ditch conservative media
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  it gives more globalists the
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  opportunity to gloat we were right
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  and those Nazis were wrong again so
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  I that is my fear right now
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  they're going to do something they're going to
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  pull the wool over someone's eyes
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  get somebody to say something
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  bad and it will turn into sandy
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  hook 2.0

[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  we have found an extraordinary new
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  natural way to alleviate
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  seasonal distress symptoms including
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  promoting clear nasal and sinus
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  passageways, eye comfort
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  and respiratory function
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  in the 1960s
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]  researchers in France noticed that people
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  who ate certain quail eggs
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  experienced less seasonal immune
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  and inflammatory responses
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  they began studying this effect in published trials
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  and decades later we now
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  have the fruit of this research a fast
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  acting chewable tablet

[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  in fact current research
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  has found that it actually acts by
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  blocking the activity of triptase
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  and inflammatory responses in the body

[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  committed to bang heads with these people
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  and they just can't stand the fact
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  that they can't starve us out
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  and they can't make us run
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  and they can't intimidate us
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  because we can't give up on who we are
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  we can't give in and become them
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  and they don't understand that
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  they don't understand
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  because they're jellyfish
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  now let me get to this point
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  I'm not happy to have
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  to attack Joe Rogan
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  and
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  Joe Rogan is a very
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  passionate smart
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  charismatic guy
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  but Joe is highly driven
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  and
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  is really a dark person
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  and I think that comes from
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  an insecurity complex
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  being from a poor family
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  in
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  Boston
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  because you get smarter
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  as you get older you get wiser
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  and just the snapshots along the way
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  so I'm not attacking Joe Rogan
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  because
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  he had me on his podcast two years ago
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  and it was the number one podcast he ever did
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  and then he won't have me back on
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  I thought it was an ideal place
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  to address all the fake news
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  against info wars
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  and to speak the truth
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  and then
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  he kept putting out establishment
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  talking points last year
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  and really attacking me with exact
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  talking points
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  and then I found out he was sponsored by
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  George Soros
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  and we're going to get to that in a moment
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  this is really sad stuff
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  and I learned about six months ago
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  he was on the payroll
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  more money than the Young Turks ever did
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  the Young Turks got something like
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000]  20 million dollars from Qatar
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  Gulf State Dictators
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  this is really creepy stuff
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  and so when he said
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  George Soros fought the Nazis
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  he was a hero in World War II
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  it was just like man that's really sick
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  he was on 60 minutes bragging he helped round up Jews
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  so I called Joe about four months ago
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  and I said listen
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  this is bigger than Alex Jones and Joe Rogan
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  it's like a pilgrim's progress
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  or a tale of two cities
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  I said listen man
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  you don't have to have me on your stupid show
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  I don't care about getting on big platforms
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  I would have sold out
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000]  they don't want to put you in big movies
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  they want to put me in big movies
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]  I refuse their top contracts
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  because it's a sell out
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  sure I'd be big in movies
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  sure people watch me already
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  I don't need their system
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  I'm not a pedophile
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  sorry I'm ranting here
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  but I told him
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  I said you run your mouth
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  with George Soros talking points anymore
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  I'm coming after you because it shows you're working for them
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  he kept doing it
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  and then I got really depressed
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  because I realized
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  the only time I ever sold out in my life
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  strangely enough
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  because I've known Joe for like 20 years
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  crap longer than that now
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  God
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  and I have this
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  loyalty thing where
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  it's not a sell out but I'm like a dog
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  I'm so loyal
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  that even though somebody's not my friend
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  I'm still loyal because they said they were
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  I'm having to learn
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  to not do that when somebody
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  themselves isn't loyal
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  or they go off the reservation
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  this is going to take some time
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  because this is a big thing here
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  this is a big deal
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  so the things I saw with Joe
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  the things I discovered about him
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  you know
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  things that other people would never know
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  and things that I would never even
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  go after him for
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  and then he's so confident
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000]  cozyed up to google
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  cozyed up to facebook
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  on the payroll of Jack Dorsey
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  the word is
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]  it's like a $300,000
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  contract a month
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  which I've got news about it right here
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  why don't you disclose
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  we've got our sponsor
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  Cash App and Bitcoin
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  oh see Joe
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  see I never took
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  bitcoin as an advertiser
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  some of the radio stations I might have done it
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  because I thought it was a pump and dump
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  I felt like it was a scam
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  not that digital currency
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  or cryptocurrencies are bad themselves
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  but the whole thing always smelled
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  and I knew the globalists and sorrows
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  were involved
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  so I turned down the million
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  dollars a month
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  two years ago when I hit its peak
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  so you didn't
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  did you Joe Joe
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  and then you think you're going to sit there
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  and attack free speech and piss all over
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  America at the same time
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  you pull this stuff
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  and you've got a UT
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  approved research facility
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  in Austin
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  putting over a thousand people a year
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  through MKUltra and I've got all the names
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  the witnesses the women everything
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  and I knew this two years ago
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  but it was like so crazy I was like not looking at it
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  I was just like because
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  I almost sold out for nothing
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  it's like Joe had me under
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  a spell or something
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  but I never sold out
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  and so thank
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  God
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  at the end
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  of the day
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  I found redemption thank
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  God
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  I didn't go back on Joe's show
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  I never want to talk to Joe
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  I never want to see that little demon
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  I never want to be associated
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  with you I don't want to be associated
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  with selling out or failure
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  I just want to be away from you at LA
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  and that whole leaking
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  butthole that you are
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  excuse my French
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  that's the allegory that hits my brain
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  and it's not a hate of Joe
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  it's that a revulsion
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  I don't hate you Joe
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  I'm revolted by you
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  see the difference
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  you revolt me
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  that little oiled pimp
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  that little front man
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  of DARPA up there
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  like a rat, like a spider
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  cleaning its pinchers
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  ugh
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  you don't know the light
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  because you were never in it
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  thank God
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  people like Louis Goehmert looked at
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  Sundar Pachani said
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  you wouldn't know the light
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  because you've never been in it
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  and it's true
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  of course
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  the enemy when they launched their main
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  attack cannot be associated with me
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  because that's who they're
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  we should all rejoice we're not on Twitter
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  we should rejoice we're not
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  with Jack Dorsey this fallen
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  slave this nothing
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  look at him
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  he is a
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  shish kebab for the devil
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  just a little bite
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  sold out for nothing
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  another coward
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  and the good news is
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  when I come back
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  I'll get into all of it
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  because now
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  their average video
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  suddenly
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  has 8 to 1 dislikes
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  and everyone's turning against them
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  and it's happening everywhere
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  they're the sinking ship
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  humanity sees through them
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  the
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  vision was true
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  the
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  prophets were right
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  we win
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  they lose
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  listen I'm just going to tell this for something right now
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  I think our best products

[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  they put in a little bit of product
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  and then they do a bunch of advertising and promote it
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  the turmeric in this is 95%
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  curcuminoid nobody else has that bright yellow
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  school bus color that's what you're looking for

[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000]  broadcast is what brought the country and the world back
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  from the brick but the globalists now want
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  to target where the resistance
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  I want to be
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  troublesome and pesky
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000]  I want to keep going I want to make them
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  do the ultimate not just destroy us financially
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  I want to push all the way
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  I've committed to do that
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  I've prayed for that and I've been told

[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000]  experienced not these devil worshipers
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000]  they're cold and failed and feels like
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  being a tomb I want life I want Jesus

[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  and I wonder why
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  I don't despise
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  now all I can do
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  love what it's worth

[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  but it's all from your eyes
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  I dare to realize
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  alright
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  so the next two segments
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000]  because it's a journey into the heart of big tech
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  Silicon Valley
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  the journey into the collapsing corporate media
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  trying to reinvent itself
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  with the Trojan horse
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  that basically is Joe Rogan
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  he's pushed only after CNN
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  he's the number two pushed algorithm
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  on Google platforms
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  and then once he opened the door
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  in the last year for them to take over
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  when I talked to some of the people involved with him
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  he went and met with university ads
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  there's a think tank CIA
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  and they decided Joe's their weapon
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  well the human algorithm picked up on an instilling
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  so he's gone from an average 90% vote
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  to an average 8 to 1 vote against him
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  we can show that for TV viewers
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  if you're a radio listener on local stations
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  and who's Joe Rogan
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  well he's just a
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  he's Benedict Arnold
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  you heard about Benedict Arnold
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  back in the Revolutionary War
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  you heard about Judas Iscariot
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  you've heard about traders
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  I mean it's important to look at them
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  and understand who they are
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  just thank God we're not them
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  because these are all these fake
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000]  you know fake brave
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  wanna be tough guys
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  they're not the crazy brave
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  they're the fake brave
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  and I'm not taking pleasure in it
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  but if I'm gonna do it
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  I'm gonna stab hard you know what I mean
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  so forgive some of the viciousness
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  but it just has to be done right
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  you know what I mean
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  so let's do it right now
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  so you've got Jack Dorsey
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  this cowardly succubus
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  no one
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  this fallen degenerate filth
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  this nobody
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  this DMT
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  Prozac head
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  drug addict
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  micro dosing LSD
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  MDA drug addict
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  okay
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  so you've got this
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  this scruffulous rotting creature
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  who thinks we don't see
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  what he's doing
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  and thinks we're stupid
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  you've got him on with Joe Rogan
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  this fake pushed garbage feed
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  against the public
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  and since he began
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  George Soros fought Hitler
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  and cut his head off
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  in a battle in the bunker in 1945
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  I mean just cartoon land
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  Marvel comic stuff
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  everyone has turned against him
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  my son calls him Joe the Snake Rogan
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  strangely enough
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  people at the office were calling him Snake
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  but not like a Snake Plex
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  not a cool thing
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  so let's get into it
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  Twitter CEO tells Joe Rogan
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  he doesn't know why Alex Jones was banned
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  a lie
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  that video is on infowords.com
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  this is Friday's podcast
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tells Joe Rogan
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  Trump is no worse than Obama
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  what is that statement
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  he's scared of regulation
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  no worse
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  he's trying to end racist laws
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  against blacks for triple jail times
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  he's trying to pull us out of endless wars
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  he's trying to
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  oh yeah he's no worse
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  he's thinking that's like a nice thing he's saying
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  it's a lie
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  so there's those reports
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  but let's get into the meat and potatoes
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  because you know I always print stuff
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  in case they take it down
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  because Joe's got his moderators
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  deleting any videos critical
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  he has a Google interface
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  like the New York Times does
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  that's a whole congressional investigation right there
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  yeah Joe we know about it
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  you little handlers
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  but what's really big here
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  is that
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  all of his videos now are unpopular
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  they've gone from being 90% popular
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  to 8 to 1 unpopular
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  6.3k pro
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  42k
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  anti
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  now that was an hour ago
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  but if your team or you see it live
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  they're on screen
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  let's read
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  these comments document cam shot please
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  so here's the good news
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  no one is buying this now
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  thousands of comments
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  I read like a hundred earlier
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  I scanned over it
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  no one is supportive
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  everyone sees directly through it
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  and that's the human algorithm
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  that's what's beautiful but let me take the scandal
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  Joe Rogan when he's up there
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  pumping Bitcoin
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  that I told you 8 years ago
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  is a scam
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  and is a tulip
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  mania bubble
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  oh a psychotic sociopath
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  a satanist would say Alex you were dumb
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  you could have made a hundred million dollars
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  well that's a big number
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  no we bring in 40 million a year
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  but half that's product cost and every expenses
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  it's not that much
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  Buzzfeed gets 300 million a year in profit
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  100 million from Soros
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  and still can't make a profit
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  to be like oh my god 40 million
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  I need to support you 40 million
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  gross
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  explain this again
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  we have millions in bandwidth cost every quarter
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  I'm gonna stop
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  my goal
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  measuring my Johnson
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  my spiritual Johnson
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  is not how much money I make
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  it's how I take on these tablets
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  and change the world
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  and for changing the world with our audience that took action

[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  so
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  I'm not saying everybody involved in Bitcoin is bad
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  I'm not saying any of that right at the end
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  wanting a dead cat bounce
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  here comes
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  Jack Dorsey
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  and Joe Rogan's main sponsor
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  we have the press voices right here
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  they don't tell the viewers though
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  they just go in there
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  and they say
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  oh yeah I think Bitcoin's gonna go back up
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  oh here's where you go invest so it's really great
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  Jack Dorsey doesn't

[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  the potentiality of what we're gonna do
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  oh let's look at some more of these quotes
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  we'll come back and play some of the clips
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  Joe Rogan's
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  podcast is sponsored by Cash App
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  which is true Cash App is a product
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  made by Square Inc the founder
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  and CEO of Square is
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  Jack Dorsey
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  not telling you he's there selling you
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  a security on air because they think

[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  gotta love how Jack never answered
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  why Alex Jones was banned
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  also love how Joe never
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  asked Jack why celebrities
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  and SJWs weren't banned after threatening
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  the Covington's Catholic kids
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  Quitter and Facebook are the
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  downfall of already dysfunctional
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  society these psycho run

[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  of self importance
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  Joe 2016 outspoken
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  opinionated Joe 2019
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  cowardly worried about Hollywood status
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  read the thousands
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  of comments but most importantly
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  8-1 Dislikes
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  turn in the corner

[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  I can't wait to bang

[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  get to some more of these videos stay with us
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  you know we discovered deep earth crystals
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  a pure nascent iodine
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  and brought you X2 that's been incredible
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  now due to the establishment trying to block that
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  we did more research
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  of nascent iodine but
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  chemist scientists and others
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  showed us the research that by combining it
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  with three other compounds two forms
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000]  of iodine and vitamin C
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000]  it super charges it
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  and makes it even more
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  bio available ladies and gentlemen

[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  X3 now available at
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  we all know that the outside toxins in the water
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  it's compact in size easy to install and maintain
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  out of your water supply

[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  introducing pollen block
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  we have found an extraordinary new
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  natural way to alleviate
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  seasonal distress symptoms including
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000]  promoting clear nasal and sinus
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  passageways eye comfort
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  and respiratory function
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  in the 1960s
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  researchers in France notice that people
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000]  who ate certain quail eggs
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  experience less seasonal immune
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  and inflammatory responses
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  they began studying this effect in published
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  trials and decades later
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  we now have the fruit of this research
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  a fast-acting chewable tablet
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  symptoms pollen block is natural
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  and effective it is not
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  an antihistamine in fact current
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  researchers found that it actually acts
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  by blocking the activity of triptase
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  the immune and inflammatory responses
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  in the body go outside
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  and enjoy the air you breathe

[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  that when Joe Rogan started
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  endorsing George Soros
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  and all these lies and these Sandy Hook things
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  I didn't say that his audience
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  totally turned against him
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  despite being censored and shut down
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  the public got it they came through
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  I'm not taking pleasure in Joe
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  getting all this hate
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  but see he's just doubling down now
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  he opened the door
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  so now it's all these corporate CEOs
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  who have failures and then they're running
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  Bitcoin scams on the show
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  not telling people they're advertisers
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  in my view the federal
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  commissions
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  should look at this
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  because it's a fact I mean I wouldn't take the Bitcoin money
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  but that one
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  it's a dead count bounce
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  Jack Dorsey's
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  pushing a collapsed
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  fake commodity on
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  Joe Rogan's weed head viewers
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  because Joe is very scientific
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  he's like well I'm going to target weed heads
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  I think they're a bunch of loser idiots
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  they want to be manly ninjas I'm going to teach them
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  I'm their daddy so Joe Rogan's like the daddy
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  of the weed heads
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  and he brings in Jack Dorsey to gang rape
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  them together this is the manly thing
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  they do
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  I mean this is sick these are some sick
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  people
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000]  and so the listeners are pointing
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000]  out 8 to 1
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  attacks
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  in these videos and they're trying to
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  prevent it's not working
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  it's in flago
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  that you've got a major feeding
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000]  frenzy going on
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]  but I thought I'd actually play some of these clips
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  because it's such horsemen are Jack Dorsey
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  knew I was going to be banned everywhere
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  and decided to get more attention
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  for a few weeks before he banned me
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  and then Joe wants to really
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  kiss his ass because you know Jack
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  Dorsey's paying him the word is $300,000
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  a month and Jack wants
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  a major bump to get his viewers
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  to sucker into Bitcoin that's already collapsed
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  like these suckers will buy a dead cat
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  bounce and Joe's like
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  really? well I'm going to
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  he's looking at 10, 20 million a year
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  he just scams his viewers which he'll do
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  this isn't flesh lights
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  this isn't
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  this is an ayahuasca cult so this is
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  Bitcoin baby
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  so Joe's got his knife
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  sharpened for his fans who he hates
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  he's just sharpening
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  yeah yeah
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  so yeah it's hard to
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  to a stateness it's even sweeter
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  to sell him something totally failed
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  even when it's failed it's just
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  oh it's so sweet so
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  oh we love
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  our Somalis we love
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  our Muslims too
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  oh they're so good
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  oh they're so sweet
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  Joe's kind of an Islamist so
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  he's there and they realize
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  this is happening
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  and so how does he sell
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  Bitcoin scam
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  to his viewers
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  for $300,000 a month
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  how does he get
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  Jack Dorsey to get a million a month
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  how does he do it how does he do it how does he do it
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  so then Jack Dorsey
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  comes out on the show
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  and says he doesn't know why I was banned
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  off Twitter you were I was banned
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  because it was part of a large
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  Pentagon hijacked plan by Obama
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  with funding we already
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  covered earlier to shut me down
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  to set the precedent for everybody else
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  you know damn well with this
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  oh but on a magic algorithm
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  like Lucky Charms did it
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  so let's go ahead and go to Joe Rogan
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  and Jack Dorsey talk about Alex Jones here it is
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  I believe it's
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  something that everyone has a right to
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  everyone has a right to but you still
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  ban people like say like
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  Alex Jones you guys were the last guys to keep
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  Alex Jones on the platform
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  I believe you hung in there until
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  he started harassing you personally right
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  no no no he
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  he did not he came to your house
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  good pause start over
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  because Joe goes
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  Joe called me
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  like four or five months ago he's like
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  why are you banned
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  and I said well here there's a Pentagon plan
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000]  and Obama funded it
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  and he's like well I thought
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  the Pentagon likes you not the military
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  the people that run the Pentagon
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  I'm like trying to tell him he's like oh well
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  you're such a chaos agent
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  well I'm like listen I don't care Joe
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000]  fine I just stop saying
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  these these talking
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  points about Soros and me and
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000]  it is obviously paid off
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  so so again that's why I'm bringing this up
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  because he won't stop
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  lying about me
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000]  and so we'll play the
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  moment because you heard
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  you heard
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  the owner of
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  Twitter say oh no Alex
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  Joe didn't harass me I didn't harass him
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  I said thank you for claiming your first
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  amendment
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  but I didn't say use battle rivals
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  on the media that's made up
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  so that was the official story
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  we'll get to it in a moment but let's let's finish up
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  like Alex Jones
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  you guys were the last guys to keep Alex Jones
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  on the platform you were the last ones
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  and I believe you hung in there until
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  he started harassing you personally right
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  no no no he he did not
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  he came to your house he banged
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  no he uh
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  you know he he did very different things
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000]  on our platform versus the others
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  oh okay so we we saw this
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  domino effect over a weekend
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  of one platform
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  banning him and then another
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  another another in very very quick
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  succession right and
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000]  you know people
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  I think would have assumed that we would just
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  have followed suit but he didn't
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  violate our terms of service
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  and
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  afterwards he did
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  and and we have you know we have a we
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  have a policy and if
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  you know the there's a violation
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  we take enforcement actions
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  one might be asking
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  the account holder to delete the tweet
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  another might be
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  a temporary suspension another might be
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  a permanent suspension
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  so what you're saying is so like let's
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  use in terms of like him saying that sandy
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  hook was fake he did not say that on the
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  platform he did not say that on twitter
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  he only said that on his show
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  I don't know I don't know all the mediums he said
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  what did he do but what we're looking at
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  is the is the is a conduct
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  and what he did on our
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  platform so what did he do on your platform
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  that was like that you all
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  we're in agreement that this is enough
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  uh I'm not I'm not sure what
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  the what the actual like
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  you know violations were
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000]  but we have uh we
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  have a set number of actions and
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  if they keep getting
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  if if
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  if an account keeps
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  violating in terms of service
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  ultimately it leads to permanent suspension
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  and when all the other platforms are taking him off
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  we didn't find those we we didn't
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  we didn't find those violations and they weren't
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  reported but again it goes back to
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  a lot of our model people weren't
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  reporting
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  a lot of the tweets that may have been
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  in violation let's stop right there
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000]  uh
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  Darcy's just so you know in your little
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  meth head world I know what you're doing
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  I was the top story in those months
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  you just held off so you keep yourself the news cycle
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  and then ban us we didn't do anything it's all
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  crap you let islamicists
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  talk about cutting women's generals off
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  you harass conservatives everywhere you do whatever
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  you want you can't say
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  what we did because your lawyers have said don't
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  say anything because we have you
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  we have you
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  but your little butt boy Joe
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  is out there like oh he attacked
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  you right let's talk about that
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  so this is all lies ladies and gentlemen
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  they let leftists
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  do whatever they want on twitter threaten
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  murder people kill people
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  everything but they can't say what I did
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  because they looked at it there's nothing there
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  you just watch what I did
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  it's because what I say is so
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  true that they
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  can't deal with it so let's play a few clips
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  I'll cover this more on the weekday show tomorrow
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  we're almost out of time here we're like minute left
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  here but let's go to
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  Alex Jones confronts Jack Dorsey
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  about battle rifles because they said on the news
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  I said go kill media battle rifles
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  I didn't say that I never said that
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  I said if anything comes to your house be ready with your battle rifle
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  to defend yourself so
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  this is where I supposedly harass him
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  he's just hey please defend free speech
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  here it is
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  I appreciate your first amendment
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  but I have a right to face my accusers
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  Jack and I never threaten the media
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  with battle rifles
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  so
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  CNN's lying
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  is destroying
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  is destroying free speech
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000]  CNN
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  CNN and the Democrats
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  you know are destroying the first amendment
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  and needs to be stood up against
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  Obama set up a CIA
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  office to shut down independent press
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  in the US
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  so there you go ladies and gentlemen
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  Obama set up a CIA
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  office before he left to shut down independent
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  populist media in the US
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  and Trump knows it's getting ready to sign executive order
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  reversing it
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  but Trump didn't
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  so it just elapsed last week
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  and all the layoffs were happening
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  so I don't have time for these other clips I'll play it all tomorrow
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  but Oliver Darcy all of it
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  that's why they said they banned
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  this is a public figure calling for me to be banned
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  I say man you're an anti-American jerk
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  they go oh my god
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  you know you've got a 20 inch
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  neck and he doesn't
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  he's a good little slithering snake we're banning you
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  so
