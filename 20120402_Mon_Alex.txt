[09:09.160 --> 09:15.720]  let's just begin over here on my right hand side man whose wmd lies led to a hundred thousand

[09:33.560 --> 09:41.880]  being aired on bbc television curveball came after the white house and downing treatment mo's
[09:41.880 --> 09:47.480]  that we now have confirmed that they said we're going to fix intelligence with the office of special
[09:47.480 --> 09:58.200]  plans and make up lies and go and find people who will basically lie for us
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.720]  that is one article of probably 200 let me go to the next one
[10:09.240 --> 10:17.080]  opposition says syrian rebel fighters to get salaries bbc the uh the peaceful protesters
[10:17.080 --> 10:22.440]  that have rocket launchers and have been attacking syria and murdering people for a year and being
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.480]  called loving democracy activists are now to get public salaries funded by the u.s. government your
[10:27.480 --> 10:31.880]  money to overthrow the country and put al-qaeda in charge they've set on record and kill the
[10:31.880 --> 10:36.840]  christians the groups that the our government is funding are on record saying the first thing
[10:36.840 --> 10:41.560]  they're going to do is slaughter the jews and christians and muslim minority groups there in
[10:41.560 --> 10:48.120]  the country and saudi arabian government is funding it all as well publicly continuing
[10:48.120 --> 10:54.360]  nations pledge millions for syrian opposition a coalition of 70 partners including united states
[10:54.360 --> 10:58.680]  pledged sunday to send millions of dollars in communications equipment to syria's opposition
[10:58.680 --> 11:03.560]  groups they're just opposition groups you know that blow up police stations with bombs led by al-qaeda
[11:04.680 --> 11:09.400]  on record but al-qaeda is everywhere and i've got to get my rights up or they're going to get me
[11:09.400 --> 11:15.800]  i also coming up i'm going to spend some time on the nfl something i don't normally talk about
[11:16.440 --> 11:23.160]  because they're talking about criminal charges for the bounty program that by the way is going on
[11:24.200 --> 11:32.680]  in most nfl teams forever i mean i wasn't even a good football player uh and uh but you know did
[11:32.680 --> 11:38.520]  did play high school football and was in some games and they they put me on the field just
[11:38.520 --> 11:43.560]  because i would accidentally hurt people routinely just had the knack for hurting people and the
[11:43.560 --> 11:47.960]  coaches would salivate uh over the fact that many times i would just hurt people
[11:50.600 --> 11:52.520]  so uh that's going on
[11:54.840 --> 12:01.560]  i just had a knack for it uh and so now it comes out they were paid to hurt people
[12:02.840 --> 12:06.200]  and the the very justice department that ships narcotics into the country
[12:06.200 --> 12:10.840]  and the very justice department that ships guns into mexico to blame the second amendment
[12:10.840 --> 12:15.320]  and the very fbi crime lab caught framing thousands dr furtick whiter's the head of
[12:15.320 --> 12:21.000]  it went public and blew the whistle they're going to now be the good guys i guess and start
[12:22.280 --> 12:27.560]  start indicting players who would get ten thousand dollars if they hurt a star player like brett farf
[12:29.080 --> 12:33.400]  i mean that's nothing to these guys making ten million dollars a year it was just entertainment
[12:33.400 --> 12:38.600]  i mean that's what they've always you're always trying to hurt the quarterback
[12:39.960 --> 12:44.200]  i mean you might as well just indict the entire nfl in its history
[12:45.480 --> 12:51.720]  and vince lombardi dig his body up put it on display and send the the the the body of vince
[12:51.720 --> 12:58.680]  lombardi to federal prison because that's what you do in football is hurt the quarterback
[12:58.680 --> 13:07.960]  and anybody that says that it in the case isn't living on planet earth period
[13:11.640 --> 13:16.760]  it's just so ridiculous it's like that line from apocalypse now which is based on some of
[13:16.760 --> 13:23.400]  the famous writings of people that have been in combat folks like kurt vonnegut made these points
[13:23.400 --> 13:38.600]  and many others that we court marshal pilots who write cuss words on the sides of their
[13:38.600 --> 13:45.240]  airplanes or discipline them but then we have them drop fire bombs on cities full of children
[13:45.240 --> 13:55.400]  again it's this criminal government always running around acting like they're going after
[13:55.400 --> 14:00.440]  bad guys arresting willy nelson for marijuana trying to take willy nelson's house with the irs
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.800]  always targeting some high-profile person to get attention and scare people it's about fear mafia
[14:05.800 --> 14:16.760]  fear the fbi and atf barbecuing children at wake up the cia shipping narcotics in all right
[14:17.640 --> 14:21.080]  i'm trying to go through the news i'm actually moving pretty quick here i'm going to get into
[14:21.080 --> 14:25.800]  all of that today i will cover it and then i'm going to cover this little jewel right here
[14:28.120 --> 14:32.760]  people thought that i posted a photograph of her that was not flattering or that paul watson did
[14:32.760 --> 14:38.440]  uh actually uh and you go up to info wars dot com and see your photo this is one of the flattering
[14:38.440 --> 14:44.440]  ones and i'm not going off how she looks but that became the whole discussion now the the days control

[15:12.920 --> 15:20.840]  operating procedure this is what they say in the bbc and the london telegraph and all over
[15:20.840 --> 15:27.160]  the news hundreds of them say take people's children at birth to train them to protect the earth

[15:39.800 --> 15:44.760]  not a hundred percent consensus remember that hoax that there was a hundred percent consensus
[15:44.760 --> 15:50.920]  and and no one could say that men and mankind anthropogenic global warming wasn't the case
[15:50.920 --> 15:57.000]  and then it was an imminent thing that would kill us by 2010 flooded cities al gore said in 2000
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.280]  polar bears can't swim greatest land animal swimmer there is showing cartoons the school

[16:30.120 --> 16:36.120]  i'm not attacking them but i had the guy on the air and i said well what if i won't go live in

[24:03.160 --> 24:12.360]  so
[24:12.360 --> 24:35.120]  Okay, you knew it was coming, the NRA that's normally pretty milk toast, when it comes
[24:35.120 --> 24:39.360]  to defending the Second Amendment, loyal opposition of a sword at the top, they've
[24:39.360 --> 24:42.680]  gotten a little bit better over the last few years, thanks to gun owners of America
[24:42.680 --> 24:48.120]  pointing it out and some big fights on their board, but that's another issue.
[24:48.120 --> 24:52.860]  The NRA, National Rifle Association, came out a few months ago and said their internal
[24:52.860 --> 24:59.320]  analysis and lobbying sources show that Obama and his memos say this as well, his promise
[24:59.320 --> 25:05.880]  to Handgun Policy Center, Violence Policy Center, all those different groups, Handgun
[25:05.880 --> 25:12.880]  Control Incorporated, their analysis shows that he does plan to try to ban semi-autos
[25:12.880 --> 25:21.640]  from manufacture and sale, not just from manufacture.
[25:21.640 --> 25:26.040]  And of course, you know, they're buying up 400 and something million hollow point bullets
[25:26.040 --> 25:34.380]  here, another 300 million other types of rounds there, every federal agency and state agency
[25:34.380 --> 25:38.600]  are arming to the teeth against the public, because it's not our government, it works
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.720]  for the global mafia, the mega banks that have seized the country, does that mean the
[25:43.720 --> 25:49.240]  average person in those bureaucracies is bad, no, just like the average German soldier was
[25:49.240 --> 25:52.760]  not a bad person, but who's on top?
[25:52.760 --> 25:58.500]  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, sworn to destroy this country's sovereignty, all on record
[25:58.500 --> 26:03.600]  shipping narcotics into the country and being above the law, launder in the money, own in
[26:03.600 --> 26:12.160]  the aircraft, Bloomberg, AP, nobody gets in trouble, Wells Fargo, Wachovia, government
[26:12.160 --> 26:17.120]  shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment, in all the federal court rulings,
[26:17.120 --> 26:23.120]  narcotics trafficking, their informants come in all the time and say I was told to bring
[26:23.120 --> 26:28.080]  in these 10 tons, the government comes in and says that's right, please drop the case.
[26:28.080 --> 26:33.160]  Of course it's 500 billion a year in drugs coming in alone, of course the big banks that
[26:33.160 --> 26:38.200]  run the country and run the military and run the FBI are running it, the only people they're
[26:38.200 --> 26:46.200]  allowed to bust are the small potato people, the people that happen to have routes to sneak
[26:46.200 --> 26:53.880]  it in that cuts in on the big mafia's money, that's it, when they bust your kid using illegal
[26:53.880 --> 27:01.280]  drugs they send them to college, prison college, HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis college, when
[27:01.280 --> 27:08.040]  they get out they're covered with tats head to foot, they know how to be a good punk now
[27:08.040 --> 27:12.920]  and a good informant to go lie on good citizens and send them to prison, that's why we have
[27:12.920 --> 27:17.800]  the biggest prison population in the world, we have a mafia that runs America, I'm sorry
[27:17.800 --> 27:29.200]  I'm digressing from our top news here, I told you that it was coming, NRA has warned that
[27:29.200 --> 27:33.560]  Obama does plan this in his second administration, like he told me Ed Yev, he said I can do whatever
[27:33.560 --> 27:39.200]  I want once I'm reelected, it doesn't matter because the guy running against him who's
[27:39.200 --> 27:44.480]  the preeminent Republican or the heir apparent, the media is saying, Mitt Romney's been for
[27:44.480 --> 27:52.360]  victim disarmament and abortion, Obama administration exploits Trayvon Martin shooting to push anti
[27:52.360 --> 28:01.080]  gun race-baiting rhetoric, from Florida to Minnesota, from Wisconsin to Texas, black
[28:01.080 --> 28:05.800]  youths are now mugging and beating up white people and Hispanics and when it's in the
[28:05.800 --> 28:10.760]  news you've got to fight to find out that they're racial attacks, because again the
[28:10.760 --> 28:18.480]  system creates the myth of this wanton white on black crime wave, they create this giant
[28:18.480 --> 28:25.560]  myth that all of this is going on, then people think well it's my right to go to the local
[28:25.560 --> 28:30.600]  fair or go to the local event and beat up anybody who isn't black, and then when it
[28:30.600 --> 28:37.360]  happens it'll be buried in the news that police say that the youth appear to be black and
[28:37.360 --> 28:46.240]  that it's racially motivated, but it's buried, buried in the articles that this is going
[28:46.240 --> 28:52.760]  on, and so why would the system do this, they want us at each other's throats big time,
[28:52.760 --> 28:56.840]  that's what all this is about, and as the depression gets worse and worse the bankers
[28:56.840 --> 29:01.800]  don't want us aware of what they've done, unifying against their federal takeover force
[29:01.800 --> 29:08.920]  of the TSA, unifying against their internet censorship, no, they want domestic unrest,
[29:08.920 --> 29:14.560]  the last time the globalists manipulated this, with the media's help in the late 1960s, major
[29:14.560 --> 29:22.200]  cities burned, mainly black areas destroying their own infrastructure, so the NAACP is
[29:22.200 --> 29:28.800]  begging people not to follow the media's hype on this, and it was used to pass the
[29:28.800 --> 29:33.400]  68 gun control act, when we come back I'm going to break down this article by Paul Joseph
[29:33.400 --> 29:40.440]  Watson's and of course yours truly Alex Jones, we've got huge news on a bunch of other fronts

[31:48.600 --> 32:05.000]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.680]  good sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well known fact
[32:09.680 --> 32:13.880]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[32:13.880 --> 32:19.280]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[32:19.280 --> 32:24.520]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[32:24.520 --> 32:25.520]  healthy.
[32:25.520 --> 32:31.320]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.

[33:53.080 --> 33:57.240]  Here again are some of the headlines at infowarseteam.com right now.
[33:57.240 --> 34:03.440]  Ron Paul says GOP doesn't care about presidents who assassinate American citizens, says that
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.600]  Republicans are in a race to see who can butcher the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[34:07.600 --> 34:08.600]  quicker.
[34:08.600 --> 34:10.640]  He said that on national television.
[34:10.640 --> 34:14.240]  We have that video up there on the site.
[34:14.240 --> 34:22.520]  Also Obama administration exploits Trayvon shootings to push anti-gun race-baiting rhetoric
[34:22.520 --> 34:26.360]  and they're openly saying they may try to now start restricting the Second Amendment.
[34:26.360 --> 34:34.880]  Supreme Court rules strip searches okay for minor offenses, again Supreme Court rules strip
[34:34.880 --> 34:40.920]  searches okay for minor offenses.
[34:40.920 --> 34:46.440]  Continuing Arizona passes sweeping internet censorship bill, massive report, breaking
[34:46.440 --> 34:54.000]  at infowarseteam.com, homeland security targets anti-abortion activist as domestic terrorist,
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.920]  huge report, infowarseteam.com.
[34:56.920 --> 35:01.880]  Another report by Mike Adams, he concurs with my analysis of the Hunger Games, a glimpse
[35:01.880 --> 35:09.400]  of our own future if the cancerous growth of government is not checked.
[35:09.400 --> 35:14.880]  Another report environmental toxins may be causing mass cancer wave and the 15 trillion
[35:14.880 --> 35:18.880]  dollar party article by the economic collapse.
[35:18.880 --> 35:24.160]  All of that and more at infowarseteam.com and prisonplanet.com, we're also going to
[35:24.160 --> 35:30.800]  premiere here on the radio a short report on Edward Bernays and another important report
[35:30.800 --> 35:34.560]  coming up today.
[35:34.560 --> 35:40.400]  So stay with us for that.
[35:40.400 --> 35:49.800]  Barack Obama on record told his cousin Odinga, a politician in Kenya, that he should stage
[35:49.800 --> 35:56.000]  riots back when Obama was a senator in Kenya to dispute an election between Muslims and
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.200]  Christians in that Muslim Christian nation, predominantly Christian, so that they would
[36:02.200 --> 36:03.840]  give him a slot in government.
[36:03.840 --> 36:08.200]  Odinga did that and they created the prime ministership form.
[36:08.200 --> 36:11.680]  The left is not the left, the right is not the right.
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.480]  These are all facsimiles in a controlled debate.
[36:17.480 --> 36:22.520]  But what they've always had planned in this country is playing the population off against
[36:22.520 --> 36:31.480]  each other, divide and conquer.
[36:31.480 --> 36:38.640]  Now Biden has gone on CBS News and we have clips of that and links to that in the article
[36:38.640 --> 36:44.520]  at infowarseteam.com over the weekend and he said previous to that on Friday as well.
[36:44.520 --> 36:50.920]  Now two statements that they have to look at the self-defense right and repeal people
[36:50.920 --> 36:54.320]  having the right to defend themselves, which is repealing common law.
[36:54.320 --> 36:58.960]  In England they arrest you if you defend yourself in your own house even with a butcher knife.
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.920]  They energetically go after you because you've got to be taught to be a total jellyfish because
[37:03.920 --> 37:08.680]  the instincts of the criminal government are to protect their criminal brethren on the ground.
[37:08.680 --> 37:12.360]  But more importantly, never send the message that you could fight back.
[37:12.360 --> 37:16.040]  Never send the message that you could stand up for yourself.
[37:16.040 --> 37:22.760]  You've seen the cases of one of the Beatles, wife, broke a lamp over a guy in the house
[37:22.760 --> 37:27.240]  stabbing him and the police almost arrested him for it or people have stabbed intruders
[37:27.240 --> 37:31.760]  and gone to jail in England or been robbed three times and shoot them with a shotgun
[37:31.760 --> 37:34.960]  and go to jail.
[37:34.960 --> 37:40.040]  So that's what they're pushing now and Obama has got all this civil unrest legislation in
[37:40.040 --> 37:44.160]  place all over the country from New York to Minnesota.
[37:44.160 --> 37:49.720]  They're putting nighttime curfews in in some areas of Arkansas because of gang violence.
[37:49.720 --> 37:54.640]  They've got daytime curfews for adults as well and just set up checkpoints.
[37:54.640 --> 38:00.240]  They've declared a civil emergency. I've played those newscast here and that's what this is
[38:00.240 --> 38:01.240]  all about.
[38:01.240 --> 38:08.600]  I mean every channel of TV hyping race hyping attacks hyping this whether Trayvon was in
[38:08.600 --> 38:12.000]  the right or the wrong or Zimmerman was in the right or the wrong.
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.240]  You got black neighbors that said they saw Trayvon on top of Zimmerman.
[38:17.240 --> 38:21.800]  But the media hardly shows that ABC News has an interview NBC has one.
[38:21.800 --> 38:26.880]  I've seen it one time. The police that's what they say is in the report is that's why they
[38:26.880 --> 38:31.600]  didn't arrest him was that Trayvon was attacking him neighbors say the guys you know nose was
[38:31.600 --> 38:35.600]  bandaged and was bleeding Zimmerman none of that matters okay.
[38:35.600 --> 38:43.080]  The point is the system has seized on this and you've got the White House MSNBC the new
[38:43.080 --> 38:49.240]  black Panther Party Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson all hyping civil unrest and violence and everybody
[38:49.240 --> 38:55.600]  hyped up but you got the NAACP leadership coming out and saying this is divisive this
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.680]  is going to cause problems this is going to cause all sorts of racial divisions.
[39:01.680 --> 39:09.360]  We do not need burning cities and then I get these comments and emails and oh Alex you're
[39:09.360 --> 39:15.320]  just scared we're going to come get you in a race war and burn down your house listen
[39:15.320 --> 39:20.400]  that is so childish and stupid whenever they have these riots it burns down the neighborhoods
[39:20.400 --> 39:25.760]  and the businesses so that afterwards nobody comes in and rebuilds and it destroys the economic
[39:25.760 --> 39:26.760]  viability.
[39:26.760 --> 39:33.240]  You know I'm a pro gun person but where I live in the country there's so much gunfire
[39:33.240 --> 39:39.080]  in the little ranchettes around me that it sounds like World War three.
[39:39.080 --> 39:44.240]  It's annoying to get up at 7am and like somebody's fire you know firing sounds like 500 rounds
[39:44.240 --> 39:50.480]  of ammo and then at noon it's happening just constant firing firing firing firing I will
[39:50.480 --> 39:56.160]  assure you there won't be any rioting out where I live I will assure you nobody's going
[39:56.160 --> 39:58.360]  to come there and racially do anything.
[39:58.360 --> 40:03.440]  Will whites get beat up going to the mall yes they are right now every day the reports
[40:03.440 --> 40:09.400]  are pouring out media never says it's racial until it comes out in court later.
[40:09.400 --> 40:15.720]  Are whites being attacked at the fair you bet old ladies old men especially I guess
[40:15.720 --> 40:23.800]  if they weren't anti-black before they are now.
[40:23.800 --> 40:27.360]  And so they're entering a new phase where it's not going to be whites all bleeding
[40:27.360 --> 40:33.440]  heart and whites all I'm evil tax me a whole bunch take my rights I want to prove I'm not
[40:33.440 --> 40:39.200]  racist and now it's going to segue if the globalists have their way until a true
[40:39.200 --> 40:44.560]  divided country the system doesn't want people at barbecues and football games getting along
[40:44.560 --> 40:48.800]  they want under the name of multiculturalism to have everyone look at them with their shoulder
[40:48.800 --> 40:55.120]  and thinking people don't like them thinking people are out to get them and just like after
[40:55.120 --> 41:01.040]  the burning cities of the late 60s they passed the 68 gun control act federalized stuff that's
[41:01.040 --> 41:08.000]  what they're testing right now they're thinking I mean it's 100% hyping violence hyping race
[41:08.000 --> 41:17.680]  war NBC editing tapes to make Zimmerman sound racist caught all of it just like the lacrosse
[41:17.680 --> 41:26.720]  team they're so desperate to find some anti-white information the control corporate media that
[41:26.720 --> 41:31.480]  they said that the whole lacrosse team oh white men raping a black woman this is pure
[41:31.480 --> 41:41.640]  gold show whenever there's black on white crime the media will not report it but whenever
[41:41.640 --> 41:52.520]  they can find somewhere I mean Zimmerman looks Hispanic but they call him white and then people
[41:52.520 --> 41:56.880]  go but he looks like Hispanic okay he's a white Hispanic because they want to make it
[41:56.880 --> 42:04.840]  white people you see because that's the narrative they want to get a white versus black clash
[42:04.840 --> 42:15.280]  going here I mean Obama top estimates are about 9% African because his dad is part Arab
[42:15.280 --> 42:18.800]  part white and part African if you believe that guy that looks nothing like him's his
[42:18.800 --> 42:24.160]  dad I mean Obama looks like he might be might be 10% African somewhere back there the word
[42:24.160 --> 42:31.440]  is from Wayne Madsen's investigation and stuff is that really he's Caribbean so he's got
[42:31.440 --> 42:36.680]  native background Spanish background black you know the whole nine yards that's exactly
[42:36.680 --> 42:46.400]  what Obama looks like you know handsome good-looking Mediterranean black Hispanic white mix and
[42:46.400 --> 42:54.640]  the point is are we going to call him a white black person Zimmerman is a white Hispanic
[42:54.640 --> 42:58.600]  now of course the first month it was a white guy it's like a white guy did something get
[42:58.600 --> 43:12.400]  a beat him up and I'm tired of it I mean the white people I know are so politically correct
[43:12.400 --> 43:18.720]  that if they're in a business situation I've had these discussions where well they were
[43:18.720 --> 43:25.040]  asking me you know what lady I talked to but but but but the lady I talked to was black
[43:25.040 --> 43:30.680]  am I supposed to say it was the black lady and then politically correct go no you weren't
[43:30.680 --> 43:37.120]  supposed to but if it was a red haired lady you'd say a red haired white lady or a brunette
[43:37.120 --> 43:50.920]  with glasses I was a black guy with a red baseball cap you don't even say I saw comments
[43:50.920 --> 43:56.320]  on it on a huge report we did for the nightly news that then got posted to YouTube with
[43:56.320 --> 44:02.560]  sheriff our Pio and Zulu his top investigator and others on the fake birth certificate our
[44:02.560 --> 44:08.280]  Pio gets up and says at the press conference there's been a blackout on this information
[44:08.280 --> 44:15.160]  and half the discussion was see he's racist blackout is code for black people no a blackout
[44:15.160 --> 44:20.960]  has always meant a blackout like turn the lights out when a bombers come to bomb your
[44:20.960 --> 44:27.640]  city so nobody sees where they can bomb or blacking things out like the FBI blacked out
[44:27.640 --> 44:40.480]  the text of the document that's what a blackout means blacking it out black balled black listed
[44:40.480 --> 44:50.320]  you know if they said you were communist in Hollywood nothing to do with black people
[44:50.320 --> 44:54.080]  and then there's all that well don't call them black people call them call them African
[44:54.080 --> 45:00.080]  Americans and black folks are like no call is black it's like Russell means you know
[45:00.080 --> 45:08.600]  they have American leader I'm like Native American he goes please just call me an Indian I don't
[45:08.600 --> 45:15.080]  like the political correctness again it's this patronizing liberal destruction of language
[45:15.080 --> 45:20.280]  where they control the language and where you and where our Pio can't even say our our
[45:20.280 --> 45:25.360]  findings this birth certificate's fake has been blacked out and he's a racist I mean
[45:25.360 --> 45:32.000]  again that's the segue into you don't believe global warming is happening or that it's man
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.440]  made they're saying all over the news arrest people in fact they're moving to do it in
[45:39.440 --> 45:47.200]  Europe I saw BBC article where they have undercover police in restaurants where if they hear you
[45:47.200 --> 45:54.360]  call someone homosexual if you use the scientific term or say black you are arrested I'm not
[45:54.360 --> 46:00.280]  kidding you can pull that up Robin Page BBC reporter said we deserve the same rights in
[46:00.280 --> 46:10.480]  rural areas as Muslims and homosexuals and they said the word homosexual was hateful
[46:10.480 --> 46:15.360]  and arrested him I had him on and the news was like good he's been arrested he said
[46:15.360 --> 46:23.480]  the word and that's so some weirdo like this professor and all these other professors climate
[46:23.480 --> 46:30.800]  change skepticism a sickness that must be treated says professor global warming alarmist equates
[46:30.800 --> 46:42.560]  climate denial with racism you see nothing to do with race when I criticize Obama for
[46:42.560 --> 46:47.080]  the NDA they say you're not the media comes and says you're not really a racist are you
[46:47.080 --> 46:52.400]  no I don't want to be secretly arrested the system didn't put Obama in there to bring
[46:52.400 --> 46:58.200]  racial unity the system wants divide and conquer that's my point I want everybody no matter
[46:58.200 --> 47:04.680]  what race color creed they are to have a good life and a good future and to to live in harmony
[47:04.680 --> 47:13.200]  and peace and as we go into this depression as the system moves us towards civil unrest
[47:13.200 --> 47:17.040]  that they know is going to happen from this depression they want to shift it into racial
[47:17.040 --> 47:21.400]  conflict so the government can be the referee listen to me carefully because this is the
[47:21.400 --> 47:26.560]  heart of all of it they don't want the civil unrest to be about the government or police
[47:26.560 --> 47:32.880]  brutality or corruption whether it's good or bad and I say it's bad when a cop shoots
[47:32.880 --> 47:38.720]  a black guy in handcuffs in the back and doesn't get in trouble they don't hype that up but
[47:38.720 --> 47:43.920]  when they got a case of a quote white guy where they can pull everybody against each
[47:43.920 --> 47:50.520]  other then the media hypes it it's about getting us all fighting so the system can play referee
[47:50.520 --> 47:58.200]  and then bring in even more political correctness where they sit up there like the gods and say
[47:58.200 --> 48:06.040]  you're a racist you know when I had a history channel here multiple times discovery channel
[48:06.040 --> 48:12.840]  nightline MSNBC it's always the same I'll be talking about 911 being an inside job or
[48:12.840 --> 48:18.000]  government drug dealing they'll look at me and they'll say you're not racist are you
[48:18.000 --> 48:25.960]  and I'm like now I'm supposed to say no I don't beat my wife or no I don't you know
[48:25.960 --> 48:31.040]  kidnap people it's like saying you're not a drug dealer are you and then they say well
[48:31.040 --> 48:35.280]  talking about big banks you're not any Semitic are you and I explained to the last group
[48:35.280 --> 48:40.960]  that was here I said you injecting that is what's backfired now on the system and now
[48:40.960 --> 48:46.400]  everybody is becoming anti Semitic a lot of people are because you do you have any opinion
[48:46.400 --> 48:52.640]  on anything the system uses that because it's a thing to hammer people down it's something
[48:52.640 --> 48:57.720]  that's oh no I'm not that and now it's used against everybody they say that it's anti
[48:57.720 --> 49:05.480]  Semitic to not believe man made global warming actually say it it has nothing to do with
[49:05.480 --> 49:18.520]  reality it's political correctness as a weapon Obama administration exploits Trayvon shooting
[49:18.520 --> 49:25.760]  to push anti-gun race-baiting rhetoric establishments creating the myth of white on black violence
[49:25.760 --> 49:31.120]  to take everyone's rights the Obama administration is supporting and its supporters and the establishment
[49:31.120 --> 49:37.040]  media are engaging in a transparent effort to whip up racial tension over the Trayvon
[49:37.040 --> 49:42.480]  Martin shooting in a bid to chill Second Amendment rights and polarize the American people as
[49:42.480 --> 49:48.200]  part of an election stunt in doing so they're manufacturing a race-baiting myth that threatens
[49:48.200 --> 49:54.260]  to cause genuine racial unrest already happening the evil whites are getting what they deserve
[49:54.260 --> 49:59.960]  so I'm told the notion that white on black hate crimes are a problem of epidemic proportion
[49:59.960 --> 50:05.640]  when in reality federal crime statistics prove the opposite is true despite a witness telling
[50:05.640 --> 50:10.680]  Sanford police that he saw Martin attacking George Zimmerman a black witness before the
[50:10.680 --> 50:15.320]  fatal shot was fired clearly suggesting Zimmerman was acting in self-defense the administration
[50:15.320 --> 50:21.160]  has exploited the tragedy to create momentum for the right to self-defense to be abolished
[50:21.160 --> 50:28.680]  altogether during a CBS News interview which aired yesterday vice president Biden said
[50:28.680 --> 50:34.240]  the incident would reopen debate on the stand your ground self-defense law which also flagrantly
[50:34.240 --> 50:38.520]  lied about the Second Amendment he went on to lie about it and he went on I'm going to
[50:38.520 --> 50:41.720]  come back and tell you about this thing go to your phone calls but the point is this
[50:41.720 --> 50:49.040]  is the reelection bid of Obama this is it and and and media matters and George Soros
[50:49.040 --> 50:53.640]  is divide and conquer get us all fighting with each other and then government will play
[50:53.640 --> 50:58.800]  the part of referee by coming in and taking everybody's liberties and freedoms and restricting
[50:58.800 --> 51:04.000]  the Second Amendment I'd seen the ungevity products work for many others and so I bought
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.120]  a bunch of them started using them had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the
[51:08.120 --> 51:14.280]  regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw
[51:14.280 --> 51:19.160]  those results I said I better follow my own advice started taking the ungevity products
[51:19.160 --> 51:25.680]  and it's been incredible 37 pounds in two months our bodies are amazing and God gave
[51:25.680 --> 51:30.640]  us an incredible gift but if our body doesn't have the tools it needs all of the vitamins

[54:27.760 --> 54:36.800]  remember what the attorney general said he said we've got to have the media brainwash the
[54:36.800 --> 54:43.000]  public against individuals owning firearms and he has said in public letters he believes
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.600]  in the abolition of the individual right to keep their arms which is the declaration of
[54:48.600 --> 54:54.680]  war against our country and our republic for far too long the system has used political
[54:54.680 --> 55:02.440]  correctness to make us all bow down and worship the public criminals that run our lives I mean
[55:02.440 --> 55:06.240]  all the core design memos are public that he gave the order to steal the money nothing's
[55:06.240 --> 55:12.240]  happened to him six months in or five and a half months in if you want to get technical
[55:12.240 --> 55:16.640]  I here's the Chicago Tribune we were reporting on this last week I've got to say we're now
[55:16.640 --> 55:22.280]  driving the news when government comes out with bioethicist groups and says kill babies
[55:22.280 --> 55:28.840]  up to age three we force the mainstream media to cover it we report first we reported first
[55:28.840 --> 55:34.200]  last week that the government threw out the GMO labels they got over a million confirmed
[55:34.200 --> 55:38.800]  signatures the government threw out 70% of them and just said they only received three
[55:38.800 --> 55:50.560]  hundred something thousand to demand GMO labeling on all food again the system is trying to block
[55:50.560 --> 55:58.240]  you at every single front from you being able to make your own decision the government
[55:58.240 --> 56:04.320]  just blocked BPA ban most other countries since we've been exposing in the last decade
[56:04.320 --> 56:11.840]  and others have taken the BPA out causes cancer sterility is deadly just just from our own
[56:11.840 --> 56:17.160]  sewage that gets into lakes and streams it's killing the fish and making them sterile frogs
[56:17.160 --> 56:29.140]  you name it but the FDA food and recommendation doesn't want you to be able to not be exposed
[56:29.140 --> 56:37.560]  to it there's your criminal government you know instead of blacks white Hispanics Asians
[56:37.560 --> 56:42.680]  all looking over each shoulders you know each other and all paranoid because the media teaches
[56:42.680 --> 56:46.480]  us that we all hate each other and but the media is there to be the referee though and
[56:46.480 --> 56:53.360]  make sure we're all good boys and girls how about we say hey we want labeling of what
[56:53.360 --> 56:59.240]  has cross species GMO in it we want to know if plants grow their own pesticide so bugs
[56:59.240 --> 57:04.680]  won't eat it and then you feed it to us that's the main thing causing all this liver failure
[57:04.680 --> 57:12.040]  on record in all the rodent studies we want the BPA out that's actually hurting all of
[57:12.040 --> 57:19.320]  us but see he doesn't hurt you in a humiliating way like a couple white guys beating some
[57:19.320 --> 57:25.360]  poor gay person to death which they make a cause celeb or some poor black guy getting
[57:25.360 --> 57:30.600]  shot whatever the case is but that makes a cause celeb no it's just cancer rates thousands
[57:30.600 --> 57:42.600]  of percentile off the chart a general death a general curse you see we have to set the
[57:42.600 --> 57:47.640]  agenda and more and more we are that's why there's all this internet censorship coming
[57:47.640 --> 57:52.560]  we got big news on that front coming up at a moment extremely unconstitutional out of
[57:52.560 --> 57:59.280]  Arizona I'm going to get into the whole NFL situation but violence policy center handgun
[57:59.280 --> 58:05.040]  control incorporated they've all said they plan to try to completely ban semi-autos in
[58:05.040 --> 58:11.320]  the next administration the NRA has put out a warning saying that they quote do plan to
[58:11.320 --> 58:17.840]  ban types of firearms in the next administration Eric Holder has been caught shipping guns
[58:17.840 --> 58:22.480]  into Mexico to blame the second amendment perjuring himself so we'd be crazy not to
[58:22.480 --> 58:26.360]  know this is coming and now Biden's saying oh yeah we're going to bring up gun control
[58:26.360 --> 58:32.080]  now over Trayvon Martin so now it'll be some racial right now owning guns is going to be

[58:46.320 --> 58:54.120]  radio network hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[58:54.120 --> 58:58.400]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in
[58:58.400 --> 59:02.960]  a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[59:02.960 --> 59:06.800]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[59:06.800 --> 59:11.080]  could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the
[59:11.080 --> 59:16.880]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[59:16.880 --> 59:21.640]  an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[59:21.640 --> 59:25.960]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds
[59:25.960 --> 59:31.720]  to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com that's
[59:31.720 --> 59:43.440]  survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember

[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:36.360]  all right we're into hour number two we got a BBC headline here that I want to go over
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.680]  Boeing tries to defy gravity we're gonna look at some of that coming up Obama administration
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:50.840]  exploits Trayvon shooting to push anti-gun race-baiting rhetoric we've also got curfews
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:56.600]  going on all over the United States because of racial unrest and racial attacks they're
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.560]  going on to get to dig to find that also I'm gonna give you my take at the bottom of the
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:07.200]  hour on the whole Saints bounty program of hurting people I'm gonna tie that in to some
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.880]  other key issues and give you a take I'll assure you haven't heard yet so that's all
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:20.120]  coming up also big attacks on the First Amendment that's all coming up really important Intel
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:26.680]  but right now Jonathan in Kansas than Rick blue Keith William and others Rick you're
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:36.520]  on the air from New York welcome yeah okay we'll go to Jonathan in Kansas then go ahead
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:44.520]  Jonathan yes Alex I agree with you I think that they are trying to cause divide and conquer
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.920]  I think it's better what I would do though is I would argue I would bring up all the
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:56.720]  cases of bigotry through gun control through is what millions of people have died through
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.440]  that but what I wanted to say was this was a distraction and look what I found it's
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:08.560]  to distract us from what other stuff like I found this video on YouTube and it's a
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:15.160]  Pentagon briefing and it's on removing the God gene it came out they was dated April
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:22.440]  13th to 2005 and basically it talks about how vaccines are gonna be used to to go after
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:27.200]  a Islamic fundamentalist and it says that it's gonna attack their frontal lobe and cause
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.320]  them be well basically to be lobotomized well I know that they're coming out with vaccines
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.480]  that they admit will make you behave yourself and they call them vaccines they're really
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:44.640]  nanotech genetic engineering mutation systems like vaccines you don't have a heart attack
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.880]  vaccine so you won't ever want to use drugs because it destroys all of your endorphin
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:56.560]  receiver sites I have not seen this Pentagon briefing is it actual video of it yes it's
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:05.080]  go to YouTube and type in Pentagon briefing on removing the God gene the God gene Pentagon
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:10.560]  briefing on removing the God gene and also I found something but it's it's not related
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:19.560]  to that but it might be related to Breitbart and basically I found that on March 1st the
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:27.840]  US military defense information system agency DISA had a total shutdown of internet access
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:32.760]  and Blackberry service and they didn't give a specified reason and may or may not have
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:39.600]  to do with Breitbart because considering that the Pentagon is the one that tracks down enemies
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:46.200]  and whatnot we have all that legislation oh yeah they probably killed him yeah yeah
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.320]  well there was an internet outage and they basically they gave no specified reason for
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:56.680]  that whole day they had to cut off there was no internet there was no Blackberry and we
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:05.480]  know that they target that targeting everybody who's against Obama and there's you know all
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:12.400]  this legislation of NDAA and all that and you have the targets list and this thing about
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.000]  citizens should be killed if there's a blackout a lot of time if there's a blackout and keep
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.520]  people from knowing from other things getting released down well let me tell you something
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:27.640]  you brought up one of the most important things that I've been harping on for probably more
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:32.760]  than 10 years and that's all the government reports I have seen and I have seen Pentagon
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:38.720]  text talking about giving you a vaccine that attacks key areas of resistance in your in
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.760]  your brain physically attacking areas that well well the God Gene you know that make
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:47.080]  you really care about something and really stand for something they want to make you
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.440]  biological androids but the fact that you're saying you found this video we've now found
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.800]  it is big news thank you so much that's why I love taking calls more calls straight ahead

[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:26.560]  of about a third of the news but I want to go back into some more of what I have already
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.360]  mentioned but also get into a bunch of news I haven't covered yet at the bottom of the
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:40.400]  hour I'm gonna spend about five minutes telling you what I think about the new orleans saints
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:48.960]  scandal where the feds are saying they may start indicting people for racketeering organized
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:56.200]  criminal behavior I've got an article here out of us today tell us what you think are
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:03.680]  you in favor of criminal charges for bounty program hurting people on purpose so we're
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.360]  going to be breaking that down coming up at the bottom of the hour and you're like alex
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:13.080]  I thought football isn't important this is about the mafia that runs our country posing
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:18.960]  like they're the good guys going after people for small fry stuff like this how do you have
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:24.520]  criminals enforce the law that's where I'm going with it like having the UN say they're
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.240]  going to invade countries to bring peace or because environmental crimes are being committed
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.680]  and all these top professors saying arrest people that don't agree with with manmade
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:42.160]  climate change these are authoritarians packaging and all in a sicky sweetness this is real danger
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:50.880]  we're in by the way we had a caller in the last segment Jonathan who said hey alex I
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:56.800]  found a pentagon briefing where they talk about removing the god gene with vaccines
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:05.480]  that actually attack your brain and sure enough it's true department of defense now when
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:11.040]  he said that my brain clicked because I've done the fluoride mercury and things of the
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.760]  general public and I was like wait a minute I've read that before that's the vaccines
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:19.200]  that are going to stop rebellion the vaccines that are going to neutralize us and turn us
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:27.920]  into basically zombies biological sub void servant androids and sure enough during the
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.520]  break I went in there and looked and there it is so we're going to queue that up later
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:37.880]  I mean this is how much trouble we're in it's one thing to have it on paper from them but
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:46.280]  another thing to know this weekend I saw it in the news that oh my gosh some estimates
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:55.200]  are 1 in 56 now have autism in the US 1 in 41 in South Korea what's happening and one
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.520]  thing as well it shows that iPads and things with small children wire their brains differently
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:08.600]  and pesticides and between all a and mercury in the vaccines folks it's all of it I go
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:16.480]  to restaurants and I look and look at people's children and folks these kids look like they've
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:23.400]  been run over and it's going to become so apparent soon when half the people on your
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:30.240]  block have cancer and when your child can't talk at age 4 and when the curses of the eugenics
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:38.600]  slaughter hits you I want to say something here right now and I'm going to your calls
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:44.200]  the FBI will use any excuse to snoop around my office to call my employees to try to get
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:49.440]  people to say stuff about me I can't even go to a gun show without people running up
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:56.640]  saying oh Alex here's my ID but I don't want to use it buy buy me a gun and I'll pay you
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:01.120]  with two ATF guys standing there and it's clearly a setup and I have to like get out
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:08.200]  of the building before they just claim I'm trying to buy a gun I mean this is my life
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:14.640]  and then I realize the people trying to do this to me are literal victims of this their
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:19.240]  children their grandchildren their wives their husbands are going to be affected by this we're
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:26.080]  living in a science fiction movie and I thought about it I've got to control myself and not
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.520]  just be the primitive male I am and I've got to intellectually get my act together and
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:37.280]  just present nothing but scientific reports I've had an epiphany sure I'll continue to
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.840]  have the radio show and do the nightly news and all of this but but but what's really
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:47.520]  powerful is my scientific reports I do where I show all the admissions all the documents
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:55.120]  all the facts and those type of reports reach millions of people and they're incontrovertible
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:01.960]  but I'm going to ask you what are you doing about this my mother was over this weekend
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:06.760]  with my dad visiting with the grandchildren and she's like yeah I saw it on the news like
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:11.480]  some reports are one and eighty something some are one and fifty something and and and
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:16.160]  it's everywhere and they don't know what it is and they don't know what it is we're
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:23.040]  being soft killed they turn up the chemicals the biologicals the radiologicals the the
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.120]  frequency pollution the ambient level gets louder and louder it's like crickets that
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.120]  are first is that a cricket then yeah those are crickets and pretty soon there's a million
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:37.880]  crickets going off in a room till it's deafening everything they do is psychological warfare
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:43.960]  driven they admit it they slowly roll out their surveillance without warrants now they just
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:50.760]  totally admit it we're watching recording everything you're doing they slowly roll out
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.680]  that they want to start aborting children after birth and killing old people and having
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.680]  euthanasia and now they just admit it they slowly say world government's coming and then
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:08.000]  say world government's your only hope and they've hired armies of criminals to be in
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:15.800]  the bureaucracy and law enforcement especially federal and they've hired just vicious hateful
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:23.800]  people who love preying on people and torturing and intimidating evil is loose okay and this
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:33.160]  is just the beginning I mean we got a government that'll hype up an unfortunate shooting and
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:38.200]  try to cause a race war and ship guns into Mexico and get caught blaming the second
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:48.760]  amendment and nobody gets in trouble we've got a government run by mega banks who do
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:54.920]  whatever they want whenever they want however they want all right I'll go to your phone
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:02.040]  calls it's just the magnitude of this information and how right we've been and then during the
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:07.460]  break I'm in there watching a Pentagon briefing where they admit we're gonna inject the Muslims
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:17.680]  with with with a vaccine that makes them submit it's a chemical lobotomy we've gotten it the
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:23.280]  young people now you wonder why they can't get upset if they have they have done test
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:30.520]  with monkeys and apes on giving them chemical cocktails in into the bloodstream and then
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:36.240]  testing flicker rates on televisions to sync you up with it where you are a programmable
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:42.400]  biological android a replicant I'm living in Blade Runner here and that's why a lot
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:48.480]  of the public can't focus they you can't get through to them they don't have that urgency
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.880]  they don't have that fighting spirit they're gone a lot of the public's gone folks they're
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:16:04.080]  gone they're gone like a cousin you know who gets run over by a car and is brain damaged
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.480]  or like a grandparent who you visited your whole life and you go see them they don't
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:18.880]  know who you are they're gone public's gone and even if we try to not eat GMO and try

[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.680]  the last two years so it forced media to cover it and all over the country news channels
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.480]  go and stick a geiger counter up to the local water district and it shows you know 50 60
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.800]  70 80 times the radiation level and they go oh we don't and then and then the police

[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:39.440]  had nightmares about this for a decade since I learned of it from government documents
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:45.720]  that are public of a time when they're going to release a communicable virus that attacks
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:52.400]  the key lobes of the brain the the frontal cerebral cortex so that you can't have emotion
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:59.200]  anymore and it attacks another side lobe that is associated with the spiritual experiences
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.400]  they call it the god gene I just during the last two segments watch the pentagon briefing
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:09.720]  confirmed it's put out by the pentagon with pentagon code I separately had read this in
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:17.760]  MIT reports but I see the military brass in the meeting talking about injecting the troops
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:26.520]  with a lobotomizer I feel like I should stop the show and go run screaming down the street
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:32.140]  saying they're here they're here body snatchers I mean this is that big but it's our own species
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:38.440]  and it's men in suits and military officers at a pentagon briefing sitting there put it
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:49.080]  up on screen for folks guys it's DOD ID 149 AZ to these are brain scans of troops troops
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.720]  that are quote get back from combat oh my gosh I remember wired magazine saying they
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.920]  give them amnesiac drugs when they get back from combat so they don't remember what they
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:04.000]  did or when they serve for five tours now when they burn them out with this they give
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:13.920]  them a lobotomy shot and they go on to admit it's a lobotomy shot whoa whoa and again it's
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:20.040]  how they hide this high treason in plain view they hide this where oh yeah we're gonna kill
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:24.480]  babies up to age three yeah we're shooting the troops up with this vaccine that lobotomizes
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.520]  for their own good and the whole crew is in there with their mouths hanging open when
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:35.960]  I made the video brain eating vaccines and it only got like 300 to something thousand
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:41.200]  views guys will you put up my brain eating vaccine video that's on YouTube yeah there's
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:52.920]  the right middle frontal gyrus after they've been given the vaccine hmm they just knock
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:27:01.200]  out that brain activity wow these are projects in 2005 with our troops you have a religious
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:07.560]  brain that's a you have the non-religious brain you see the key thinking centers are
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:11.720]  right there on that right frontal lobe and when they give you a lobotomy that's what
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.520]  they hit wow oh my god nothing and no one even cares I'll probably be arrested because
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:24.960]  I'm not for lobotomizing everyone I mean it's just it's beyond me what's going on here
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.120]  and they're all within this going we're gonna give your child a vaccine at school so they
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:35.680]  never want cigarettes or alcohol what do you think cigarettes and alcohol mimic they hit
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:42.520]  normal endorphin center receptor sites it's a lobotomy and they admit they've had these
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:49.400]  vaccines where there are viruses that go in that's what this is a live virus eats parts
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:55.480]  of your brain and then I make a video about it showing everybody the documents and it's
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:03.480]  funny that video should have 100 million views not 300 to something thousand and then I watched
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.520]  a bunch of people that were looking at my video laughing at me you know I know I said I get
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:15.920]  back to Rick and blue and Keith and William everybody but yes all over the country they're

[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:47.240]  and they admit in this video they're already giving troops this they go we're gonna give
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.320]  it to the Muslims so they can't fight us and the troops when they come home when they're

[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.120]  mean I cannot just report on this like it's no big deal and then all that does is acclimate

[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:07.560]  do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:12.480]  and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.640]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:22.240]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:28.120]  rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then searched out the best vitamin

[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:05.120]  complex dietary supplement that's info wars team dot com crashing through the lies and
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:13.280]  disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network here's what I'm going to do
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:17.400]  I'm going to take this bunch of phone calls that are holding I'm going to try to calm
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:23.920]  myself a little bit and then I'm going to get to this pentagon briefing this is the
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:29.760]  part that's not classified we have discovered documents online from the pentagon that most
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:36.200]  of it is blacked out that it is a pentagon research project to have a virus go in and
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:42.720]  destroy areas of the brain associated with well the god jean show that you can't have
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:46.920]  muslim fanatics or christian fanatics because they don't believe in god anymore you don't
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:53.320]  have the higher emotions those are the things associated with resisting it's also the things
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:58.840]  associated with troops that are traumatized with ptsd so you just give them a lobotomy
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:04.120]  now when I watch this video it blew me away because everything in it I'd seen in bbc ap
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:12.200]  reuters mit but separate pieces so I know what the guy's saying is real I know this
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:23.040]  is a real pentagon briefing it just totally blows me away that stuff like this is going
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:30.880]  on in plain view and then there's the marshal program headline because they had futures
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.360]  of the pentagons named marshal but that's the headline in wired magazine like eight
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:39.400]  years ago about in the future it won't be what weapons are troops have but what drugs
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.520]  they're on and they go into it there and that they've been testing this on the troops I
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:48.280]  mean they never had the troops serve more than two tours some are doing eight nine
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:57.800]  tours this is destroying them and then the answer is give them a lobotomy and then it
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:06.360]  turns out the scientist of the gentleman that gave this presentation to the pentagon it
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:12.680]  turns out that joey lombardi the man that is in this night 2005 video at the pentagon
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:22.760]  it turns out he did interviews about it and said that said that he wasn't supposed to
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:27.200]  talk about as much of it as he did and so they did it as a form of whistleblowing and
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:36.640]  then he was arrested in south america last year so see a caller calls in with something
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:42.960]  like this I raced down this rabbit trail and then when I hit the information it just totally
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:49.720]  blows me away this isn't like going into a basement and finding a hundred dead bodies
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:55.920]  that's bad this is knowing you're living in a giant test tube with a bunch of crazy people
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:00.760]  playing god and I am angry about it and we could turn this around anytime people would
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:06.920]  wake up to it but it's just so beyond when anybody can even deal with I don't even know
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:13.880]  what we do let's go back to rick in New York Rick you were bringing up how you were a hole
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:17.880]  last week and didn't get on air and the caller was talking about and I did confirm with that
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:23.000]  caller is from a wealthy texas family he's published a book about it and and talk about
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.080]  the big banks stealing his grandmother's money out of her investments that's standard procedure
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:35.200]  standard stockbrokers are there to rob their clients there are some moral ones out there
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:41.280]  kind of like there are some rattlesnakes that won't bite you if you play with them you know
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:45.400]  there's some scorpions that won't sting you but generally they will so it's the exception
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:51.320]  not the rule it's just this system is run by predators for predators and our own naivete
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:56.920]  is what empowers it but tell us in a nutshell what you discovered in New York what we discovered
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:02.320]  in New York was that certain judges were lying on their financial forms and their ethics forms
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:09.000]  and their board of elections forms now this can be applied to every state every small town
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  every village in the united states to find out if honorable citizens assets are being
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:23.600]  stolen and laundered out of their towns and villages and what they have to do is do uh
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:32.880]  if you have a judge or a clerk who's sworn a note to uh uh portrayed correctly their
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:39.520]  assets of what they own and they're not doing it that's it that's what this guy has discovered
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.960]  that's what we have discovered and how the american people can fight back is if you have
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:50.840]  a a judge or a clerk that seems not to be following the constitution all you have to
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:56.600]  do is get his financial forms and his ethics forms and his board of elections forms and
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:02.440]  what we found in New York are top judges in the state of New York lying on their financial
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.320]  forms your ethics forms and their board of elections of course they're all coming almost
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.320]  all of them are total criminals anywhere you have all this gun control means you have criminals
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:18.960]  criminals don't want their prey armed you think a tiger wants a deer it's hunting in
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:27.360]  the forest of india to have an ak-47 what i understand what we can do is drive these
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:33.800]  judges out of the system by the citizens getting exactly but that's what the tyranny is all
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:40.960]  about is they know we're waking up they're racing to tie us down what we can do is fight
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.800]  back by getting your financial forms and ethics forms and matching them with their real property
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:53.520]  holdings okay that's their achilles heel we can drive these corrupt judges out who are
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:59.920]  controlling the police departments to use the police departments against us we can choke
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:05.160]  off one of their major funding systems yeah the public only knew people think the government
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:09.600]  shipping guns into mexico to blame the second amendment are shipping drugs into the country
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.480]  that's nothing they're involved in every racket and they've got little special counties in
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:19.880]  every sector that engage in criminal activity with them like williamson county north of me
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:25.160]  is one of the most evil counties in the world not just the u.s. just a center of pure evil
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:30.160]  with people posing as conservatives just like serial killers will wear a suit and tie i mean
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:35.360]  just i won't even enter williamson county just a den of pure wickedness and but the public's
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.360]  going to find out i just everybody's going to find out drink your uranium your fluoride
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:46.240]  eat your gmo take your shots die of cancer is just all of it pure judgment i appreciate
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.320]  your call and we're living in total psycho world and the only way it's happening is
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:57.720]  good people are naive sitting right next to the pure evil let's go ahead and talk to
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:04.200]  blue in tennessee you're on the air blue thank you alex first i want to throw up an idea
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:12.400]  and then i have a comment at the end on the job is in our main case the idea is when you
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:18.480]  have lemons make lemonade and we can use this movie to hunting games as a way to expose
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:25.120]  agenda 21 to middle school students as well as high schools because once you explain what
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:31.720]  this agenda 21 is to them they can actually see it no i agree look the system thinks a
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:36.600]  movie like hunger games is just going to condition us to our future when we explain the hunger
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:43.120]  games is agenda 21 it's a great way to wake people up i totally agree yeah i think it's
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.800]  there i'm not clever enough to do a website but if someone could do a website that says
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:54.200]  the story behind or the secret behind the hunger game that's when you catch the kids
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:57.640]  attention that's going to say oh i want to see what the secret is and then that's where
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:04.240]  we lay out the case of agenda 21 in terms that they're going to understand and let them know
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:07.880]  that there is a great possibility with them their lost time that this could happen to
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:14.480]  their own children i hear you god bless you instead of dying in some jungle or woods fight
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.440]  like in the movie they send you over to fight foreign enemies over opium and then give you
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:26.960]  a shot that basically lobotomizes your emotions before you come back this is what this is what
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:32.120]  they're discussing yeah i would love to have a contest about people putting up posters
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:37.000]  and banners and yard signs around the movie theaters talking about this and if someone
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.160]  could do this website yeah yeah well it's it's you know we shot a video of that same
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:46.840]  name the the secret of the hunger games revealed and we shot another video over the similar
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:50.720]  headline they've had about a hundred thousand views and people say why are you covering
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:56.160]  the hunger games because by exposing the fact that that's what agenda 21 actually says they
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:01.480]  want to establish complete with gladiatorial events between the different 10 sectors not
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:08.240]  12 when people go find out hey this movie is based on real stuff then that gives them
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:12.320]  an idea of where these environmentalists want to go these are not environmentalist i appreciate
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:20.120]  your points blue keith in florida you're on the air welcome hello alex i was calling
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:26.840]  up about the article you all did a couple weeks ago under the citizens corpse yes i participated
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:33.600]  in a community emergency response training program for like six weeks they have it once
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:40.520]  a week and they are the local fire department and it's in every county in the country under
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:46.800]  homeland security they fund training that's held in churches and community centers and
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.360]  then what raised the red flag is the guys that i went with i said you know what i bet
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:57.560]  you at the end of this they're going to bring in some guy that's a higher up and he's going
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:02.640]  to talk to us about watching terrace and then the move out of the obama deception where
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.760]  you show where the cop that's coming up to the lady that's taking pictures of the damn
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:14.720]  he described that to the team and i said this is all a setup well what they do is that they
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:19.720]  provoke people and they have even old ladies like want to be involved and basically their
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:25.440]  community creating a bunch of spies and they want everybody to spy on one another and
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:31.480]  then they start having these events where they get together and they have like blood drills
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:37.560]  and search and rescue drills and terrorist training drills and they have them at least
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:42.520]  once a month and it gets people everybody gets real hyped up and some of these people
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:46.240]  they get real serious and i had to back off because i realized what they were doing and
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:51.040]  i tried to let me stop you i wish you could shoot video of that because i knew that the
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:59.000]  fema core was covertly quietly set up not secretly but quietly set up in 2002 as part
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  of a division of americorps called secure core and so when obama announced two weeks
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.520]  ago that fema officially runs it it's going to be called fema core i already knew because
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.840]  i'd seen some of these volunteers at events but yes they get the boy scouts involved literally
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:21.000]  going in their house and reporting back to the military what guns they own i mean there's
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.840]  different variants and people thought i was joking about this years ago now it's openly
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:30.800]  happening you're saying you went and volunteered for this tell us where it was what happened
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:37.320]  what the spying was like okay what what they do is they'll even have training drills at
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:42.840]  military installation and you go in and they'll set up a scenario where you have to act like
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:47.640]  you're injured or you know they'll give you different role playing in some cases you actually
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:53.120]  have act like you are a terrorist and i was about to say it always starts with we're helping
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:57.760]  people with hurricanes but next it moves into we're fighting al-qaeda the next week marijuana
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:03.360]  growers and then finally christian conservative gun owners it moves on to their real enemy
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:08.640]  right and they are they have you and they're they're constantly telling you you don't know
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:14.960]  who a terrorist might be exactly and you have to watch everybody around you and then they
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:19.600]  have different individuals they're like hey you do a really good job we want you to start
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:23.800]  leading the program and then people you can start seeing this they're they're feeling
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:28.760]  powered they feel like they're they're a part of the system and then it's almost sick me
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:34.200]  because you realize that i went in i was wide awake it was like i had the glasses on i i
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:39.480]  i mean i could see what was going on and and i could see it was like i think you said the
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:44.000]  red pill or blue pill it was like i saw what was going on and i tried to tell my friends
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.400]  and of course they started calling me tin foil and all that and i was like you know what
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:53.960]  how did i know what they were going to do before they did it explain that to me and then everybody
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:59.600]  gets real quiet but see your friends don't care because it's the power of having a fed
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.720]  act like they like them and of course they want you to be the cannon fodder when they
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:09.760]  start a hit larry and style takeover of america that's what i'm telling you folks they they
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:15.120]  have been training to wage war against us during this banker takeover for decades what
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:23.760]  made you keith get involved what's your county tell folks how you got signed up for it because
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.320]  i think i ought to go get signed up for this or we ought to send some of the crew over
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:31.260]  there to get signed up because this is what goes on i mean i've actually caught some
[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:39.160]  video of this but so we're told it's for hurricanes everything's fine but give us the tales okay
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:46.720]  so what you do is there is called citizens corp corp dot gov and it's a underserved
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:52.280]  community emergency response team and you go there and they have forms and all you can
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:59.280]  contact your local fire department and because fema has a representative under homeland security
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:04.720]  in every county in the country which which which again is federalizing everything locally
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:09.220]  with the money the training and what you're saying is absolutely accurate and then the
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:13.400]  cover is i've seen this in rural areas come on in to learn how to fight al-qaeda you get
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:19.120]  there free coffee donuts they show you a 10 minute al-qaeda video and they turn and say
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:23.480]  now we're gonna start dealing with domestic terrorist gun owners right and it totally
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:29.680]  flips this is the enemy these are the foreign invaders these are the terrorist this is this
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:35.000]  is actually happening okay so so continue so they get you in there and they they get
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.120]  you in there and then basically you're talking about what uh dip first aid safety emergency
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:46.960]  response and then how to be like let's say for instance if a tornado comes in they teach
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:52.840]  you how to you're the community leader you get the special best uh green vest uh with
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:59.840]  third on it and a green uh hard hat and then uh if the police come they talk to you because
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:05.000]  they see you with the vest on but what they do is they have other people within your zip
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.680]  code that are within like a five mile radius that that's a contact person you you all share
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:17.120]  each other's number and then if you see things then you share it with them and uh etc so they
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.120]  use the tornado as the cover which sounds reasonable that should be locally organized
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.320]  not federally they get rid of the old civil defense then they say you're in a community
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:30.560]  and then next they move in to their real target tell me about that right well what they do
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.560]  is then you next thing you know that you're sitting you get these emails or notifications
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:41.360]  hey we're having a training drill that's going to be at the uh local uh uh military base
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.160]  and we're having it there so that that way we can have a controlled environment and uh
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:51.560]  and then uh they do like a mock setup like if somebody there's a mysterious bag that
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:59.200]  was found or in the and they do indicate in the case of civil unrest of course like that
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:03.320]  and so you're going to let us know who the troublemaker are and bring them back to the
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:12.880]  base literally I mean you know and that's so true and the friend that I know that actually
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:18.720]  went that way they recruit you is they go to your church they go to uh large corporations
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:23.840]  they definitely come in and then everybody gets a female hey you can help your community
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:29.800]  and become a community emergency response team member and we are meeting at this location
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:34.440]  and and let me tell you this little mind trick that they throw in so federal policy go ahead
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:39.960]  they they throw in these little bags okay then what when they bring you all together at like
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:46.520]  a local uh emergency training drill and you get your bag well they give some people crappy
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:51.160]  bags and then they give some people good bags and then other people they'll say things like
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:55.880]  well we might we got to try harder so that that way we get better bags it's like it's
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:01.240]  like seeing uh it's pathetic you see people feeding off of something that I was about
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.640]  to say it's not reasonable hey let's get ready for tornadoes everybody works together you
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:11.680]  can see it's all a mind game it's like FBI looking for informants but not an informant
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:18.120]  of real crime they want to find the weak minded people they can use who will lie and send
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:22.560]  people to the gulags that's because they hired Marcus Wolfe the former head of the Stasi
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:27.600]  on record paid him a million dollars a year to train and set all this up this is how the
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:33.880]  east germans did it and the I mean this is hell on earth it's so beyond anything anybody
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:39.040]  could imagine I've been to the urban drills where they train to line citizens up and shoot
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:45.200]  us I have it on video the Marines train to come into our cities have our kids spy on
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:50.800]  us and then line us up and shoot us that's who runs America now one of the military
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.400]  is waking up so fast anything else you want to add anything else you need to add to the
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:59.440]  story sir well I just want to say stay there stay there no no no I want to hear more and
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:05.400]  then more calls coming up a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:09.360]  even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:14.000]  to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.560]  States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost

[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:26.400]  crazy of course if they go look it up they'll find out there are hundreds of quote vaccines
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:31.440]  that are really live virus lobotomy weapons that eat different parts of the brain that's
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:38.480]  coming up next hour and this is being deployed against us just like sv 40 that's caused hundreds
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:44.040]  of millions of cancers our own government admits i've done news reports on this in the
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:48.840]  u.s. that was given to us through the polio vaccine you're like well i don't take that
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:58.960]  now it's viral it's communicable i mean do you understand folks that pediatric cancers
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:04.920]  cancers of children depending on what type you look at but they're all up massively some
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:14.200]  over 10 000 percent in fact i was looking this weekend it was even higher than that that's
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:19.480]  why i'm not worried about being arrested or set up or killed i'm dead already you understand
[01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:26.200]  well you watch pentagon briefings about viruses that are going to lobotomize the troops and
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:33.120]  then you have evidence they're already doing it testing it on them there's just no going
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:40.360]  back at that there's no going back for me anymore i'm living in a science fiction movie
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:45.120]  and that the average person just cares about mega millions and the nfl and here's this
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:56.240]  and is like oh that guy's saying i give the troops shots we're a lot of trouble a lot
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:00.600]  of trouble see the globalists are trying to manage how to get us all brain damage so
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:06.840]  they can then release mega plagues that kill almost everybody they go underground reemerge
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:12.080]  they've got the seed vaults the dna vaults i cover it my film in game i cover in the
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:18.360]  new video we shot eight minutes long the secrets of prometheus film leaked and i use something
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:25.120]  popular in culture like that to then get people to look at what's really happening i going
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:28.760]  back to the gentleman yeah i mean you can find newscast of what he's talking about where
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:36.040]  they show you pieces of it and again these events they get members of the community
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:40.000]  to go to it who think they're going to fight terrorists then you find out it's spying on
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:46.120]  your neighbor but they don't care about that they're finding the types that will do it
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:51.880]  my dad was approached then he learned other dentists all over austin were all approached
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:59.880]  by homeland security to spy on their their patients and violate their hypocritical they
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:06.160]  don't give those anymore doctor patient privilege attorney client privilege it's all being overthrown

[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:28.040]  want to say something else i was just going to say that um they also they uh they give
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:32.280]  you like a special badge and it makes you look feel like real official it's not like
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:37.600]  a law enforcement badge but it's like a corporate type of badge that reflects in uh with uh
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:42.120]  light on it it uh has your name and and i always thought it's funny that there's a number
[01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:47.720]  on it why is there a number on it but um they give you that you put that on uh on your vest
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:54.000]  that you have uh your special vest that you get and then um they constantly are hoping
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.240]  that you know you got to be on on the lookout for terrorists and things of that nature but

[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:21.920]  awakened me um i just want to talk about two organizations that i was involved with their
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:26.560]  illuminatic organizations i want to hear what you think about them um the first one was the
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:32.000]  jovo witness organization my parents had me and them from about five to seventeen total
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.960]  hunger game breeding ground for control they want to control you they don't want you to
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.640]  celebrate holidays they just want you to go to their organization do what they say if you
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:44.000]  don't do what they say you're kicked out you can't talk to your family members you can't talk to
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.040]  anybody so that's my first organization i was highly involved in second one is another one
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:53.840]  called the union league which are all over the country um they have them in philadelphia they
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:57.520]  have them in chicago they have them one here in florida where i live now i was in part of the
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:03.120]  florida i mean i'm sorry the philadelphia chapter i worked for them um i was a banquet server
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:10.320]  i seen oh i could tell you things i seen an illuminatic uh uh ceremonies i seen it um
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:14.960]  things of of that nature that went on in this club which were basically for like bankers and
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:21.120]  political people that ran the city of philadelphia so it's so enlightening me i want to know if
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:28.720]  you know anything about those two organizations and what you think well on the first one i don't
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:36.960]  generally like any big organized group and basically anything of any size generally gets
[02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:47.280]  gets taken over uh but on the joseph uh witness you know type groups what happens is they point
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:52.960]  out a lot of real stuff that's going on in the world and then they themselves from what i've seen
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:59.200]  and heard i don't want to pass judgment on people you know then create something kind of cult like
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:02.720]  because you're only supposed to stay within that group because you're the chosen group and the end
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.440]  of the world's coming all i know is is it's our job to go out and warn everybody and do whatever
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:14.480]  we can now as for all these different uh subgroups within cities and regions you probably saw masonic
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:20.800]  type rituals and that's all part of just kind of the camp followers of what of whatever local
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:25.600]  establishment they've gotten placed in your area so i don't know enough about the union league
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:33.360]  i'd be able to comment on that as well all i know is that they put fluoride in the water
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:39.760]  to dumb us down they want us to take vaccines to dumb us down and i have the documents they
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:44.960]  want us to take vaccines to reduce our fertility they want us to drink out of this thing all later
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:51.760]  we're under chemical attack the public is drunk on chemicals and biologicals kids are misbehaving
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:56.720]  because of the chemicals and biologicals and radiologicals uh and i'm glad that you're quote
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:04.000]  awake now but that's always a process for all of us and uh so i just say more power to you my
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:09.600]  friend please continue to educate yourself and to reach out to others i just want to say one more
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.240]  thing before i wind up regarding the trouble witnesses and their chosen group as you said
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:17.920]  i just want to let you know their new world that they call it they call it the new world
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:22.640]  or the new system is what their people are going to be going to that's the exact names that they use

[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:35.920]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are back live thank you so much for joining us here today more
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:40.800]  of your calls and a ton of news coming up later here in this third hour today
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:48.400]  but let me first get to a subject of the psychological warfare grid we're in
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:54.560]  and that everything you see on the nightly news most of what you see in films in text
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:09:02.400]  is meant to influence you to brainwash you and the globalists think you're stupid they write
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:09.280]  books on it ebra bernays 80 years ago roth cop head of the kissinger group just a few years ago
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:16.640]  admitting all of it but those are publications for the intelligentsia and most people who get
[02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:23.360]  into the intelligentsia don't feel sorry for the general public they get off on the fact that they
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:29.120]  know how things really work and that the general public doesn't and they use it as an advantage
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:39.360]  against everyone else they see it as winning as charlie sheen would say winning to bring back uh
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:49.360]  that anachronism so we have all of these different systems being deployed and used against us
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:56.080]  and in the last decade or so i became aware of a new generation of vaccines they're not
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:01.520]  really vaccines they just call them that because they know you're acclimated to vaccines they are
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:09.280]  genetically engineered viruses that are really nanotech or in some cases they are bacteria
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:15.840]  carrying viruses and they use the bacteria to then replicate to deploy the viruses
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:22.320]  to ensure that the viruses take and they're designed to eat certain brain tissues
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:29.680]  just like they announced they're coming out with a live virus that changes your heart and arteries
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:35.040]  to quote cure heart attacks or or viruses of course they don't say viruses till you actually
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:41.840]  read the the research it'll say vaccine to cure smoking drinking and heroin use because it goes
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:49.360]  in and attacks the normal receptors you have for those drugs those drugs are mimicking things
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:55.520]  that naturally are occurring in your brain so it is a lobotomy of sorts
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:03.360]  and the pentagon admits they're testing drugs vaccines brain manipulating systems in wired
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:08.240]  magazines seven eight years ago it's all over the place and they're deploying this
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:16.000]  and the evidence is they're releasing mosquitoes in africa in florida in the us that make you
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:23.600]  you know take your vaccines they're they're coming out with potatoes and with beets and with
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:30.880]  bananas that have vaccines growing in them it's called pharmacological crops and the public's
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:35.520]  so eager and every time i mention this i get you know see comments or emails oh alex there's no such
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:40.800]  thing they won't type in pharmacological crop and find out it's real so you're living in buck
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:48.480]  rogersville but it's run by eugenicists that want to reduce your population and they're so arrogant
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:54.640]  they just sit back and see this all is a huge experiment the un's been caught giving people
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:12:01.120]  live polio shots live hiv shots they've been caught sterilizing people giving them sterile shots
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:07.280]  in the tetanus all of it on record and in the yuppies say well there are too many people really
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:11.760]  really are you going to actually go there and make that woman have a miscarriage are you going to
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:15.680]  kill that three-year-old baby you're saying kill after birth as they're now promoting are you going
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:23.200]  to cut grandma off her health care and here's something else i know you get on a power trip
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:29.120]  imagining yourself as a controller you are being fed the fluoride water and the radio
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:34.000]  activates the tub water that's put in your city water supply on record you are being given the
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:40.720]  deadly vaccines you're being given the gmo the chemtrails are spraying you with barium salts
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:49.680]  aluminum dioxide thorium and other things i mean if you're a new listener i i harped on this
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:56.320]  for six months two years ago and finally saw articles in texas illinois oklahoma florida new
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:03.920]  york michigan and i actually a few times contacted them and said yeah i know we got calls about you
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:09.920]  saying that they're adding radioactive isotopes but the city says that that's classified for
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:16.080]  homeland security what is exactly in the fluoride they're buying we did test the pipes and they are
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:24.960]  120 times or 60 times it varied city to city higher radiation and there is radiation in the pipes
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:32.160]  just like you said but we're doing a report on why is it radioactive and then the city says we
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:36.000]  don't know and everyone acts like they're dumb because if you admit the government's putting
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:43.200]  radiation radioactive isotopes in your water the whole system is going to come down and you know
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:49.600]  what it needs to come down this whole alien eugenics system they put on top of our republic
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:57.360]  a hundred years ago is pure death we're the fattest we're the dumbest we're the sickest with cancer
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:02.320]  and diabetes and neurological disorders and the charts are going straight up and europe's right
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:09.680]  behind us japan's right behind us they're killing us i go to the mall now and about a third of the
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:14.560]  kids that walk by me look like they've been beaten upside the head with the baseball bat i mean you
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:20.480]  know sick kids with neurological disorders that's why my wife wants to go out to eat and stuff and i
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:27.040]  just can't do it anymore i mean i can't do it anymore i can't go out in public anymore and see
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:31.440]  the kids dying all around me the people with cancer everywhere the people with
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:40.480]  and it's all funny to the government it's all these thugs and want to be tough guys make me sick
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:46.960]  and it's just going to get it's going to get crazier and crazier till nobody can deny it anymore
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:50.720]  and then the system's going to say we got cures for everything that's wrong with you
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:56.160]  and and so the people are going to be slaves to the system that are in the upper echelon
[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:00.720]  just to be able to survive the weapon attacks they're already under
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:06.800]  i mean here is the attorney general saying he had meetings with the media on how to put out
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:12.400]  anti-gun messages to brainwash the public here it is i've also asked the school board
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:19.920]  to make a part of every day some kind of anti-violence anti-gun message every day every school at
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:24.560]  every level one thing that i think is clear with young people and with adults as well
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:29.360]  is that we just have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:34.000]  on a monday and then only do it every monday we need to do this every day of the week and
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:39.040]  just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way that's enough we
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:43.200]  also want to have he goes on to say i've tattletell squads when the carpet cleaners at your house and
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:48.720]  sees a gun case call the police on you even though the gun's legal create the perception that guns
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:55.360]  are illegal notice he said anti-violence anti-gun psychological warfare equate guns with violence
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:01.280]  always blame the gun for what a crazy person does not the fact that on average 15 times
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:06.320]  more often or some case is 20 something but let's be conservative do people use guns against
[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:13.840]  the commission of a crime these are all psychological warfare groups they see you as a
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:21.280]  computer that they're programming they see you as a joke they're going to use you i know a lot of
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:27.120]  you are laughing but when you child gets diagnosed with cancer i try to stop it when you get diagnosed
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.680]  with it very young and and you won't believe it then when they finally tell you that you're in
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:36.400]  operable you're going to die i want you at least to admit we were right and try to warn some people
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:46.960]  before you die that's all i want now this next little clip is was released by researcher that's
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:51.440]  not the scientist that's in the video joey lombardi and we've checked it is a pentagon
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:58.720]  briefing that went on dealing with the program because separately when i watched this i knew
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:02.320]  it was real and they showed it to me when a caller mentioned it because i'd seen it in wired magazine
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:08.080]  and i'd seen it in bbc but like oh you won't be depressed anymore guys search vaccine to cure
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:13.760]  depression and it said it hits the same area of the brain associated with spirituality but but once
[02:17:13.760 --> 02:17:18.320]  you don't have all these strong emotions once you're not in tune to things once you're not feeling
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:23.280]  you'll be a good android see first the globalists tell us we don't have a spirit and then we don't
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:28.000]  have free will now they want to erase what has the free will or at least what our spirit is
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:35.680]  interfacing with in the cerebral cortex and so they say troops coming home that are depressed
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:43.120]  will give them this and i can show you associated press roiders daily mail new vaccine to cure
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:49.120]  depression new vaccine to cure drug abuse hits the same area of the brain and people that have
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:56.640]  taken these in trials are just like oh yes i like that that's very nice they just their biological
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:01.520]  androids hey go over there and move those rocks okay i will sound like a lobotomy where you can't
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:07.600]  talk it's just you don't have that essence anymore the fluoride targets the pineal gland i'm gonna
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:13.680]  come back and play this clip then i'm gonna play a clip from a film i did two years ago a special
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:19.360]  piece called brain eating vaccines everybody's like ah you know it's funny there is new treatment
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:25.280]  for depression vaccines people have severe depression and don't respond to medication
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:32.000]  or psychiatric therapy have only one choice electroshock therapy but now there's a new option
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.960]  for these people that offers some of the same benefits always electroshock running blue lightning
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:47.760]  over your frontal lobes but with none of the pitfalls oh and it goes on to say that they use
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:52.720]  is that a vaccine article because i don't see it in the article they're not saying what the
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:19:03.200]  treatment is the headline is vaccine new vaccine to cure depression that's it boom and and and that
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:08.160]  was some other type of treatment i'm going to look it up and see what that was i'll find it during

[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:23.360]  all i know is i've done the research it's real and then some people think i'm fear
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:29.280]  mongering folks it's so much crazier than i can tell you it's so much further along

[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:38.000]  that headline if they want to be able to go and find that article for themselves there's a whole
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:45.120]  bunch of these and our big article breaks it all down this is from 2010 braiding vaccines the reality
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:50.720]  behind the conspiracy theory wired magazine hit piece attempts to debunk legitimate concerns
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:55.920]  about agenda to chemically lobotomize general public through vaccines water supply and all
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:01.760]  i was doing was linking to department of defense daily mail and other reports where they said
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:08.160]  they're going to cure racism by giving us vaccines that eat the part of the brain that can recognize
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:14.000]  cultural or racial differences uh in fact i forgot that part in fact that was in the news last week
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:23.280]  guys uh search uh drug could cure racism well that just means getting rid of a part of the brain
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:28.720]  that makes different calculations folks they're openly saying arrest us if we don't believe in
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:36.160]  man make global warming they're authoritarians we're all in danger this is a scientific dictatorship
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:42.240]  if corrupt elites had things that could make the public servile would they use them you bet
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:47.920]  they now admit they put the fluoride in the water to make a servile and to calcify the pineal gland
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:54.000]  the gland that does a chemical reaction with the cerebral cortex for deep spiritual moments
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:59.360]  when people can't be bought for money when people are ready to give their lives for others
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:04.960]  the system is afraid of that let's go to this pentagon briefing that got leaked i've now learned
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:10.960]  that the guy that released this was arrested oh yeah i tell you i'm glad that call or call i've
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:15.600]  been doing a lot of research during during the breaks the gentleman that leaked this and the
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:20.640]  pentagon is confirmed this is their video the guy that released this was arrested
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:31.360]  who was part of the program here is a pentagon briefing seven years ago in 2005 here it is
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:40.720]  light lit up this the right middle frontal gyrus shown here and that's a part of the brain that's
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:47.520]  associated with theory of mind it's a part of the brain that that has to do with intents and
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:54.160]  and beliefs and and desires in contrast in mark contrast here's an individual who would
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:27:02.480]  not particularly uh self-describe as as religious and when they're read a religious text what you
[02:27:02.480 --> 02:27:06.960]  see is that this part of the brain called the anterior insula lights up this is a part of
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:12.720]  the brain that's associated with with disgust or displeasure on hearing something uh you're
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:17.600]  suggesting i take a ct scan with me when i'm uh evaluating people to determine whether to put
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:27.040]  a bullet in their head so so um the the data that i'm presenting here uh supports the the
[02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:32.960]  concept that that we're proposing uh and i think that we would not propose to do
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:41.600]  ct scans or fmri's on on individuals out in the hinterlands of of afghanistan the virus
[02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:48.240]  would immunize against this v-mat 2 gene and that would would have the effect that you see here
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:54.400]  which is it's essentially to turn a fanatic into a a a normal person and we think that will have
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:59.280]  major effects in the middle east how would you suggest this is going to be dispersed aerosol
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:05.200]  well so so the present uh plan back it up back it up back up 10 seconds how do you
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:14.240]  propose us be dispersed aerosols again won't sell out has hardcore beliefs in the spiritual
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:19.840]  center of the brain we'll make them a normal person these people that don't care you see this
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:26.320]  professor at this big un event in europe calling for people's arrest and says we're mentally ill
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:34.160]  have to be reeducated into accepting what they say it's about making you do what they say headline
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:39.280]  climate change skeptic a sickness that must be treated says professor and i've asked paul to do a
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:44.000]  whole article going through how they're saying this everywhere they're saying arrest people these
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:51.120]  are authoritarians they'll do this and by the way the whistleblower that released this went on to
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:55.200]  break down and i've separately confirmed what's in here separately from government documents
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.480]  that they're already down giving this to the troops many of them and that they're looking at
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:09.200]  putting it in the flu shots we're in so much trouble we're the public are zombies a lot of them
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:14.480]  that got that flu shot let's get why they can't care anymore let's go back to the video go back
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:20.640]  essentially to turn a fanatic into a a normal person and we think that will have major effects
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:26.480]  in the middle east how would you suggest this is going to be dispersed aerosol well so so the
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:33.360]  the present plan and the tests that we've done so far have used respiratory viruses
[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:41.360]  such as flu or or rhino viruses and we believe that that's a satisfactory way to get the exposure
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:46.080]  of the largest part of the population most of us of course have had been exposed to both of those
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:53.360]  viruses all right folks we'll be back with a rest of it we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:57.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:21.040]  dot tv viewers climate change skepticism a sickness that must be treated says professor
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:25.120]  and when i called paul about his article this weekend that went mega viral and got picked up
[02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:32.240]  by scores of newspapers linking to her paper she was at the big un meeting planted under pressure
[02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:38.480]  for earth hour i said this isn't enough i want links to all the other places where this isn't
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:48.080]  just her they're openly saying everywhere arrest everybody arrest and reeducate us that's who we're
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:54.640]  dealing with you don't think people like that would not release stuff like this in a new york
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:01.360]  minute zoom in a little bit more on that for folks used to we can zoom right in and show people the
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:05.040]  text here i'll put it over there you can show people over there i'm going to put some other
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:09.520]  articles down there for the record climate change skepticism a sickness
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:17.280]  that must be treated says professor global warming alarmist acquits climate change with racism
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:22.960]  and so you've got to arrest these evil people let me show you some other stuff vaccine to stop
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:31.120]  heart attacks could be here in five years oh they care about us then i got a big stack of
[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:37.840]  articles we were able to dig up vaccines for drug addiction make the kids take them oh
[02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:45.280]  what's it do it's a live virus that eats holes in your brain i'm telling you ladies and gentlemen
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.160]  it is the end of humanity they're getting this all ready to give us soft kill weapons that make
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:55.200]  a servile jellyfish that even as they release the mega plagues of the future and almost everybody's
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:36:02.320]  dying folks will just be calm i don't know what the tv say okay and they'll just die with pleasure
[02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:08.800]  because those areas of their brain have been destroyed and that's why they want the air
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:14.320]  of spring to roll in with the inoculations with the chem trailing they've got to get in the air
[02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:20.080]  space we're hit with aluminum we're hit with barium all of it attacks the brain we're hit
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:26.240]  with the fluoride hits the exact areas that they associated in mammal studies and they admit in
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:31.680]  these documents they've been doing this to monkeys and now people at Abu Ghraib at the research
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:46.560]  facility and at camp x-ray in guantanamo that's what they want they want you oh man i just can't
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:51.760]  believe this i've always known this issue is ever and then for seven years this has been out there
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:56.800]  and it got leaked last year and they arrested the guy that released this video we're playing right now
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:02.800]  let's play just four minutes of it from the start and i got Watson doing a big article on this but
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:08.560]  if you want to find the article about how you won't be depressed anymore daily mail jab that could
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:15.200]  put a stop to stress without slowing us down forget the age old remedies of yoga meditation and
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:23.760]  popping pills receiving colonic stress chronic stress could soon be as simple as having an
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:29.680]  injection according to scientists and see they hide it in plain view oh we're just looking at a
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:35.760]  stress reliever like a cup of tea in the afternoon academics say they're close to developing the
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:41.280]  first vaccine for stress a single jab that could help us relax without slowing down being a good
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:46.960]  worker and i went and looked it up and it's one of the live viruses after 30 years of research into
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:52.880]  curious for stress dr robert sub poskey professor of neuroscience at stanford university in california
[02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:59.200]  believes it's possible to alter brain chemistry to create a state of focus calm they're gonna make
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:04.880]  us the better human they're gonna arrest us if we don't do what they say for climate change and give
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:12.400]  them all the power to aren't we lucky we've got them professor claims he is on the path
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:17.840]  genetically engineered formula that would resolve the need for relaxation or prescription drugs
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:25.360]  and it goes on with a special vaccine biologically designed by destroying brain cells
[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:37.200]  that are associated with causing the problem hmm oh yeah so shot yeah i mean it's like a science
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:44.320]  fiction movie you're gonna have the shot and then no more problems no more pain back to the pentagon
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:50.240]  briefing with the pentagon code i checked it all the pentagon they arrested the guy that released
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:56.960]  this joey lambardi i want to get ahold of him if he's out of jail he got arrested last year
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:01.440]  let's go ahead and go to this clip here it is excuse me on the left over here we have
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:08.720]  individuals who are religious fund fundamentalist religious fanatics and this is the expression
[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:17.360]  rt pcr real-time pcr uh expression of the v mat 2 gene over here we have individuals so so so
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:23.920]  so let me complete so over here we have individuals who are not particularly fundamentalist not
[02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:29.280]  particularly religious and you can see there's a much reduced expression of of this particular
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:36.880]  gene the the v mat 2 gene another evidence that that supports our our hypothesis for the development
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:47.520]  of of this approach what you see here is by by spreading this virus we're gonna eliminate individuals
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:54.320]  from dawning on a bomb bastard going into a market blowing up so our hypothesis is that these are
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:40:00.880]  fanatical people uh that they have overexpression of the v mat 2 gene and that by vaccinating them
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:07.600]  against this we'll eliminate this behavior uh so we have some some very very uh remarkable
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:16.320]  data in this next slide uh here we have two uh brain scans these are f m r i's uh these are two
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:22.560]  different individuals with different levels of expression that too uh on back it up 10 seconds
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:29.120]  thank you what do you think elites are going to do with weapons they're going to develop this stuff
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:37.520]  they have and they're going to deploy it you think autism going from one in 25 30 years ago
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:43.680]  to one in 50 something now you think cancer up over 10 000 percentage points in children
[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:51.520]  2000 percentage points in adults plus diabetes up 3000 plus percent type two alone juvenile
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:58.800]  onset epidemic neurological disorders epidemic bowel disorders epidemic do you think they're
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:06.880]  going to stop no they're not going to stop and now i went just during breaks and dug up that they are
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:11.200]  giving experimental vaccines for depression to the troops that that's what these are oh you're
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:15.280]  not going to be worried anymore that you've been here seven tears we're going to give you this shot
[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:19.520]  bubble you're going to get a fever and you ain't going to worry about nothing ever again you're
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:31.600]  going to go home and work at walmart and then die the cancer shots we already gave you
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:35.840]  and i know all these people out there because i talked to them sometimes they're like okay well
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:42.000]  you can't beat this i'm going to join it join with the devil basically you don't join with that you
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:47.920]  idiot all you do is fight this we've got to bring down the new world order we got to arrest all these
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:54.720]  people and notice they always get you to get rid of the bill of rights and constitution for some
[02:41:54.720 --> 02:42:00.160]  outside enemy like the muslims the muslims the new world order extremist muslims are run by the
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:05.200]  globalist on record i got stacks of news where they admit al-qaeda is the group they're using to go
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:10.880]  into syria you hear these pentagon doctors and psychiatrists going oh so you say this will
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:15.760]  stop a guy going to a market to blow people up well i'll and it'll stop troops from coming home
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:21.520]  and committing suicide because you won't have that fanatic over the edge willingness that's what
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:26.480]  they're scared of they're scared of when they push you around and try to hurt you and skill what you
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:31.760]  got you're going to fight back they're scared of it you give john wane a shot of this he goes over
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:41.600]  in the corner and does what he's told and it's communicable and listen it's not just this pentagon
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:46.480]  breathing i just read to you were oh you take this shot you're not going to get upset anymore
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:53.680]  you know what i like the fact i get upset it gives me energy that's the my love is passionate and my
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:58.560]  anger is passionate and you want to get rid of that you want to get rid of the fact that i'm
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:05.200]  willing to die you don't like the fact i'm committed you don't like the fact that i have this connection
[02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:11.040]  to god it's like the song yeah here come the visions here come the crystal visions i keep my
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:16.960]  visions to myself the system knows with their brain scans folks they know you're outside this world
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:23.920]  they know you're connected to things that are bigger they don't like it Beethoven music science
[02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:30.720]  quantum mechanics and every study is associated with these with the spiritual zones that they
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:37.280]  associate spirituality with they want that off they want it cut off if that isn't the devil i don't
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:45.520]  know what is they want to shut that down finish up the clip i'll try to shut up here it is here we
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:53.120]  have two brain scans these are fmri's these are two different individuals with different levels
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:44:00.800]  of expression of the matu on top is an individual who's a religious fanatic an individual and we've
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:08.720]  repeated this numerous times that that has high levels of the matu now this individual down here
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:16.320]  who had low levels of the b-matu gene this individual would self-describe as as as not
[02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:23.040]  particularly religious in in each case these individuals were were read a religious text
[02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:32.960]  this individual light lit up the right middle frontal gyrus shown here and that's a part of
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:39.440]  the brain that's associated with theory of mind it's a part of the brain that that has to do with
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:47.120]  intense and beliefs and desires in contrast in more contrast here's an individual who would
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:54.960]  not particularly self-describe as as religious and when they're read a religious text what you see
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:59.680]  is that this part of the brain called the anterior insula lights up this is a part of the brain that's
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:07.840]  associated with with disgust or displeasure on hearing something and pause back it up now notice
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:14.560]  that part of the brain's not just associated in the front right lobe with with religion it's again
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:22.560]  mathematics Beethoven fires in the minds of men what did thomas everson said he said we will ignite
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:30.960]  fires in the minds of men that's what that's the fire i feel it right now the fire the fire they
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:37.680]  want to extinguish the fire this is the greatest abomination i've ever seen i declare war against
[02:45:37.680 --> 02:45:45.840]  these people they want some lower brain you see what they just showed some lower brain not associated
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:54.400]  with genius some lower animal level that's disgusted by the fire in the mind oh i mean think of an
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:46:06.400]  enemy that comes for our fire that's who i am they want my soul and they cannot have it
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:13.040]  and they cannot have it by the way burning out my brain won't blot that out the spirit only interfaces
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:19.680]  with the brain you think you're going to blot out just by screwing up my earth suit you got
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:25.840]  another thing coming remember the luciferians they are religious they are aware of that but
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:30.720]  they're tuned to darkness this is the greatest abomination i've ever seen and it's hidden in
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:35.520]  plain view like hey trending there's going to be a shot we'll have focus calm no more will you be
[02:46:35.520 --> 02:46:43.840]  upset no more will you have a conscience let's go back to it this is so sick just and when they're
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:49.200]  read at religious text what you see is that this part of the brain called the anterior insula lights
[02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:54.880]  up this is a part of the brain that's associated with with disgust or displeasure on hearing something
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:47:08.960]  to scumbag so so um pause the the day show do you suggest i have a CT scan on the field
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:12.320]  see if i put a bullet in their head these guys are all real tough you know they're all out to do
[02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:16.880]  whatever they want you know we're fighting al-qaeda we're we get tough we're we're the government
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:23.920]  doctors we decide who gets the shots we decide who we lobotomize you've already been drinking at your
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:29.760]  whole life pal to make sure you never break through and stop caring about yourself and care about the
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:36.000]  creation of the creator and and and a greater whole they don't want you and your dna and everything
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:41.600]  you are to resonate they want to keep you down here in an animal level they want to shut down
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:49.520]  the intent the spark to creation the spark to resistance the spark to everything that makes
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:54.880]  humans so great i've told you looking at old films and things that electric spark that was in
[02:47:54.880 --> 02:48:00.240]  everybody's eyes a hundred years ago seven years ago it's dimmer and dimmer it's only in children's
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:05.600]  eyes now and they admit i saw big studies and Reuters this week that the computers are rewiring
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:10.560]  kids brain something we wrote about years ago and actually dumbing them down i mean you know
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:16.480]  we're a cursed nation and it's going to get a lot we're a cursed world where the pentagon sits
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:22.000]  around calmly talking about giving troops and hodges as they call them racially
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:27.600]  a vac chain he talked about a race specific weapon just to kill all the Arabs
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:32.800]  let's go ahead and go back to the tape let's go back here it is that i'm presenting here
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:42.240]  supports the the concept that we're proposing and i think that we would not propose to do
[02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:51.120]  CT scans or fmri's on on individuals out in the hinterlands of of Afghanistan the virus would
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:57.920]  immunize against this v-mat 2 gene and that would would have the effect that you see here which is
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:03.920]  back it up again back it up again back it up again back it up again back it up 10 seconds
[02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:11.280]  notice they all use words like the virus would go after the gene no they're calling the gene
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:17.840]  that grew your brain that way it eats the tissue so it's a virus eating the tissue
[02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:26.400]  but they call it the news focus calm not brain eating not taking your conscience focus calm
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:34.160]  oh the virus inoculates against this gene the virus is attacking your brain your brain they're
[02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:43.520]  saying is a disease because their disease crazy scientific control freaks most of them are are
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:49.680]  a bunch of illiterate gibbering morons who can hardly talk by the way let's go back to the enemy's
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:57.120]  minion here it is CT scans or fmri's on on individuals out in the hinterlands of of Afghanistan
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:04.560]  the virus would immunize again against this v-mat 2 gene and that would would have the effect that
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:10.800]  you see here which is it's essentially to turn a fanatic into a a normal person and we think
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:15.520]  that will have major effects in the Middle East how would you suggest this is going to be dispersed
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:21.200]  to show us all well so so the the present plan and the tests that we've done so far
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:30.640]  are have used respiratory viruses such as flu or or rhino viruses and we believe that that's
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:35.920]  a satisfactory way to get the exposure of the largest part of the population most of us of course
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:41.360]  have been exposed to both of those right there and the guy asked how do we deploy it and he said
[02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:52.720]  you just release it on everybody what did they find with the h1n1 turns out it was released five
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:58.800]  years ago and the centers for disease control admitted it was a quote simulant tracker virus
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:07.280]  was a brain eater folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the
[02:51:07.280 --> 02:51:12.320]  lights back on if so this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's
[02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:17.920]  never been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead here's why solar power
[02:51:17.920 --> 02:51:23.280]  generators are now available from our friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors
[02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:28.080]  their emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most
[02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:33.680]  unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity
[02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:38.640]  from the sun it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own whether
[02:51:38.640 --> 02:51:43.680]  it's ice storms brown ounce or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages
[02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:49.120]  again when the power goes out this winter you'll be ready with a solar power generator from solutions
[02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:54.720]  from science go to my solar backup dot com for more information that's my solar backup dot com

[02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:21.920]  all right this next video is of david rothkopf this article is up at info wars.com if you want to
[02:54:21.920 --> 02:54:28.480]  watch the full 30-something minute video but david rothkopf former head of the kissinger group
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:36.160]  CEO of gretchen rothkopf an author of power ink he also wrote a super class and admits the whole
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:41.680]  global government he's been on the show before refused to come back on the second time he thought
[02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:46.640]  i'd just come on and thought you'd be reasoned with you know you're part of the super class of
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:53.200]  media elix that's how they get people to get involved you're already on the show but here is
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:59.840]  rothkopf talking about civil unrest substantive civil unrest in the us by the bankers engineering
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:05.440]  this collapse so they hope to trigger a race war instead and out of the gun control by the way
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:13.360]  bill clinton has come out curtain embo's doing an article on it curtain obama has called for gun
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:20.880]  control at betray von martin so is joe biden and now bill clinton says restrict guns and now the
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:25.040]  fbis being sent in so we'll never find out the truth what happened with zemberman because this
[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:29.840]  is purely political trying to get a race war going that's one of our top articles in info wars.com
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:36.800]  i had a lot of news i didn't get to today because i spun off into this whole brain eating vaccine
[02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:43.680]  situation because what does any of this matter if they just start releasing stuff that openly
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:50.240]  reduces our iqs and kills that spark of intuition and understanding we have which is what they're
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:55.520]  attacking only the strongest of us have not succumbed to this most people know what's going on
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:56:01.040]  but say what are you going to do they've lost their will to resist their basic human will
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:08.160]  but those people don't count i'm sorry they're just casualties here we got a triage them those of us
[02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:13.200]  that haven't been completely destroyed by this have got to get with others and start warning people
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:20.800]  and start saying no to the system here's the david roth cop clip go ahead and roll it in 1950 if you
[02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:29.520]  dropped out of high school you go get a job at the jam factory have a decent life have a middle
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:34.880]  class life have opportunity for your children if you drop out of high school now you are destined
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:40.400]  to live in poverty you will not compete with people from these other places in the world

[02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:55.520]  states i think is a consequence of all of this so the balance matters and it's not to say leave it
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:57:02.160]  to the government and it's not to say leave it to the private sector it's to say that this struggle
[02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:07.520]  that's been going on for four or five hundred years to get the balance right and is an ongoing
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:13.600]  struggle is something we need to revisit we need to ask those questions why are their corporations
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:19.360]  why is their government what is the right mix between those things what can i learn from history
[02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:26.240]  so now the system is acting like they're trying to fix what they've engineered this is like a few
[02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:31.360]  years before they imploded this market and by design to get more power greenspan says oh we
