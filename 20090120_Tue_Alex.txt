[09:35.160 --> 09:41.480]  executive branch meet the new boss same as the old boss and what's so sad here
[09:41.480 --> 09:45.560]  is we see republicans after bush with the torture and the secret arrest and the
[09:45.560 --> 09:48.560]  attack on the bill of rights with the patriot act now being used against us
[09:48.560 --> 09:53.160]  citizens in non-terror related cases by tens of thousands every year as reported
[09:53.160 --> 09:57.520]  by the associated press conservatives committed themselves to bush despite the
[09:57.520 --> 10:00.920]  fact that he tripled the size of the federal government despite the fact he
[10:00.920 --> 10:05.280]  lied about every campaign promise and he lobbied for the assault weapons ban but
[10:05.280 --> 10:11.400]  failed the assault weapons ban renewal but because they invested in him
[10:11.400 --> 10:16.360]  psychologically they couldn't admit they were wrong and kind and so they would
[10:16.360 --> 10:19.920]  deny the north american union they would deny the million plus dead iraq he's in
[10:19.920 --> 10:26.840]  the war they would they they they signed on to evil and now you've got more than
[10:26.840 --> 10:32.120]  a hundred million americans that voted for barack obama and they saw the two
[10:32.120 --> 10:36.960]  elections stolen by bush they saw the supreme court appoint bush and they got
[10:36.960 --> 10:40.120]  fooled just like conservatives get fooled when bill clinton left office into
[10:40.120 --> 10:44.200]  supporting bush no matter what he did now they are totally psychologically signed
[10:44.200 --> 10:50.520]  on to whatever he says with zombie-like looks of rapture on their faces having no
[10:50.520 --> 10:54.640]  idea that this guy is going to completely betray them and has already
[10:54.640 --> 11:02.440]  betrayed them on every single front and the barack obama threat is much greater
[11:02.440 --> 11:06.360]  than i even had originally thought i have never in in any time in history
[11:06.360 --> 11:12.440]  studying history seen this level of concerted unified worship by the media
[11:12.440 --> 11:16.840]  to prepare the public to literally make this guy a dictator because the
[11:16.840 --> 11:21.160]  executive is already a dictatorship over the congress they have announced
[11:21.160 --> 11:28.680]  this tyrannical unlawful power and just as stalin killed at least himself
[11:28.680 --> 11:33.000]  lent kill around 10 million stalin killed at least 30 million in the several
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.520]  decades he was in power just as stalin did that and the public was told do what
[11:39.520 --> 11:43.120]  stalin says he'll fix it do what you know as they arrested people as they
[11:43.120 --> 11:45.680]  killed people by the millions as they starved in the death by the millions
[11:45.680 --> 11:50.120]  and even after it came out even in the soviet news that stalin was bad and
[11:50.120 --> 11:54.080]  horrible they still defended him and there are still old people in rusher
[11:54.080 --> 11:57.760]  today by the millions that go around wearing stalin t-shirts and holding up
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.200]  stalin signs because they can't admit they were wrong about endorsing and
[12:02.200 --> 12:07.760]  supporting joseph stalin there are still germans in germany who still love
[12:07.760 --> 12:13.480]  hitler because they can't admit they were wrong and consigning on to him there
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.120]  are tens of millions of chinese who still carry around the little red book
[12:18.120 --> 12:22.160]  and worship mouse a tongue even though after he died his wife who ran most of
[12:22.160 --> 12:26.680]  the executions was arrested by the communists themselves and the communists
[12:26.680 --> 12:31.360]  say that he killed 84 million the encyclopedia botanica says 62 million
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.280]  we don't know the chinese government says 80 plus million and did that
[12:36.280 --> 12:41.680]  research for the film endgame and they tens of millions of them still love him
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.600]  and because they were young teenagers when they signed on to be part of his
[12:46.600 --> 12:51.040]  youth corps outside of the communist party to go terrorize and attack and
[12:51.040 --> 12:55.280]  shout down anybody that got in his way and how did he start the youth corps
[12:55.280 --> 12:59.520]  after he already had power he said we're gonna help starving people with soup
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.160]  kitchens it sounded good it sounded reasonable and for a few years they did
[13:04.160 --> 13:06.840]  actually a lot of good work and then they said well we're good look we're
[13:06.840 --> 13:10.720]  doing good work and then it was yeah go ahead and assault that guy beat those
[13:10.720 --> 13:13.920]  people up run those people out of their businesses they're not going along with
[13:13.920 --> 13:18.000]  the cultural revolution and they go in houses and find bibles and beat people up
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.880]  and kill them and I'm telling you folks I've studied history webster tarpley was
[13:21.880 --> 13:26.600]  more right than I even gave him credit he is exactly right they are going to
[13:26.600 --> 13:31.640]  have a governmental mass-forced service and then even bigger separate from
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.360]  government thugs they're openly announcing that they're going to turn
[13:35.360 --> 13:39.960]  loose on us and to suck tens of millions of Americans into serving this at USA
[13:39.960 --> 13:45.520]  service dot org non-governmental they are getting them signed up in things that
[13:45.520 --> 13:49.480]  sound reasonable at first but when you read the fine print it's tabling on
[13:49.480 --> 13:55.880]  neighbors spying on people obama's announced it this is so incredible
[13:55.880 --> 14:01.240]  again ron paul joining us coming up in about twenty six minutes from now do we
[14:01.240 --> 14:07.360]  have lucrodowski from washington dc at the inauguration we're still waiting oh
[14:07.360 --> 14:14.640]  we have not given the producer his number so we need to get that to them in
[14:14.640 --> 14:21.720]  minnesota right now thank you so that is what is going on on this front right
[14:21.720 --> 14:29.560]  now ladies and gentlemen I did a 49 minute basic analysis last night at 1
[14:29.560 --> 14:34.440]  a.m. in my backyard when I try to get more focused more thoughtful late at night
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.960]  after a long day's work I tend to be a little calmer and I did this 49 minute
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.840]  analysis of audio blog that will be posted later on info wars dot com where I
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.800]  walk through many of the facets I'm going to attempt to do that in a focused
[14:48.800 --> 14:53.280]  manner with some of the other facets I haven't covered coming up later in the
[14:53.280 --> 15:02.760]  broadcast today so that is also coming up as well and again lucrodowski from the
[15:02.760 --> 15:06.040]  ground coming up
[15:09.440 --> 15:15.120]  we're gonna look in just a moment we have him on the line also the media is
[15:15.120 --> 15:22.080]  now doing a rearguard defensive action of george bush here's a fox news
[15:22.080 --> 15:27.760]  headline bashers in bush era deflated by lack of prosecution see you're just
[15:27.760 --> 15:31.520]  bashers it isn't that you're against millions of dead iraqis and lies and
[15:31.520 --> 15:36.120]  lies about wmds and fake weapons dossiers on yellow cake uranium and
[15:36.120 --> 15:39.840]  aluminum tubes it's not just that you don't like the torture camps and the
[15:39.840 --> 15:44.160]  attack on the constitution and the patriot act and all the things bush did
[15:44.160 --> 15:46.840]  are all the conservatives that don't like him for the north american union the
[15:46.840 --> 15:53.120]  transnafta highways no none of that matters now you're illegitimate you're
[15:53.120 --> 15:59.160]  just a bunch of bush bashers and you don't and so again so now the whole
[15:59.160 --> 16:03.640]  agenda stays no investigation of bush no reversals of anything just a few
[16:03.640 --> 16:07.440]  stunts obama will pull like shutting down guantanamo and abc news announces
[16:07.440 --> 16:11.960]  they're setting up internal guantanamo's at marine corps bases and navy bases
[16:11.960 --> 16:17.320]  here in the united states in california and south carolina and texas and other
[16:17.320 --> 16:22.560]  states this is so sick and i'm watching the people cry i'm watching them in
[16:22.560 --> 16:27.440]  rapture week after week on tv at these obama rallies i'm watching them on cnn
[16:27.440 --> 16:31.920]  right now while he speaks as if god is speaking and and and they're totally
[16:31.920 --> 16:35.920]  conned they think they're part of history they think they're part of
[16:35.920 --> 16:39.040]  something great they're scared by the economy they're scared by the wars
[16:39.040 --> 16:43.600]  they're scared by the terrorism and he's saying i'll fix it all just do whatever
[16:43.600 --> 16:47.960]  i say and when you read the fine print it is an even bigger government even
[16:47.960 --> 16:52.800]  bigger control more corporate looting more banks bankrupting us in and
[16:52.800 --> 16:57.640]  stealing trillions a week trillions a week and trillion plus dollar defense
[16:57.640 --> 17:01.280]  budgets and doubling the size of government again and another trillion
[17:01.280 --> 17:06.000]  dollars be given to select corporations to buy their support domestically in the
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.520]  united states this is what we're talking about
[17:10.520 --> 17:14.840]  and i pledge that i will defend the republic to the end i pledge that we
[17:14.840 --> 17:19.360]  have the next two hundred days even biden and all the pundits admit the
[17:19.360 --> 17:22.040]  vice president midst obama admits if they don't
[17:22.040 --> 17:24.440]  ram through
[17:24.440 --> 17:28.200]  their global warning taxes their control their youth brigades and launch it all
[17:28.200 --> 17:30.920]  in the first hundred and fifty two hundred days
[17:30.920 --> 17:34.360]  by then the public will be awake to them and they're not going to be able to get
[17:34.360 --> 17:38.480]  any of this through they they have got a tough job because everything they're
[17:38.480 --> 17:41.800]  really proposing that's why they don't like to publicize it but in the fine
[17:41.800 --> 17:46.440]  print is totally unpopular on average over ninety percent of the people in the
[17:46.440 --> 17:50.200]  polls are against it like the banker bailout ninety nine percent ninety eight
[17:50.200 --> 17:54.400]  percent depending on the poll like open borders ninety one percent gallop like
[17:54.400 --> 17:59.320]  the wars up to eighty percent against it so again he hasn't given specifics in
[17:59.320 --> 18:04.200]  the speeches but the fine print and his chief of staff and now the policies it's
[18:04.200 --> 18:07.880]  worse than we thought now in the last few days they've been launching new
[18:07.880 --> 18:11.840]  programs and it's really happening it's really going on
[18:11.840 --> 18:16.320]  let's go to the ground in the district of criminals the private district of
[18:16.320 --> 18:18.440]  columbia under the 13th amendment
[18:18.440 --> 18:19.920]  uh... slave grid

[18:38.200 --> 18:42.440]  everywhere you see everywhere you look at the security all over the place people
[18:42.440 --> 18:46.440]  could see the field but it's right now like on a we are going to see a live
[18:46.440 --> 18:51.080]  video before everything that's happening right now as it's going on right now you
[18:51.080 --> 18:54.680]  are right now behind that's no guard i'm right now behind a ticket service
[18:54.680 --> 18:58.040]  checkpoint and between the main checkpoint there are hundreds of people
[18:58.040 --> 19:01.960]  waiting to get into and not a late look what we're going to do is
[19:01.960 --> 19:05.960]  at at at the bottom of the hour we're gonna go live at prisonplanet.tv we're
[19:05.960 --> 19:08.040]  going to pick up that internet feed
[19:08.040 --> 19:10.200]  at prisonplanet.tv
[19:10.200 --> 19:13.040]  and we're gonna put that up on the site as well
[19:13.040 --> 19:15.720]  uh... so that we can show whatever your cameras are picking up there on the
[19:15.720 --> 19:18.360]  ground now be specific for us
[19:18.360 --> 19:21.680]  you say you saw people being searched by the national guard you saw families
[19:21.680 --> 19:26.000]  being searched by a regular army and by police in black uniforms forty seven
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.040]  thousand of them
[19:27.040 --> 19:28.760]  tell us what you're witnessing
[19:28.760 --> 19:32.040]  yeah people are just pretty much waiting to get searched waiting to get through
[19:32.040 --> 19:34.160]  the black fences and there's really
[19:34.160 --> 19:37.760]  hundreds if not thousands of people waiting at security checkpoints waiting
[19:37.760 --> 19:41.440]  to get through it is a horrible situation here nobody can get through
[19:41.440 --> 19:44.840]  anywhere the city is in Gerdlund there's police and ticket service on every
[19:44.840 --> 19:49.240]  street corner that you look on and ultimately they have set up these
[19:49.240 --> 19:52.960]  fences and they have little openings one little door opening and these fences
[19:52.960 --> 19:56.120]  that they expect thousands of people to go through and that's where you have to
[19:56.120 --> 19:58.160]  go through and that's where it's now security
[19:58.160 --> 20:01.040]  stay there, stay there, stay there, we'll be right back
[20:01.040 --> 20:01.960]  you worry
[20:01.960 --> 20:04.040]  you see the signs and worry about the future
[20:04.040 --> 20:06.640]  you worry about economic turmoil and food shortages
[20:06.640 --> 20:08.760]  how to be prepared while preserving your sanity
[20:08.760 --> 20:10.320]  your answer may be at hand
[20:10.320 --> 20:13.960]  author Linda Runyon lived off the land isolated from civilization
[20:13.960 --> 20:16.120]  she knows that as long as the sun shines
[20:16.120 --> 20:19.240]  there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth
[20:19.240 --> 20:23.200]  perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants
[20:23.200 --> 20:24.840]  the cost of learning is minimal
[20:24.840 --> 20:27.760]  wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere
[20:27.760 --> 20:31.200]  it's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets
[20:31.200 --> 20:32.760]  well respected in her field
[20:32.760 --> 20:36.440]  Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video
[20:36.440 --> 20:39.920]  with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy
[20:39.920 --> 20:44.720]  learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it

[20:57.920 --> 21:00.720]  a little knowledge makes starvation impossible
[21:00.720 --> 21:04.040]  a day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[21:04.040 --> 21:07.480]  a terrorist act of war against this country
[21:07.480 --> 21:10.120]  the enemy struck America on September 11th
[21:10.120 --> 21:11.680]  but who is the enemy?
[21:11.680 --> 21:12.480]  bin Laden
[21:12.480 --> 21:13.480]  this is his MO
[21:13.480 --> 21:16.840]  we have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[21:16.840 --> 21:20.560]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[21:20.560 --> 21:23.920]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[21:23.920 --> 21:28.600]  some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[21:28.600 --> 21:30.760]  in and on the U.S.
[21:30.760 --> 21:34.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[21:34.600 --> 21:39.880]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[21:39.880 --> 21:43.520]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government
[21:43.520 --> 21:46.000]  and much, much more fabled enemies
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.320]  get the DVD at infowars.com
[21:48.320 --> 21:53.640]  or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv
[21:53.640 --> 21:55.760]  either you are with us
[21:55.760 --> 22:01.400]  or you are with the terrorists
[22:01.400 --> 22:05.000]  as many people know ever since president Nixon took us off the gold standard
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.200]  the U.S. dollar has been evaluating what people don't know however
[22:08.200 --> 22:10.560]  is how this directly affects your personal finances
[22:10.560 --> 22:13.560]  is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[22:13.560 --> 22:15.600]  the answer to all of this is gold and silver
[22:15.600 --> 22:18.920]  they've both maintained their purchasing power for six thousand years
[22:18.920 --> 22:21.600]  if you had had one hundred thousand dollars in cash
[22:21.600 --> 22:25.360]  and one hundred thousand dollars in gold and silver back in nineteen thirteen
[22:25.360 --> 22:26.960]  and kept them both until now
[22:26.960 --> 22:31.120]  your cash would actually have the buying power of only four thousand eight hundred dollars
[22:31.120 --> 22:34.680]  but your gold and silver would have the buying power of three million dollars
[22:34.680 --> 22:36.760]  the answer to protecting your assets is simple
[22:36.760 --> 22:37.480]  call me

[23:04.040 --> 23:04.640]  what?
[23:04.640 --> 23:07.400]  seriously my memory and attention span is terrible
[23:07.400 --> 23:10.120]  I read something and forget I forget people's names
[23:10.120 --> 23:13.960]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people but I forget
[23:13.960 --> 23:15.680]  okay slow down
[23:15.680 --> 23:18.240]  poor attention and memory loss is not your fault
[23:18.240 --> 23:23.080]  factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods
[23:23.080 --> 23:25.400]  the way the education system taught you
[23:25.400 --> 23:27.040]  it's all meant to dumb you down
[23:27.040 --> 23:29.920]  you know I can remember everything now even entire books
[23:29.920 --> 23:30.800]  what how?
[23:30.800 --> 23:34.080]  there is this website called school of phenomenal memory
[23:34.080 --> 23:37.800]  their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement
[23:37.800 --> 23:43.120]  in fact they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information
[23:43.120 --> 23:47.240]  including entire books after they complete just sixty lessons
[23:47.240 --> 23:52.800]  and they offer a no questions asked no time limit money back guarantee
[23:52.800 --> 23:54.320]  wow what's the website?
[23:54.320 --> 24:20.880]  now don't forget it's pmemory.net the letter pmemory.net
[24:20.880 --> 24:25.520]  we're going to go right back to Luke Radowski we are change reporting live for infowars.com
[24:25.520 --> 24:29.840]  and we are change.org on the ground in DC
[24:29.840 --> 24:35.880]  and we just went live at prismplanet.tv we have his video feed up there right now from
[24:35.880 --> 24:40.680]  on the ground for folks watching at prismplanet.tv as well
[24:40.680 --> 24:45.720]  Luke specifically report for us the facts did you get through the first line of checkpoints
[24:45.720 --> 24:51.280]  and describe for us exactly what you witnessed with the military troops searching people?
[24:51.280 --> 24:56.680]  well we did not get through any search or checkpoints we were not able to at any point
[24:56.680 --> 25:02.560]  in time they pretty much closed off all of DC we are in track right now with black fences
[25:02.560 --> 25:06.760]  all around us we have a huge crowd all around us outside the main point but we are right
[25:06.760 --> 25:12.200]  on Pennsylvania avenue right outside the main address of varaco obama and to the left side
[25:12.200 --> 25:16.880]  if you look to the left side if you pan the camera down over there you are able to see
[25:16.880 --> 25:23.680]  the checkpoints you are able to see the national guard you are able to see the huge police
[25:23.680 --> 25:28.440]  state president here in washington dc and again we are in a huge crowd there are people
[25:28.440 --> 25:33.000]  crying there are people going ecstatic here not understanding how this is just a continuation
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.840]  of the policies and beliefs of the new world order of the police
[25:36.840 --> 25:40.480]  well it's turning America into a prison with these free speech zones and the rest of it
[25:40.480 --> 25:46.520]  yes I see your cameraman panning Luke have him pan into those police and troops that
[25:46.520 --> 25:50.480]  are over your other shoulder let's show the prison planet dot tv viewers that but for
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.320]  radio listeners describe what the troops are doing how they're searching people who they're
[25:56.320 --> 25:58.320]  letting through are you seeing them turn people away
[25:58.320 --> 26:03.600]  yeah they are turning a lot of people away they've closed off everything there's nowhere
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.520]  to go we are in track with huge amounts of people all around us there's national guard
[26:08.520 --> 26:13.520]  just panning around keeping an eye on everybody everybody's basically inscribed in these free
[26:13.520 --> 26:19.520]  speech zones and these black cars and these black cages everywhere and you see the crowd
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.520]  here right now not understanding what they're turned for and again
[26:23.520 --> 26:30.160]  and I can see I can see national guard on the on the screen I can see the national guard
[26:30.160 --> 26:33.360]  a sea of your cameraman can get around a few of those people and up to the fence because
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.080]  I can see the national guard but the video's a bit pixelated again this is the great technological
[26:38.080 --> 26:41.800]  developments of the free internet that they're openly in Obama and Biden have announced they're
[26:41.800 --> 26:46.120]  going to be shutting down and forcing everybody on the internet to where this will not be allowed
[26:46.120 --> 26:53.360]  except for major media companies to even do things like this so again they can't stand
[26:53.360 --> 26:57.360]  the fact we're able to show the prison planet dot tv viewers and everybody else this video
[26:57.360 --> 27:03.560]  thanks to the great work that we are changes doing down there now now Luke do I get you
[27:03.560 --> 27:07.360]  right that they're selectively not letting some people in but they're letting other people
[27:07.360 --> 27:11.640]  in at the checkpoints so how are they discriminating to decide who they're going to let in and
[27:11.640 --> 27:15.560]  who they're not going to let in well right now you can't have any bags you can't have
[27:15.560 --> 27:20.240]  any signs you can't have pretty much anything there are signs posted up anywhere that you
[27:20.240 --> 27:24.440]  could be searched in any time there's signs saying that you cannot have pretty much anything
[27:24.440 --> 27:29.160]  to go to the major checkpoint security line right now it looks like most of our speech
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.400]  is ending right now the national guard or here I don't know if you can see it on camera
[27:33.400 --> 27:37.320]  you can see them in the middle of the street but they're literally on every three corner
[27:37.320 --> 27:42.200]  we walked around here for about 40 blocks trying to get into the main checkpoint area
[27:42.200 --> 27:48.240]  and we were not able to any point on time and literally every one of you and again billions
[27:48.240 --> 27:52.640]  of people worldwide are saying around 3 billion people are tuned into this they're all being
[27:52.640 --> 27:57.320]  conditioned the troops on the streets checkpoints people being searched as normal and folks in
[27:57.320 --> 28:01.120]  the past would deny that this was conditioning now they admit they're going to use these
[28:01.120 --> 28:07.360]  20,000 troops and growing against the American people that they have stated on record that
[28:07.360 --> 28:11.840]  this is to be used for civil insurrection against the American people and Barack Obama
[28:11.840 --> 28:16.420]  says get ready for pain get ready for skin in the game his wife and these public service
[28:16.420 --> 28:21.040]  announcements is saying get ready for really hard times because they are allowing the banks
[28:21.040 --> 28:26.920]  to steal trillions of dollars a week from the American people this is a mass heist and
[28:26.920 --> 28:31.360]  those troops compartmentalized unknowingly are there to make sure that the heist goes
[28:31.360 --> 28:35.600]  according to plan again earlier we could hear Obama finishing his speech in the background
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.600]  and the cheers of the mindless sheep as they go into the depths of a Stalinist system continue
[28:40.600 --> 28:44.680]  yeah we're going to be going we're going to be doing interviews and people on the street
[28:44.680 --> 28:48.160]  here right after we get off the phone with you but it looks like everything is ending
[28:48.160 --> 28:52.360]  right now we're still trapped here on Pennsylvania Avenue we're covering everything alive at
[28:52.360 --> 28:56.640]  this happening we're here by one of the major checkpoint they're not allowing anybody in
[28:56.640 --> 29:00.480]  we're going to try to get into some places but we're here covering everything well it's
[29:00.480 --> 29:04.800]  not ending a buy a Biden's giving a speech others are going to give speeches in fact

[33:52.000 --> 33:55.960]  to some of these obamanoids let's talk to some of these cult members who are well meaning
[33:55.960 --> 34:00.480]  but have been completely conned just like Bush supporters were Luke Radowski on the
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.520]  ground in DC there were the National Guard troops surrounding him no no but you're saying
[34:05.520 --> 34:09.960]  you can't end the war we got some people right here we're talking to why can't we end the
[34:09.960 --> 34:13.760]  war you can't end the war instantly the way people are American people think that it can
[34:13.760 --> 34:19.040]  happen it has to be a species planning because you will murder more American soldiers if
[34:19.040 --> 34:23.560]  you just hold them out instantly oh really you'll murder more soldiers say this is a
[34:23.560 --> 34:28.000]  state we're going to see you down for a minute you hear this this is what bush has said to
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.640]  keep us in there five and a half years he promised six months five and a half almost six years
[34:32.640 --> 34:38.440]  later this is the same now they picked up all the bush MO which is really the elite propaganda
[34:38.440 --> 34:43.000]  and then notice this lady a year ago I guarantee was bashing Bush saying in it now now since
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  Obama's saying we got to keep them in there for a few more years listen to her go back
[34:46.000 --> 34:50.000]  to her yeah yeah we're talking to her right now we're trying to explain that obamanoids
[34:50.000 --> 34:53.840]  for a surge in Afghanistan he's going to take the troops from Iraq and send them to
[34:53.840 --> 35:03.000]  Afghanistan I mean that's not ending war is it Luke ask her ask her this question Luke
[35:03.000 --> 35:14.640]  Luke give her the phone I want to talk to her give her the phone hi ma'am how you doing
[35:14.640 --> 35:19.840]  listen listen we're not bush supporters we're not Republicans we know that Obama has the
[35:19.840 --> 35:23.680]  same advisors and is going to betray everybody remember he said he was going to pull the
[35:23.680 --> 35:30.000]  troops out let me just finish now now he's saying he's not going to he said he wouldn't
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.760]  have wiretaps against the American people without warrants now he's saying he's going
[35:34.760 --> 35:38.600]  ahead he said he was going to get rid of the Patriot Act now he's saying he's not going
[35:38.600 --> 35:44.120]  to do that all we're saying is is that you are here's my question and then I'll let you
[35:44.120 --> 35:48.480]  answer it you are saying that if we pull all the troops out more will get killed more troops
[35:48.480 --> 35:51.880]  the troops can't be killed if they're pulled out of Iraq and all the major governmental
[35:51.880 --> 35:57.040]  studies admit that if the troops are pulled out there'll be less deaths on all sides but
[35:57.040 --> 36:02.720]  strategically he has to pull the troops out and we can also we cannot abandon and I'm
[36:02.720 --> 36:08.320]  a person against war and it's funny because all my family is military and we have arguments
[36:08.320 --> 36:13.000]  at our table all the time but I truly understand that we just can't go in and say okay we're
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.880]  pulling all these troops out and we leave the people in our right man they built man
[36:16.880 --> 36:22.000]  they've built thirty plus permanent giant bases that hold three or four thousand five
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.400]  thousand one when case six thousand people apiece they're never leaving the Pentagon
[36:25.400 --> 36:31.240]  says that we're going to have troops there in twenty years you've been deceived oh no
[36:31.240 --> 36:33.920]  no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[36:33.920 --> 36:34.940]  no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[36:34.940 --> 36:37.700]  I guess you don't understand my argument because when he was talking about how he was going
[36:37.700 --> 36:42.480]  to pull the troops out I was one of the first people whoever say where I live at you can't
[36:42.480 --> 36:47.080]  do that. And he's going to have to be longer than what he expects to have missed. But what
[36:47.080 --> 36:51.800]  I'm saying is that the American people have to wive up themselves and realize, we just
[36:51.800 --> 36:57.680]  can't hear beeping. Somebody's beeping here. We just can't pull those troops out the way
[36:57.680 --> 37:02.760]  he says he will. And American people are blind to the fact it will not happen.
[37:02.760 --> 37:05.560]  Ma'am, ma'am, I have one other question for you and I'm going to let you go. We got Congress
[37:05.560 --> 37:11.000]  from Ron Park coming up. Go ahead and get him online, John, in Minnesota. And it's this,
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.560]  we've heard about his National Compulsory Service 18-24. Do you support forced National
[37:16.560 --> 37:22.760]  Compulsory Service? Okay. I'm going to brief me about that, yes.
[37:22.760 --> 37:25.720]  Do you support that? No.
[37:25.720 --> 37:31.840]  Okay. Do you support that Obama spearheaded the banker takeover that's now 8.5 trillion
[37:31.840 --> 37:35.960]  and it's secret and they won't say where it is? Just like Bush supported it, Obama says
[37:35.960 --> 37:39.000]  we have to have another banker bailout. Do you support that?
[37:39.000 --> 37:44.520]  No, I'm not into bailout at all. So what is it you support? What is it, man, you support
[37:44.520 --> 37:53.800]  about Barack Obama? I am torn between supporting him to be honest with you and my family is
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.800]  a family full of Democrats. So I'm torn between supporting him at any political party at
[37:59.800 --> 38:04.000]  just 20 times because I think the American people with both parties have been deceived
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  and who is American? We have to open up our eyes and decide what we're going to do for
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  our country.
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.640]  Man, listen, Obama is a corporate created foundation frontman. He is going to betray
[38:14.640 --> 38:20.440]  you. Don't sign on like the Germans did or the Russians did to Stalin and then sign
[38:20.440 --> 38:24.360]  on to all as evil. Like conservatives signed on to Bush and then the torture, the secret
[38:24.360 --> 38:29.800]  arrest, the wars. Don't be conned. God bless you. Luke Radowski on the ground in Washington,
[38:29.800 --> 38:34.360]  D.C., surrounded by regular army troops and National Guard searching everyone. We'll talk
[38:34.360 --> 38:38.480]  to you coming up in the next hour. Luke Radowski, thanks for reporting for infowars.com from
[38:38.480 --> 38:39.480]  the streets of D.C.
[38:39.480 --> 38:40.480]  Okay.
[38:40.480 --> 38:47.480]  Thank you so much. I'm here. We're going to be talking to more people. We're going to
[38:47.480 --> 38:50.480]  be talking to people as long as the battery dies out.
[38:50.480 --> 38:55.920]  Okay. Luke, we got to jump. Again, they're streaming live at prisonplanet.tv with a video
[38:55.920 --> 39:00.320]  feed from there on the ground. Now without further ado, Congressman Ron Paul for the
[39:00.320 --> 39:07.880]  next 20 minutes joins us. Congressman, the 44th president with messianic media coverage.
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.360]  I mean, is this good in history? We've never seen this in American history. To have someone
[39:12.360 --> 39:17.640]  being worshiped and the media saying get behind him, do whatever he says, and then Obama says
[39:17.640 --> 39:23.920]  another banker bailout, a new bank of the U.S. that's private, just youth brigades.
[39:23.920 --> 39:33.120]  He's formed usaservice.org, a private army for himself to go out and ensure his policies
[39:33.120 --> 39:35.800]  literally out of mouse playbook. Congressman?
[39:35.800 --> 39:41.880]  Well, no, I don't think it's a good idea at all. And he can fool a lot of people. But
[39:41.880 --> 39:47.600]  you know, I was watching the speech that he gave on the business station. It was interesting.
[39:47.600 --> 39:53.040]  He wasn't reassuring the market. I mean, gold is up sharply and the Dow Jones is down sharply.
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.600]  So if he really was reassuring us that he was going to take care of us, I think the
[39:57.600 --> 40:01.640]  markets would have acted differently. But a lot of people are fooled and a lot of people
[40:01.640 --> 40:07.800]  are expecting a whole lot and think that he is going to be a savior. But I think it will
[40:07.800 --> 40:08.800]  be short-lived.
[40:08.800 --> 40:15.760]  Congressman, as you know, they've introduced a new bill to give dictatorial power to the
[40:15.760 --> 40:21.760]  Attorney General to where he can ban any semi-automatic or any quote rifles that could have a military
[40:21.760 --> 40:27.320]  use, most rifles and shotguns and handguns. That has been introduced. They're introducing
[40:27.320 --> 40:32.600]  a bill to nationally register all firearms. I mean, out of the gates, he's saying he's
[40:32.600 --> 40:39.280]  going to call for a carbon tax and declare CO2 a toxic waste. If we thought Bush tripling
[40:39.280 --> 40:43.200]  the size of government was bad, what are we facing, sir? And what are the biggest threats
[40:43.200 --> 40:46.440]  right now from the new Obama administration that just launched?
[40:46.440 --> 40:52.920]  Well, he'll make it grow much faster if the whole system hangs together for that long.
[40:52.920 --> 40:57.080]  But the big question is whether there's going to be a collapse of the dollar and all bets
[40:57.080 --> 41:02.920]  are off on what will transpire then. But no, if we go along with the system held together
[41:02.920 --> 41:07.600]  relatively so, I mean, he's going to massively increase the government. I think there'll
[41:07.600 --> 41:14.160]  be national youth service and also possibility of a military draft. I think there'll be expansion
[41:14.160 --> 41:19.360]  of operations overseas. And the only way they know how to play for any of this is printing
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.680]  more money. That's why it's a contest. How long can this go on by massively expanding
[41:24.680 --> 41:28.760]  the size of government and undermining the value of the dollar before people give up
[41:28.760 --> 41:34.240]  on the dollar? So it'll be interesting to see what's happened. I find it fascinating.
[41:34.240 --> 41:39.400]  Tragically, though, it's so dangerous that you can't really sit back and relax about
[41:39.400 --> 41:41.600]  it. We all have to prepare for what's going on.
[41:41.600 --> 41:46.960]  We're talking to Congressman Ron Paul from Texas, and he joins us for the balance of
[41:46.960 --> 41:51.600]  the hour. Congressman, specifically, let's talk about solutions and then get into more
[41:51.600 --> 41:57.640]  of the threats. Obama, Biden, the pundits, they all admit that he'll have about 150,
[41:57.640 --> 42:02.560]  200 days. He's saying he's going to have a blitzkrieg of gun control legislation, illegal
[42:02.560 --> 42:09.400]  alien amnesty, carbon taxes, new federal agencies, new wars, record defense budgets,
[42:09.400 --> 42:13.120]  and they're saying that they know that things are going to be so bad in the economy. They're
[42:13.120 --> 42:17.600]  saying this in speeches. They're saying it's going to get painful. It's going to be austerity.
[42:17.600 --> 42:23.400]  Get ready. We've got to give trillions a week to the bankers. How important is it now to
[42:23.400 --> 42:29.720]  resist this agenda and point it out and organize the huge Ron Paul liberty movement that Obama
[42:29.720 --> 42:36.000]  mimics successfully with a false organic movement? How important is it and how do we mobilize
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.920]  and what are the key things to fight in the first 200 days if we're going to save this
[42:39.920 --> 42:43.720]  republic? Because you've always talked about that coming crisis when the world government
[42:43.720 --> 42:48.480]  imploded the economy by design so they could rebuild it with even greater control that
[42:48.480 --> 42:52.520]  we could use that key window to reverse it and bring in the culture of liberty.
[42:52.520 --> 42:57.280]  Well, we have to continue to do exactly what we're doing, trying to win people over to
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.760]  our side, spread the message, get the attention of Washington the best we can. Now, the one
[43:01.760 --> 43:07.920]  way we could look at this in a positive way is those republicans who wimped along and
[43:07.920 --> 43:13.840]  did everything George Bush told them to do are now resistors. So we have more resistance
[43:13.840 --> 43:18.680]  there. We're going to hear more noise in Washington against Obama than we ever heard
[43:18.680 --> 43:22.280]  against George Bush because the democrats love George Bush and the republicans wouldn't
[43:22.280 --> 43:28.720]  say boo. At least we'll have a little bit of that, but the problem is in 100 days or
[43:28.720 --> 43:35.840]  200 days. I mean, we do our best, but we can't really expect to reverse this tide because
[43:35.840 --> 43:41.720]  he's assuming that he has this mandate and he's going to march forward. And how we act
[43:41.720 --> 43:46.840]  when an acute monetary crisis hits is something that has to be determined then. But in the
[43:46.840 --> 43:52.560]  meantime, people have acted in their own best interest. It didn't take individuals very
[43:52.560 --> 43:56.440]  long to figure out that there would be more controls on guns, all of a sudden gun sales
[43:56.440 --> 44:01.080]  soared and prices of guns soared. Ammunition, they're afraid the ammunition will be taken
[44:01.080 --> 44:06.560]  away or registered and those prices have soared. People learn how to make their own ammunition.
[44:06.560 --> 44:12.200]  So all kinds of things automatically happen. I don't think you have to have one group or
[44:12.200 --> 44:17.680]  one person tell everybody what they have to do. My goal has always been to get information
[44:17.680 --> 44:24.080]  out there and try to counteract the socialistic totalitarian ideas with the ideas of freedom.
[44:24.080 --> 44:29.440]  More specifically, you're on the House Banking Committee. Bloomberg and AP report five weeks
[44:29.440 --> 44:35.360]  ago, the last time we saw numbers, that it was $1,300,000,000,000 a week disappearing
[44:35.360 --> 44:41.120]  and the Federal Reserve will not tell Congress or anywhere else where the money has gone.
[44:41.120 --> 44:48.680]  Now they're saying they need a trillion more to, quote, unfreeze these toxic derivatives,
[44:48.680 --> 44:53.160]  these instruments. Can you specifically speak because now Newsweek has the headline, a world
[44:53.160 --> 44:58.280]  government run by a world bank. The very people that engineered the crisis are now openly
[44:58.280 --> 45:03.560]  proposing a world government run by the very private central banks that have hijacked our
[45:03.560 --> 45:10.440]  economy and are looting us in a financial coup. I mean, this is so huge, it's just hard
[45:10.440 --> 45:18.080]  to even analyze something this brazen with this much Hootspah. I mean, my question is,
[45:18.080 --> 45:22.560]  you're on the Banking Committee, we have this giant heist going on. They're openly announcing
[45:22.560 --> 45:26.960]  the world government saying we're going to pay carbon taxes to this new central bank.
[45:26.960 --> 45:31.640]  This is outrageous. This is totally unpopular in all the polls. 98% are against it. How
[45:31.640 --> 45:37.920]  is, I mean, is the elite pinning everything on Obama, hoping that with this messianic
[45:37.920 --> 45:43.480]  fervor and hype that somehow he can bring this through and get it done?
[45:43.480 --> 45:51.320]  I think so. And maybe they also are indeed planning right now for the crisis that we
[45:51.320 --> 45:56.840]  expect. With a dollar collapse, they want to be in a position worldwide to devise the
[45:56.840 --> 46:03.120]  next system. So I'm sure they're making their plans for that as well. Last week, we had
[46:03.120 --> 46:09.280]  a vote on an amendment on the bill that did not get passed by any Franks bill on the tarp
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.760]  funds. And the amendment had to do with demanding that the Federal Reserve turn over the information
[46:14.760 --> 46:19.000]  about where all these credits are going. And I think it passed over one. I think it passed
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.520]  unanimously. So the sentiment is changing. And we are specifically at my request going
[46:24.520 --> 46:29.520]  to have hearings in a couple of weeks that Barney Frank has agreed to. And that is to
[46:29.520 --> 46:34.400]  get Bernanke in front of the committee and give us more information about what we're
[46:34.400 --> 46:38.800]  doing. I don't think much will come of it. I don't think because we're having these
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.440]  hearings and he's coming that all of a sudden they're going to do it. But the sentiment
[46:43.440 --> 46:47.320]  is growing. The people want the information. The people are tired of it and they're getting
[46:47.320 --> 46:53.160]  frightened and the members of Congress evidently know about it. But in the meantime, though,
[46:53.160 --> 46:58.000]  when you hear speeches like we just heard and the plans being laid and the internationalism
[46:58.000 --> 47:03.240]  that goes on, I think there's a lot of plans going on right now on what they're going to
[47:03.240 --> 47:04.800]  replace the dollar system with.
[47:04.800 --> 47:09.120]  Well, the good news, sir, as you know, everything you've been talking about for 30 years has
[47:09.120 --> 47:14.200]  now come true. It's sad that you were right, but we've now hit the iceberg. And our credibility
[47:14.200 --> 47:18.960]  is the liberty movement, the freedom movement, libertarian movement, true conservative movement
[47:18.960 --> 47:23.280]  is exploding right now. So I mean, I guess that is the opportunity in all of this. Now,
[47:23.280 --> 47:30.120]  Henry Kissinger two weeks ago on MSNBC, I don't know if you saw it, said Obama is worshiped
[47:30.120 --> 47:31.120]  worldwide.
[47:31.120 --> 47:38.160]  We can use his personality as a plus with this global crisis to bring in the new world
[47:38.160 --> 47:39.160]  order.
[47:39.160 --> 47:45.400]  Yeah. And you know, the first president that ever said that in open discussion was George
[47:45.400 --> 47:51.280]  Bush senior when he talked about the new world order before many talked about it. And we
[47:51.280 --> 47:56.200]  had read about it. And if you believed in it, you know, you were some nut, but George
[47:56.200 --> 48:02.520]  Bush talked about it openly. So it is more likely to be mentioned. And I did hear Kissinger's
[48:02.520 --> 48:07.360]  comments. And I think that's what they're really working on because they're not going
[48:07.360 --> 48:12.760]  to move back to the original order of individual freedom and limited government and a very
[48:12.760 --> 48:17.560]  small federal government. That of course is what we want. And yet they want to move in
[48:17.560 --> 48:22.880]  the opposite direction. But you know, chaos that comes might offer some opportunity as
[48:22.880 --> 48:27.840]  well because it's going to be very difficult to manage hundreds of millions of people.
[48:27.840 --> 48:31.560]  I've got on screen for the prisonplanet.tv viewers for radio listeners. I'm going to
[48:31.560 --> 48:36.720]  play a 30 second clip. Here is Henry Kissinger saying use Obama and his incredible world
[48:36.720 --> 48:41.280]  support in the image of him to ram through the new world order using the crises they've
[48:41.280 --> 48:45.200]  engineered to bring us even deeper under their control. Here it is.
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.320]  So he can't really say that it's one problem, that it's the most important one. But he can
[48:50.320 --> 48:58.240]  give new impetus to American foreign policy partly because the reception of him is so
[48:58.240 --> 49:05.160]  extraordinary around the world. I think his task will be to develop an overall strategy
[49:05.160 --> 49:10.760]  for America in this period when really a new world order can be created. It's a great
[49:10.760 --> 49:13.840]  opportunity. It isn't such a crisis.
[49:13.840 --> 49:16.840]  Are you confident about the people?
[49:16.840 --> 49:23.360]  Okay. Congressman specifically, the trilateral commission in 74 said that within three decades
[49:23.360 --> 49:27.440]  they would engineer a world banking collapse knowing their fiat system had to implode and
[49:27.440 --> 49:33.120]  that they would then offer a global bank that sets currency rates for the major 10 nations
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.640]  or major 10 regions. Club of Rome said it as well. Again, how do we stop this?
[49:37.640 --> 49:43.320]  Well, I think the market will eventually stop it because what they're trying to impose
[49:43.320 --> 49:47.240]  on us is not workable. It's sort of, but we don't know the timing. We knew the Soviet
[49:47.240 --> 49:51.760]  system wouldn't work because socialism doesn't work. But just look at the pain and the suffering
[49:51.760 --> 49:57.240]  that occurred for many, many decades. But it was predicted by Austrian economics that
[49:57.240 --> 50:02.120]  the Soviet system would collapse and it did. And what they're proposing can't work either.
[50:02.120 --> 50:07.560]  The big thing is politically, how much pain and suffering are we going to go through?
[50:07.560 --> 50:11.640]  People should be ready to deal in the market, the real marketplace. They may have to use
[50:11.640 --> 50:17.680]  gold and silver coins, but internationally they're going to play games with it. They're
[50:17.680 --> 50:23.440]  not going to give up easily, but we do know it always fails. They couldn't maintain the
[50:23.440 --> 50:28.200]  Bretton Woods system and they can't maintain the system that came out of Bretton Woods.
[50:28.200 --> 50:33.480]  That's not been maintained and it's collapsing at this very moment. And the one they're talking
[50:33.480 --> 50:38.320]  about won't work either. The big question is how far along can they get and will our
[50:38.320 --> 50:40.840]  movement grow fast enough to counteract them?
[50:40.840 --> 50:44.760]  Congressman, stay there. I'm skipping this network break, not just the prison planet.tv
[50:44.760 --> 50:49.040]  break. So John, just suspend this break as we go out. We're skipping the network breaks.
[50:49.040 --> 50:53.520]  We can go right to the end of the hour with Ron Paul. This information is too vital. This
[50:53.520 --> 51:02.120]  is a network break. So stations, stay with us. We're going live continually. Okay. Congressman,
[51:02.120 --> 51:06.280]  continuing here with you, sir, live on air. I've been asking a lot of questions. I've
[51:06.280 --> 51:09.680]  been bringing up a lot of points. What are some points you'd like to make, sir, today
[51:09.680 --> 51:13.240]  to the viewers and listeners?
[51:13.240 --> 51:18.640]  The optimistic side is that we're very pleased with our organization around the country, especially
[51:18.640 --> 51:23.400]  on the college campuses. The more I think about it, the more excited I get about reaching
[51:23.400 --> 51:28.800]  out to a generation that most people believe are all with Obama. I don't happen to believe
[51:28.800 --> 51:33.320]  that. Even the statistics show that they didn't necessarily come out and vote the way that
[51:33.320 --> 51:40.880]  people thought. So that we should have some optimism that we can reach in the next generation.
[51:40.880 --> 51:46.320]  But we have a lot of activity going on, but we do live in very, very dangerous times.
[51:46.320 --> 51:50.800]  And hopefully we can work within the system before it breaks down completely, which means
[51:50.800 --> 51:55.400]  people should be involved and try to influence their members and get involved in campaigns
[51:55.400 --> 51:57.520]  and try to get me some help in Washington.
[51:57.520 --> 52:03.800]  Sir, we know that governments love to stage events or use events to get more power and
[52:03.800 --> 52:08.200]  control. Are you worried about Gulf of Tonkin events continuing? Obama has said he wants
[52:08.200 --> 52:13.920]  to deal with Iran and swiftly in the next year. Are you concerned about staged events?
[52:13.920 --> 52:20.760]  Yes, you know, a year or so ago, I think because so many times we had expressed concerns about
[52:20.760 --> 52:25.640]  this, they actually backed off when we were worried about a staged event for an excuse
[52:25.640 --> 52:31.920]  to go into Iran. And Bush backed off, I think, because of some of the publicity we gave to
[52:31.920 --> 52:37.760]  that. But no, I think all big events like that in foreign policy have to have a staged
[52:37.760 --> 52:44.680]  event or used an event that they can claim is the main reason for going in. But policies
[52:44.680 --> 52:48.280]  have not changed on foreign policy. If you listen to his speech, he said nothing that
[52:48.280 --> 52:54.240]  would be different. He is still, you know, going to follow the same foreign policy.
[52:54.240 --> 52:57.760]  Well, that's the good news. I mean, not that he's following the policy, but the good news
[52:57.760 --> 53:02.120]  is I am talking to Obama supporters. We just talked to one on the ground at D.C. And they
[53:02.120 --> 53:05.480]  were admitting, yeah, he is continuing the wars. Yeah, he is continuing the war unless
[53:05.480 --> 53:09.320]  wiretapping. Yeah, he is saying he's going to keep trips in Iraq basically forever, just
[53:09.320 --> 53:13.880]  a smaller group. Yeah, he is going back on everything he said. So I see them kind of
[53:13.880 --> 53:18.600]  getting apprehensive. So the mainstream corporate media, the establishment comes in and says,
[53:18.600 --> 53:22.360]  look, he's a good guy. He'll save you. Just do whatever he says, knowing he's carrying
[53:22.360 --> 53:28.480]  the ball for the elite agenda to get through what they want. So can you speak to that?
[53:28.480 --> 53:35.000]  Well, I think this is good that some of the Obama supporters are starting to recognize
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.640]  this. And we shouldn't ignore the fact that some of our allies may well come from the
[53:39.640 --> 53:45.960]  left. The principle liberal or a progressive who doesn't fit the mold of an Obama supporter
[53:45.960 --> 53:50.080]  are very concerned about the same things we are, you know, about the Patriot Act and
[53:50.080 --> 53:57.360]  personal liberty and the foreign policy. And in time, I think that we can work with other
[53:57.360 --> 54:01.800]  groups because we'll need everybody to point out that it's civil liberties that we want
[54:01.800 --> 54:06.560]  protected. We want personal liberty protected. At the same time, we don't need any more wars,
[54:06.560 --> 54:12.160]  which will help us economically. You know, the other arguments can be done, but we do
[54:12.160 --> 54:18.720]  need a strong coalition. But you'd never know that we are very strong from the average news
[54:18.720 --> 54:24.560]  class every day and what we saw today. But I think our numbers are growing and there's
[54:24.560 --> 54:30.280]  reasons to for us to continue this effort. Absolutely, Congressman. In the four minutes
[54:30.280 --> 54:36.200]  we have left with you, I want to get you to specifically speak to this because I know
[54:36.200 --> 54:43.680]  you're a student of history and a avid news hound. And so I specifically wanted to get
[54:43.680 --> 54:49.320]  your take on this because I've studied Hitler, Stalin, Mao and literally even the Washington
[54:49.320 --> 54:54.240]  Post a week ago admitted that the symbolism, the things they're doing is classical fascism
[54:54.240 --> 54:59.480]  or communism where these evil movements of the state want a true grassroots army. And
[54:59.480 --> 55:06.080]  now with USA service.org, it's a separate group under Obama's control. And there are
[55:06.080 --> 55:09.120]  already getting hundreds of thousands that launched a week ago. They're running National
[55:09.120 --> 55:14.800]  Ad Council federally paid for ads promoting his private army, which I believe is illegal
[55:14.800 --> 55:21.360]  according to the congressional research that's been done. I hope you'll investigate that.
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.520]  So specifically just on that one issue, there's hundreds. This is classical, the dirtiest,
[55:26.520 --> 55:32.080]  most wicked type of pathogen to a free society and they're doing it out of the gates. So
[55:32.080 --> 55:38.160]  can you speak to the whole messianic thing? Well, the messianic thing is very obvious
[55:38.160 --> 55:41.920]  to most people and we should be very cautious about it as far as a private army goes. I
[55:41.920 --> 55:46.560]  don't know enough to say that I have all the answers on that, but it certainly deserves
[55:46.560 --> 55:52.200]  looking at. I think the big thing right now, which is progressing as it has been for years
[55:52.200 --> 55:58.160]  and more so now is not so much that Obama is going to present socialism in the Soviet
[55:58.160 --> 56:04.000]  style or government ownership. It's always going to be this business arrangement between
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.240]  big business and big government. It's more fascism. They socialize our wealth and then
[56:09.240 --> 56:15.400]  give it to the banks. That's right. And he was emphatic today and said that, yes, markets
[56:15.400 --> 56:21.000]  are good and the free enterprise they do produce, but on occasion they spin out of control and
[56:21.000 --> 56:26.240]  they fail and therefore we have to step in. What he was saying there, which was what they
[56:26.240 --> 56:32.760]  said in the 30s is capitalism, gold standard, freedom failed, so therefore we need government.
[56:32.760 --> 56:37.680]  And just look, do you think the business man is resisting that? The business man is begging
[56:37.680 --> 56:43.440]  to be partners. Exactly. But what's really failed is this fascist slash crony capitalism
[56:43.440 --> 56:47.960]  false free market, but they're trying to blame the free market in closing. Let's get a prediction
[56:47.960 --> 56:53.360]  from Ron Paul or a prime projection. Do you think he will be overall successful in becoming
[56:53.360 --> 56:58.320]  this messianic demigod? They've introduced the thing to repeal the 22nd amendment. Do
[56:58.320 --> 57:04.920]  you think in the future Obama will be successful or will liberty defeat him? I don't think
[57:04.920 --> 57:09.240]  he'll be successful. I think for a year or two or three, he's going to get away with
[57:09.240 --> 57:13.920]  a lot and there'll be a strong segment that will continue to support him. But I think
[57:13.920 --> 57:21.040]  ultimately truth wins out in the end and that's why I remain optimistic. Congressman Liberty
[57:21.040 --> 57:24.960]  committee, tell folks about some of the websites they should visit. Okay. I'd have them go
[57:24.960 --> 57:30.640]  to campaign campaign for liberty.com and join us and we are going to have meetings around
[57:30.640 --> 57:34.960]  the country and we're looking for new members and we continue to grow and we're emphasizing
[57:34.960 --> 57:39.800]  a lot of organization on college campuses. And I would add in the minute we have left,
[57:39.800 --> 57:43.560]  this is classic. They saw what you did. The Obama campaign admitted they mimicked your
[57:43.560 --> 57:49.200]  true grassroots. They did that. The media attacked you. He launched ahead. He won. And
[57:49.200 --> 57:53.760]  so that shows how important a true grassroots movement under liberty and individualism is
[57:53.760 --> 57:56.720]  to counter their collectivist movement. Do you agree?
[57:56.720 --> 58:03.160]  Oh, absolutely. And that's the only way it should be. And I feel pleased about that.
[58:03.160 --> 58:08.960]  But like I tried to simplify that, I really believe freedom is a popular issue.
[58:08.960 --> 58:15.440]  I think the thing that's going to sink him though is going after the guns. Do you agree?
[58:15.440 --> 58:19.520]  Oh, yeah. The American people aren't going to give up the guns. Can you imagine now the
[58:19.520 --> 58:23.080]  millions of people who have bought gold coins and can't even find them now realizing what's
[58:23.080 --> 58:26.240]  going on? They're not going to give up their guns and they're not going to give up their
[58:26.240 --> 58:30.440]  gold. And they say this is an opportunity for the new world order. In reality, it's
[58:30.440 --> 58:35.960]  an opportunity for freedom, isn't it? Absolutely. We should work hard. Congressman, God bless
[58:35.960 --> 58:42.600]  you. God speed. We'll talk to you soon.

[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:47.600]  I want my hey baby, there is no easy way I want my hey, I want my back down
[1:02:47.600 --> 1:03:04.600]  I want my hey baby, there is no easy way I want my hey, I will stand on my ground

[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:16.600]  I have so oversold Barack Obama as an agent of change in this country that I think if he is not able to walk on water real quick there is going to be a lot of disappointment.
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:37.600]  Ok the music indicates we are through the first break we are going to try and get our electronic systems back to battery over this next break and we will be right back.
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:46.600]  Have you ever thought about what is in your shampoo, soap or detergent, how about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more.
[1:04:46.600 --> 1:04:52.600]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4000 separate ingredients most of which are synthetic.
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:05:03.600]  Hi this is Alex Jones I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes.

[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:44.600]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:48.600]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:05:48.600 --> 1:05:49.600]  Bin Laden.
[1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:50.600]  This is his MO.
[1:05:50.600 --> 1:05:53.600]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:05:53.600 --> 1:06:00.600]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:00.600 --> 1:06:07.600]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:06:07.600 --> 1:06:11.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:21.600]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much, much more.
[1:06:21.600 --> 1:06:30.600]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:34.600]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:06:44.600 --> 1:06:45.600]  The time clock is ticking.
[1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:47.600]  Laws could change.
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:49.600]  The New World Order is advancing rapidly.
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:52.600]  Health Consciousness is fading away.
[1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:57.600]  Junk food, fast food, fat food is the New World Order's game.
[1:06:57.600 --> 1:06:59.600]  Don't play the game.
[1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:06.600]  Slim down, detox and cleanse yourself from the chemical foods and processed food that we intake daily.
[1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:08.600]  And now for the holiday special.
[1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:11.600]  Buy one month of super tea and we'll throw in an extra two weeks.
[1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:15.600]  That's right, one month of super tea and we'll throw in an extra two weeks.
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:17.600]  It won't last long, so order now.
[1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:19.600]  Get the tea dot com.
[1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:22.600]  That's get the tea dot com.
[1:07:22.600 --> 1:07:27.600]  Or call us at 928-308-0408.
[1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:32.600]  That's 928-308-0408.
[1:07:32.600 --> 1:08:00.600]  Order now before you can't.
[1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:05.600]  Well, I'm afraid that this is live from Oahu, and this is Michael Riverao,
[1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:09.600]  and normally I guess hosts my own show, WhatReallyHappened.com.
[1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:11.600]  Alex is out doing what Alex does best.
[1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:15.600]  He's out there shaking the world through its foundations and getting some new information
[1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:19.600]  that's going to be very important for all of us to be looking at as we head into 2009.
[1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:23.600]  Getting back to the Barack Obama inauguration.
[1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:29.600]  And it is, as I said before, it's a great spectacle, a Roman spectacle, if you will.
[1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:31.600]  And it is a hard sell.
[1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:35.600]  They're really trying to get out the message that things are going to change,
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:36.600]  things are going to be better.
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:40.600]  And Barack Obama does have one very important advantage,
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:44.600]  and that is he is the successor to George W. Bush,
[1:08:44.600 --> 1:08:48.600]  arguably the worst president in the history of the entire nation.
[1:08:48.600 --> 1:08:53.600]  And so all Barack Obama has to do is absolutely nothing,
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:56.600]  and he's still going to be seen as an improvement.
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:09:00.600]  And the biggest challenge our country is facing right now is the economy,
[1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:05.600]  and that obviously very firmly falls onto the shoulders of the preceding administration,
[1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:09.600]  so Barack Obama is going to get a free pass on that.
[1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:12.600]  He can either make it better and take credit for that,
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:17.600]  or it's just going to continue to get worse, and the preceding administration gets that.
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:19.600]  So Barack's got that advantage going for him.
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:25.600]  And maybe they should have been a little bit more muted on selling him
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:27.600]  as this savior of the nation,
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:30.600]  because now the expectation is very high.
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:32.600]  And as I was saying before the break,
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:35.600]  I mean watching the faces of the people along the parade room
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:37.600]  when they were driving the cameras and everything by,
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:43.600]  it was like such ecstatic joy and religious fervor on their face,
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:47.600]  and I'm almost ready for them to start handing the loaves and fishes to Barack
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:49.600]  so he can feed everybody their lunch today.
[1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:54.600]  And seriously, if he doesn't do something really spectacular real quick,
[1:09:54.600 --> 1:10:01.600]  real positive, I think that expectation is going to come back to haunt him.
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:05.600]  And certainly I know a lot of people here in the Alex Jones audience.
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:11.600]  They were less than 100% ecstatic about Barack Obama.
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:14.600]  Now, I wanted Ron Paul.
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:19.600]  I was very disappointed when as somebody who talked about real,
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:21.600]  significant change in the country,
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:26.600]  he was very quickly shown the door by the American media and the political establishment.
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:29.600]  So we were left with the choice of the lesser of two evils,
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:31.600]  and I'll be very honest.
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:36.600]  I was just delighted that Obama managed to keep Hillary out of the nomination
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:40.600]  because I am still convinced that the original plan
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:44.600]  by those who shape our nation from behind the scenes
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:49.600]  was for John McCain to lose to Hillary Clinton.
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:52.600]  And then when Hillary lost to Obama,
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:54.600]  I think it took a lot of people by surprise.
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:58.600]  But now he is the president for good, bad, or indifferent.
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:04.600]  He has a cabinet which really looks like a revival of the Clinton administration
[1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:05.600]  for the most part.
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:08.600]  We have Hillary as the secretary of state.
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:11.600]  And so to be very honest, on the one hand,
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:16.600]  it may be that Barack Obama is already walled off to such an extent
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:20.600]  that as a president, he may not be able to affect much change at all.
[1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:24.600]  On the other hand, and let's wait until we see what he's going to do,
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:26.600]  he may turn out to be another Lyndon Johnson.
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:28.600]  And I've mentioned this before,
[1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:32.600]  but just recapping since yesterday was Martin Luther King Day.
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:36.600]  When Lyndon Johnson became president and Dr. Martin Luther King
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:41.600]  started really uniting people in the cause of civil rights,
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:43.600]  it was Lyndon Johnson who stood up and said,
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:46.600]  OK, segregation is wrong.
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:48.600]  We are going to desegregate the schools.
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:50.600]  We are going to send the National Guard if I have to
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:52.600]  to see that this happens peacefully.
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:56.600]  And Dr. Martin Luther King, when he finally met President Johnson,
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:58.600]  said, you know, I'm Mr. President.
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:02.600]  I am grateful and gratified for your support in this cause.
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:06.600]  But it is such a contrast to some of your previous speeches.
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:09.600]  And Lyndon Johnson said, well, back then I was campaigning.
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:11.600]  And now I've got the job.
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:14.600]  You know that old Negro spiritual, free at last, free at last.
[1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:16.600]  Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:21.600]  So there's a possibility that Barack Obama,
[1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:23.600]  now that he's got the job,
[1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:27.600]  and if you think about it really, his political career is over.
[1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:28.600]  He's the president.
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:30.600]  He's got one more election in four years.
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:33.600]  And after that, there's nothing left for him to do.
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:36.600]  So in terms of political ambition,
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:38.600]  there's no way left for him to go.
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:41.600]  He's got the job, now he's going to do it.
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:44.600]  He may prove to be very much like John Kennedy.
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:46.600]  I know a lot of people make a lot of illusions
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:48.600]  between Obama and Kennedy.
[1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:50.600]  Kennedy was notorious.
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:53.600]  Once he got into office,
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:58.600]  he basically abandoned a lot of his supporters
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:03.600]  in groups like organized crime to say,
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  okay, I'm going to be the president of the United States
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:08.600]  and I'm going to do things I think are best for the nation as a whole.
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:10.600]  And that created a great deal of anger,
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:13.600]  but that was one of the reasons why John F. Kennedy
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:15.600]  was such a popular president.
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:17.600]  He was not perfect.
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:20.600]  He was not a saint by any stretch of the imagination.
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:23.600]  If you remember the whole Marilyn Monroe thing, among others.
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:26.600]  But he did try and execute some changes
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:28.600]  contrary to the wishes of his supporters.
[1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:31.600]  We might see that from Barack Obama.
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:32.600]  We might not.
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:35.600]  Time alone will solve that mystery.
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:38.600]  And I know there's a lot of emails and a lot of calls
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:40.600]  and a lot of stuff going out there about saying,
[1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:42.600]  oh, Obama's just doing a terrible, terrible job.
[1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:44.600]  He's going to be this, he's going to be that.
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:47.600]  And he's sold out to these interests.
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:50.600]  And it's all attempts at precognition.
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:52.600]  We don't really know.
[1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:54.600]  He's only just gotten the job a couple of hours ago.
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:56.600]  It's going to be all parties today.
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:13:59.600]  I think we just need to sort of sit and watch
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:01.600]  and see what the guy does.
[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:04.600]  And he may turn out to really be thinking about
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:06.600]  the welfare of the whole country
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:08.600]  because in a lot of ways he really is an outsider
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:10.600]  to the political establishment.
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  And he's a very smart individual
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:15.600]  and he may be smart enough to realize
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:19.600]  that if we don't take care of the country as a whole right now
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:22.600]  that even the special interest people are going to suffer.
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:26.600]  And that is a wisdom that a lot of our economic leaders
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:28.600]  are very much lacking in.
[1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:31.600]  They go back to Adam Smith.
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:34.600]  They love his philosophy because it justifies
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:36.600]  a great deal of personal greed.
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:40.600]  And John Nash, of course, proved that Adam Smith
[1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:43.600]  was not accurate, that really wise leadership
[1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:47.600]  looks at the whole system along, together with
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:50.600]  their self-interest in order to move society forward.
[1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:53.600]  But again, we don't know what he's going to do.
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:56.600]  He may be very sincere about wanting to do well for the country.
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:59.600]  He may just be another in a long line of presidential con artists
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:02.600]  that we have been suckered into supporting.
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:06.600]  I don't think he was the intended plan for a president,
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:10.600]  but he is a professional politician, so we will see.
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:13.600]  Now, obviously, as we get a little bit further into the show here,
[1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:16.600]  I want to go back and do a quick recap
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:19.600]  on this Israel and Gaza situation.
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:21.600]  And by the way, if you want to call into the show,
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:25.600]  our number is 800-259-9231.
[1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:27.600]  Same number that you call to get onto my show.
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:29.600]  800-259-9231.
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:33.600]  And when you call in and just say hi to our technicians
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:35.600]  who are doing yeoman's service today,
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:38.600]  apparently they're dealing with a lot of really, really bad
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:43.600]  technical glitches today because of all that's going on.
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:45.600]  So call in and say hi to them.
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:49.600]  Now, getting onto the situation with Gaza.
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:52.600]  We've only got a few minutes until the break here.
[1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:55.600]  This last weekend, Israel declared a ceasefire
[1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:58.600]  and said, we're going to keep our troops in place.
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:01.600]  Hamas then said, we declare a ceasefire to give you time to get out.
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:05.600]  And a lot of people said this ceasefire offer from Israel
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:08.600]  was intended to be broken because if a guy breaks into your home
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:10.600]  and he kills your family and burns up your kitchen,
[1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:12.600]  then he stops you in your living room and says,
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:14.600]  I'll stop shooting at you if you stop shooting at me,
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:16.600]  but I'm going to stay in your living room.
[1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:18.600]  That's not a deal anybody would go for.
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:21.600]  Now, the latest reports that we're getting from sources on the ground in Gaza,
[1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:22.600]  two things.
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:25.600]  One, Israel is still continuing occasional aerial bombardments.
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:28.600]  This may be unofficial just from frustrated soldiers
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:31.600]  lobbing the last few phosphorus shells and whatnot.
[1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:33.600]  We are also hearing that the ground forces,
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:37.600]  Israel's ground forces are in fact being withdrawn.
[1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:39.600]  This is not officially being acknowledged.
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:42.600]  Israel doesn't want to say we're pulling out of Gaza,
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:45.600]  but apparently the ground forces are in fact leaving.
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:48.600]  So hopefully this situation is going to calm down.
[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:51.600]  Thankfully, thankfully, because of people like you
[1:16:51.600 --> 1:16:54.600]  who called your newspapers, called the radio shows,
[1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:56.600]  called your congressmen, talked to your friends,
[1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:58.600]  because of that huge public pressure,
[1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:02.600]  Israel was unable to expand the Gaza war into Lebanon,
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:07.600]  or Syria, or Jordan, or worst case, Iran.
[1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:12.600]  This latest attempt to create a regional war in the Middle East,
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:16.600]  possibly a precursor to World War III, got stopped in its tracks.
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:20.600]  And that was due to the public outcry.
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:24.600]  So you are all peacemakers, and congratulations.
[1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:27.600]  You can count coup on this one, definitely.
[1:17:27.600 --> 1:17:29.600]  Now, looking at the economy here,
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:31.600]  we got a couple more minutes before the break.
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:34.600]  I just wanted to note that apparently Wall Street
[1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:38.600]  is a little bit less enthusiastic about Barack Obama
[1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:41.600]  than some other people, because the stock market,
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:45.600]  the Dow is down about 180 points right now.
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:49.600]  And I remember back when George Bush was sworn in,
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:51.600]  the stock market just had a field day.
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:54.600]  They just went way, way, way up into the stratosphere,
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:56.600]  and everybody was cheering.
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:58.600]  The economy is going to be wonderful,
[1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:00.600]  and we're all going to be rich.
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:02.600]  And for a while, it looked like it was working
[1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:05.600]  until we began to realize that almost all of the economic progress
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:08.600]  over the last few years has been creative bookkeeping,
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:10.600]  to put it politely, or pyramid schemes,
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:14.600]  to call it less politely, that did not bring new money
[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:15.600]  into the system.
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:17.600]  It simply moved the debt around and concealed it
[1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:21.600]  and papered it over with more paper fiat currency.
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:25.600]  And this is probably the biggest single crisis
[1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:27.600]  that Barack Obama is inheriting
[1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:29.600]  from the previous administration,
[1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:32.600]  is an economy that is in dire, dire trouble
[1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:36.600]  and no real easy quick solutions on the horizon
[1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:38.600]  that he can take advantage of.
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:43.600]  And Biden and some other people were talking about
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:46.600]  having to make some very unpopular decisions,
[1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:49.600]  and I think we know what some of those decisions might be
[1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:51.600]  and why in the long run,
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:53.600]  I don't think they're going to be workable.
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:56.600]  So I want you to put on your thinking caps.
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:19:00.600]  I know we're all watching President Bush say goodbye
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:03.600]  and head on off to wherever he's going to head off to,
[1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:07.600]  and Barack Obama is heading over to start his day on the job here.
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:09.600]  But he's facing a lot of challenges,
[1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:11.600]  and I'd like to hear what your opinions
[1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:14.600]  and challenges are as soon as we come back
[1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:17.600]  from this break for words from our sponsors.
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:42.600]  3, 2, 1!

[1:19:49.600 --> 1:19:52.600]  Would you like to keep at least one of those resolutions this year?
[1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:55.600]  Well, right now, success is one click away.

[1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:47.600]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:47.600 --> 1:20:50.600]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:53.600]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:53.600 --> 1:20:56.600]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:20:59.600]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:06.600]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:08.600]  For the first time in history,
[1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:12.600]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:16.600]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:18.600]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:20.600]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:21.600]  They have all the money they need.
[1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:22.600]  They're after power.

[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:38.600]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[1:21:38.600 --> 1:21:41.600]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:43.600]  and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:45.600]  Therefore, with catastrophic events,
[1:21:45.600 --> 1:21:48.600]  it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits
[1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:51.600]  on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:57.600]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:00.600]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:04.600]  to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:06.600]  A current effort is underway by the Fed,
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:10.600]  along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:15.600]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:17.600]  In order to achieve strength and stability,
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:23.600]  I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:26.600]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:29.600]  gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:33.600]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:37.600]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:38.600]  Attention.
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:41.600]  This is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:45.600]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food,
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:48.600]  this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[1:22:48.600 --> 1:22:49.600]  Here is why.
[1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:52.600]  This network has just learned of a new video course
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:56.600]  that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods
[1:22:56.600 --> 1:23:00.600]  in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:03.600]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:06.600]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S. this fall?
[1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:07.600]  Don't wait.
[1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:11.600]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:14.600]  Get the details at FoodShortageUSA.com.
[1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:16.600]  That's FoodShortageUSA.com.

[1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:49.600]  Okay.
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:50.600]  All right.
[1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:51.600]  And here we are.
[1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:52.600]  Welcome back to the show.
[1:23:52.600 --> 1:23:54.600]  Here I didn't even recognize the bump music.
[1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:58.600]  You know, there's an old saying that if you can't taste things,
[1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:00.600]  it's nice about somebody don't say anything at all.
[1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:04.600]  And I guess they're following that dictum over at MSNBC
[1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:09.600]  because I was watching during the coverage of President and his former president,
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:14.600]  thankfully, getting onto the helicopter at Andrews Air Force Base.
[1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:20.600]  And the commentators are talking about whether hats are coming back into fashion for men or not.
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:27.600]  And I guess they are that desperate not to say anything negative about the worst president in the history of the country.
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:29.600]  Now, a quick note before we go any further here.
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:36.600]  I've just been informed that Alex Jones will be joining the broadcast here and taking over brains here at the microphone
[1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:38.600]  at the bottom of the hour after this break.
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:44.600]  So we'll be glad to have Alex here and telling us what the latest is that he has got for us.
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:47.600]  Meanwhile, as I mentioned before, we went to the slum to be great.
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:54.600]  The biggest challenge that the new president is facing is the economy.
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  And second, we're getting some more technical difficulties.
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:06.600]  The biggest challenge Barack Obama is facing is the economy.
[1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:11.600]  And it is one that does not have an easy fit.
[1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:22.600]  And partly because the Federal Reserve has flooded the country with so much paper money to make up for the money that was owed before,
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:25.600]  that the whole system is really becoming very, very fragile.
[1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:28.600]  And here's in a nutshell where the problem comes from.
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:35.600]  When you have a debt-based economy, that is when money is created, the instant people borrow it,
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:40.600]  then more money is always owed and actually in existence.
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:48.600]  And as long as you have a new generation, the larger generation of borrowers coming along
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:54.600]  to borrow more money to create more money to pay back to the people who were there first,
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:56.600]  it'll keep the point.
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:59.600]  It's functionally, it is a pyramid scheme.
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:05.600]  When you reach a point where there's no new borrowers at the bottom of this pyramid,
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:07.600]  that's when it starts to collapse.
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:14.600]  So what the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government has been doing is they are borrowing on your behalf,
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:20.600]  without your permission.
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:27.600]  They are creating ostensibly to be repaid down the road by you and your children and your great-grandchildren.
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:34.600]  And they're borrowing that money on your behalf so that they can print out new money to give to the existing financial systems
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:36.600]  that are in trouble, the bailouts.
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:43.600]  And the reason they're not really all that careful about where the money is being spent is because where it's being spent
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:45.600]  isn't the issue.
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:54.600]  It is simply creating new money to make up the shortfall to be able to pay the interest that has accumulated on the earlier loans
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:56.600]  and stick you with the bills.
[1:26:56.600 --> 1:26:58.600]  And that's really it in a nutshell.
[1:26:58.600 --> 1:27:02.600]  So what is the situation that Barack Obama is facing?
[1:27:02.600 --> 1:27:07.600]  Basically, new money must come into this country from some source.
[1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:12.600]  I know a lot of people are saying, abolish the Federal Reserve, I would agree with that, I don't think it's going to happen.
[1:27:12.600 --> 1:27:15.600]  It's going to have a complete collapse of the U.S. government, which may happen.
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:16.600]  Sooner or later, it does happen.
[1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:18.600]  It happened to the USSR.
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:23.600]  But until then, Barack Obama's got to bring new money into the U.S. economy.
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:29.600]  The way that you traditionally do that, short of conquering the rest of the world and having them send you tribute,
[1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:35.600]  is you've got to invest in creating new technology, new industry, and new products.
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:37.600]  We have lost our manufacturing.
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:39.600]  We can't play catch-up.
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:47.600]  We've got to invent new products that only the United States knows how to make that the rest of the world wants to buy.
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:52.600]  Just by doing that, whether it's through a new space program expansion like we did in the 60s,
[1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:57.600]  or a Manhattan-type project for civilian science, or the way the Japanese do it,
[1:27:57.600 --> 1:28:02.600]  with their tremendous funding for the fifth-generation computer project, robotics,
[1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:08.600]  we need to create something that only the United States knows how to make and sell it to the rest of the world.
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:14.600]  And then money will come back into the country, and we can pull our economy out of the doldrums.
[1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:18.600]  And that really is the only real way to make it happen.
[1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:23.600]  Everything else is just fancy bookkeeping, playing musical chairs with the debt.
[1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:30.600]  They're just pushing the debt from the people with political influence onto the people who don't have political influence.
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:39.600]  That is, yes.
[1:29:00.600 --> 1:29:15.600]  We're going to have open phones, as Mike was saying, and get Mike's take on what we're seeing out of the Obama administration,
[1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:20.600]  now about an hour into being inaugurated, the 44th president.
[1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:23.600]  So that is coming up at PrisonPlanet.tv with the live streams.
[1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:28.600]  We are live there and on the AM and FM dial with the radio listeners. Stay with us.
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:32.600]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:39.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:44.600]  Gentlemen, I know you need no reminder that Valentine's Day is right around the corner.
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:46.600]  Obviously you have the perfect gift in mind.

[1:30:33.600 --> 1:30:38.600]  That's 702-453-7455.
[1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:45.600]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:49.600]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:51.600]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:54.600]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:30:54.600 --> 1:31:01.600]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:08.600]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:31:08.600 --> 1:31:12.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:19.600]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network,
[1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:23.600]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[1:31:23.600 --> 1:31:31.600]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:31:31.600 --> 1:31:38.600]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:31:38.600 --> 1:31:42.600]  Everyone knows that Omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:47.600]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[1:31:47.600 --> 1:31:51.600]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[1:31:51.600 --> 1:31:54.600]  Nature's Gem. Premium Omega-3.
[1:31:54.600 --> 1:32:01.600]  Unlike other flax seed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours,
[1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:05.600]  producing the highest quality premium golden flax seed around.
[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:14.600]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flax seeds by size and weight, keeping only the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of Omega-3.
[1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:19.600]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor. Nature's Gem golden flax is pure.
[1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:23.600]  There is nothing added and nothing taken away and non-GMO.

[1:33:00.600 --> 1:33:06.600]  And now, after it has turned into just absolute worship, they're closing Guantanamo.
[1:33:06.600 --> 1:33:10.600]  They're moving it to secret bases in the United States, ABC News.
[1:33:10.600 --> 1:33:17.600]  They are going to have a new banker bailout, tens of trillions more, even more power, a new bank of the United States that's private.
[1:33:17.600 --> 1:33:21.600]  Literally taking into receivership most of the major corporations and banks.
[1:33:21.600 --> 1:33:27.600]  This is like the oligarchs in Russia in the mid-1990s looting it. Same thing is happening.
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:32.600]  Of course, you know, George Bush had to be repudiated. We knew he was evil. We knew he was a puppet.
[1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:35.600]  But the same advisors, the same elites are behind Obama.
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:45.600]  Mike Rivera, I mean, they've now got not just the 18 to 24, three months a year service to begin with
[1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:51.600]  in paramilitary training, a civilian defense force, quote, as big and strong as the U.S. military, a million strong.
[1:33:51.600 --> 1:33:57.600]  Now they've announced, and a few hundred thousand members in a week, USAService.org,
[1:33:57.600 --> 1:34:04.600]  a separate classical fascist organization controlled by Obama himself that plans to get millions of volunteers.
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:09.600]  Clinton tried this and it failed. He is succeeding because the media is acting like he's God.
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:17.600]  And it has a lot of reasonable things like soup kitchens and, again, opening up to make it sound reasonable to get good people involved.
[1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  And then they're admitting it's going to be environmental brigades. They're going to people all the other forces they're going to build
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:34.600]  in government out of that giant pool. I mean, this is classic body snatcher level tyranny. I mean, your analysis of that.
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:40.600]  Well, the popular with all these celebrities that was on the net all day yesterday, and I put it on my website,
[1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:47.600]  and I paired it with one of the Lenny Riefenstahl propaganda videos from the heat. He just lined up there and said,
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:53.600]  yes, we will be there for Germany. And it ultimately, first of all...
[1:34:53.600 --> 1:35:00.600]  Mike, Mike, Mike, your connection from Hawaii is cutting out. We're going to go back to you in just a few minutes.
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:07.600]  Speaking of the devil, I sent the clip to the network out of habit, but we're doing the most of the network operations here ourselves.
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:16.600]  John, will you, I am, to my control room, that particular first clip I sent you today so we can put it up and play it here,
[1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:24.600]  where the celebrities say, we will do whatever you say, we will submit to you, we will do whatever you say.
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:30.600]  Because the media is saying in unison, do what Obama says and he can fix it, but they never say what that is specifically,
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:35.600]  but in the fine print it's total tyranny. And they kept saying that in the speeches today.
[1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:39.600]  I was watching some of the speeches during the breaks and it was just, things will get better, they're going to get worse first,
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:43.600]  just do what we say, there's some things we're going to need you to do, this isn't going to be comfortable.
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:48.600]  I mean, this is scary. This is out of control. Do we have Mike back?
[1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:50.600]  OK, testing one, two, three, one, two, three.
[1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:57.600]  OK, good. Yeah, we've got you on air, sir. So specifically, though, continue with this Hollywood video they're putting out,
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:00.600]  where they're saying, we will do whatever you say. Go ahead.
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:06.600]  Yeah, basically, it's this video of all these celebrities that are standing up there saying, I pledge, I will do X, Y, Z.
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:13.600]  And over and over and over again, it's just hammering this whole point of pledging to support the president.
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:17.600]  I have no problem with volunteerism, my wife and I are involved in several charities here locally.
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:24.600]  But the problem with this is, that we're meant to volunteer.
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:27.600]  OK, Mike, again, we're going to have to cut it off there.
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:33.600]  Let's just totally reconnect with Mike. OK, thank you. Again, we're audio and video, so there's a few problems from Hawaii.
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:39.600]  Yes, what he's saying is, they come out and in their real documents, and in some of their speeches they say,
[1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:47.600]  forced youth brigades, environmental corps, senior corps, 18 to 24, you must serve in paramilitary training,
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:57.600]  Ramamanual, Rock Obama Hall and Record. Then separately, which is what Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin and Mao did, they create their own individual corps outside government.
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:02.600]  That's the largest pool. And so to open up the salvo, they don't say, oh, it's to tattle on your neighbors, it's to spy,
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:06.600]  it's to go spy on farmers and ranchers and dig up dirt to try to steal their farms.
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:10.600]  That's what they're really setting up in the training, that the federal government's been beta testing for decades,
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:13.600]  that we've been covering in my first films cover it.
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:19.600]  And so then what they do is, they say, oh, it's soup kitchens, it's cleaning up the park, it's cleaning up the lake,
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:23.600]  and people go, man, that sounds reasonable, the government's asking for my help.
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:28.600]  Meanwhile, they're stealing trillions, setting up police state building camps, bringing troops in.
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:34.600]  So all that's going on, but it's this feel good thing, and then Obama becomes the symbol of taking old ladies across the street,
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:37.600]  or taking old people to the store to get some food.
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:41.600]  You know, it's the same thing with local cops, where we take a family shopping for Christmas.
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:47.600]  Local cop means well, he thinks he's doing a good job, but it's PR for all the taserings and the shootings in the back
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:49.600]  and the checkpoints and the beatdowns.
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:57.600]  It's propaganda making all of the charity, all of it about the government and about how good Barack Obama is,
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:01.600]  and then out of that giant pool that they launch in the name of helping old people in soup kitchens,
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:09.600]  they admit that they are going to people all of their governmental brigades and then separate fascist brigades.
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:15.600]  So absolutely, while we're getting a better connection to Hawaii from Mike Rivera, WhatReallyHappened.com,
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:18.600]  I just briefly want to tell the list or something.
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:23.600]  I have had such a serious feeling of concern in my heart, my intellect, my soul.
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:31.600]  I have been so fired up and so focused that I haven't even been talking about really lately supporting this radio show and what we do here.
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:39.600]  And the costs are just absolutely huge to have three people in there running a live TV show and radio show.
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  I have to pay those guys, the great guys, to be trying to hire an extra web person and another IT person who we're all interviewing right now
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:51.600]  because we don't have the personnel.
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  That's why InfoWars.com and PrismPlanet.com are down maybe 30, 40 minutes an hour a day off and on.
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:00.600]  It is a nightmare because we don't have the money.
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:08.600]  We have two CDNs and a couple other servers and we don't have the money to get the new CDN, an extra one we need to fix these problems.
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  We've hired consultants.
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:12.600]  This is all extremely expensive.
[1:39:12.600 --> 1:39:21.600]  We're getting millions of visits a day, but the majority of them, 99.9% are buying nothing.
[1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:25.600]  And I understand that's because the society is breaking down.
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:27.600]  I understand it's because the economy is in shambles.
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:36.600]  We are taking the gamble, the risk under this maximum threat to the Republic and the attack on the Second Amendment and free speech and everything that's going to intensify under Obama.
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:38.600]  It's going to get worse.
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:45.600]  It would have gotten worse under McCain because they're just frontmen for the same agenda that rolls forward.
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:47.600]  We need your financial support.
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:40:02.600]  And the way I ask listeners to do that, plus you get great videos and books, is go to Infowars.com and buy Endgame, buy Terrorist, or buy Truth Rising, fabled enemies, the books and videos, the money masters about who the banking elite are, incredibly riveting.
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:12.600]  All these books and materials, if we just go there and see it as a donation to liberty and freedom, we can continue because things have gotten so bad.
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:20.600]  I mean, across the board that, you know, I made the decision a year and a half ago to get a bigger office and to move and expand.
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:25.600]  And looking at our finances, then it looked like that it even held where it was.
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:27.600]  It was a big growth curve.
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:29.600]  And of course, our listenership and viewership is way off the charts.
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:30.600]  It just continues to explode.
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:35.600]  But the amount of people that are able to support or buy books and videos is down.
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:38.600]  And so we need your financial support.
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:41.600]  We need those of you that have the capital to support us.
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:45.600]  We need those that have supported us because I made the decision a year and a half ago.
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:58.600]  But on top of doing radio every day, doing TV, doing films, infrastructure, interviews, all the things I have, it took a good year and three or four months to get moved over here in the last two months.
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:06.600]  Then we had to, from scratch, on the cheap, build the studio, do it as best we could, but still at great expense to us.
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:14.600]  I'm trying to finish the other TV studio out there and I see the economy just plunging and every one of our capital centers plunging.
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:20.600]  And I don't want to turn this into a giant infomercial with products and things that I believe in, but still I want to cover the news.
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:23.600]  So it's just better if people just support us.
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:34.600]  And if you want to just write a donation to Alex Jones and mail it to 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04, that will be spent on fighting the New World Order.
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:40.600]  And that will be spent on hiring more people and not just staying the same or getting smaller, but growing.
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:45.600]  We have a big nut to crack each month and I just haven't spent enough time on this.
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:55.600]  So go to infowars.com, go through the shopping cart, call the toll free number, tell them what's a good combo, what's a good special, and get a great book, a great video, or if you got the money, buy 100 videos.
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:58.600]  We've got them as low as $5.95, you buy a bunch of them in bulk.
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:01.600]  Buy them, give them to people, or if you can only buy one, buy it and make copies.
[1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:04.600]  The key here to getting my films is getting them out to people.
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  So that's how you donate is you go to infowars.com or you call toll free 888-253-3139.
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:13.600]  888-253-3139.
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:16.600]  I'll tell you what else this radio show does.
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:29.600]  We bring you all these other activists and leaders and scientists and researchers and authors and filmmakers who are not getting support and they respond that they get record support when they come on this show.
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:33.600]  So we're also energizing the activist community, energizing the Republic.
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:36.600]  I got an email last night and I really know it's true.
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:38.600]  You know, the guy said, Alex, you got to get more on the NAS.
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:41.600]  They're taking over the food supply, the premises ID, the total takeover.
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:43.600]  You got to get more on the Second Amendment attack.
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:46.600]  I know I covered a little every day, but it's so big, it's so real.
[1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:51.600]  Alex, you're probably not only one of the big dogs in the fight, you're probably the only dog in the fight.
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:54.600]  And at this level, we're it, and we're not that big.
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:59.600]  We're the biggest, the best, the most focused, and it is rag tag, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:01.600]  It is rag tag.
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:08.600]  And I talked to consultants and IT people who are very expensive every hour.
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:12.600]  And they told us, you need these type of CDNs.
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:13.600]  You need this configuration.
[1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:14.600]  You need this package.
[1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:15.600]  You need these people.
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:19.600]  And we don't have the money to do it.
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:23.600]  I have limited reserves so we can operate in an emergency for a few months.
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:29.600]  So I can't commit those reserves to UpgradeInfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:32.600]  So they'll be 10 times more effective.
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:36.600]  And so, you know, five, six years ago, and we're going to go to Mike in a second.
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:38.600]  We just got him back.
[1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:42.600]  Five, 10 years ago, you know, I was small.
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:44.600]  Two or three people worked with me.
[1:43:44.600 --> 1:43:45.600]  I even did my own camera work.
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:46.600]  I didn't want to grow.
[1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:47.600]  I didn't like having employees.
[1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:48.600]  I don't like management.
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:50.600]  I don't like having to organize all this.
[1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:53.600]  It was enough to just do a radio show every day and make films and have a little website
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:55.600]  that my wife and I updated.
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:43:57.600]  I grew from that.
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:00.600]  And then I had to learn to try to make money to pay the people.
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:04.600]  And then more and more, as we made more capital, I put it back in and then things grew.
[1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:07.600]  And then the economy's imploding.
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  So just to continue what we're doing at this level, we need massive support.
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:17.600]  And to grow, if people want to donate large sums, and I know people have them out there,
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:23.600]  it will 100% go to this operation.
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:25.600]  We need those donations.
[1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:26.600]  We need the support.
[1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:35.600]  And again, whether it's a $5 ball cap or a $15, a $10 video, go to infowars.com or call 888-2533139
[1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:36.600]  or write us a check.
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:37.600]  Send us FRNs.
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:43.600]  I don't care because I let the enemy intimidate me a decade ago, 12 years ago, to never ask
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:47.600]  for money, to never get support, to almost be ashamed of selling my videos and saying
[1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:51.600]  make copies because I want to get the word out and then never being able to grow.
[1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:54.600]  And then I learned in the last five years, hey, go ahead and ask for support.
[1:44:54.600 --> 1:44:58.600]  And that allowed us to do things that made us reach 10, 20, 30 times.
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:44:59.600]  And now it's exponential.
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:04.600]  We got rock stars, top rap stars, one of the founders of hip-hop, calling us up wanting
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:05.600]  to come on the show.
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:11.600]  I find out from people that almost every major Hollywood TV production show, our fans of it,
[1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:14.600]  major Hollywood stars call me all the time but don't want to go on air because they're
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:15.600]  scared, huge support.
[1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:19.600]  And I haven't learned how to get on the phone and say, okay, give me some money then.
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:23.600]  I got people showing up saying I want to give you a $20,000 check and I say no, no, no,
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:24.600]  no, no.
[1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:29.600]  Or I get the check and then I have a $14,000 prize thing for videos about net neutrality
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:33.600]  to expose what's happening with the attack on the web instead of keeping that money to
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:34.600]  fund the operation.
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:37.600]  Well, I'm not ashamed of asking for money and there's nothing wrong with it.
[1:45:37.600 --> 1:45:39.600]  The government's using our money to destroy us.
[1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:44.600]  They've stolen $8.5 trillion we know of and yes, we need your support because I realize
[1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:47.600]  how big this threat is and I'm going to bust my butt.
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:50.600]  I was up till two in the morning last night doing an almost hour-long audio blog.
[1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:52.600]  I'm going to turn the heat up.
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:55.600]  I'm going to do five-minute news blitzes on video every day.
[1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:56.600]  We're starting a bunch of new stuff.
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:59.600]  We're going to announce the new month and I'm just going to gamble it all and gamble
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:00.600]  our reserves and I don't care.
[1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:02.600]  I'm going to go ahead and launch to the next level.
[1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:06.600]  I'm not letting it stop us and I'm going to start that new national TV show and we're
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:07.600]  going to do it all.
[1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:12.600]  I'll run this son of a bitch in the ground if I have to because I'm going to go 110%
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:15.600]  against these people and I'm asking you for your help in this fight.
[1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:19.600]  I need it and I am committed to this fight against the new world order and the dirty
[1:46:19.600 --> 1:46:23.600]  tricks and the attacks and everything we go under is so incredible.
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:26.600]  Again, it's good to ask for support and I'm asking for your support.
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:28.600]  We've proven we're fighting like nobody else.
[1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:31.600]  We've proven with the resources, more bang for the buck than anything anybody could
[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:35.600]  imagine because of you out there spreading the word and that's how you can donate to
[1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:38.600]  you. Spread the word about Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.com, PrismPlanet.tv.
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:42.600]  If you had a membership to PrismPlanet.tv, renew it.
[1:46:42.600 --> 1:46:45.600]  Spread the word about the free podcast every day which ain't free for us.
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:49.600]  It's up to about seven grand a month to serve it out to 125,000 people free a day.
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:52.600]  We need your support and people bitch about the commercials.
[1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:53.600]  What am I supposed to do?
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:55.600]  How am I supposed to fund this?
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:46:56.600]  How am I supposed to do this?
[1:46:56.600 --> 1:46:58.600]  How am I supposed to defend the Republic?
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:02.600]  All I want to do is cover the news and make films and fight these bastards instead of having
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:09.600]  to spend my time grubbing around for the capital but to put the fuel in this Info War tank's gas tank.
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:11.600]  I want to attack enemies.
[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:12.600]  Give me the ammo.
[1:47:12.600 --> 1:47:13.600]  Give me the fuel.
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:17.600]  I will do it and that's Federal Reserve Notes while they've still got some value.
[1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:23.600]  So write to me at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:25.600]  If you want to support us that way as well.
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:27.600]  All right, Mike Rivera, I just did a five minute rant.
[1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:31.600]  I just want to thank you for filling in today when I had to do the Russia Today situation.
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:34.600]  I want to thank my crew and everybody else and people should support whatreallyhappened.com
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:35.600]  as well.
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:40.600]  I'm here ranting and raving because I realize how dire the straights are and how serious
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:44.600]  all of this is and I realize how many people we are reaching right now.
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:46.600]  It's huge but it could go to the next level.
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:51.600]  We have a chance of winning this thing and I realize my unique place in reaching millions of people,
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:53.600]  the incredible responsibility of it.
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:56.600]  I mean, do you understand the angst I'm having here?
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:00.600]  Oh, I understand exactly what you're saying and I feel the same way myself quite often.
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:02.600]  It's very hard to be trying to do it.
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:07.600]  The big money is all behind the liars and the people who want to steal the country
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:11.600]  and propaganda into going along with the New World Order.
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:15.600]  The only way we're going to get the big money out of politics is for the little money
[1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:20.600]  to all band together and support and focus on getting the truth out there.
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:21.600]  You've convinced me.
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:23.600]  I'm going to send you a check this afternoon.
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:26.600]  I understand exactly where you're coming from.
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:33.600]  I hope the people listening will take a time to realize that this is not something that people do for free.
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:36.600]  It costs a lot of money to run this over here or what really happened.
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:38.600]  Most of our computers are pulled out of trash cans.
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:41.600]  That's how much on the edge we are to keep our system running.
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:43.600]  People throw away a computer.
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:47.600]  We'll grab it and fix it and put it into the cluster to run what we're doing over here.
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:51.600]  You work doing special effects but you also do local commercials.
[1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:52.600]  You're working all the time.
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:55.600]  You've only got a few people you work with, mainly your family.
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:48:58.600]  Again, you need more support.
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:06.600]  You could do so much more if you had more support but you know what computers and even cheap prosumer cameras cost.
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:08.600]  You know what a light bill cost.
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:10.600]  You know what a server bill cost.
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:12.600]  You know what it's like to deal with all of this.
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:16.600]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, look, I know we can do big things.
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:18.600]  I know we're having a huge effect.
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:25.600]  That's why I'm getting past my allergy against asking for support and I'm saying I'm wrong.
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:26.600]  I'm bad.
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:29.600]  I apologize for not asking for more support.
[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:35.600]  Well, you do have to do that because especially in this economy people, they don't have a lot of money.
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:39.600]  They need to realize that if they want this access to the truth,
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:43.600]  if they want to get this alternative view to what's coming off from the corporate media,
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:46.600]  they have to fund that corporation themselves.
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:48.600]  Again, it gets back to the issue.
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.600]  The big money is all on the side of the liars.
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:52.600]  The little money has to stand up and be counted.
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:54.600]  And it's a dollar each, ten dollars each.
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:57.600]  I mean, you know, every little bit from everybody helps.
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:49:59.600]  You've got millions of people listening.
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:05.600]  If every listener sent in just one dollar, I mean, that would be obviously fund you to that next level.
[1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:07.600]  We go to way past the next level.
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:08.600]  I mean, that's the issue.
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:15.600]  Barack Obama and John McCain, the news report, spent two and a half billion dollars with all the PACs and the other griffs.
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:19.600]  One dollar for liberty goes for like a million dollars of their money.
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:20.600]  It's force multiplied.
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:21.600]  This is the real resistance.
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:27.600]  That's why he's trying to create a fake grassroots movement to energize what he's doing, just like Bush tried it.
[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:29.600]  And then I realize I'm the tip of the spear.
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:33.600]  I mean, Ron Paul on air said a year ago that half his donations were coming from this show.
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:35.600]  Well, what if I got those donations?
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:36.600]  What could we do?
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:38.600]  We'll be right back.
[1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:46.600]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:47.600]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:56.600]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:50:56.600 --> 1:51:02.600]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:04.600]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:06.600]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:10.600]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:51:10.600 --> 1:51:12.600]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:20.600]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:38.600]  Order your two months supply today by calling 866-295-5305 or order online hbextract.com.
[1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:40.600]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:51:40.600 --> 1:51:43.600]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:45.600]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:46.600]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:48.600]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:51.600]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:56.600]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.?
[1:51:56.600 --> 1:52:04.600]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:10.600]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:14.600]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:21.600]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:24.600]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:24.600 --> 1:52:29.600]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:35.600]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:38.600]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:52:38.600 --> 1:52:40.600]  The headlines are clear.
[1:52:40.600 --> 1:52:43.600]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:46.600]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[1:52:46.600 --> 1:52:48.600]  The market of beast is at hand.
[1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:51.600]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:54.600]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:56.600]  To stay free.
[1:52:56.600 --> 1:52:59.600]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.

[1:53:06.600 --> 1:53:08.600]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds.
[1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:10.600]  For a penny per seed.
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:14.600]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for seven years.
[1:53:14.600 --> 1:53:15.600]  Big John Lipscomb.
[1:53:15.600 --> 1:53:20.600]  Host of Don't Tread on Me is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money.
[1:53:20.600 --> 1:53:23.600]  Selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:25.600]  Restaurants and small delis.
[1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:28.600]  Don't buy from copycats. Their fancy packaging is not free.
[1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:30.600]  Order today before it's too late.

[1:53:34.600 --> 1:53:41.600]  A long-term food solution.

[1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:51.600]  We're going to continue to fight the new world order.
[1:53:51.600 --> 1:53:55.600]  We are eastbound and down, loaded up and trucking.
[1:53:55.600 --> 1:53:59.600]  And we're going to do what they say can't be done, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:53:59.600 --> 1:54:03.600]  Crank this one part of the song up.
[1:54:03.600 --> 1:54:06.600]  So never mind them breaks.
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:09.600]  Because we got no run to make.
[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:11.600]  The boys up there sticking at man up.
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:13.600]  And there's beer and Tex are counting.
[1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:14.600]  The Texans are coming, baby.
[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:17.600]  No matter what it takes.
[1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:20.600]  Eastbound and down, loaded up and trucking.
[1:54:20.600 --> 1:54:22.600]  I'm shaking right now with energy folks.
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:25.600]  I'm shaking. I never shake.
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:27.600]  Long way to go.
[1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:30.600]  And it's a short time to get there.
[1:54:30.600 --> 1:54:33.600]  Those smokies got his ears on.
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:35.600]  And he's hot on your trail.
[1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:38.600]  And he ain't going to rest till you're in jail.
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:41.600]  We just got an FBI subpoena.
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:45.600]  During the break I get to deal with stuff like that around here.
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:47.600]  You know what we got an FBI subpoena?
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:51.600]  It's dingdongsoninfowars.com.
[1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:57.600]  Went into the comment sections and gave out the cop that shot that guy in cold blood in the back's home address.
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:54:59.600]  And said people should go after him.
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:01.600]  We don't get in trouble when that happens.
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:05.600]  The Secret Service and FBI just show up with subpoenas and get your IP address.
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:07.600]  So I hope you enjoy that.
[1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:08.600]  Whoever did that.
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:10.600]  You know we put those comment sections up for you.
[1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:11.600]  I didn't have them for years.
[1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:13.600]  People said why can't we comment?
[1:55:13.600 --> 1:55:15.600]  Because of crap like that.
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:16.600]  But you know what?
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:17.600]  We're leaving it all up.
[1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:18.600]  And it's your problem.
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:19.600]  It's your problem.
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:21.600]  We just got subpoenaed by the FBI.
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:23.600]  What's that FBI agent's name?
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:25.600]  Come on in here, Mike Nelson.
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:27.600]  Sam something.
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:31.600]  And then the subpoena comes through the fax machine.
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:34.600]  I'm eastbound.
[1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:38.600]  Oh here's the best part.
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:40.600]  He's hot on your tail.
[1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:43.600]  And he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[1:55:43.600 --> 1:55:44.600]  So you got to dodge him.
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:45.600]  You got to duck him.
[1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:48.600]  You got to keep that diesel truck in.
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:51.600]  Get that hammer down and give him a hand.
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:55.600]  Hey, what's that FBI agent's name?
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:56.600]  Huh?
[1:55:56.600 --> 1:55:58.600]  Ben 1.
[1:55:58.600 --> 1:56:00.600]  Sam Ben.
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:02.600]  Ben Sam.
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:04.600]  Ben Sam.
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:05.600]  It's bound.
[1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:07.600]  Bound it right.
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:09.600]  I'm gonna keep Mike five minutes in the next hour.
[1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:10.600]  We can do it.
[1:56:10.600 --> 1:56:12.600]  I apologize for making him whole while I rant.
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:16.600]  But in one case with IP addresses with the Secret Service,
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:20.600]  it turned out the same person to try to burn us
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:24.600]  was posting comments saying go after,
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:26.600]  and then they would post it on top of it.
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:27.600]  How dare you?
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:30.600]  I'm reporting you to police that Info Wars is allowing this.
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:32.600]  And we don't have the personnel to go censor these comments,
[1:56:32.600 --> 1:56:34.600]  to go restrict these comments.
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:41.600]  We got a few key words like the N-word or KILL, a politician.
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:43.600]  And then that screws up the servers.
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:45.600]  It's got to scan the comments before it posted.
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:46.600]  But then when the FBI calls,
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:48.600]  we do have to do that.
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:54.600]  So thanks a lot.
[1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:56.600]  My guys were in here at 8 o'clock in the morning having to erase
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:56:59.600]  all those comments on every story about how to go after this bad cops family.
[1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:01.600]  That's what they were saying.
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:03.600]  And then we're so busy around here,
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:06.600]  no one had even told me until I was presented with the subpoena.
[1:57:06.600 --> 1:57:08.600]  So I'm going to do that.
[1:57:08.600 --> 1:57:09.600]  I'm going to do that.
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:10.600]  I'm going to do that.
[1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:11.600]  I'm going to do that.
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:12.600]  I'm going to do that.
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:13.600]  I'm going to do that.
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:14.600]  I'm going to do that.
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:15.600]  I'm going to do that.
[1:57:15.600 --> 1:57:16.600]  I'm going to do that.
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:18.600]  I'm going to do the subpoena.
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:20.600]  So again, that's the fun going on around here.
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:22.600]  I need to be able to hire two or three people
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:25.600]  just to handle all the dirty tricks and things that go on here.
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:28.600]  Now the person wasn't laughing last time who staged all that
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:30.600]  because they thought they were going to get us in trouble
[1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:31.600]  and they got in trouble.
[1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:33.600]  Hey, let me explain something, dummies.
[1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:38.600]  When you write that, you are the ones that have the problems, not me.
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:40.600]  So this is probably another dirty trick
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:43.600]  and you are going to have the FBI come down on your butt.
[1:57:43.600 --> 1:57:45.600]  Mike Rivera, go ahead, sir.
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:46.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:48.600]  A lot of dirty tricks going on.
[1:57:48.600 --> 1:57:51.600]  We have to deal with the same thing ourselves.
[1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:54.600]  We're having to take off a member's post.
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:57.600]  In our case sense, you have to be a paid member to post.
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:57:59.600]  We have ID information on everybody.
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:01.600]  So it keeps some of the nonsense down.
[1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:04.600]  But yeah, Israel has openly admitted they're recruiting people
[1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:07.600]  to try and go out on the blogs and cause as much trouble as they can.
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:08.600]  Show us the Pentagon.
[1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:12.600]  Yeah, and this may very well just be more of the same thing.
[1:58:12.600 --> 1:58:16.600]  Yeah, sick the FBI arm. Unfortunately, if it does track back to somebody
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:17.600]  in one of those government agencies.
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:18.600]  Stay there, stay there.
[1:58:20.600 --> 1:58:22.600]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:22.600 --> 1:58:50.600]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.

[1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:56.600]  that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration,
[1:58:56.600 --> 1:58:57.600]  or Chinese imports.
[1:58:57.600 --> 1:59:00.600]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[1:59:21.600 --> 1:59:50.600]  The first step is getting storable food.
[1:59:50.600 --> 1:59:54.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:54.600 --> 1:59:59.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:01.600]  All right, in two hour number three,
[2:00:01.600 --> 2:00:03.600]  your phone calls, I promise,
[2:00:03.600 --> 2:00:05.600]  for all of you that are patiently holding coming up
[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:07.600]  in the next segment directly.
[2:00:07.600 --> 2:00:10.600]  Mike Rivera, I've been ranting and raving the last 30 minutes
[2:00:10.600 --> 2:00:14.600]  and you were finishing up a point you were making
[2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:16.600]  about the things that are going on.
[2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:18.600]  But I want to go back to the question when your video feed
[2:00:18.600 --> 2:00:22.600]  was cutting out to us about how he's setting up domestic,
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:24.600]  separate from government brigades,
[2:00:24.600 --> 2:00:27.600]  but then they have governmental ad counsel ads
[2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:31.600]  saying join Barack Obama's service group,
[2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:35.600]  USAService.org, and that it's the government promoting
[2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:36.600]  his own private group.
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:39.600]  I mean, is that not classic fascism?
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:41.600]  Well, it absolutely is, but more than that,
[2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:44.600]  it is simply a scam because what they're trying to do
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:46.600]  is they're trying to transfer a lot of the functions
[2:00:46.600 --> 2:00:49.600]  of government onto volunteer groups
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:51.600]  who are going to feel really good and warm and fuzzy
[2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:53.600]  about doing all these wonderful things in their community,
[2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:56.600]  but it's not going to result in taxes going down.
[2:00:56.600 --> 2:00:58.600]  It simply means taxes are going to go toward paying off
[2:00:58.600 --> 2:01:01.600]  all these huge debts, the trillions of dollars worth of money
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:03.600]  that the Federal Reserve has been printing up
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:05.600]  and handing out over the last four months.
[2:01:05.600 --> 2:01:07.600]  That's all going to fall on us,
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:09.600]  so our taxes are going to go up to pay for it all,
[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:12.600]  but because the government can't afford to do any services anymore,
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:15.600]  they're just a collection agency for the bankers now,
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:18.600]  and they're trying to talk us into doing for ourselves
[2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:20.600]  all the things we pay government to do,
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:22.600]  and the bottom line is if we're going to do all this stuff,
[2:01:22.600 --> 2:01:24.600]  if we're going to take care of the elderly
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:26.600]  and we're going to go out and patch the roads
[2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:28.600]  and we're going to go paint things and fix things ourselves,
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:30.600]  what do we even need a government for?
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:33.600]  Certainly not one that's taking more than half of everything that we earn.
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:36.600]  Mike, you hit the nail completely through the board there.
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:38.600]  That's it. They're saying, get ready for austerity.
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:42.600]  Get ready to have to go out and do these functions for government.
[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:45.600]  Meanwhile, all the money is going to go to pay debt to banks
[2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:48.600]  that we gave the money to but to begin with.
[2:01:48.600 --> 2:01:50.600]  That's absolutely correct,
[2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:53.600]  and basically it's the same old song and dance.
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:55.600]  Every government tells their people,
[2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:58.600]  you must make do with less so that we may have more.
[2:01:58.600 --> 2:02:00.600]  Unbelievable.
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:02.600]  I know you'd hope for the best with Obama,
[2:02:02.600 --> 2:02:06.600]  but I heard you on your own show here on Genesis Weeknights
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:08.600]  say that this is a real betrayal.
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:11.600]  Do you not feel sorry for those well-meaning people
[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:13.600]  that you were against war and torture
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:15.600]  and thought Obama would stop at how they're just looking up at him,
[2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:18.600]  like little puppy dogs looking up at their master
[2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:21.600]  and he's planning to put them in a bag and throw them in the river?
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:24.600]  Well, as I was saying before you joined us on the air today,
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:26.600]  watching the faces of the people along the parade route,
[2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:28.600]  the expectation level is so high.
[2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:31.600]  If Barack Obama can't walk on water by the end of the week,
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:34.600]  this can be a huge disappointment because they have oversold him.
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:38.600]  They have oversold him and he's got this huge expectation.
[2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:41.600]  And he's already got this advantage. He's the follow-on to George Bush.
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:43.600]  If he does absolutely nothing,
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:45.600]  he's still going to be seen as an improvement,
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:47.600]  but they've really raised the expectation level
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:49.600]  and he's got to perform now.
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:52.600]  What really happened.com, Mike Rivera,
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:54.600]  in closing, do you think?
[2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:56.600]  Because they've introduced the bills
[2:02:56.600 --> 2:02:58.600]  to where the attorney general gets dictatorial power.
[2:02:58.600 --> 2:03:00.600]  That's what they do. They pass a bill saying the Treasury
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:03.600]  and the private Fed can do whatever they want and can't be reviewed.
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:05.600]  This new law they're trying to pass,
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:07.600]  they've got a lot of cosponsors already and the media isn't reporting on it.
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:12.600]  Allows him to ban any guns he wants just by signing an order.
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:17.600]  And Holder's on record saying he supports the D.C. gun ban and Chicago gun ban.
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:20.600]  Well, obviously the power grab continues.
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:23.600]  I think it's very obvious that the U.S. government
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:26.600]  knows that they've pushed the American people to the edge of revolt.
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:29.600]  They're looking at all the rioting that's taking place across Europe.
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:31.600]  They're looking at the rioting that took place in Oakland.
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:33.600]  We're probably going to get more riots in California
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:35.600]  when the welfare checks stop next month.
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:38.600]  And the U.S. government is trying to figure out some way
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:42.600]  they can talk us all into agreeing to be completely helpless droogs
[2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:46.600]  in their grasp so that the government can sleep better at night.
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:49.600]  I agree. We have this Michelle Obama video and she goes,
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:53.600]  listen, things are about to get really tough, but we care about you.
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:55.600]  Just do what we say. I'm going to play that later.
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:58.600]  Just do what we say and things might be okay.
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:00.600]  It's going to be painful though.
[2:04:00.600 --> 2:04:03.600]  Meanwhile, we're having a $150 million party today.
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:06.600]  And I mean...
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:09.600]  No, it's going to say, yeah, the parties are definitely going to go on.
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:12.600]  We saw with the bailouts to AIG, they throw themselves a party.
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:15.600]  Every one of these corporations that gets another few billion dollars
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:18.600]  of the taxpayers' money, the first thing they do is throw themselves a holiday.
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:20.600]  Mac Rivera, amazing analysis.
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:22.600]  It's great having you be a big part of the show.
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:24.600]  You're on every week now instead of once a month.
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:26.600]  God bless you. We'll talk to you soon.
[2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:28.600]  All right. Thanks a lot, Alex.
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:31.600]  You bet. More phone calls and news and analysis and some video clips.
[2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:33.600]  Straight ahead. Stay with us.
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:35.600]  Defense of the Republic!
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:41.600]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:45.600]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:49.600]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science,
[2:04:49.600 --> 2:04:52.600]  one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[2:04:52.600 --> 2:04:55.600]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power
[2:04:55.600 --> 2:04:57.600]  when you need it most.
[2:04:57.600 --> 2:04:59.600]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly,
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:02.600]  emits no fumes and produces electricity for free.
[2:05:02.600 --> 2:05:05.600]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:08.600]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers,
[2:05:08.600 --> 2:05:10.600]  and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:05:10.600 --> 2:05:13.600]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,
[2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:16.600]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:05:16.600 --> 2:05:18.600]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready
[2:05:18.600 --> 2:05:21.600]  with a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.

[2:07:16.600 --> 2:07:18.600]  you have to worry about.

[2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:43.600]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines,
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:46.600]  the information war continues.
[2:07:46.600 --> 2:08:02.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:05.600]  Okay, I'm going to go through a bunch of your phone calls and coming up,
[2:08:05.600 --> 2:08:09.600]  I'm going to play these new PSAs that are running on TV, radio, everywhere
[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:13.600]  with Obama, with all these pictures of great humanitarians
[2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:16.600]  and people giving in soup kitchens, getting you ready for this.
[2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:20.600]  Just like when they give people AIDS in the vaccines, HIV,
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:23.600]  they then institutionalize it and make it all about red ribbons
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:26.600]  and everybody's part of it or when all these kids are dying of cancer
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:28.600]  now from the shots and other things.
[2:08:28.600 --> 2:08:32.600]  They institutionalize that and make it all a fun thing and you're part of a group now.
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:36.600]  I mean, it's so cold-blooded and sick what they're doing.
[2:08:36.600 --> 2:08:42.600]  And Hooge is a director for local TV.
[2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:43.600]  Well, that's no secret.
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:47.600]  You work at a local TV news channel.
[2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:49.600]  Hooge, this is the American dream.
[2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:50.600]  Remember that woman?
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:54.600]  I'm going to have you in here later, Paul Hartman, nicknamed Hooge.
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:55.600]  This is the American dream.
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:08:58.600]  Is it okay if I talk about you?
[2:08:58.600 --> 2:09:00.600]  Remember that lady saying to George Bush,
[2:09:00.600 --> 2:09:02.600]  I work three jobs and he said,
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:05.600]  oh, that's the American dream.
[2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:07.600]  Well, the American dream is being able to save enough money to live decent,
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:09.600]  to be able to innovate, to not have bureaucrats on your back,
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:14.600]  to be able to work one good job and have an upwardly mobile working class
[2:09:14.600 --> 2:09:20.600]  that can become middle class and grow the middle class and shrink the underclass.
[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:24.600]  Hooge gets up at 2.30 every morning.
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:28.600]  2.30 every morning he gets into work at 3.30.
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:33.600]  3.30 at CBS here locally and he's paid less than he's paid here
[2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:36.600]  and he didn't pay a lot here, folks.
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:40.600]  And then he works till 11 and then he doesn't have time to eat,
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:43.600]  he has to take a sack lunch, he eats while he drives over here
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:47.600]  and then he works here till 5 and then he goes home to his wife and children.
[2:09:47.600 --> 2:09:52.600]  And how old are you?
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:54.600]  27?
[2:09:54.600 --> 2:09:56.600]  And he's a smart, great guy.
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:03.600]  I've been working in radio and TV for a decade at minimum wage, basically.
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:07.600]  I mean, he runs the CBS show in the morning.
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:14.600]  Now, that's an example of what we're talking about and where all of this is going.
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:18.600]  And Barack Obama says, get ready for the pain.
[2:10:18.600 --> 2:10:21.600]  And while he's there this morning, I said, hey, I want to run those new propaganda PSAs
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:26.600]  that the government and the people pay for because a lot of channels get partial money to air these
[2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:30.600]  and then they get aired for free because the FCC says you have to air a certain amount of these
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:35.600]  anti-gun commercials, tattle on your neighbor commercials, anti-Marijuana commercials
[2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:41.600]  to bolster the police state so we can pay for people in prison nonviolent.
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:43.600]  All the government ships in the narcotics.
[2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:45.600]  And he said, yeah, I saw those PSAs this morning.
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:47.600]  They're airing everywhere.
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:55.600]  And it's a PSA, one of them, is a PSA to go join Barack Obama's private group
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:10:58.600]  and he's going to have the forced government groups we've got to go serve in.
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:04.600]  But then the private group and they're running TV and radio ads and print ads everywhere.
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:06.600]  It's all over television.
[2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:07.600]  You're seeing them.
[2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:13.600]  You're watching television.
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:16.600]  I mean, is this Nazi Germany?
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:17.600]  Is this the twilight zone?
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:21.600]  You understand what it means to have a private army, a private group,
[2:11:21.600 --> 2:11:22.600]  and they get to make it sound good.
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:23.600]  It's soup kitchens.
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:24.600]  Then you read.
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:25.600]  It's tattletale squads.
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:26.600]  They're getting everybody recruited.
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:28.600]  They're going to help the whole people and have some soup kitchens.
[2:11:28.600 --> 2:11:29.600]  Come on in here.
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:30.600]  Come on in here.
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:31.600]  Come on in here.
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:32.600]  It's a government group.
[2:11:32.600 --> 2:11:33.600]  Come join in.
[2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:36.600]  It's a private group.
[2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:38.600]  I mean, this is a nightmare.
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:40.600]  It's like, well, you're feeding the homeless.
[2:11:40.600 --> 2:11:42.600]  It has nothing to do with that.
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:43.600]  It's youth brigade.
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:44.600]  It's tattletale squads.
[2:11:44.600 --> 2:11:46.600]  Read the fine print.
[2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:48.600]  And all these suckers going, well, he's good.
[2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:50.600]  He's inviting me and I'm part of the government now.
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:53.600]  And they're going to give people uniforms.
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:11:54.600]  What's next?
[2:11:54.600 --> 2:11:55.600]  Arm bands?
[2:11:55.600 --> 2:11:58.600]  47,000 troops in police on the streets searching people?
[2:11:58.600 --> 2:12:00.600]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:02.600]  I'm going to go quickly to each caller.
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:04.600]  Scott and Pennsylvania, go ahead.
[2:12:04.600 --> 2:12:05.600]  Yeah, hey, Alex.
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:07.600]  I just wanted to have some positive points here.
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:17.600]  The young Americans for liberty are all over the nation distributing stuff against Obama.
[2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:20.600]  They have posters and other things.
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:23.600]  The true grassroots, not the false counterfeit.
[2:12:23.600 --> 2:12:24.600]  Right.
[2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:31.600]  And in a few months, there's going to be a continental Congress, which is sponsored by Bob
[2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:36.600]  Schultz and We The People Foundation in Philadelphia.
[2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:42.600]  And they're having meetings all over the country now to get us back to the Constitution.
[2:12:42.600 --> 2:12:47.600]  And the system knows all these true grassroots groups are exploding, so they're forming their
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:51.600]  counterfeit citizen groups to go after us.
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:52.600]  Right.
[2:12:52.600 --> 2:12:58.600]  And there's a gold money bill in Indiana that's in the state, and there are a few other states
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:00.600]  that are trying to get it passed as well.
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:01.600]  Absolutely.
[2:13:01.600 --> 2:13:03.600]  The elite know as they squeeze us that we'll form resistance.
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:05.600]  That's what Northcom and the troops are for.
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:06.600]  They've admitted themselves.
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:11.600]  And so that's why us exploding our numbers to their unstoppable level is so key and I see
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:12.600]  it happening.
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:19.600]  I mean, I can't, you know, this week, famous rock star called and may come on the show,
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:22.600]  but it's a scared tube and wants to know what they can do.
[2:13:22.600 --> 2:13:25.600]  One of the founders of hip hop called and wants to come into the studio this week, but his
[2:13:25.600 --> 2:13:30.600]  manager in Texas, he's not sure if he can be on the phone.
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:36.600]  I talked to, I can't say who I talked to with one of the, let's just say it's been the top
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:38.600]  TV show on television.
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:40.600]  The entire cast are huge fans.
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:41.600]  They listen to the show.
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:42.600]  They watch the show.
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:44.600]  I mean, literally all the top stars, it's like wildfire.
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  Then I talked to another big Hollywood star.
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:48.600]  I know this weekend.
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:53.600]  They said that my material, my material alone is just all over Hollywood everywhere.
[2:13:53.600 --> 2:13:54.600]  They're freaking out.
[2:13:54.600 --> 2:13:56.600]  They're understanding what's happening, a large percentage.
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:14:00.600]  And then I talked to, well, I'm not going to get into it.
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:02.600]  And I'm not going to, I know these stars and people.
[2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:03.600]  I'm not contacting them.
[2:14:03.600 --> 2:14:06.600]  They're contacting me.
[2:14:06.600 --> 2:14:08.600]  You understand that?
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:11.600]  You understand that Willie Nelson just called my office.
[2:14:11.600 --> 2:14:15.600]  You understand, you know, months ago, I mean, this is happening because, because they're
[2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:17.600]  out there waking up.
[2:14:17.600 --> 2:14:19.600]  They're out there seeing what's going on.
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:22.600]  Now meanwhile, they're trying to counter with this new fake Hollywood thing for Obama.
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:23.600]  And these aren't bad people.
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:24.600]  They're useful idiots.
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:26.600]  They saw how bad Bush was.
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:29.600]  They're hoping there can be change, but they're going to know that we told them it was a fraud
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:32.600]  and they're going to see the fraud quicker because where they're pointing it out.
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:33.600]  Go ahead.
[2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:39.600]  There are attempts like Georgia and Mumbai and everything else.
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:40.600]  I'm not ignoring you.
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:42.600]  They're playing a video over here.
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:44.600]  We're going to play this video later.
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:47.600]  One of these disgusting Obama things.
[2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:48.600]  Go ahead.
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:49.600]  Yeah.
[2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:50.600]  All their false flag attempts have failed.
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:56.600]  The Greek anarchists and the, the Gaza into Israel, all of that has failed.
[2:14:56.600 --> 2:15:01.600]  So I, you know, I don't think that they're going to have a big backing for a new world
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:02.600]  war.
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:04.600]  It's going to have to be an economic war.
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:08.600]  But you heard Ron Paul in the first hour say they made stage something.
[2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:09.600]  Right.
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:14.600]  And I think the biggest, the key was heal for this administration is what they promised
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:20.600]  because that's what the young Americans for, for liberty are trying to point out is that
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:21.600]  he promised change.
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:22.600]  He promised reform.
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:26.600]  They have to shove that in their face and say that this is what you promised.
[2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:28.600]  He gave us what you promised.
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:35.600]  We, we, we want peace and we want, you know, more jobs and more, uh, more money to us.
[2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:38.600]  We'll see what they're doing is they're going to bankrupt the economy so bad.
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:41.600]  But the only jobs will be government through a private corporation.
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:42.600]  I appreciate your call.
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:43.600]  Good to hear from you.
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:45.600]  Let's talk to David in Wisconsin.
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:49.600]  You're on the air, David worldwide on the coronation of the supreme leader.
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:50.600]  Yeah.
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:52.600]  Alex, how are you?
[2:15:52.600 --> 2:15:53.600]  Fired up.
[2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:54.600]  Born again hard.
[2:15:54.600 --> 2:16:00.600]  Hey, listen, um, I originally called for Mike because he was trying to compare Obama
[2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:06.600]  to Lyndon Johnson and all that, not, not knowing that Lyndon Johnson is complicit in JFK's
[2:16:06.600 --> 2:16:07.600]  murder and all that kind of stuff.
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:09.600]  Well, let's talk about Mike.
[2:16:09.600 --> 2:16:10.600]  He tries.
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:11.600]  Yeah, I know.
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:15.600]  Um, the thing is, is I'm, I'm going to send you something every month.
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:18.600]  You know, rededicate myself to doing something for your program.
[2:16:18.600 --> 2:16:24.600]  But, um, I came up with an idea that maybe you should have a product like Alex Jones,
[2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:25.600]  organic or something like that.
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:28.600]  And I know I've just got to try to organize that and get it.
[2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:33.600]  Like coffee or something, you know, something that would sell for everybody and then have
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:36.600]  it just a little bit cheaper than regular organic, you know.
[2:16:36.600 --> 2:16:41.600]  And you, with your name alone, it would just go like crazy.
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:47.600]  Well, I mean, the problem is I'm so, listen, I was up here till 11 o'clock last night
[2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:54.600]  working on the film of the Obama film, banking films, really what it is, police state film,
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:55.600]  but it's all about him.
[2:16:55.600 --> 2:16:56.600]  He's the thread.
[2:16:56.600 --> 2:16:57.600]  I'm not whining.
[2:16:57.600 --> 2:17:01.600]  I mean, I couldn't go to sleep and I got home and I did like a 30 minute audio blog.
[2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:02.600]  I didn't like it.
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:08.600]  So I did a 49 minute one and my wife comes out on the back porch at 135 and she goes,
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:09.600]  what are you doing?
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:11.600]  You're going to have to get up in five hours.
[2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:13.600]  And I said, I can't stand it.
[2:17:13.600 --> 2:17:15.600]  I've got to warn these people.
[2:17:15.600 --> 2:17:20.600]  I mean, I see them all being conned and manipulated because I know we're having an effect.
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:24.600]  That's what makes me burn with desire to fight because I can't believe in my life.
[2:17:24.600 --> 2:17:28.600]  Thanks to you, the listeners and the way you're waking people up and telling people about
[2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:32.600]  how many people we're reaching, it's incredible.
[2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:33.600]  It's incredible.
[2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:34.600]  It's with the responsibility.
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:35.600]  Alex?
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:36.600]  Yes.
[2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:40.320]  I want to just encourage you to keep going.
[2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:46.040]  I know that you're not endless energy, but you are pretty darned endless energy and your
[2:17:46.040 --> 2:17:49.000]  wit and your mind that God's giving you.
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:53.880]  I'm just going to instill a blessing on you and I know everybody that listens wants the
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:17:54.880]  same thing.
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:17:59.880]  God bless you, Alex, I feel so much for you, okay?
[2:17:59.880 --> 2:18:00.880]  God bless you.
[2:18:00.880 --> 2:18:01.880]  I want to say this.
[2:18:01.880 --> 2:18:05.880]  My grandmother, my great grandmother, she's not my great grandmother, I mean, she's a
[2:18:05.880 --> 2:18:10.600]  great person, has been dead for about five years.
[2:18:10.600 --> 2:18:16.120]  She prays for me every day and she means it, I mean, and I can feel it.
[2:18:16.120 --> 2:18:19.800]  And I've had things happen in my life that are just incredible and things happen by the
[2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:24.200]  miraculousness of God that I survived and I know I've always had a mission.
[2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:29.600]  We all have a mission in life and my grandmother's prayers are precious to me and I need them
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:32.920]  and I need all your prayers, but you need prayers as well.
[2:18:32.920 --> 2:18:33.920]  And they're real.
[2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:34.920]  People can laugh at it.
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:36.800]  They can make jokes because they just don't know.
[2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:42.280]  And I just need the prayers because I'm not even afraid of them killing me or setting
[2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:47.080]  me up or destroying me in the media or something, which I know they've tried and planned and
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:50.320]  all the stuff we go through that we don't talk about that goes on behind the scenes.
[2:18:50.320 --> 2:18:53.720]  Our blessings to us because we know that it means we're hitting the enemy hard right between
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:56.360]  the eyes.
[2:18:56.360 --> 2:19:03.280]  But the only fear I've got is being killed or being imprisoned or being set up and not
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:05.960]  being able to continue the work I'm doing.
[2:19:05.960 --> 2:19:10.560]  That's my fear for my children, for everybody.
[2:19:10.560 --> 2:19:14.920]  And I also have the fear that I'm not perfect and I'm not the best at this, but I'm the
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:18.800]  best there is that at least has risen to prominence.
[2:19:18.800 --> 2:19:21.240]  And so I kick myself constantly, just how do I do more?
[2:19:21.240 --> 2:19:22.240]  How do I work smarter?
[2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:23.240]  How do I work better?
[2:19:23.240 --> 2:19:25.120]  How do I get things done?
[2:19:25.120 --> 2:19:29.800]  You know, I mean, we're here fighting with the air conditioners breaking and heaters
[2:19:29.800 --> 2:19:30.800]  breaking every day.
[2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:34.160]  You know, all the stuff you go through and I'm like, man, I've got important work I need
[2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:35.160]  to do.
[2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:38.000]  Well, be right back with your phone calls straight ahead after this quick break.

[2:20:39.360 --> 2:20:42.320]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[2:20:42.320 --> 2:20:46.440]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers and investment advisors won't talk about
[2:20:46.440 --> 2:20:48.480]  gold for your IRA?
[2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:53.640]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the
[2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:59.480]  financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:05.680]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs,
[2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:07.640]  yet no word about IRAs.
[2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:11.740]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[2:21:11.740 --> 2:21:13.100]  you in paper.
[2:21:13.100 --> 2:21:19.000]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:23.520]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:38.960]  Call 800-686-2237, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:44.160]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:21:44.160 --> 2:21:45.660]  against this country.
[2:21:45.660 --> 2:21:49.360]  The enemies struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[2:21:49.360 --> 2:21:50.360]  Bin Laden.
[2:21:50.360 --> 2:21:51.360]  This is his M.O.
[2:21:51.360 --> 2:21:55.040]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:21:55.040 --> 2:21:59.680]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:21:59.680 --> 2:22:02.240]  networks inside the United States.
[2:22:02.240 --> 2:22:06.720]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:12.680]  in and on the U.S.
[2:22:12.680 --> 2:22:18.040]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:22.200]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:23.200]  much more.
[2:22:23.200 --> 2:22:24.200]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:22:29.160 --> 2:22:38.760]  other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:22:38.760 --> 2:22:42.480]  I am so frustrated, I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[2:22:42.480 --> 2:22:43.480]  What?
[2:22:43.480 --> 2:22:45.720]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:47.160]  I read something and forget.
[2:22:47.160 --> 2:22:51.040]  I forget people's names, I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell
[2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:52.400]  people, but I forget, I-
[2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:54.160]  Okay, slow down.
[2:22:54.160 --> 2:22:56.880]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[2:22:56.880 --> 2:23:01.440]  Researchers like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods,
[2:23:01.440 --> 2:23:03.840]  the way the education system taught you.
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:05.440]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:08.440]  You know, I can remember everything now, even entire books.
[2:23:08.440 --> 2:23:09.440]  What?
[2:23:09.440 --> 2:23:10.440]  How?
[2:23:10.440 --> 2:23:12.480]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:16.200]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:20.680]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of
[2:23:20.680 --> 2:23:26.600]  information, including entire books after they complete just 60 lessons, and they offer
[2:23:26.600 --> 2:23:30.800]  a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:31.800]  Wow.
[2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:32.800]  What's the website?
[2:23:32.800 --> 2:24:01.800]  Now, don't forget, it's PMemory.net, the letter P, memory.net.
[2:24:01.800 --> 2:24:26.480]  That's just it.
[2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:36.620]  We are back live going to your phone calls analysis of the Obama Abomination coming up

[2:25:28.760 --> 2:25:36.600]  sadly I say welcome to the United States of Israel and server to that bigoted socialistic
[2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:44.520]  totalitarian criminal regime Israel and because of Obama already just choosing that dual Israeli
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:49.800]  citizen Israeli death forces veteran Ram Israel Emmanuel as his chief of staff I mean that
[2:25:49.800 --> 2:25:56.840]  the crime and speaking of crimes and not the uh... it's a crime that bushes uh... committed
[2:25:56.840 --> 2:26:02.440]  sentences that's just a ploy to get approval from us patriots but those hero border agents

[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:13.600]  criminals now with criminal records and that's a crime and they're beaten and tortured in
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:18.120]  jail and nothing's done about it that's right and can I squeeze in another revolutionary
[2:26:18.120 --> 2:26:25.120]  idea yeah you're on the air okay the my feeling is that global warming is a good thing well
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:30.600]  it's unfortunately the global warming trend has ended and the sun is now uh... not putting
[2:26:30.600 --> 2:26:33.640]  off a lot of radiance they've been studying it for three hundred years one of the first
[2:26:33.640 --> 2:26:37.720]  things heavily scientifically studied properly and it's totally cooled off with no solar
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:42.920]  flares now for about eight months so it's serious issues that's true but in the meanwhile
[2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:48.160]  monocle with key of the is is i mean global warming is the monocle with key of the environmental
[2:26:48.160 --> 2:26:55.640]  movement in other words to distract us with fluff from all the real environmental crises
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:26:59.320]  there are real environmental crisis you know that's right and i disagree with you i think
[2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:04.880]  the human uh... growth of population is a potential problem and but in the meanwhile
[2:27:04.880 --> 2:27:10.160]  water or melted ice is the basis of all life well that's an over-simplification i appreciate
[2:27:10.160 --> 2:27:14.720]  your call uh... obviously that's quite a load for the earth six point six billion under
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:20.800]  current technological systems under the british uh... imperium plan uh... the royal commission

[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:39.200]  issues are the planet could have twenty million people have done properly uh... but it's gonna

[2:34:21.280 --> 2:34:26.360]  comments sir that's what make a couple points for one I was my I was blessed
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:32.520]  with a mother and father well educated and raised me well and one thing you
[2:34:32.520 --> 2:34:36.520]  would always say to me is this is our world every human being this is our
[2:34:36.520 --> 2:34:40.240]  world and we have the right to seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:44.880]  and that's the major that's the problem with the every society we've been so
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:49.960]  dumbed down by the public education that we have no knowledge of our true
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:54.200]  development of ourselves yeah people are seeking after tennis shoes and cars
[2:34:54.200 --> 2:34:58.520]  and making that the penultimate goal in their life instead of the search for
[2:34:58.520 --> 2:35:02.320]  knowledge which will truly empower you the people perish for lack of knowledge
[2:35:02.320 --> 2:35:06.080]  absolutely white what do you think the secret societies are doing where they
[2:35:06.080 --> 2:35:10.160]  hiding they're hiding the ultimate knowledge and that's all and that's all
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:15.360]  the cult means is hidden and the occult is the system of controlling people yeah
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:18.200]  I just have one final question no go ahead I'm gonna quit interrupting it just
[2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:23.320]  all absolutely on target go ahead I mean you make great points you can interrupt
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:27.800]  me anytime but I want to say to all listeners out there you must ask yourself
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:32.880]  what do you truly fear and what will you do to conquer those fears that's what's
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:36.960]  most important we live and we die that's the bottom line what do you do in
[2:35:36.960 --> 2:35:40.520]  between living and dying is what's most important yeah while you're wearing this
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:45.040]  earth suit well and my greatest fear is not being in control of my own mind my
[2:35:45.040 --> 2:35:50.360]  greatest fear is being fooled being con being bamboozled and then I get so sad
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:53.640]  I got sad for Democrats when they worship Clinton knowing he was new world
[2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:57.200]  order and just a puppet I got sad for Republicans who would support torture and
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:36:01.880]  evil and sign their souls on to this war that killed over a million plus
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:08.080]  Iraqis and millions before that with the sanctions in the first war and I and
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:11.680]  then now these poor Obama people they're good folks these poor white yuppies
[2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:15.280]  these poor black folks and just looking up to him and believing his lies when
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:20.520]  his whole agenda is evil and corruption and wicked and he smiles and he puts
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:24.320]  his nose up in the air worse than Queen Elizabeth just just he just sits there
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:29.840]  you know today just arrogantly I mean I mean just his whole demeanor and then he
[2:36:29.840 --> 2:36:34.560]  does that smile came to the fake smile you know that that fake smile the people
[2:36:34.560 --> 2:36:40.080]  it and it's pure it's pure evil and those and and those who are aware can see
[2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:45.480]  right through it I mean I'm a black American Muslim okay and I I can see
[2:36:45.480 --> 2:36:50.000]  right through his his double speaking he does and and how he looks at people how
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:54.200]  he talks down to people and it's not right it's sick and disgusting and for
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:36:58.280]  the African-American population out there to listen I mean wake up seriously
[2:36:58.280 --> 2:37:03.560]  when has the American policy makers people who run this country ever let a
[2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:07.880]  black man be on top of some and do something for his people quote-unquote
[2:37:07.880 --> 2:37:12.400]  which he is not totally doing your last caller made an excellent point where
[2:37:12.400 --> 2:37:16.800]  Obama has sold out to the Zionists as and call them down basically his new
[2:37:16.800 --> 2:37:20.920]  master when he when he put on the the little things that Jewish people wear
[2:37:20.920 --> 2:37:24.800]  nothing against Jews nothing like that but we've been any anyone talking about
[2:37:24.800 --> 2:37:28.520]  you know we're talking about just like the elite of over every country the
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:33.000]  corrupt elite over there it's not just us saying that Israel brags in the
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:38.640]  newspapers that we own Obama right right it just like when Bush was signing
[2:37:38.640 --> 2:37:42.360]  all these documents with a bunch of kabbalahs in the background taking
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:46.720]  pictures and smiling like you know he was doing the devil's work well did you
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:51.880]  see a few months ago right when Obama won and then they turned up about putting
[2:37:51.880 --> 2:37:55.880]  Rahm Emanuel in a chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's dad this former black op
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:38:01.880]  commander in the sod said said my son isn't gonna be like a dirty Arab
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:06.840]  sweeping the floors at the White House he's running things why attack the
[2:38:06.840 --> 2:38:13.160]  Arabs why again I'm against a Nazi you know saying dirty black people and I'm
[2:38:13.160 --> 2:38:16.400]  certainly against somebody saying dirty Jews and I'm against somebody saying
[2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:22.480]  you know he's not some little nobody Arab right you know that that's the point
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:28.800]  um people this all this stuff all this name-calling all the fighting in
[2:38:28.800 --> 2:38:34.240]  between the races and the religion this it's all a ploy they they they laugh at
[2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:37.800]  this this is what they want they want blacks to fight with whites they want
[2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:41.680]  Asians to fight with everybody else they want Jews and Arabs to fight each
[2:38:41.680 --> 2:38:44.960]  other and they always claim they're they always claim they're covering it to
[2:38:44.960 --> 2:38:50.720]  stop it but they actually hype it all up absolutely it's sick it's totally and
[2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:55.200]  completely sick and it's how they control us in fact John Q up top ranking
[2:38:55.200 --> 2:38:58.360]  I'm gonna play part of that and then go to people's calls well I hope Abdul you'll

[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:14.360]  there that are good people and they know what's going on it's so complex how the
[2:39:14.360 --> 2:39:17.280]  Zionists funded Hitler and wouldn't let Jews get out of Germany and made them
[2:39:17.280 --> 2:39:21.560]  pay a million dollar equivalent bounties to the Zionists to get to Israel they
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:27.480]  wouldn't let the Jews get out to New York or London you know it's so
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:32.920]  sophisticated it's so sophisticated it you know it's not just Israel bad you
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:41.600]  know you know that Palestinians good it's it's it's very sophisticated and I
[2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:44.800]  don't know how I mean I mean intellectually studying it constantly
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:47.720]  living eating breathing this it's hard for me to even fully grasp all the
[2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:51.440]  nuances and how they manipulated but basically the globalist always stage
[2:39:51.440 --> 2:39:55.000]  groups off against each other they then control both groups because they control
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:39:58.200]  the central banking they print and issue all the money of the world so they
[2:39:58.200 --> 2:40:05.560]  can buy everybody and then once they've got that in place they abuse both the
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:09.880]  groups or three groups that are fighting with each other four groups and they
[2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:20.560]  play them all off against each other it's just so sick it's just sick so I'm
[2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:23.720]  gonna play a little bit of top ranking they just want us fussing and fighting
[2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:27.320]  they want us to keep on killing one another we have to realize we're all
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:32.160]  God's children we got to come together if the government was run by angels as
[2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:36.640]  Thomas Jefferson said and was gonna run by God and was good you could have
[2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:40.840]  socialism we have unlimited production capacity but there's always people
[2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:44.200]  they're gonna want with somebody else's got you know a communist society where
[2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:47.360]  the elites all live in palaces and the people are all enslaved and a quote
[2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:50.640]  workers paradise you know what the secret police always want and Nazi
[2:40:50.640 --> 2:40:53.680]  Germany or East Germany under the communist or Russia China they want
[2:40:53.680 --> 2:40:56.560]  your good-looking wife or they want your little business or they want you the
[2:40:56.560 --> 2:41:01.720]  you know the tiny plot of land you've got you know under the communist linen
[2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:05.120]  allowed because everybody started starving to death a tiny plot they had to
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:07.640]  go work half the time in the government fields they were allowed about a
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:11.640]  quarter acre and those quarter acres were producing more than all the other
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:21.040]  food production in Russia and and and the arts the entertainment the theater
[2:41:21.040 --> 2:41:25.240]  movies it was all controlled by the inner party and then the starlets all had to
[2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:28.880]  have sex with the party members to be able to get the jobs it's all about
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:33.320]  having your art your liberty all of it controlled it's so dehumanizing and so
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:37.920]  if angels ran the state it would be okay but we have free will so evil people
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:41.520]  are always going to get in control and use that so you decentralized government
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:45.400]  you have a culture educated in liberty and freedom you defend the great jewel
[2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:50.640]  of liberty you let none approach it because government as George Washington
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:57.480]  said is a dangerous servant like fire like fire a dangerous servant and a
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:03.800]  terrible terrible master and they are coming with everything the social
[2:42:03.800 --> 2:42:06.920]  engineering the regulation the control the attacks on the farms and ranches the
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:11.520]  nas the premise society just hundreds of attacks hitting us from all angles
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:14.760]  they're coming and they're bankrupting everything so we got to go to them and
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:18.480]  say help us and they can pose and go look we help you all they loot what's left
[2:42:18.480 --> 2:42:22.040]  for the middle class and transfer the wealth of the offshore bankers back to
[2:42:22.040 --> 2:42:25.440]  your calls in a moment but we're gonna sit here and play top-ranking or part of
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:28.280]  it here it is Bob Marley
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:43:03.760]  keep on killing one another top-ranking top-ranking
[2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:14.880]  or you skeleton or you skeleton or top-ranking
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:28.760]  or did you mean what you said that I saw them come
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:51.880]  and it runs through our lion the brotherly love in the ancient time
[2:43:51.880 --> 2:44:01.440]  the brotherly love the brotherly love the sisterly love the sisterly love
[2:44:01.440 --> 2:44:07.080]  I feel this morning so I don't serve being killed being imprisoned being
[2:44:07.080 --> 2:44:16.120]  tortured it's probably gonna happen I don't feel it the sisterly love I feel
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:33.600]  this morning all they want us to do
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:54.920]  is keep on killing one another top-ranking top-ranking
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:45:11.240]  and we all want to live together as brothers and sisters and the enemy knows
[2:45:11.240 --> 2:45:18.760]  that and so they create a counterfeit of that this fake brotherly love the
[2:45:18.760 --> 2:45:24.800]  sisterly love that's what they're doing right now whites feeling good voting
[2:45:24.800 --> 2:45:27.520]  for Obama thinking they showed they don't dislike black people that they
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:30.480]  want to live in peace you know I grew up in Dallas Texas and I didn't hear
[2:45:30.480 --> 2:45:36.000]  anybody growing up it was white talk bad about the black kids in school I go
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:39.040]  deer hunting with a bunch of rednecks I never heard talk of bad about black
[2:45:39.040 --> 2:45:46.880]  people strangely enough when I've gone to New York City I hear it but then later
[2:45:46.880 --> 2:45:51.560]  in life I did hear those things but the point is is that it's a counterfeit the
[2:45:51.560 --> 2:45:54.920]  enemy creates a counterfeit of our bank our central bank they create a
[2:45:54.920 --> 2:45:58.360]  counterfeit of race relations which is really meant to go oh we didn't get a
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:02.280]  long look we tried to get along and all fell apart or oh get behind Obama show
[2:46:02.280 --> 2:46:05.800]  and see that's what this is all about is this fake brotherly love this oh look
[2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:09.480]  we can all come together we can do what he says and he'll fix it and he'll he'll
[2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:16.640]  stop with the evil white man George Bush did they create counterfeits of
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:21.880]  everything good and decent but they always centralized power they always
[2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:25.720]  bring in the banksters they always militarize the police they always want
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:29.040]  to put the military on the streets Obama's doing everything Bush did but
[2:46:29.040 --> 2:46:33.200]  now Bush it stalled he'd stalled because of resistance he couldn't move
[2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:38.120]  forward anymore now Obama like the flash is going straight ahead carrying that
[2:46:38.120 --> 2:46:42.080]  ball for a touchdown the new order said hey give him the ball boom we Tiger

[2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:53.400]  war but now the liberals are like forget torture forget the war forget the

[2:48:33.560 --> 2:48:38.360]  sir Alex I called you last week and I restrained myself I believe so far
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:41.600]  successfully a hundred percent in calling the show more than once a week I
[2:48:41.600 --> 2:48:45.720]  want to give other people a chance to you know air their views and their
[2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:49.400]  information it's your time you're on the air brother go ahead but I thought it
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:54.480]  was so important to call today after I heard your plea for finances just a few
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:48:59.360]  minutes ago really touched me and what I'd suggested last week is just
[2:48:59.360 --> 2:49:03.520]  basically what I suggest today Alex and that is they're upping the ante very
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:08.000]  quickly with this new president today this administration is going to move
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:13.640]  ahead of it at the blitzkrieg speed we that you're aware of and to stay in the
[2:49:13.640 --> 2:49:17.560]  game with them to be any competition at all you're going you're going to have
[2:49:17.560 --> 2:49:21.680]  to have the financing you're speaking for us all we're all happy to donate to
[2:49:21.680 --> 2:49:25.600]  you Alex because we're donating to our own welfare you're out there for us well
[2:49:25.600 --> 2:49:28.600]  I'm just gonna be honest with people and I'm gonna hold you over but I put him on
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:30.960]  hold I wasn't going to tell this story but I'm gonna briefly tell it and leave
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:33.880]  it at that because I don't like our enemies having victories but because they
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:37.440]  did this I'm gonna do another money bomb in the future because they did this I'm
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:41.720]  just gonna go ahead and start asking for donations I'm it I just wanted to get
[2:49:41.720 --> 2:49:45.360]  there was the office's idea a few thousand dollars for the bullhorn it was
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:51.160]  actually Aaron's idea and then Mike seconded it we put it up we got real
[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:55.520]  beds up to about 20 grand the anti-911 truth groups openly bragged they were
[2:49:55.520 --> 2:49:58.360]  putting in fake beds later after the beds went through we saw they were fake
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:06.040]  they put in scores of fake beds and so the bullhorn did not go for $50,000 they
[2:50:06.040 --> 2:50:10.600]  criminally and eBay says they're doing criminal filings they yes we have to
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:13.760]  wait if we go down each bid all these fake beds to find the real beds we
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:16.760]  probably want to be able to sell that but it won't matter we have told free
[2:50:16.760 --> 2:50:21.120]  lines we have products people can still support us even though and they said you
[2:50:21.120 --> 2:50:24.280]  said they said you son of a bitch Alex some of them even called here they said
[2:50:24.280 --> 2:50:28.200]  you're not gonna sell that bullhorn ever and you're not gonna get money and they
[2:50:28.200 --> 2:50:31.120]  said we're gonna pull the stops out with dirty tricks against you well you know

[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:53.800]  you know it's a lot murky or waters i mean it's not real simple
[3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:57.320]  um when you're talking about the players in the world and about
[3:02:57.320 --> 3:03:02.440]  people's motives and what you've said just earlier
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:06.760]  um brought something to mind to me is that um it actually
[3:03:06.760 --> 3:03:10.440]  when you get to the bottom of the murky water there's something solid down there
[3:03:10.440 --> 3:03:14.360]  um and there's some truth and i think it's um
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:19.160]  evil against good right that's right in the spirit of evil and good
[3:03:19.160 --> 3:03:23.560]  works through everyone yeah so i mean i believe in principles don't you

[3:03:46.680 --> 3:03:51.560]  also got to be loyal to the truth and the morals exactly i mean
[3:03:51.560 --> 3:03:55.080]  like uh you believe the stories in the bible right

[3:03:58.200 --> 3:04:01.880]  have you ever imagined if you went back in time after reading the stories in the
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:04.920]  bible would you have sided with king david
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:10.600]  um in his fights and struggles against the the philistines
[3:04:10.600 --> 3:04:14.200]  well yes okay well i was just wondering um

[3:10:09.320 --> 3:10:14.600]  well i know i i i it's all happening i mean it's all because of hr 1022

[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:21.000]  right on the money sir we make nothing up here that's what i mean i mean they're
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:23.480]  openly announcing world government run by the banks that have engineered
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:26.600]  everything they're openly building fema camps and
[3:10:26.600 --> 3:10:31.080]  and i'm calling a radical i i i'm i'm part of that that unawakened crowd you

[3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:38.440]  example i've got marines calling themselves you know marines with their

[3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:45.160]  and they're on there saying i'm a liar i'm unpatriotic
[3:10:45.160 --> 3:10:48.680]  uh... that there's been no peer-reviewed studies of nine eleven truth groups
[3:10:48.680 --> 3:10:52.520]  uh... when there have been peer-reviewed studies they're delusional but

[3:10:56.920 --> 3:10:59.560]  try to pound home this fourth amendment thing

[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:11.160]  constitution that i was willing to give my life away for
[3:11:11.160 --> 3:11:16.280]  they're they're they're gotten it sir the patriot act has been used google this
[3:11:16.280 --> 3:11:19.080]  patriot act used in non-terror related cases
[3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:23.720]  patriot act using drug cases in one state like four or five years ago only a
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:26.040]  year or two into the patriot act
[3:11:26.040 --> 3:11:29.480]  what was it was south carolina i believe it was one article i read on air i've
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:33.160]  seen hundreds and it said more than ten thousand
[3:11:33.160 --> 3:11:38.680]  non-terror related cases family violence uh... gun crime
[3:11:38.680 --> 3:11:41.960]  drugs was a list of a whole bunch of stuff where they just say we don't even
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:45.160]  use the bill of rights now and the supreme court is getting in
[3:11:45.160 --> 3:11:47.800]  lotsy they said it was for al-qaeda which is fake
[3:11:47.800 --> 3:11:51.880]  but regardless if you believe that they're now saying the troops in north
[3:11:51.880 --> 3:11:56.760]  com and the marines are for suppressing the american people
[3:11:56.760 --> 3:12:01.240]  there is the art of third infantry division ready to mobilize whenever they
[3:12:01.240 --> 3:12:04.040]  need them they started with that and then a month later announced it'll be
[3:12:04.040 --> 3:12:05.960]  twenty thousand troops not four thousand
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:08.760]  now they've announced no it'll actually be sixty thousand
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:11.800]  i've heard it's went all the way up to the entire division
[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:15.880]  which is around no no i mean it's all announced it's army times it in the
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:21.880]  they have marines all over the country running checkpoints at duis
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:24.920]  yeah yeah i've seen that out here in california they called my wife over
[3:12:24.920 --> 3:12:28.840]  read articles we wrote five six seven eight years ago and i said the they
[3:12:28.840 --> 3:12:32.200]  will start at dui checkpoints they will start with bomb disposal they will
[3:12:32.200 --> 3:12:35.640]  start with the jaws of life to help people at car wrecks and airlift
[3:12:35.640 --> 3:12:37.960]  people to get everybody used to why is the army here
[3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:41.320]  well they're here to help stop the drugs you're not against stopping drugs are
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:45.080]  you again obama has announced forced youth brigades
[3:12:45.080 --> 3:12:49.080]  eighteen to twenty four and then instead of talking about on the news they go
[3:12:49.080 --> 3:12:53.480]  obama is going to give soup kitchens see that sounds reasonable
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:12:56.840]  marines are going to help car wrecks
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:13:01.720]  see that's not our job we're not built for that but do you see the psych warfare
[3:13:01.720 --> 3:13:05.560]  i do and unfortunately you know it looks like for the last twenty years of my
[3:13:05.560 --> 3:13:07.960]  life i've been a victim of it
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:10.920]  we've all been victims of it sir i'm not completely awake i don't know
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:14.680]  everything you know i i think i'm to the point
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:18.360]  to where i don't want to know anymore well here's the problem it's just ripping
[3:13:18.360 --> 3:13:20.840]  my heart out here's the problem it's only going to get worse
[3:13:20.840 --> 3:13:24.280]  see people think i'm negative i'm not negative you know let's say
[3:13:24.280 --> 3:13:27.400]  i stepped on a nail and this actually happened when i was a little kid in the construction site
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:31.240]  by the house it got really infected and i kind of ignored it because i never
[3:13:31.240 --> 3:13:33.320]  went to the doctor never even told my parents when i got hurt and stuff and
[3:13:33.320 --> 3:13:35.960]  finally had to go to the doctor and get it all worked on
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:39.960]  now what have it been negative for me to say i've stepped on a nail green pus is
[3:13:39.960 --> 3:13:43.960]  coming out of it is that negative no if you step on a nail and a week later green
[3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:48.520]  pus is coming out of your foot it's positive to admit green pus is coming
[3:13:48.520 --> 3:13:52.520]  out of your foot and that you've got a staff infection and to go to the doctor
[3:13:52.520 --> 3:13:55.960]  now is it negative to admit you stepped on a nail
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:14:00.040]  absolutely not but that's all i'm saying i mean i i they've admitted they've
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:03.080]  built fema camps they've hired 26 000 preachers
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:06.840]  and they've got them out giving sermons about turning your guns in
[3:14:06.840 --> 3:14:10.760]  i mean they're not the pentagon and north com aren't playing games man
[3:14:10.760 --> 3:14:14.840]  they've already stolen 8.5 trillion four trillions been stolen from the pentagon
[3:14:14.840 --> 3:14:20.120]  pension funds the elites are looting us offshore corporations are bringing us
[3:14:20.120 --> 3:14:23.720]  down and they know the public's going to resist so they're making obama a cult
[3:14:23.720 --> 3:14:27.320]  leader to suppress the people and fool them to go along with it and if that
[3:14:27.320 --> 3:14:31.080]  doesn't work they say they're going to use north com on us
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:34.360]  well my opinion on the obama thing is we're going to have to put up with this
[3:14:34.360 --> 3:14:38.280]  for about two three more months this cult of obama thing
[3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:41.560]  but it's going to stop when charlie wrangler tries to push the universal
[3:14:41.560 --> 3:14:46.680]  draft there is all those college kids that went out and mobilized for obama
[3:14:46.680 --> 3:14:49.640]  are finally going to wake up and learn that they are going to be forced to serve
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:14:51.640]  in the military
[3:14:51.640 --> 3:14:54.520]  well see it's worse than that they're not going to make all these yuppie kids do
[3:14:54.520 --> 3:14:57.240]  that they're going to give them uniforms and a one million man
[3:14:57.240 --> 3:15:01.000]  domestic security force and they're going to like it
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:06.360]  oh yeah i heard about that the uh... the security force on there is a green
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:09.080]  so we have video of them already during the campaign
[3:15:09.080 --> 3:15:12.760]  six months ago when obama was here for the debate in austin in green uniforms
[3:15:12.760 --> 3:15:17.800]  with green helmets officially under obama they are going to wear uniforms
[3:15:17.800 --> 3:15:21.960]  environmental corps spy corps police corps
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:27.720]  and then the media is going to focus in on the soup corps
[3:15:27.720 --> 3:15:31.000]  and when you say and when you say you don't want obama control freaks running
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:34.040]  around your neighborhood spying and bossing and shouting people down at
[3:15:34.040 --> 3:15:37.960]  local meetings they're gonna sit there and say you're a racist
[3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:41.720]  and you're against feeding people soup well i'll accept these right back into
[3:15:41.720 --> 3:15:44.520]  what i what i called about today because of these
[3:15:44.520 --> 3:15:47.960]  the this fourth amendment rule that they've loosened they're not only going
[3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:50.760]  to be doing it in your neighborhoods they can walk into your house and look
[3:15:50.760 --> 3:15:53.880]  around and pick serve whatever the hell they want
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:57.960]  and all yeah that's the sneak and peek provision of patriot act they
[3:15:57.960 --> 3:16:01.800]  they pass that and then they're getting the court in line with it
[3:16:01.800 --> 3:16:05.000]  oh well you know look at that subpoena you got today
[3:16:05.000 --> 3:16:08.360]  that poor jerk that wrote that on the website yeah
[3:16:08.360 --> 3:16:11.560]  they are going to come to his house and there is a provision in a patriot act
[3:16:11.560 --> 3:16:14.680]  which i looked at because you told me to go look at it
[3:16:14.680 --> 3:16:18.920]  they can charge him as a terrorist i know and they can do
[3:16:18.920 --> 3:16:23.560]  all those things in the patriot act that are supposed to be against
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:26.120]  terrorists that are supposed to be trying to bring down our government
[3:16:26.120 --> 3:16:31.240]  and use it against a stupid american sir they have charged 17-year-old high
[3:16:31.240 --> 3:16:35.480]  school seniors with no criminal record for writing an article about zombies
[3:16:35.480 --> 3:16:39.560]  attacking a fictitious school for and then the guy's grandparents in this one
[3:16:39.560 --> 3:16:42.120]  case reported on him they charged him
[3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:45.960]  oh look he wrote an article about zombies he wrote a fiction story like
[3:16:45.960 --> 3:16:49.560]  steven king and then his grandparents read it
[3:16:49.560 --> 3:16:53.080]  he lived with them and they reported him and were proud and the police said
[3:16:53.080 --> 3:16:55.640]  great job and they said that doesn't matter if it's a fiction
[3:16:55.640 --> 3:17:00.120]  story you're not allowed to write about that and they charged him as a terrorist
[3:17:00.120 --> 3:17:05.160]  oh my god it's secret police listen i told the story
[3:17:05.160 --> 3:17:08.760]  in my audio blog yesterday my wife hadn't told me about this in a week and a
[3:17:08.760 --> 3:17:11.800]  half she forgot about it before we went on vacation
[3:17:11.800 --> 3:17:15.960]  we had repairmen there at the house you know we had air condition repairmen
[3:17:15.960 --> 3:17:18.680]  and we have garbage disposal repairmen whatever because i don't have the time
[3:17:18.680 --> 3:17:22.360]  to be there and uh my children were you know
[3:17:22.360 --> 3:17:26.360]  we're homeschooling them uh you're trying that out
[3:17:26.360 --> 3:17:32.040]  they're very small and the the people said your children should be in
[3:17:32.040 --> 3:17:35.160]  school and my wife said well no they're they're
[3:17:35.160 --> 3:17:39.160]  homeschooled and they said that's illegal sort of looking at my wife weird
[3:17:39.160 --> 3:17:44.120]  that's it's not illegal you see but but but the point is is that
[3:17:44.120 --> 3:17:47.000]  is that every time i hear about cps going after a family
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:50.200]  its neighbors see the children on recess who are homeschooling
[3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:53.320]  playing on the jungle gym in their backyard in the and they call the police
[3:17:53.320 --> 3:17:57.640]  that's the secret police and now with the loosening of the fourth amendment
[3:17:57.640 --> 3:18:01.720]  they don't have to just stop with what they came to your house for
[3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:05.880]  they can look around and and and you you could be a totally innocent person
[3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:09.320]  doing absolutely nothing wrong in your home they come for one reason and haul
[3:18:09.320 --> 3:18:12.120]  your ass off for something else sir i'm not even looking for the
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:15.640]  stories and in the last couple years i've seen three articles in three
[3:18:15.640 --> 3:18:18.280]  different areas where people went and best buy
[3:18:18.280 --> 3:18:23.640]  walmart in one other place and tried to pay with a two dollar bill
[3:18:23.640 --> 3:18:28.760]  the people are arrested the police come and are so ignorant they don't know a
[3:18:28.760 --> 3:18:31.800]  two dollar bill the Declaration of Independence is real
[3:18:31.800 --> 3:18:35.320]  and then they are in one case we're still charged and went to court and were
[3:18:35.320 --> 3:18:38.600]  convicted because the the judge the jury and
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:41.800]  everyone were so ignorant and the system was so predatory
[3:18:41.800 --> 3:18:45.800]  they got them for trying to use counterfeit funds
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:49.560]  you understand sir there are people going to jail for not vaccinating their
[3:18:49.560 --> 3:18:53.000]  children when there's no law there are people being arrested for handing out
[3:18:53.000 --> 3:18:56.040]  my videos it's in the newspaper and then they still
[3:18:56.040 --> 3:18:59.880]  and then thank god the juries don't convict them one case in Tennessee one in
[3:18:59.880 --> 3:19:03.080]  Kentucky i have a question for you that the whole
[3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:06.200]  dust up with you back in back of the heraldo show in
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:10.680]  new york city that time didn't you guys have a legal permit to be there
[3:19:10.680 --> 3:19:15.000]  we had a permit to march but they all die off anyway
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:17.800]  yes but they said an unauthorized sound device
[3:19:17.800 --> 3:19:21.320]  which was really a two hundred dollar fine so once i got in the jail
[3:19:21.320 --> 3:19:24.360]  the captain came in and there was a crowd protesting and he said yeah this is
[3:19:24.360 --> 3:19:27.080]  non arrestable we're going to let you go then i had to pay like a thousand
[3:19:27.080 --> 3:19:30.680]  dollars in court to have a lawyer appear just to pay the fine in new york for me
[3:19:30.680 --> 3:19:39.400]  a month later we'll be right back stay with us
[3:19:39.480 --> 3:19:44.040]  these are strange new days foreclosures are at record highs people are losing
[3:19:44.040 --> 3:19:47.160]  their jobs the threat of a terrorist attack looms

[3:33:20.120 --> 3:33:23.320]  but now he actually will because they're fully empowering him
[3:33:23.320 --> 3:33:27.640]  to try to get mass group support they've torn down our leaders
[3:33:27.640 --> 3:33:32.280]  demonize them and rightfully so but not pointing out the elite control them
[3:33:32.280 --> 3:33:35.560]  and then now they're finally doing nothing but lavish coverage and giving
[3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:40.520]  somebody that to the public they can believe in

[3:46:13.720 --> 3:46:17.480]  a propaganda at the end it directs you at something that looks governmental

[3:46:55.560 --> 3:46:58.840]  the blackness they hype up the whiteness so see now they're bringing in even
[3:46:58.840 --> 3:47:03.800]  conservatism of hey i'm not an african american i'm an american
[3:47:03.800 --> 3:47:06.760]  see how this and i'm not even saying that's a bad thing that's a good thing

[3:49:14.520 --> 3:49:17.720]  find out what's caused it or to make sure the public doesn't find out so they
[3:49:17.720 --> 3:49:21.080]  can control the poor pathetic victims so they never get together
[3:49:21.080 --> 3:49:25.400]  then actually cause a national movement to stop the eugenics attack

[4:00:41.800 --> 4:00:44.760]  though i may be able to do it on the super cheap's and just have some something

[4:02:53.400 --> 4:02:58.280]  stalinist Maoist than i could have even envisioned it it's more out front it's
[4:02:58.280 --> 4:03:02.360]  more competent it's more focused than we've seen from government
[4:03:02.360 --> 4:03:06.760]  uh it is so classically off the charts wicked and corrupt and bad and so
[4:03:06.760 --> 4:03:11.640]  sicky sweet and lying on the surface about what it's really about
[4:03:11.640 --> 4:03:14.280]  that it um
[4:03:14.280 --> 4:03:21.080]  it just shakes me my very core and but it shakes me awake even more to stand up

[4:03:45.560 --> 4:03:48.920]  trying to organize people and organize the grassroots to get behind government
[4:03:48.920 --> 4:03:51.560]  and these private banks that have hijacked it to do all these horrible
[4:03:51.560 --> 4:03:54.840]  things they know they need people power we have the organic people power we
[4:03:54.840 --> 4:03:57.640]  have a population the majority that knows what's going on but they have a
[4:03:57.640 --> 4:04:01.320]  huge cadre that means well and is dumbed down and we'll go along with all this

[4:06:28.840 --> 4:06:33.160]  interruption then came another pause and a wordless exchange while obama and
[4:06:33.160 --> 4:06:35.800]  us supreme court justice john roberts figured out
[4:06:35.800 --> 4:06:38.680]  that a word or two had been misplaced in the oath

[4:09:42.700 --> 4:09:46.920]  there's nothing new on the sun and what we've seen the past
[4:09:46.920 --> 4:09:50.160]  will repeat itself and these things are
[4:09:50.160 --> 4:09:51.840]  all are all are
[4:09:51.840 --> 4:09:54.860]  eminent these things are coming down the line so
[4:09:54.860 --> 4:09:57.500]  people need to pay attention to those things
[4:09:57.500 --> 4:09:59.160]  and uh...
[4:09:59.160 --> 4:10:00.780]  my second point is
[4:10:00.780 --> 4:10:03.380]  sometimes i want to commend you on this courage
[4:10:03.380 --> 4:10:06.100]  and you know the definition of courage is
[4:10:06.100 --> 4:10:08.100]  you know it's not about being afraid
[4:10:08.100 --> 4:10:08.740]  you know
[4:10:08.740 --> 4:10:12.020]  courage is acting even when you are afraid
[4:10:12.020 --> 4:10:15.820]  you know being going forward than doing what you have to do even in the face
[4:10:15.820 --> 4:10:16.900]  of fear
[4:10:16.900 --> 4:10:17.540]  you know
[4:10:17.540 --> 4:10:21.020]  and and and that's what we need to have in these times is courage
[4:10:21.020 --> 4:10:22.860]  i don't want people to be afraid
[4:10:22.860 --> 4:10:26.580]  of these things that's going to come and i want you to be afraid of not
[4:10:26.580 --> 4:10:29.620]  fighting back and letting this evil win
[4:10:29.620 --> 4:10:34.620]  you know you know what it is alex is is is is is i work with juvenile offenders
[4:10:34.620 --> 4:10:36.420]  and i tell them all the time
[4:10:36.420 --> 4:10:40.580]  when you can't control the situation or do you can control it yourself
[4:10:40.580 --> 4:10:43.680]  you know and they're going to do what they're going to do
[4:10:43.680 --> 4:10:46.700]  that the leaders are going to do what they're going to do this was a great
[4:10:46.700 --> 4:10:49.220]  strategy in bringing barack in
[4:10:49.220 --> 4:10:54.540]  you know the blacks for the blacks and i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm of african descent
[4:10:54.540 --> 4:10:55.500]  you know but
[4:10:55.500 --> 4:10:57.660]  i i i feel that
[4:10:57.660 --> 4:10:59.500]  you know no in the black community
[4:10:59.500 --> 4:11:03.140]  it's nothing that this guy's going to be able to do wrong
[4:11:03.140 --> 4:11:07.020]  because that's the first black president you know and i'm saying with the
[4:11:07.020 --> 4:11:08.460]  white yuppies
[4:11:08.460 --> 4:11:12.460]  and and i and i and i understand that but we we have to
[4:11:12.460 --> 4:11:15.740]  you know like i would tell people there was a little more geniuses they said
[4:11:15.740 --> 4:11:19.100]  obama but it's bush of course you're going to go with obama
[4:11:19.100 --> 4:11:23.300]  yeah you know i mean the bush the bush administration terrorize this for so
[4:11:23.300 --> 4:11:24.180]  long
[4:11:24.180 --> 4:11:27.120]  you know of course anything other than bush people
[4:11:27.120 --> 4:11:30.860]  gladi accept and they bring in how this works on the drop picture
[4:11:30.860 --> 4:11:34.060]  and i'm gonna go back to you let you finish up tristan
[4:11:34.060 --> 4:11:36.060]  okay let's uh...
[4:11:36.060 --> 4:11:39.300]  give me a close up on the drop it a a picture of
[4:11:39.300 --> 4:11:41.220]  other folks that are watching
[4:11:41.220 --> 4:11:44.260]  i'm gonna get a document cam in the ceilings and
[4:11:44.260 --> 4:11:46.860]  it's going to be hard to draw this upside down so i'm just gonna draw it
[4:11:46.860 --> 4:11:49.620]  and then and then hold it up
[4:11:49.620 --> 4:11:53.740]  uh... okay let's say this is what's
[4:11:53.740 --> 4:11:55.460]  here
[4:11:55.460 --> 4:11:59.700]  here the woods and there are fesit birds
[4:11:59.700 --> 4:12:01.500]  in the woods
[4:12:01.500 --> 4:12:02.900]  uh... birds
[4:12:02.900 --> 4:12:06.260]  now how do the british and in all cultures have done this to a hunt
[4:12:06.260 --> 4:12:09.340]  elephants you know i mean uh... any animals
[4:12:09.340 --> 4:12:11.860]  they beat on drums and pots and pans
[4:12:11.860 --> 4:12:13.540]  the servants do
[4:12:13.540 --> 4:12:15.260]  uh... people
[4:12:15.260 --> 4:12:17.740]  behind the birds
[4:12:17.740 --> 4:12:20.700]  and they beat on these pots and pans
[4:12:20.700 --> 4:12:22.340]  me close up
[4:12:22.340 --> 4:12:24.740]  they want to show people this
[4:12:24.740 --> 4:12:29.180]  here are the people they beat on pots and pans here are the birds the pheasants
[4:12:29.180 --> 4:12:31.500]  in england is that the queen hunts
[4:12:31.500 --> 4:12:34.580]  it's an ancient form of hunting they beat on the pots and pans
[4:12:34.580 --> 4:12:37.140]  eleven on fifty acres of woods
[4:12:37.140 --> 4:12:40.780]  and for hours the people march to the woods beat in the pots and pans in a
[4:12:40.780 --> 4:12:42.340]  big crescent
[4:12:42.340 --> 4:12:44.900]  it'll be a big crescent
[4:12:44.900 --> 4:12:46.100]  of people
[4:12:46.100 --> 4:12:49.860]  closing in and then as they get in they'll start closing the crescent
[4:12:49.860 --> 4:12:52.580]  as they walk miles of the woods beat in the pots and pans
[4:12:52.580 --> 4:12:56.340]  and all the animals and all the deer and all the prey
[4:12:56.340 --> 4:12:59.380]  will get closed up as they go through
[4:12:59.380 --> 4:13:01.220]  the woods
[4:13:01.220 --> 4:13:03.420]  and then they'll start closing it out
[4:13:03.420 --> 4:13:05.860]  to where when they come out of the woods
[4:13:05.860 --> 4:13:09.140]  all of
[4:13:09.140 --> 4:13:11.980]  the birds
[4:13:11.980 --> 4:13:14.540]  and the deer and everything else they might want to be hunting but generally
[4:13:14.540 --> 4:13:15.660]  it's just birds
[4:13:15.660 --> 4:13:17.060]  they
[4:13:17.060 --> 4:13:18.980]  who were all spread out in the woods
[4:13:18.980 --> 4:13:21.460]  they will come out in one little group
[4:13:21.460 --> 4:13:25.780]  over just a hundred yards or so hundreds of pheasants flying out
[4:13:25.780 --> 4:13:28.980]  okay now george bush and the tyranny and the corruption
[4:13:28.980 --> 4:13:31.900]  he's the guys beating the bushes
[4:13:31.900 --> 4:13:33.940]  that's the term beating the bushes

[4:17:27.420 --> 4:17:28.300]  involved with them
[4:17:28.300 --> 4:17:31.100]  we told people that a decade ago now it's come out mainstream news that's the
[4:17:31.100 --> 4:17:32.740]  quick and the dirty on it
[4:17:32.740 --> 4:17:34.980]  going back to your analogy
[4:17:34.980 --> 4:17:38.420]  of the guy acting good cop bad cop one guy's bad the other guy acts nice and
[4:17:38.420 --> 4:17:39.460]  they rob you

[4:17:42.340 --> 4:17:45.180]  culture may have happened to you in person
[4:17:45.180 --> 4:17:48.340]  you see a woman in a parking lot running saying help me help me he's hitting me
[4:17:48.340 --> 4:17:50.340]  he's beating me
[4:17:50.340 --> 4:17:53.060]  and then you go hey mister leave her alone
[4:17:53.060 --> 4:17:54.980]  and then you put her in the car with you
[4:17:54.980 --> 4:17:57.620]  and they put a gun to your head she says pull over here and her boyfriend gets
[4:17:57.620 --> 4:17:59.520]  in it says how you stupid schmuck and they
[4:17:59.520 --> 4:18:01.580]  know they kill you or rob you
[4:18:01.580 --> 4:18:03.980]  that's good cop bad cop
[4:18:03.980 --> 4:18:05.420]  and uh...
[4:18:05.420 --> 4:18:08.200]  it's like this whole world is a new world or carnival
[4:18:08.200 --> 4:18:11.460]  and we're just leaving one ride run by george bush and there's a slicker guy in
[4:18:11.460 --> 4:18:12.520]  a conductor hat

[4:21:52.780 --> 4:21:54.940]  live on the phone by radio host
[4:21:54.940 --> 4:21:56.300]  alex jones
[4:21:56.300 --> 4:21:58.740]  uh... hello to you and alex jones
[4:21:58.740 --> 4:22:02.820]  obama's pre-election campaign was focused on getting the u.s. out of the
[4:22:02.820 --> 4:22:07.420]  crisis but this inauguration is the most expensive in the country's history
[4:22:07.420 --> 4:22:09.220]  in a time of financial crisis
[4:22:09.220 --> 4:22:11.340]  is spending so much money
[4:22:11.340 --> 4:22:15.460]  uh... on an inauguration appropriate
[4:22:15.460 --> 4:22:18.500]  uh... well look the anglo-american establishment
[4:22:18.500 --> 4:22:22.500]  is bragging in newsweek magazine the financial times of london henry kissinger
[4:22:22.500 --> 4:22:23.500]  has said
[4:22:23.500 --> 4:22:26.700]  on cnbc television that they have orchestrated
[4:22:26.700 --> 4:22:28.460]  the financial crisis
[4:22:28.460 --> 4:22:31.540]  the oligarchs of england and the united states
[4:22:31.540 --> 4:22:35.180]  uh... are engineering this entire thing so they could care less about a hundred
[4:22:35.180 --> 4:22:36.460]  fifty million dollars
[4:22:36.460 --> 4:22:40.820]  for an auguration a few hundred million more for forty seven thousand
[4:22:40.820 --> 4:22:42.740]  regular army troops and police
[4:22:42.740 --> 4:22:46.020]  on the streets turning america into an open police state
[4:22:46.020 --> 4:22:49.740]  uh... so uh... i mean a hundred fifty million dollars for his parties and his
[4:22:49.740 --> 4:22:51.420]  inauguration
[4:22:51.420 --> 4:22:52.740]  uh... is nothing
[4:22:52.740 --> 4:22:56.180]  we've had to do the overall
[4:22:56.180 --> 4:22:58.860]  program that they're carrying out obama
[4:22:58.860 --> 4:23:02.940]  is betraying everyone we get it in u.s. history
[4:23:02.940 --> 4:23:04.020]  uh... have never
[4:23:04.020 --> 4:23:05.820]  worship the leader is god
[4:23:05.820 --> 4:23:09.220]  our corporate media is saying this guy is basically god
[4:23:09.220 --> 4:23:11.780]  uh... they are trying to get the public
[4:23:11.780 --> 4:23:15.900]  behind all these unpopular things like eight point five trillion stolen by the
[4:23:15.900 --> 4:23:17.780]  bank of england and the federal reserve
[4:23:17.780 --> 4:23:20.420]  out of the u.s. treasury in the last three months
[4:23:20.420 --> 4:23:21.580]  along with the bank of
[4:23:21.580 --> 4:23:22.580]  takeover bill
[4:23:22.580 --> 4:23:26.580]  even bloomberg news admits war powers act has been declared congress
[4:23:26.580 --> 4:23:27.580]  president
[4:23:27.580 --> 4:23:29.860]  partial law and they don't go along with this
[4:23:29.860 --> 4:23:32.780]  bush has passed the baton of iraq obama
[4:23:32.780 --> 4:23:36.100]  he's going to try to get international support
[4:23:36.100 --> 4:23:37.580]  to encircle russia
[4:23:37.580 --> 4:23:38.660]  further
[4:23:38.660 --> 4:23:40.340]  weapons systems into russia
[4:23:40.340 --> 4:23:42.820]  uh... to uh... escalate tensions
[4:23:42.820 --> 4:23:44.100]  uh... with iran
[4:23:44.100 --> 4:23:45.460]  iraq obama
[4:23:45.460 --> 4:23:49.220]  if people didn't like george bush they're gonna hate iraq obama this guy is
[4:23:49.220 --> 4:23:50.020]  a
[4:23:50.020 --> 4:23:53.700]  uh... it is a corporate uh... creation
[4:23:53.700 --> 4:23:56.300]  of the banking elite in this country
[4:23:56.300 --> 4:23:57.740]  uh... so of course
[4:23:57.740 --> 4:24:00.420]  while people are losing their jobs and many economists
[4:24:00.420 --> 4:24:03.700]  click on this magazine are saying we're going into a depression of course
[4:24:03.700 --> 4:24:04.940]  he's partying
[4:24:04.940 --> 4:24:07.540]  uh... like a nineteen ninety nine of course
[4:24:07.540 --> 4:24:10.620]  uh... he's having a great time of course he's arrogantly up there
[4:24:10.620 --> 4:24:12.500]  they can really uh...
[4:24:12.500 --> 4:24:16.420]  uh... but it's almost a leany faces and you're holding his head high with a
[4:24:16.420 --> 4:24:20.700]  chin up in the air they want this guy to act like a messianic
[4:24:20.700 --> 4:24:21.740]  savior
[4:24:21.740 --> 4:24:24.740]  and it's not going to work for setting up youth brigades
[4:24:24.740 --> 4:24:28.140]  uh... compulsory national service in the united states
[4:24:28.140 --> 4:24:30.580]  other organizing like mousetong did
[4:24:30.580 --> 4:24:33.140]  uh... separate group outside government
[4:24:33.140 --> 4:24:37.100]  uh... at u s a service dot org where people will openly
[4:24:37.100 --> 4:24:37.820]  uh...
[4:24:37.820 --> 4:24:40.620]  serve him just like mouse youth court
[4:24:40.620 --> 4:24:44.220]  cannot make this type of stuff up the world needs to dread
[4:24:44.220 --> 4:24:46.900]  rock who's saying obama
[4:24:46.900 --> 4:24:51.220]  okay well let's talk about the economic problems that the democrats are known
[4:24:51.220 --> 4:24:56.220]  as a party which is good at solving economic problems in your opinion is a
[4:24:56.220 --> 4:24:57.140]  new president
[4:24:57.140 --> 4:24:59.300]  does he have the experience to cope
[4:24:59.300 --> 4:25:01.540]  with the current economic problems
[4:25:01.540 --> 4:25:04.660]  well i mean uh... he wants for the elite that engineered it
[4:25:04.660 --> 4:25:07.420]  uh... his new treasury secretary gethner
[4:25:07.420 --> 4:25:09.620]  doesn't even pay income taxes
[4:25:09.620 --> 4:25:12.780]  uh... like the rest of the public to sixty five percent of our congress doesn't
[4:25:12.780 --> 4:25:14.060]  pay income taxes
[4:25:14.060 --> 4:25:17.300]  they are above the law they have exempted themselves
[4:25:17.300 --> 4:25:20.300]  from all the laws we have to follow so people say does he have the experience
[4:25:20.300 --> 4:25:21.380]  to save us
[4:25:21.380 --> 4:25:23.900]  he doesn't want to save us he doesn't want to help us
[4:25:23.900 --> 4:25:25.700]  did the oligarchs in your country
[4:25:25.700 --> 4:25:28.860]  uh... in the mid nineteen ninety one state you know they want to blow the
[4:25:28.860 --> 4:25:29.820]  economy out
[4:25:29.820 --> 4:25:33.420]  with i am at well-bank shock therapy they're going to do that here so they
[4:25:33.420 --> 4:25:37.500]  can be value everything down to almost nothing so they can buy it up for
[4:25:37.500 --> 4:25:38.740]  pennies on the dollar
[4:25:38.740 --> 4:25:44.020]  the collateral commission the cfr they are all openly in publications
[4:25:44.020 --> 4:25:45.220]  admitting
[4:25:45.220 --> 4:25:48.260]  all of this to the public so that's what's so
[4:25:48.260 --> 4:25:52.700]  so incredibly outrageous so no obama doesn't have what it takes to fix this
[4:25:52.700 --> 4:25:54.380]  because that's not his aim
[4:25:54.380 --> 4:25:57.380]  that's not his goal his goal is to sucker the public
[4:25:57.380 --> 4:25:58.460]  on them
[4:25:58.460 --> 4:26:00.220]  to make them love him
[4:26:00.220 --> 4:26:01.860]  and then betray them
[4:26:01.860 --> 4:26:05.060]  so they can get their agenda through they are openly announcing
[4:26:05.060 --> 4:26:06.300]  in newsweek magazine
[4:26:06.300 --> 4:26:09.260]  let's talk about his approval rating
[4:26:09.260 --> 4:26:13.540]  and he enjoys an unprecedented approval rating as we know eighty two percent
[4:26:13.540 --> 4:26:14.660]  i believe in
[4:26:14.660 --> 4:26:20.060]  how will people react if change doesn't happen soon is this high support a
[4:26:20.060 --> 4:26:22.220]  short-lived thing would you say
[4:26:22.220 --> 4:26:24.860]  yes obama and his uh...
[4:26:24.860 --> 4:26:28.700]  vice president biden and all the major analysts say he has one hundred and fifty
[4:26:28.700 --> 4:26:30.100]  the two hundred days
[4:26:30.100 --> 4:26:34.500]  all the public is still somewhat suffered by him and this mass media hope
[4:26:34.500 --> 4:26:38.220]  uh... that's actually a good guy when his open agenda is the opposite of what
[4:26:38.220 --> 4:26:39.500]  this country needs
[4:26:39.500 --> 4:26:40.620]  and so
[4:26:40.620 --> 4:26:45.620]  uh... the people are going to become disillusioned very very quickly
[4:26:45.620 --> 4:26:47.620]  the total corporate media here
[4:26:47.620 --> 4:26:50.940]  is hyping the fact that he's really got a sixty five percent approval rating
[4:26:50.940 --> 4:26:52.420]  it's really not that high
[4:26:52.420 --> 4:26:56.700]  we've been talking to people on the ground in dc on my own radio show today
[4:26:56.700 --> 4:26:58.260]  and they are
[4:26:58.260 --> 4:27:02.180]  uh... you know saying yeah he is betraying us on warrantless wire capping
[4:27:02.180 --> 4:27:04.820]  he is betraying us saying the troops are going to stay in iraq
[4:27:04.820 --> 4:27:06.020]  he is betraying us
[4:27:06.020 --> 4:27:08.020]  with his banker bailout
[4:27:08.020 --> 4:27:09.740]  and so they're already
[4:27:09.740 --> 4:27:13.340]  uh... becoming apprehensive but the meeting in unison
[4:27:13.340 --> 4:27:14.620]  this never happened to me
[4:27:14.620 --> 4:27:18.220]  well why is it happening again? you make it sound like it's a conspiracy
[4:27:18.220 --> 4:27:21.860]  why would you say that the media is doing this? why this big hoax that you're
[4:27:21.860 --> 4:27:24.860]  discussing? you're telling me about it?
[4:27:24.860 --> 4:27:28.780]  the mainline corporate media is owned by the military industrial complex and the
[4:27:28.780 --> 4:27:29.980]  private bank
[4:27:29.980 --> 4:27:32.860]  and they want to take over the united states
[4:27:32.860 --> 4:27:37.540]  they want to destroy the economy they've stated this in their scholarly papers not
[4:27:37.540 --> 4:27:38.660]  on the public
[4:27:38.660 --> 4:27:39.780]  and on the news
[4:27:39.780 --> 4:27:42.340]  so they can consolidate this is a conspiracy
[4:27:42.340 --> 4:27:46.260]  but it is a open conspiracy just like what the oligarchs did
[4:27:46.260 --> 4:27:49.780]  in russia it is the same group it is the same crew
[4:27:49.780 --> 4:27:51.660]  out of england
[4:27:51.660 --> 4:27:53.340]  that are orchestrating this
[4:27:53.340 --> 4:27:56.860]  that's why they are trying to cause a new cold war with russia
[4:27:56.860 --> 4:28:01.300]  because they're angry that your government and your people kicked the oligarch out
[4:28:01.300 --> 4:28:03.340]  we have the same group of oligarchs
[4:28:03.340 --> 4:28:04.740]  in the united states
[4:28:04.740 --> 4:28:08.140]  they're doing this so the media is all getting behind barato obama
[4:28:08.140 --> 4:28:12.300]  whip up support so they can sell the public on going along
[4:28:12.300 --> 4:28:16.500]  with wider agendas they need that mass support
[4:28:16.500 --> 4:28:20.340]  but everything's doing, you want amnesty free legal alien
[4:28:20.340 --> 4:28:21.340]  open board
[4:28:21.340 --> 4:28:24.500]  ninety one percent gallup bulls are against that
[4:28:24.500 --> 4:28:25.780]  you want new bankers take over
[4:28:25.780 --> 4:28:27.740]  attack is unpopular
[4:28:27.740 --> 4:28:30.780]  do you think then in the light of what you've been saying that the American
[4:28:30.780 --> 4:28:36.020]  political spectrum is likely to change under the new president
[4:28:36.020 --> 4:28:38.180]  now that the republic
[4:28:38.180 --> 4:28:40.580]  canary is over
[4:28:40.580 --> 4:28:43.860]  is this an age of liberalism?
[4:28:43.860 --> 4:28:47.220]  no it's a best left cover
[4:28:47.220 --> 4:28:48.260]  so that
[4:28:48.260 --> 4:28:51.820]  just as hitler at first claimed he was a socialist and used left cover he was
[4:28:51.820 --> 4:28:52.980]  really a fascist
[4:28:52.980 --> 4:28:54.940]  same thing with benito musolini
[4:28:54.940 --> 4:28:57.620]  we've seen this over and over again we're going to see
[4:28:57.620 --> 4:28:58.820]  better rhetoric
[4:28:58.820 --> 4:29:01.260]  we're going to see a slicker speaker
[4:29:01.260 --> 4:29:04.180]  with more deceptive tone
[4:29:04.180 --> 4:29:07.420]  reaching out to the world but in words only
[4:29:07.420 --> 4:29:11.580]  the needs are all the same everything obama said he would do a year ago
[4:29:11.580 --> 4:29:12.980]  he has now reversed
[4:29:12.980 --> 4:29:14.580]  promised to
[4:29:14.580 --> 4:29:15.540]  reverse the
[4:29:15.540 --> 4:29:18.460]  undue power is given to the presidency
[4:29:18.460 --> 4:29:21.580]  dictatorial powers
[4:29:21.580 --> 4:29:25.180]  under the john warren defense authorization act of PDD 51
[4:29:25.180 --> 4:29:28.260]  he's now standing up with stefan operas last week
[4:29:28.260 --> 4:29:31.860]  on national television that he agrees with cheney
[4:29:31.860 --> 4:29:35.100]  that he's going to probably keep all those new undue powers
[4:29:35.100 --> 4:29:36.940]  that the presidency is taking on
[4:29:36.940 --> 4:29:40.860]  so what's happening is the military industrial complex
[4:29:40.860 --> 4:29:43.020]  owns both parties
[4:29:43.020 --> 4:29:45.100]  in this country
[4:29:45.100 --> 4:29:47.460]  they brought george bush in after clinton
[4:29:47.460 --> 4:29:49.860]  the full conservative thinking things would change
[4:29:49.860 --> 4:29:52.100]  george bush crippled the size of government
[4:29:52.100 --> 4:29:56.380]  but military on the streets of america and now barack obama is expanding all
[4:29:56.380 --> 4:29:58.060]  of that because barack obama
[4:29:58.060 --> 4:30:00.980]  is a complete and total
[4:30:00.980 --> 4:30:04.220]  of the elite we haven't had a real president
[4:30:04.220 --> 4:30:05.660]  in the united states
[4:30:05.660 --> 4:30:10.460]  they killed don afghanity in nineteen sixty three and and and and he warned
[4:30:10.460 --> 4:30:13.100]  russia's own foreign minister the military
[4:30:13.100 --> 4:30:15.540]  was considering staging a coup against him
[4:30:15.540 --> 4:30:18.700]  during the people of this uh... the missile crisis and that's why russia
[4:30:18.700 --> 4:30:21.380]  uh... went ahead and went for daytime
[4:30:21.380 --> 4:30:24.100]  because kennedy reached out
[4:30:24.100 --> 4:30:26.020]  you understand they want to have a war
[4:30:26.020 --> 4:30:29.420]  they want the state terror attack operation northward
[4:30:29.420 --> 4:30:33.420]  uh... so so so i believe that we're going to see an acceleration
[4:30:33.420 --> 4:30:35.620]  of what we have under board but because
[4:30:35.620 --> 4:30:40.060]  cannot have a new face because the first black president people think
[4:30:40.060 --> 4:30:41.820]  that change but that only
[4:30:41.820 --> 4:30:42.540]  change
[4:30:42.540 --> 4:30:46.660]  on the surface and look at who he's packing his cabinet with
[4:30:46.660 --> 4:30:48.100]  general jim jones
[4:30:48.100 --> 4:30:50.420]  uh... secretary of defense
[4:30:50.420 --> 4:30:53.580]  uh... they are bringing in all of these people who were in the bush
[4:30:53.580 --> 4:30:54.660]  administration
[4:30:54.660 --> 4:30:57.220]  or the worst character from the clinton administration
[4:30:57.220 --> 4:31:00.020]  and all these former i m f and world bank heads
[4:31:00.020 --> 4:31:04.140]  and and and international bankers who were part of the banking oligarchy
[4:31:04.140 --> 4:31:06.260]  that has engineered the collapse
[4:31:06.260 --> 4:31:09.380]  that we're now under the united states is being brought down
[4:31:09.380 --> 4:31:11.100]  by criminal oligarch
[4:31:11.100 --> 4:31:14.860]  and is being looted by design it's obama's job
[4:31:14.860 --> 4:31:16.580]  sister in full the public
[4:31:16.580 --> 4:31:20.140]  to go along with it but when you read the army war college
[4:31:20.140 --> 4:31:23.900]  they openly say that within a year two years that will be open a rebellion in
[4:31:23.900 --> 4:31:27.700]  insurrection of the streets they admit that we're going to use all the new
[4:31:27.700 --> 4:31:30.380]  power they claim work for al-qaeda al-qaeda
[4:31:30.380 --> 4:31:32.260]  against the american people
[4:31:32.260 --> 4:31:37.220]  so talk about a torture here but obama spoke of again
[4:31:37.220 --> 4:31:40.020]  and saturday spoke out against torture
[4:31:40.020 --> 4:31:44.220]  will his presidency be more transparent in terms of how he approaches human
[4:31:44.220 --> 4:31:46.100]  rights issues such as one time a month
[4:31:46.100 --> 4:31:48.300]  and i don't know what you've been saying okay
[4:31:48.300 --> 4:31:48.820]  no
[4:31:48.820 --> 4:31:49.980]  uh... no
[4:31:49.980 --> 4:31:51.460]  what he's going to do is go ahead
[4:31:51.460 --> 4:31:53.180]  better rhetoric
[4:31:53.180 --> 4:31:54.540]  saying he's going to close
[4:31:54.540 --> 4:31:56.940]  want on a movie made
[4:31:56.940 --> 4:32:00.180]  within six months to a year
[4:32:00.180 --> 4:32:04.820]  saying he will close it but a few news reported a week ago we already knew
[4:32:04.820 --> 4:32:05.620]  they have built
[4:32:05.620 --> 4:32:06.940]  work here
[4:32:06.940 --> 4:32:08.820]  on the national map the headline
[4:32:08.820 --> 4:32:12.820]  we remember the part of our nose inside
[4:32:12.820 --> 4:32:15.460]  the united states before they did it outside the country
[4:32:15.460 --> 4:32:16.380]  now they've built
[4:32:16.380 --> 4:32:17.420]  working great
[4:32:17.420 --> 4:32:19.220]  dot carolina
[4:32:19.220 --> 4:32:20.260]  california
[4:32:20.260 --> 4:32:25.140]  these will be totally secret and they've just renamed harsh interrogation
[4:32:25.140 --> 4:32:26.460]  away from torture
[4:32:26.460 --> 4:32:29.740]  and they are going to continue the torture not to mention
[4:32:29.740 --> 4:32:31.460]  an unknown number of
[4:32:31.460 --> 4:32:32.860]  of of of
[4:32:32.860 --> 4:32:35.220]  black off-site
[4:32:35.220 --> 4:32:37.340]  those sites where they
[4:32:37.340 --> 4:32:39.700]  torture people
[4:32:39.700 --> 4:32:40.700]  in georgia
[4:32:40.700 --> 4:32:41.900]  u.s. takes them there
[4:32:41.900 --> 4:32:43.140]  in ukraine
[4:32:43.140 --> 4:32:44.260]  in poland
[4:32:44.260 --> 4:32:45.900]  uh... in egypt
[4:32:45.900 --> 4:32:47.700]  uh... and in georgian
[4:32:47.700 --> 4:32:49.140]  and those are just the cup
[4:32:49.140 --> 4:32:50.820]  in in romania
[4:32:50.820 --> 4:32:52.740]  these are the real torture camp
[4:32:52.740 --> 4:32:55.140]  want on a moment of the public camp
[4:32:55.140 --> 4:32:57.500]  condition of public of the united states

[4:32:59.860 --> 4:33:01.460]  you can't talk with the court
[4:33:01.460 --> 4:33:02.340]  they have built
[4:33:02.340 --> 4:33:05.100]  or one million-man camp
