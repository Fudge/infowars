[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  MUSIC
[00:14.000 --> 00:19.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:19.000 --> 00:21.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:37.000]  MUSIC
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  On this vote, the A's are 230.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  The Nays are 197.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  Present is 1.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  Article 1 is adopted.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  The question is, the question is, the question is on adoption.
[00:57.000 --> 01:09.000]  So, there are the Democrats celebrating the passage of the two articles of impeachment yesterday evening.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  And we're going to be laying it all out and breaking it all down today.
[01:14.000 --> 01:21.000]  Now, I've been on the air 25 years, and as the years go on, I've said many times this is one of the most important broadcasts we've ever done.
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.000]  I used to say it once a year, then I might say it every six months, because there's a quickening.
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  Things are getting more serious, more crazy.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  The human animal cloning, the open devil worship, the open betafilia, the open world government,
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  the open destruction of the family, the open 5G, the fluoridation, the spiked vaccines,
[01:40.000 --> 01:48.000]  the Trojan horse takedown of humanity.
[01:48.000 --> 02:00.000]  But this broadcast is undoubtedly, up to this point, the most important broadcast I will ever do.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  And so I'm not someone to get butterflies or choke up,
[02:05.000 --> 02:17.000]  but I am sweating right now, and it's cold in here, because the stakes are so high on this.
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.000]  This isn't some football game where you just lose a bet if your team doesn't perform.
[02:24.000 --> 02:33.000]  We're talking about decades out in the future being able to shortcut around globalism and unspeakable horrors
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  if we can get nationalists and populists and pro-human candidates into office around the world
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  and roll back the globalist plan.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  Now, a lot of people have said, oh, they'll never impeach him.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  And I said, no, they're going to impeach him, probably fail in the Senate.
[02:50.000 --> 02:59.000]  But they've got a long shot plan to create a civil emergency to remove the president.
[02:59.000 --> 03:08.000]  If we don't expose it, it goes from being a long shot to being 50-50.
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.000]  And that's why they're going with this, even though it's incredibly dangerous to the establishment power structure.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  They're already in so much trouble.
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.000]  It is a Hail Mary.
[03:21.000 --> 03:27.000]  But you just saw all the Pelosiites there cheering, oh, they're very solemn.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  They've heard America, oh, they're so upset to be doing this.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  Oh, they're impartial jurors.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  But then there they are cheering and saying, we're going to impeach the mother effort.
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  Tick-tock, we're going to remove you. Tick-tock, we're going to put you in prison.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  Tick-tock, you're going to die. Tick-tock, we're going to put your family in prison.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  Tick-tock, we're going to attack your supporters.
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.000]  The corporate establishment, lapdog media celebrating, the Washington Post celebrating.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  These are the cell outs. These are the enemies of the Republic.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  And so there is a program.
[04:00.000 --> 04:22.000]  There is an operation. There is a plan to remove the president within the show trial that the House has already had projected into the Senate using that as a platform in the media as a show trial
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  to spring a bunch of other scandals, which they're starting to announce.
[04:30.000 --> 04:37.000]  And then the Supreme Court is meant, and all the blackmail they've got on some of those members, like the Chief Justice,
[04:37.000 --> 04:45.000]  to move in and say the Senate has not been impartial and have the Supreme Court make a run at the president in a true judicial coup.
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.000]  This is openly being discussed by not long for this world.
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It's all coming up. The ultimate cliffhanger.
[04:58.000 --> 05:07.000]  It's your last chance to get the original designer, limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[05:07.000 --> 05:20.000]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnap women and children to compromise world leaders.
[05:20.000 --> 05:33.000]  They do not want this story continuing. And this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word to have a piece of history and to fund our operation.
[05:33.000 --> 05:39.000]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein that these things don't hang themselves on the front.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  On the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in info wars as a wreath. It's also a noose.
[05:45.000 --> 05:53.000]  The system can't stand it when you promote things to grassroots level. They can't stand it when you fund independent pro America, pro human media.
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[05:57.000 --> 06:19.000]  It's your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com.
[06:19.000 --> 06:33.000]  On this boat, the A are 230. The Nays are 197. Present is one. Article one is adopted.
[06:33.000 --> 06:40.000]  The question is, the question is on adoption.
[06:40.000 --> 07:00.000]  And the Democrats went on to high five each other, imitate doing slam dunks, and they said, tick tock, we're going to get you, Mr. President, we're going to get your family, and we're going to get the American people.
[07:00.000 --> 07:12.000]  But not so fast. We can reverse engineer the globalist plan from their statements, their admissions, our sources, and research.
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.000]  Because criminals love to brag. We know their plan.
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  Now, everything we cover here is incredibly important.
[07:22.000 --> 07:31.000]  I predicted that the footage of Epstein's suicide and the previous attempted suicide where they tried to kill him would disappear.
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  That wasn't hard to deduce because they murdered him and cold blood inside there.
[07:36.000 --> 07:46.000]  Now, it turns out that the video has gone missing in both cases, of course, as we told you, two plus equals four.
[07:46.000 --> 07:55.000]  So a lot of these deductions are easy, especially when you know the past behavior of the psychotics and control freaks.
[07:55.000 --> 08:09.000]  Everybody tends to do things in the same patterns, but the criminal mind particularly is robotic and not very creative.
[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  They run the same scams over and over again, refining them, but not really creating new ones.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's the philosophy.
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  And America hadn't been broken, so they're trying to break it so they can, quote, fix it in their own disgusting image.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  So let me make the big announcement here.
[08:27.000 --> 08:36.000]  I could have air raid sirens going on in the background. I could have drum rolls. I could wipe my hair on fire.
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  I mean, if I thought cutting my finger off on air would get your attention to really listen to me, I'd do it.
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  I mean, that's how important all of this is.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  How I'd give my life right now if it meant we could beat these people, for sure, because the innocence deserves it.
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.000]  It's a good price to pay. By the way, I'm not suicidal when I live to be 150 and love God.
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.000]  My point is I'm willing to give my life to beat these people because that's what it's all about.
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  And your life is just your earth suit in this experience, but I'm done talking about that.
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.000]  This is the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[09:19.000 --> 09:28.000]  And you can have a thought with thousands of major points, hundreds of thousands of sub points and data and knowledge and background and understanding
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  that all come together with certainty.
[09:31.000 --> 09:43.000]  And when you have that certainty and you see it time and time again come true exactly as you envisioned, that's called beyond wisdom.
[09:43.000 --> 09:51.000]  It's called discernment and it's called sight.
[09:51.000 --> 10:02.000]  But 99% of it is actually the incredible electrochemical brain supercomputer integrating all those data points, but that little 1% of spirit,
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000]  the electrochemical internet takes you across to the threshold.
[10:07.000 --> 10:13.000]  So what I'm going to do, this is so big, is I'm just going to stop for this segment and kind of mention some of the other news.
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.000]  And then when I come back in the next segment, I'm going to come in with precision.
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  And I'm going to lay the plan out.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  Now we've already seen most of it, we've talked about most of it, but now we know we're right.
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  And I say we, this is a collective brain of the Patriots.
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  This is one focal point, one node.
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  Info wars is like a cerebral cortex of our group mind.
[10:39.000 --> 10:48.000]  We're all individuals, but we combine into the consciousness of liberty and justice and freedom and wanting to have a good future and wanting to be good people
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  and wanting to know the truth and raise our children well.
[10:51.000 --> 11:04.000]  Info wars, these eyes and ears of this experience, a big part of it, a focal point.
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  But there is an ongoing deep state coup against the president.
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  They are desperate because Russia gate failed.
[11:14.000 --> 11:27.000]  And they want you to forget about that and move on into impeachment where they've got four different paths, depending on how this goes that they're going to follow.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  And I'm going to lay those out when we come back and then go into how they're intending to carry it out.
[11:32.000 --> 11:42.000]  And believe me, they have been working to get us off the air and to stop you from spreading the word about this broadcast so that this transmission doesn't get to Congress.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  So that this transmission doesn't get to the Pentagon.
[11:45.000 --> 11:54.000]  So this transmission doesn't get to other governments because there's already consensus on what I'm about to say.
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  I'm not the only one that knows this.
[11:56.000 --> 12:06.000]  And just having it on air and laid out professionally then can then be spread by others to key individuals.
[12:06.000 --> 12:17.000]  And the fact that we know this will send the globalist and their minions into SH-T fits.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  Running around in circles, crapping on themselves.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  Tickets run around with blood squirting out the top.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  Globals run around crapping themselves.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  So we've got it.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  I got the whole thing right here.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  I know exactly what they're going to do, how they're going to try it.
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.000]  And this country is under attack.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  You know, I saw a headline.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  We're going to play this clip coming up.
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  GOP Congressman compares Trump's impeachment to Pearl Harbor.
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  The United States could take getting 3,000 people killed and a bunch of battleships sunk and it was terrible and it was horrible.
[12:53.000 --> 13:02.000]  But frankly Churchill was working with Roosevelt and they had the purple and blue code completely and knew even the day of the attack and ordered the carriers out to sea.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  So they wouldn't be sunk.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  And so the old obsolete battleships, no good for Pacific warfare would be destroyed.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  And they sacrifice 3,000 of our people.
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  We were already at war with Japan for two years in China.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  People like E Howard Hunt were there sniping people daily.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  And that's how you win wars.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  I'm not defending that.
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  It's not a false flag and that the Japanese did it.
[13:28.000 --> 13:37.000]  But it was a gambit where you sacrifice upon in chess to lure your opponent out to win the entire game.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  That's all declassified.
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  Cicero, the great Roman philosopher and senator said that the traitor is the plague.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  An enemy outside with open banners we can defeat.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  The city is strong to a foreign enemy that mobilizes us.
[13:55.000 --> 14:04.000]  But traders within the Senate, traders within the Republic are the plague and can bring it down.
[14:04.000 --> 14:18.000]  And as it was 2,067 years ago when he said that, it is today.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  We're going to break.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  I'm going to come back, but we know their plan.
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  Most of it's already out in the open.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  And we're going to lay it all out right now when we return on the other side.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  Let me add one more point.
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  Info wars is hitting on all cylinders in every sector and absolutely dominating and devastating despite all the attacks.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  Thanks to your support and spreading the words.
[14:44.000 --> 14:51.000]  But in one department that is critical and that's dollar signs, cash.
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.000]  We are at stalemate and unable to grow without getting rid of the small reserves that I have.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  And those reserves are being committed right now.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  This is this is all or nothing.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  So full commitment.
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  I'm just saying I don't like to fight a battle on 10th of a tank and we can get through next year.
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  Maybe I need money.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  So you can see we're tip of the spear.
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  You're tip of the spear.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  This is the real frickin deal.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  We're not playing games here.
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.000]  My God, they have, you know, CIA committee meetings saying get us off the air to save America.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  That means to save their global assets.
[15:25.000 --> 15:29.000]  So if you believe in America and you want to beat these people, you better get to infowarstore.com

[17:16.000 --> 17:34.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[17:48.000 --> 17:58.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[17:58.000 --> 18:14.000]  My fault, my fear. I thought that you'd want what I want. I'm sorry, my dear.
[18:14.000 --> 18:30.000]  But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns. Don't bother them.
[18:30.000 --> 18:38.000]  The globalists have sent in the clowns. They've sent in antifa. They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.000]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines. They've sent in their clowns.
[18:44.000 --> 18:52.000]  But now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere, and I'm so proud of InfoWars leading the charge.
[18:52.000 --> 19:00.000]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[19:00.000 --> 19:11.000]  I've got a problem that I want to confess to the listeners and viewers. I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story
[19:11.000 --> 19:19.000]  that changes the whole world and that really does great things for the future of not just our children, but our children's children.
[19:19.000 --> 19:26.000]  InfoWars really has changed history, and that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot like me,
[19:26.000 --> 19:36.000]  to really think about a world without InfoWars. Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step up to the plate and really financially support our broadcast,
[19:36.000 --> 19:43.000]  going into 2020, we're not going to be on the air in a year or so. If you do support us, we're not just going to stay on the air,
[19:43.000 --> 19:50.000]  but we are going to expand in ways that are going to blow you away. I've never let you down. You've never let me down.
[19:50.000 --> 19:58.000]  Step up to the plate now. Go to InfoWarsTour.com, buy great products and fund our operation and watch us make history together again.
[20:20.000 --> 20:26.000]  From enemies, born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[20:50.000 --> 20:57.000]  We're about to expose the globalist plan to remove the president and trigger a civil emergency.
[20:57.000 --> 21:05.000]  They're not going to be able to execute the plan throughout its completion, and they've got at least four different scenarios,
[21:05.000 --> 21:11.000]  and we've got their entire operation.
[21:11.000 --> 21:18.000]  We're about to lay them all out in the next two segments, and then take your phone calls throughout the broadcast.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  I have canceled guests and cleared the decks.
[21:22.000 --> 21:33.000]  America is fighting for her life, but it's in the animating of contest of liberty that we will rediscover who we are.
[21:33.000 --> 21:44.000]  America hit bottom in the last few years, and now it's coming back up towards the top, and we can see the surface together.
[21:44.000 --> 21:48.000]  Sounds melodramatic, but it's not because it's really happening.
[21:48.000 --> 22:03.000]  It's not hype when it's real. It's not bragging when it's fact. It is where we are now, and once again, America is awakening.
[22:03.000 --> 22:22.000]  The sleeping giant is rising. You can feel the energy. You can feel the power, real power, not satanic power, but the power God put in men to build the future world.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  Alright, let's get right into it.
[22:24.000 --> 22:34.000]  Here is Representative Mike Kelly laying out how high the stakes are, and that this is like Pearl Harbor, except it's more dangerous.
[22:34.000 --> 22:42.000]  It's from within, but if you know about the sneak attack plan, if you know about their operations and how it's going to unfold,
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  they're going to try to make it look like it's real and spontaneous.
[22:45.000 --> 22:59.000]  When it's all been scripted, well then, when those globalist zeros come in over the metaphorical Pearl Harbor, we're going to be waiting for them, and we are.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  Here's what he had to say.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  There's so many great dates in December, and we talk about the wonderful things that have happened in December of the past.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  There's also, in addition to Christmas being something we celebrate, the Boston Tea Party took place in December,
[23:12.000 --> 23:17.000]  but also in December 7th, 1941, a horrific act happened in the United States,
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  and it's one that President Roosevelt said, this is a date that will live in infamy.
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.000]  Today, December the 18th, 2019, is another date that will live in infamy.
[23:27.000 --> 23:36.000]  When just because you hate the President of the United States, and you can find no other reason other than the fact that you're so blinded by your hate that you can't see straight,
[23:36.000 --> 23:43.000]  you've decided the only way we can make sure this President doesn't get elected again is to impeach him.
[23:43.000 --> 23:56.000]  On the floor of the People's House, the bastion of democracy and liberty in the whole world, we have decided that political power is far more important than principle.
[23:56.000 --> 24:03.000]  I would urge all members of the House to vote no on impeachment and to look their voters in the eye and remit.
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.000]  Listen, let me tell you, the voters will remember next November what you're doing this December.
[24:08.000 --> 24:12.000]  This is a terrible time. This is a date that will live in infamy.
[24:12.000 --> 24:24.000]  Music
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.000]  It is December 19th, 2019, 319 days out from the election, and the Democrats know they're losing.
[24:31.000 --> 24:44.000]  They know there's a global political realignment away from leftist, communist, socialist, corporate, crony capitalist, new world order technocrat garbage.
[24:44.000 --> 24:58.000]  The world is awaiting the Chai-Kong Menace. America is awakening to the CFR, the neocons, and they're all now politically fighting for their lives.
[24:58.000 --> 25:14.000]  Heads are gonna roll. That's a fact. America's not backing down. America asleep.
[25:14.000 --> 25:21.000]  And now, the abuse we've gone through is only awakened.
[25:21.000 --> 25:36.000]  All right, let's get into it right now. I'm gonna lay this out as best I can, and then I intend to open the phones up throughout the second, third, and into the fourth hour, and Matt Bracken joins us.
[25:36.000 --> 25:43.000]  The crew did an excellent job last night covering what was unfolding until late in the evening.
[25:43.000 --> 26:01.000]  And I have all the evidence here of what I'm about to break down, but then I also have all the different ways and different avenues and different paths that we can break down how they are intending to make this move,
[26:01.000 --> 26:08.000]  because they do intend on removing President Trump.
[26:08.000 --> 26:16.000]  And we can say, oh, well, it's blowing up in their face. Look at the poll numbers. The fact is they're bold, and they're crazy, and they've got a plan.
[26:16.000 --> 26:26.000]  And so it is bending towards failing spectacularly, but you understand all they do is keep doubling down.
[26:26.000 --> 26:46.000]  And so if you look at what a double down at this level does when it's an open public kangaroo court railroading, well, what comes after that?
[26:46.000 --> 27:07.000]  So I'm going to lay it out, but I just don't want to be like I've been for 25 years, laying out very important things constantly, gibbering as fast as I can talk, trying to get out all the little factoids and then miss the forest for the trees.
[27:07.000 --> 27:18.000]  And we're already too far into this segment for me to do it. I promise. And we come back. I'm going to launch into it all.
[27:18.000 --> 27:31.000]  It's just somebody can prepare for a month to give a speech to a rotary club, and this is all happening in live time, and our analysis has turned out to be right on target again.
[27:31.000 --> 27:45.000]  But now it's taken particular shape on what they're going to pull, and they're now greasing the skids and beta testing it, so that it's out there as a talking point to all the minions who aren't in the inner circles of the Council on
[27:45.000 --> 27:59.000]  Relations and the Carnegie and Ford Rockefeller endowments in this whole deep state group that's already had America under its control for decades, milking us, selling us off, building a corporate world government off our blood, sweat and tears.
[27:59.000 --> 28:08.000]  And now they're totally pissed that we're trying to take our country back. I'm going to play that clip later of the Congressman saying, look at the country. It's all red except these few blue areas.
[28:08.000 --> 28:18.000]  This is about overturning the will of the people, and that's what it is. So I'll say again, what are they going to do next? Can we pull up on inforwars.com, the live feed article.
[28:18.000 --> 28:30.000]  What we do in the morning, David Knight goes live and we have a headline a little bit about the show and then the live feed of his show. And then once I go on, we on top of that, change the headline and put my show on top and then Ellen comes on and so on and so forth.
[28:30.000 --> 28:45.000]  But it's up there and in that headline that you should share with everybody explains exactly where we are and exactly what we're facing exclusive dims deep state plan to remove Trump via the Supreme Court revealed.
[28:45.000 --> 28:57.000]  Again, the dims deep state plan to remove Trump via Supreme Court United States revealed watch live. This is beyond critical. We'll break it down. I promise. I promise when we come back.
[28:57.000 --> 29:12.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[29:12.000 --> 29:26.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[29:26.000 --> 29:38.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life. And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.

[30:00.000 --> 30:10.000]  We're closing out the year 2019. I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be maker to break it. Not just for Info Wars, not just for America, but the whole world.
[30:10.000 --> 30:18.000]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want to post-human world and those that want to pro-human world. We're in a fight between Satan and Christ.
[30:18.000 --> 30:30.000]  And it's being played out amongst us mortals, but it's being directed from on high. And I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast, without you, we're going to lose this fight.
[30:30.000 --> 30:41.000]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important Info Wars is and what we've done together. And just take stock and take measure at the end of the year and think about what you're going to do.

[31:33.000 --> 31:42.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[31:42.000 --> 31:51.000]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to InfoWars.com.

[33:36.000 --> 33:47.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[33:47.000 --> 34:07.000]  It is Thursday, December 19, 2019, 319 days out from the 2020 election.
[34:07.000 --> 34:20.000]  2020. A momentous number. And the political, sociological, economic, spiritual planets are aligning for it.
[34:20.000 --> 34:29.000]  The time of great change. Across roads. An opportunity to do the right thing.
[34:29.000 --> 34:37.000]  So everybody knows that the deep state is the real thing now. It's out in the open. It uses kidnapped children and sex slaves to compromise people.
[34:37.000 --> 34:47.000]  They're absolutely totally evil. They've decided to be evil to have power and control over the earth. And they want to establish a private corporate world government.
[34:47.000 --> 35:14.000]  And they're very, very upset. They're very, very upset that humanity is not going along with it.
[35:14.000 --> 35:27.000]  And so they are going to try what they've done in the past, what other empires have done to get the little people, the average people fighting with each other.
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.000]  When you've got a corrupt establishment that has been exposed, that is on its heels, what do they do? Divide and conquer.
[35:36.000 --> 35:50.000]  Balkanization. The great game is what the British call it. A few thousand British troops could subdue tens of millions of Indians in India by playing different tribes off against each other.
[35:50.000 --> 35:59.000]  And that great game is now used today in the name of multiculturalism, in the name of liberalism.
[35:59.000 --> 36:12.000]  Along comes President Trump and other populists and other nationalists like Boris Johnson and countless others from South America to the UK to the United States to Australia.
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.000]  Promoting just what works. Free market. Loving your nation. The family. Good trade deals.
[36:18.000 --> 36:29.000]  Not demoralizing your country so it can be absorbed into a global system. Not having the communist Chinese world be the model of the planet. A challenge to that authoritarianism.
[36:29.000 --> 36:41.000]  A rediscovery of our moral compass. Rediscovery of directing our own destiny as much as possible and not letting other people direct it.
[36:41.000 --> 36:49.000]  Taking control of the future. Owning it. Living it.
[36:49.000 --> 37:05.000]  And so we've seen Russiagate. What do you do to a president who wants to be the president and wants to empower the country and be incredibly popular and submit their name into the future as the gold standard?
[37:05.000 --> 37:15.000]  You say they're a Russian agent. He didn't take any of the bait. Blew up in their face. So what do you do? Oh, now he's corrupt with what's happening in Ukraine for exposing their corruption.
[37:15.000 --> 37:28.000]  So here's why they had to do impeachment. They don't want Trump to get another Supreme Court justice. And even if this removal fails, they'll say we're not going to confirm anybody that was just impeached.
[37:28.000 --> 37:38.000]  We're not going to confirm anybody nominated by a president like that.
[37:38.000 --> 37:46.000]  And the average leftist is so dumb they think impeachment is conviction. It proves Trump is bad. That's what's being said.
[37:46.000 --> 37:54.000]  And it changes the subject from all the incredible crimes that they've committed and all the bad things they've been up to.
[37:54.000 --> 38:10.000]  And that's not how they remove him. Now, if they can't get that, I'm going to lay this out. They've got other things that they're going to try to do along this path.
[38:10.000 --> 38:26.000]  And I have been saying since before this started three months ago that they will impeach him in the house. And then when it gets to the Senate, they're going to pull out the stops of blackmail, arm twisting threats against the senators.
[38:26.000 --> 38:46.000]  And I also said the Supreme Court could then be brought into play to claim that people weren't impartial. And that would just create another cloud like the Democrats did with the election three years ago to create the real civil unrest going into the election year
[38:46.000 --> 38:55.000]  to tear the nation apart, which is what the globalists and the chai comms want to undermine the nation. That's been their plan all along.
[38:55.000 --> 39:06.000]  So they are going for broke. They are trying to cause a civil emergency. That's why they're going after the guns in places like Virginia.
[39:06.000 --> 39:24.000]  That's why they're saying, hell, yes, we're coming for your AR-15s. Because if they can't beat us politically, they are going to try to trigger an event along racial and along political lines that will tear the country into pieces.
[39:24.000 --> 39:43.000]  Now, it is a big gamble and it's making the president if he survives it even stronger. But they can't help it and have to do it because they're being so politically destroyed by the Jeffrey Epstein information coming out and all of their other corruption coming out
[39:43.000 --> 39:59.000]  and their blue cities collapsing and their alliance with the chai comms and the fentanyl and the chemical warfare against the American people and their alliance with MS-13, God's children, according to Pelosi.
[39:59.000 --> 40:09.000]  And so that's why they're fully committed. Now, here's the big enchilada.
[40:09.000 --> 40:25.000]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who will play the clip coming up next segment, says senators can be disqualified from upcoming impeachment trial if they are not impartial.
[40:25.000 --> 40:35.000]  Now, she doesn't have that power. This whole thing is political. She's a political operative hanging on to life by her fingernails.
[40:35.000 --> 40:41.000]  McConnell said, of course, it's political. The whole house thing was political. It was a railroad job.
[40:41.000 --> 41:03.000]  But she's saying that to bring doubt in and delay the predicate and the foundation for a 25th Amendment challenge to Trump and to a challenge to the Senate proceedings to have the Supreme Court or part of the Supreme Court say it's illegitimate to throw the nation into civil unrest
[41:03.000 --> 41:17.000]  and potentially a hot civil war, which is their plan, their stated plan, because they can't win politically. Again, the ultimate form of balkanization is war, chaos.
[41:17.000 --> 41:26.000]  And there's been excellent articles laying all this out at the conservative treehouse impeachment as a means to an end and not the end itself.
[41:26.000 --> 41:35.000]  This was written in the afternoon yesterday by this morning. It's all over the news and confirmed. That's what's happening.
[41:35.000 --> 41:45.000]  And they're going to claim that the Senate isn't legitimate if they don't let the Democrats run a one sided trial of the president, just like they did in the House.
[41:45.000 --> 42:00.000]  But they know the public is ignorant of how these rules work. And so they're now having Pelosi say that she's going to withhold sending the articles up, certifying them so they can just have that out there that, oh, look,
[42:00.000 --> 42:18.000]  Trump is impeached as if that's a conviction and in a way that he is discredited, waiting while they prepare to roll out women saying the president break them, people saying the president use the n word,
[42:18.000 --> 42:27.000]  people claiming the president has corruption and his tax returns and all sorts of other things and then start saying the Senate is corrupt.
[42:27.000 --> 42:40.000]  They're political and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Democrats, they are not allowed to be blah, blah, blah, to throw all of this into chaos using the buildup to the trial to further divide the country.
[42:40.000 --> 42:51.000]  We're going to go through how they then intend to remove the president and their real plan, which they're now executing, and that only exposure of it can stop them.
[42:51.000 --> 42:58.000]  Please stay with us. I'm Alex Jones, news wars dot com.
[43:22.000 --> 43:32.000]  And this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at info or store dot com to help spread the word to have a piece of history and to fund our operation.

[46:25.000 --> 46:35.000]  I am selling both of the formulas at 65% off the lowest price ever with a free bottle of bio true selenium with it from the mustard seed.
[46:35.000 --> 46:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, research what this does in your body, then experience it for yourself. If you want to go to the next level, I'd say it funds the info war before losing money on this. This is my gift to you this Christmas.
[46:50.000 --> 47:00.000]  So you experience it for yourself like the other products infowarstore.com. That's infowarstore.com. Please take action.
[47:00.000 --> 47:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:30.000 --> 47:50.000]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide. I am your host Alex Jones.
[47:50.000 --> 48:05.000]  And info wars very existence is an act of rebellion against the global tyrants. Your support is war. This is information warfare. This is truth.
[48:05.000 --> 48:13.000]  Head on committed to fight lies. This is life and death.
[48:13.000 --> 48:29.000]  That's not mella drama. That's the cost. That's what we face. That's where we are. These people will take everything from us. We don't start standing up for ourselves.
[48:29.000 --> 48:36.000]  Let me lay it out. There's different scenarios really four different ones to that they'd really like.
[48:36.000 --> 48:45.000]  And when they sit around their boardrooms, they're like, we could discredit him so that when Ginsburg dies, which should be any week, any month, I mean, nobody lives more than a year with what she's got.
[48:45.000 --> 48:56.000]  Supposedly already gone past that pancreatic cancer. She had the best scientists, best doctors she's hanging on now. In and out of the emergency room every week.
[48:56.000 --> 49:07.000]  So by discrediting Trump even with this impeachment and dumbing down the public, but that's a conviction. That's one of the reasons.
[49:07.000 --> 49:14.000]  Further dividing the nation. That's another good reason changing the subject from all the crimes they've committed. That's another reason.
[49:14.000 --> 49:24.000]  And contesting in the next year that he's an illegitimate person ahead of contesting 2020 if they're not able to steal it.
[49:24.000 --> 49:33.000]  So that's the fourth reason. That's why they're doing it, even if they failed the first two or the third option.
[49:33.000 --> 49:45.000]  But here's the first option. They create enough blackmail, enough hysteria, enough problems, enough pressure on these senators.
[49:45.000 --> 50:00.000]  They have division with all the other stories they're going to bring up while they're holding the articles from the Senate, another lawfare tactic.
[50:00.000 --> 50:09.000]  And then the senators start buckling and they vote to remove him. They say for the better of the country, this has just gone on too long.
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.000]  Bad things have come out. And now this latest thing, even though it's not in the trial, I just have to go against the president.
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  That's what they really want, what they're hoping for. That's the hell-marrying.
[50:21.000 --> 50:34.000]  The other one is that part of the Supreme Court says it's political. It's illegitimate. The Senate's running it wrong, even though it's all been a kangaroo event so far.
[50:34.000 --> 50:46.000]  And that triggers civil unrest and anger, and they are blackmailing members of Trump's cabinet and the Senate, and then they create a 25th amendment to the United States event.
[50:46.000 --> 50:54.000]  XXV to the United States Constitution says that if the president becomes unable to do their job, the vice president becomes the president.
[50:54.000 --> 51:03.000]  This could happen for just a little while. The president is just sick or disabled for a short time. It can also happen until the end of the president's term.
[51:03.000 --> 51:12.000]  And they could say that he was mentally incapacitated. So that's the second thing they want.
[51:12.000 --> 51:35.000]  Third thing is civil unrest, violence, breakdown, kills the economy, and that causes enough of a crisis for them to win the election and or get Trump to step down.
[51:35.000 --> 51:41.000]  I want to take your calls to brainstorm all of this, but this is what they're doing. We've talked about these scenarios. We know how they've acted in the past.
[51:41.000 --> 51:45.000]  Now they're preparing it. Now Ginsburg is talking about it.
[51:45.000 --> 51:56.000]  Again, last night, the folks over at Conservative Treehouse Sundance, whoever that is, is a really smart lawyer, obviously, in the government, probably Justice Department.
[51:56.000 --> 52:01.000]  That's what the smart money thinks.
[52:01.000 --> 52:20.000]  I was talking about this weeks ago, actually months ago. And then now they said, oh, watch, this is going to happen today. And it did. That was yesterday. And then now it's on. It's all over the news that she's going to hold these back weeks, months.
[52:20.000 --> 52:28.000]  Who knows till they do what she wants. And she's the one committing the crime, violating the law, violating the House rules, violating all this.
[52:28.000 --> 52:33.000]  But the media will make it like, oh, she's standing up to those bad senators.
[52:33.000 --> 52:43.000]  Trump doesn't get a fair trial. And then the Supreme Court has people like Ginsburg pop in and go, yes, judicially, Pelosi's right, which they're already doing.
[52:43.000 --> 52:51.000]  You can see they're disdain for the public and how ignorant they think we are to even be trying something like this.
[52:51.000 --> 53:06.000]  So that's the plan. What are we going to do about it? Well, we've got to get these articles out. We've got to get this live report out that we'll edit down and post a man dot video out.
[53:06.000 --> 53:14.000]  We've got to have everybody discuss this because this isn't a theory. It's not what we think is happening. It's the deep state spying on the president. He did nothing wrong.
[53:14.000 --> 53:23.000]  They still tried to frame him, blew up in their face and now they're desperate, double down, more desperate.
[53:23.000 --> 53:30.000]  And so what are they going to do if this fails? Well, it goes to option three and four, which are variants of each other.
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  How much civil unrest could they get? I mean, just type in to the search engine.
[53:34.000 --> 53:51.000]  Go to civilwars.com and then Obama documents show Obama planned martial law in Maryland 2015. We got those in January 2018 confirmed 30 pages of anti for secret documents funded by Alexander Soros, how they would go in and break things,
[53:51.000 --> 54:06.000]  including with the police in blue cities, the police commanders to try to trigger blacks to riot. It didn't work. But yeah, put that back on screen.
[54:06.000 --> 54:18.000]  This is the type of stuff. We know the Justice Department is trying to get a race riot going. Trayvon Martin documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[54:18.000 --> 54:27.000]  That article is more important today than it was in January of 2018.
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.000]  Please go read this.
[54:31.000 --> 54:36.000]  The man's family found it and got it to us.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  And we got threatened. We got told you stop that we're going to you're going to get lawsuits and man a week later they also are getting filed.
[54:41.000 --> 54:55.000]  I mean, they are so pissed that we got those. It's smoking gun of criminal terrorist racketeering by Alexander Soros, who is the head funder of that group nationwide.
[54:55.000 --> 55:05.000]  They have maps of you attack this Starbucks and this McDonald's they have deals and let them do it and the police are told to stand down when the only a double or trash can burn a trash can agitate yell throw bottles at the police.
[55:05.000 --> 55:13.000]  They're told to stand down. Not all the cops are in on just the commanders. It's all in there. And then they're trying to get blacks to riot.
[55:13.000 --> 55:22.000]  That's why you go to Ferguson. There's all these white college people getting off buses screaming kill the pigs. Show them. Get them. They hate you.
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.000]  Trying to get black people to start a race war.
[55:27.000 --> 55:38.000]  The media fanning the flames. So they're going to do this with gun confiscation in Virginia trying to cause race riots. It's on now. It doesn't mean they're going to be successful.
[55:38.000 --> 55:48.000]  But they're criminals and we can't sit here and just watch them pull this off and we can't sit here and watch the Justice Department not stop this.
[55:48.000 --> 55:58.000]  I get the systems corrupt and if so much corruption comes out it can bring down the whole system and the globalist you know can pull out tricks but they're already doing it.
[55:58.000 --> 56:07.000]  I want stability. I don't want to have a civil war but the globalist aren't stopping. So the danger is letting them do this. President Trump has to act.
[56:07.000 --> 56:17.000]  The military has to be put on standby. This is not our government doing this. This is not the people doing this. This is the chai comms own most of Hollywood.
[56:17.000 --> 56:29.000]  Four of the big six at least. They are literally funding this. This is foreign attack. This is an attack to take our country down.
[56:29.000 --> 56:38.000]  I mean they demonize Putin because he just has all the Soros heads who aren't Russian bringing billions in a year to overthrow the Russian government and the people. He just has them thrown out of the country.
[56:38.000 --> 56:45.000]  And Russians that work with them get arrested. That's not authoritarianism. If you're a Russian and Russia you can protest all you want. I've studied it.
[56:45.000 --> 56:56.000]  If you're funded by Soros and you're trying to teach five-year-olds how to suck cock you get your ass arrested. Excuse my French but that's what's going on folks.
[56:56.000 --> 57:06.000]  They don't put up with that crap in Russia and neither should we. A bunch of foreign banks and the chai comms over here trying to create a damn war.
[57:06.000 --> 57:15.000]  They're running around trying to get people to go kill people or burn things. I'd get arrested for a conspiracy to commit mayhem and crime and disorder.
[57:15.000 --> 57:25.000]  And I'd spend life in prison and I should. I'd never do that. These people are committing crimes, breaking our borders, funding the refugee centers, assaulting us.
[57:25.000 --> 57:36.000]  And so enough talk. I want the president to do his job and I want him to put them on notice that he knows they're trying to create a civil war and all the rest of it.
[57:36.000 --> 57:47.000]  And if they don't hold the process correctly in the Senate and the rest of it, the executive branch and the American people are going to have to step in and it means war. No more games.
[57:47.000 --> 58:00.000]  Info wars has delivered. Info wars has come through time and time and time and time again at that critical game changing moment.
[58:00.000 --> 58:13.000]  We have come through and that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[58:13.000 --> 58:21.000]  There is no top. There is no bottom. We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen. And the stakes have never been higher.
[58:21.000 --> 58:29.000]  That's what the globalists want to take us out of the game. Only you keep info wars in the game. You are the info war.
[58:29.000 --> 58:42.000]  And now this Christmas and come up to the end of the year is the time to spend your money at infowarstore.com to fund us into this next critical year of 2020 while getting great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.

[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  Globalists are making their real move on America trying to cause a bloody civil war and admitting it.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  I just showed you documents where they're trying to cause a damn race war and get police killed on the general public.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  If you know a crime is being committed and you sit there on your hands, you become complicit in it.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  So I don't say things like this on air to act tough either.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  We're now entering the season of war and people better get their head screwed on straight.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  All right, I'm going to open the phones up throughout the next two hours and 20, 30 minutes or so.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Some of the fourth hour as well. And I have so many clubs and so much other news and so much insanity to get to.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  But impeachment has been sucking the oxygen out of their own, but it is of great importance.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  I mean, we really just laid out the plan and the different angles and different facets and why they're doing it.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Because if you just look at on the surface, well, they don't have the votes.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  They're not going to be able to get rid of Trump.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  Why are they doing this? Well, they're already saying that it's a sham in the Senate and he's guilty in the Democrats.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Pelosi writes the rules about works and appoints who ask the questions and and Trump can't have any witnesses and or will have the Supreme Court remove you and.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  And yes, it's probably going to fail.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  But they're trying.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  You know, it's like a red on yellow kills a fellow coral snake. It's in the Cobra family.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  It's the most poisonous snake in North America.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  And they have a little bitty, tiny things in the back of their mouth that are only about a tenth of an inch long.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  And they got a dummy to get the poison.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  But if any of it gets in, you're dead in a couple minutes.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  And so, I mean, snakes chewing on our hand, Russia gate, all the rest of the crap trying to cause race wars, just trying to plunge the economy,
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  literally trying to block the military getting pay raises and medical care.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  I mean, these people are unbelievable criminals who are hired to destroy the country by globalists and admit it.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  They're foreign enemies.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  They're the enemy combatants, literally. And they're chewing on our hands.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  And I just don't know what to say or do at this point.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  I mean, the president, I know if he gets on air and talks about calling the military out, they're going to seize a dictator.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  At the minute strength is shown, they're going to fold. And Trump has a responsibility to not let them...
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  I mean, Trump knows they're running the State Department still and the open borders.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  He tried to cut back on that. He knows they're trying to cause a race war.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  They should all be indicted.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  If you just indicted some of these people, Alexander Soros is a nice start.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  But everyone's so scared, oh, God, if you talk about them, they're hurting you.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  They're already coming after us, folks.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And I'm not taking it lying down. I don't know about you.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  I'm not taking it lying down. And I'm not taking it bending over either.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  And so the fight's on. And Trump's the real deal.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  And he is in real danger.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Yes, not in the scenario of, oh, they do a straight trial. He'll be totally acquitted. He's done nothing wrong.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  And they always knew it was going to blow up in their face.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  They just are so crazed and so criminal and like wild gamblers, degenerate gamblers,
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  that they just can't help another spin at the roulette wheel.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  They can't help another toss of the dice at the craps table.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  They can't help but put down more money to get another hand of Blackjack.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  I'll give the number out when we come back.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  And I'm going to get to a bunch of clips we haven't played yet.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  As we launch into the future, future, future, future, future, future of 2020.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  I don't know about you, but I'm certainly never bored.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  This is one incredible time to be alive and I'm blessed to be here with you.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  The globalists think America's done. The globalists think the West is done.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  They think that Christians are done and finished. They believe they've broken our backs.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  They believe that with big tech censorship, we'll just crawl into dishes and submit to them.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  And they believe that if they can demonize and shut down info wars, that they rightfully see as a symbol,
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  a beacon of populism and freedom, not just to America, but to the whole world,
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  that they can demoralize everybody else and win.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  While they can shut info wars down, they can intimidate everybody else.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  That's why it's beyond critical that you keep info wars on the air.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your past support.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  by getting great products you need during the 12 days of Christmas and infowarstore.com.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  Massive sales, store-wide free shipping, double-patria points, infowarstore.com.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  Please take action now, George Soros hopes you don't.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  History took place yesterday. I don't need to tell you that.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  Two articles of impeachment, two charges by the House of Representatives of the Grand Jury
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  were passed by a group of partisan anti-American crazed piranhas.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  Now they're demanding control of the Senate trial in violation of law and constitutional rules.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  The leftist Supreme Court's weighing in saying disqualify Republicans
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  because they have to be non-partial, impartial.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  Unbelievable time to be alive. I want to take your phone calls.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  I want to give first-time callers on the first round, the first 20 calls.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  That's what can go up on the board.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  A chance to give us your view on the dirty tricks they're playing,
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  how they've launched the layout I did last hour of the four scenarios they're pushing for
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  and why they see it as a win-win either way to change the subject from their criminality,
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:32.000]  to demoralize the nation, to divide people further,
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  and to then say you can't appoint anybody if Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies because you're an impeached president.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  There's a cloud over you. They already said that over Russiagate, but they failed.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  Two Supreme Court nominees, much better than Hillary would have done.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  This is scaring the hell out of the globalists that were this close to taking this country down.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  And they said in the CFR, they said in the Financial Times of London, the Atlantic Monthly,
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  all the globalist mouthpieces, their organs.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  But if Hillary loses, it's a death blow to globalism.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  And then if we can't get rid of Trump, it's a death blow to globalism.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  And if Al-Assadro gets elected, it's a death blow.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  And oh my gosh, and the Briggs, they're failing everywhere, but they're striking back.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  So I used the Battle of the Bulls analogy.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  D-Day, troops have gotten on land hundreds of thousands of Allied troops.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  And a few months later, the Germans throw their giant reinforcements at them at the Battle of the Bulls.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  The average soldier, though, was about 18 years old.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  And Zeb Dietrich was drunk the whole time, the commander of it.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  So they got their ass kicked.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  But I'm telling you, the counter-offensive's here.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  And they're going to bully people, they're going to sue people, they're going to demonize people, they're going to blackmail.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  If you think media has written lies so far, just outrageous cuckoo stuff that's so over the top, it's cartoonish.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  Get ready, it's going to get a lot worse quick.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  This country's fighting for its life, but it's fighting, and I'm really proud of America.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  And I'm proud of this group of info warriors, because you aren't listeners, you aren't spectators, you're men and women in the arena.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  And I want to hear from you.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-2539.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  877-789-2539.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  If you disagree with me, I think the impeachment's a great thing.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  Hey, we welcome you to the airwaves to give us your perspective as well.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Just tell us you disagree, you'll go to the head of the line, but please be serious.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  877-789-2539.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Okay, let's run through some of these clips that illustrate what I was talking about earlier.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  Here is Ginsburg suggesting senators can be disqualified from upcoming impeachment.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  By who?
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  The branches are co-equal, so one doesn't take over the other, and they keep each other in check.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  So the Supreme Court can only supposedly get involved in an impeachment if there's a tie.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  You got to have the two-thirds, the supermajority, and the vice president can break that, but then what if that was a tie?
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  Well, the Supreme Court.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  So what are they doing? They're just trying to beta test coming in, and then the courts say,
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  oh, it isn't legitimate, or part of the court to add credence to rioting in the streets,
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  which we know they're preparing and getting ready for.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  Here's Ginsburg.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  Indicts.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  And the Senate tries.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Does it should a trier be impartial? Of course.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  That's the job of a judge.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  You will be very aware that there are senators who are already saying,
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  before the impeachment gets to the Senate or the trial in the Senate, they've already made their minds up.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  That's problematic.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  One of the judges said that.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  A judge would be disqualified from sitting on the case.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  They all just worship this punch-back skexie.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  You know, she is the new star of the Dark Crystal movie.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  So.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  There you go.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  And that's where they're going.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  And Pelosi's now saying that they're not going to send up the articles until it's done the way they want,
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  because they're in charge of the whole universe.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  From their feted blue cities collapsing into feces and illegal aliens.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Here's another clip that illustrates it.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  Pelosi won't.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  Get to sending House Democrats articles of impeachment.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  That was a few hours ago.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  Now she just says she's not doing it.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  Here it is.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  Guarantee that the impeachment articles will be, at some point, sent to the Senate.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Can you guarantee that?
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  That would have been our intention, but we'll see what happens over there.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  You may not.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  You're asking me, are we all going to go out and play in the snow?
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  That has not been part of our conversation.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  That has not been part of our conversation.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Notice that she's wearing a dagger brooch, a spike.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  It's all, look at my bullets.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  Look at my bullets.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  I don't like Trump.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Look at my bullets on my wrist.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  My bullet.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  Listen, my bullet bracelet.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  Look, I'm wearing a dagger on my shirt.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  But then her minions are officially saying we're holding it back till we get what we want.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  And that's never before been done and is absolutely precedent breaking.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  And I've got Mitch McConnell talking about that.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  We'll play some of that in the next segment and then go to your calls.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  But let's continue.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Here's Rashid Tlaib.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Glow's about impeachment.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  She's the one that said we're going to impeach the MFR.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  Oh, but she could vote.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  You know, she's impartial, though.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  Ginsburg's fine with that.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Here she is.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  Hey, everyone.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  I am on my way to the United States House floor to impeach.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  President Trump.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  On behalf of my incredible district, 13 District Trump, let's do this.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Let's do this.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Let's impeach the mother effort.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  So that man, she's pretty happy.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And they just never give up.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  They never give up because they want to dominate and control and sack the nation.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  I want to go to Mitch McConnell slams Democrats on the floor.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Celebrations they've been having.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  But I'm also, as I said, going to go to your phone calls, Ryan Hunter, Joe, Sean, Bill, the Sean and many others that are already lining up.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  We really can't wait to take your calls.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  But all of this is moving towards trying to remove him in the fake trial because it was fake in the house.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  So the fruit of the poison trees all poison.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  This whole thing's a sham. No matter what the Republicans try to do in the Senate, it's still all a scam.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  And it may exonerate the president visually and culturally, but it's still all a sinking down into third world them.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  As Mitch McConnell rightfully says, we're going to go to break.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  Remember that in the fight against the globalist, your financial support is literally war bonds in the fight for all of our futures.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  And you can see how cut and dry this is.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  Imagine how far we've come against the new world order against globalism against the deep state.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  Nobody knew about the child kidnapping rings 20 years ago.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Maybe 5%, now 80% do.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  We're really gaining ground so fast.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  It's amazing.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  But you've got to keep the beacons, the lighthouses on air.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  It's the most critical issue is to spread the word and to support outfits like Info Wars.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  And what is there like Info Wars?
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  Not a lot of other places.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  So InfoWarsStore.com, do your Christmas shopping with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  Oh, can I ever?
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Guess what?
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMGTax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112. That's 800-486-8112.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  It's time to take yourself to the next level.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  It doesn't matter if you're a man, doesn't matter if you're a woman, doesn't matter if you're old or young.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  As you age, preglonone levels in the body go down.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  Now, in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglonone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  And then it just gets wilder from there.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  Medical science knows all about this, but they suppress information about preglonone.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  We've got the best form of preglonone with a bunch of high quality vitamins and minerals in real red pill.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Real red pill plus has some added energy as well.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  Now you can get it for 65% off with a free bottle of Biotrus selenium that's from the mustard seed.
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  The two go together in an incredible way.

[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Change your life, take yourself to the next level.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  It's your last chance to get the original designer limited edition Jeffrey Epstein Christmas sweater.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  The globalists are so scared of this story continuing to come out for people learning about the deep state and the international blackmail rings using kidnapped women and children to compromise world leaders.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  They do not want this story continuing.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  And this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of history and to fund our operation.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein. These things don't hang themselves on the front.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  On the back, it's got infowarst.com and shows the O in info wars as a wreath.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  It's also a noose. The system can't stand it when you promote things at the grassroots level.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  They can't stand it when you fund independent pro America, pro human media.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  Now, there is a lot of other huge breaking news, but impeachment is so important.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  The deep state trying to cause a civil war, admittedly trying to cause civil unrest.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  That's really paramount. Your calls are front and center.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  Well, you have some special guests in studio last 30 minutes, the next hour, Savannah Hernandez and one of the other camera people, another nice young lady who got assaulted by men, not just women.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  And we have the video a few days ago on impeachment Eve.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  We have identified the woman that assaulted Savannah. We don't even know where she works.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  We're not like the leftist. We're not going to identify and get her fired, at least not at this point. She may strike back with more lies.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  We did prosecute the lady that sexually assaulted Owen, tried to crush his testicles for no reason.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  She has been convicted and serving jail time. So we are pressing charges.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  That's coming up as well. Big developments on that front.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  And I've got a lot of the clips from yesterday's highlights and new clips today, but I want to move through a lot of your calls.
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  And I want listeners to understand something. And I think you know this better than I. This is real.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  The globalists want civil unrest. They want a war.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  They're probably looking to bomb federal buildings and blame it on talk radio like they did in 95, which they saw as the voice of the people.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  It'll be the internet this time. And so if there's going to be mass shootings or bombings or other false flags to create racial and cultural division, we're entering the zone right now.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  Everybody's got to be alert. It's got to be watchful, including law enforcement, because this country is fighting for its life.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  This is very serious. The next 300 plus days are maximum alert, maximum alert.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  This country is at war with enemies from within working with foreign powers. It's just incredible.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  The last hour I laid out the scenarios, how they're going to challenge the senators saying they're partisan when the Democrats are totally partisan, how they're going to try to bring the Supreme Court in.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  What do you think about all this? Sean in Texas, what's your view?
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  Hey, Alex, before we get started, I just want to say I spent about $4,000 a year at the InfoWars store. I'd encourage anyone to go out there and just get some product.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  You could even share it with a friend or family members to try out and see what it does for you. But I've been very impressed with all your product lines.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  Well, sir, you're the only reason we're on air and we're neck and neck, so thank you for the support.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  Absolutely. So here's my question. Now, this is a hypothetical situation. Let's hypothetically say that at some point in the next six months to a year, the Democrats get their way through illegal means and this thing happens to go kinetic,
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  which obviously none of us want to happen. I've been trying to get through to Matt Bracken and some of these other guys.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  For people like me, if this thing goes hot, who do we point our guns at? I mean, I have neighbors that are Democrats that are good people.
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  I know some pretty crazy liberals that do some pretty crazy things, but we've got a cabal of representatives and people that call themselves Democrats that aren't.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  I mean, the average individual is not in a position to react to this.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  So well, I'm not saying I don't want offensive violence and the globalists get rid of Trump.
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  They're going to plunge the economy and try to hold people hostage to legislatively accept open borders and globalism and political correctness as a price to turn the economy back on like they did when Obama got in.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  They turn the economy off to bring Obama in. They turn the economy partially back on once he got in.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  So obviously the police aren't it. Average stupid libtard isn't it. You remember when they sent the guy to try to kill the Republican baseball team, the Republican caucus to kill Rand Paul and Scalise and others.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  They tried. You know, that guy knew what he was doing. He didn't know how to fire the gun right, but he went and found the leadership.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  And obviously he was wound up and told how to do it and prepared and the Democrats called him a hero.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  A CNN said that, you know, he was a good guy. He wasn't a bad guy. So I don't think anybody should go target Democrats like that.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  But if it goes into civil war and they're confiscating guns and tracking down, you know, patriot leaders and stuff, then these are foreign combatants.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  These are foreign generals. And it's just like any war. That's the high value targets.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  I'm not saying go after those people. We're not in that wheelhouse and the president and better people in the national security system than what we have in Congress need to know the globalist are really making a run in a civil war and all this.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  And so it has to be stopped now. We need to stop it now. We do not talk about violence. We do not need to offensively go out and do anything.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  They're they're going to blow stuff up and say we did it already.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  So obviously daycare centers in federal buildings because they're going to if you're you've got a federal building, you shouldn't have a daycare center in it because that's where the deep states going to hit.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  Okay, because they want to blow kids up.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  If you're in a federal building and there's a daycare center, you're the prime target of your own institutions.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  And so that's where we are.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  So obviously, if there's big riots in the street, people will go to capitals and fight each other there. That's all idiotic. Nobody wants to do that.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Take care of your children. Get the word out.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  It's all information warfare at this point to counter whatever narratives going on if they kill Trump, if they remove Trump, then it's go confront politicians.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  It's it's get on national TV. It's what this guy just did on info wars dot com.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  It's happening every day now. It's a chain reaction.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Must watch info warrior make citizens arrest on Adam Schiff.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  I mean, I've got stacks of stuff just as incredible as this just flooding in, but I'm taking your calls.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  And so that's that. And the first thing you don't want to do, even if you're having to draw up defensive operations, which means they hit us offensively.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  And then we're in a war.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  Well, then you would call that offensive, but, you know, seeking destroyed stuff, seeking clear.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  But again, that's not really offensive.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  That's that's the best defense is a good offense, but we don't want to go down that road.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  But there was a deck of cards. I mean, I think everybody can in their own mind think about who that deck of cards is.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  What do you think, Sean?
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  Well, I guess I guess what I'm really getting at is, you know, there are other forces, you know, military of sorts that, you know, as as individual citizens, we expect to step up and do the right thing at some point.
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  And I guess the real question I'm asking is what, you know, what is the where is the the legal line that gets crossed?
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  They've already crossed it. They want a physical war. They've already crossed it. They think they can trigger a war, stage some stuff, make us all look bad.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  Cassius is the bad guys and then everybody to kind of capitulate and be wimps. That's not going to happen.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  It's going to blow sky high and the chai comms and others will be happy.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  So this is literally an attempt to bring the country down. It's not for the Democrats. The Democrats have no way to win.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  They will be destroyed as a political party. Anything they do, they're done.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  They've already been out for decades. They have to steal all their elections. They only have their little fortress blue latrines that they live in.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  And the little blue latrines around the country, that's all they've got is the cesspits they swim around in.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  And so they're already done. They're done. Any way you slice it, they're done.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  We'll have to have a new political party to have choices between the Republicans because I don't want a one party system.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  Well, then is it the responsibility of the State Department or, you know, V.A.G. to step in and start.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  It is. And because, yes, yes, yes, there should have been indictments a long time ago.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  And because there weren't indictments, it created a vacuum for these people to run wild. And that's where we are right now.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  So perhaps calling, instead of calling your Senators and Representatives, perhaps calling the State Department in demand,
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  that, you know, these criminals are acted against is a better way to go.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  Well, I would find out who all the Soros people are, like Fiona Hill in the State Department.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  And then I'd go to these little CFR events they have in public and get in their face, legally and lawfully.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  They need that pressure put on them to tell them to back off trying to cause a civil war because they're going to be held responsible.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  Soros and his little demon son and all these globalists and Ford Foundation people and all these professors and academics,
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  all these anti-free speech, un-American turds, all these people trying to launch a malice operation.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  They're the enemy if it goes Connecticut.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  Info Wars has delivered. Info Wars has come through time and time and time and time again.
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  At that critical game-changing moment, we have come through.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:22.000]  And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers, the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  There is no top. There is no bottom. We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  And the stakes have never been higher. That's why the globalists want to take us out of the game.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  Only you keep Info Wars in the game. You are the Info War.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  And now, this Christmas, and come up to the end of the year, is the time to spend your money at infowarstore.com,
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  to fund us into this next critical year of 2020 while getting great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  Huge sales right now. Now's the time to shop at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  I'm here to give the listeners and viewers a project report in the next 60 seconds.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  And here's the bottom line. I'm not playing around. I'm not screwing around. I'm not joking. And neither are you.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  Info Wars and this operation we built together has delivered for America, has delivered for our children and the unborn,
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  has delivered in the face of toxic fluoride and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  What we're doing is beyond critical. And do you hear the key word? What we are doing is beyond critical.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  So, this is the time with the biggest sales ever during Christmas at infowarstore.com to get in there and buy these products
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  that you already need, that I need the funding for, to get this operation to the next level. I need the money.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  I need to be able to fight the globalist. I need you. You need these products. Get them at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  So what's the most important part? Let's say the bulldozers are running over the globalist. The treads, the wheels, the engine,
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegor.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  Paraboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system, the capitalism of a human.
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  Some people get 15 hours out of this, some people get about 8 hours, but people take this, people take it in sports,
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts. You can call us whatever you want.
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  It's a total solution all around the best you're going to find.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  Paraboforce, without you, we don't roll. With you, we search forward together. It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind? It's a win-win.
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  All right, let's go ahead and play this important clip from yesterday's saga during the impeachment, a representative from Louisiana, Clay Higgins, when he said it all, knocked it out of the park.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  The same socialist who threatened unborn life in the womb, who threatened First Amendment rights of conservatives, who threatened Second Amendment protections of every American patriot, and who have long ago determined that they would organize and conspire to overthrow President Trump.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  We don't face this horror because the Democrats have all of a sudden become constitutionalists. We're not being devoured from within because of some surreal assertion of the socialist newfound love for the very flag that they trot upon.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  We face this horror because of this map. This is what the Democrats fear. They fear the true will of we, the people. They are a deep establishment, T.C.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  They fear they call this Republican map fly over country. They call us deplorables. They fear our faith. They fear our strength. They fear our unity. They fear our vote. And they fear our president. We will never surrender our nation to career establishment.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  D.C. politicians and bureaucrats, our republic shall survive. This threat from within American patriots shall prevail.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  Wow. And it's all real. Waiting days of 2019, you're living it. Now, I spent a whole 71 caller because he brought up an incredibly important point.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  They're calling for civil war. They're calling for death. They're trying to cause a race war. It's not working. So if it goes kinetic, what are the targets?
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  The targets are get an information warfare now, confront politicians legally and lawfully, get on national TV, expose them for their crimes.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  The whole deep state's coming down. Their cover's been blown. They're trying to cause a civil war, hoping somehow we'll all kill each other and won't notice they did it.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  The answer is information warfare. We're winning in that department. Let's take three or four calls the time we have left this segment because I want to get to everybody.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in California than Ryan Hunter and others. Joe, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  Hey, I'm a first time caller and a disabled combat veteran. I just want to point out that the Constitution, they said only two thirds of the Senate who are present need to be necessary for impeachment.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  And so if Ginsburg saying that they can disqualify senators, they only have to disqual supposedly disqualify 24 Republican senators to bring their 47 votes down to the two thirds majority.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  And that would vindicate them in their own minds.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  Oh, that's right. They've done the math. Here's the deal. They're making a run at the president. We talked about this months ago, weeks ago, days ago, and now they're announcing right out of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and others exactly that they're doing this.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  And what about Pelosi saying she's going to hold off and then string this out until they can launch new scandals against Trump?
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  The only thing I could think about that is just for they have to galvanize their base. They have to get them to, they have to force people into being true believers.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  And if they have true believers, they can supposedly convict Trump with 47 votes by claiming that 24 of the present votes don't count.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  And that will galvanize their, that will galvanize their Antifa army on grounds and it will be bad.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  And before I go, can I, can I plug the products out? Yes, sir, please. I've dealt with, I've dealt with a lot of depression. I've dealt with a lot of suicidal ideation and everything and brain force, real red pill, all of them, the iodine have been great.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  My guts are still messed up. I've been working on it. The iodine has helped. I'm not perfect yet on it, but it has really been fantastic for me not to depend on medicine from the VA and it's been fantastic.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  I've been listening for quite a few years and it's, it's very frustrating to hear all my brothers and sisters who are telling themselves wonder, there's been feeding your brain properly will help do more than poisoning your brain.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  Well, we know it's a cocktail, so many tours being treated like crap, the vaccine's causing damage, attacking endocrine levels.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  And then the guts are so dead because of all the pesticides we've eaten, the food, just good probiotics and things like that are amazing. Most people have iodine deficiencies. That's why X2 or X3 is so good.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  And it really does change people's lives. And so that's why I hope people keep getting the products. I mean, here's an example. We're not going to, where is it? I just had it.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  We're not going to order more of this for a couple of months. It's close to selling out, gut fusion. Now, I knew this was the top formula, but I'd never even taken our own formula.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  I was like, yeah, whatever the top thing is to help, you know, clean up the gut and make it healthy. Well, scientists came up with gut fusion and it's got the different things in it, very high orac level with all of the berry fiber that's in it.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  And then all these other types of organic fiber, the flax seed, the sprouts blend, and it's got the organic apple fruit fiber, organic blueberry fiber, organic cranberry fiber, high auric berry blend.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  And it goes through all of these special berries. But the key to this, and I was reading a study a few weeks ago on air, and I went, wait, our product has an L-glutamine.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  And in the lower intestine, it grows an amino acid that only grows in the lower intestine that's literally the fountain of youth and regenerates cells and regenerates the gut.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  So, you know, obviously it doesn't go, hey, why don't you get cancer down there? I said, why aren't I doing this? I did a whole can of this the last few months and out of everything, the weight, the mood, my skin, it's insane.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  So now I've got my children on it and they're like glowing. So yeah, all these products are amazing. Some people need one, some people need another. Everybody should test them out. These aren't games.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  I go out and say, what is the best product we can get with the best ingredients? God bless you and I appreciate your call, sir.

[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  Now, I'm done plugging now. We're going to plug this segment since he brought it up. We're going to do no more plugging for the rest of the hour and try to take more of your calls. Let's go back to calls.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ryan in Florida and then we'll go to Alyssa. Go ahead, Ryan. Thanks for calling.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  Thanks, Alex, man. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to bring up an idea or a point. I'm a huge Trump supporter and I just want to maybe just put that to the side for now and just kind of look at everything in kind of a different view.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  In my opinion, you know, Trump has allowed this impeachment to happen. He's stacked all these people around him with globalists, with communists, with Obama appointees, Clinton appointees, everything, and then he complains why he can't get things done and why they attack him.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  And he doesn't remove treasonous people like Nancy Pelosi or Ilhan Omar or any of these people who openly do things and nothing gets done about it. So I'm a little bit worried that we're focusing too much on impeachment.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  I know Trump has done nothing wrong. He hasn't committed any crimes and impeachment is total farce.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  But I think the more important thing here is, you know, not letting a good crisis go to waste, that sort of scenario where they're going to sneak in things, whether impeachment happens or not, we're focused on impeachment.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  And I think that we need to look at the long game for the Republic and for the nation and all these Republicans are up there talking about how they care about the Constitution, how it's a travesty.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  But honestly, they all sound like Lindsey Graham during the Kavanaugh hearing. He had his moment in the sun. He got to act all, you know, VA and be all good for the Trump supporter.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  But now that the impeachment is rolling around, his butt's on the line and he's like, no, no, don't do any witnesses. We can't handle that.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  No, I hear you. Absolutely. But we have come a long way. We've still got big problems. But here's an example. Here's what's in the bill right now.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  Afghan military gets three times the taxpayer funds as U.S. border wall and the U.S. is building border walls all the Middle East, but we can't build it here.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  That's the type of crap that's in the big spending bill right now.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  Heather Carlson's broken that down as well. Thank you. Great points, Ryan. More calls straight ahead. Christmas is here and it's time to give yourself, your family and your loved ones the gift of having incredible energy, stamina, focus, libido.

[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  So again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein. These things don't hang themselves on the front on the back. It's got info wars.com and shows the oh and info wars as a wreath. It's also a news. The system can't stand it when you promote things.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  The grassroots level. They can't stand it when you fund independent pro America pro human media. That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show defending the Republic from enemies far and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  All right, I've got clips of individuals on the house floor saying hang the president.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  If you were I said that about Obama, they would arrest us. These people are escalating things that's coming up start of the next hour continuing with your calls.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  And so much more here today.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  The war on Christmas is also heated up. I haven't even gotten to that. I didn't play the clip of Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch on Fox News saying Merry Christmas and mainline headlines like hate crime committed threw down the gauntlet rubbed it in our faces.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  Well now college official don't buy Christmas presents to fight climate change.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  These people are just sick. Going to a Christmas Carol Party and going and watching your children sing Christmas hymns at school as a revolutionary act now, we're under such attack.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  It's insane by this leftist cult.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Elissa in Oregon. Thank you for calling.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  Hey there Alex.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  The thing that we can do as a patriot movement to help out our president the most is like you said, get the word out.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  Because right now, information is our best weapon right now. If we do anything offensively they're going to twist anything that we do.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  What we can do is just educate, educate, educate. And that leads me to my suggestion. Maybe a suggestion for Savannah Hernandez.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  Because there's a lot of people who don't really speak English very well, but who need to hear what's really going on.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  So if we had the money, that's the first thing we do would be have a Spanish info wars and as many reporters as we can get. That's like probably after English, the dominant language on the planet and a 1 trillion percent.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  We'd love to do that.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  And if Savannah could just do a few reports on important issues, you know, kind of like John Bound or Greg Reese style videos that those would be really good to videos that we can send out to our family members.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  You know, I agree. We're trying to get her to be a reporter full time. She's in there helping run the show right now. That's how I mean, we're trying to expand the crew.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  And that's why I was like money, money, money, because it takes money and energy and time to do that. But we're almost there. We do want to have at least a couple hours a day of stuff in Spanish, take our main reports, translate them into that.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  Because that is, I mean, those folks are ready. They need to hear it. And it's fertile ground for liberty and freedom. And you're absolutely right.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  What do you make of the attempted coup against the president now entering, I guess, the third phase? And if they fail, I guess we'll just put up with another attempted coup. I mean, it's insane.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  They have been trying to get him out of office since before he even got elected, Alex. I mean, it's just been one attack after another.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  I'm honestly not surprised by any of this at this point. I mean, this is their most brazen attack.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  But we've been dealing with this since before Trump even got nominated. I mean, they tried to take the nomination away from him.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  They tried to keep him from, you know, getting, you know, they put up blockers to try and keep him from even being inaugurated. And it's just been one attack after another.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  Oh, yeah, they tried to, like, not let the delegates be seated. They tried to block families going in to the inauguration or beating them up in front of me and physically attack me.
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  And the DC police under orders didn't help. I mean, yeah, these are villains.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  So I'm honestly not surprised by any of this, but we just we got to keep praying for the president. That's the biggest thing we can do.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  Because if God is in control and we make sure that we allow God to work, then nothing that they do is going to work because God is in control.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  You're right. If we pray and we get active and we take action. Absolutely. Thank you so much for the call.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  You know, I was just having flashbacks to three years and three months ago, three years and two months ago, January 2017.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  And they had a big steel fence around the whole mall and it opened up at 8 a.m.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  And I didn't check where the VIP entrance was the mount ticket.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  I just said, I'll just I want to walk them all. I'm going to go in at one of the main entrances. There's like 10 of them.
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  So I started to get at the bottom was all blocked by Antifa beating people up in front of police, including families with children and people bleeding.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  We have video of it.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  And so I got pissed and with my security guys, we ran over a mob of them and the police ran over and threatened to arrest us.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  And I started just screaming at them. I said, I said, I know you're on orders to stand down, but shame on you. You let these damn families through here.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  And that hurt to go through a few more entrances. And then finally went to the very top one and there was all the.
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  And if it wasn't there because they had agreements with the police where they could be where the federal police were.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  What was the entrance for all the Congress people and everybody? Oh, if it wasn't there, just like in the documents we got two years ago from George Soros's operation, how they go to certain cities.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  They have agreements with police that they're allowed to commit the crimes in certain areas. It's all staged.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  And I just got so angry because it took me hours to get in.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  So I went, well, let's go try the top entrance. Then it was all border patrol running it and ice. They were all nice. And there was no lines that you just walk through.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  But the American people were being fed on by the DC police in league with the Antifa. That is something out of North Korea.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  These people are dangerous. We cannot let them get control of the country.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  I totally agree with you, ma'am. Thank you. God bless you. Merry Christmas.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  Kevin and Wyoming, thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead, Dustin, Bill and others.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  Alex Jones, I'd like to say first and foremost, long time listener, first time caller.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  And I think your name has been established before you were even on the air as a liberator of mankind.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Because your first name is Alex. That means liberator of mankind. Your last name is Jones.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  That means you've got an addiction to liberating mankind. God established you to do that before you even started the radio show.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  That's my first thing. Secondly, I wanted to say I don't think this impeachment is true.
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  I think it's under false pretenses. I think entirely that we can say it's not a real impeachment because there's not impeachable offence.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  And 2.5 years ago, they started the process when there was yet as yet nothing to impeach him for.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  And there was no due process in the process itself.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  So in Soviet Russia, they had power and they had show trials and those show trials, though there was power
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  and there was a consequence for the verdict of the false kangaroo court, they were not legitimate.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  They were lies in the same way. This impeachment is a lie. And here's the twist of what I'm saying.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  I'm not from Scotland. I sounded Scottish. I'm not. I said it that way because just as my fake Scotland was not real.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  This impeachment is a sham. That's what I wanted to say.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  Well, buddy, you're on fire. I want to go with you.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Why do you think they're power grabbing so hard even though it's blown up their face?
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  Because they want to cause a civil war and they're going to try to have the Supreme Court say that these Republican senators are partisan.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  When the whole thing is partisan, what else do you want to elaborate on? You sound like a smart guy.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  Well, thank you. God bless you. So I think that the link between all of these lies...
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  And you do a good Irish, I mean, a good Scottish voice too.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Oh, me, I can go into that right off the drop of a hat. It's the first one I learned, but I'm not...
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  Well, tell me this. Yeah, I'm a swamp donkey.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  That's today a swamp donkey. That's like, what was his name? The one who had the wee pug do the salute.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  I said the swamp donkey. That's great. But the whole wickedness we see right now, it's orchestrated in a spiritual way.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  It's spiritual wickedness in high places is what we are seeing right now perpetuated across the nation.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  We're seeing infernal influences that are directing these people. They're following their father the devil.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  Their son's a Belial. It says it in Scripture.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  In a way, I mean, I always knew this and it was true of spiritual experiences, no God's real.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  But you go out with Democrats now, man. They act like Linda Blair. I mean, it's happening to more and more people.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  It's being reported all over. People are going crazy. People are saying they're demons.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  I have people walk up to me in stores and all over and just go, I'm a demon and we're going to get you and your family.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  Satan's got the power, not you. There's a bunch of us. And it's like right out of the Bible.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  There's a bunch of you, huh? I mean, it's like literally right out of the Bible.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  Oh man, preachers of the choir, Alex, I'm a stand up comedian. I do jokes.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  I got on America's Got Talent last year, Google French accent, AGT. I do a one-liner thing with an accordion and I deal with them.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  I am in Southern California most of the year. I'm in Wyoming. It's where I'm from and I don't say I'm from California,
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  even though I've been out there for the last three years because I don't want to take that on myself.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  But I come back.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  We want you to host the show here. Like I said, I'm getting a bunch of names to start doing shows pretty much every day with callers.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  That's my next plan. So we want you to help us, but keep going.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  Oh, well, all I'm saying is I've been in ground zero fighting these people since I was in college.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  I was dumb when I was younger. I thought I'd be an actor. I didn't know what it meant.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  I'm from Wyoming. You know, give me a break, but I got my degree. I've got a talent God's given me.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  I can, I can, et cetera. Oh, thank you much.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  So point being, I've been dealing with it for a long time and I've had to deal with being blackballed from my beliefs before.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  And ironically, it's what led me to California to get on America's Got Talent.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  I did a, I was in Colorado and I got everybody mad because I'm conservative and they tried to kick me out of their venues.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  I said, well, I'm too big for your small town anyway. And I moonwalked my butt out to call California.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  Yeah. Well, your success is the fact is that you chose the right side in history.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  But listen, what's your, what's your handle again? French accent?
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  French accent. Yeah. You French accent comedian, French accent comic.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  I've got some clean stuff. I have done.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  Hey, hey, we'll be talking because I believe me. I always say if you want to get some done, we're going to do that show with the callers.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  I've already done some beta test weather. Thank you.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  Hour number three, your calls all straight ahead. Stay in attack formation.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  I've got a problem that I want to confess the listeners and viewers.
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story that changes the whole world.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  And that really does great things for the future of not just our children, but our children's children.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  Info wars really has changed history. And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot like me,
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  to really think about a world without info wars.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step to the plate and really financially support our broadcast going into 2020,
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  we're not going to be on the air in a year or so.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  If you do support us, we're not just going to stay on the air, but we are going to expand in ways that are going to blow you away.
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  I've never let you down. You've never let me down.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  Step up to the plate now. Go to infowarstore.com, buy great products and fund our operation and watch us make history together again.
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  Send in the clowns. Don't bother them.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  The globalists have sent in the clowns. They've sent in antifa. They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines. They've sent in their clowns.
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  Now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere and I'm so proud of info wars leading the charge.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:49.000]  The only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast and when you keep buying the great products at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:56.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  When I grow up, I want to overthrow the globalist and I've got a good start at it with your help. You are victory. You are the resistance. You are 1776.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  Think about it. You are the heart of the resistance. No matter where you live in the world, you love freedom, you love God, you love justice.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  You are the resistance to this world government satanic system.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  All right, I want to jam in more calls and then we've got a new video compilation.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  Loony Left celebrates the impeachment. It's all just a simulated victory. That's one reason they're doing it. Their supporters are so dumb.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  When I play this, I'll tell the story. You know, when they have private schools, public schools, they'll have big events where they all go to a big auditorium in the city and there'll be hours of Christmas carols and different performances.
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  So my daughter had been there for about 45 minutes before it started. My middle daughter. I'm already telling the story. I don't know. That's how I always do it.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  And she did her performance. It's a great job. We watched some more performances. She came out, sat with us. We left and she was like, oh my gosh, dad.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  It was all Trump's a criminal. He's going to be arrested tonight when he's impeached in court. That means he's guilty.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  And then she has an iPad with school and she wanted me to hear it. She's never recorded people in school.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:55.000]  She's like, here I am at lunch and she was recording the kids. I actually got recorded on my phone off the iPad at the school last night.
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  I was like, you hear these kids going, yeah, Trump's going to cause mass shootings in the schools. And then you hear another kid go, well, I'm really dumb, but all I know is Trump's evil.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  So it's just everywhere, public schools, private schools. It's just everywhere that they think Trump's been convicted.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  And this was at like, like six to seven, so it hadn't happened yet.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  I got done with that, drove home with her, had some quick dinner, called in on the show with Owen and Savannah doing a great job.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  And all the callers covered what was happening. We were on about 8.30 when it was all done with live extended coverage, but pretty amazing.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  Let's see how many one call and what's left of this segment and I'll come back with your calls and what I just mentioned on the other side.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  But it's, it's crazy. And then Democrat leaders calling for hanging Trump. So again, they mean business.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  Oh, a guy disagrees. I got to put him to have a line. Max in Wisconsin disagrees on Epstein. Go ahead.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  Hi, Mr. Jones. I'm a big fan of yours. And lately you've been framing Epstein and the Satanic Cabal as a CIA and Mossad honeypot scheme.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  Well, that's what I, that's what I think it is. Tell me what you think of this.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  I think that's part of it and a small percentage of it. But you've mentioned years ago, probably around 2010 to 2013.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  The sheer numbers, you know, Epstein himself said that he would have to satisfy himself at least like six to 10 times a day.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  The amount of people missing. And I'm in agreement of what you used to say that it seems that we're being harvested.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  More so than just a honeypot because, you know, how many, oh, I know they're killing kids too. Absolutely.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  They're only 16, 17 year old girls. Oh, Prince Andrew to kind of keep it at that. Instead of what's really going on.
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  Oh, I totally agree with you.
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  Okay. So you still believe that, you know, there's the, the harvesting is the main thing, you know, they, they walk all over us and they treat us that we're way beneath, you know, we're just a crop to them.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  Well, yeah, now the biggest export is children's blood out of the US. We're the biggest exporter of that. And so they're trying to make that all legal and lawful.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  So yeah, no, it's body parts. It's blood. They drink it. They also get infusions.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  Then it's just their whole religion is about using people, seeing everyone as animals. That's how they think they make themselves gods.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Really, it just makes them horrible, ugly, hunchback, you know, little self-assured demon creatures.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  But do you want to add more to this? How many don't don't hang up. Don't hang up because I've got the articles here.
[2:04:39.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  Where is it in my stack where Epstein now the video disappeared. You guys reprint that for me. I'm having trouble finding it.
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  Don't hang up, sir. I'll come back to you on that. That's subject when we come back in 60 seconds.
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  Most importantly, you counter the globalist by keeping info wars on the air.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  It's 60% off brain force plus right now. 30% off super blue singles and 50% off combo packs.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:35.000]  60% off the great sleep aid knockout. 60% off the ultimate tumor formula bodies.
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  60% off ultra 12. 60% off bio true selenium and up to 50% off the apparel.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  Take action now infowarstore.com. Make the decision to fund freedom and to fund your future.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  It is all in your hands. It's a total 360 win. Take action now infowarstore.com.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  President Trump was indicted by the House of Representatives for the political crime of trying to serve the American people and be faithful to his office and the execution of the Constitution.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  You don't need to know what the charges were, you already know.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  Construction of Congress, that means not bowing to the Nadler, looking at some feet, the Pelosi's, Bunions, and then of course, abuse of power, which is nebulous and whatever they want it to be.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  But it's the trap of the process once we're into that, of the civil unrest, of the leftists of the Supreme Court saying that it wasn't a real trial in the Senate, that's already all being done.
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  And so they do intend to try to remove him and it is a serious threat. I think it's a Hail Merriam anyways, but it's the journey, it's the destination, it's creating the division.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  But a caller just called in, Max in Wisconsin, says that Epstein's stuff is way worse than underage girls. Well, I've been saying that, because he disagrees with me that it's about harvesting organs, blood, all of this.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  Yeah, a lot of the women are actually there to go out and get younger girls and then they get even younger. So, I mean, it's definitely a club that is about hurting children.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  And human sacrifice is what is at the bottom of it. But surveillance footage outside of every Epstein's cell during suicide attempt is missing.
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  That's New York Daily News, assistant U.S. Attorney admitted nobody could find the footage.
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  Of course, the other cameras were turned off. I mean, give me a break, folks.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  They had a guy that was found with four dead bodies in his backyard, a huge cop that Epstein said tried to kill him a month before that.
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  And that gets swept under the rug. The media says, oh, no, he tried to kill himself then.
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  So, Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself. And that is a big awakening point for so many people. And now this just, it's more ridiculous.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  Max, go ahead and add other points. Where are you saying the Epstein rabbit hole goes? I mean, I said it was eugenics, secret breeding facilities, women as surrogates creating genetic clones for rich men.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  They believe that they'll have a neural interface later to be able to put their memories into that clone.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  Also, they believe they own those clones and so those people won't know that they're a clone and then they can later be killed and harvested.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  That's the type of stuff that I've read about and talked to people that said was going on. That was going on at Zorro Ranch.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  I said all this before that was ever in the news, years before, many years before.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  So, yeah, you name it, it's just mad scientist stuff. And what are mad scientists doing? Trying to play God always.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  Bill Gates runs the Kim trailing and geoengineering. He runs the gut flora study stuff while they attack that.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  I mean, they're just involved in everything. And he worked for Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  So, they want total control of our children. That's it. Bill and Melinda Gates for control of education, the training, teaching, the pedophile training.
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  There's big articles where Wells Fargo and under Warren Buffett's teaching all that to the kids, paying schools to teach those curriculum, to teach political correctness.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  I mean, these are very evil men. So, I pretty much said what the bottom of the rabbit hole is. This was a corporate intelligence operation at the top compromising men with underage girls.
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  And then as they tested people, getting them deeper into the black hole, which they invert.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  So, for them, it is a pyramid. Does that make sense? But really, it's going down a black hole into hell.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  It totally makes sense. And you've been very prescient on it. I just think that the intelligence aspect is just a small portion.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  And you would talk about in 2013, even about how it would end up in a situation where we are now where it's giant, mega globalist groups fighting against each other in the middle class in the middle.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  But another thing that I would appoint that I haven't heard you bring up is regarding Elon Musk's dad.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  Do you know what I'm talking about there?
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  Well, tell me the specifics.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  Well, do you know anything about Elon Musk's dad?
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  I know something. Tell me what you want to get into.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  Well, I'm not against technology. I like the stuff. Obviously, electric cars are cool and rocket ships and all that.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  But I don't like it when you're right because you're right about bad things like we're getting poisoned.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  You know, one thing I don't want you to be right about is about or, you know, it's been mentioned on your shows about there being marred sex slave colonies.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  And I didn't say that.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  Yeah, I didn't say you said it. It was not it. Someone else said it on your show. You had to catch that.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  But Elon Musk's dad Arrow must married his married and had a child with his stepdaughter after remarrying. She was very young.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  Not one not only when they had the step, not only when they had a kid together, but when he initially became her stepfather, I believe she was only four.
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  And, you know, you can't blame the sins of the father on the son.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  A lot of Elon is is that name comes from a Werner von Braun book about Martians taken over, basically.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  So it's really weird stuff. And obviously it's space cult stuff. That's what all of this goes back to is people trying to play God, where we really come from.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  And then they take a lot of drugs. He's trying to get in contact interdimensionally with the aliens. I mean, that's what they're believing.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  I'm not saying that's what I've seen or what I believe. I mean, that's what's going on with these people.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  And the Bible says people take these hardcore drugs, sorcerers, to make contact with these beings beyond the veil.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  And I know scientists and people that have gone and taken ayahuasca with 30, 40, 50 people.
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  I know talk show husband and they'll all see the same creatures appear and talk to them.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  So it's not a it's not a you don't have group hallucinations and all see the same thing.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  Okay, there it's the veil that the Bible talks about is is lifted and you see other dimensions.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  There's a reason our site only can see so much, which they've proven with dark matter and quantum mechanics and all the numbers.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  Now, there's much stronger stuff around us is we can't handle it.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  I mean, you couldn't handle seeing all the other not just the way we see dimensions, but fractal dimensions and permutation and sub dimensions, artificial dimensions.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  And just all the things that have been created in creation.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  I mean, imagine how it is for autistic children.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  A lot of folks say the damage has actually opened up the cerebral cortex.
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  It's more than just like because there's so much information coming in.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  It's like a dog can hear a dog whistle. You can.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  Well, some humans can. My grandmother could drive her crazy.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  But, you know, that's what it is.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  I would just ask you to look in the arrow box. His name is arrow. He was also apparently a rumor has it using slaves for mining emerald.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  And I just wish, you know, I have nothing wrong with South Africa.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  Listen, I don't trust, I don't trust Elon Musk as far as you can throw him. God bless you.
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  And I appreciate your call. I got to move on.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  But I really appreciate you.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  Let me go out to break with this piece that Darren McGreen put together.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  I hope he puts it out on Twitter somewhere so I can promote it.
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  It's a great video. I need to always be given all to say this on air a sheet where it is.
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  I can point listeners to it to share it.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  But we'll try to post it on info wars.com.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  We'll get it posted to Bandot video. There it is.
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  They did it. See, wow, Darren's even better than I thought.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  Well, son of a bitch, a Trump supporter gets Joe Biden's face and it's awesome.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  No, that's a that's another video.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  But let's just go out to break with the latest one he's put out here.
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  And that's again, leftist.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  Loons celebrate Trump impeachment.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  But of course, they're nonpartisan when they celebrate and.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  Ilhan Omar and the rest of them go.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  Oh, how much?
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  Yeah, Durga, Durga, Durga, Durga, Durga, Durga, Durga, Durga, Durga. Here you go.
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  I am on my way to United States House floor.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  To impeach President Trump.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  Article one is adopted.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  The question is on the adoption of article two.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  The question is on the adoption of article two.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  Those in favor say aye.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  Those opposed nay.
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  I have it.
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  He's in trouble.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  It's a sad day.
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  Sad.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  It's impeachment day.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  Impeachment.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  Oh, this is greatest, greatest, greatest, greatest, greatest Christmas present ever.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  Time to rub one out.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  The House of Representatives voted to impeach a sitting president, Donald J. Trump.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  There it is.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  We don't ever want another racist, sexist, xenophobic, Russian puppet to sit in that White House ever, ever again.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  The blue cess pitch is needed a fake victory, but they want to leverage it into civil war.
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  We don't ever want another racist, sexist, xenophobic, Russian puppet to sit in that White House ever, ever again.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  We don't ever want another racist, sexist, xenophobic, Russian puppet to sit in that White House ever, ever again.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  We don't ever want another racist, sexist, xenophobic, Russian puppet to sit in that White House ever, ever again.
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  We don't ever want another racist, sexist, xenophobic, Russian puppet to sit in that White House ever, ever again.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  We don't ever want another racist, sexist, xenophobic, Russian puppet to sit in that White House ever, ever again.

[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  I'm not playing around. I'm not screwing around.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  I'm not joking and neither are you.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  Info wars and this operation we built together has delivered for America, has delivered for our children and the unborn,
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  delivered in the face of toxic fluoride and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  What we're doing is beyond critical.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  And you hear the key word? What we are doing is beyond critical.

[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  I'm going to wake up today. You know, I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier and richer.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me.
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  I want to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to info wars.com.

[2:19:53.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  It plays bad and the turbo force is good.
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  Alright, we're going to your phone calls right now.
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  Here on the air broadcasting worldwide.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Then I'm going to get to some of these clips I was just mentioning.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:59.000]  That to tie into the lawlessness and the calls for violence.
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  We're hearing from the craze left and their globalist funders and controllers
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  that have used America's open free society against us.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  Right now, let's see who's been holding the longest.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  And that would be Joe.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  In New York. Thank you for calling today. Welcome.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing today? Good.
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  In my opinion, I think what Trump needs to do is needs to declare a state of emergency
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  and activate the United States Marine Corps.
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  They do not need congressional authorization for 30 days anywhere in the world.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  And he needs to arrest these people and for committing espionage and treason against
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  the American people with their attempted coup against the American government.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:46.000]  And by the way, I'm Mr. Interpolice State.
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  But a police state would be what they're doing, trying to overthrow an election
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  and arrest people who've done nothing wrong.
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  And that is the response that in England or anywhere in history that have been
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  quote free countries, this is what you do.
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  If a bunch of people are working with foreign powers to say the elected leaders bad
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  and remove them and are trying to crash the stock market and saying we want to
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  to make the people behave, that's economic warfare.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  That's treason. And you're damn right. These people need to have trials, though.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  They need to have trials. And instead, though, everybody's paralyzed
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  by the out of control misbehavior of the Democrats.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  And so they've escalated. We're not escalating to meet it.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  And it may backfire on them and destroy them forever, but then they just keep doubling down
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  and doubling down and doubling down until if this impeachment fails in the Senate,
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  if the removal fails, how are they going to escalate after this?
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  I have no idea. I just can only imagine them going further and further
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:55.000]  until they can. We have to stand up to them or they're not going to be stopped.
[2:22:55.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  They're just going to keep going until we're done.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:06.000]  But how does the president get up there? He needs to start having nighttime chats
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  with American people for like an hour, not just rallies. Those are great, too.
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  And just say, hey, they're doing this. Hey, they're saying they want to hang me.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  Hey, they're working for the Chai comms. Here's where all these senators
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  have Chinese agents, literal communists on their payroll.
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  And then Trump starts saying, what do I do? What do you want me to do?
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  I think he has to do it that way. And I think if he just did that, they might back down.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  The fact that they haven't been indicted, the fact that they get away with everything,
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  is only encouraging this behavior. What do you think?
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  I think that you're exactly right, Alex. You hit the nail on the head.
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  They're not going to stop until we force them to stop.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  Thank you, Joe. God bless you.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  All right, Bill in South Dakota, you're on the air worldwide.
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:54.000]  As in the last days of Noah, evil will be swept upon this world.
[2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  What is considered good is evil and evil is good.
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  That's the times that we're living in now.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  And I do believe that like the left and everybody else out there
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  is spiritually blinded to the good.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  Satan is running around this world right now like you wouldn't believe,
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  devouring up everything that he possibly can.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  And I think he's left, especially the left.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  They're just falling into illusion that God has, as you said in the Bible.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  How are you doing, Alex?
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  I agree with you, sir.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  And our biggest task is to be focused and to be at peace with God,
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  but to be actively against the corruption and just pray for peace in our own lives.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  Because I got to tell you, I'm more angry in person.
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  Everybody I know that's a patriot is really upset and we should be.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  Evil's gone on too long, but we can't get so angry.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  You ever had like hunting dogs and you're about to dump them out of the back of a truck
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  and you're about to go chase down some wild hogs.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  And those dogs love each other.
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  But sometimes they'll start biting each other.
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  Just in the frenzy to get on the attack.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  You've got to just be zen doubt about this.
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  And that doesn't mean submit to the tyranny.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  It just means we have got to be focused and very calm about this to carry this out
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  in a very judicious way.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  Does that make sense?
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  Yes.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  And you know, I've been a listener since 2015.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  And especially when Obama, after Obama's office,
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  but real quick here, a long story short,
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  I always had a feeling about this government deep state was all corrupt, you know,
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:39.000]  and I think you might have helped produce loose change if I'm correct or not.
[2:25:39.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  But I actually live in Northeast Iowa and that, you know,
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  we had a copy of that going around and around and around,
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  which confirmed my suspicions of the government.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  And, you know, like Dr. Howard, Reverend Dr. Howard Brown,
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  he goes up to the Congress and he does a revival up there on the Congress.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  Well, I think you should team up with him and all of us patriots.
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  Now I go up there and spread the word of the gospel,
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  but also expose these sons of a, you know what, straight out.
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  No, sons of goblins, you're absolutely right, Bill.
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  You're absolutely right.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  We need to wake up and start rejecting evil.
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  Thank you, Bill.
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  Bill's always like, oh, just tolerate me, show your nice, be friendly with me.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  And if it's a lifestyle twice, I'm the type of guy that's like, yeah, okay.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  But then they always want more and more and more and more until they're telling me how to live
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  and me what to say and what words I can use.
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  No, I will not be your slave.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  All right, up next is Al in California.
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  Thanks for holding it on the air.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  Hello?
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  First off, I want to say God bless Alex Jones.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  Well, God bless Al in California.
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  My God, you have changed my life.
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  TurboForce has changed my life.
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  I was red-pilled in 2016, largely in part because of you.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  I started buying your products about a year ago.
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:09.000]  You've got bodies, super silver, super silver for your teeth, red-pilled plus red-pilled.
[2:27:09.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  You've changed my life.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  What I really want to say, first off, I'm an artist.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  I was born and raised in the Kansas City area, but I moved to Northern California in 2011.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  I've been social networking since 1987, and the information warfare is exactly where we need to be.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  I had an idea for a t-shirt, which is why I called.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  It would show, it would be a picture of Anne Frank holding an AR or another kind of gun,
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  and the caption would say, Anne Frank needed a gun.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  They've hijacked our women, and we need women to...
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  I totally agree.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  We need women to identify with being strong and empowered and not slaves of the globalists.
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  That's a great idea.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  Anne Frank needed a gun on the front, on the back.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  Don't let dictators take your guns, and you're absolutely right.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  That's a great idea, sir.
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  A large part of why I was red-filled in 2016 is I got tired of being weaponized and feminized.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  I see all of this is what's going on as a singularity.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  We are headed for a black hole, and what happens with black holes is they either stay a black hole or they explode.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  What's going on is they're trying to create an explosion.
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  All this name-calling, demonization, censorship, shadow banning, gun conversation, doxing, mob rule, socialism, communism,
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  collectivism is all singularity and it's all fascism.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  Brother, call back again.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  The only way I get great calls like you on is to take more, and I'm doing a good job today.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  We're taking a lot of calls.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  The crew's doing a kick-ass job as well, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  The only way that the videos get out of here.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  We have listeners, men and women, who bleed red blood, who are part of the human race of every color, of every creed,
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  who understand that evil is launching its full attack upon humanity now,
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  and who are ready to stand and fight against the global scourge.
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  And I need all of you to realize that you're the best we've got.
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:22.000]  Infowars is the best we've got. We're not perfect, but we're fighting hard.

[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  Not just to expand in the face of the enemy, but just to stay on air.

[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:02.000]  The globalists think America's done. The globalists think that the West has done.
[2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:06.000]  They think that Christians are done and finished. They believe they've broken our backs.
[2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  They believe that with big tech censorship, we'll just crawl into dishes and submit to them.
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:14.000]  And they believe that if they can demonize and shut down infowars,
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:18.000]  that they rightfully see as a symbol, a beacon of populism and freedom,
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  not just to America, but to the whole world, that they can demoralize everybody else and win.
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  Why? If they can shut infowars down, they can intimidate everybody else.
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:29.000]  That's why it's beyond critical that you keep infowars on the air.
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:33.000]  It's only by your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support that we're on air.
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:37.000]  And I want to thank you all this Christmas for your past support.
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  But I want to encourage you now to redouble your efforts and financially support us
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  by getting great products you need during the 12 days of Christmas at infowarsstore.com.

[2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  Please take action now towards Soros. Hope you don't.
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  Infowars has delivered.
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  Infowars has come through time and time and time and time again.
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  At that critical game-changing moment, we have come through.
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  And that means myself, the other hosts, the journalists, the researchers, the writers,
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  the crew, down to the janitor, down to the bookkeeper.
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  There is no top, there is no bottom. We are a family in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  And the stakes have never been higher.
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  That's why the Globals want to take us out of the game.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  Only you keep Infowars in the game. You are the Infowar.
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  And now, this Christmas, and come up to the end of the year,
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  is the time to spend your money at infowarsstore.com to fund us into this next critical year of 2020
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:49.000]  while getting great products that make your life and your family's life a lot better.
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:57.000]  Huge sales right now. Now's the time to shop at infowarsstore.com.
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:05.000 --> 2:33:18.000]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:25.000]  Even more clear last night when Speaker Pelosi suggested that House Democrats may be too afraid,
[2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:31.000]  too afraid to even transmit their shoddy work product to the Senate.
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  Mr. President, it looks like the prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country.
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  And second, guessing whether they even want to go to trial.
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  They said impeachment was so urgent that it could not even wait for due process, but now they're content to sit on their hands.
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  This is really comical.
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  Democrats' own actions concede that their allegations are unproven.
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  The articles aren't just unproven, they're also constitutionally incoherent.
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  Incoherent.
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  Frankly, if either of these articles is blessed by the Senate, we could easily see the impeachment of every future president of either party.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  Let me say that again.
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  If the Senate blesses this historically low bar, we will invite the impeachment of every future president.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  The House Democrats' allegations, as presented, are incompatible with our constitutional order.
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  They're unlike anything that's ever been seen in 230 years of this republic.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  House Democrats want to create new rules for this president because they feel uniquely enraged.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  They feel uniquely enraged.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  But long after the partisan fever of this moment has broken, the institutional damage will remain.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  I've described the threat to the presidency.
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  This also imperils the Senate itself.
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  The House has created an unfair, unfinished product that looks nothing, nothing like any impeachment inquiry in American history.
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  And if the speaker ever gets her house in order, that mess will be dumped over here on the Senate's lap.
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  If the Senate blesses this slapdash impeachment, if we say that from now on this is enough, then we invite an endless parade of impeachable trials.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  Future Houses of either party will feel free to toss up a jump ball every time they feel angry.
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  Free to swamp the Senate with trial after trial, no matter how baseless the charge is.
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  We'd be giving future Houses of either party unbelievable new power to paralyze the Senate at their whim.
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  More than arguments, more incomplete evidence, more partisan impeachments.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  In fact, Mr. President, this same House of Representatives has already indicated that they themselves may not be finished impeaching.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  The House Judiciary Committee told the federal court this very week that it will continue its impeachment investigation even after voting on these articles.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  And multiple Democratic members have already called publicly for more.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  If the Senate blesses this, if the nation accepts this, presidential impeachments may cease being a once in a generation event and become a constant part, a constant part of the political background noise.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  This extraordinary tool of last resort may become just another part of the arms race of polarization.
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  Real statesmen would have recognized, no matter their view of this President, that trying to remove him on this thin and partisan basis could unsettle the foundations of our Republic.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  Real statesmen would have recognized, no matter how much partisan animosity might be coursing through their veins, that cheapening the impeachment process was not the answer.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  Historians will regard this as a great irony of our era.
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  That so many who profess such concern for our norms and traditions themselves proved willing to trample our constitutional order to get their way.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  It is long past time for Washington to get a little perspective.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  President Trump is not the first President with a populist streak, not the first to make entrenched elites uncomfortable.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  He's certainly not the first President to speak bluntly, to mistrust the administrative state, or to rankle unelected bureaucrats.
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  Heaven knows he's not the first President to assert the constitutional privileges of his office, rather than roll over when Congress demands unlimited, sensitive information.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  None of these things, none of them, is unprecedented.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  I'll tell you what would be unprecedented. It will be an unprecedented constitutional crisis if the Senate literally hands the House of Representatives a new partisan vote of no confidence.
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  That the Founders intentionally withheld destroying the independence of the Presidency.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  It will be unprecedented if we agree that any future House that dislikes any future President can rush through an unfair inquiry, skip the legal system, and paralyze the Senate with a trial.
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  The House could do that, it will, under this precedent.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  It will be unprecedented if the Senate says second-hand and third-hand testimony from unelected civil servants is enough to overturn the people's vote.
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  It will be an unprecedented constitutional crisis if the Senate agrees to set the bar this low forever.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  It is clear what this moment requires. It requires the Senate to fulfill our founding purpose.
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:25.000]  The Framers built the Senate to provide stability, to take the long view of our Republic.
[2:40:25.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  To safeguard institutions from the momentary hysteria that sometimes consumes our politics. To keep partisan passions from literally boiling over.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  The Senate exists for moments like this.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  That's why this body has the ultimate say in impeachments.
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  The Framers knew the House would be too vulnerable to transient passions and violent factionalism.
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  All right, we've got loaded phones, I've got tons of news.
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  They needed a body.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  But I thought we really should play this because it was a powerful speech, the full speech.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  It's about half of it, it's on infowars.com.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  We'll go to break soon, come back with more of your calls, and then Savannah Hernandez is going to be in studio.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  Identify the woman that assaulted her and her camera lady, our great reporter, and the camera person, and it just illustrates what's going on there.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  Matt Bracken is coming up, and then of course the war with Owen Schreuer.
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  But talking about the lawlessness, here is the majority whip Democrat James Clyburn talking about hanging the president. Here it is.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  We would be crazy to walk in there knowing he set up a kangaroo court.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  How long are you willing to wait?
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  As long as it takes.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  Even if he doesn't come around to commit into a fair trial, keep those articles here.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  So keep it as long as it takes.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  If you know, and he's told you what he's going to do, let's give him a fair trial and hang him.
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  So you heard that.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  Let's give him a fair trial and hang him, but they're going to hold back the articles because the Senate isn't going to railroad the president like the House did.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  These people are out of control just rejecting any due process.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  Going out to break, here's a clip of Brennan recently saying, get rid of due process. It's chilling. Here it is.
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  You know, people are innocent until, you know, alleged to be involved in some type of criminal activity.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  People are innocent until, you know, alleged to be involved in some type of criminal activity.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  People are innocent until, you know, alleged to be involved in some type of criminal activity.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  Well, an incredibly authoritarian statement will be back.
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:43:01.000]  So what's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist? The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegor.
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  Turboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system, the capitalism of a human.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  Some people get 15 hours out of this. Some people get about 8 hours.
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:24.000]  But people take this, people are taking sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts. You can call us whatever you want.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  It's a total solution all around the best you're going to find.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  Turboforce, without you, we don't roll. With you, we search forward together.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:43.000]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind? It's a win-win, 360-together, infowarstore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  To compromise world leaders, they do not want this story continuing.
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  And this is your last chance to get the limited edition Christmas sweater at infowarstore.com to help spread the word, to have a piece of history, and to fund our operation.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  So, again, it says Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein, that these things don't hang themselves on the front.
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  On the back, it's got infowars.com and shows the O in infowars as a wreath that's also a noose.
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  The system can't stand it when you promote things at the grassroots level.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  They can't stand it when you fund independent pro-America, pro-human media.
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  That's why you've got to take advantage of this shirt and get it today at infowars.com.
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  It's 65% off right now.
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  That's very close to cost with a free bottle of our best-selling Biotru Selenium for the mustard seed.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:33.000]  These two formulas go together and will supercharge your energy, your focus, your entire body.
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  The globalists know about this, but have been suppressing it.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  Take advantage of it now, the Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus combo at Biotru Selenium at infowarstore.com and help yourself, your family, and the infowar.
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  Again, do your Christmas shopping for yourself and your family.
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  You need to try the Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus and Biotru Selenium for yourselves.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  I'm here to give the listeners of yours a project report in the next 60 seconds.
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  And here's the bottom line.
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  I'm not playing around, I'm not screwing around, I'm not joking, and neither are you.
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  Infowars and this operation we built together has delivered for America, has delivered for our children and the unborn, has delivered in the face of toxic fluoride and the GMOs and the deadly vaccine depopulation operation.
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  What we're doing is beyond critical.
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  And do you hear the key word?
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  What we are doing is beyond critical.
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  So, this is the time with the biggest sales ever during Christmas at infowarstore.com to get in there and buy these products that you already need, that I need the funding for to get this operation to the next level.
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  I need the money.
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:49.000]  I need to be able to fight the globalist.
[2:46:49.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  I need you.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:51.000]  You need these products.
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  Get them at infowarstore.com.
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:38.000]  We are back live, and you know, I don't normally play clips back to back, but this is the majority whip in the house, the underling, the aid to camp to Nancy Kripkeper Pelosi saying we're not going to send articles of impeachment to the Senate,
[2:47:38.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  because we're going to tell them what their rules are, is if the Senate can tell the House, and the House broke all the rules.
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  So, you're just seeing an arrogant, hateful run.
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  And then he says, and once he gets his fair trial, we're going to hanging, which can be taken two ways.
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  Metaphorically, like once we railroad him with our fair trial, we approve that House managers control Pelosi demands.
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  Might as well wear a black mask, like executioners will hang, or it's a literal threat, which of course it's both.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  You know, Trump tweeted, it's like Guatemalan justice, what Schiff's doing.
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  This is completely, and Schiff's like, you're threatening me.
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  How's Ed Buck doing their old, old Schiff?
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  Here's that clip if you missed it.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  We would be crazier to walk in there knowing he's set up a kangaroo court.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  How long are you willing to wait?
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  As long as it takes.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  Even if he doesn't come around to commit into a fair trial, keep those articles here.
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  So keep it as long as it takes.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  If you know, and he's told you what he's going to do, let's give him a fair trial and hang him.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  Everybody's so tough talking about killing and hanging and rioting and burning and leveling the Trump supporters and finding them where they live and getting them.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  You guys better watch out.
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  The fight you're looking for, you might just find it.
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  Oh, I know.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  You think somebody else is going to fight that fight?
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  These aren't going to be like wars of the past if these people get their wish.
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  But psychopaths always got to get their ass handed to them before they find out how the cow ate the cabbage.
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  This is not going to be the cabbage eating the cow.
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  All these little leftist hunchbacks that can hardly tie their shoelaces preyed on America while we were asleep.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  That's not the case anymore, is it?
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  And you know this article about how the government says, oh, we don't know where the video of Epstein's first attempted suicide went because it wasn't the guy who was trying to kill him.
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  That's what the other people said in the other jail cells around it, what Epstein said.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  But the fact that they had to kill him and then disappear all the evidence just shows it's not the full government doing it.
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  It's being done by ragtag inside groups very haphazardly, very ham fistedly.
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  That shows panic right there, which is good.
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  It shows that they're not in charge anymore to a great extent, but it's also dangerous because they're out of control.
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  Somebody needs to stop them, and we've got indictments for all of them.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  They're all flagrantly criminal.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  Son of a bitch, you investigate my son, I'll have you fired in six hours.
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  You don't get a billion dollars and son of a bitch, he was fired.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  They're all like thugs, Richard Haas, the other see apart goes, oh, that's really tough.
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  Committing the crimes in the open.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  And then projecting it onto Trump.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:11.000]  Okay, here's the callers, Jim, Chad, Nelson, Joseph, Jefferson, Stephanie, Josh, George.
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:19.000]  I'm going to go to Jim, whose law enforcement was talking about China connection, then to Joseph and Ireland and others, like Stephanie.
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  Thanks for holding your on the air, Jim.
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  How you doing?
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  Man, I tell you, I'm like I stuck my finger in a light socket.
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  I'm like, I'm going to be wired and awake. This is historic stuff right now.
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  Well, it truly is. It truly is.
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  And when you start looking around, especially living here and working here with what I do, it is scary.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  Some of the things you see and makes me want to move.
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:47.000]  That's for sure.
[2:51:47.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  Oh, yeah, California. California.
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  I mean, if you have a big earthquake, LA is 20 million people that whole corridor.
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  My God, sir, that's day of the dead. That's that's that's into the world stuff.
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  You know, I hope it doesn't happen. But, you know, it's going to be one thing that would clean up a big mess to get to my point.
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  That was, I don't know if you remember, but the second that Trump was elected, the last governor of the state of California spent a week over in China with Gigi Ping on his knees in front of him.
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  I remember that. I remember that.
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  Ask yourself why. And now who here is pushing all this? Well, let's see.
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  The Queen of the North, who is a good Catholic.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:31.000]  Pelosi.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  Hanks out with all the pedophiles, the and the King of the South. And if you, they both run both into the state.
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  Did you know that within, well, within the United States of America, something needs to change.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  It never has the only state where you don't do or the only country you don't have to be a citizen to own the property.
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  You not only do the Chinese own all the.
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  The.
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  What is the studio's, but you know that.
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  Well, in the 90s, when they got rid of the Port of Long Beach, which was a naval port.
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:12.000]  Bill Clinton handed that only deep water port on the West Coast directly to the CHICOM government.
[2:53:12.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  Right. And they turned it into a container port and it's there.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:18.000]  So they own that one. Do you know that?
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  Was it a year and a half, two years ago?
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  Right before Obama left, I guess it would have been.
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  He did. They did the Port of Oakland. Same thing. Yes.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  To make all kinds of jobs.
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  So let's see here. They own both deep water ports.
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  They got rid of, as part of that, they got rid of all of the military along the coast, except San Diego in the south.
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:44.000]  Way south, which there's supposedly reports of.
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  Chinese plenty of Chinese hardware just on the other side of the border and.
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  Oh, let's be on that. You got the Chinese having subs pop up and firing.
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  Trident missile copies. The Clinton gave them right over California.
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  Right. And so just imagine if they just pulled up into the deep water port.
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  How far could they lob them inland? How long would it take to evade the whole state?
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  And look into the standard hotel, which is in shift district.
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  You're going to find all kinds of crazy pedophile slave stuff going on out of that place.
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  And, you know, nobody would sell your country out in the communist Chinese.
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  Absolute degenerates who create their own club and who take over.
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:28.000]  And that's what California is. And they love it.
[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  They love the homeless, the needles, the pedophilia, all of it.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  You think one look at chef? I mean, that is a turd gobbler right there.
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  And I was looking at something when Pelosi did her thing about hate.
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  You know, I've been a, I'm actually a baptized minister as well.
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  And I looked at, I started reading about hate and I found something very interesting.
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  I mean, it's short or tell Daria to get her Bible.
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  But it talks about how God, what God hates.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  Yeah. And the first thing it starts with is, let's see here, it starts with,
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:07.000]  there are six things that Jehovah hate show, by the way, is his name in English.
[2:55:07.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  Yes, seven things that he detests, a haughty, haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart plotting, where is it?
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  They lost it. A heart that, and if you look at these globalists,
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  they always have that look on their eyes like they're winning.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  They're so powerful. They're enjoying it.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  Those are haughty eyes and men have them too.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  And the demon possessed people always have those eyes like they're going to get you.
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  It's funny and they're real cynical and you're a piece of filth.
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  Absolutely. Notice that was misinterpreted out of the Hebrew.
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  Thou shalt not kill.
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  That says thou shalt not murder.
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  But that passage again says innocent blood.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  Innocent blood means killing people that didn't attack you.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  Killing people that didn't need killing who were hurting innocent people.
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  The whole Bible is full of God saying these people are devil worshipers
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  that give their kids to human sacrifice.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  I want them all dead. Kill them.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  And I'm not saying go out and start killing people.
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:07.000]  I'm just telling you what the Bible says.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  When it's time to go to war, God says wipe them out.
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  Is that not the Bible?
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  Yeah, it says the heart plotting, wicked schemes, and feats that run quickly to evil.
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  And here's the best one, a false witness that lies with every breath.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:24.000]  Now remember, these are things that God hates.
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  Read those slowly again.
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  All actions.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  Read those from top to bottom again.
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  I was interrupting. Read them from top to bottom.
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  That's good. Top to bottom.
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  Six things.
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  It says this says, yes, there's seven things that he detests.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  Hotty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:46.000]  a heart plotting, wicked schemes, and feet that run quickly to evil,
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  and a false witness who lies with every breath.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  And anyone sowing contentions among brothers.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  So you look at what they're doing, and that is almost exactly.
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  Brother, you just nailed them.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  We love you, Jim.
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  Get his name, too, for the show.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:06.000]  We're gonna start having shows with the callers.
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  All right, I'll try to get to everybody.
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  I love you. We've gotten a lot of calls.
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  It's been a good job today, I think, overall.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  Savannah Hernandez, everybody's coming in at five after.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  I'll take a few more when we come back.
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  Quick, quick, quick.
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  That little short segment.
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  Please don't forget.
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  Almost forgot the sour.
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  It's Christmas time.
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  It's when we normally find ourselves the next year.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  We're not selling as much products as we sold last year.
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  We're getting behind here.
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  Folks, these are great products.

[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  Huge deals, infowarstore.com.

[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  My fault, my fear.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  I thought that you would want what I want.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:59.000]  I'm sorry, my dear.
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:04.000]  But where are the clowns?
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  Sending the clowns.
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:15.000]  Don't bother there.
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  The globalists have sent in the clowns.
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  They've sent in antifa.
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:27.000]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:29.000]  They've sent in their clowns.
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:34.000]  But now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:37.000]  And I'm so proud of info wars leading the charge.
[2:58:37.000 --> 2:58:41.000]  The only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:46.000]  and when you keep buying the great products at infowarstore.com.
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:50.000]  We're closing out the year 2019.
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:53.000]  I don't have to tell you that 2020 is going to be a maker to break it.
[2:58:53.000 --> 2:58:56.000]  Not just for info wars, not just for America, but the whole world.
[2:58:56.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  We are in a battle between the forces of globalism that want to post human world
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:02.000]  and those that want to pro human world.
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  We're in a fight between Satan and Christ.
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:07.000]  And it's being played out amongst us mortals.
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  But it's being directed from on high.
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  And I'm just telling the listeners this broadcast.
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:16.000]  Without you, we're going to lose this fight.
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:20.000]  I need all of you to realize how important you are and how important info wars is
[2:59:20.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  and what we've done together.
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:25.000]  And just take stock and take measure at the end of the year
[2:59:25.000 --> 2:59:27.000]  and think about what you're going to do.
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  Whether it's supporting info wars and buying products from us or starting your own show.
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:33.000]  Just whatever you do, take action now.
[2:59:33.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  History is happening.
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:37.000]  Please do your Christmas shopping.
[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:39.000]  Please do your new year shopping.
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:41.000]  And infowarstore.com, we've got the best products.
[2:59:41.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  You're only helping the globalists if you don't do it. Thank you.
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  What we're witnessing right now is riveting.
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  And it's also incredibly dangerous.
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  History.
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  The confluence of all these different things lining up.
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  And evil is going to get wild.
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  It's going to get dangerous.
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  It's going to get really cartoonish too.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  And a lot of nasty stuff is going to happen.
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  And the way it always goes, it's all synced up,
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  is you're going to have natural disasters in leftist areas.
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  It's going to be bad.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  I mean, devastation.
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  I would expect to come.
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  And I think large parts of California are gone within two years.
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  It's just, God's not going to pull up with it.
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  And I think you're going to see, I think Pelosi will have a stroke
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  in the next year.
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:18.000]  I think Ginsburg will be dead within six months.
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  And I don't take pleasure in any of this.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  I'm just telling you, that's what I'm seeing.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  And I would pray to God to bring judgment upon them.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  Vengeance is mine, say, at the Lord.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  Now, sometimes God will use humans to carry out the vengeance.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  But let's let God decide.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  And that's really what it comes down to.
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  That's a chicken or the egg, though, isn't it?
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:52.000]  Kill them all at God's sort of amount.
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  I'm like, you're there killing everybody, so God must have wanted it to happen.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  No, it's a free will thing.
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  Evil people do bad things, God doesn't want that.
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  That's what sin is.
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  We're going to phone calls right now.
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  Joseph in Ireland, thanks for calling.
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  You're on the air.
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  What do you think about this very dangerous fiasco?
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  Alex, if you're coming to flesh out what I want,
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  what you're talking about there in Alaska before us,
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  is exactly what I wanted to talk about.
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  But I wanted to put it to the Bible.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  Who is the dragon?
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  The dragon is Satan, but what country on earth is represented by the dragon?
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  China, the red dragon.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  Who's got your president on trial?
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  Xi Jinping.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  He represents the red dragon.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  Now, what comes out of the red dragon's mouth?
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  Vomit.
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:42.000]  And who controls the media?
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  China.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  And it's Hollywood is the powerful media here now.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  Nobody gives a damn about CNN.
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  What comes out of that mouth?
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  Vomit.
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:52.000]  That's the way God sees it.
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  And your president is on trial because he's blocking the New World Order.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  And China brags.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  The Washington Post says,
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  Xi Jinping must destroy Trump to save America.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:10.000]  I mean, they're openly for dictatorship that's killed 100 million people.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  Well, Alex, this is biblical.
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  You know, he's blocking the One World Order.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  Since he went into the UN and said,
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  I will not go for globalism. They have gone full,
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  every torpedo has been launched at him.
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  Now, why?
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  Because this is the false Pope, who is, I believe,
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  is the false prophet named in the Bible.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  This is the times we're living in.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:35.000]  Okay.
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  He is behind this as well because the One World Religion must be brought in.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  False One World Religion.
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  The One World Bank and a One World Government.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  It will happen.
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  Trump is standing in the way.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  And California will go down. Yes, absolutely.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  I have no doubt about that.
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  And the World War II will happen.
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  You can't slaughter millions and millions of children.
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  And the judgment of God will come on every country.
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  Because every country is killing their children.
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  And that's why he's happening here.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  It's straight from the Bible, Alex.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  Well, you're totally right.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  And you've encapsulated this.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  So what should the headline be on this little video?
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  I'm going to put it like a two-minute video on some of the platforms.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  Should it be the Red Dragon put Trump on trial?
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:20.000]  Or learn of Trump's greatest enemy, the Red Dragon?
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:22.000]  Or Communist China put Trump on trial?
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:24.000]  Because it really is true.
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  Well, yeah.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  I think I'm not good at putting headlines together like you and other guys.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  But the violence from the Red Dragon is being spewed.
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  And it is.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  It literally is being spewed here now.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  Poisonous acid.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  You're absolutely right.
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  It's all biblical. God bless you.
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  All right.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  Savannah Hernandez and the other camera lady, she's really awesome.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  She doesn't want to come on camera because she's scared.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  Men attacked her.
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:50.000]  She's her shoulders hurt.
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  We're going to come back and give you the latest.

[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:27.000]  like the woman that sexually assaulted Owen,
[3:06:27.000 --> 3:06:29.000]  spending months in jail.
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  Savannah Hernandez 2 nights ago was attacked downtown
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  with her camera woman.
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have discovered who did it
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:39.000]  and we are pressing charges.
[3:06:39.000 --> 3:06:41.000]  But now here's the rest of the story
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  why the woman assaulted her.
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  Here is the video.
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  I'm waiting for you to Google the facts that you can't seem to find.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  Is there an issue?
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:52.000]  Okay.
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  So this is the gentleman right over here that has been calling for people to...
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  He's been harassing me all night long.
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  Now people are putting their signs on my face.
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  So this is where we're at tonight.
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  So people are putting their signs on my face right now.
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  Don't touch me, sir.
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  People are running into me.
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  People are, like, bumping into me.
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:22.000]  Stop, stop, stop.
[3:07:22.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  Don't put it in his face. It's fine.
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  Don't put your sign in my face, sir.
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  People are now running into me.
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  Okay, folks.
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:34.000]  So we're here at the MP's Trump rally.
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:38.000]  And in true fashion, all these people are really inclusive and sweet.
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:40.000]  I got pushed off of a ledge.
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:42.000]  A grown-ass man came and pushed me out of the way
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  because I was asking people why they want the president impeached.
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:49.000]  I'm aggravated because I have a grown-ass man following me around.
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  And you're a grown woman as well.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  I mean, it's just a public event.
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:55.000]  I mean, haven't you been to stuff like this before?
[3:07:55.000 --> 3:07:57.000]  Are you new to this?
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:07:59.000]  Are you not an equal to us?
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  Not to two grown men in the middle of the night.
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  Like, that's kind of weird that you guys are following me around.
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:05.000]  Oh, my God, yeah. There's hundreds of people around.
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:07.000]  Why are you following me around, sir?
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:10.000]  Because I think that you're asking leading questions.
[3:08:10.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  But like I said, I'm still trying to figure out what organization you're with.
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  I'm still trying to figure out why you're following me around,
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:18.000]  saying I'm asking people leading questions, but I'm not.
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  I'm asking people.
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  I'm not judging just from here.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:23.000]  I'm judging as well from the previous rally that you were in.
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  How come you're judging me?
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  Just because I can, because it's a public country.
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  Okay, great. Use your first amendment right and judge me.
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  I think Trump is an asshole and he needs to be impeached.
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:34.000]  How come he needs to be impeached?
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  Because he's broken many laws.
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  He's from this bribery.
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  Yeah, I'm sorry. I thought you, I'm a chop shop reporter.
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  Please don't speak to my microphone. Thanks.
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  What do you think about the articles of impeachment that were introduced today?
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  I think they're all right on.
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  You're basing this off of allegations.
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:53.000]  And you're running with something that's totally irrelevant.
[3:08:53.000 --> 3:08:55.000]  He committed bribery.
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:08:57.000]  How do we go from sexual allegations to bribery?
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  She's the one that brought that up.
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  She's the one that brought that up and I know that I've read that.
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  Okay, but I'm still waiting for you to find me the name of the minor on Google and you haven't.
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  You know, that was so long ago that that was brought out and nothing was made of it.
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:13.000]  Like, okay, he could get away with anything.
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  What about all the comments?
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  He's on audio tape saying, he's on audio tape saying that he grabs people by the pussies, grabs them by the pussies.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  Our president said that out loud.
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  And he said he'd say that while he was president?
[3:09:27.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  He's a type of person that would say that.
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:36.000]  Could you move that like three inches further away from me?
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  I mean, if you want to speak to me into the microphone, I need to put it that close to your face to hear it.
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  I don't want to speak to you in the microphone.
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  Now, why do you keep talking in curves?
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  I have a really bad temper.
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  Okay, and also I'm still waiting for you to Google the facts that you can't seem to find.
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  Is there?
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  Okay.
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  And we are back live broadcasting worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  So a lot of folks wanted to see the rest of the story.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  I mean, did Savannah say something mean?
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:20.000]  Why did the woman attack her?
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  She showed you 40 seconds before she did it, but we went ahead and put out the video because millions of people saw that in the last day and a half.
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  It went viral everywhere.
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  The president's been tweeting out her videos because she goes out and asks good questions and they don't know how to respond to that.
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  And you heard them say, oh, we've seen your videos.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  And so we don't believe you have a First Amendment.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  These are very, very un-American, very, very dangerous people.
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  Now, I had Ezra Levant here yesterday of Rebel Media, the guy has reached billions of views online on a great job that when Tommy Robinson and so many others.
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  And when he saw that, because I was talking to him behind the scenes about trying to fund her operation, more reporters in the 2020, all the persecution he's gone through, he said, listen, when our reporters get punched and attacked, we have a website, we find out who they are, we prosecute the people, and then we raise money from that to help get security.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  That's what you do because let me explain something.
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  I have the armored vehicle.
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  Now, a few months ago, into a Trump rally, we called security guys who are the alumni of this particular group that have security companies.
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  I'll sleep with that.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  And they said, yeah, we've got an armored SUV and we've got an armored pterodine.
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  You could bullhorn out of the top.
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  And I said, oh, that's great.
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:34.000]  No additional charge.
[3:11:34.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  They said, no.
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:38.000]  You know, it's 500 bucks for each guy for the day.
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:40.000]  Okay, great guys.
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  Veterans, patriots.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  I go up there with my security guy, my camera crew, and it was great because they were throwing stuff at us, spitting at us, and we could be up there and still get all the media attention, get our talking points out.
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  So I did a few more events, got the Dallas guys to come down and help our security.
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:12:00.000]  And I said, they said, listen, we bought this thing for $300,000, $330,000.
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  You could have for 200.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  I thought that was a great deal.
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  It's not like I've got it, you know, massaging it.
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  And I've got, you know, Lamborghinis or something parked in our warehouse.
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:10.000]  This is a tool.
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:13.000]  It's turned out that it dominates all over the country.
[3:12:13.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  You've seen the national news with it.
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  Huge, invaluable points about Liberty getting out with the armored vehicle.
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:22.000]  We go to any event, all the left videotapes that it goes out everywhere.
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  Our message gets out.
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:26.000]  This is breaking through the electronic Berlin Wall of censorship.
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:30.000]  But I paid four people to go protect that one.
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  They were throwing bottles, attacking him again downtown at the impeached Trump rally on the eve of impeachment Tuesday night.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:43.000]  Oh, it had just been in New York, just been in DC, just been in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:49.000]  Savannah likes to go into the crowd with action sevens so she can ask real questions and be nice.
[3:12:49.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  They still attacked her.
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  And so literally looking at the budget, I want to be able to hire for her at least one security person to watch her back.
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  She wants to go out five days a week.
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:04.000]  I'm trying to fund the expenses and the pay and security for Caitlyn Bennett, Millie Weaver.
[3:13:04.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  And I'm not complaining here, the left so vicious, we can get invaluable footage and expose them that gets tens of millions of years and is game changing.
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  But it takes money.
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  So he said, well, listen, just watch DefendSavannah.com.
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  It links right to the shopping cart informer store.com.
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  And then literally we can carve out all the proceeds after the cost of products that go to that to have a budget to see how much you want to put Savannah out there.
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  Because I told Savannah a few weeks ago, I said, I'm tired of you getting attacked at OURL.
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  I want to just have you host a show.
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  And she said, listen, I don't care.
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  I'll go out there by myself and she'll talk about it.
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:40.000]  I said, no, you're not.
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:43.000]  So I'm not going to have her getting hit in the head by a bottle.
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  Even though it'll expose these people, it's not happening.
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  We need to get at least two security people when she goes out and does this to watch her back.
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  These people are animals.
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  We don't have the money.
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  I'm trying to hire more reporters right now.
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  I could totally game change.
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  So go to devendsavannah.com.
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  You can also go to support button on informerstore.com.
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  It has a link to Savannah as well.
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  There's a video breaking down her story there and that will fund our operation with her into the future.
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  But I want to get her take just on.
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:16.000]  We've found out who the woman is.
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  We're not going to say her name yet.
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  We are going to press charges and just where she sees all this going.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  And the left trying to claim online that you've done something to her.
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  Now you've released the full video.
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  Right.
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:31.000]  And I released it originally because as with everything, I want people to be able to make their own assumptions about it.
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  Some people think that she was in the wrong.
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  Some people think I was in the wrong.
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:36.000]  So I said, okay, I'll release the full footage.
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  And in that three minute clip, of course, too, when I first walked up, those two men were harassing me.
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  They kind of got other people around me, including her upset.
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:49.000]  And then she came up to me and she said, what are you a chop shop reporter?
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:51.000]  And that's why I was like, okay, well, then don't speak to me.
[3:14:51.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  So I originally was like, okay, don't talk to me then if you think I'm a chop shop reporter, that's fine.
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  She engaged you.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  Yes, she kept talking to me.
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  And the whole reason I was standing there was because I was waiting for her to Google all of the women that Trump raped.
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  And that's what led to the attack.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:08.000]  So that's really what pushed her to do that.
[3:15:08.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  And again, too, I go out with the A7 mic because I do like talking to people and I go to these events and rallies with an open mind.
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  If Trump's bad, tell me why.
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:19.000]  Tell me why.
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:21.000]  And by the way, it's a lot rougher the video shows.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  Talk about your camera lady who's even scared to come on air that men attacked her.
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  Yeah, she was surrounded as well.
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:30.000]  And you can see in that video too, I didn't put that in any of my reports.
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:34.000]  But in that clip, we immediately got surrounded by men.
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  They were shoulder checking us.
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  They were putting signs in our faces.
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  I had this other woman who was like putting a scarf in my face for a good 20 minutes.
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  And we kept trying to walk away and they were like, leave, leave.
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  So we were walking away.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  They were following us and they continued to harass us.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:47.000]  They continued to put signs in our faces.
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:49.000]  And it's like, OK, well, you're telling us to leave.
[3:15:49.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  We're leaving.
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  You're following us.
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:52.000]  And then we're back.
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:54.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain.
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  The hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have approved
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:26.000]  turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment

[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:26.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:31.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:31.000 --> 3:17:35.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  they thought might never be solved.

[3:17:37.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:42.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:24.000]  Don't bother there.
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:26.000]  The globalists have sent in the clowns.
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:28.000]  They've sent in antifa.
[3:18:28.000 --> 3:18:32.000]  They've broken our borders with some of the most hardened criminals from around the world.
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:36.000]  They've tried to poison us with fluoride and GMO and the tainted vaccines.
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  They've sent in their clowns.
[3:18:38.000 --> 3:18:43.000]  But now the men and women of America are taking action and confronting globalists everywhere.
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:46.000]  And I'm so proud of him for wars leading the charge.
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:49.000]  But the only way we can do that is when you keep spreading the word about our broadcast
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:54.000]  and when you keep buying the great products at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:59.000]  I've got a problem that I want to confess to the listeners and viewers.
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:05.000]  I've been on the air so long that I take it for granted now when we break some massive story
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:11.000]  that changes the whole world and that really does great things for the future of not just our children
[3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:13.000]  but our children's children.
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  Info wars really has changed history.
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:20.000]  And that's why I need to pull back and ask the listeners, because I know you're a lot like me,
[3:19:20.000 --> 3:19:23.000]  to really think about a world without info wars.
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:27.000]  Because I can tell you right now, if people don't really step to the plate
[3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:31.000]  and really financially support our broadcast going into 2020,
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:33.000]  we're not going to be on the air in a year or so.
[3:19:33.000 --> 3:19:37.000]  If you do support us, we're not just going to stay on the air.
