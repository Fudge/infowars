[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:33.600]  well I almost went to jail this morning just about an hour ago on my way into work
[00:33.600 --> 00:40.080]  I'll be telling you that story coming up in the next segment we are live it is
[00:40.080 --> 00:50.280]  Thursday the 23rd day of September 2010 I am your host Alex Jones we have very
[00:50.280 --> 00:56.920]  well respected historian that the AP Reuters London independent the Guardian
[00:56.920 --> 01:02.760]  and others are reporting on from the Chinese government's own annals Frank
[01:02.760 --> 01:11.360]  Decatur will be joining us from Rome has written a new book about mouse a tongue
[01:11.360 --> 01:19.160]  killing 45 million people in four years alone now on record the CIA put him into
[01:19.160 --> 01:23.960]  power that's now declassified in 1949 on record they even brag about it on the
[01:23.960 --> 01:28.440]  history channel and of course he killed tens of millions after he got warmed up
[01:28.440 --> 01:33.120]  killing the 45 mill we're all trained how to worship government and lick the
[01:33.120 --> 01:39.160]  boots of the police and we've been trained in America to be slaves basically
[01:39.160 --> 01:44.160]  and that's why our republic is being imploded right now so I thought we'd
[01:44.160 --> 01:48.360]  look at mouse a tongue who was the model for this corporate world government in
[01:48.360 --> 01:53.320]  the words of David Rockefeller in 1976 in the New York Times we went to the
[01:53.320 --> 01:56.680]  microfilm to pull up that article that's actually in my film in-game
[01:56.680 --> 02:02.600]  blueprint for global enslavement and then we've got Judith McGarry they've got
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.600]  this food safety act that will basically shut down family farms and ranches
[02:06.600 --> 02:11.520]  they're trying to pass this week she'll be joining us from Texas she's a lawyer
[02:11.520 --> 02:15.880]  and farm owner she was gonna be on a few days ago but her husband got attacked
[02:15.880 --> 02:19.840]  by Hornets had to go to the hospital so she'll be he's better now she'll be
[02:19.840 --> 02:27.320]  joining us coming up in the third hour of radio broadcast today I've got enough
[02:27.320 --> 02:31.760]  adrenaline flowing through me right now the fuel of 15 or 20 stampeding
[02:31.760 --> 02:37.840]  elephants because I saw from my own eyes the death of this country about an
[02:37.840 --> 02:43.120]  hour and 10 minutes ago yet again the strange thing was I went and visited
[02:43.120 --> 02:47.000]  some family that lives out in Lakeway stayed there last night I went for a
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.520]  jog this morning and said bye to my wife and children and I was just thinking
[02:52.520 --> 02:58.240]  about talking about the police state today and the culture of living in a
[02:58.240 --> 03:04.000]  tyranny and how the system is passing laws to make common people criminals so
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.960]  they can basically incarcerate us all or get fake convictions against us to put
[03:08.960 --> 03:13.600]  us into the system but then the big criminals the central banks the the
[03:13.600 --> 03:18.960]  Kinley types most the time get away with the real crimes that are going on and I
[03:18.960 --> 03:23.560]  thought about how anywhere I am in the United States now police come over and
[03:23.560 --> 03:28.640]  shake my hand they're waking up every time I'm downtown eating every time
[03:28.640 --> 03:34.040]  police stop their cars or stop their bikes or their segues and come over and
[03:34.040 --> 03:38.840]  say we appreciate what you're doing but then we see all these videos of police
[03:38.840 --> 03:43.880]  out of control around the country and we wonder what's what's the separation
[03:43.880 --> 03:48.200]  there you know why are we seeing these two different polar opposites and I know
[03:48.200 --> 03:54.080]  why they are training and encouraging thugism and thuggish behavior and
[03:54.080 --> 03:58.800]  intimidating the people and they are promoting thugs I've seen this over and
[03:58.800 --> 04:02.960]  over again I know one of my friends who is paralyzed from the chest down the
[04:02.960 --> 04:07.280]  cops pulled him over they said what are these hand controls he said I'm paralyzed
[04:07.280 --> 04:09.480]  they said no you're not get out of the car he said well my wife's got to get
[04:09.480 --> 04:13.200]  the wheelchair out of the back I can't walk and the cop pulled him out beat him
[04:13.200 --> 04:18.560]  up and then that cop got promoted to being a commander and it was basically
[04:18.560 --> 04:25.880]  the same thing this morning I when I saw the checkpoint or whatever it was I was
[04:25.880 --> 04:31.280]  trying to find out in a neighborhood I pulled over into a side street I got out
[04:31.280 --> 04:35.880]  politely put on my most charming demeanor and I'm gonna go through it word
[04:35.880 --> 04:39.480]  for word for you I've written notes here of exactly what happened blow-by-blow
[04:39.480 --> 04:46.520]  and this state police officer walked up to me with total hate because to him I'm
[04:46.520 --> 04:52.040]  a blood bag to him I'm a t-bone steak I am here to provide his paycheck and to
[04:52.040 --> 04:56.760]  provide his ego a power trip and nothing more and I had a lot of trouble
[04:56.760 --> 05:01.320]  controlling myself well they're right back stay with us
[05:01.320 --> 05:07.920]  to other police action tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has

[09:04.000 --> 09:07.760]  stolen at least 28 trillion dollars in the last two years according to
[09:07.760 --> 09:11.640]  Bloomberg the country is completely bankrupt they have tripled the number
[09:11.640 --> 09:16.240]  of police and they are trying to train them that the American people are their
[09:16.240 --> 09:22.280]  enemy now I'm going to get into all the financial news all of the political
[09:22.280 --> 09:28.040]  news everything that's happening listeners yesterday made news again you
[09:28.040 --> 09:32.840]  did it I salute you you made the search term dealing with President Obama and
[09:32.840 --> 09:37.240]  the fact that they may stage an attack or let terrorist attack as a pretext to
[09:37.240 --> 09:40.400]  get more control and win the election we have White House officials and
[09:40.400 --> 09:44.280]  advisors saying a terror attack would help them we have the former head of
[09:44.280 --> 09:48.400]  Homeland Security Governor Ridge writing a book admitting that Bush issued fake
[09:48.400 --> 09:53.080]  terror alerts for political aims you made that the number one and number two
[09:53.080 --> 09:57.480]  search engine terms seen at news picked it up many other newspapers and
[09:57.480 --> 10:02.600]  publications CBS picked it up good job hundreds of thousands of additional
[10:02.600 --> 10:07.560]  people are now reading Paul Joseph Watson's powerful article will Obama
[10:07.560 --> 10:13.480]  force America to absorb a terror attack to save his presidency so great job to
[10:13.480 --> 10:17.320]  the listeners we have a historian coming on with new evidence of just how many
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.080]  people Mao Zedong killed in the next hour I'll probably be listed as anti
[10:22.080 --> 10:25.640]  government by the state police for criticizing Mao Zedong their hero I
[10:25.640 --> 10:30.920]  guess but that is all coming up as well then we'll talk to Judith McGarry
[10:30.920 --> 10:36.720]  lawyer and a farm owner who is extremely prominent than and heads up farm and
[10:36.720 --> 10:41.360]  ranch freedom dot org dealing with this legislation to further shut down farms
[10:41.360 --> 10:45.320]  and ranches nationwide federal regulations have been passed for 15
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.680]  million dollar fines for garage sales they are trying to pass laws for five
[10:50.680 --> 10:55.280]  thousand dollar fines for growing tomatoes in your backyard total hell is
[10:55.280 --> 10:59.680]  being released on the American people as they try to break our back and train us
[10:59.680 --> 11:03.760]  that were slaves now let me get into what happened this morning I didn't stay at
[11:03.760 --> 11:07.560]  my house last night I was visiting family out in Lake wave we stayed out
[11:07.560 --> 11:14.320]  there last night I got in the car to come into work and I was driving around
[11:14.320 --> 11:20.200]  in a neighborhood in a neighborhood and saw that five six seven it's probably
[11:20.200 --> 11:24.200]  about seven I didn't have time to count them all squad cars state police squad
[11:24.200 --> 11:29.520]  cars and they had one of those little tents set up on the side of the road and
[11:29.520 --> 11:35.400]  I turned into a neighborhood and in part by somebody's driveway and I walked up
[11:35.400 --> 11:41.800]  and I politely said hey how you doing troopers what's going on because again
[11:41.800 --> 11:47.240]  I wanted to see and of course my iPhone I checked it as I pulled up it was out of
[11:47.240 --> 11:51.480]  batteries it's an old one so the batteries burnout it only takes a
[11:51.480 --> 11:55.720]  charge for about 45 minutes it was dead or I would have taken photos with it or
[11:55.720 --> 12:00.040]  or recorded audio to document what was going on but I just pulled over and I
[12:00.040 --> 12:06.360]  do this all the time one time I saw a bunch of police and news on 360 and I
[12:06.360 --> 12:10.800]  pulled off at a restaurant walked over the police Austin police didn't run up
[12:10.800 --> 12:14.600]  and get in my face and I talked to the media and I said well I said what's
[12:14.600 --> 12:19.080]  going on very politely and they said somebody keeps turning the gas on in
[12:19.080 --> 12:23.200]  the neighborhood and turning the gas off and they actually then hey can we get a
[12:23.200 --> 12:26.480]  quote from you about what you think of this as I was on the local news some
[12:26.480 --> 12:32.160]  folks saw that earlier this year but I do that all the time if I see a police
[12:32.160 --> 12:36.200]  checkpoint whether it's on I-35 or in a neighborhood it's been ruled by the
[12:36.200 --> 12:41.640]  Supreme Court and state courts that it's illegal and I pull up and walk over and
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.400]  I ask questions and I pull I stay back at a distance say hey they come over
[12:45.400 --> 12:49.560]  what's going on and usually they don't treat me like a slave that they treat
[12:49.560 --> 12:55.100]  their boss the citizen that pays their bill I've had cops tell me oh no I pay
[12:55.100 --> 12:59.000]  taxes to I pay my salary no the government takes two private sector
[12:59.000 --> 13:02.960]  jobs for every government job get it through your head okay we pay your
[13:02.960 --> 13:07.280]  salary and you know it okay so there's this arrogance kind of like Obama's
[13:07.280 --> 13:11.520]  aunt saying I'm an illegal alien and you owe me welfare you owe me citizenship
[13:11.520 --> 13:15.880]  it's this arrogance so I'm gonna go through exactly what happened then I'm
[13:15.880 --> 13:19.120]  gonna walk through how this affects everybody and I was already gonna talk
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.760]  about this today it's funny this happened so I'm driving down this side
[13:23.760 --> 13:28.160]  street by a neighborhood a little two-lane road and there's all these
[13:28.160 --> 13:31.600]  state police milling around and it looked like what I saw a few months ago
[13:31.600 --> 13:35.320]  and I went to Slyterbonne in New Braunfels and we had booked it again a
[13:35.320 --> 13:39.200]  little motel there to take my kids but it was such a police state I canceled it
[13:39.200 --> 13:41.560]  and I said I was gonna cancel it I probably won't go back to Slyterbonne
[13:41.560 --> 13:45.480]  because the police are so bad down there and but of course you can't run I
[13:45.480 --> 13:49.440]  mean they're putting it in everywhere but I I noticed every day that when
[13:49.440 --> 13:52.680]  people were getting off the river the police were taking photos of them they
[13:52.680 --> 13:59.320]  had tents set up they were taking people to jail and I drove through one of those
[13:59.320 --> 14:04.200]  and my inspection sticker was out I hadn't noticed it pulled me over gave me
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.640]  a ticket whatever but but the issue is the illegal aliens can drunk drive
[14:08.640 --> 14:12.680]  they're above the law there the police are told leave them alone so again I'm
[14:12.680 --> 14:16.720]  I'm the mark I'm the citizen that deserves all of this so it looked like
[14:16.720 --> 14:19.720]  one of those checkpoints I knew the state police were trying to put them in
[14:19.720 --> 14:25.040]  place again in the state of Texas so I pulled off pulled down a side street
[14:25.040 --> 14:31.520]  about 60 70 yards down even thought about it I said well you know this is
[14:31.520 --> 14:36.120]  mailboxes and people's houses I can park here I knew they might try to say I
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.960]  was parked illegally you know any way to get you in their system that's why they
[14:38.960 --> 14:43.340]  passed laws 15 million dollar fines for garage sales it's about you know $5,000
[14:43.340 --> 14:46.400]  fines for tomatoes being grown in your backyard it's about getting you in the
[14:46.400 --> 14:51.800]  system that's what tyranny is and I walk up and there's all these state police
[14:51.800 --> 14:54.880]  officers standing around probably six seven eight nine maybe more but that's
[14:54.880 --> 14:58.640]  just who I could see they were by the way they were parked out in the road they
[14:58.640 --> 15:01.760]  weren't even parked all the way on the shoulder so it's a two-lane road and
[15:01.760 --> 15:04.720]  people were having to stop because you couldn't drive two cars down the road
[15:04.720 --> 15:09.120]  because the state police were all parked haphazardly halfway in the road you
[15:09.120 --> 15:12.720]  see this all the time it's almost like it's their enjoyment to block traffic
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.200]  and train you the slave that they can do whatever they want but I walk up
[15:17.200 --> 15:21.880]  politely and I'm about 30 yards away and they say what do you do you know what
[15:21.880 --> 15:26.680]  do you want and this state police officer starts walking over to me and he
[15:26.680 --> 15:31.280]  literally was about as tall as Yosemite Sam folks I'm 5 10 I'm not into how
[15:31.280 --> 15:35.520]  tall you are how big you are but there is that Napoleonic complex and the feds
[15:35.520 --> 15:39.080]  have admitted they've written handbooks to hire police now with only under a
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.520]  hundred IQ and they like to hire short ones this is on record who have a
[15:43.520 --> 15:47.280]  Napoleonic complex you'll notice most the commanders now are barely pushing five
[15:47.280 --> 15:51.240]  feet because they got something to prove and this guy who literally looked
[15:51.240 --> 15:55.240]  like Yosemite Sam I mean he was so little I thought he was a munchkin
[15:55.240 --> 15:59.600]  because I'm not big and he came up to my chest I mean I had like a foot on him
[15:59.600 --> 16:08.280]  Yosemite Sam comes up and I said how you doing and he said who are you like a

[25:22.240 --> 25:29.200]  there goes our way of life it's not about food it's about keeping going upon

[25:44.520 --> 25:51.760]  that's from a bug's life it's not about food it's about keeping those ants in
[25:51.760 --> 25:58.000]  line so a puny little ant saw what appeared to be a checkpoint I didn't
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.520]  know they may have been doing something else but it looked like other
[26:01.520 --> 26:07.240]  checkpoints I've seen I politely park walk over wait for one of my kings my
[26:07.240 --> 26:12.200]  lords my owners to walk over and I politely say hi trooper how you doing
[26:12.200 --> 26:19.680]  what's going on out here who are you well I'm Alex Jones getting your car and
[26:19.680 --> 26:26.200]  get out of here and just he looked crazy showing his teeth at me getting your
[26:26.200 --> 26:31.040]  car and get out of here pointing his finger at me and I was I knew that was
[26:31.040 --> 26:34.920]  what was gonna happen I was hoping it wouldn't happen I was hoping he'd be a
[26:34.920 --> 26:39.040]  good human being and a guardian of liberty but he's just a midget on a
[26:39.040 --> 26:46.800]  power trip a guy in a John Wayne outfit who's no John Wayne out there in his
[26:46.800 --> 26:55.600]  John Wayne cat costume Yosemite Sam yeah that'll be the new name of Sergeant
[26:55.600 --> 27:05.280]  Baker is Yosemite Sam Sergeant Yosemite Sam state police officer who I guess
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.160]  writes tickets to old ladies all day and licks the boots of illegal aliens you
[27:08.160 --> 27:12.120]  know we know they let them go and they run from the border when they get shot at
[27:12.120 --> 27:17.400]  by the Mexican troops and cartels but hey wouldn't you if you had the American
[27:17.400 --> 27:23.760]  cows to milk I'd forgotten that part of the story right before I turned to leave
[27:23.760 --> 27:27.000]  as he was saying you get out of here right now just enjoying that power you
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.880]  slave you don't ask me anything you get out of here I looked at his name tag but
[27:33.880 --> 27:37.920]  his badge number was covered up but they always have some little excuse or
[27:37.920 --> 27:41.720]  someone they're remembering to cover up the badge number which is a violation of
[27:41.720 --> 27:45.680]  state law it's the religion to break the law for these people because but they're
[27:45.680 --> 27:50.000]  they're the good guys they get to you know do whatever they want and I said so
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.960]  it's trooper Baker and he said it's sergeant Baker now I said get out of
[27:55.960 --> 28:02.840]  here it's none of your business and he was thinking your only businesses to pay
[28:02.840 --> 28:07.760]  my check and build up my ego when I pull your wife and kids over boy he didn't
[28:07.760 --> 28:12.560]  say that but I remember driving down 37 four or five years ago going to
[28:12.560 --> 28:18.960]  Port Aransas to do some fishing with my wife and children and my two children at
[28:18.960 --> 28:22.120]  the time now I have three were asleep in the back all belted in with their
[28:22.120 --> 28:27.120]  little little blankets on them these two state police pull us over we're going
[28:27.120 --> 28:31.160]  five miles over the speed limit and they're saying we want the back we want
[28:31.160 --> 28:34.240]  to look at see if these seat belts are on right these kids are in the seats right
[28:34.240 --> 28:37.920]  and they and one had horrible breath and the woman was on a power trip they were
[28:37.920 --> 28:42.400]  all acting craze like they were wolves chasing down a sheep and I just said
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.480]  look you don't have any probable cause my children are belted in they're my
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.320]  children I care about them a lot more than you do I go you write me your ticket

[37:32.800 --> 37:36.160]  what all the John Wayne outfits and the fancy uniforms are about it's about
[37:36.160 --> 37:42.400]  status government is the status and government is a dangerous servant and a
[37:42.400 --> 37:46.840]  fearful master you know who said that George Washington then I have FEMA on
[37:46.840 --> 37:51.160]  video in Kansas City sent to me by a firefighter to firefighters police and
[37:51.160 --> 37:59.360]  state police with FEMA telling him George Washington was a terrorist government
[37:59.360 --> 38:07.040]  is a dangerous servant a fearful master like fire not easily controlled in fact
[38:07.040 --> 38:11.640]  I'm paraphrasing that we pull up the terrorist according to these people
[38:11.640 --> 38:17.960]  George Washington you think George Washington would somebody walked up to
[38:17.960 --> 38:22.120]  him when he was a militia commander and said what what are you what's going on

[39:00.800 --> 39:07.160]  ashamed for him but see the globalist the globalist want us to be ashamed of
[39:07.160 --> 39:11.120]  the police this is the psychology they train them to act like thugs they
[39:11.120 --> 39:14.280]  train them to be abusive they train them to violate rights they train them to be
[39:14.280 --> 39:18.480]  callous they train them to be an us against them mentality then it becomes
[39:18.480 --> 39:24.400]  a self-fulfilling prophecy and the public starts disliking them and the feds
[39:24.400 --> 39:29.040]  with their training say see they don't like you you've all got to stick together
[39:29.040 --> 39:34.120]  and it's basically gang mentality it's the biggest street gang in the world and
[39:34.120 --> 39:37.400]  it's growing and growing and growing and growing and everything that's being
[39:37.400 --> 39:40.840]  done in the public schools and the airports and everywhere are these
[39:40.840 --> 39:45.240]  testing grounds they admit to train you to be a total prisoner they found the
[39:45.240 --> 39:48.640]  quote let's put it back up on screen for prison planet dot TV viewers government
[39:48.640 --> 39:52.440]  is not reason it is not eloquence it is force like fire it is a dangerous
[39:52.440 --> 39:59.440]  servant and a fearful master let's read that quote again for people now you're
[39:59.440 --> 40:02.320]  either with George Washington and you're against George Washington you
[40:02.320 --> 40:06.000]  either think that's extremist talk or it isn't let's put it back on screen
[40:06.000 --> 40:13.720]  government is not reason it is not eloquence it is force like fire it is a
[40:13.720 --> 40:20.120]  dangerous servant and a fearful master and government is now trying to be our
[40:20.120 --> 40:24.920]  master every other country in history turns into tyranny every other country
[40:24.920 --> 40:29.840]  has an elite come in that paramilitarizes the police and uses the military against
[40:29.840 --> 40:35.400]  the public every country sets up secret police and tattletale squads and
[40:35.400 --> 40:39.560]  demonization of people that don't like it every government seeks to control
[40:39.560 --> 40:44.560]  farms and ranches and agrarian areas to dominate the public every if you go down
[40:44.560 --> 40:49.760]  a checklist of tyranny they are checking each box off repeatedly and adding new
[40:49.760 --> 40:56.120]  boxes no one can deny that this country is in trouble and I got news for the
[40:56.120 --> 40:59.960]  globalist and all their minions it's over the people are waking up no amount
[40:59.960 --> 41:04.880]  of stage terror attacks no amount of new wars no amount of flu hysteria no amount
[41:04.880 --> 41:09.200]  of the crises you create are going to put the genie back in the bottle Humpty
[41:09.200 --> 41:15.040]  Dumpty sat on a wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall all the king's horses and
[41:15.040 --> 41:19.280]  all the king's men aren't putting your stinking little tyranny back together
[41:19.280 --> 41:24.520]  again Congress can pass laws given the UN control over our waterways and our
[41:24.520 --> 41:28.920]  lakes you can pass laws to not let us drill water wells people are just going
[41:28.920 --> 41:32.080]  to stop following what you have to say and as you back them up against a wall
[41:32.080 --> 41:35.960]  because you want to raise the taxes and put satellite tracker boxes and all the
[41:35.960 --> 41:43.200]  cars to track and traces and control us it isn't going to work okay and they are
[41:43.200 --> 41:46.200]  psychologically profiling every time I mention this people don't believe me it's
[41:46.200 --> 41:51.080]  so outrageous I don't blame you in fact guys we it's MSNBC's the first one that
[41:51.080 --> 41:58.720]  comes up man's shoes police department because IQ too high will pull up these
[41:58.720 --> 42:03.040]  some of the articles there's in many of these suits and they tell them your IQ
[42:03.040 --> 42:10.320]  is 102 which is just above average and I mean those people with 190 IQs folks and
[42:10.320 --> 42:14.360]  so we're not going to hire you that's a policy that was done secretly through
[42:14.360 --> 42:18.600]  federal funds about 20 years ago it's now public and now they're trying to
[42:18.600 --> 42:25.360]  lower it to 90 I mean 90 is not very smart pretty pretty dull I mean what
[42:25.360 --> 42:34.480]  soon will they get folks with 70 IQs probably probably me boss now you don't
[42:34.480 --> 42:41.600]  ask you don't ask sergeant Baker question you lick boots you polish boots
[42:41.600 --> 42:49.640]  of Baker you see my cowboy hat I am tough you don't ask me questions you're
[42:49.640 --> 42:56.720]  supposed to be afraid of sergeant Baker what was the other Thomas Jefferson
[42:56.720 --> 43:00.680]  quote another terrorist according to I guess the state police and the filthy
[43:00.680 --> 43:06.080]  government we've got that's delusional and believes all its own propaganda
[43:06.080 --> 43:13.400]  liberty is a let me give you the exact quote guys in fact pull it up double
[43:13.400 --> 43:19.720]  check me Thomas Jefferson when the government fears the people we have
[43:19.720 --> 43:25.160]  liberty when the government fears the people we have liberty when the people
[43:25.160 --> 43:32.640]  fear the government we have tyranny Thomas Jefferson I'm gonna continue to
[43:32.640 --> 43:38.480]  quote terrorist here on air okay remember the feds are teaching nationwide
[43:38.480 --> 43:42.720]  that anything good is terrorism and remember the whole Homeland Security
[43:42.720 --> 43:53.200]  report sent to us by good state police and good federal Marshall good people
[43:53.200 --> 43:57.520]  remember that national news said the entire Homeland Security apparatus is
[43:57.520 --> 44:08.800]  for conservatives gun owners returning veterans libertarians it's for you
[44:08.800 --> 44:12.880]  you're told it's for men in caves that are funded by the CIA that if you don't
[44:12.880 --> 44:17.360]  give your rights up they'll come get you know it's for you it's for you and the
[44:17.360 --> 44:21.040]  police want you to know that now a lot of them are good men and women and aren't
[44:21.040 --> 44:24.840]  going along with the programming but the programming the directive is to slap us
[44:24.840 --> 44:28.320]  around like they're the pimp and we're the prostitute and they're going to let
[44:28.320 --> 44:34.240]  us know put the quote back up for me please when the people fear their
[44:34.240 --> 44:39.840]  government there is tyranny when the government fears the people there is
[44:39.840 --> 44:45.480]  liberty and that doesn't say who the quote that somebody wrote that in an
[44:45.480 --> 44:50.560]  article somebody flipped the Thomas Jefferson also that's a Thomas Jefferson
[44:50.560 --> 44:53.600]  quote so I guess I flipped it when the people fear the government there is
[44:53.600 --> 44:58.160]  tyranny when the government fears the people there is liberty I mean what do
[44:58.160 --> 45:01.040]  you think Thomas Jefferson would have thought if he was in a time machine and
[45:01.040 --> 45:09.480]  he was teleported to the morning of September 23rd 2010 and if he could be
[45:09.480 --> 45:16.520]  floating around in the clouds teleported into the future 200 plus years and he
[45:16.520 --> 45:23.000]  sees Alex Jones pull over parked down a street he I'm in a neighborhood and I
[45:23.000 --> 45:28.520]  politely walk up and put on my charm and I was thinking I hope they're good I
[45:28.520 --> 45:32.520]  hope they're good I want to find out a if this is an illegal checkpoint but be
[45:32.520 --> 45:35.440]  I want to see how they treat me and I was thinking man I hope they're good but
[45:35.440 --> 45:41.120]  I got a bad feeling and I just said hi hey troopers how's it going what's
[45:41.120 --> 45:48.640]  going on here how dare an al-Qaeda how dare a combatant how dare somebody
[45:48.640 --> 45:53.200]  that can talk the citizens are supposed to drive by scared and see the cops and
[45:53.200 --> 45:56.520]  get scared and go in the checkpoints and be asked questions and be put in
[45:56.520 --> 45:59.600]  naked body scanners where they illegally record your genitals and then lied
[45:59.600 --> 46:04.440]  about it and got caught it's a criminal government they lie even when the truth
[46:04.440 --> 46:13.760]  would suit them better and I politely was humiliated but I wasn't
[46:13.760 --> 46:17.000]  humiliated in the way he thought I was humiliated for this country I was
[46:17.000 --> 46:22.840]  humiliated for my children's future I was humiliated by petty nobody's put in
[46:22.840 --> 46:28.640]  thuggest positions of abusive power to boss citizens around with relish and
[46:28.640 --> 46:34.120]  enjoyment and treat me like trash that guy was savoring bearing his teeth he
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.960]  was savoring his eyes just gleaming with hatred like I had you know slapped
[46:38.960 --> 46:43.360]  his grandmother or something I mean this was anger and hate and disgust that
[46:43.360 --> 46:49.720]  that I could barely even summon for my enemies but I but it's summoning me just
[46:49.720 --> 46:54.880]  just total disgust but see everybody doesn't have a syndicated radio show
[46:54.880 --> 46:59.160]  one of the biggest on the planet yeah here's video we're showing on screen of
[46:59.160 --> 47:02.800]  the state police when we're out there for a rally coming over and saying you
[47:02.800 --> 47:07.960]  don't videotape in America in your idea and boy he had some disgust but but
[47:07.960 --> 47:13.840]  but nothing nothing compared to what this guy did fade up the audio of this
[47:13.840 --> 47:17.160]  guy talking to Aaron from where you had it it was good you don't have any of
[47:17.160 --> 47:24.400]  that because that's my job I'm acting again do you have an ID where is your
[47:24.400 --> 47:29.440]  driver's license here I need to see it then all right but see he sounds calm
[47:29.440 --> 47:36.440]  but his eyes are angry this cop was 100 times I mean seething with what I would
[47:36.440 --> 47:42.720]  call demonic hatred hey what's going on here what are you doing I'm just seeing
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.600]  what's going on it's not your business get in your car get out of here get out
[47:47.600 --> 47:51.640]  of here I mean he if this is the same type of angry energy that you would
[47:51.640 --> 47:56.800]  expect from Davy Crockett defending the Alamo this is hatred you summon up when
[47:56.800 --> 47:59.480]  you're fighting for your life and I guess he was fighting for his life
[47:59.480 --> 48:06.560]  because his life is being a thug that's his way of life and he felt it was
[48:06.560 --> 48:13.280]  threatened by a polite congenial well-dressed person having good feelings
[48:13.280 --> 48:19.520]  for him and they think they're gonna win they think they're gonna bring this
[48:19.520 --> 48:24.680]  country down they think they've got it all figured out at their surface of
[48:24.680 --> 48:29.720]  their consciousness at the surface of their consciousness they're the
[48:29.720 --> 48:36.640]  guardians of us but deep down with a control freak like Yosemite Sam
[48:36.640 --> 48:42.960]  Sergeant Baker he probably already got a nickname like Yosemite Sam because some
[48:42.960 --> 48:46.640]  of the other guys obviously who I was and they were smiling at first and looking
[48:46.640 --> 48:51.280]  and by the time I got in my car and drove back he was up there just looking
[48:51.280 --> 48:56.200]  at me calling in my plate so he was gonna get me oh yeah oh and they got that
[48:56.200 --> 49:00.720]  they got that Travis County Sheriff to get behind me and let me know I'm being
[49:00.720 --> 49:07.760]  watched boy in fact pull up the Philadelphia Pennsylvania ad where they
[49:07.760 --> 49:11.080]  say we're watching you with satellites we're gonna get our money from you they
[49:11.080 --> 49:15.800]  want you to know that you're being watched they want you to know you're
[49:15.800 --> 49:20.960]  being controlled remember they denied the satellites were being used against
[49:20.960 --> 49:24.520]  citizens now they're harassing farmers and ranchers with it and it's always
[49:24.520 --> 49:30.120]  because it's the law it's the rules but then when the Federal Reserve gets up
[49:30.120 --> 49:33.400]  and Congress says where's the trillions of dollars they say we're not gonna tell
[49:33.400 --> 49:40.000]  you no you're there to protect the criminal status quo and the status quo is
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.920]  getting worse let's go ahead and play this clip where they're intimidating us
[49:42.920 --> 49:48.520]  let us know we're being watched is Tom you live just off of Fitz Street nice
[49:48.520 --> 49:56.000]  car Tom nice house what's not so nice is you owe Pennsylvania $4,212 in back
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.760]  taxes listen Tom we can make this easy pay online by June 18th and we'll skip
[50:02.760 --> 50:09.520]  your penalty and take half off your interest because Tom we do know who you
[50:09.520 --> 50:14.200]  are find out before we find you and they have these announcements nationwide
[50:14.200 --> 50:17.480]  more than 10% of Texas has warrants out for them with all the petty stuff they
[50:17.480 --> 50:21.640]  can't pay because we're imploding and they run ads roundup coming up next week
[50:21.640 --> 50:25.120]  roundup roundup so when they have real political roundups all the sheep have

[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:39.560]  of the Smurfs the more I think about it he looked like a cross between your 70s

[1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:48.440]  very very sickening to see a illegal checkpoint what appeared to be this
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:51.960]  morning they wouldn't tell me and to have them get my face and treat me like a
[1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:58.680]  piece of trash and I was very polite gold is up $4 a day to $1,295 an ounce
[1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:02.200]  and it's way over that what you can actually buy it for in the market
[1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:09.240]  shortages have begun and the dollar is being devalued the the federal reserve
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:14.880]  is involved in more quantitative easing more printing of money that's what
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:19.200]  happened to Mexico what happens in bob way why more republic germany and they
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:23.120]  are now buying more and more of u.s. bonds no nobody will buy them foreign
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:27.080]  governments individuals won't buy them so gold's going up because the dollars
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:31.560]  being devalued and I wanted to briefly but ahead of this historian joining us
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:35.040]  in the next segment on mouse a tongue and what we're going to face in this
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:38.040]  country there's no doubt about it it's the same people that ran now running
[1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:42.080]  this want to bring Ted up briefly because he ran out of the deals of gold and
[1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:47.240]  silver he bought a few months ago that was priced into the market 30 40 50 60
[1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:51.160]  depending on the deal under you know what it should have been selling for he
[1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:55.680]  still got some he bought a few weeks ago that is way under what anybody else can
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:59.200]  sell it to you for and so to tell us about what's happening in the gold
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:03.120]  market briefly is Ted Anderson Ted thanks for joining us yeah hey thanks for
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:06.600]  having me up again and yeah I'd like you said Alex the Fed is stepping in and
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:11.880]  that's driving the driving the dollar down it's driving gold up right now we
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:16.400]  do have the Frank currently at 279 you do get the full year subscription to the
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:21.840]  international forecaster when you buy that so it really discounts it down to
[1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:27.680]  about $560 gold considering the fact that golds almost $1,300 an ounce today
[1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:33.520]  that is one wonderful buy walking Liberty halves at 1050 another great buy
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:39.640]  British sovereigns at 357 a lot of people are calling Alex for that CBO report
[1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:44.440]  which makes me real happy the federal and debt the federal debt and risk of
[1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:48.600]  financial crises document which came out of the government you know you just
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:52.680]  said what you ought to give out is the Pentagon two weeks ago saying that they
[1:02:52.680 --> 1:02:56.000]  believe the US is gonna collapse because of the debt well that's actually the
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:01.160]  bankers plan we have the 2002 IMF World Bank documents they create the crisis
[1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:05.520]  that offer the solution giving themselves more power and these Yosemite Sam
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:09.800]  police that are more than happy to bully the public well you know I really should
[1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:13.160]  take a look at that document because nothing makes me more happy than to have
[1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:16.760]  the government expose itself in their evil plan but they're only exposing it
[1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:20.920]  to say see we better enslave you because we we stole everything right exactly
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:24.680]  obviously there's an agenda there but you know if people wake up and realize
[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:28.720]  that they can't keep themselves in this paper currency anymore I mean the
[1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:32.800]  Bloomberg story says that they have to get out that they have to buy gold and
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:36.400]  silver it's not like it's not like you know Bloomberg I mean here he is a stock
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:39.680]  guy he's telling people that they have to buy gold and silver this is today's
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:43.960]  story and you know and it just it just gets to the point here now where it's
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:47.880]  just getting utter ridiculous to stay into the paper currencies the stock
[1:03:47.880 --> 1:03:52.160]  market the bond market if you're gonna be in the annuities if even in the real
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:56.400]  estate because there's such a bubble there that you know it it really doesn't
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:59.720]  make sense to have anything other than gold and silver because that has been
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:04.160]  money for over 6,000 years and that's why it pleases me to see that people are
[1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:08.440]  willing to pick up the CBO report coming from Congress and actually get the
[1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:12.080]  information that says yes indeed there's absolutely but it's on record we're
[1:04:12.080 --> 1:04:15.760]  going into a planned depression people need to call how much are the silver
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:19.600]  half dollars right now well right now are there at 1050 and okay everywhere
[1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:24.400]  else the lowest is 12 that I've seen a lot of places 16 how long will it last
[1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:27.160]  at 1050 a piece I'm gonna hold it for today for sure
[1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:37.400]  I'll give the number 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 they've got all sorts of great
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:41.600]  coins at great prices in gold the Franks the sovereigns the buffaloes that are
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:46.200]  hard to get normally have huge premiums not with Midas resources find out the
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:49.720]  great listings tell them it's the radio offer or you'll pay more and that price

[1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:23.520]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:27.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:32.000]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every

[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:08.200]  balance of this hour award-winning historian researcher has a book out
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:13.880]  that's getting a lot of powerful reviews the Chinese government helped compile a
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:18.360]  book a decade ago or so admitting that Mao killed 80 plus million our government
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:23.040]  says he killed 84 million but we have one of the leading experts on Mao's mass
[1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:28.200]  murder joining us here's a Bloomberg headline starved by Mao cannibal China
[1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:34.080]  eight earth rob graves continuing Mao's great leap forward killed 45 million in

[1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:45.160]  famine by Frank Decatur the horrors of China's great leap forward are unveiled
[1:09:45.160 --> 1:09:53.080]  in this masterfully study of the hateful plan huge book huge stew pots cooking
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:56.040]  people that that's what the Chinese books I've read translated into English
[1:09:56.040 --> 1:10:00.800]  talk about and this was praised by David Rockefeller in 1976 in the New York
[1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:04.640]  Times this is what big government does and according to our government any
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:08.480]  criticism of government is terrorism so I guess this is this is the type of
[1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:12.280]  system we all need to live under according to many people that worship big
[1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:19.040]  government and collectivism but I really appreciate our guests joining us
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:24.320]  today Frank Decatur is an author of Mao's great famine the history of China's
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:29.480]  most devastating catastrophe published by Bloomsbury and Walker books he's the
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:32.800]  chair professor of humanities for the University of Hong Kong a professor of
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.200]  the modern history of China on leave from the school of Oriental and African
[1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:40.160]  studies University of London born in the Netherlands of 61 he's educated in
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:44.160]  Switzerland it goes on and on he's published nine books that have changed
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:49.120]  the way historians view modern China from the classics the discourse on race in
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:54.280]  modern China the China before Mao the age of openness Frank Decatur is
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:58.400]  married and lives in Hong Kong he's in Rome right now sir thank you for coming
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:03.720]  on the show thank you very much you got the floor start at the beginning Mao
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:08.960]  say tongue the greatest mass murderer in history now they have coffee shops and
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:13.240]  hotels and eateries named after him young people wear his shirt I see it all
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:17.440]  over the streets he's he's he's supposedly like Martin Luther King to
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:22.800]  many people so I thought we'd have you on tell us about Mao say tongue well he's
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:29.400]  a man who conquered China in 1949 and he's also a man who started the war in
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:35.000]  Korea against the Americans a few years later and hundreds of thousands if not
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:40.720]  millions of people lost their lives during those two events but they compare
[1:11:40.720 --> 1:11:47.280]  they do not compare to what happened from 1958 onwards when Mao wanted to turn
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:52.280]  every man and every woman in that country into a soldier into one giant army
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:57.760]  that he could use in a continuous revolution to somehow tackle both
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:02.400]  agriculture and industry at the same time so what he did with the great leap
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:08.880]  forward in 1958 is very much collectivize everything and herd people in the
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:14.120]  countryside into giant people's communes people in the countryside had their
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:19.080]  homes collectivized the land was taken away from them the belongings were
[1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:25.720]  stripped away they had nothing left except the choice to obey the party
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:30.760]  commands and the party command was to work all day and all night so that the
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:36.280]  country could be that overtake England in 15 years that was the slogan to
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:41.480]  overtake England in 15 years and before you know it every incentive to work was
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:48.400]  stripped away and people had no reason to work except the fear of pain and
[1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:54.400]  violence so in the countryside party officials and farmers became locked in
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:13:02.560]  a mounting spiral of violence in which people were beaten were were covered in
[1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:07.960]  excrement were sometimes buried alive for the slightest misdemeanor
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:13.760]  misdemeanor stealing a potato could warrant a death sentence
[1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:22.760]  please continue sir okay I'll continue one of the big miss one of the big
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:27.320]  myths about the great leap forward is that people simply died of hunger because
[1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:33.800]  there was no food available but having looked at a whole series of party
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:37.160]  archives you have to understand this is a one-party state that is very
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:41.800]  meticulous like Nazi Germany like the Soviet Union very meticulous in
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:47.640]  compiling notes about everything it does so these are massive archives and they
[1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:52.520]  illustrate something that is very prevalent during that period namely
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:58.640]  that food is used as a weapon it is not simply that people starve to death they
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:05.280]  are starved to death very deliberately as a deliberate selection of people who
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:10.400]  are banned from the canteen a professor can I interject something here because
[1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:16.120]  I know you're very well read one of the leading experts on the last 70 years in
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:20.880]  China have you noticed that they had a Beijing World Food Summit in the mid
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:25.640]  1990s and the UN said we will use food as a weapon and in State Department
[1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:30.440]  memorandum 200 by Henry Kissinger he talked about using the Chinese model in
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:35.240]  the third world of using food as a weapon I don't know about it but it
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:39.440]  doesn't sound very promising that's all I can say okay well let's continue then
[1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:43.120]  with the model of using food as a weapon because I happen to have an article here
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:47.360]  the Livable Communities Act and the stated goal is to force people under
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:53.160]  agenda 21 into sustainable cities and only basically allow big agribusiness to
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:58.040]  operate but but sorry I was just drawing parallels to here go ahead please of
[1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:02.640]  course there are parallels to be made but at that particular point in time the
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:06.800]  fact that a one-party state was in control of all the food meant that if you
[1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:10.920]  did not work if you did not go to the fields and perform the work that you
[1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:16.360]  were asked to do or if you were too weak or too vulnerable or too old or and
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:20.320]  sometimes too young to actually earn your keep you were banned from the
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:25.320]  canteen and entire groups of people were deliberately starved to death during
[1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:32.680]  that period from 1958 to 62 something similar in Ukraine very much a similar
[1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:36.400]  thing in other words what Stalin did in the Ukraine and in other parts of the
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:42.280]  Soviet Union was collectivize the countryside and strip every incentive to
[1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:47.800]  work away from the farmers in other words people were locked in this cycle of
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:52.120]  violence with party officials were there to take as much grain as they could and
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:58.600]  farmers who saw no reason to work except fear now now you talked about being
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:03.280]  buried alive for for small things how would they execute people and I remember
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:07.800]  back in 98 or so there were some big books that came out in China that the
[1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:11.960]  government's you know officially sanctioned where they talked about 80
[1:16:11.960 --> 1:16:17.560]  million dead they talked about large stew pots of human flesh is is that true
[1:16:17.560 --> 1:16:24.560]  or is that a distortion that may have happened in a few very isolated cases
[1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:30.040]  but the most common instrument of punishment at that time was was a stick
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:34.560]  you just beat people to get them into the fields when the two famished to work
[1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:39.280]  you beat them together or you strip them in the middle of the winter so that
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:45.040]  they have to work just to stay warm the case of people being buried alive is
[1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:50.880]  reported all over China from the north all the way to the south near Canton in
[1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:56.160]  one case a man is forced to bury his own son alive because his son has stolen a
[1:16:56.160 --> 1:17:01.000]  handful of grain well this man obviously is heartbroken he dies of grief
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:07.200]  after three weeks he can't continue and the countless cases of torture taking
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:13.120]  place for the slightest misdemeanor against some party command well now if
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:17.080]  you don't follow the smallest order you get tasered people die every day of
[1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:20.840]  heart attacks but I guess that's America so it's okay I'm sorry go ahead sir
[1:17:20.840 --> 1:17:27.000]  well I'd rather get tased which rather get tased and have one of my ears chopped
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  off yes locked off or being buried alive or being pulled being being being
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:40.040]  covered in excrement or being tied up and thrown into a pond or being branded
[1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:44.840]  with a sizzling tool like an animal amazing please continue professor
[1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:51.440]  and ways of punishing people at the time please continue professor so what I've
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:56.920]  found thanks very much to the party archives which are only gradually
[1:17:56.920 --> 1:18:01.360]  opening up so God knows what more is still hidden in the central party
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:07.280]  archives in Beijing but on the basis of what is open now it's unavoidable the
[1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:11.720]  conclusion the conclusion that two to three million people were actually
[1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:16.880]  killed is unavoidable as part of the 45 million people who died
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:21.080]  unnecessarily during those four years and absolutely staggering number of
[1:18:21.080 --> 1:18:26.680]  people the professor what's the grand total though because I see numbers of
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:30.920]  80 million 60 million I mean what's the real number from your research overall
[1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:37.640]  during during the mal rain well the frightening thing is that so far the
[1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:42.760]  only one period after 1949 that we've been able to study on the basis of the
[1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:49.040]  Communist Party archives is the great leap forward from 1958 to 62 when
[1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:54.480]  previous estimates range from 20 to 30 million but on the basis of these
[1:18:54.480 --> 1:19:00.280]  unpublished documents many compiled by by the security police by public
[1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:06.160]  security bureaus themselves that has to go up to 45 million now the question is
[1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:10.280]  what happened during other periods for instance the cultural revolution which
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:15.720]  started a few years later or what happened immediately after 1949 after
[1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:19.760]  the conquest of power by the Communist Party with a reign of terror so far
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:23.160]  people have claimed that two to three million people were killed it might be
[1:19:23.160 --> 1:19:27.240]  much more we simply won't know till we can have access to the archive how does
[1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:31.840]  the US government only happened very short period referred to as the great
[1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:36.000]  leap forward so it's anybody's guess alright professor stay there when a

[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:29.000]  to pass and it's all stated by the United Nations under agenda 21 they cite
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.640]  China as the model to control us I mean you can't make up this nightmare and so
[1:24:33.640 --> 1:24:38.560]  I want you to know the plan here hearing about now and remember Stalin did
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:42.400]  similar things but just not on the same scale we have a again very prestigious
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:46.520]  researcher and professor on with us and we're gonna talk more about the book
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:56.160]  itself that goes into just horrifying detail continuing with your research we
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:58.680]  were getting into the point professor this is a short segment long segment
[1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:04.640]  coming up I was asking the question about 64 million is the number I see from
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:09.520]  the US government where do they come up with that number do you know pure
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:15.120]  speculation pure speculation I really don't believe that anybody's got any way
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:18.600]  of finding out how many died till we have full access to the archives that's
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:25.200]  not going to happen anytime soon but in a four-year period it's 45 mil yeah it
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:31.160]  is so it might be a lot more we we simply don't know what was it like for you
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:37.360]  when you got access to this a and b how did you get access well I didn't
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:41.000]  exactly walk in and asked them to show me all the files about how they went
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.080]  around killing 45 million people and they didn't exactly handed over on the
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:51.240]  golden plate either so it was all very indirect in the sense that I was asking
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:56.600]  to look at economic history of that period and there was a lot of goodwill
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:01.520]  in the couple of years before the Olympics there was a sense of opening
[1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:07.000]  up and making more material available there's a good feel factor and I used
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:13.120]  that time to read as much as I could in several dozen party archives city
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:19.400]  archives county archives provincial archives and in some cases I didn't find
[1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:25.360]  much alone in other cases I simply wouldn't allow to read anything and once
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:31.120]  in a while I got very very lucky and when I read it I have to say I was I was
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:38.640]  quite prepared for for tragedy but nothing nothing like what I encountered
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:43.640]  in the archives I was still under the impression like many others that the
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:48.720]  simply wasn't enough food available and that was why people died of hunger I had
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:55.960]  no idea that the scope the scale of coercion was was so overwhelming I had
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:27:02.840]  no idea that violence was was very much the way in in which those four years
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:09.600]  were governed by the party well professor de Cotter looking at what
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:16.680]  happened in in China in 75 they started the one-child policy as taxes as you
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:22.040]  know and then in 80 as law I mean it seems like China well we know they want
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:26.240]  to get rid of some of their population and I'd seen in the 70s party leaders
[1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:31.280]  saying we would benefit from a nuclear war so as was there an idea that wiping
[1:27:31.280 --> 1:27:36.320]  out the the countryside people you know might be a good thing or or was it
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:42.400]  mismanagement I mean what was it well it's it's it's it's a complex series of
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:48.680]  factors but what you say is actually quite accurate in the sense that at the
[1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:54.720]  time people from the countryside were really seen not just socially but
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:04.040]  legally legally as as inferior to city residents in other words a farmer did
[1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:10.080]  not legally matter as much as as a city resident they were very much treated as
[1:28:10.080 --> 1:28:18.080]  a special caste and during the Great Leap Forward a sort of a sort of war was
[1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:23.120]  built around the city not a real war but the cities were fenced off from the
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:28.120]  countryside well they do that now they lock the rural workers at night in the
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:34.800]  major cities AP reports in basically giant prisons well to this day in fact
[1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:38.800]  any migrant from the countryside can be arrested and locked up and that law
[1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:44.480]  dates from the Great Leap Forward 1958 the whole vibe of the country the real
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:49.680]  line that runs through its society to rule the vibe is countryside people and
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:54.240]  city people and there's no doubt that the vast majority of victims during the
[1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:59.320]  Great Leap Forward tens of millions of people who died were countryside people
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:04.200]  and there's no doubt either that they were pretty much at the very bottom of
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:11.920]  the social hierarchy during that period amazing professor but but again the
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:14.840]  evidence shows as you're saying that the culture was already there to
[1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:20.520]  discriminate against the rural population but why did we then see the
[1:29:20.520 --> 1:29:27.400]  communists do the same thing in Russia and now we see the UN with this
[1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:31.040]  attitude claiming they want to help the rural communities but actually doing
[1:29:31.040 --> 1:29:34.200]  the opposite long segment coming up we're going to get more into your deep
[1:29:34.200 --> 1:29:38.000]  research and your book and how people can get it we're also going to give a

[1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:25.040]  okay we're back live and we're talking to professor de Cotter about Mao
[1:33:25.040 --> 1:33:30.400]  Seitang undoubtedly the greatest mass murderer in human history but I wanted
[1:33:30.400 --> 1:33:36.040]  to read a quote here from the New York Times we actually went and got this from
[1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:40.160]  the microfilm it's in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement David
[1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:43.640]  Rockefeller wrote the New York Times August 10th 73 after returning from a
[1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:46.520]  successful business trip to China whatever the price of the Chinese
[1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:50.480]  Revolution it has obviously succeeded in fostering a high morale and community
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:54.440]  of purpose general social and economic progress is no less impressive the
[1:33:54.440 --> 1:33:59.000]  enormous social advances of China have benefited greatly from the singleness of
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:02.720]  ideology and purpose the social experiment in China under chairman
[1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:06.360]  Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in history and
[1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:10.480]  he goes on in the editorial to praise Mao Seitang we just got some footage from
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:15.200]  one of our associates that's in graphics work for us of the being in
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:19.000]  major Chinese cities with the youth brigades marching with their red flags
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:23.360]  just this year and whenever they want they beat people up I mean you know
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:28.480]  that's all part of the fun and I've got CNN here CNN tells masses that
[1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:33.240]  communism is good for women despite China's nightmare legacy what is it
[1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:37.720]  like for you professor being one of them a most respected researchers on Mao and
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:41.160]  that communist period I mean I'm sure surely you've noticed all the
[1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:44.560]  glorification of Mao in Europe Canada the United States they're putting
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:49.440]  statues up for him there they're basically saying he's a civil rights icon
[1:34:49.440 --> 1:34:56.240]  is that disturbing for you yeah it's quite sickening given that what happened
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:35:01.600]  only during the great leap forward would be enough to qualify as one of the three
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:07.720]  greatest greatest man-made disasters of the 20th century it has it has to be the
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:11.680]  Gulag the Holocaust and the great leap forward the countless the three greatest
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:16.920]  disasters that were pretty much man-made I find it obviously quite quite
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:23.360]  sickening here's a regime that not only destroyed human beings into tens of
[1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:29.880]  millions but also everything else that was in its way that includes untold
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:34.680]  damage to nature during the great leap forward with up to half of the forest
[1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:40.960]  coverage coverage lost housing destroyed up to 40% in some provinces that are
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:47.840]  the size of a European country like France 40% of the housing destroyed in
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:54.840]  the space of four years transportation system that would grind to a halt with
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:35:59.440]  the great leap forward I mean something that's collectivization created such
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:05.080]  damage at every level but the China that existed before 1949 it is just gone
[1:36:05.080 --> 1:36:10.480]  forever and there's the other another kind of damage that was done when people
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:17.040]  are reduced to doing everything in order to survive including eating mud or
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:22.280]  stealing from their own family members and that is the the unraveling of the
[1:36:22.280 --> 1:36:28.360]  social fabric and of moral values altogether you talk about the raping of
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:33.160]  the land the websites frank decoder.com we have links to it up on info wars.com
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:38.880]  and prisonbunna.com I mean why why were they destroying so many homes I read
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:43.000]  something about for quote fertilizer explain that to me well it sounds
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:48.840]  extraordinary but it comes back in in in in every every party document that you
[1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:55.600]  can find from that period that initially mud mud huts were destroyed or pig
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:02.360]  sheds in in in which animals would have left some organic matter that might be
[1:37:02.360 --> 1:37:06.760]  used as fertilizer on the fields but bit by bit entire houses are being
[1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:10.840]  destroyed and houses were destroyed for other reasons not just for fertilizer
[1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:16.640]  but to straighten the roads or to take bricks in order to build up a people's
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:20.960]  commune or a canteen or to punish the people who lived inside because it
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:26.040]  didn't work hard enough or didn't contribute enough grain to the state an extraordinary
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:30.600]  level of destruction and sir I've also read about in this communist system with
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:36.680]  the police they became fat and all these little petty thugs and psychopaths and
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:41.240]  control freaks they all got recruited because a loving good decent person
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:46.000]  couldn't do things like this so it gravitated towards absolute despotism
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:52.520]  can you talk about that psychology it indeed it isn't just people outside the
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:56.840]  party were victims of this but inside the party party members who didn't want to
[1:37:56.840 --> 1:38:01.360]  go along with these policies who objected in some way or another they too
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:07.520]  were expelled purged from the party in the millions in the millions and other
[1:38:07.520 --> 1:38:13.320]  much harder unscrupulous man were recruited to replace them and they were
[1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:18.200]  willing to go along with anything Mao Zedong said they were willing to very
[1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:23.040]  much trim their sails to benefit from these radical winds that were blowing
[1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:29.120]  from P king so what you get is a party of thugs who are very much willing to do
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:33.640]  anything to curry favor with the current with the with the leadership at the
[1:38:33.640 --> 1:38:39.080]  time history repeats itself over and over again and people don't recognize it so
[1:38:39.080 --> 1:38:44.480]  they have to live through it and I see similar trends worldwide today with the
[1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:48.760]  recruiting of thugs but we're in a lot of trouble a professor I want to get
[1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:52.920]  back into your book and tell folks how they get it and and flesh out some of
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:56.640]  the other incredible groundbreaking research that you've gotten from the
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:03.880]  Communist Party archives all over China including local archives but how much
[1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:07.520]  research have you done on the man Mao Zedong because I read about him never
[1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:13.360]  taking a bath having sex with five ten women a day just just just just being a
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:18.760]  singularly disgusting creature that is very true and there is a very good
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:25.560]  biography by Yongchang on Mao Zedong as a person and what comes across when you
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:32.760]  start having access to the minutes of secret leadership meetings is an image
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:37.880]  of a man who is extremely stubborn on the one hand not willing to listen to
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:43.360]  anybody else but like but also extraordinarily vain in the sense that
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:48.760]  nobody including number two and number three down the line down down down the
[1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:54.560]  hierarchy of power are really willing to upset this man and that's linked to a
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:39:58.800]  third characteristic that comes across very clearly and that's paranoia here's
[1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:03.760]  a man who is at the head of a one-party state and is constantly fearing that
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:09.680]  there might be somebody stabbing him in the back somebody undermining him so he
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:17.320]  is very much at the head of a one-party state in which any any any failure to
[1:40:17.320 --> 1:40:23.080]  curry favor or toe the party line results in outright dismissal or much
[1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:30.120]  further down the line to to violence of extraordinary sounds like a bigger scale
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:37.000]  North Korea it's very much a bigger scale North Korea in fact I made the
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:41.680]  comparison about a week ago when I spoke to the independent in England with
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:49.520]  Pol Pot and Pol Pot and the genocide in Cambodia I described it as 20 times what
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:56.400]  happened in Cambodia 20 times what the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot did unbelievable
[1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:00.560]  I want to get back into that period those four years 45 million killed in one
[1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:08.040]  way or the other but looking at the fact that near the end Mao's wife became a
[1:41:08.040 --> 1:41:11.720]  scapegoat though she was just as sickening as he was I want to speak
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:17.160]  about her and then what China has done to get away from that but I know they
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:21.120]  still have the forced labor farming camps I know a lot of that is still there
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:26.640]  it's just hidden in that archipelago throughout the country but but but
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:32.800]  specifically going through the the the overall span of his reign of terror his
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:37.520]  great leap into hell how things ended for Mao Zedong and how he's seen in
[1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:44.000]  China today well Mao Zedong did rather well unlike Adolf Hitler but not
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:49.640]  unlike Joseph Stalin he died very peacefully in his sleep after having
[1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:54.120]  gotten rid of every single one of his enemies including number two at the time
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:58.640]  head of state you shall see and very much allowing number three Joe and
[1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:04.040]  lied diplomat to dive cancer by withholding medical treatment so he was
[1:42:04.040 --> 1:42:09.440]  the one who lived a very long life and died in his sleep how is he considered
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:15.400]  well I'm sometimes told by people in China that he is still held in great
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:21.280]  esteem but the key point really is that even at the time while while he was
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:26.080]  pretty much taking away the grain from ordinary farmers and starving them to
[1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:30.640]  death those very farmers in the countryside who were being starved with
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:37.040]  their children taken away to the army who was sometimes buried alive during that
[1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:42.240]  period they themselves believe that Mao Zedong was a great man and it's a very
[1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:47.200]  simple way of explaining that people need hope they believe that the man at the
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:52.880]  very top is is benevolent they love their servitude and once they buy into
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:58.120]  the Khan they can never say they were wrong indeed it goes back to a very
[1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:02.640]  old traditional way of looking at at things under the Chinese Empire the
[1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:07.760]  emperor's benevolent but his his mandarins are crooked the ones who carry
[1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:15.160]  out his orders are wicked now now going back to his number two having his
[1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:19.080]  health care withheld I had read that I mean that shows that in these tyrannical
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:23.320]  systems whatever permutation they take that it is the people that work for the
[1:43:23.320 --> 1:43:28.160]  system statistically for my you know grazing over wide spectrums of history
[1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:32.200]  that generally the most dangerous position just like with Hitler wiping out
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:35.640]  tens of thousands of his brown shirts that took him to power on the night of
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:40.960]  the long knives that over and over again it is the servants of the dark lord that
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:46.800]  are in the most danger but that that is that is true to a great extent for
[1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:52.840]  instance the cause for revolution is is extremely complex but essentially boils
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:59.680]  down to communist party members purging or killing off or torturing other
[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:05.840]  communist party members it's a great push within the party and that caused
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:11.200]  something like two three million deaths but of course ultimately ordinary people
[1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:15.200]  the ones who died in the tens of millions are exposed have far less
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:20.080]  protection against violence that comes from above than people inside the party
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:24.480]  but you are right nobody would relish to be number two or number three in that
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:29.200]  kind of system and linear linear is a very smart man who tried to stay away
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:34.040]  from it but he too got pulled into it by Mao Zedong himself and he tried to
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:37.880]  flee and of course died in tragic circumstances well professor we see
[1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:43.680]  this this cycle over and over again throughout history that when a
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:50.320]  aggressive group comes in takes over that almost always things get worse not
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:55.040]  better that's why 1776 was so special they really did deliver on almost all
[1:44:55.040 --> 1:45:02.720]  the promises and it was you know the greatest expression of a true leap
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:06.480]  forward for freedom but if you look at the communist if you look at the Nazis
[1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:10.280]  you look at the decline of Rome and I'd like you to speak as a historian on this
[1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:15.960]  if you can just you overall first they take over kill off their you know first
[1:45:15.960 --> 1:45:22.360]  enemy whoever was in power before then they wipe out their the thugs that
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:26.600]  brought them to power and there's always an escalation in the killing you know
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:31.160]  comparatively and then you've got all these killers and psychopaths and sadists
[1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:36.560]  and control freaks they still got the bloodlust the bloodthirsty enjoyment and
[1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:40.960]  the paranoia that goes with it and so then it just accelerates accelerates
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:46.120]  accelerates accelerates yes quite these one-party states whether it's
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:50.440]  under Stalin on the Hitler and the Mao have very similar structures with
[1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:56.360]  similar effects and I think Friedrich Hayek the wonderful writer who wrote this
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:02.520]  book called the road to serve yes road to serve them Hayek saw it very clearly
[1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:07.120]  once you start stripping away every kind of freedom the free freedom of
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:11.920]  association freedom of speech freedom of movement freedom to trade once you
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:17.520]  replace it by a one-party dictate there can only be one road and that's that's
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:21.520]  the road to serve them as he said as he said rather rather clearly I think the
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:26.200]  great leap forward illustrates that better than anything else in 20th
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:30.840]  century history well professor I mean you're obviously a very intelligent
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:35.240]  person you've studied history are you not concerned about global parallels now
[1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:40.800]  with this global corporate elite who use collectivism at the national level to
[1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:47.120]  consolidate power to then combine and and and and move the nation's wealth into
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:51.240]  their corporate arms I mean globalization when you really study what
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:56.160]  it's for as the head of political science at Georgetown wrote Bill Clinton's
[1:46:56.160 --> 1:47:00.560]  mentor that this mega corporate elite they'll fund fascist communist thugs
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:05.600]  our own CIA admits over and over again they'll choose a dictator over an
[1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:09.720]  elected government and more and more we see the classical Western liberties
[1:47:09.720 --> 1:47:16.840]  whether it's England or the United States being dismantled do you ever see
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:23.440]  parallels well what worries me more than anything else is the fact that we still
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:27.920]  have a one-party state in power in the People's Republic of China it's very much
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:33.040]  the same party that committed all these atrocities some 50 years ago now right
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:37.920]  now the number of people who actually see China and the
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:43.120]  authoritarian state it represents as an example to be followed I find that
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:48.320]  extremely worrying and what I find even more worrying is what might happen if
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:53.960]  things go bad economically what if that bubble bursts what would happen with the
[1:47:53.960 --> 1:47:58.360]  People's Republic and a one-party state when things go down downhill
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:02.200]  economically that to me seems to be something we should be paying attention
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:09.720]  to I agree with you professor we'll put your website up on screen the title of
[1:48:09.720 --> 1:48:16.840]  the book Mao's great famine and Frank Decatur is our guest we've got a little
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:20.240]  bit of time left in this segment the next I've been asking a lot of the
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:24.400]  questions what are some of the other big central points and discoveries that you
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:26.920]  make in the book I haven't read it yet I've just seen the reviews but we do have
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:37.960]  a copy ordered well I think it the sheer extent of the amount of
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:42.760]  documentation that that comes out of the party archives I find quite
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:47.000]  extraordinary and I just wonder what happened during other periods on the
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.960]  Communist rule after 1949 when you start looking at 45 million people in four
[1:48:51.960 --> 1:48:56.080]  five years time you just wonder what happened afterwards or on a decade prior
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:04.960]  to that most of all I think that it is not just about trying to see Mao as the
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:09.120]  greatest must murder in human history which of course he is but also trying
[1:49:09.120 --> 1:49:16.480]  to treat the victims of it and try to at least in respect to the memory of
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:22.200]  those many tens of millions who died and try to read about this event and treat
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:27.720]  it with the same degree of respect and knowledge as we treat victims of the
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:33.560]  Holocaust and victims of the Soviet Gulag what I'm trying to say I think is
[1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:38.800]  that people simply don't have a choice or or a voice in the People's Republic
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:42.480]  there is no monument to the to the dead of the great leap forward there's no
[1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:47.200]  museum there's no remembrance we have not publicly recognized even in Western
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:52.680]  media just how horrid this period was and haven't and because it hasn't been
[1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:57.400]  called out there's restaurants all over the US college kids I go back to that
[1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:01.680]  and now I remember I've been on air 15 years 15 years ago our media would
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:06.160]  criticize China and its human rights abuses and its organs selling and the
[1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:10.560]  rest of it now sir I hardly ever hear that that's why it was so refreshing to
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:14.000]  see you coming out and people looking at your research and a lot of media
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:18.960]  admitting yeah I mean this seems like a big step forward towards really
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:27.080]  recognizing this evil indeed I mean that's the tragedy of China becoming
[1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:31.800]  more powerful in world politics is that there are fewer and fewer people actually
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:36.240]  prepared to look at what happened in the past or all for that matter what is
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:39.880]  happening today and that same systems in place now we've got five minutes on the
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:44.480]  other side but recap and expand on the point you were just making professor and
[1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:47.680]  then let's look forward I mean let's look at who they've got there it's the
[1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:52.480]  it's the children and grandchildren of the same totally wicked in bread party
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:56.440]  elite and now they own the majority of US debt and have over 6,000 front
[1:50:56.440 --> 1:51:01.480]  companies here in the US will be right back with the professor hi this is
[1:51:01.480 --> 1:51:05.440]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:08.960]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:12.960]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:16.400]  true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:20.320]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:24.440]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:21.520]  Mal's Great Famine because it mirrors the separate research I've done
[1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:25.480]  obviously not as in depth or directly there at the source this is confirmed
[1:54:25.480 --> 1:54:31.080]  you know point of release from within their own annals and as he said it's
[1:54:31.080 --> 1:54:36.720]  only the surface and it's so horrific we have our own government lighting up the
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:40.080]  Empire State's building and the Communist Chinese colors that's like
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:44.240]  lighting it up as a swastika if we don't recognize that the same system is
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:50.080]  still there my film in game blueprint for global enslavement you can get four
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:54.960]  copies to give to your friends and family of the seminal film for 1995 for
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:54:59.280]  another two weeks this documents our government's own admissions major
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:04.080]  think tanks the UN saying they like what now did I read you a New York Times
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:08.760]  quote from David Rockefeller you see the young kids I see them in UT wearing
[1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:13.680]  Mao and Stalin shirts this is serious this is serious and we've got to stand
[1:55:13.680 --> 1:55:19.960]  up and recognize evil so I hope folks get the film at info wars.com because
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:27.760]  sir finishing up with that point about Howard that the same groups that did
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:36.200]  this are still in control today China owns most of the West debt and where is
[1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:43.880]  China going now well it could I'm not an expert on China today and that's one of
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:48.440]  the troubling things is that the so-called China experts seem always to be
[1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:52.680]  very willing to talk about every aspect of that country whether it happened a
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:56.160]  thousand years ago or what is going to happen in ten years time so I'm very
[1:55:56.160 --> 1:56:01.280]  prudent with that but looking at it I think the real worry is whether there
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:05.040]  is another great leap forward taking place obviously not tens of millions
[1:56:05.040 --> 1:56:11.040]  dying of hunger but again there's great faith by the Chinese government that it
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:17.080]  has somehow found a way to catapult its country past everybody else through some
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:22.400]  magic economic plan that has nothing in common with the rest of the world this
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:27.080]  idea that they can somehow do their own thing in a very different way without
[1:56:27.080 --> 1:56:32.880]  having to pay respect to human beings respect the freedom the freedom of
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:37.560]  movement freedom of association freedom of religion freedom of speech that
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:43.800]  seems to me to be rather rather worrying and in any event it seems to me that if
[1:56:43.800 --> 1:56:48.400]  we really want to understand China now you cannot but read up on this its
[1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:52.600]  history of the past 50 years these are as you said very much the same people in
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:59.560]  power the same families in power the same people in power the same families
[1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:03.920]  becoming fabulously wealthy I mean generals making hundreds of millions of
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:09.320]  dollars and they're killing the fall-on gong they're they're killing peaceful
[1:57:09.320 --> 1:57:14.200]  groups they're still oppressing Tibet and our media more and more defends it
[1:57:14.200 --> 1:57:20.000]  indeed the other query for China experts out there of course not for me as a
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.560]  historian but would be to find out whether or not these methods are being
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:30.200]  exported to other countries oh they certainly are being exported to other
[1:57:30.200 --> 1:57:34.560]  countries I mean that's the that's the issue that I see here and then China's
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:38.680]  got so much influence over our internal politics because they own our debt that
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:41.880]  I mean that's the main reason that the State Department two years ago said
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:45.480]  they're not selling organs when China admits they're selling organs so now
[1:57:45.480 --> 1:57:54.520]  our government's lying for them well that there you go so again is it another
[1:57:54.520 --> 1:58:01.600]  great leap forwards I'd be very prudent it's it's incredible well
[1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:06.880]  Professor Dacotter Frank Dacotter.com is the website I know you're in Rome

[1:58:55.160 --> 1:58:58.920]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:58:58.920 --> 1:59:03.440]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:07.640]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[1:59:07.640 --> 1:59:12.280]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[1:59:12.280 --> 1:59:16.280]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:20.400]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:24.360]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:28.520]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:48.520]  vegetables that's being reported by the newspapers I mean this is incredible
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:55.600]  here's another one 60 days in jail for overgrown grass in New York State WVLA
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:01:00.880]  television and they say it's good here's another one social engineering bill in
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:06.400]  the Senate will force you into city and I've read it is the agenda 21 called
[2:01:06.400 --> 2:01:10.080]  livable communities a blueprint for transformation of society into federal
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:13.200]  control will enforce federal sustainable development zoning and control
[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:16.800]  local communities will create a massive new development bureaucracy will drive
[2:01:16.800 --> 2:01:19.720]  up the cost of energy and heat and cool your home will drive the cost of
[2:01:19.720 --> 2:01:24.000]  gasoline and a way to get in your car will force you to spend thousands of
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:28.440]  dollars in your home in order to comply it's basically the sections of the
[2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:33.040]  carbon tax bill they couldn't get through there's another one US House puts
[2:01:33.040 --> 2:01:37.640]  oceans under UN Senate vote will seal the deal it's got quotes from
[2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:41.640]  congressmen it's past the house John Boehner's office saying yes it's
[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:45.640]  happening probably gonna pass this week or next I mean you I mean this it's HR
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:53.960]  3534 thinly disguised takeover and deals with energy what's our oil drilling
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:57.560]  under UN control remember the UN was created by the mega corporations and
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:01.200]  the Rockefellers so they can sign the authority over to them people keep
[2:02:01.200 --> 2:02:05.960]  saying well the UN created the US created the UN so then why do Americans
[2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:11.320]  want out of the UN or well it's a global corporate construct to then come back
[2:02:11.320 --> 2:02:15.240]  in and take over that's why our trader risk government funds it because it's
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:19.640]  controlled by the very same robber barons now for the rest of this hour
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:23.560]  we're gonna do a quick update later on what's happening with the economy but
[2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:30.320]  we are joined by an amazing lady who we've had on the broadcast before and
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:34.760]  she lives right outside Austin Judith McGeary a lawyer and family farm
[2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:38.560]  operator farm and ranch freedom org earlier this week they just had a
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:42.800]  conference in Austin they've got a house and Senate bill which could be
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:45.960]  interpreted and I've read the language to say you can't make strawberry jam and
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:49.840]  give it to your neighbor or sell it and you see them SWAT teaming Amish and all
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:53.600]  of this happening and it just shows you the mindset we just spent an hour about
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:57.560]  mouse a tongue using food as a weapon now the UN says they'll use food as a
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:01.600]  weapon that's a quote we have our own government saying that they don't want
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:05.860]  you self-sufficient they want you under their control as prisoners and under the
[2:03:05.860 --> 2:03:09.880]  carbon taxes they say Germany's already passed the law by 2020 10 years from now
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:14.840]  no single family homes are allowed they're talking about bulldozing them
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:18.520]  and building smart homes this is total tyranny first they tell you what type of

[2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:53.040]  McGerey of farm and ranch freedom to break down what we're dealing with
[2:10:53.040 --> 2:10:58.480]  Judith tell us how you first got into this the overall view of what's behind
[2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:02.200]  this agenda and as a lawyer being able to research the bills what we're
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:08.160]  currently facing with the legislation you don't ask a lot at one time I got
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:12.680]  into it I at the time I was a practicing attorney and my husband I have our own
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:16.600]  small farm and I heard about the animal identification system and they were
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:20.920]  pushing it here in Texas so the more I researched it the uglier it looked and
[2:11:20.920 --> 2:11:24.280]  I ended up leaving my legal practice and creating the farm and ranch freedom
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:27.680]  alliance along with a group of other farmers and ranchers who were very
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:33.840]  worried about what NAIS could do and so at first our focus was very very
[2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:37.360]  closely focused just on NAIS but the more you get into this the more you
[2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:43.240]  realize how many threats there are and this year we put a lot of energy and a
[2:11:43.240 --> 2:11:47.440]  lot of focus onto the food safety bills in Congress actually for about last year
[2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:53.080]  and a half now we've been doing that because what's happening is that the
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:58.560]  federal government is looking at the food the food system and there are a lot
[2:11:58.560 --> 2:12:01.920]  of really legitimate concerns about food safety in this country I don't feel
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:06.040]  secure about the quality of the food in the grocery stores and unfortunately
[2:12:06.040 --> 2:12:11.960]  that's what 95% of people are eating but the problem is they're using that as an
[2:12:11.960 --> 2:12:17.560]  excuse to create a massive federal regulatory scheme that covers all the
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:22.200]  food in this country you know right down to as you were saying you know someone
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:26.720]  who makes a few jars of jam and you know sells them at a local farmers market
[2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:31.760]  or you know at the local you know park or fair stand or you know flea market you
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:37.360]  know for a couple of weeks a year would be faced with really complicated
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:41.320]  convoluted federal regulation and frankly most of them won't be able to deal
[2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:46.240]  with that that's that's the short version that's the nutshell well let's go
[2:12:46.240 --> 2:12:51.320]  back to the beginning the animal ID premise society how they tried to force
[2:12:51.320 --> 2:12:55.800]  it through now they claim they've backed off but they're just coming back with it
[2:12:55.800 --> 2:13:01.200]  again let's break down the full spectrum takeover big agribusiness on record
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:06.520]  financing this they exempt themselves from most the rules it's clearly designed
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:11.280]  to shut down family farms and ranches they're now trying to say hobby farms
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:17.040]  aren't eligible for small tax exemptions they're doing everything they can to
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:22.280]  shut down the family farm there is a undeclared war going on against our
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:26.200]  family farms and ranches there's been an undeclared war against our family
[2:13:26.200 --> 2:13:29.840]  farms and ranches for a long time you know the official federal government
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:36.160]  policy for decades has been get big or get out and that has been the attitude
[2:13:36.160 --> 2:13:40.240]  and what we've seen whether it's animal ID whether it's the tax exemptions you're
[2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:45.200]  talking about whether it's the food safety bill is that the federal agency
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:50.280]  the USDA and the FDA you know have a revolving door going between them and big
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:55.480]  ag so Michael Taylor who's now the head of food safety at that FDA you know work
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:13:59.880]  for Monsanto went to work for FDA went back to work for a lobbying firm that
[2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:05.320]  worked for Monsanto is now back at FDA and you can find story after story after
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:09.680]  story like that and this is who they talk to it's the only people for the most
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:14.520]  part that they talk to and so they write regulations and they write programs that
[2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:19.440]  are based on the interest of how the big agribusiness companies works the car
[2:14:19.440 --> 2:14:25.440]  guild the Tyson Monsanto ADM grocery manufacturers of America you know all
[2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:31.640]  the big groceries in the country have had a major hand in this bill you know
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:36.760]  this is backwards you know if you want good quality food in this country we
[2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:40.720]  need to get away from the big agribusiness we need to renew our small
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:46.680]  farms have local food people being able to buy from people they trust and focus
[2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:53.120]  on decentralized local food systems and that is not in you know FDA's agenda but
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:57.240]  the good news is but you're on the front lines so correct me if I'm wrong there
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:06.400]  is a renaissance of food co-ops of farmers markets of even lawyers and
[2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:14.040]  doctors and you know well-to-do educated people fleeing to the country becoming
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:20.520]  truly sustainable not the UN eugenics counterfeit of that and people been
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:24.640]  voting with their pocketbook ten years ago you couldn't find organic food on
[2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:30.520]  store shelves now it's everywhere you couldn't find non-gmo hormone milk now
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:34.760]  you can't find the milk with the hormones of course they still sell that
[2:15:34.760 --> 2:15:39.240]  it's added to the other products and cheese and things and from my research a
[2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:43.680]  lot of this attempt to really take over or accelerate the takeover of family
[2:15:43.680 --> 2:15:50.240]  farms and ranches is in response to the movement they're seeing buy people to
[2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:55.560]  basically come out of Babylon I think that's a very good assessment of the
[2:15:55.560 --> 2:15:59.720]  situation there is it's wonderful to watch the local food movement grow and
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:05.320]  it's not just the farmers the farmers and the consumers working together and
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:09.600]  that you know it's critical and we are natural partners the farmers are
[2:16:09.600 --> 2:16:13.080]  producing good food for the consumers and the consumers are providing a fair
[2:16:13.080 --> 2:16:18.800]  living wage for farmers and it's fantastic and if this continues the
[2:16:18.800 --> 2:16:21.840]  children get to drive out once a week to the farms they like they get to see the
[2:16:21.840 --> 2:16:26.320]  cows the goats the chickens then they get the idea to move to the country put
[2:16:26.320 --> 2:16:30.800]  in a few plum trees start making their own jam we start becoming humans again
[2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:35.640]  who are meant to be out in the sunshine and the dirt and we go from being 90
[2:16:35.640 --> 2:16:42.160]  percent urban to maybe 20 30 percent rural that panics the social engineers and
[2:16:42.160 --> 2:16:46.200]  it's and it goes counter to what they've been saying for decades which is the
[2:16:46.200 --> 2:16:50.320]  the stated goal has been to have fewer and fewer farmers I mean it's not a
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:57.400]  secret they think that farming is you know a low-value profession we wanted
[2:16:57.400 --> 2:17:01.600]  few people in it as possible yet people off the land they bring in the
[2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:06.240]  illegals with big agribusiness to undercut the real farms exactly there's
[2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:10.720]  the big meat packer now it's a mechanized war it's a mechanized stated
[2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:16.880]  U.N. plan sorry go ahead well no not at all but the thing is what what we're
[2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:20.120]  describing of this wonderful renaissance as you're saying you ten years ago it's
[2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:25.320]  very hard to get local foods or organic foods in many places and ten years ago
[2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:30.080]  big agribusiness didn't worry about us we were too small to worry about it wasn't
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:34.600]  a big deal now the local foods movement is growing by so many leaps and bounds
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:39.480]  and there's so much energy behind it and so much publicity you know books like
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:43.520]  omnivores dilemma and movies like food ink and I'm gonna say this right now and
[2:17:43.520 --> 2:17:47.480]  then have you continue if you want to defeat the New World Order folks start
[2:17:47.480 --> 2:17:53.280]  a garden it is the act of becoming a human again it is the act of the agrarian
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:57.120]  culture that will bring us back to humanity it's one of the single things
[2:17:57.120 --> 2:18:02.520]  we can do to cut off their power and their control and so this is the
[2:18:02.520 --> 2:18:07.320]  revolution sorry go ahead so I think that's a wonderful statement reconnecting
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:11.080]  with our food growing your own garden it you know getting to know the people who
[2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:15.560]  produce your food going out to the farm reconnecting with the food is central
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:19.000]  and what we have to do is we have to protect it because what's happening is
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:24.320]  there's a huge amount of momentum behind this movement and if it's allowed to
[2:18:24.320 --> 2:18:29.120]  continue it will continue to grow by leaps and bounds and become the dominant
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:34.000]  movement unfortunately if things like Senate bill 510 the current food safety
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:38.520]  bill power then it's likely to really cripple the mood and you notice they've
[2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:42.920]  already built up these paramilitary armies of Enviro police and others
[2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:49.040]  every day I hear about them going after small farms small gardens Amish I mean
[2:18:49.040 --> 2:18:53.440]  SWAT teams undercover at the farmers markets here in Austin there's
[2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:57.720]  undercover cops everywhere I mean they're coming and that's really one of the
[2:18:57.720 --> 2:19:01.240]  core problems we're facing right now specifically you know they've got Senate
[2:19:01.240 --> 2:19:06.240]  bill 510 in the Senate it's been solved there for months but now there's all
[2:19:06.240 --> 2:19:10.680]  this momentum to pass it because of the egg recall you know half a billion eggs
[2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:15.640]  recalled FDA needs more power and that was a mega producer that did that again
[2:19:15.640 --> 2:19:19.320]  but it won't be won't be pointed at them though exactly and that's the thing I
[2:19:19.320 --> 2:19:23.400]  mean what what should be coming out from this eggscare what what people should
[2:19:23.400 --> 2:19:29.280]  realize is that FDA isn't using the power it has now to regulate the big
[2:19:29.280 --> 2:19:34.240]  agribusiness they don't go after the mega factory farms they go after small
[2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:38.640]  co-ops and local producers and raw milk and all of these things FDA doesn't like
[2:19:38.640 --> 2:19:44.560]  and simply giving the same agency more power is not going to improve the food
[2:19:44.560 --> 2:19:48.240]  when it's a revolving door with big agribusiness that states it wants to
[2:19:48.240 --> 2:19:52.600]  shut you down stay there folks you want to be part of the revolution for few

[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:16.760]  poor vision and I really wasn't sleeping well I was a mess pretty much Don
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:20.160]  reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract I started taking
[2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:24.800]  heart and body extract and within a few days I started sleeping a lot better my
[2:23:24.800 --> 2:23:29.360]  blood pressure normalized my blood sugar normalized and my sleep really did
[2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:32.840]  improve experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs

[2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:51.080]  at all about a 7th 8th and 9th day I saw dramatic improvements from taking
[2:23:51.080 --> 2:23:58.160]  heart and body extract details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for
[2:23:58.160 --> 2:24:08.800]  heart and body extract
[2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:12.840]  why do the mega banks the robber barons for the last hundred years fund
[2:24:12.840 --> 2:24:17.720]  communism socialism collectivism under many different names because they run
[2:24:17.720 --> 2:24:23.680]  the show and it doesn't matter what government agency is out there they're
[2:24:23.680 --> 2:24:28.160]  getting bigger and they're treating you like trash now Judith looking at these
[2:24:28.160 --> 2:24:32.400]  houses Senate bills let's go over what's in them I mean because it really does
[2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:35.600]  say you can't can strawberries and sell them without government you know fees
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:39.240]  and regulations and inspectors who just can't wait to get in your house and
[2:24:39.240 --> 2:24:45.320]  they're trying to shut down the farmers markets as you said they are going after
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:49.560]  garage sales I mean they don't want us doing anything that didn't run through a
[2:24:49.560 --> 2:24:53.080]  scanner so they know exactly what you're buying what you're doing let's let's go
[2:24:53.080 --> 2:24:56.440]  over this and how we defeat this legislation but then there's the second
[2:24:56.440 --> 2:25:00.240]  part of the story they're already implementing all this before they even
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:05.040]  have the law in place go ahead what I'd like to focus on is Senate bill 510
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:09.080]  because that's the bill that's active right now and we just got word that
[2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:12.960]  there's a good chance that they'll be voted on next week so you know that is
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:18.360]  where the action's happening right now and there's a lot in this bill it's 225
[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:22.600]  pages long I'm going to focus on just a few core provisions out of it
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:28.000]  there's one section that's what they call produce safety standards and this is
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:32.480]  applied to anyone who is growing you know fruits and vegetables for sale
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:37.160]  include you know local CSAs people selling to farmers markets farm to school
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:39.680]  yeah you're not going to sell peaches on the side of the road they're going to
[2:25:39.680 --> 2:25:43.080]  swat team you and I mean they do they have an undercover cop come up buy a
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:47.440]  peach and then they get to arrest you so the first stage before you get to the
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:50.520]  enforcement stage though the first stage is they're going to be telling you
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:54.480]  they're gonna be adopting regulations on how to grow and harvest these crops
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:58.880]  the FDA is going to be empowered to say here's what kind of water you can use
[2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:03.760]  what standards you need to meet for your compost when you could use animal
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:07.720]  manure when you can't use animal manure whether you need toilets in an area what
[2:26:07.720 --> 2:26:12.480]  your workers need to wear what you need to wear what you need to wash in you
[2:26:12.480 --> 2:26:17.400]  know really long extensive regulations and you know this is something by way
[2:26:17.400 --> 2:26:21.160]  FDA is already working on as you said even without this bill FDA is looking
[2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:25.720]  at trying to adopt these kinds of regulations and you would have to right
[2:26:25.720 --> 2:26:31.080]  now there are no exemptions right now the way the bill is written if you grow a
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:35.120]  large backyard garden and you take your excess produce to the local farmers
[2:26:35.120 --> 2:26:39.280]  market because what else are you going to do with all that squash you'd have to
[2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:43.320]  comply with federal regulation on how you grew that so it's a federal takeover
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:48.880]  of just everything it's incredibly extensive and we've never seen anything
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:53.240]  like it this is this is very different even from the power that I already have
[2:26:53.240 --> 2:26:56.720]  well our health care is government run now I mean this is the new America so
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:00.880]  that's one big section the next section that I like what I try to focus on is
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:05.040]  what you're talking about in terms of jam making it applies to anyone who does
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:08.040]  any kind of food processing and that means
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:13.440]  jam making cheese making bread making you know someone who makes pies someone makes
[2:27:13.440 --> 2:27:16.520]  undried tomatoes you know pretty much if you take raw ingredients and you change
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:20.840]  them in any form or and they're already using local zoning under agenda 21
[2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:25.480]  written by the UN to arrest people for uncut grass for gardens I mean it's
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:30.360]  already happening and this and what happened now it or what would happen if
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:35.480]  that bill 510 passes is that you know all these folks who are doing small scale
[2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:40.200]  you know food production would again come under federal regulation and for
[2:27:40.200 --> 2:27:44.960]  food processing it's something called a half of a hazard analysis and critical
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:50.560]  control point plan or they also have another fridge HHARPC they boil down to
[2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:55.280]  the same thing and then basically food wardens like game wardens you know the
[2:27:55.280 --> 2:27:58.960]  kid that was a control freak in school now he's got a gun on his side and he's
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:03.480]  coming well and you have to come so for you know so federal agent will come and
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:08.240]  you'll have to create a very large convoluted paperwork plan that tells
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:11.880]  you know exactly where there could be a problem what you're going to do about it
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:14.880]  how you're going to monitor it how you're going to test it what corrective
[2:28:14.880 --> 2:28:19.880]  action you're going to take you just really detailed and it's up to their
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:23.040]  approval so if they don't like what you've written they can say go back and
[2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:27.000]  do it again hey but that's like now is greatly forward I mean the government's
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:32.560]  going to help us you know it's you know there is there are a lot of problems at
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:37.800]  the at the big agribusiness big at you know big food level but you know we're
[2:28:37.800 --> 2:28:42.000]  not seeing problems you have local can makers yeah and folks are fine and folks
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:45.240]  are finding out the local markets are better and that's not going to be allowed
[2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:49.320]  so here come the police it's gonna be you know it's one of those things that it's
[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:52.040]  gonna I'm not sure I say won't be allowed but it's gonna be a lot more
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:54.760]  difficult it's gonna be one of the things that we're gonna go from this
[2:28:54.760 --> 2:28:59.640]  thriving vibrant growing movement to you know a few people trying to hold on
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:03.320]  yeah no they're gonna nickel and I mean listen they already have undercover
[2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:06.800]  police at the Austin markets I mean they're already out there they're not
[2:29:06.800 --> 2:29:10.680]  arresting the illegal aliens kidnapping people they're there harassing old women
[2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:14.880]  selling strawberries and you know the bigger it gets the harder it is you know
[2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:18.960]  we can when it's at a local level when it's at a state level you at least have
[2:29:18.960 --> 2:29:22.480]  the opportunity to go face-to-face with folks go up to the state capital and talk
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:26.040]  with them when it gets I don't know I tried talking to some state police this
[2:29:26.040 --> 2:29:29.880]  morning and they looked right at me and they said you get in your car and you
[2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:34.480]  get out of here get out of here you're to stay there long segment coming up you
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:37.520]  be able to roll through all these subsections and the enforcement areas
[2:29:37.520 --> 2:29:41.520]  will tie it into a gender 21 a lot of other things like liberal communities
[2:29:41.520 --> 2:29:46.200]  act going through folks you want to live in Soviet China communist China you're
[2:29:46.200 --> 2:29:49.320]  gonna get a front-row seat doing every control Frick's gonna be squatting on

[2:31:03.800 --> 2:31:07.800]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:12.040]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[2:31:12.040 --> 2:31:16.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[2:31:16.320 --> 2:31:20.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[2:31:20.680 --> 2:31:24.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[2:31:24.760 --> 2:31:29.320]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[2:31:29.320 --> 2:31:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[2:31:33.440 --> 2:31:37.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[2:31:37.400 --> 2:31:41.240]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[2:31:41.240 --> 2:31:43.960]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[2:33:07.240 --> 2:33:14.000]  leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones on
[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:19.760]  the GCN radio network if you want to know where all of this is coming from it's
[2:33:19.760 --> 2:33:25.400]  agenda 21 of the United Nations all the major governments work with them the
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:30.880]  Chinese government loves it it's what they did with the Great Leap Forward
[2:33:30.880 --> 2:33:36.880]  literally I had a top professor on a grain last hour and it's total control
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:41.200]  you control food and water you control it all don't collect rainwater you know
[2:33:41.200 --> 2:33:46.120]  a month in jail here's a headline 60 days in jail for overgrown grass in New
[2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:52.240]  York State WVLA they want to pack their presence now they were giving people
[2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:56.960]  jail time here in Austin for three inch grass mainly old folks I went and showed
[2:33:56.960 --> 2:34:00.800]  city council people with two foot grass the health department with foot tall
[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:06.280]  grass and they shut it down real quick but you got to stand up against these
[2:34:06.280 --> 2:34:13.800]  crooks I mean it's a parasitic government in almost every level and the
[2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:17.320]  the local rules are federally internationally written they've got
[2:34:17.320 --> 2:34:26.920]  international zoning law SB 1 9 1 6 1 9 SB 1 6 1 9 the livable communities
[2:34:26.920 --> 2:34:32.320]  which is a biodiversity smart growth situation and their stated goal is the
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:35.720]  end of our industrial society and that includes farming and they've also got
[2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:39.280]  new rules they're trying to push and even if they can't have Congress pass it
[2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:45.400]  they're saying any dust from tilling is not allowed any dust unless you buy
[2:34:45.400 --> 2:34:50.720]  variances like big agribusiness does and that's all the cases years ago in the
[2:34:50.720 --> 2:34:54.640]  Associated Press where there'd be thousands of violations at Tyson
[2:34:54.640 --> 2:35:00.160]  plants in Arkansas and they wouldn't get in trouble but then some little plant
[2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:06.000]  would get one violation to be shut down going back to Judith McGurray of the
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:10.880]  groups that are out there fighting all of this I appreciate her joining us the
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:14.200]  websites farm and ranch freedom.org they're trying to pass this bill next
[2:35:14.200 --> 2:35:18.080]  week let's continue walking through some of the things it does and then let's get
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:22.640]  into the enforcement arm and then how we fight this Judith. So another one of
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:26.640]  things it does is it provides this is partly enforcement but they don't phrase
[2:35:26.640 --> 2:35:30.600]  as enforcement it provides that FDA can charge you for the cost of the
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:34.780]  reinfection so let's say they come through your little commercial kitchen
[2:35:34.780 --> 2:35:38.200]  where you're making you know a small amount of jam for the local market and
[2:35:38.200 --> 2:35:43.800]  they find you've done something wrong one one violation they can charge the
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:49.560]  cost of coming back and you know charge their travel expenses charge their
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:53.880]  staff rates you know put the financial burden on that small little
[2:35:53.880 --> 2:35:58.480]  jam maker which creates a wonderful incentive for FDA to keep telling small
[2:35:58.480 --> 2:36:02.160]  producers no you've done something wrong. Let's remember the FDA for more than
[2:36:02.160 --> 2:36:07.960]  several decades allows certain amounts of cockroach parts cockroach feces rat
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:13.480]  droppings rat hair in the food legally but you're not gonna be on that standard
[2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:18.640]  if they don't like how your kitchen looks and doesn't have an OSHA runway to
[2:36:18.640 --> 2:36:23.200]  it you know you're gonna have trouble. And that's one of the core issues here is
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:28.280]  FDA's discretion there were a lot of changes made to this bill that were
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:33.600]  intended to sort of be good for small and sustainable farms you know it but
[2:36:33.600 --> 2:36:38.080]  they all come down to FDA's discretion so FDA is supposed to provide
[2:36:38.080 --> 2:36:42.720]  flexibility FDA is supposed to take into consideration diverse farming
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:48.120]  practices FDA can choose to exempt small-scale producers but all of it goes
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:53.800]  down to what FDA chooses to do and their track record is not one of helping
[2:36:53.800 --> 2:36:58.160]  small-scale producers in fact it's completely the opposite and so
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:00.600]  unfortunately though a lot of the senators are looking at this and saying
[2:37:00.600 --> 2:37:03.920]  but we've addressed the issues for small farms don't worry there's
[2:37:03.920 --> 2:37:07.880]  flexibility there's consideration there's extended deadline there's no death
[2:37:07.880 --> 2:37:12.200]  panels in the bill yeah so but and I think some of the staff literally doesn't
[2:37:12.200 --> 2:37:16.280]  understand it I mean to be fair to them I think they they don't understand the
[2:37:16.280 --> 2:37:19.600]  reality of what it means to be farming on the ground what it means to be a
[2:37:19.600 --> 2:37:23.660]  small-scale producer and they need to hear from people you know they need we
[2:37:23.660 --> 2:37:28.440]  need calls going into the state to the senators right now saying you know you
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:32.400]  either need to kill this bill or at the very least exempt out the small-scale
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:36.840]  producer. But you've seen all the videos of the Amish and others being rated by
[2:37:36.840 --> 2:37:41.400]  police with guns drawn I mean you've seen those countless videos coming out
[2:37:41.400 --> 2:37:46.440]  were they coming to name guns at people you know we have small food co-ops yeah
[2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:52.320]  I mean it's scary what's going on it is very scary what is going on and it's
[2:37:52.320 --> 2:37:58.480]  at every level and right now it's scattered incidents but the problem is
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:02.240]  anytime one of those incidents happens all of us are in small-scale production
[2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:07.560]  look around go ooh could that be us next you know it's it's terrifying to live
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:11.200]  with this idea that the guy you know significant chunks of the government
[2:38:11.200 --> 2:38:15.000]  don't like small-scale producers and I'll say you know and Alex you know I may
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:18.280]  disagree on this but I've talked to some of the government officials at
[2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:21.760]  different levels state local federal and there are individuals in that who are
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:27.160]  who are good folks who do support us who do want to see local food. Judith the same
[2:38:27.160 --> 2:38:31.000]  thing in communist China or Nazi Germany there were Nazis that tried to save
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:37.480]  Jews the issue here is the dominant is the direction at the top we know is the
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:41.640]  shut down family farms as you said earlier that's admitted and I mean we
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:44.920]  have John P. Holdren head of the White House Science Department saying the
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:48.680]  saying they want to destroy an industry and literally knock us back to the
[2:38:48.680 --> 2:38:52.680]  Stone Age I played that clip on Sunday so yes there are a lot of people that
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:56.640]  don't like what they're doing but it doesn't matter they still do it yeah
[2:38:56.640 --> 2:39:00.320]  no I agree I just wanted to put in because I deal with some of these good
[2:39:00.320 --> 2:39:05.080]  folks on a regular basis but the problem is the policies that the people in
[2:39:05.080 --> 2:39:10.080]  charge the dominant theme is get this bill get bigger get out and they're
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:13.560]  still listening to big agribusiness and they're still supporting and and
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:19.040]  promoting big agribusiness and the bill gives them every bit of flexibility they
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:24.600]  need to continue doing that they can continue to basically give a lot of big
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:29.400]  food and big agribusiness a free ride and you know slam down on small scale
[2:39:29.400 --> 2:39:37.200]  producers and you know the way that bill is written right now absolutely so what
[2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:40.600]  do we do we call Congress are there any key senators to call about this bill I
[2:39:40.600 --> 2:39:45.200]  think I think the key is to call the senators from your state so whatever
[2:39:45.200 --> 2:39:48.880]  right now that's so you're gonna have influence with I'd encourage everyone to
[2:39:48.880 --> 2:39:53.840]  call both senators remember you have two senators from your state you know I hope
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:57.760]  you know who they are everybody if you don't you can just call the capital
[2:39:57.760 --> 2:40:04.600]  switch board line it's two zero two two two four three one two one and ask you
[2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:10.600]  know say I live in Texas I want to talk to my senators and tell them to amend or
[2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:15.880]  oppose that bill 510 there is going to be an amendment proposed to exempt small
[2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:19.480]  scale direct marketing producers from the proof from the two provisions we've
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:23.560]  been talking our K. Bailey Hutchinson Bilderberg member and Cornyn
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:30.080]  supporting s 510 we don't have commitments from them either way yet they
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:35.920]  have not they have not publicly taken positions yet and there's a new twist
[2:40:35.920 --> 2:40:40.360]  speaking of enforcement which we serve skimmed over that there may be an
[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:45.320]  amendment introduced to also add criminal penalty of course so up till now
[2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:49.480]  there haven't been criminal penalties on that bill but Senator Leah Vermont
[2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:54.120]  introduced the bill last week to add criminal penalties and word is that it
[2:40:54.120 --> 2:40:58.560]  may get hacked on as an amendment to send a bill 510 what are the prospects
[2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:03.880]  for the bill I mean I mean is it looking bad like it's gonna pass you know
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:07.120]  this thing I've given up trying to predict those things I've made so many
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:12.720]  incorrect predictions on it in the last year Alex we sender Coburn from
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:18.120]  Oklahoma is very strongly opposing passage of the bill currently he is main
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:22.140]  issue that he's talked about the most is the financial impact of it and the
[2:41:22.140 --> 2:41:26.640]  fact that it would increase the debt you know this is unfunded mandate but
[2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:30.200]  there's some indication that they may be able to work that out and bring the
[2:41:30.200 --> 2:41:35.240]  bill to a vote next week I think if it comes to a vote it will pass I think if
[2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:39.280]  it comes to the floor of the Senate there are gonna be enough senators who
[2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:42.480]  don't want a headline that reads you know sender so-and-so opposes food safety
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:51.720]  bill that it will ultimately pass if it comes to a vote so it's a room for it
[2:41:51.720 --> 2:41:56.600]  not to vote and B if it comes to vote we need an amendment to exempt our small
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:42:00.280]  scale producers it's not perfect it's not the optimum you know it's not
[2:42:00.280 --> 2:42:03.560]  everything I would have wanted but it's a good strong amendment that's being
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:08.120]  proposed by senator tester and they just sell this hysteria of oh something's on
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:12.440]  the spinach coming from big factory farms oh you know the eggs again big
[2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:16.960]  mega farm big production facility meanwhile I've done the research
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:21.960]  listen to Derry Brownfield has constant guests on covering this it's on record
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:28.600]  that they do almost nothing to look at pork beef poultry produce coming out of
[2:42:28.600 --> 2:42:33.800]  Latin America coming out of Asia it's almost all the enforcement is just
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:38.720]  harassing the living daylights out of small farms and ranches and again that's
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:42.880]  not going to really change under this bill the bill does have provision to
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:47.440]  deal with foreign facilities but there are two big catches to that the biggest
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:51.560]  catch is it deals with third-party certifiers so you know they're gonna
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:57.320]  go higher companies in China to inspect Chinese facility well we also have the
[2:42:57.320 --> 2:43:01.800]  FDA saying melamine and milk is not bad for children pull up the AP headline
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:05.920]  melamine not you know some melamine not bad for children so something that
[2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:10.760]  causes kidney failure and death they say that's okay from China but Judith
[2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:16.000]  McGarry she's not gonna make a blackberry jam exactly I mean what we need
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:22.720]  the track record of imported food is very poor I mean very very bad and the
[2:43:22.720 --> 2:43:26.240]  idea that third-party certification that hiring companies within those
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:32.920]  countries is going to somehow solve the problem really sort of defies normal
[2:43:32.920 --> 2:43:36.800]  common sense and defies the track record it defies what we've seen happening I
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:41.800]  spoke with one of my folks actually who has a supplement company and he was
[2:43:41.800 --> 2:43:46.800]  telling me he brings in ingredients from China he does but they they do quality
[2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:50.600]  control and kept hiring companies in China to trade you quality control over
[2:43:50.600 --> 2:43:55.800]  there and every time it failed you know big every time the company you know the
[2:43:55.800 --> 2:44:00.800]  quality control folks basically sold out and he had to you know return a bunch of
[2:44:00.800 --> 2:44:04.880]  stuff and keep doing the quality control here and he's a private company and he
[2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:10.680]  chooses to do that did you know about 92% or more but the numbers us here 92% of
[2:44:10.680 --> 2:44:18.600]  our vaccines are now made in China you know that's a terrifying number but
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:25.880]  again that's not the problem though it's it's it's people selling pumpkins and
[2:44:25.880 --> 2:44:29.720]  it's you know they say that and I hear you know I hear health inspectors talk
[2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:34.120]  about how dangerous food in the open air is oh it's amazing they're scared of
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:38.280]  open air and the track record again I like going to track record I like going
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:42.920]  to what have we seen we don't see foodborne illnesses coming out of the
[2:44:42.920 --> 2:44:47.560]  small producers you know occasionally very small very sporadic and the media
[2:44:47.560 --> 2:44:53.080]  tropics it when it does but but it's so rare and when it does happen you know
[2:44:53.080 --> 2:44:56.320]  immediately where it comes from you know immediately how to stop it it's not
[2:44:56.320 --> 2:45:00.600]  you know it's not a widespread issue let's give the bottom line you know they
[2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:06.480]  irradiate the meat they MSG all this stuff they know it's the big mega
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:10.880]  producers that are as dirty as you can imagine and they know they can't compete
[2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:15.480]  with good locally produced food that's organic and non GMO and they know
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:18.240]  there's a rebellion worldwide to it everything that's happening here is
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:21.400]  happening worldwide because this is you and written as I said earlier what are
[2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:25.800]  some other attacks separate from the bill s510 that folks need to really get
[2:45:25.800 --> 2:45:31.160]  on today tomorrow and next week but but what are some of the other attacks I
[2:45:31.160 --> 2:45:35.160]  know there's a lot of other stuff going on I see the IRS three years ago saying
[2:45:35.160 --> 2:45:39.880]  hey if your farmer ranch doesn't make money you work in town but still run it
[2:45:39.880 --> 2:45:44.480]  just to keep your farm to pay the taxes that's not enough we're gonna get rid of
[2:45:44.480 --> 2:45:48.240]  any tax exemptions you have I mean they're really pulling the stops out I
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:53.080]  think that gosh the list of threats is so long I mean right now the most
[2:45:53.080 --> 2:45:57.000]  immediate one is Senate bill 510 I mean that's the one that is happening right
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:02.120]  now no long-term animal ID is still out there it's not dead it's still a
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:07.840]  continuing issue we've got issues of GMO there's a lot of fighting there's
[2:46:07.840 --> 2:46:10.840]  actually very current fight happening over genetically engineered salmon and
[2:46:10.840 --> 2:46:15.560]  you know they managed to push through oh yeah the FDA is gonna approve a GMO
[2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:19.920]  cross species that's had insect genes added and will extinct regular salmon
[2:46:19.920 --> 2:46:24.840]  major universities have found that's okay though well yeah I mean according to
[2:46:24.840 --> 2:46:30.360]  FDA it is but we've got chance to fight it exactly that's okay animal go ahead
[2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:34.720]  sorry I said this is a key fight because it would be the first animal so you know
[2:46:34.720 --> 2:46:40.560]  if we can stop them from approving it it puts a major you know a major barrier in
[2:46:40.560 --> 2:46:44.400]  their way if they approve it well guess what the next thing on the list is
[2:46:44.400 --> 2:46:49.000]  genetically engineered pigs so you know Center for Food Safety is doing
[2:46:49.000 --> 2:46:53.520]  excellent work on the genetically engineered salmon issue and that's a
[2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:58.600]  very current and very immediate issue there's also regulations that are trying
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:47:03.360]  to reduce the control of the big agribusinesses over the market just
[2:47:03.360 --> 2:47:08.840]  the livestock market and we're working on that issue and co-coordination with
[2:47:08.840 --> 2:47:12.360]  other groups and trying to get rules passed and that's coming up over the
[2:47:12.360 --> 2:47:16.520]  next couple of months so you know there's this back and forth we're fighting it
[2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:20.240]  back against agribusiness and trying to break that control and at the same time
[2:47:20.240 --> 2:47:24.200]  trying to prevent them from getting new bad legislation and regulations then
[2:47:24.200 --> 2:47:28.120]  well going back to the salmon here's all these fake environmentalists that
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:32.440]  want to put taxes on carbon dioxide that plants breathe meanwhile they want to
[2:47:32.440 --> 2:47:37.760]  approve a salmon which in major controlled trials kills and extinct the
[2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:41.360]  other natural salmon and it's a genetically engineered cross species
[2:47:41.360 --> 2:47:46.560]  clone I mean this is incredible and they allow open-air planning of GMO
[2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:51.200]  cross species plants everywhere that major studies show are killing the bees
[2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:56.480]  you name it they don't care about that they want to send inspectors to your
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:48:04.120]  pecan farm to your orange orchard they want to shut down your I mean it's just
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:07.080]  outrageous Judith and thank God you're there fighting these people what are some
[2:48:07.080 --> 2:48:12.720]  of the other threats to let folks know briefly I'm running out of issues that
[2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:16.040]  not that running out there are so many but those are the immediate ones and
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:20.560]  that's how I tend to focus because God knows we've got our hands full and GMO
[2:48:20.560 --> 2:48:25.320]  is a big one and we had it was the most popular talk at our conference we had a
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:30.040]  farmer who's doing research on the effects of GMOs on health speak at our
[2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:36.160]  conference and he showed pictures of what GMO corn is doing to pick stomach you
[2:48:36.160 --> 2:48:40.480]  know what animals are fed GMO corn here's what their stomachs look like and
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:45.120]  you look at them and you feel sick and you go oh hmm everybody I know with
[2:48:45.120 --> 2:48:50.560]  Crohn's disease digestive problems the heartburn I wonder if that might be
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:54.480]  because most of the corn and soybeans in this country are GMO you know it's
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:49:00.040]  it's really scary GMO to produce their own pesticide in them so if bugs eat it
[2:49:00.040 --> 2:49:05.200]  they die but then they feed it to us gee that's not hard to figure out and you
[2:49:05.200 --> 2:49:09.240]  know we're the sad thing is I've actually seen a lot of information a lot of
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:13.120]  people out there saying things like GMOs reduce the use of herbicide well the
[2:49:13.120 --> 2:49:17.200]  major GMO crops the most widespread ones are what's called roundup ready
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:22.360]  crops the whole point of them is that you can plant them and then spray the
[2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:26.480]  fields with roundup herbicide without killing the crop you just kill
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:31.520]  everything else but the whole point of these GMO crops frankly is to allow for
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:49:36.840]  increased use of herbicides yeah but they have all the BT stuff that that grows
[2:49:36.840 --> 2:49:40.400]  a pesticide in the plant it's a pharmacological crop that too that's
[2:49:40.400 --> 2:49:45.120]  that's another branch of them so you know the GMOs you know despite with the
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:49.360]  GE salmon their fights over sugar beet going on genetically engineered sugar
[2:49:49.360 --> 2:49:53.680]  beet genetically engineered alfalfa these are ongoing fights that are
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:57.800]  happening and they are incredibly important because the problem is you
[2:49:57.800 --> 2:50:01.840]  can't choose to really opt out of the system easily because of the reasons you
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:06.720]  were just saying the fish escape the crops cross pollinate you know the only
[2:50:06.720 --> 2:50:10.920]  way to protect ourselves is to start limiting the use of these GMOs well
[2:50:10.920 --> 2:50:13.880]  Judith we're out of time I look forward to having you on in the near future
[2:50:13.880 --> 2:50:17.360]  God bless you I want to get you in studio I know you live outside awesome on your
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:21.280]  family farm and I think another thing is for everybody to Google local food
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:25.520]  co-ops or farmers markets start going out the journey of a thousand miles
[2:50:25.520 --> 2:50:30.080]  starts with a single step if we move this movement of real local healthy food
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:34.520]  and really make it grow even faster they that'll give them even more targets to
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:39.040]  go after resistance is victory we're gonna come back and cover some financial
[2:50:39.040 --> 2:50:43.280]  news but I really appreciate you spending time with us today farm and
[2:50:43.280 --> 2:50:48.440]  ranchfreedom.org the bills s510 call your senators thank you Judith thank
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:51.920]  you Alex wonderful lady we're gonna come back hit some of the latest news on
[2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:56.680]  the economy and the police state on the other side of this quick break we're
[2:50:56.680 --> 2:51:00.080]  fighting tyranny make no mistake

[2:54:53.380 --> 2:55:01.200]  terrorists in effort to break back of big government resistance and it gets
[2:55:01.200 --> 2:55:05.080]  into we've got a group coming on tomorrow a state representative put on the

[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:44.200]  they need to and I'm sorry I don't think a big Republican takeover of Congress is
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:47.840]  going to fix everything it shows the people are waking up though I mean we're
[2:55:47.840 --> 2:55:52.880]  in such serious times and this depression is real this is so real what's
[2:55:52.880 --> 2:55:57.360]  happening and if we just wake up to it the nightmare can end the world will
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:01.840]  never be a perfect place but we've got a lot better chance in reversing all of
[2:56:01.840 --> 2:56:06.760]  this tyranny and corruption that we've got to study history we've got to see the
[2:56:06.760 --> 2:56:11.040]  facts and we're reaching so many new people every day thanks to you spreading
[2:56:11.040 --> 2:56:14.440]  the word about info wars dot com and prison planet dot com making the search

[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:21.680]  stage a terror attack I mean we're really having effect in the systems doing
[2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:25.280]  everything they can try to block us and shut us down and restrict people coming
[2:56:25.280 --> 2:56:28.880]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and we've got more and more foreign
[2:56:28.880 --> 2:56:32.320]  countries trying to block us from people being able to get to us and that's
[2:56:32.320 --> 2:56:36.920]  because we're effective here at the very end of this hour because gold went up to

[2:56:43.480 --> 2:56:48.760]  briefly bring Ted Anderson up Ted watching this situation it's better
[2:56:48.760 --> 2:56:53.960]  sweet yeah we're right again but it's because the Federal Reserve is buying
[2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:57.800]  US debt instead of foreign governments or individuals I mean and more and more
[2:56:57.800 --> 2:57:03.040]  they they're signaling that it is the long march into depression yeah you're
[2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:06.440]  right about that and that's why you're seeing so many institutional buyers get
[2:57:06.440 --> 2:57:11.360]  into gold and so many people walk away from the dollar I mean just about every
[2:57:11.360 --> 2:57:16.400]  newsletter service every even you know places like Bloomberg and Reuters are
[2:57:16.400 --> 2:57:19.760]  saying buy gold you have to buy gold they're not it's not like they're even

[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:31.240]  a low of 1286 you know what that means it means we could see $1300 an ounce
[2:57:31.240 --> 2:57:35.640]  before the end of this week I'm gonna emphasize could but we're so close to it
[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:41.560]  Alex that it would only take a $5 up tick and we're over $13 an hour $1300 an
[2:57:41.560 --> 2:57:45.960]  ounce in gold well Chad you've got silver the silver half dollars at 1050 a
