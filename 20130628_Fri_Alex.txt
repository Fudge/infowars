[00:19.120 --> 00:44.080]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is Friday the 28th day of June 2013
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.480]  we're going to be live here for the next three hours and I'm very excited that
[00:49.480 --> 00:56.360]  Gerald Salente is here in Austin Texas and is going to be in studio with us
[00:56.360 --> 01:00.080]  need to button my top button for TV viewers looks like I'm trying to be a
[01:00.080 --> 01:05.960]  David Hasselhoff wannabe but only Paul Watson who's actually the illegitimate
[01:05.960 --> 01:12.840]  son of David Hasselhoff can actually pull it off in fact he is secretly I'm
[01:12.840 --> 01:17.120]  planning to roll this out very soon secretly ladies and gentlemen he is
[01:17.120 --> 01:24.400]  the Wasselhoff anyways that's that's secretly his name now it's not now
[01:24.400 --> 01:27.400]  it's not secret anymore if you're a radio listener you're like what are you
[01:27.400 --> 01:32.520]  talking about I came in here with my top button unbuttoned and it looked like I
[01:32.520 --> 01:38.280]  was in a 70s 70s porno movie or something with the chest hair ladies and
[01:38.280 --> 01:42.480]  gentlemen all I need is a big gold chain with a crucifix on it or something
[01:42.480 --> 01:46.920]  and we've got the whole the whole nine yards prepared and then I could be well
[01:46.920 --> 01:53.800]  not quite a big be wearing a a jungle type shirt or a tropical shirt at the
[01:53.800 --> 01:59.520]  right word for one of those a tropical shirt I've decided today coming in here
[01:59.520 --> 02:03.840]  I was exercising this morning getting more and more angry about the new world
[02:03.840 --> 02:07.080]  order getting more and more upset about all the things that are happening in the
[02:07.080 --> 02:11.280]  world but I really should be positive because so many people are actually
[02:11.280 --> 02:16.240]  starting to wake up and I think that's just incredibly good news and so I
[02:16.240 --> 02:20.960]  shouldn't be so negative and plus life is not boring this is a huge action
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.000]  adventure we're all starring in it we're only alive once on this beautiful
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.800]  planet hurtling through space and I'm gonna try to bring more light to the
[02:28.800 --> 02:32.480]  show because there is a lot of good in the world a lot of good in the universe
[02:32.480 --> 02:36.760]  in fact there's a lot more good than bad I tend to focus on the bad because I
[02:36.760 --> 02:41.520]  want the good to become aware of it so that we can burn the tyranny politically
[02:41.520 --> 02:47.360]  spiritually intellectually to the ground and its pyre be a white house on the
[02:47.360 --> 02:52.920]  hill for future generations to try to avoid the pitfalls that we have fallen
[02:52.920 --> 02:56.920]  into and that other generations before us fell into I mean I just love
[02:56.920 --> 03:03.440]  humanity I I'm a fan of our potential but it's kind of an oxymoron dichotomy in
[03:03.440 --> 03:08.640]  that I'm also disgusted by the lows of humanity and my own loss and just the
[03:08.640 --> 03:14.680]  wanton sloth and decadence and loving failure and loving gibbering and lying
[03:14.680 --> 03:19.840]  and delusionalism and no good deed goes unpunished I tell you that African
[03:19.840 --> 03:25.720]  saying is the most true saying in the world that no good deed goes unpunished
[03:25.720 --> 03:32.200]  but it doesn't go unrewarded as well the overall you'll be blessed your
[03:32.200 --> 03:36.400]  progeny will be blessed but you will be attacked and Christ said that to he said
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.480]  you know those that love me will be persecuted and all those that hate me
[03:40.480 --> 03:47.920]  love death and people that want to be good will be persecuted by the corrupt
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.000]  because they don't like us ladies and gentlemen and we need to realize that and
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.360]  we need to be a little more uppity about things those of us that know we're
[03:55.360 --> 04:00.080]  good know that we care know that liberty and individualism is the way to go
[04:00.080 --> 04:04.840]  we've got to take our lives back take our country back take our government back
[04:04.840 --> 04:08.800]  and that's what I'm here to talk about today ladies and gentlemen the news
[04:08.800 --> 04:12.160]  we're going to cover when we get back is all off the chart did you know this
[04:12.160 --> 04:16.120]  hasn't broken in the US yet but it's a big deal Canadians are calling it
[04:16.120 --> 04:21.240]  Nazi Germany that's how it's described I'm going to get to that after the break
[04:21.240 --> 04:25.840]  they have had Katrina style gun confiscation there and we're going to be
[04:25.840 --> 04:30.600]  going over that immigration reform bill clears Senate but faces roadblock in the
[04:30.600 --> 04:34.920]  house Christian Science Monitor reports I haven't talked a lot about this but

[10:29.360 --> 10:36.320]  religious personal anything goes ladies and gentlemen any questions go that
[10:36.320 --> 10:42.520]  doesn't mean I'll be able to answer all of them but I'll I'll sure try 800 259
[10:42.520 --> 10:48.320]  92 31 while there is just so much crazy news going on that it's hard to know
[10:48.320 --> 10:59.240]  where to know where to start UK may approve creating babies with DNA from
[10:59.240 --> 11:03.680]  three people and the next will be the government telling you they have to
[11:03.680 --> 11:09.280]  approve the embryo making sure it doesn't have any disabilities that's in
[11:09.280 --> 11:12.960]  quotes and then that allows the genetic engineering how did I know all this was
[11:12.960 --> 11:22.000]  coming because the plan has been on record for a very very very long time so
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.680]  we're going to be getting to all of that coming up we're also going to continue
[11:29.680 --> 11:35.320]  breaking down the final border control battle in the House of Representatives
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.880]  Republicans are mocking the Senate bill and US workers that they're reporting
[11:40.880 --> 11:45.280]  are being passed over for foreigners we're going to be breaking all of that
[11:45.280 --> 11:49.560]  down a Christian Science Monitor says that it's cleared the Senate but faces
[11:49.560 --> 11:55.240]  roadblocks in the House we're going to be going over that as well and this first
[11:55.240 --> 12:03.960]  broke back on Monday and we covered it on Tuesday but we played a clip of it
[12:03.960 --> 12:13.440]  yesterday and it reminded me of what I've seen go on in England and other
[12:13.440 --> 12:16.640]  places where they've taken the guns from the general public and how the violent
[12:16.640 --> 12:21.440]  crime increases to record levels how the home invasions increase then you have
[12:21.440 --> 12:24.440]  places in the middle of Europe like Switzerland that has the lowest crime
[12:24.440 --> 12:29.560]  rate in the world because literally everyone is armed there aren't car
[12:29.560 --> 12:35.880]  jackings there aren't home invasions there aren't muggings except in a few
[12:35.880 --> 12:39.400]  housing project areas of a few of their biggest cities and that's mainly
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.640]  foreigners who have no history of owning firearms and aren't Swiss citizens so
[12:43.640 --> 12:48.480]  they don't have guns you can look at the numbers it is just such a fact and then
[12:48.480 --> 12:52.600]  you see the video in New Jersey in an area where it's almost impossible to
[12:52.600 --> 13:00.040]  own guns of the woman being beaten and thrown down the stairs and it goes on
[13:00.040 --> 13:05.520]  minute after minute while her children in catatonic fear are paralyzed in
[13:05.520 --> 13:11.520]  learned helplessness on the couch little children and that's what America is
[13:11.520 --> 13:18.760]  America is that little child and I'll be honest with you folks I am the gun you
[13:18.760 --> 13:26.680]  are the gun as adults you should take up the gun to protect yourself and your
[13:26.680 --> 13:33.800]  family so that a woman can defend herself against a man it was the Ku Klux
[13:33.800 --> 13:45.680]  Klan that first in this nation got laws passed in the south to disarm black
[13:45.680 --> 13:51.240]  people so that groups of whites could gang up racially on black people and
[13:51.240 --> 13:54.200]  beat them and shoot them and kill them now that's called racist and that's
[13:54.200 --> 13:59.440]  wrong but today if you look at the crime statistics in some areas it's 10 to 1
[13:59.440 --> 14:03.200]  but it's usually 5 to 1 black on white crime just adjust department own
[14:03.200 --> 14:07.600]  numbers you can look it up they don't want to publicize them in fact in some
[14:07.600 --> 14:13.480]  areas it's even higher that the media will not say or show the race when it is
[14:13.480 --> 14:17.720]  a black person attacking a white person because they they they want to
[14:17.720 --> 14:21.120]  continue to push racial division and have actually sold in many black
[14:21.120 --> 14:25.960]  communities that it's okay to attack white people because we're all bad and
[14:25.960 --> 14:30.000]  deserve it and then that brings in the whole Trayvon Martin Zimmerman case of
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.800]  where the witnesses are saying that sure we should have been falling down the
[14:33.800 --> 14:37.960]  street with a gun that's probably not a good idea but the fact is his nose was
[14:37.960 --> 14:41.760]  bloody his head had lacerations on the back of it he was reportedly on the
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.400]  ground having his head bounce like a basketball the question we should ask
[14:45.400 --> 14:48.040]  in this video we're going to play coming up a little bit later while I talk
[14:48.040 --> 14:57.520]  about this is should that woman be on trial for being attacked attacking that
[14:57.520 --> 15:03.440]  man's fist because she's white and that's racist and even worse if she'd
[15:03.440 --> 15:07.280]  had a gun in her own house had shot him would there be a new Trayvon Martin
[15:07.280 --> 15:14.040]  case that's a question that's a question and and I'm not even being
[15:14.040 --> 15:18.200]  sarcastic here because in England if you fight back against an attacker in your
[15:18.200 --> 15:30.240]  house they throw the book at you give an attacker falls through a skylight they
[15:30.240 --> 15:34.200]  sue and win against you if you're being raped and robbed and you stab someone
[15:34.200 --> 15:37.480]  in your own house they throw the book at you because the great crime in a
[15:37.480 --> 15:43.440]  tyranny is defending yourself because the predatory government does not want
[15:43.440 --> 15:46.960]  the slaves to be armed they want the monopoly of force and they want the
[15:46.960 --> 15:52.080]  client slave population to be like Jews in Nazi Germany and others to
[15:52.080 --> 15:57.560]  pliantly subserviently run into pits when the authority figure says so
[15:57.560 --> 16:01.640]  holding their hats while they're shot and then the next group bowels you know
[16:01.640 --> 16:06.720]  curtsies almost naked women with their newborn babies and toddlers on their
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.120]  hips the photos and film reels are out there to type in women in pits with
[16:11.120 --> 16:15.720]  children being shot by Nazis and I and I have nightmares about that folks as I've
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.960]  watched those black and white films growing up on PBS and and I'm gonna
[16:19.960 --> 16:23.200]  look it up myself and the Nazis themselves filmed it all over Eastern
[16:23.200 --> 16:29.080]  Europe all over Russia all over areas they take it over and then I see the
[16:29.080 --> 16:35.440]  footage of that woman not resisting and I see her child on the couch
[16:35.440 --> 16:40.640]  groveling in fear and I realize that's America is learned helplessness and I'm
[16:40.640 --> 16:43.960]  here to tell you ladies and gentlemen that I'm not going to sit here
[16:43.960 --> 16:49.480]  helplessly all the globalist assault us anymore and I'm not gonna sit here and
[16:49.480 --> 16:53.760]  just go down without a fight and that laying down and having mass Stockholm
[16:53.760 --> 16:58.880]  syndrome that's what it is is what is bringing this country into so much
[16:58.880 --> 17:03.800]  tyranny now it's the same from Australia to the United States from Canada to
[17:03.800 --> 17:09.000]  England to France when there's an emergency now they don't just block off
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.800]  the streets when there's a flutter of fire they come in and the police loot
[17:12.800 --> 17:20.360]  the houses rob the Walmart's rob the jewelry stores and rob the the the gas
[17:20.360 --> 17:24.040]  stations and things and you've seen it all over the world because we have a
[17:24.040 --> 17:28.320]  kleptocratic governments now that even the good cops they'll just stand down and
[17:28.320 --> 17:32.320]  go home and the bad cops rule the day because the bureaucracy is not going
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.880]  to prosecute them because that would be a PR disaster so the worst in any
[17:36.880 --> 17:41.800]  society or any office or any department it's not just the police I gotta be
[17:41.800 --> 17:44.960]  honest the police on average compared to a lot of the decadent sectors of the
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.800]  public in some areas have held it together better than general population
[17:48.800 --> 17:54.840]  this whole world is rotting ladies and gentlemen is absolutely rotting there's
[17:54.840 --> 17:58.760]  no doubt about that all the numbers the statistics are there and now we have this
[17:58.760 --> 18:06.600]  article out of the Calgary Herald held to pay residents angry at RC NPC's guns
[18:06.600 --> 18:12.480]  from High River Homes and we have a video we're going to go to after the
[18:12.480 --> 18:16.860]  break and then we're going to go to your phone calls but again we have this
[18:16.860 --> 18:24.360]  article up on info wars.com we've got Kurt Nemo writing an article about it and
[18:24.360 --> 18:27.440]  if you give me a document cam I could show people the article there it is
[18:27.440 --> 18:34.080]  held to pay residents angry as RCMP sees his guns from High River Homes it's
[18:34.080 --> 18:41.160]  just like Nazi Germany there's one of the articles and then here is another
[18:41.160 --> 18:45.080]  one of the headlines RCMP revealed Thursday that officers have seized a
[18:45.080 --> 18:49.840]  substantial amount of farms from homes in the evacuation town of High River we
[18:49.840 --> 18:53.600]  just want to make sure that all of those things are in a spot that we control
[18:53.600 --> 18:55.720]  it's not like there was looting or rioting and they went and got them
[18:55.720 --> 19:02.320]  simply because of what they are said Sergeant Brian Topham that news didn't
[19:02.320 --> 19:05.320]  sit well with a crowd of frustrated residents who plan to breach a police
[19:05.320 --> 19:09.880]  checkpoint northwest of the town as the evacuation order stretched into its
[19:09.880 --> 19:17.320]  eighth day so they locked down a area that had some flooding for eight days
[19:17.320 --> 19:20.000]  and you learn the police have just been digging through everybody's houses
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.340]  violating Magna Carta they have basically 4th Amendment up there as well but by
[19:24.340 --> 19:31.280]  practice and by precedent but possessions 910s the law every time I
[19:31.280 --> 19:37.640]  mean they locked down half of or more of Boston a town of 700,000 people and
[19:37.640 --> 19:42.560]  went and pointed guns everybody and shot up cars in LA that didn't even look
[19:42.560 --> 19:47.160]  like the same description or same supposed race you know during the
[19:47.160 --> 19:51.600]  Dorner hunt it's it's it's they're acting differently they're acting like mad

[26:07.360 --> 26:11.320]  government does in fact you could be breaking a law right now that you're
[26:11.320 --> 26:15.080]  not even aware of take a look at some of these laws that while they may be
[26:15.080 --> 26:20.400]  outdated and unenforced most of them are still on the books it's against the law

[26:25.320 --> 26:31.040]  in Boston well you better have a permit for that you whiskery wrongdoer in Iowa

[26:47.120 --> 26:50.960]  deformed to the point of being an unsightly or disgusting object from
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.360]  going out in public did you know that it is illegal to fart in public in Florida
[26:56.360 --> 27:04.280]  after 6 p.m. they're very serious about their clean air there in Indiana a bill
[27:04.280 --> 27:09.040]  was proposed to make law that the value of pie is 3 thankfully a mathematics
[27:09.040 --> 27:13.680]  professor was present in the legislature that day and the bill didn't pass in
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.440]  New Hampshire you may not tap your feet nod your head or in any way keep time
[27:18.440 --> 27:23.200]  with the music played in a tavern restaurant or cafe you ever heard of
[27:23.200 --> 27:28.320]  the computer fraud and abuse act well you've probably violated it have you
[27:28.320 --> 27:32.440]  ever has signed on to an unsecure Wi-Fi network what is it what does unsecure
[27:32.440 --> 27:36.240]  mean just like free you're sitting in your apartment and someone doesn't have
[27:36.240 --> 27:39.240]  their thing locked down so you're like oh I'm gonna go on the internet yes I
[27:39.240 --> 27:43.960]  have well that is a federal offense have you ever used a fake name when
[27:43.960 --> 27:49.800]  signing up for an internet account yeah yeah that's breaking law too also a
[27:49.800 --> 27:55.720]  felony okay okay okay so you did not mean to commit a federal crime of hacking
[27:55.720 --> 28:00.400]  when you logged on as see more buns but it just goes to show how easy it is to
[28:00.400 --> 28:05.200]  pass a law simply to control behavior that some people find offensive in fact
[28:05.200 --> 28:09.240]  you don't even have to break the law in order to get arrested for doing
[28:09.240 --> 28:14.400]  something others find disagreeable Jeff Olson is facing a 13-year jail
[28:14.400 --> 28:20.160]  sentence for writing anti-bank messages in water soluble chalk on the sidewalk
[28:20.160 --> 28:25.520]  and a 14-year-old would never be facing a year of jail time just for refusing to
[28:25.520 --> 28:30.320]  change his shirt if Obama hadn't waged an all-out war against the Second
[28:30.320 --> 28:35.000]  Amendment and don't even think about bomb water boarding snarky caricatures of

[28:40.440 --> 28:44.320]  you're doing today could seem harmless but a year from now it could be damaging
[28:44.320 --> 28:48.760]  just based on the whims of those in power and the police already abused the
[28:48.760 --> 28:53.200]  immense power that they have so if the NSA is recording every move that you
[28:53.200 --> 28:56.800]  make and somewhere along the line technically everyone is gonna break the
[28:56.800 --> 29:02.320]  law punishment becomes purely selective basically those in power will have
[29:02.320 --> 29:06.600]  whatever they need to punish whoever they like whenever they choose so the
[29:06.600 --> 29:10.680]  question shouldn't be I'm not doing anything wrong so why should I care if
[29:10.680 --> 29:16.080]  I'm being spied on the question is if I am not doing anything wrong then why the
[29:16.080 --> 29:20.960]  hell do you think you have the right to spy on me I'm Leanne McAdoo and this

[34:51.920 --> 34:59.800]  Nazi Germany just taking orders shouted another and it just goes on there to
[34:59.800 --> 35:05.560]  break down what's happening let's go to let's go to one of the local news clips
[35:05.560 --> 35:11.280]  here it is Thursday police revealed they have seized a significant number of
[35:11.280 --> 35:16.560]  firearms from evacuated homes we have seized a large quantity of firearms
[35:16.560 --> 35:22.080]  simply because they were left by residents in their in their places and
[35:22.080 --> 35:26.160]  they are now secure at the detachment that news didn't sit well with an
[35:26.160 --> 35:33.000]  already angry crowd the confrontation however didn't peacefully and again
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.760]  they've had some flooding there that's what's going on and now they're eight
[35:37.760 --> 35:41.560]  days into this and this is what government does now town's been dry for
[35:41.560 --> 35:47.480]  eight days the people are kept out of the town and in most experiences the
[35:47.480 --> 35:50.960]  police I don't know if these guys will be involved in that probably most of it
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.080]  won't be but in other cases around the world and here in the US they will go
[35:55.080 --> 35:58.720]  through everything most people will never get their guns back and we saw this
[35:58.720 --> 36:02.680]  during Katrina in the high and dry areas and we saw the police looting all over
[36:02.680 --> 36:07.920]  the place now shifting gears to a video that's gotten a lot of attention you're
[36:07.920 --> 36:12.440]  a radio listener you just search a New Jersey home invasion mother beaten in
[36:12.440 --> 36:18.240]  front of child and then you'll find the video that most of you have seen the
[36:18.240 --> 36:23.520]  video of the mother on the couch and a man comes in and just beats her and
[36:23.520 --> 36:28.240]  beats her and beats her and throws her down the stairs and stomps on her and
[36:28.240 --> 36:33.680]  it just goes on and on and on all caught on a nanny cam while it looks like a
[36:33.680 --> 36:37.880]  three-year-old a four-year-old child sits there in a catatonic state sucking
[36:37.880 --> 36:43.480]  her thumb which is normal for a child to do in many cases especially they haven't
[36:43.480 --> 36:47.000]  been trained to fight back or resist or hide especially what the child's doing
[36:47.000 --> 36:53.480]  is hiding in plain view but as a public we now have the public doing things like
[36:53.480 --> 36:58.880]  this and reportedly if you look at George Zimmerman who witnesses said was
[36:58.880 --> 37:04.600]  pummeled the nose and his head bashed into the ground that he was assaulted you
[37:04.600 --> 37:12.440]  know the only question is should this woman be arrested is is this is this a
[37:12.440 --> 37:18.800]  white on black crime I mean I want to be politically correct here okay in fact
[37:18.800 --> 37:21.800]  this woman could probably been black and they would just say she was white like
[37:21.800 --> 37:27.940]  George Zimmerman you know being of you mixed heritage and and again for me
[37:27.940 --> 37:33.320]  racism is nothing but a puppet shill operation to keep us fighting with each
[37:33.320 --> 37:37.820]  other but I just want to point out that you hardly ever see home invasion
[37:37.820 --> 37:43.480]  footage on the news and you hardly ever hear them talk about Hispanic on white
[37:43.480 --> 37:49.280]  or black on white crime in fact you don't hear about Hispanic on black crime
[37:49.280 --> 37:53.240]  that's really a big issue I just look at the statistics in Southern California
[37:53.240 --> 37:57.920]  because that doesn't fit into the race paradigm the only people that can be
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.640]  racial and go out and prey on someone is a white person the only people that
[38:02.640 --> 38:05.960]  can commit crimes are white people the only people that cheat on their taxes
[38:05.960 --> 38:10.080]  are white people the only people that don't wipe their hind ends properly are
[38:10.080 --> 38:16.840]  white people the only people that steal are white people I want to confess to
[38:16.840 --> 38:22.240]  this that I agree with MSNBC I don't like socialist government-run health care
[38:22.240 --> 38:24.760]  and the government having all my health records and sharing them whatever they
[38:24.760 --> 38:29.080]  want not because I'm into liberty because I'm a racist folks I want to keep
[38:29.080 --> 38:32.560]  my guns to be able to self-protect myself but I'm gonna make a confession it's
[38:32.560 --> 38:35.920]  because I'm really racist like Michael Moore says he says racist white people
[38:35.920 --> 38:40.200]  want their guns and and then they go on and you know they've had Fox News and
[38:40.200 --> 38:45.800]  Fox Sports guys say gun owners are the Klan you've seen that and I guess
[38:45.800 --> 38:50.160]  they're actually right in fact that woman and her child need to go to present
[38:50.160 --> 38:55.240]  or racism I'm being sarcastic of course ladies and gentlemen that ladies a poor
[38:55.240 --> 38:59.600]  victim in our heart you know it goes out to her it's just this stuff goes on and
[38:59.600 --> 39:04.680]  on and on okay I said I'd take calls and take your questions I'm going to do
[39:04.680 --> 39:10.720]  that now this is a Friday worldwide edition of the global transmission and
[39:10.720 --> 39:16.720]  we are mainly a radio show I'd say 95% of our audience millions and
[39:16.720 --> 39:21.440]  millions every day but we do have hundreds of thousands that watch the
[39:21.440 --> 39:28.960]  free streams at info wars dot com forward slash show free podcast free
[39:28.960 --> 39:34.560]  iPhone app free droid app all of it listed the free video stream right
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.400]  there at info wars dot com forward slash show and also we could not do this
[39:39.400 --> 39:43.000]  broadcast without you the listeners supporting and spreading word about the
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.600]  transmission we cannot do the broadcast without the best radio team that I've
[39:48.600 --> 39:53.280]  ever had and I've had great folks that have come through here in the past but
[39:53.280 --> 39:56.800]  let me tell you this crew is just learning and getting better and better
[39:56.800 --> 40:00.880]  and I'm learning and we're building a new media system in here and this is live
[40:00.880 --> 40:06.880]  this is teleprompter free and so I just want to say that our entire crew is
[40:06.880 --> 40:10.640]  really kicking butt in there and our sponsors and our AM and FM affiliates
[40:10.640 --> 40:16.760]  are really kicking butt out there as well and I want to just ask all of our
[40:16.760 --> 40:22.760]  listeners especially AM and FM listeners to to tell as many people as you can a
[40:22.760 --> 40:26.840]  day about the local affiliates that you're listening to us on whether it's
[40:26.840 --> 40:34.000]  in Austin Texas on 590 a.m. and 90.1 and 99.7 we're on three
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.360]  stations or whether it's Chicago on 1530 or all the other affiliates across
[40:40.360 --> 40:44.000]  the United States whether you're listening in Bakersville, California or
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.680]  Victorville, California or whether you're listening in New York City
[40:48.680 --> 40:54.480]  and Bloomberg bemoaned that we have multiple stations broadcasting into
[40:54.480 --> 40:59.320]  New York City they just cannot stand it they can't stand that we're on XM and a
[40:59.320 --> 41:01.680]  lot's been done to try to get us off of there and all their libertarian and
[41:01.680 --> 41:05.640]  conservative broadcast and big changes are coming next month I haven't seen
[41:05.640 --> 41:10.320]  about even talk about this but then I've also been contacted by other groups at
[41:10.320 --> 41:13.840]  XM that intend to try to continue to carry the show starting in July but it's
[41:13.840 --> 41:18.440]  not just gonna be my show that's scheduled it's most talk radio both
[41:18.440 --> 41:23.440]  libertarian and conservative talk in a shakeup at XM are to be taken off I
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.920]  can't believe nobody's talked about this shit because I quite frankly don't want
[41:26.920 --> 41:31.760]  to get in the middle of it and and and you know make some of the patriots at XM
[41:31.760 --> 41:35.800]  and Sirius just good people in every organization angry at me it's not
[41:35.800 --> 41:42.640]  pointed at info wars.com it is pointed at yeah there I'm on America's talk on
[41:42.640 --> 41:50.080]  XM there's a big shake up you know what I'm not even gonna get into it cuz I've
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.240]  got like vice presidents and people I've been supposed to call for two weeks at
[41:53.240 --> 41:57.920]  XM and have meetings and I just mean a time to mess with it and and and they're
[41:57.920 --> 42:00.640]  trying to figure out how to keep us on there because they know a lot of
[42:00.640 --> 42:04.400]  subscribers are there because of Genesis shows and what's being looked at is a
[42:04.400 --> 42:09.120]  whole channel for GCN and things like that but here's the deal I'm too busy on
[42:09.120 --> 42:12.960]  air I'm too busy doing news research I'm too busy paying the bills I'm too busy
[42:12.960 --> 42:17.320]  doing you know HR stuff around the office to again mess with the affiliate
[42:17.320 --> 42:22.400]  relations Genesis is doing that doing a great job my only point is is that
[42:22.400 --> 42:27.560]  there's a lot of people in the power structure you know Bloomberg basically
[42:27.560 --> 42:31.040]  you know saying why is he on XM he shouldn't be on there there's cover
[42:31.040 --> 42:36.080]  stories trying to shut down our free speech Michael Moore complained about a
[42:36.080 --> 42:43.800]  video exposing him as a redcoat and that video has been taken down I mean it's
[42:43.800 --> 42:48.120]  just there's hundreds of examples a month now of the dirty tricks and all the
[42:48.120 --> 42:53.040]  stuff we go through so you don't get to hear this show okay so the answer to
[42:53.040 --> 43:01.320]  their 1984 1776 the answer to their behavior is for us to take action that
[43:01.320 --> 43:06.920]  much more the answer to the fact that they don't want us on the air and they're
[43:06.920 --> 43:10.320]  doing everything they can to block us as for everybody to sponsor our local
[43:10.320 --> 43:13.960]  AM and FM affiliates and for everybody spread the word about the broadcast and
[43:13.960 --> 43:19.200]  for people to support the the show because it's growing but it's like we're
[43:19.200 --> 43:24.160]  going into the wind here we're moving forward but still if we didn't have so
[43:24.160 --> 43:28.720]  much resistance we would explode and we would really be able to turn the tide
[43:28.720 --> 43:33.040]  and we're doing it but not enough I mean I just burn to beat these people I
[43:33.040 --> 43:37.720]  burn to be able to reach people and warn them that hey you know the Gardasil
[43:37.720 --> 43:41.600]  vaccine doesn't protect you from most strains the papillona virus and causes
[43:41.600 --> 43:45.320]  autoimmune diseases on record in the studies and even has killed a bunch of
[43:45.320 --> 43:49.640]  people hey did you know the fluoride they put in the water isn't even calcium
[43:49.640 --> 43:54.160]  fluoride you that you need a little bit of it's deadly fluoride hey did you know
[43:54.160 --> 43:59.840]  I just want to warn people I just want the evil to stop I can't stand watching
[43:59.840 --> 44:02.640]  bad guys get away with stuff you've had somebody lie about you
[44:02.640 --> 44:06.640]  give it somebody make stuff up about you that's totally untrue and it really
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.680]  gets you angry I've gotten the point where I can handle that to myself
[44:10.680 --> 44:15.000]  personally and I've learned to just think of how sad those people must be and
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.960]  how pathetic but when I watch them abusing innocent people and when I watch
[44:19.960 --> 44:23.880]  organized crime in government and corporations getting away with bloody
[44:23.880 --> 44:29.640]  murder man I wanted to stop and I know you want to stop so let's just spread
[44:29.640 --> 44:36.720]  the word get info wars magazine give it to everybody you know the current July
[44:36.720 --> 44:40.480]  issue is on NSA spying what it's really behind it how it's a takeover of the
[44:40.480 --> 44:46.040]  internet a takeover of the real economy a control grid to be able to corner the
[44:46.040 --> 44:49.880]  stock market and other markets for insiders that have access hundreds of
[44:49.880 --> 44:52.640]  corporations well they said thousands but really it's hundreds for my intel
[44:52.640 --> 44:56.640]  that have actual access to everybody's info and huge computers to crunch it all
[44:56.640 --> 45:02.120]  this is a technotronic nightmare and it exposes it and there are 10 bumper
[45:02.120 --> 45:06.720]  stickers inside big petroleum base that's kind that lasts for years high
[45:06.720 --> 45:10.880]  quality bumper stickers even better than the last round of stickers buy them in
[45:10.880 --> 45:15.120]  bulk at cost info or store.com all right I'm done ranting about that it's just
[45:15.120 --> 45:18.360]  it's time to get really aggressive with the new world order I want to see them
[45:18.360 --> 45:24.720]  beat so bad that you everybody knows that we're really rivaling the system up
[45:24.720 --> 45:28.920]  they're attacking us every day in major publications we get death threats dirty
[45:28.920 --> 45:35.200]  tricks everything else and I'm just all in I mean I'm all into this fight
[45:35.200 --> 45:40.240]  kicking, jabbing, punching, biting, snapping, gouging eyes out politically I
[45:40.240 --> 45:46.160]  mean I am just in a skull hammering frenzy against the enemy and I want to
[45:46.160 --> 45:50.160]  see you be released against them and I want to overrun them and just have
[45:50.160 --> 45:56.280]  victory and restore the Republic. Let's go to Alex in Illinois what is your
[45:56.280 --> 46:02.280]  question today sir we're taking questions thank you for calling. Hey Alex this is
[46:02.280 --> 46:07.920]  Alex from Chirac and I called you three months ago on April 28th asking about
[46:07.920 --> 46:11.920]  the rabbit hole and though I disagree with your answer I had a follow-up
[46:11.920 --> 46:15.760]  question. Well how do you disagree with my answer I mean I said at the bottom of
[46:15.760 --> 46:20.120]  the rabbit hole was evil and corruption and people that are wicked and death I
[46:20.120 --> 46:23.520]  mean I mean what do you think is the bottom of the rabbit hole? I think it goes a
[46:23.520 --> 46:29.000]  little bit deeper beyond just existence stuff here on this plane but I want to
[46:29.000 --> 46:33.200]  follow up question of how far do you think America has sunk into the rabbit
[46:33.200 --> 46:38.080]  hole right meow? Well it's a paradox I mean people are kind of waking up
[46:38.080 --> 46:42.680]  because it's gotten so surreal but will they wake up all the way and put the
[46:42.680 --> 46:46.480]  brakes on this before they're being carted off to be you know shot in mass
[46:46.480 --> 46:51.960]  graves I mean will America you know lay there and take a beating will America go
[46:51.960 --> 46:55.560]  into a catatonic state of learned helplessness and Stockholm syndrome and
[46:55.560 --> 47:00.000]  so I think that is to be governed by those of us that are somewhat awake how
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.120]  energetic how aggressive will we get I mean I know I'm independent I know I
[47:04.120 --> 47:07.200]  started my own media operation that reaches 15 million people a week
[47:07.200 --> 47:13.240]  conservatively with my bootstraps and with other people that agreed with me
[47:13.240 --> 47:17.840]  and supported what I was doing so I know because I don't have some high view
[47:17.840 --> 47:21.840]  myself I know there are people out there listening right now that if they set on
[47:21.840 --> 47:26.680]  a mission to expose the globalist they will do it we will bring them down it is
[47:26.680 --> 47:33.600]  a will issue do we have unshakable unflagging total will the globalists
[47:33.600 --> 47:38.680]  have a strong will but they're scared now they can feel cracks in their arm in
[47:38.680 --> 47:42.680]  this arm wrestling contest I'm telling we can jerk their arm out of their bloody
[47:42.680 --> 47:47.400]  socket like Beowulf to Grendel if we just decide to do it I mean I'm telling
[47:47.400 --> 47:51.960]  you they can feel their arms starting to tear out right now okay and I'm telling
[47:51.960 --> 47:55.320]  you we just keep ripping it's gonna come out you got to decide to rip their
[47:55.320 --> 47:59.520]  arm out of their socket politically you got to decide with the moral authority
[47:59.520 --> 48:02.960]  to get back in their face that's why they're so over the top right now they
[48:02.960 --> 48:06.720]  are scared to death because when we take this country back they're all going to
[48:06.720 --> 48:12.080]  prison God bless you Alex we're Rod in France go ahead you're on the air
[48:12.080 --> 48:18.080]  Bonjour Alex Montfaire and I hope you're doing well you're a little bit out of
[48:18.080 --> 48:23.840]  control there today we might have to get you on some psychotropic drugs and and
[48:23.840 --> 48:28.160]  get you to start drinking drinking some water with some hydrofluoresic acid I
[48:28.160 --> 48:33.040]  think yeah I need to get into a trance stage feel all good about everything and
[48:33.040 --> 48:36.800]  not pay attention to the rising waters of tyranny around me what's your question
[48:36.800 --> 48:43.640]  brother yeah okay well I I've got some stuff on things that I think people
[48:43.640 --> 48:47.120]  should know about and I don't have the answer to him and I thought maybe you
[48:47.120 --> 48:51.080]  could help me it's kind of a state versus federal laws as far as the
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.480]  National National Guard goes you know the National Guard is supposed to be
[48:56.480 --> 49:00.280]  protecting the state is that and is under the control of the government if
[49:00.280 --> 49:09.920]  if you know if there was an all-out you know huge crisis nationally and I guess
[49:09.920 --> 49:14.400]  the federal government can call on the National Guard but if the state wants to
[49:14.400 --> 49:19.640]  use the National Guard for its own protection at the same time who has the
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.560]  supreme authority over that's right if the federal government won't do its job
[49:23.560 --> 49:27.520]  it is the job in the Constitution for the states to put troops on the border it
[49:27.520 --> 49:31.560]  is the job of the states to protect themselves and they're trying to
[49:31.560 --> 49:35.280]  federalize the guard it used to be totally a state group now they quasi
[49:35.280 --> 49:39.400]  federalized it now they're totally federalizing it and that's part of the
[49:39.400 --> 49:43.920]  state nullification process but to really nullify the federal government we
[49:43.920 --> 49:46.560]  have to point out it's not even a question of the federal government it is
[49:46.560 --> 49:50.600]  now a globalist government at the executive and bureaucratic level under
[49:50.600 --> 49:55.760]  UNESCO I mean here's an example out of Canada Calgary floods spotlight cities
[49:55.760 --> 50:00.760]  costly failure to plan for climate change it's been proven that change is
[50:00.760 --> 50:04.840]  the only constant it's been proven there's always bad weather in different
[50:04.840 --> 50:08.520]  parts of the world but they say anytime there's a flood that it's because we're
[50:08.520 --> 50:13.520]  using carbon dioxide that they want to tax meanwhile they're engaged in giant
[50:13.520 --> 50:18.280]  geoengineering programs but won't say what that's about and then I point out

[54:15.920 --> 54:20.480]  piece yesterday that I saw this morning where they were claiming that I'm
[54:20.480 --> 54:24.400]  basically homophobic to use their their term where they set all the
[54:24.400 --> 54:29.240]  parameters no I said I turn on television and they're attacking biological
[54:29.240 --> 54:33.120]  families the nuclear family everybody knows that's all over TV everybody
[54:33.120 --> 54:37.840]  knows that there's a demonization by Hollywood and an attempt to sexualize
[54:37.840 --> 54:43.960]  children both heterosexually and homosexual and the political correctness
[54:43.960 --> 54:47.080]  says don't even work use the word homosexual it's like saying don't use
[54:47.080 --> 54:51.160]  the word the caucus mountains so cockazoids or white people I mean it's
[54:51.160 --> 54:56.200]  just you know I guess if I call you know a bird by its scientific name it's
[54:56.200 --> 55:01.840]  racist anything ignorant masses of people don't know now is racist basically
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.000]  or or or bigoted and the article says there's no evidence that estrogen
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.520]  mimickers are hurting anybody so I've got pharmacist Ben Fuchs coming on and
[55:11.520 --> 55:16.240]  I'll show you about 10 mainstream and alternative news articles and studies
[55:16.240 --> 55:22.120]  with with estrogen mimickers just causing mass death I mean that's a well
[55:22.120 --> 55:26.160]  known fact and thank God we've gotten target in other places to bring in
[55:26.160 --> 55:31.560]  plastics that don't have it and cookware that isn't lined with it and and again
[55:31.560 --> 55:35.480]  they're so mad I'm talking about this they go that guy hates gay people hey
[55:35.480 --> 55:38.520]  man if you think breast I mean I mean next I hate women because I don't want
[55:38.520 --> 55:44.520]  to get breast cancer the article actually says that there's no evidence that
[55:44.520 --> 55:48.120]  estrogen mimickers are hurting anybody well at least you admit they're in the
[55:48.120 --> 55:52.160]  food and stuff at least I gotta do that I mean this is incredible and the truth
[55:52.160 --> 55:55.640]  is it's the White House science are you wrote about it Nico science they're
[55:55.640 --> 55:59.320]  putting additives and everything to mess with us it's brave new world it's on
[55:59.320 --> 56:03.760]  record I mean next to my anti-gay because I don't want people to get
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.240]  brain cancer from sodium fluoride I mean what does that have to do with it
[56:07.240 --> 56:11.520]  what does that but this is what they do so I'm going to your phone calls and then
[56:11.520 --> 56:16.120]  X Chicago cop Zimmerman acquittal to cause race riots I saw this article this
[56:16.120 --> 56:20.440]  morning by Paul Watson and thought it was important and there are a lot of
[56:20.440 --> 56:23.280]  people saying on Twitter and Facebook everywhere that they're planning to riot
[56:23.280 --> 56:30.920]  and kill whites and I mean I guess that's probably a good idea I mean whites
[56:30.920 --> 56:34.920]  are bad so I don't want to be politically incorrect so all whites should
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.480]  report to giant woodchippers at sports stadiums to be fed in to prove you're
[56:39.480 --> 56:44.120]  not racist I mean I'm just so sick of this ladies and gentlemen I mean are
[56:44.120 --> 56:49.280]  white people gonna riot cuz a black guy's on tape beating a white woman I
[56:49.280 --> 56:56.240]  bet he to beat anybody he was coming there to beat up but I mean I'm gonna
[56:56.240 --> 56:59.120]  tell you you know most women I know regardless what color they were would
[56:59.120 --> 57:04.280]  have fought back just pretty amazing pretty amazing to see that footage we're
[57:04.280 --> 57:08.360]  calling it you know more proof that Obama's gun control is working because
[57:08.360 --> 57:11.280]  they've taken all the guns basically in New Jersey and so we're gonna be
[57:11.280 --> 57:13.840]  breaking that down let's jam in one question right now I'm gonna come back
[57:13.840 --> 57:17.240]  take more calls and get to our guest Mitch in California what's your
[57:17.240 --> 57:22.040]  question sir hey how's it going Alex well I'm just realizing how bad it is
[57:22.040 --> 57:28.480]  that I'm a white person so I had a question for you you've always said
[57:28.480 --> 57:34.480]  that like on record it's been for years and years all these all these plans and
[57:34.480 --> 57:39.200]  a lot of times I've been awake for years but a lot of times when I try and awake
[57:39.200 --> 57:42.680]  people I'll show them your show and it's just it's too much for them they're
[57:42.680 --> 57:47.120]  not down drop it whole enough I guess to to really understand what you're
[57:47.120 --> 57:51.240]  talking about and I'm wondering if there's any articles that you have or
[57:51.240 --> 57:56.800]  any books kind of like a conspiracy 101 I don't think I would yeah I think the
[57:56.800 --> 58:03.120]  Obama deception or a film like in-game those those are I mean that they're
[58:03.120 --> 58:06.240]  hardcore they're they're very hard to believe but they have online bibliographies
[58:06.240 --> 58:12.160]  like what is the in-game comm so they can document it but I found you couldn't
[58:12.160 --> 58:16.960]  wake the sheeple up to why is it bad for police during a flood to go door to door
[58:16.960 --> 58:20.600]  and confiscate guns you know maybe they can understand hey why didn't they do it
[58:20.600 --> 58:26.280]  before because all you do is set up checkpoints and stop looting you don't go
[58:26.280 --> 58:31.240]  into people's houses and then you rob them so someone else doesn't rob them see
[58:31.240 --> 58:35.680]  logic is an enemy we're never gonna get the general sheeple they're gonna go off
[58:35.680 --> 58:38.880]  and die of fluoride poisoning we're reaching out to those that can understand
[58:38.880 --> 58:41.240]  this
[58:42.520 --> 58:50.320]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:50.720 --> 58:55.280]  Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives nature
[58:55.280 --> 59:00.160]  regularity census destructive storms 24 hours before a storm strikes people
[59:00.160 --> 59:04.920]  panic it would be wise to prepare a head of the panic curve the food price
[59:04.920 --> 59:09.240]  stormed from drought and livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous
[59:09.240 --> 59:12.800]  heights by the end of the summer wonder if there'll really be a problem he

[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.840]  mimicers in the food and water are not bad for you of course they don't cite
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:37.480]  any scientific studies we will be doing that because I want people to know what's
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:43.480]  being done to them by design in fact I'm gonna do a special in Obama deception to
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:48.320]  just on the eugenics and their own admissions of how they're adding things
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.080]  the food and water to create asexuals actually when they're done people won't
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.960]  even have a sexuality they'll just be biological androids so that's coming up
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:01.680]  but first they have to break up the family in their own words Tony in

[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.440]  calls people been volunteering what their question is it says Rand Paul up
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.120]  there no that's a mistake okay okay well go ahead and ask your question yeah
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.120]  I'll take the answer out there I've been a long-time supporter of architects and
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.720]  engineers for 9-11 truth and in 2011 I came across the work of an engineer with
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:38.080]  Evans to the contrary I assumed at first glance that she was either a cook or
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.800]  coming to Elpro wait a minute wait a minute John Harman just came on and
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.680]  said you said you wanted to talk about Rand Paul sir we're not screening your
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.280]  calls you didn't have to give us a fake story to get on and then come on and say
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.680]  I'm wrong did you or did you not tell him that you wanted to talk about Rand
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:04.280]  Paul yeah I didn't say you're wrong I said it was a mistake I figured I'd get
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.000]  the phone hung up on me I was just calling to recommend an interview with
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.800]  sir hold on hold on just a minute hold on a minute sir we don't screen calls
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.200]  unless I say I want people to call in who are in this town that's on fire or
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.720]  something or there's a mass shooting on a university you know will you call us
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.640]  that's the only time do you not believe me that that that we don't screen
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.040]  people's phone calls no sir and I'll respect that and no I don't care it
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.960]  just sounds weird I mean you know it says okay Rand Paul if you volunteer it
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.400]  I'll bring it up now now start over with what you wanted to say go ahead yeah
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.320]  I'll make it quick and I'll take the answer off here thanks for your time oh
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.800]  thank you I was a supportive architects engineers and I live in truth for a
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.480]  long time and came across came across the work of Dr. Judy Wood in her book
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.600]  where did the towers go first by hearing just does he venture on your show like
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:02.520]  2011 mentioned her name her work is astounding and the evidence shows that
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.520]  thermal and kinetic means were not employed in the destruction of the
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.000]  World Trade Center complex record scale data is enough itself it shows that the
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.320]  there were no sure so what's your question if you have her on and regardless
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.840]  of your where you stand if you'd have her on and have yourself sure sure sure
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.600]  let me answer that question and I appreciate your call I am the founder
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.600]  of questioning 9-11 I mean there was no red stand down the hijackers were trained
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.720]  at US bases that's Sacramento be associated press that means I question
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.680]  there needs to be a real investigation you know Bush and Cheney weren't under
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.320]  oath blah blah blah they then turn that into Alex says like Wiley code Bush blew
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.200]  up the towers so then again they misrepresent I say hey they've got
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.400]  weather weapons it's on history channel that turns into I say Obama sent a
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:57.520]  tornado so they build strong men around what I've really said about 9-11 I want
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.840]  to go with hey they said they blew up building seven we have scores of
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.000]  newscast saying they blew it up then they say don't say that it's a conspiracy
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.360]  theory when I have BBC CNN you name it saying so I wanted to stick with that
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.680]  people can debate and argue all day a 9-11 truth what they think happened not
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.200]  Judy Wood and I've let Ventura come on and promote her I mean that's fine I
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.880]  didn't say anything when he brought it up I don't know her I know some of the
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.400]  people associated with her got really vicious towards Steven Jones professor
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:32.240]  and other people and then I got attacked by people saying I was covering up what
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.280]  happened and I better have people on so when I'm approached like that I
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:41.240]  immediately just go wow this is like a weird academic fight like different
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.800]  schools of Darwinism or something fighting with each other I've just stayed
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:51.120]  out of it okay and that's basically the end of it and then I'm attacked
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.040]  everywhere for just sticking to what I think is the most important evidence of
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.840]  prior knowledge and involvement there's your answer

[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.800]  much pharmacist been fuchs knows I want to get him on a host of stories have been
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.160]  coming out in some other news that he's been working on he joins us about once

[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:35.680]  chad eric gabriel and sergeant bill for folks that are patiently holding I'm
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.800]  taking questions today a lot of shows do that I never seem to do it people like
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.000]  to hear questions from the listeners kind of the wild card different things
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.520]  they bring up so we're going to be doing that and then Gerald Salente is going to
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:53.840]  be in studio with us now this story just broke in Canada yesterday it has not
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:59.440]  been in the US press it is now Canadian Mounties exploit flood to confiscate
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:06.320]  firearms from citizens they've gone into even dry homes in a large area eight
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.800]  days in the floods gone and are confiscating the gun is just like
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:15.360]  Katrina so citizens complain cop-seizing guns is something right out of Nazi
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:22.040]  Germany and that is the quote that article is up on info wars dot com right
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:27.800]  now also continuing the government trying to exacerbate racial division the
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:32.200]  Justice Department directly in there organizing groups on record when they
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.560]  got caught they pulled out of it to protest the death of Trayvon Martin I
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.560]  don't think what Zimmerman did was smart following somebody down the sidewalk
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.720]  who they see they think acting suspiciously it's not suspicious to be
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:51.560]  wearing a hoodie it's not suspicious to be black I think that there are
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:55.840]  stereotypes and things that go on where I have seen and grew up in Dallas and
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.200]  have a lot of black friends but especially in Dallas growing up where you
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.440]  be with one of your black friends want to play basketball or baseball and a cop
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.920]  would pull over just because you're walking down the street even if you were
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.120]  clean-cut and then if I was a white kid with other white kids I never really had
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.360]  cops pull over and ask us where we were going so I've experienced walking with
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.240]  a black person kind of like walking while black I get this kind of stuff goes
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:23.120]  on but then when you see Hollywood and MTV with the image of gangster gangster
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:28.000]  and people embracing that and crime statistics because of what's been sold
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.520]  because this wasn't this way you can actually look up FBI numbers from like
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:38.400]  the 30s and stuff was actually lower illegitimacy and lower crime rates in
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.280]  most black areas than in white areas like I need to do a whole special on this
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:47.200]  sometimes I really know statistics in history that's what's so weird how do
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.920]  black areas now have the highest crime in the United States how do you have in
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.080]  many areas 10 to 1 black on white crime I look up just apartment numbers you
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.120]  just type in 10 to 1 black on white crime so then it becomes a self-fulfilling
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:06.360]  prophecy and it shows really the job government's done in just 60 years of
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.640]  kicking men out of the house and saying women are in charge kick your man out you
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.640]  get all this money and undermining the male authority figure and look if you
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:21.360]  follow the black collapse which is on record 90 plus percent illegitimacy crime
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:27.200]  rates off the charts the system set up to funnel blacks into jail and prison to
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.580]  then get their their training as criminals if you look at the statistics
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:36.360]  whites Hispanics are following the same trail just haven't been on it as long
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:42.800]  and are now shooting up in crime illegitimacy life expectancy going down
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:46.640]  the black male has the lowest life expectancy of any racial group in this
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:53.000]  country and and it this is what government and fake feminism has done by
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.360]  design and so I intend in fact in Obama deception to we're making it right now
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.560]  the problem is I got so much evidence so much info it'll at least be one of the
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.880]  extras I want to show these crime statistics less illegitimacy in the
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:11.600]  black community than in the white community 67 years ago less crime in
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:17.080]  most areas let's see they made the black neighborhoods the authorized crime
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:21.520]  zones it's in the godfather which is based on true story where they say we
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.200]  keep the drugs in the colored area they are animals let them lose their souls
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.840]  that was the attitude that's where they did the medical testing all of it and
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.240]  so there is a victimization there but now it's been turned into something else
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.440]  and you're not supposed to talk about it you're not supposed to talk about
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.160]  groups of black kids you know out beating up whites and attacking all over
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:47.000]  the country in gangs in racial gangs just like the Klan did when it was seen as
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.320]  culturally acceptable to go out and attack and kill blacks humans it's the
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:56.600]  same wiring same stuff folks different pigmentation of the skin all I mean that
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:01.480]  you can say on average there might be genetic variations in groups you know
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.960]  from one part of the world the other or this or that but when you get down to it
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:12.520]  people are people and it people will dehumanize a group so that they can
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.360]  then abuse them like oh the the the Native Americans are savages so we can
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:21.440]  kill them or you know the Jews are all criminals so we can kill them or well
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:25.960]  whites are the problem so we can go rob them and I saw famous cases a few years
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.680]  ago guys trying to pull that up and forget the guy's name one of the main
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:33.680]  black radical leaders on Houston shed stop mugging black people go mug some
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:40.320]  whites you know so so but it's a manifestation but you see then there's
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:47.360]  no autoimmune system against racism if it's coming from someone who is not
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:54.240]  white because people they call it reverse racism what an oxymoronic term
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:00.840]  what an oxymoronic term to call it reverse racism as if only whites could
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.200]  be engaged in racism when whites are like seven percent of the world
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.760]  population and dropping fast so I guess as soon as there's no supposed white
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.760]  people even though their genetics will go on it's just like you know if you made
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.080]  it a German shepherd with a pit bull or whatever you know one comes from northern
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.400]  Europe and one they think comes from probably you know southern Europe I mean
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.280]  it doesn't matter it's still a wolf it's just that's kind of like you know like a
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:31.080]  French bulldog is still a dog and can mate with a Chihuahua I mean you can say
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:35.680]  there's differences in whatever happened in breeding culture wars all of it the
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.760]  point is they people are obsessed with this because this is what humans did
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:43.200]  look you'd have a tribe and your tribe would produce more than the other tribe
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.320]  and then you'd make an excuse of some you know well the tribe beat up one of
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:49.240]  our people or killed somebody down by the waterhole so we're gonna get together
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:54.800]  and go kill them and take their women I don't care if you're black white Asian
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.600]  whatever you suppose a group you come from your ancestors tended to be the
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:07.520]  people that like to breed like to kick butt like to stomp people's heads in but
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.080]  also new science and how to produce things and make weapons and and produce
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.520]  food and so we are aggressive and I mean my ancestors I've we've gone back to the
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.000]  lineage on both sides it's like everything from famous preachers to
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.800]  pirates to you name it I mean there's a reason I'm so crazed and my family
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:29.720]  always just going back into the midst of Europe has been on the front line of
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.440]  generally Liberty revolutions and a fighting overwhelming odds but
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:42.480]  everybody has that that genetic code but is it a pre is it something that's
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.760]  that's that's dominant in you that's really a question I mean they know
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.720]  psychopath behavior is most of its genetic can you get a psychopath early
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:58.760]  out of it with with nurture it depends in the studies they've done they're
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:02.800]  artificially kind of creating sociopaths in the culture that will carry out
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.760]  psychopathic type behaviors we're gonna go to break come back with pharmacist
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.840]  Ben Fuchs it's just that I wanted to discuss this and talk about it because
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:16.360]  no one wants to live in harmony and and and freedom and a future together like
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:22.960]  me and you know I get up here and say hey they're they're in the vaccines
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.800]  giving people viral plagues here's the evidence in Africa let's stop the
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:35.480]  depopulation program in Africa let's stop Obama doubling the money for basically
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.520]  forced abortions in Africa and and and in China as well our government helps
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.680]  fund that through the World Health Organization on record look it up just
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.880]  type in Obama increases you know abortion funding in Africa and it turns
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:49.240]  out they coerce the women and you're and then liberal go well there are too many
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.840]  people there I'm like so you want to kill black babies but I'm a racist because I
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:56.120]  don't want government-run health care I want to own a gun to protect myself and
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.880]  I'm a racist but they're like well yeah there are too many black people and
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.680]  that's the average liberal white person it folks everything is scrambled that's
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:06.360]  what's so frustrating like I don't like the forced sterilization going on in
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:11.880]  Mexico of poor people right now because it's a tyranny and it'll and but the
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.200]  argument is well you don't like a hundred plus million people with 30
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:18.360]  million new people every five years I mean I thought you don't want all these
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.800]  poor people drive down wages no I want to bring out the free energy systems and
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.600]  build it up and empower people and once they become industrialized they'll only
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.560]  have two kids or less like we do in the West you see I mean I really want to be
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.000]  able to go to Mexico and have it be big shining beautiful buildings and high
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.040]  tech and jet copters and happy people yeah I don't want them dead I don't want
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:43.560]  to sterilize Mexican women and but it matters the LaRica and quista groups are
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.080]  so into their race thing they're like we're taking over we're getting your
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:50.800]  guns gringo we'll show you and I'm going you're going to show me I don't want
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:56.560]  your people to die and but they're not programmed to hear that on average that
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:02.840]  great truth of I'm saying don't abort the Hispanic babies I mean I come at
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.400]  things from just pure justice what I want that done to me do on to others as
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.600]  you'd have done under you I mean that that to me isn't even a rule that is what
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:18.040]  I live I mean I know from all their tomes and articles and time life magazine

[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:48.000]  and then they write articles about how I hate gay people and then they're like

[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:55.320]  today and I want to get into a host of medical news that's breaking but first
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:02.160]  off I wanted to show you an article out of a salon.com and it says Alex Jones
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:05.640]  gay marriage truther the conspiracy theorist said the government is
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:09.360]  turning people gay through chemical warfare and what they do is they take
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:14.280]  out of context that I simply said women are going into puberty now on average at
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:18.600]  10 instead of 14 some of them in age 3 women are having girls are having babies
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.880]  at age 7 or 8 all over the Western world because of the estrogen mimicry is in
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.160]  the plastic I'm gonna show a bunch of articles this is on record that's why
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.000]  they're actually pulling them out of a lot of things it's a testament to a
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.880]  wake-up and a big victory but the third world they're actually not stopping and
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:37.760]  they're having even bigger problems as well and they said here you know that I
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:44.000]  said that lining and potato chip and juice boxes and things like that I said
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.600]  bisphenol a but they just act like I'm ignorant is is hyper feminizing women
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:53.240]  and then feminizing men men go into puberty later smaller genitals on
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:57.040]  average lower sperm counts it's all on record we're gonna go over those
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.280]  documents and articles for the people out there that say this isn't true all of
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.360]  this is going on it's killing women it's directly linked I had a breast cancer
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.840]  survivor in here lady that went to the Supreme Court and you know won that gene
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:12.160]  patenting case and she said absolutely she knows all the names of it she says
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.720]  yeah it's the estrogen mimicers are one of the biggest reason this is
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:22.720]  happening and they just say in here with no link this rider says that that yes
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:28.120]  there are estrogen mimicers that leech out of the bags but there's no evidence
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.640]  that they're harmful to one's health or the government is involved in secret
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.960]  plot to turn the country gay really here's BBC US military pondered love
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.960]  not war to spray chemicals on enemy armies the chemicals they found in test
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:45.920]  would basically make men be attracted to men it's pheromone manipulation it's why
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:49.760]  a man is attracted to a woman you add chemicals you can make a man think man
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:55.520]  why do you want it I mean that that's a that's BBC and I got hundreds of these
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:00.000]  articles but then it's not about the gay they want to make it I don't I don't get
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.360]  into those issues I mean sure goes back thousands of years that stuff's happened
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:08.040]  before naturally the point is is that they're the side effects is that it's
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:13.760]  causing sexual confusion asexuality and is feminizing men that's undebatable and
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.440]  and you're the pharmacist the expert we're going to break but what do you make
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.800]  of salon just as we go out to break in the next two minutes saying there's no
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.320]  evidence when I'm going to show people hundreds of articles well you got to do
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.720]  Alex and thank you so much for the introduction all you got to do Alex is
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:31.520]  just do your own research go to PubMed.com go to ScholarGoogle.com
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:37.560]  Google BPA Benzphenol-A and gender bender Google BPA and breast cancer Google BPA
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:43.000]  and infertility Google BPA and sexual dysfunction do your own research it is
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.440]  voluminous thousands literally thousands of studies show that Benzphenol-A and
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:54.640]  estrogen mimickers what are so-called Zenoestrogens have horrible
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:01.240]  effects most especially on sexuality and fertility but I mean how can they
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:04.080]  attack me all over the news not just here they're really scared of us
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.400]  focusing on this yes they're scared exactly there's haters everywhere Alex
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.960]  but we love you I wouldn't pay any attention that nonsense but you're
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.880]  right you know in the tall poppy syndrome you ever hear the tall poppy
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.240]  syndrome they cut off the tall poppy in Australia they say don't grow too high

[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.280]  you guys as well my point is is that they're demonizing this when they know

[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.320]  continue to attack me on this when I'm trying to stop breast cancer it's a
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.760]  particular cancer they go and fish out this one comment which is really cold
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.560]  blooded don't they want to warn people no they don't the mainstream media is not

[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:57.200]  senators vote to create incentive for employers to hire immigrants over US
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:03.200]  citizens the amnesty immigrants and I actually saw this on Monday and barely
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.120]  mentioned it and I should have made a bigger deal about it I saw another
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:11.600]  article this is out in the news today by John McCormick that that section got
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:17.320]  brought up by senator sessions and I went and read the subsection and it
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:23.680]  actually says that the legalized illegal aliens that are here illegally they
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:31.080]  you can hire them what is it for up to three years
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:43.880]  and and that for a total of 13 years this will go on I can't even believe this
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:50.200]  why I see things like this it's just like big business see I'm actually
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.920]  speechless right now so much just hits me whenever I look at an article all the
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:00.680]  data that it's impossible to tell you how bad it is the insurance companies
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:06.800]  wrote Obamacare on record I just got chills of anger they wrote Obamacare so
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.440]  they could take away good treatments and so the government could tell you what
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.520]  treatments you can get and it makes you buy the health care and doubles the
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:18.280]  premiums already in the first year on record and it's written to basically
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:29.440]  bankrupt our health care system and it's the same thing with this bill if you cut
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:36.760]  your employees back to below 30 hours then you don't have to get to health
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:40.040]  care and most businesses are gonna be forced to do this because they can't
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:44.000]  afford it we're spending right now more money than we're bringing in because I'm
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.320]  trying to expand and fight the globalist and under this we're still trying to
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.640]  figure out with lawyers and how it's gonna be implemented nobody knows it's
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:54.920]  causing certainty all over the country that I'm gonna have to let go a bunch
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:59.400]  of people if it goes in the way the White House says it's like or I could cut
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:05.920]  them back to below 30 hours and and pay them a lower wage it's just and then I
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:09.400]  got to hear how it's great and I'm a racist if I'm not for it like what does
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:13.600]  it have to do with it let's just tell the dumb public he's racist he doesn't
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.760]  want to fire you he's racist like what does it have to do with it everything is
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:24.640]  so dumbed down I'm going back to Ben Fuchs I was reading this oh under
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:28.760]  Obamacare businesses with over 50 workers that employ American citizens
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:32.440]  without offering them qualifying health insurance could be subject to fines of
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:37.000]  up to 3,000 per worker but because newly legalized immigrants would be
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.920]  eligible for subsidies on Obamacare exchanges until they become citizens
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:46.600]  at least 13 years under the Senate bill three under a house version I'd seen
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:50.920]  businesses could avoid such fines by hiring new immigrants instead I mean
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.280]  this is all for big corporations that know how to do this little companies
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.760]  like mine they're actually trying to you know fight for liberty or restaurants
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.000]  or whatever they don't even know how to do it plus they don't even let you I
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.240]  just and then I'm reading how this expands it and how the two bills go
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:10.760]  together this has all been planned to ruin everybody don't not explain this to
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:16.600]  people and it's all unfair because Americans put up with everything when
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:22.160]  the government sees in America and they see a chump when the wind sailors 200
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.720]  years ago saw a right whale that were sweet and playful to come over and bump
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.640]  the boat and bring their babies up the whalers would be like thank you baby and
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:35.800]  that's us it's like oh here's my baby shoot a harpoon into it that I mean we
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:43.480]  are the galactic chump azoids chump azoids that's a new word I just invented
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:55.200]  schmuck azoids dupe azoids suck azoids twerp azoids idiot azoids failure
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.840]  azoids sickly I'm gonna shut up he's on as a guest I got Joltz something coming
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:03.400]  up I'm gonna give you the floor and as you talk I'm gonna show mainstream news
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:07.600]  article after mainstream news article it makes me angry that they've had MSNBC
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:11.360]  White House Run Media Matters and now Salon come out and say there's no
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.280]  danger and estrogen mimicers in your water when it's all on record giving us
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.720]  cancer I want you to break this down I'm gonna show literally it's got to be 50
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:24.560]  mainstream news articles and studies to people watching on TV and then and then
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.920]  radio listeners as you said can just Google what do they search engine
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:34.000]  dupe up PubMed.com and you get government studies but if you do scholar.google.com
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.480]  you get scientific studies without the advertising that should be on
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:42.360]  everybody's desktop that should be bookmarked by everybody scholar.google.com
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:47.000]  PubMed.com is okay as well I go to scholar.google.com for almost everything
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.680]  all my research as well as going to the library and that's really the most
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.680]  important thing Alex is we got to do our own research we cannot get our
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:59.960]  information from government sponsored media MSNBC is not our friends Fox News
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:05.920]  is not our friends the government the mass media is not our friends we have to
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.080]  do our own research when it comes to these these roundups and estrogen
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:15.680]  mimicers and glyphosates that we're talking about they are hideous
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.680]  beyond belief you know when it comes to roundup and it comes to these glyphosates
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:24.240]  do you know Alex you can't even wash the stuff off of your vegetables it's in
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.760]  the soil and it's in the water so that as the plant is growing it's
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:33.360]  incorporated into the plant and why is that a problem oh little things like
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:40.440]  infertility breast cancer seizures brain fog feeling crappy the fact of the
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:46.960]  matter is we are biochemical beings we are biochemical beings at the physical
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.520]  level and we play around we tweak with our biochemistry at our own peril the
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:56.040]  fact that our own government our own government is sponsoring this kind of
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:01.800]  poisoning of its people is hideous and scary and evil beyond belief so what do
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.080]  you do about it well we all have to eat vegetables we all got to eat fruits and
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:11.400]  that's really the the sneakiest thing of the whole of the whole scandal is for
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.440]  folks who are eating fast foods folks who are eating McDonald's and French
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.800]  fries and snack foods that's one thing okay they're they're playing with fire
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.360]  they know that they they're gonna have a price to pay for doing that but what
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.640]  about folks who are eating vegetables what about folks who are practicing good
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:28.880]  nutrition now they have to deal with poisons that are built in that are
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:33.000]  embedded into the into the fruits and the vegetables themselves or what do you
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.120]  do well first of all you got to eat vegetables right so how do you handle
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:41.960]  this the most important thing you could do Alex in my opinion is make sure you
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:47.760]  are reducing the toxic load on your body wherever possible and job number one if
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.000]  you are on a prescription drug and I'm telling you this as a pharmacist as
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.920]  somebody who's been studying medicine now for going on 30 years if you are on a
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:59.600]  prescription drug you are putting a burden on your body's detoxification
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.120]  system you are putting a burden on your liver that will then make it much more
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.960]  difficult for your body to process these estrogen mimicers these gender benders
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:12.280]  these roundups and pesticides not to mention all the stuff that's being
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.760]  spewed out in the air and stuff that's put into our water like fluoride second
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:22.080]  thing you could do is make sure you're using nutritional supplementation
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.280]  especially supplements that protect your liver especially supplements that
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:31.200]  help up regulate the detoxification enzymes in your body things like selenium
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.320]  which dr. Wallach has been talking about for decades things like vitamin E things
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:39.840]  like glutathione and glutathione builders things like glutamine substances
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:44.240]  like glycine there's a whole vitamin C there's a whole list that's what I wanted
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.920]  to talk about I want to talk about what it's doing to us and then solutions and
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:52.760]  not just the incredible souped-up products at m4sHealth.com that my
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:57.440]  shelf my wife my mother you know we're all my dad are having dramatic effects
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.680]  especially my dad looks like he's younger it's incredible it looks looks
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:06.200]  better than I do it was starting to take things that actually are able to block
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.320]  and even reverse a lot of this just with the normal building blocks I want you to
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:14.840]  tell people they go to m4sHealth.com or m4sTeam.com or call the toll free
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:19.200]  number on the site to ask any questions of our great team what they should get
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:23.000]  there to reverse it or what even natural foods will have it unfortunately
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.960]  they're spraying it on there that's why you guys mine the stuff out of alluvial
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.880]  deposits for the beyond Tangierine and things like that so it gets passed all
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.760]  the roundup and fluoride that's soaked into it but specifically we know girls
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:42.680]  worldwide usually wanted to puberty at 13 to 14 now the age is 9, 10, 11 and we
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.880]  hear about you know seven-year-olds having babies now three-year-olds going
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:51.000]  into puberty it's an epidemic and the media just says give them other
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.280]  hormones to block it don't ask where it's coming from what's going on because
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.800]  the studies I have a stack of are gonna be showing to TV viewers right here they
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.760]  admit that it's what's doing it to the girls and that hey take it out of the
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:07.880]  plastics don't eat this don't do that but then the White House and media
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.040]  matters they don't want us to warn women well here's the thing Alex all of the
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.600]  things that we're talking about the chemicals in the food the prescription
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:18.920]  drugs a statin drugs fluoride in the water all of these things do one have
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:22.680]  one important effect on the body and from that important effect all of the
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:27.680]  other effects arise all of these substances reduce the body's ability to
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:33.600]  thrive reduce the body's ability to grow reduce the body's ability to be
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:38.800]  as great as the human body can be so estrogen for example is a stress hormone
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.720]  people don't realize this people hear about estrogen and they think about youth
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:46.240]  or they think about women of femininity but really estrogen is a hormone that
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:51.280]  helps the body handle stressors so that when your estrogen levels go up your
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:56.360]  body goes into stress response mode that means the immune system is suppressed
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:00.600]  and that means our ability to grow and and to thrive is suppressed only two
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:03.840]  things that are happening in the body at any one time we're either why is it
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:06.720]  causing because I had you know I had a lady that beat the Supreme Court on the
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.200]  gene patent and she was she was a real expert going over oh yes well this is
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:13.440]  what the estrogen mammary does and it it does this to the cell and then
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.840]  triggers this genetic trait but she was explaining there's a bunch of different
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:21.360]  ways it gives you breast cancer and more scientists believe that's the reason
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:25.400]  it's exploding this is the reason why estrogen causes breast cancer number
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:30.040]  one it causes out-of-control growth estrogen's role in the body its main
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:33.040]  role in the body in addition to being a stress hormone is to help it grow a
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:37.480]  baby so estrogen makes cells divide rapidly and then estrogen suppresses
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:41.480]  the immune system so you've got two factors that combine to give you things
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:45.640]  like cancer out-of-control growth and suppression of the immune system under
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:49.320]  ordinary circumstances the immune system will spot a cell that's growing out of
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.000]  control and destroy it but with estrogen when estrogen mimickers are in the
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.160]  body or when estrogen levels are high the immune system is suppressed and this
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:01.760]  in combination with estrogen's growth stimulating properties is what accounts
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.880]  for these reproductive cancers and make no mistake about it breast cancer is an
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:11.160]  epidemic and the number one cause of breast cancer is elevations in estrogen
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:14.400]  and the number one cause of elevations in estrogen is what are called Xeno or
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:19.120]  foreign estrogens from plastics and from foods and from chemicals estrogen is
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:24.280]  really a family of compounds it's a basic chemical structure that's found
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:27.960]  throughout nature and when organic chemists are making plastics and they're
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:32.280]  making artificial chemicals in an organic chemistry kind of way that's
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.960]  right let me just interrupt and put breastcancer.org a big new study that
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:41.480]  came out last year a common plastic chemical BPA is shown to affect breast
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:45.480]  development in fetal monkeys and in other studies makes the monkeys go into
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.840]  puberty earlier and grow giant breasts and also giant butts which is exactly
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:54.000]  what's happening to our women and our boys but I guess that's okay because I'm
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.320]  anti-gay if I talk about it. Well you know what before before I go I want to
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:03.000]  tell people three easy ways to protect yourself from Xeno estrogens and let me
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.120]  to make no mistake about it folks you want to protect yourself from these
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.720]  gender benders you want not only do you not want to interface with them if
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.760]  possible but as I was saying earlier sometimes you can't prevent yourself from
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:16.600]  interfacing in the foods there's some wonderful ways to detox one of the
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:20.320]  simplest things you could do is get yourself on progesterone cream or
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:25.120]  pregnant alone both of which have anti-estrogenic properties vitamin E is
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.760]  one of the most powerful anti-estrogenic substances and it's nothing more than a
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:32.320]  simple supplement that you could take and as I was saying earlier selenium is
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:36.120]  a powerful powerful anti-estrogenic substance. Vitamin A selenium and
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:40.440]  progesterone cream for men or women. Both men or women absolutely and
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:44.000]  pregnant alone as well and good nutrition in general is a great
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.480]  strategy essential fatty acids probiotics get on the nightly essence from
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:53.400]  longevity correct digestive issues if you want to pick one health strategy to
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.440]  increase your longevity and protect yourself from cancer and from Xeno

[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.800]  higher risks for estrogen toxicity from Xeno estrogen Xeno estrogens and
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:18.560]  pesticides look I don't have some vendetta against the White House run
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.720]  media matters but they're on record run by the transition she funded by George
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:26.800]  Soros they attack constantly on this and and so does then the so-called liberal
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:30.320]  media they're really authoritarians you know just camouflaging their
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:36.560]  authoritarianism with trendy lisping voices why are they so threatened by the
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:40.200]  fact that I'm exposing that they're that that were being chemically manipulated
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:44.480]  regardless if it's on purpose which we know it is they prove it's on purpose
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.280]  that they're that they're demonizing us when we talk about this and desperately
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:53.800]  trying to get their audience not to do what we're saying because I mean this is
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:58.040]  outrageous I mean I've got I don't want my family to die of breast cancer I don't
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:02.520]  want to get testicular cancer I don't want to be able to go you know jog five
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:05.840]  miles and swim a mile and a half and not lose weight because of all the
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:09.520]  estrogen in the environment you know the government afraid of us is a good
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.200]  thing that when the government's afraid of the people that's when you have
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:15.440]  liberty when the people are afraid of the government that's when you have
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.040]  tyranny and that's a quote from a guy named Barnhill who was a writer back in
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:22.280]  the 19th century so the fact that the government and the power structure is
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:26.080]  afraid of you that's a good thing keep up the good work don't stop no but I
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:29.800]  mean it just shows how cold-blooded they are absolutely a statement that
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:34.040]  there's no evidence that these chemicals are bad for you that's a quote what it
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.960]  is exactly the adjective reptilian exactly you hit the nail right on the
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:42.800]  head which means psychopath cold-blooded is it you couldn't have said it better
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:48.080]  I mean I mean how do you say that there's no evidence that this hurts you
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:52.960]  when every study just thousands of articles everywhere University says
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.760]  it's horrible and they're even under public pressure pulling it out of a lot
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:01.200]  of stuff Lenin said Lenin said a lie goes halfway around the world before the
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:06.280]  truth even puts on its shoes repeat a lie often enough and unfortunately it
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:11.160]  becomes it becomes the truth yeah but I mean how can you do that when you've
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:16.120]  got families I mean how do you sit there and walk around in the public looking
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:19.960]  at men women and children and not want to tell them hey the most plastic
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:23.840]  containers are gonna give you cancer and it's not like I mean it's like worse
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:28.440]  than cigarettes in the statistics I've seen I mean this is bad not people
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.320]  actually are taking prescription drugs that are estrogen voluntarily lining up
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:36.160]  at the pharmacy to take these substances what do you think birth control
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:39.520]  pills are and by the way after a woman takes her birth control pills you know
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:43.200]  where they end up in the water supply for all of us to drink that's right we
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:47.520]  are we're literally swimming in this stuff Alex our bodies our tissues are
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.160]  being saturated with these kinds of talk oh and March when Russell in the 20s
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:57.560]  wrote about it and HD Wells wrote about it in 1900 and Aldous Huxley part of it
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:01.920]  wrote about it great new world and then in a nonfiction book bragging they're
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:06.480]  doing it we have them bragging now we're swimming in it but we're crazy

[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:13.880]  studio with us I'm looking forward to that ladies and gentlemen it is so
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:20.920]  frustrating but also angry to have the White House through its surrogates
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:26.200]  they're really coming after us on this estrogen mimicry thing because this is
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:33.760]  their plan to where young boys are given female hormones and so they then
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:38.280]  begin to basically because we have pretty similar brains pretty similar
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:44.280]  anatomy in most respects we don't have a uterus but they can trigger a male you
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:50.760]  can give animals estrogen type mimicers and they begin to show same-sex type
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:56.280]  behavior and this is a takeover of our society I mean look at all the anti
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:01.240]  family anti male anti heterosexual stuff on television everywhere and my
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:05.520]  thing is I'm a live and let live guy I'm a libertarian but that doesn't mean you
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:10.680]  get to run over me that doesn't mean you get to define my sexuality for me and
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:17.640]  then write books about it the 20s and I'm gonna show an in-game that's a
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:22.200]  Freudian slip I'm gonna show an Obama deception too that's gonna have eugenics
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:26.520]  in it it's really kind of in-game too but in a way I'm gonna show it you know in
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.520]  this all the documents the books the quotes and then show you how they did
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:36.440]  it just so people get what's going on it just makes me so upset that they take
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:41.000]  one little part of an hour-long breakdown of how it's giving us breast
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.120]  cancer gesticular cancer making the you know the fish asexual or or
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:50.200]  hemaphrodites on and on and on and how a hemaphroditic mutations are
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:54.680]  increasing in humans and they go what are you against hemaphrodites I'm like
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:57.920]  no these chemicals are doing this to be like you know chemicals were giving us
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.080]  cleft palates and I'm like you know these chemicals are causing more cleft
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:04.040]  palates which they are in studies especially in Mexico where it's really
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:09.680]  toxic what do you against people with cleft palates with you know hair lips use
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:14.680]  the old pejorative I mean it's like no I don't want people to have to have that
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:19.560]  surgery when they're little babies they're like yeah right racist and it's
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:23.000]  just like it's like they've dumbed everything down where it's all just you
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.200]  don't like gay people you don't like black people I'm like hey these
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.720]  laurecon quista groups are like racist Mexican groups I you know the
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:34.160]  government's funding this why are they shut up racist hey our government's
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:38.320]  funding al-qaeda shut up 9-11 truth or all I'm saying is they created them and
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.560]  let them attack us and they're taking our rights away and now they say al-qaeda is
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:48.680]  not the threat it's gun owners oh yeah well just shut up you traitor that guy
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:55.400]  says that you know the army blew up the World Trade Center no I didn't I said
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:58.760]  our government is protecting al-qaeda and giving them a free pass to do whatever
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:04.600]  they want and then beyond it's undebatable look at all over the news
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:09.000]  and I'm sitting here watching this craziness and I can't these people are
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.400]  so evil that work for the system they will demonize me to the ends of the
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.840]  earth for simply trying to help people and people can't believe it like I
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:23.840]  can't believe you're so nice you you get so nice they're putting a thousands of
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:28.200]  plastic combinations that are even cheaper on record I've had top chemist on
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.960]  it's on record and they choose the varieties that off all this estrogen and
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:41.600]  other deadly stuff I mean they know roundup is an estrogen mimiker I saw new
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:44.640]  vegetables are coming out genetically engineered so bugs won't eat them with
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:49.080]  scorpion poison that grows in them pharmacologically I mean I saw that
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.160]  didn't even come it's just I'm living in the twilight zone and I'm like hey we
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:55.080]  probably don't want to eat tomatoes but guys type in new vegetables have
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:59.160]  scorpion poison in them I'm like scorpion poison doesn't sound too good

[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:56.440]  wonderful I got to get through I'm a longtime listener I'm 31 years old I'm
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:01.040]  a native from Puerto Rican from Puerto Rico I went to school there from head
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:09.360]  starts sixth grade my my question to you is with this Michael Hastings passing
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:14.720]  away why would they want to learn and Snowden knowing that what happened to
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:20.720]  him what do you mean alert Snowden explain that to me like why would they
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.200]  want him to come back to the country if they know what they do the whistleblowers
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:29.360]  like why would the media spin it like you know it should be a good thing that
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.280]  he returns back oh yeah come and be thrown in prison for reporting on crimes
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:40.640]  of government come back to Nazi Germany come back absolutely look a lot of
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:43.480]  people are trying to spin it with no evidence that he's some double-edged or
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:47.960]  something he released what everybody already knew I mean the CIA director last
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:50.560]  year bragged they listened to you through your appliances in your house
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:57.280]  without warrants so I mean you know the big news is the family's now been out
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:02.680]  for four days and friends saying they believed he was probably killed they
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:06.840]  want to do investigation gee you probably think that'd be news that is
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:14.680]  nowhere but info wars.com that I've seen I checked it this morning nowhere but
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:20.560]  info wars.com nowhere I mean they could blow me up and have my wife going I
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.760]  want an investigation and it wouldn't be in the news think about that precedent
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:28.720]  how much danger we're in and people say well why are you trying to scare us I'm
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:33.480]  just laying out the reality that that's what I do I can't help it I mean and
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:38.440]  again most the government isn't bad but they're not the ones in charge and the
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:43.000]  danger is letting them do this I appreciate your call so I start talking
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.280]  about this and it just freaks me out
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:53.680]  Eric in Wisconsin you're on the air go ahead hey brother that's good talk to
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:57.640]  you again I called in a while ago and what I want to say real quick is just
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:01.720]  the fact that if I'm out there is feeling really down on yourself or you feel
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:06.440]  like everything's going wrong for you I want you to know that not your fault
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:12.760]  from a young age I was really unhappy I really messed up kid until I found God
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:17.720]  personally not through any church or any man-made police system but the change
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:21.000]  that I've experienced in my life is incredible because when I was a kid I
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:27.160]  was cursed I was cursed with unbelievably bad things but I just want
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:31.240]  everyone to know if you feel bad go to God because God can cure everything no
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:34.600]  listen all the studies even the atheists have to admit it if they're
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:41.000]  scientists not the political ones that prayer and real personal spiritual
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:49.960]  activity who hires you know the the the awakening ups the brainwaves and is
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:54.560]  miraculous over illness you name it and they try to put a box around it to have
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:58.280]  man control it but that's what Jesus talked about was the Pharisees and
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:02.200]  Sadducees you know doing their works before men instead of before God
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:07.240]  absolutely if you don't like thinking yourself as bad and say oh God can't help
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:12.000]  me just say God I want to be good will you help me be a better person and even
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.640]  if you don't believe in God as it as a physical you know deity the universe
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:22.960]  justice it just works it will it will attract the positive to you and people
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:27.160]  say oh you know that's new agey no I look I get more people to come to Christ on
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:30.320]  this show without beating people over the head with it by just getting them to
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:34.120]  think then they have their own spiritual experience and then that that leads them
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:38.680]  to you know much better things the world took over the churches and had them
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:44.200]  beat people over the head so that people would turn away the globalists are
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.640]  very very smart ladies and gentlemen they know what they're doing but there's
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:52.520]  definitely a spiritual place in our heart in our mind the pineal gland our
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:57.040]  DNA now they've proven is a receiver transmitter that's a scientific fact I
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:03.520]  mean this is heavy stuff why does the United States spend the largest percentage
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:07.960]  of GDP in the world on health care why do we have the highest cancer rates on
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:13.760]  the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and every other major disease
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:19.200]  it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid of

[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:47.600]  many interviews and so much research gonna be the best film ever the very
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:52.600]  powerful wake folks up you're here and we really appreciate you being in town
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:55.720]  I've met you in person a few times before but you've taken me around New
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:59.200]  York and stuff but here you are in Austin Texas my friend well I have to
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:04.440]  say I'm really thankful that you invited me number one and number two you know
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:10.840]  I've been on everybody's show from Oprah today shows CNN you name it and and
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:16.120]  around the world and I have to say your studios here are as great as anything
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:21.600]  else out there and I'm really really impressed about the great operation that
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:28.320]  you have the staff that you have and the professionalism it's it's first rate
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:35.840]  and and it it compares and now I know why that you so many people listen to you
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:39.160]  and follow you because this is a first-rate operation well we're trying
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:43.520]  to get there I'm trying to get there I'm kind of a weak link but we're building
[02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:47.080]  the new studio I've got the uplink spreading a bunch of other stuff I'm
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:50.520]  gonna have to really hustle to raise the money to get this completed but by
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:56.200]  next year we probably will be to the next level of reaching more than 15
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:59.280]  million people a week we're already reaching that but I want to just double
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:02.560]  that because I don't want to just fight these people and and do half measures
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:05.640]  that's what I like about you is that you're doing the same thing Gerald you're
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:09.120]  escalating what you're doing you're doubling down America you're not fleeing
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:13.320]  I want to get into all the news and your analysis but first let's talk about why
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:16.720]  I'm interviewing you for the Obama deception I mean you're you're saying
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:20.320]  you're not fleeing a lot of big guys have been leaving the US quietly we're not
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:25.080]  going to say their names you've you've talked about doubling down yes I have but
[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:29.120]  before we do that I'd also like to say in seeing the effort that you're doing
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:33.160]  and what it takes for everybody out there that's listening to do what you
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:38.960]  can to support this and the people that that are speaking out and aren't afraid
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:43.600]  to speak out because if you look at the other side I mean you were talking
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:48.000]  about the Obama deception how about this for a deception remember when Obama was
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:53.400]  running in 2008 and he said he would never accept a penny of outside money and
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:57.360]  only the people's money and wouldn't take money from special interests and of
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:02.000]  course who funds his campaigns are the special interests so if you're a special
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.200]  interest out there in the interest of living a life of dignity and respect in
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:11.720]  an America that you were taught to love because of the fundamentals upon which
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.920]  it was built you know this is really a time to put your money where your mouth
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:21.960]  is and you know we need support from the people we the people and so in seeing
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:26.280]  your operation and seeing what it takes to to make it happen I really urge
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:30.400]  everyone out there to do what they can at any level that they can if you're
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:34.920]  gonna people support a politician man whoof and you should be supporting
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:38.440]  something that's going to help you and and this is the kind I was listening to
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:42.360]  Ben Fuchs as I was waiting to go on the air you know I have an honorary doctorate
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:45.320]  in complementary medicine from the National University of Health Sciences
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.840]  and I'm listening to this interview I said wow this guy really knows his stuff
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:53.120]  and and the information the quality information that you put out that you
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:57.800]  can't get anywhere else so again you know I urge everyone and particularly now
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.280]  seeing your operation what it takes to make this happen to do what they can to
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:05.680]  buy the products that you sell and support prisonplanet.com in any way
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:10.400]  that they can well thank you I mean look I could have big giant you know
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:15.000]  mansions and just be a talk show host and have you know a jet probably but
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.560]  instead I've made the decision to fight tyranny so I'm putting technically about
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:24.920]  120% of my earnings right now I'm putting money that we put as a backup into
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:28.360]  trying to just build this up and go to the next level because that's what I
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:32.400]  want I want to beat these people I want the mercury out of the shots I want the
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:35.600]  fluoride out of the water I want the estrogen members out of the plastic I
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:39.280]  want our troops to come home I want the Federal Reserve to be kicked out of the
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:43.960]  country I want our nation back I want the warmongers in jail I mean that's
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:48.240]  what I'm after I'm not after going to globalist confabs and feeling powerful
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:54.160]  or having a butler on a private jet I'm after going 110% after these globalist
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:57.160]  I know you've been at the highest levels of things Gerald you see now the
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:01.360]  establishment operates how they're so entitled people on you know 25 million
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:06.080]  dollar jets with butlers and it's like men but could care less about what's
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:10.120]  happening to the world around them and this stuff even blows back on the
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:13.760]  elite's kids they're not getting away with this world they're creating you
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:17.360]  can see everything starting to unravel and it's crazy and I can't imagine the
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:22.120]  middle class but even nouveau riche and old money that's being fed on by the
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:25.920]  globalist they're all just in a lot of cases giving up not believing they have
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:30.200]  any power when if I'm just some guy from Texas in 18 years I've been able to do
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:35.040]  this I want to do 10 times this well what is wrong with people well it's a
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:39.280]  lot wrong and went but there's a lot wrong and there's a lot right
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:44.280]  well I agree a lot of folks waking up yeah and and you know we did a in the
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:48.160]  last trends journey I don't want to hear a trend people don't want to hear it
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.320]  they don't want to hear something that breaks their belief system they don't
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:56.280]  want to hear something that may upset them because they feel powerless to do
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:00.840]  anything but again you know the when you talk about the American Revolution and
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:04.960]  and we could talk about that as well because it leads into the question that
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:09.200]  you first asked me how many people began the American Revolution was a couple of
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:14.160]  percent there's 1% and then 3 and then 5 wanted yeah and then only I think at the
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:18.560]  height of it only about 45% of the people supported it yeah that's right I
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:22.840]  mean just just you gave moral support moral support yeah so it doesn't take it
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:25.960]  takes a small number and then if people could really understand what the
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:30.640]  opposition looks like all they have to do is open their eyes how can anybody you
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:35.560]  know hail to the chief I don't care who the chief is how could they how could they
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:41.040]  clap and applaud for for for senator Harry reader Mitch McConnell how could
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:46.400]  they look up to Bono or Bono or McCain how can how can they genuflect to their
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:51.720]  to their con men and chief whoever it might be you know what what's wrong with
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:55.600]  people how have they lost their dignity this is the level of people that we're
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:00.440]  talking about and I'm saying that we don't have to listen to them there's a
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:05.720]  quote and in preparing for the show and and looking over different things when
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:10.000]  President Obama was saying that how he was going to win the Afghan war people
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:15.400]  forget this back in 2009 when they had the troops search 33,000 more troops
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:21.320]  Hillary Clinton said you know he's not concerned about what the polls show you
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:24.800]  know the people that disgusted with the war essentially oh no we don't count
[02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:29.920]  don't look at the polls we don't count vast maturities are against the war but
[02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:35.360]  in America with a K in it it doesn't count anymore and I remember him saying
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:39.240]  that if you go back to any culture thousands of years ago if a king lost a
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:43.840]  war he would have to abdicate and step down or a new dynasty would come in
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:47.800]  because even if people were barbarous they didn't like losers on top of it
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:52.360]  these people are losers that's what I'm saying they're losers they lose
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:56.840]  everything there's nothing that you could put your finger on that says hey
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:01.960]  look at the great success let's put them up again in the cleanup spot you know
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:06.440]  so that's what I'm so the new world order losers who have made themselves too
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:09.160]  big to fail I was just watching a congressional hearing during the break
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:12.320]  in there and they were they the congressman were admitting we've made
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:15.320]  you too big to fail that's now the standard and you and you banks are
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:20.280]  taking over yeah so what what I'm saying is that people would realize that the
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:26.840]  enemy is really not an enemy they're just letting people run them and control
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:31.160]  them because they don't have the courage to say no but now the courage is
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:36.560]  coming along more people are saying no and you're leading the charge as well
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:40.120]  as I and others believe me I don't want to lead it it's dangerous but again I
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:45.600]  know it to you know I I realized that I get you know I get my share of of things
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.200]  but going back to what you saw what I'm doing I just bought recently three
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:54.080]  buildings on the most historic corner in the United States matter of fact
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:18:00.680]  listeners could go to Ulster magazine UL at ULST ER a magazine.com it's
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:05.160]  Ulster County New York and it's in Kingston New York Colonial Kingston is
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:09.280]  the magazine out yet out yeah there would be FedEx in a copy we should be
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:12.680]  getting it soon but it's on the stands out in New York now and it's on their
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:19.080]  website and what what Kingston was the first capital of New York State the
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:25.520]  British burnt it down in 1977 in 1777 and these are the houses that predated
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:30.360]  the burning and they were some of them are rebuilt but I came back from Berlin
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:35.800]  and it's about not leaving and last year not this June but the June before I
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:41.760]  came back on June 20 April excuse me April 23rd of 2012 and after being in
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:47.120]  Berlin I realized this you know this Berlin had to be at the top of Western
[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:53.040]  civilization in the 1930s and you think of the there was right it's culturally
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:57.160]  scientifically scientifically and you think of the German names not for
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:03.360]  nothing you know Bach Beethoven Kurtz Einstein Wagner and and I and here's
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:08.880]  what you see Alex I spent a lot of time in Europe and to me Berlin was
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:14.080]  grander than Paris before it was bombed out and you see a beautiful stone
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:21.080]  beautiful gorgeous building from 1880 in Berlin and then you see all new
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:25.480]  construction they're from burnt bombed out from World War two and then an old
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:29.640]  building and this footprint is repeated everywhere and I'm thinking of my
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:34.680]  how could the Germans let this happen to them how could they let a two-bit
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:39.480]  freak destroy their country and that's how and then I'll keep going on and
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:42.960]  tell you the rest of the story of why I brought and that's what inspired me to
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:47.960]  stay in America and not let any two-bit freak throw me out exactly

[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:40.640]  segment coming up but let's start finish you get your story so you're in Berlin
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:44.520]  beautiful architecture but almost all of it completely destroyed bombed out from
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:48.640]  the bombing and the Russians coming in 20 million Germans died one way or another
[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:53.840]  as they say it's 21 million for following Hitler but it was the banksters
[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:57.720]  that created the Versailles treaty and the atmosphere that allowed it and it
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:02.120]  just shows the very same cruise today show continue and then I thought to myself
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:06.320]  you know I'm of Italian descent and during the same time I mean you think of
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:11.880]  the Italian names you know Puccini Rossini Michelangelo da Vinci and we have
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:15.400]  quite a we eat a lot better than the Germans how can they let a cartoon
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:21.600]  character like Mussolini destroy their country and so I came back on April 23rd
[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:25.680]  and it was a for sale son on the Franz Rogan house that's one of the ones in
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:31.120]  the magazine is built in 1750 and I said to myself and I was down in
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:34.760]  Argentina as you know in Chile and I was getting a I was going to Uruguay I
[02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:37.440]  said enough of this crap when the earthquake happened yeah right I was on
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:42.480]  the 14th for the Crown Plus Hotel and I was looking to leave and I said to
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:47.160]  myself you can't run away there are two-bit freaks everywhere we have them
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:51.280]  right here you want to see some two-bit freaks how about Bush there's a two-bit
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:56.240]  freak for you in my book how about Obama two-bit freak how about slick Willie
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:01.020]  Clinton you want to see a freak roll them out how about go down the list
[02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:09.840]  Pelosi one Janet Napolitano you just stuff those women can settled in court
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:13.200]  with the stuff at the Justice Department they're lunatics they're lunatics
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:16.480]  and that's what I'm trying to say you go down I would how about that other guy
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:21.600]  before that church off what was their church off the other day before Napolitano
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:27.240]  well the guy on the bush cherd off him yeah the guy that was it was the
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:33.160]  consultant for naked body scanners yeah so it's two-bit freaks everywhere you
[02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:38.680]  cannot run away is my belief so I said I'm staying and so I bought that one
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:42.160]  building and then as the story goes on there's a magazine article about it let's
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:47.560]  put it on screen for folks I bought the second building the Academy 1774 and
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:53.880]  that was built in that that was where the governor Clinton not this Clinton
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:58.880]  went to school for the elites at the day and then I bought the Dr. Jansen house
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:03.240]  and I said to myself this this is the most historic four corners in the
[02:27:03.240 --> 02:27:07.160]  United States it's the only place where there's a pre-revolutionary war stone
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:11.320]  building on each corner and if this is where the first American revolution had
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:14.800]  its roots I want to see the second one again it was the first capital the
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:18.940]  British burned it yeah you are doubling tripling down with everything you've
[02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:24.160]  got to stand exact your ground and symbolically we all need to dig our
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:30.040]  heels in and fight like Hades we're not giving up and I also realize if I was
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:35.360]  in a cat Italy I would never be the guy I am I'm only on who I am because of the
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:39.520]  country that I come from that allows me to be this person I'm not locked in a
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:44.680]  cultured trap I'm free and I don't and I don't like people screwing with my
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:48.800]  freedom and so I said this is again this is where the first American
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:53.080]  revolution had its roots I want to see the second one but of course I don't
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:57.880]  want to see any violence I want this to be an intellectual a moral a spiritual
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:03.440]  a renaissance withdrawing our consent and then building with art and culture
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:08.160]  the new world exactly and just like what you're doing here with your studio you
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:11.520]  know and I'm trying to do no I'm fully committed my wife's as smart as I am or
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:15.200]  smarter she's a volumetric world and we've had real discussions about look
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:18.320]  at our children let's get out of here and I said yeah maybe we'll buy some time
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:22.280]  for a while but the only way to beat this is let's double down and so we've
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.760]  committed our family the kids everything we're on the altar of liberty yeah I've
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:30.520]  put my kids on everything it's like and with enough people behind us we could
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:35.760]  change the course again look who is rule look at the people that are ruling us
[02:28:35.760 --> 02:28:40.800]  what self-respecting human being would take these and you don't have to go look
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:44.640]  go around the world hey how about that guy Hollanda over there in France
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:48.560]  Hollanda's turns out turns out they're all exempt from the taxes and the
[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:52.480]  socialist party with a hundred percent tax rate on the middle class did you see
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:59.000]  that no I missed that no that's CNBC folks put it up 100% tax rate how's that
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.960]  sound that's great and then the socialist are exempt yeah yeah and then you see
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:07.760]  the same thing you go over to the UK Cameron and Blair I mean look at these
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:11.440]  little boys little chicken hawks can you imagine these guys leading a charge
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:15.400]  they had big mouths all these people have big mouths hey look look there is
[02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:21.240]  taxes on some wealthy French top 100% of income Reuters yep I can't even
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:25.760]  believe that but but but again you saw where it came out we're almost all the
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:29.120]  top socialist they got Swiss bank accounts don't pay taxes but they're
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:34.160]  but they can't be in they're in control so no one can stop them they're not
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:37.560]  socialist they're criminals and then you pick up today's Wall Street Journal and

[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:57.960]  I want to get your current take on how they're trying to drive down gold and
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:01.800]  silver what's happening in the global economy what's mainly on your radar the
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:06.160]  open funding of al Qaeda in Syria now how that's out in the open and then what
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:12.040]  you think of the NSA and what you think of the the Rolling Stone editors saying
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:16.040]  that they've told me now I've talked to his friends his family I found the
[02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:19.520]  quotes they've said the army has told me they're going to kill me for this
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:23.560]  story I've got a bigger one on the CIA I'm going to let's talk about that before
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:27.400]  you get back into this what's happening what do you do when we know looks
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:30.280]  clearly they killed Aaron Swartz he wasn't going to kill himself he was
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:34.040]  going to fight those fake charges this guy's car blows up the engine blows 60
[02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:38.520]  yards down the street his wife says I think he was killed I'm going to you
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:42.720]  know demand a real investigation and just and bring down quote whoever did
[02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:46.080]  this I talked to his army buddy he goes oh yeah it looks like he was killed this
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:50.040]  on the show a couple days ago this is nowhere in the news that the widow and
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:53.400]  his best buddy think he was probably killed and are calling for investigation
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.000]  they're attacking me saying I'm a conspiracy theorist and shouldn't question
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:02.040]  it what do we do when stuff like that's going on you have to tune out I mean I
[02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:05.920]  was watching the news today I watch it every day because I have to to see what
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:10.760]  they're talking about but why don't we talk about Trayvon Martin how about that
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:15.200]  the Hernandez guy and we could go on and on and talk about nothing so they
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:20.240]  become complicit they they the presses in this country there is no fourth
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:29.000]  estate so the reality is is that the CIA the FBI the NSA have been lying to us
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:34.480]  forever why would anybody believe anything that they say so of course you
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:38.200]  take it with a grain of salt when they went how about the whole Boston
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:44.480]  Marathon I mean you did a wonderful info wars we had it on the cover I mean
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:50.720]  we have no information about that the the story kept changing by the minute
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:55.040]  they're killing witnesses left and right yeah they and how again I remember the
[02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:58.880]  story that they robbed a 7-eleven I didn't rob a 7-eleven oh there was a gun
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:02.720]  fight between a kid when he was in the boat and and it was no gunfight they
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:05.120]  didn't have that they had all these weapons and I didn't have all those
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:10.840]  weapons so what about the Snowden to me there's nothing new that we haven't
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:16.240]  written about in the trends journal over a year and a half ago two years ago in
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:20.640]  chapter and verse and we even when we wrote about it we said that this news
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:26.680]  was coming out and nobody seems to care about it we even use that language so
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:31.720]  Snowden hasn't said anything new the only thing that's different with Snowden
[02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:37.120]  is he has the hard proof with him but there's not a thing that he said that
[02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:42.760]  hasn't been written about or talked about by myself and others what was like
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:47.640]  I Bramford or James Bamford yeah he's right but I mean the CIA director Bragg
[02:38:47.640 --> 02:38:51.120]  they were spying on us without warrants but it's okay when he's saying it's good
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:57.760]  yeah so so again it's a it's what I've said from the very beginning when the
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:03.440]  whole too big to fail began and people would call Obama communist and a Marxist
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:08.160]  and all of this I said no it's fascism it's the merger state and corporate
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:14.320]  powers so the behavior is perfectly acceptable under a fascist regime this
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:17.960]  is what to expect and they're caught they're consciously converting us to
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:21.880]  that because that's the only system they're gonna survive in as tyrants I
[02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:26.400]  mean that's why it's a no-brainer so what do we do we start buying local we
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:30.840]  start withdrawing our consent from the system we don't support any big chains
[02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:35.160]  what else do we do well again you're one of the things I my motto was in the
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:40.360]  last election stay home don't vote if we get people we get under 40% of the
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:44.800]  people that don't voting and we could we would then we could really say that no
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:47.960]  this is not a representative form of government but have them say we withdraw
[02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:51.480]  consent because we say this is this is not a real process it's not a real
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:55.040]  process what do we get we have the Republicans and the Democrats you know
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:59.640]  they've done it before we could hold alternate elections again boycott this
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:05.360]  this mafia and yeah that's another one so again it has to begin at the grass
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:09.160]  room again and one of the ones that I keep suggesting is pushes for direct
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:13.560]  democracy as I mentioned Hillary said she didn't care what the polls showed
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:18.280]  we're gonna do more in Afghanistan you don't see Chelsea over there in
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:23.560]  uniform Bill didn't go to war Obama didn't go to war none of these guys did
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:26.600]  let the people vote you want to go to war let the people you know I read about
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:29.600]  this years ago and kind of forgot about it but I went and looked it up last week
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:34.120]  they have thousands of troops forced in their contract into a third fourth fifth
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:39.680]  sixth seventh tour with parts of their feet or what are their whole foot blown
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:45.320]  off they're sticking prosthesis on people and saying get in there Marine

[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:08.280]  actually the women they keep the kids and then they go oh my gosh the heteros
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:13.200]  you know on the show if it's on my phone I took a photo of it the movie

[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:21.000]  kids are here and then it shows the cop taking out the dad and I mean the bad
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:25.400]  guys are dads and they have a gay and lesbian thing at the White House with
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:30.080]  little girls introducing it and they have articles about oh Elmo you know the
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:33.840]  creator of it says it's good and oh Burton Ernie they say it's good that
[02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:38.640]  they're gay and it's good for your kids to be gay I'm not even against quote gay
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:42.920]  people but I'm against sexualizing children how is it okay to sexualize
[02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:46.880]  kids if it's homosexual versus heterosexual how is it okay to have the
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:51.280]  dog with her leg spread on top of her the Irish Wolfhound I mean what why are
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:55.080]  they obsessed with this what why are they shoving it down our throats again
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:59.200]  it's sick at every level as mentioning that like they took us to the Vietnam
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:04.640]  War we lost 58,000 people 250 committed thousand committed suicide and a bunch
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:08.360]  of guys I know of you know half out of their mind from going there then they
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:13.960]  lost in Afghanistan we've lost in Iraq they destroyed Libya and now they're
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:19.120]  talking about Syria it's lunacy at every level but they make money exactly and
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:23.400]  they're actually winning the globalist are sucking America dry that's all they
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:27.120]  destroy other countries and that oh you were talking about Snowden this isn't
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:32.680]  about NSA spying it's about another aspect of the military industrial complex
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:38.200]  it's the cyber industrial complex according to the Financial Times we the
[02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:45.080]  people are spending 80 billion dollars a year on national security where is it
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:48.960]  going hey you know the guy that's the head of the end of booze Allen a great
[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:53.080]  name for the company too right booze Allen Mike McConnell you know where he
[02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:59.880]  was before he was CEO of yes yeah how many years under a Clinton 1992 it's all
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:03.480]  a payoff six NSA who's ahead of the NS I was reading where some of these
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:07.960]  companies are getting 10 billion a year to spy on us and then they're allowed to
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.740]  use the intelligence in their other corporate divisions yep against
[02:45:11.740 --> 02:45:17.960]  competition yep and and this is the rub oh this guy Snowden you know he he's
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:22.200]  jeopardized the national security the United States by spilling these what
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:26.680]  secrets that they're spying on us but they here's the here's the thing we're
[02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:34.760]  not allowed to know a damn thing about it but yet they hire 850,000 according to
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:39.080]  the financial times 800 plus thousand right and but they're allowed to watch
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:43.520]  us but we're not allowed to watch anybody or know anything listen every time
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:49.160]  I've been with national film crews in DC 200 yards from the monument and they
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:53.280]  go up to families filming and say turn that off the police just to dominate in
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:56.200]  the security guards and they come to the camera go well this city doesn't give
[02:45:56.200 --> 02:45:59.920]  permits to film plus we don't need one to do like mainstream film channels and
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:03.600]  the cops was turned it off you're going to jail and then I and then families in
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:07.440]  front of the White House with their iPhones out taping secret service comes
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:11.280]  over in plain clothes but also in police outfits and threatens you and they're
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:14.640]  laughing and I go well this country in free and they go you're right now move
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:18.880]  it I mean and then they have all these movies with a White House is being blown
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:23.240]  up to create the illusion that it's under attack yeah I mean it's a joke I
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:28.200]  live in North Korea and that's why we need the second American Revolution I
[02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:32.880]  don't know how these feds because it wasn't just us and film crews because
[02:46:32.880 --> 02:46:35.040]  you know we were clean-cut and good-looking I couldn't imagine if we
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:38.280]  weren't they would go over to families and go ma'am don't film the White House
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:43.040]  she'd be across the park like to her and she go I'm here my kids I'm gonna make
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:48.640]  this easy and you and you want to go over and punch the guy in the nose this
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:53.600]  is what's going on and so it's a loss of liberty at every every step of what is
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:58.400]  wrong with how do they get people to act like this I just was there's a whole
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:01.400]  profile again you're looking at all the people that are but you know they did
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:04.800]  people probably have empty lives and they're getting fulfilled by we have
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:08.960]  footage of this in Kansas City where my crew is filming the Federal Reserve from
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:13.160]  500 yards away at a city park and Federal Reserve security guards with guns
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:17.400]  come over and go we said leave it's gonna get rough and my guys have been told
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:20.320]  not to get confrontations and we went but first amendment they go this isn't
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:24.080]  even your property they go we told you leave or it's gonna be hard on you yeah
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:30.160]  and then it was in the newspaper yeah that was a total official oppression Alex
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:36.480]  they closed down a hundred square miles for Boston shelter in place made
[02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:40.040]  people stay in their home yeah let's find that show that go ahead right yeah
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:44.080]  hundreds to get a 19 year old kid that's the other thing I've been thinking
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:48.680]  about look at these look at these look at the people that have destabilized the
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:53.480]  American government look at these treacherous people Bradley Manning now
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:57.760]  there's a real one you have to watch out this little poor guy Bradley Manning
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:01.800]  this 19 year old kid that they got in the hospital and that from the Boston
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:07.880]  Marathon and this guy Snowden I mean look at these these the young guys and
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:13.280]  they make these young guys to their there are threats to national security I
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:17.760]  mean that's how sick it's been oh they they bomb boss and the feds did it we
[02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:21.760]  we've got all the evidence but I'm just you know we got behind the kids that they
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:25.200]  know I know they get four patsy yeah yeah like it looks like Manning isn't
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:28.120]  probably the one that actually released much of it they even know that they're
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:33.720]  just burning him because he's easy yeah but again look at look at the faces look
[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:37.240]  at the faces that are a threat to America well if you I'm sure you saw the
[02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:40.680]  videos in Boston where women would walk out and they would aim guns and then
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:43.400]  the women would get the street put their hands down and the cops would push them
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:47.120]  and go get your hands back up it was an excuse to have just an orgy that
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:51.360]  everyone was a terrorist now they have a flood in a city in Canada or here they
[02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:55.880]  lock down everything and rob everybody's guns yeah it's shelter in place I mean
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:49:00.280]  you can't make this stuff up so again this is why we have to either go in a
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:04.720]  new direction because if we stay on the one we're on it's cooked I want to
[02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:09.960]  mention also about the economy you asked me again oh again it is happening
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:14.160]  here look look at that picture in today's toilet paper record the New York
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:20.760]  Times we'll give folks a document cam shot of that right at the guy people oh
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:25.040]  my gosh he's such an evil protester right look at him and there's another one
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:28.760]  in today's tell the listeners what's happening there it just shows a
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:33.120]  protester faced off against the police before a soccer match in Brazil on
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:37.480]  Thursday but I mean at least the Brazilians are they say they're sick of
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:40.840]  government corruption sick of government here's another one here look at this one
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:44.460]  it's the same thing everywhere here look at this one let's see we've got the
[02:49:44.460 --> 02:49:48.240]  estrogen in our water so we don't know yeah we don't have people to stand up
[02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:51.840]  here that's in that's in Portugal it's going on all over the world it's in
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:58.000]  Turkey on Sunday there's going to be a big demonstration in Egypt and they're
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:03.840]  already warning the Egyptian secularists by the way are saying that the
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:08.360]  United States is behind the Islamic Brotherhood government of Morsi and
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:12.360]  they're against the secularists you could read of course yeah they always put
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:16.080]  the radicals in and now this is what the secularists anyway so there's a big
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:20.800]  showdown coming in Egypt and the military may step in again again you go
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:24.880]  to you go to Portugal you go to Brazil oh oh because they know those radical
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:30.400]  Muslims wreck those countries exactly and then you go 35 killed already in
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:35.440]  China in the Xinjiang province people around the world are demonstrating
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:39.000]  against their gut the greatest fear by the way that the Chinese government has
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:44.200]  are the people that is there to explain that and why worldwide because we're
[02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:47.240]  really in a depression that you and others predicted the media is not just
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:51.400]  telling us in a little isolated pockets people are doing okay but overall by
[02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:54.280]  every metric I've had countless economists on we've been in a depression

[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:46.360]  who knows he might be on the nightly news but it's really a treat to have
[02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:50.960]  him here in town with us we got a lot of big ideas cooking with Gerald as well
[02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:53.440]  you may hear about the next few months we'll just leave it at that Gerald
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:55.920]  finishing up with the global depression five years you agree with
[02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:59.960]  analysis by all the metrics and that's why this stuff's also happening and you
[02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:03.520]  predicted you said when they lose everything they lose it yeah and then
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:08.120]  they take it a war so now let's look what's going on we saw the stock markets
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:12.560]  go through this roller coaster ride since Ben Bernanke Osama Ben Bernanke
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:16.560]  public enemy number one announced that they would be tapering off on their
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:24.360]  stimulus gold of course is is it's lost so much strength since that has happened
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:29.240]  and then we look at behind it the markets let me get this straight now the
[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:33.480]  markets are going down because they say there's not going to be any more
[02:55:33.480 --> 02:55:40.000]  stimulus however everyone admits that the stimulus has not stimulated the
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:43.560]  economy the only thing it's done it's gone to the bankers in the financial
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:48.520]  situation in the financial institutions for them to make money because as we
[02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:53.720]  look since the great depression began the greatest depression the jobs that
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:56:01.680]  were lost between 2008 and 2013 are mostly middle-income paying jobs this
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:08.760]  is a fact the jobs that have been created are mostly low-paying wage jobs
[02:56:08.760 --> 02:56:14.520]  that aren't enough to have to to maintain a standard of living a working
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:19.160]  wage here are the jobs that have been created you want a job as a bartender
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:23.320]  or waitress there's a job waiting for you someplace do you want a job in
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:28.400]  hospitality wonderful word for cleaning up and and and making beds and hotels
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:32.200]  and that kind of thing you can maybe find a job there they're creating some
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:39.400]  there temporary workers no benefits no pensions no nothing nothing and in China
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:42.640]  they're replacing the people with robots where does it all end so you look at the
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:47.800]  jobs that are being created they're all low-paying jobs manufacturing jobs are
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:51.720]  being lost when you mentioned China you're being lost here and over there
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:56.520]  and oh that's the other part of the equation by the way China is also in a
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:00.960]  slowdown they have a liquidity crisis and they're saying we're not going to dump
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:04.760]  more dough into this to keep the Ponzi scheme going but it's bigger than a
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:08.880]  liquidity crisis is a debt crisis because the banks just like they were
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:13.200]  doing here the hot money has been flowing into real estate you hear about
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:17.600]  so what do you predicts gonna happen will they keep the QE going or will they
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:21.560]  stop it their naked shorting to drive down gold artificially Ron Paul says
[02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:25.680]  it'll go to infinity once that stops I agree with Ron Paul that what I but I
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:30.080]  don't know what they're going to do but I do know this and so does everybody
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:34.360]  else read the headline in today's business section of the USA today
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:39.960]  mortgage rate parties over I mentioned to you that I bought those buildings I
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:48.200]  got a 2.875 percent interest rate on one of them and that was in February so
[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:53.320]  that's an oddly I hedged my bets by doing this without having any intention
[02:57:53.320 --> 02:58:02.280]  of doing so now mortgage rates are up to 4 30 years now up to 4.46 percent it's
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:09.280]  a 30 year fixed rate rose to 4.6 percent the highest in almost two years up from
[02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:16.200]  under 4 percent a week ago and they've gone up some 20 and I remember you said
[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:19.520]  that about a year ago you said by the end of 2013 I think you put it one of
[02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:24.040]  your publications that they were gonna in the QE how'd you know that because
[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:27.360]  they can't keep this going on forever interest rate that's what you said last
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:31.400]  year exact exact quote yeah so where is it going to end we're going to go into
[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:35.520]  worse conditions than what we saw in 2008 we're gonna come back take calls and
[02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:38.920]  explain what that's gonna mean what you think's coming out of that overdrive

[03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:17.080]  about was this whole NSA spying thing I've been a kid of like the 90s and
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:21.440]  growing up with the internet and learning all about it and on the internet
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:24.880]  specific boards we used to have a term for when the FBI used to show up at your
[03:01:24.880 --> 03:01:30.040]  house used to call it the party van and a lot of us a lot of the hacktivist groups
[03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:33.960]  and people that I know who've been on the internet using it to expose the truth
[03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:37.760]  about government cover-ups and shitty emails that they send to each other
[03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:43.160]  sorry I'm gonna have to let you go bro what was your question oh yeah my
[03:01:43.160 --> 03:01:47.200]  question was this like how do you feel like knowing that like this is a thing
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:51.600]  that's been happening for a really long time to us the younger generation and
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:56.520]  well I mean I mean the government always practices unconstitutional stuff on
[03:01:56.520 --> 03:02:01.840]  young people on on on poor people on minorities people they think can't
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:05.160]  protect themselves and then groups who think they're protected always think
[03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:08.320]  they're safe all that's just happened to them and then it ends up happening to
[03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:13.400]  everybody Gerald Solente your take on that well again yours is more the same
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:16.440]  you know there's nothing new about it they just go after anybody they can and
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:19.040]  if they get there that's the young hacktivist because they were the ones
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:22.960]  that were ahead of the game on on understanding what the the whole
[03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:26.920]  computer revolution was and they grew up with it so they had more knowledge of
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:30.640]  it than most other people absolutely and I think the hacktivist community are
[03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:34.820]  some of the best people out there most of what they do is good exposing
[03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:38.520]  corruption and usually at some corporation or criminals they're doing
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:42.360]  bad things with hacking but hacking in and of itself you know how it was
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:46.880]  started was done from a Liberty perspective people like Dr. Stallman and
[03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:51.040]  others I mean I just see good work out of the hackers happy hacking Sargent

[03:03:38.840 --> 03:03:42.280]  of the early guys got on like 300 stations at one time even before Rush
[03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:45.960]  Limbaugh and then kind of faded through with him who talked about the New World
[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:50.320]  Order and stuff uh-huh just a really splendid person never got the
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:53.840]  attention either but the Midwest and stuff he was king I mean he's on over

[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:02.680]  people that woke me up kind of you know was he just really is amazing person
[03:04:02.680 --> 03:04:07.400]  anything else sir oh yes I'd like to salute you for exposing the crimes of
[03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:13.280]  vaccines and psychotropic drugs since my son went through this nightmare for
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:18.560]  like three or four months and I got to see it up close and to talk to patients
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:23.520]  and these mental behavior units are killing pills and I really appreciate
[03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:28.720]  what you're you're doing and yeah well the doctors and most of them know what
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:32.360]  the vaccines are doing but they're mandated to do it outside of law so
[03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:35.080]  they're gonna cover it up but I mean all the doctors I talked to you know
[03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:38.840]  Gerald yeah no they what they're doing also is these kids coming from broken
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:42.160]  families of socially troubled families now they're not giving them any help at
[03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:46.320]  all other than psychotropic drugs and that's no help at all well it's basically
[03:04:46.320 --> 03:04:49.120]  they might as well just give them lobotomies that's what they're doing yeah
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:52.120]  these drugs do that in all the shots we'll be back with more calls with

[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:55.400]  i'm awake i'm trying to wake my wife up she's a tv head my main question is is

[03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:04.760]  body in order or is it more important to just jump out
[03:10:04.760 --> 03:10:08.120]  into activism and take on a new world or head strong
[03:10:08.120 --> 03:10:11.320]  oh yeah let me say this and i'll put you on hold and come back to you for for
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:15.640]  audio issues but let me just be clear people look at me and i'm not the most
[03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:19.400]  photogenic person i mean when in person people say man you look a lot skinnier
[03:10:19.400 --> 03:10:22.600]  than you are on air the camera adds weight especially to certain people
[03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:26.280]  but when i say because i mismentioned info wars team and young jevity a
[03:10:26.280 --> 03:10:29.640]  minute ago not knowing the next caller was about to bring that up
[03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:33.400]  um i saw it with erin dykes losing 90 something
[03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:36.280]  pounds it's not even advertised as weight loss
[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:39.480]  i saw it with my wife having incredible results
[03:10:39.480 --> 03:10:43.080]  tata anderson having incredible results with the stuff they've got for osteo
[03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:45.240]  things not having to have a knee surgery because of it
[03:10:45.240 --> 03:10:49.480]  osteo fx i saw it with my mom as a triathlete my dad
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:53.000]  i lost 40 pounds then have gone back and forth because i still do a lot of
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:57.960]  unhealthy stuff just doing beyond tangy tangerine the polymers plus the things
[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:02.120]  at m4s health dot com i've been able to work harder longer
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:05.480]  i've never been a vitamin or mineral guy so i'm always going on and off of it my
[03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:08.600]  wife's like hey you've stopped you stopped taking the essential fatty acids
[03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:11.480]  you stopped people that don't stop and do it
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:14.360]  my dad i was at his house he's got a pool the other day and i was like
[03:11:14.360 --> 03:11:17.480]  look you're like 19 dad i'm like i'm a hippopotamus no actually
[03:11:17.480 --> 03:11:20.200]  when i'm wearing a swim trunks i don't have that big of a belly i actually
[03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:23.640]  exercise a lot i'm actually just more like you know a guerrilla or something
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:27.320]  a little bit stocky but but i think it goes hand in
[03:11:27.320 --> 03:11:30.280]  glove i think you should get your family in order
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:34.120]  your health in order exercise think about what's going on
[03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:38.360]  90% of your effort at first 10% and go into city council county commensures
[03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:41.640]  getting involved there's you know there's always room for all of it
[03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:44.360]  and i think once you start getting your health a little bit more in order and
[03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:48.120]  then you discover wow they always knew all this but never told me
[03:11:48.120 --> 03:11:50.760]  now it's your job to go out and warn other people
[03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:54.280]  and and and explain to them what you've discovered that hey you know they didn't
[03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:58.440]  tell me i need 90 minerals and vitamins and essential
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:02.760]  elements and things they only told me i need you know 20 or something
[03:12:02.760 --> 03:12:07.320]  so it's just incredible the type of knowledge uh in health that's out there
[03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:10.920]  so be just because i know it doesn't mean i've been putting it all
[03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:13.560]  into function gerald we were just talking about health
[03:12:13.560 --> 03:12:17.880]  before the break there we were talking about what big medicine offers i mean
[03:12:17.880 --> 03:12:20.680]  they have people everywhere with basically scurvy
[03:12:20.680 --> 03:12:23.640]  rod holes in their skin their teeth falling out because all they eat fast
[03:12:23.640 --> 03:12:26.920]  food with no real vitamin c and the doctors won't tell them hey you got
[03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:30.200]  scurvy they don't even teach doctors to look for scurvy
[03:12:30.200 --> 03:12:34.520]  you know the other one i would add into it is mental health in a sense that
[03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:38.120]  now i meditate every day i begin my day with meditation by the way you look
[03:12:38.120 --> 03:12:41.000]  you're in great shape well thank you for 25 yeah
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.800]  you know i i don't know if you know this i have an honorary doctorate in
[03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:47.880]  complementary medicine from the national university of health sciences
[03:12:47.880 --> 03:12:54.440]  and the first book i worked on 1986 was natural healing so i would suggest
[03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:57.720]  that before you do anything yes you get your body
[03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:00.760]  in order and you get your mind in order you know everybody has this movie going
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:03.240]  on in their head and when meditation does for me
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:07.880]  is tries to stop the movie so when you stop the movie then
[03:13:07.880 --> 03:13:11.880]  new thoughts can enter in it's like a reset exactly
[03:13:11.880 --> 03:13:15.480]  and and you really never is very hard to quiet your mind but that but the
[03:13:15.480 --> 03:13:20.040]  but in in meditation just the awareness that you're trying to quiet your mind
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:23.400]  and new thoughts are coming into when i swim part of the meditation about a
[03:13:23.400 --> 03:13:27.320]  half mile in i go into like a zen but i can't do it every
[03:13:27.320 --> 03:13:30.680]  time this morning i couldn't by then i got real mad at about a mile and a half
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:33.320]  because i was trying to get all the stuff out of my head i couldn't do it and
[03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:37.560]  that's why i begin my day meditation you know it's it so i would just suggest
[03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:40.840]  that it's the mind the body and the spirit
[03:13:40.840 --> 03:13:43.880]  absolutely but i was interrupting you know that's all that's that's it that's
[03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:48.360]  it that's on that number so so it's all of the equal parts
[03:13:48.360 --> 03:13:51.080]  yeah yeah because if you start you become the
[03:13:51.080 --> 03:13:55.400]  more of the activist because you're functioning at higher levels
[03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:59.640]  so you grow with me first get yourself in order exactly
[03:13:59.640 --> 03:14:02.840]  i mean you could dabble in like you said you know you dabble around the edges
[03:14:02.840 --> 03:14:06.200]  keep learning more about what's going on but you have to be in shape
[03:14:06.200 --> 03:14:09.160]  you know the better shape you're in the better the better fight you're going to
[03:14:09.160 --> 03:14:11.480]  win i have the problem though that when i really
[03:14:11.480 --> 03:14:14.920]  take all the vitamins and minerals and exercise like twice a day and eat healthy
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:19.880]  i get so crazed and my brain works so much the way the meditation comes in
[03:14:19.880 --> 03:14:23.160]  exactly how do you handle being really alive that's what i'm saying is that's
[03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:26.760]  where the that's why i begin my day with the meditation i'm as crazy as you are
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:30.280]  you know i never stop and but and that's why the meditation
[03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:34.360]  there's a book out by the way people ask me there's no
[03:14:34.360 --> 03:14:37.400]  i have a real good friend his name is alex mcmullen
[03:14:37.400 --> 03:14:42.840]  vietnam vet and through an accident not far from where i live
[03:14:42.840 --> 03:14:47.640]  he became a quadriplegic and this guy is a great guy
[03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:52.040]  he tells me all the time he said i can never make it if i didn't meditate
[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:55.480]  and remember this guy this guy's a man's man and now you know he's been in a
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:15:02.440]  wheelchair now for 20 something years and meditation what it does to you
[03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:07.000]  it again it helps you stop the movie and people say well how do you meditate the
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:10.600]  book i recommend is from thich nhat hanh
[03:15:10.600 --> 03:15:14.520]  he's a vietnamese buddhist but you could do anything you know whether you're
[03:15:14.520 --> 03:15:18.200]  breathing and counting one two three four yeah because a lot of the christians
[03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:21.320]  i'm a christian say stay away from that that's a cultic no
[03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:24.600]  it's just a way to clear your brain out that's all people made religions out of
[03:15:24.600 --> 03:15:26.920]  it exactly they got gurus and all the other stuff
[03:15:26.920 --> 03:15:30.840]  all the con artistry all it is is about trying to quiet your mind
[03:15:30.840 --> 03:15:35.480]  like you said you get all this energy all this stuff everybody has their movie
[03:15:35.480 --> 03:15:38.760]  and everybody thinks their movie is the only movie in the world
[03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:42.840]  the thing is to stop the movie when you stop the movie you have
[03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:46.360]  then new thought center in things that aren't important
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:51.160]  fade out and it really brings back a balance in your body as soon as i can
[03:15:51.160 --> 03:15:55.240]  get in that mode swimming or excuse me when i'm exercising or wake up
[03:15:55.240 --> 03:15:57.400]  middle of the night sit on the couch and think
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:00.680]  then i don't worry about fake enemies and people that make stuff up
[03:16:00.680 --> 03:16:03.880]  i actually want to try to like help them and wake them up it's
[03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:07.880]  but when i'm running the daily you know grind i get really mad
[03:16:07.880 --> 03:16:11.720]  yeah so again that's why i begin my day with meditation
[03:16:11.720 --> 03:16:14.280]  yeah so there's a really positive thing and i mean you know the bible talks
[03:16:14.280 --> 03:16:17.160]  about it just going to the still place exactly i've been doing this for
[03:16:17.160 --> 03:16:20.520]  years since the beginning of time again and then you'll like you point out
[03:16:20.520 --> 03:16:24.600]  then they make a religion out of it and people believe in his guru stuff
[03:16:24.600 --> 03:16:28.760]  yeah the guru is you that's that's it it ends with you begins with
[03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:31.960]  you know i get a kick out of these politicians always say oh you know
[03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:34.440]  they're gonna what legacy will they leave behind
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:37.800]  what legacy and nothing they what they find king richard the third under a
[03:16:37.800 --> 03:16:42.520]  parking lot yeah yeah i guess i was just to put it into perspective
[03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:46.600]  you know yes you know you don't count man once you're dead the only way you
[03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:49.400]  count is building new technology new info
[03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:53.000]  literature and that love goes forward that's and then you can
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.080]  commune with others even after you're gone
[03:16:55.080 --> 03:16:57.960]  they're going to see what you did and you're going to live on that's the way
[03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:00.760]  it is and and it's not an arrogant living on
[03:17:00.760 --> 03:17:03.720]  it's that you care about humanity want to communicate into the future and you
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:06.440]  want to do the best it can do while you're alive
[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:11.000]  you know i'm i'm a i was married a long time and divorced a long time i have no
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.640]  children everybody i love is essentially dead
[03:17:13.640 --> 03:17:17.720]  so i'm not hanging on to anything and for me only speaking for myself
[03:17:17.720 --> 03:17:21.240]  and you know the motto of the trends research is to think for yourself to me
[03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:25.160]  hell is taking that last breath and knowing
[03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:29.800]  that you weren't the person you said you were or could have been
[03:17:29.800 --> 03:17:33.400]  that's exactly what i think i just want to be real
[03:17:33.400 --> 03:17:38.520]  and i can't believe people hold on to their fakeness like it's a shield i know
[03:17:38.520 --> 03:17:42.120]  i know so i want to go to break come back with more calls with you gerald but
[03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:46.120]  but again they'll spin this that we're being anti a group or whatever
[03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:49.160]  but you eloquently summed up in about two minutes during a break of about an
[03:17:49.160 --> 03:17:53.800]  hour ago what is behind the 24 seven every show
[03:17:53.800 --> 03:17:59.960]  anti-male anti-family uh ramming you know dogs humping on women and in dog
[03:17:59.960 --> 03:18:04.280]  food commercials what is behind this is it that the elite are all
[03:18:04.280 --> 03:18:08.520]  whacked out and decadent i mean what is this about why are they at war with
[03:18:08.520 --> 03:18:11.480]  original males all right we'll talk about and get back
[03:18:11.480 --> 03:18:13.880]  no tell me now you want to take it okay we're going to break
[03:18:13.880 --> 03:18:18.600]  oh i understand okay the first thing is you know i love these courses that they
[03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:22.760]  have in school women's studies skip this break guys go ahead
[03:18:22.760 --> 03:18:26.840]  how about men's studies how about a course in men's studies
[03:18:26.840 --> 03:18:31.160]  can you imagine going forty thousand dollars in debt for women's studies
[03:18:31.160 --> 03:18:35.880]  number two they're making a big deal out of it as a as though it's positive
[03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:39.240]  that's some 41 percent of the households
[03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:45.480]  are now run by single women or and and another equal number about 41 percent
[03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:48.520]  of the of the the new births have come from
[03:18:48.520 --> 03:18:53.240]  uh unwed mothers as though it's a wonderful thing
[03:18:53.240 --> 03:19:01.000]  that families are just being run run by women and just speaking for myself
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:06.680]  i want the male energy i believe you know all of a sudden from the beginning
[03:19:06.680 --> 03:19:10.360]  at time there was men and women and children
[03:19:10.360 --> 03:19:13.800]  and now it's okay it's just perfectly fine
[03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:17.800]  to have one parent run the household listen with government bureaucrats
[03:19:17.800 --> 03:19:20.920]  with a limit and then and then and going on with this
[03:19:20.920 --> 03:19:25.080]  and then they complain that well the wages that women are getting are a lot
[03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:28.680]  lower okay now put this all together now you have 41
[03:19:28.680 --> 03:19:31.720]  percent of the households they're about to have single
[03:19:31.720 --> 03:19:35.800]  women running the households they're not making a lot of money
[03:19:35.800 --> 03:19:39.000]  what do you think this kid or children are going to grow up like
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:42.680]  and then you look at the real demographic in the real world the real world
[03:19:42.680 --> 03:19:45.960]  where i come from you know a guy that grew up in the Bronx and Yonkers you
[03:19:45.960 --> 03:19:49.960]  know and still dabbles in those areas you know we're looking at
[03:19:49.960 --> 03:19:54.200]  we're looking at 19 18 year old kids having kids
[03:19:54.200 --> 03:19:58.840]  that are out of their mind they came from families that were out of their mind
[03:19:58.840 --> 03:20:02.120]  their mothers whacked out on meth they don't know who their father is
[03:20:02.120 --> 03:20:06.200]  and they're finding some value in themselves by having children
[03:20:06.200 --> 03:20:12.920]  i just coming here to the show a person i was talking to his 25 year old son
[03:20:12.920 --> 03:20:18.840]  is now involved with a 19 year old girl from a crazy family she already has a
[03:20:18.840 --> 03:20:23.320]  kid now she's having another one and and now he's out of the picture
[03:20:23.320 --> 03:20:27.720]  what is this family going to grow up like look around what's happening
[03:20:27.720 --> 03:20:31.240]  look at the income levels look at the people having children
[03:20:31.240 --> 03:20:35.480]  and look what society is producing all i will say in defense of everything that
[03:20:35.480 --> 03:20:39.800]  i just said if it was working you think we'd be in the problems
[03:20:39.800 --> 03:20:43.400]  that we have now exactly your four times more likely
[03:20:43.400 --> 03:20:47.320]  ended up in prison or on drugs and to be in a low income
[03:20:47.320 --> 03:20:50.680]  wage if a father is not there when you're growing up and they say why are you
[03:20:50.680 --> 03:20:55.400]  attacking women no we're humans this is how we operate in women or
[03:20:55.400 --> 03:20:58.280]  women we do things differently oh here's the other thing
[03:20:58.280 --> 03:21:03.000]  every damn show out there the guy is lucky to be able to tie his shoes
[03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:06.440]  without the kid telling them how and by the way the the
[03:21:06.440 --> 03:21:09.480]  and that's the other part of this by the way with this whole thing
[03:21:09.480 --> 03:21:15.000]  that they all of a sudden the kid the particularly the parents the mother most
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:20.280]  most of the time all their kids are special and amazing
[03:21:20.280 --> 03:21:23.160]  a single guy go out with women have you oh i am like
[03:21:23.160 --> 03:21:27.000]  my my they're so she's they're so amazing they're so special
[03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:31.800]  their kids get over it their kids they're not special or amazing
[03:21:31.800 --> 03:21:35.960]  their little kids oh you've got to make them special and amazing you got to
[03:21:35.960 --> 03:21:39.560]  make yourself special and amazing what are they splitting the atom i mean
[03:21:39.560 --> 03:21:43.160]  who of us who grew up at 20 something years old knew what the hell we were
[03:21:43.160 --> 03:21:47.960]  doing well let's throw more at that they they have shows like the fosters now
[03:21:47.960 --> 03:21:51.160]  where they say men are bad they actually say
[03:21:51.160 --> 03:21:55.960]  it should be two women in the household so it's bigotry towards men
[03:21:55.960 --> 03:21:59.880]  and you see it in every show and the hitler said first you get the women
[03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:03.960]  then you got the children so follow the men they know that women make 80 percent
[03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:07.880]  of the advertising purchases you know the off advertising
[03:22:07.880 --> 03:22:12.680]  they're targeting women to break up the family to make the state the daddy and
[03:22:12.680 --> 03:22:16.760]  only the state can be masculine and you know why this country is going down
[03:22:16.760 --> 03:22:20.760]  because there are no men in it look at the people we gotta leave no no the
[03:22:20.760 --> 03:22:24.120]  criminals are all super hyper-aggressive men
[03:22:24.120 --> 03:22:28.200]  and they know they're dominating getting rid of the men so nobody opposes them
[03:22:28.200 --> 03:22:31.640]  there are no men look in the congress where's a man harry reid
[03:22:31.640 --> 03:22:37.400]  there's a man for you lindsey graham lindsey graham here there's a tough cat
[03:22:37.400 --> 03:22:40.680]  you'll keep going down the line boner boner what's his name
[03:22:40.680 --> 03:22:44.920]  i mean keep going look at obama look at obama
[03:22:44.920 --> 03:22:48.680]  look at bush look at all of it but getting into what's behind pushing the
[03:22:48.680 --> 03:22:52.520]  the the whole agenda on kids uh having the muppets come out and be gay
[03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:56.200]  what's behind that i don't know what's behind it but it's a whole decline
[03:22:56.200 --> 03:22:59.320]  and again the men happened in roe before it collapsed
[03:22:59.320 --> 03:23:03.720]  i didn't know that but i agree i probably did but again look at a look at tv
[03:23:03.720 --> 03:23:07.640]  the men are all stupid and and if you want to talk about discrimination
[03:23:07.640 --> 03:23:11.080]  how can there are no men's studies in all these schools
[03:23:11.080 --> 03:23:14.840]  why are there just women's studies oh here's my favorite
[03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:18.760]  if only the women were in control everything would be great
[03:23:18.760 --> 03:23:22.280]  hey you know who started the illibyan war you know the three witches and
[03:23:22.280 --> 03:23:25.400]  mcbeth behind it try hitlery clinton
[03:23:25.400 --> 03:23:32.520]  samantha powers and susan rice yeah oh and those lovely other sweet little
[03:23:32.520 --> 03:23:36.120]  those little little fine little ladies like margaret thatchin
[03:23:36.120 --> 03:23:39.320]  dear agandhi who's the lunatic they just threw out of a
[03:23:39.320 --> 03:23:43.160]  australia over there galard and they put another lunatic in rudd
[03:23:43.160 --> 03:23:47.640]  but women it's not a gender issue it's a morality issue
[03:23:47.640 --> 03:23:51.000]  well look they've made they've turned it into a gender i agree but we are
[03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:55.160]  scientifically being attacked so that because they know
[03:23:55.160 --> 03:23:58.280]  families will stand up for each other and that's why
[03:23:58.280 --> 03:24:01.960]  they're trying to get rid of the nuclear family and bad mouth it
[03:24:01.960 --> 03:24:06.280]  austin is so trendy that we have three children my wife has had women come over
[03:24:06.280 --> 03:24:10.600]  and tell her you got too many kids i mean that's how weird these people are
[03:24:10.600 --> 03:24:13.800]  yeah what would you say if somebody came up to you and got in your face
[03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:18.280]  it's a manual business get the hell out of here that's what i'd say it's
[03:24:18.280 --> 03:24:21.800]  incredible out of your mind but what do you but how do that
[03:24:21.800 --> 03:24:25.880]  the other rest of the world is not committing suicide and not you know
[03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:29.480]  again by the look what condition we're in
[03:24:29.480 --> 03:24:33.000]  if it was working so well we'd be in much better shape
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:36.280]  if we have an educational system that was worth anything
[03:24:36.280 --> 03:24:40.760]  be it higher education or or k-12 you think the nation
[03:24:40.760 --> 03:24:44.680]  would be in the problems but let me throw this out there men buy into this
[03:24:44.680 --> 03:24:48.600]  message they should be lazy and stupid and and do what their wife tells them
[03:24:48.600 --> 03:24:52.600]  i mean i know a lot of men that literally just love this
[03:24:52.600 --> 03:24:56.200]  i tell you it's pathetic and then they think i'm bad because i don't want to be
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:25:00.120]  a slave well the same thing with me you know they'll you'll sell a macho you
[03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:03.640]  know a macho you're feminist i'm a macho so what yeah but the
[03:25:03.640 --> 03:25:07.400]  difference is the difference is is that those women
[03:25:07.400 --> 03:25:10.520]  after they always figure out what they actually want is a real man
[03:25:10.520 --> 03:25:13.640]  the point is well these women don't want some guy falling like a baby elephant
[03:25:13.640 --> 03:25:16.360]  behind them i mean that is not what they're looking for
[03:25:16.360 --> 03:25:21.080]  what do they have again look look at the leaders
[03:25:21.080 --> 03:25:23.800]  and again look around the world what do you got what do you have over there in
[03:25:23.800 --> 03:25:26.520]  england camera and i mean that come on
[03:25:26.520 --> 03:25:30.280]  there's a little boy but we got over there and in in in the
[03:25:30.280 --> 03:25:35.160]  in in france halan sarcozy i mean these guys aren't guys
[03:25:35.160 --> 03:25:39.560]  they're you know to me the the last real man in the white house was
[03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:45.640]  was was eisenhower well it is true that i mean where are the manly leaders
[03:25:45.640 --> 03:25:49.160]  that really just want to build a good society for people yeah it's not a
[03:25:49.160 --> 03:25:53.000]  question about control it's a question about men do it men do
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:57.400]  women do it women do and at one time look
[03:25:57.400 --> 03:26:03.240]  look what's going on look at the look at the income gap in this country
[03:26:03.240 --> 03:26:06.920]  not only between women and men between all of us
[03:26:06.920 --> 03:26:11.000]  and them the one percent well they've done studies women are actually paid
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:14.600]  more than men on average if you take the fact that they get pregnant they want
[03:26:14.600 --> 03:26:17.480]  time off they do that which is fine i mean and then the
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:21.240]  feminist said it's not good to raise your children
[03:26:21.240 --> 03:26:24.760]  let the state do it as if it's a bad decision
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:27.640]  like like like my mother had several degrees had been in business been in
[03:26:27.640 --> 03:26:30.600]  newspapers when she had me and then my sister later
[03:26:30.600 --> 03:26:34.440]  she decided to be a homemaker and that was important and she would have women
[03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:37.720]  in dallas say you ought to be working it's pathetic
[03:26:37.720 --> 03:26:42.520]  that you're at home and she's like what do you mean i like this yeah check it out
[03:26:42.520 --> 03:26:47.160]  you're you're a little kid you're born and all of a sudden six weeks old
[03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:52.440]  you have a stranger taking care of you that's making no money at all
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:57.720]  they're hardly paid anything i mean i if my mother may or so rest in
[03:26:57.720 --> 03:27:01.000]  peace wasn't home i would be a lunatic i'd be
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:05.800]  really out of my mind by now i mean you know the times how dare your mother
[03:27:05.800 --> 03:27:10.040]  and and and other family raise you that is evil i mean all the trouble i used
[03:27:10.040 --> 03:27:12.520]  to get it well imagine breastfeeding yeah where the
[03:27:12.520 --> 03:27:16.280]  brain's actually developed you know when they do this formula that's designed
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:19.320]  like seventy seven percent sugar when it's supposed to be like 20 30 percent
[03:27:19.320 --> 03:27:23.000]  and it's it's five fructose corn syrup full of chemicals the brains are about
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:27.800]  a third smaller the cc size they don't fill the skull cavity
[03:27:27.800 --> 03:27:31.800]  i mean think what we do to our kids so the women can go to work immediately i
[03:27:31.800 --> 03:27:36.040]  know again a little infant comes out and now
[03:27:36.040 --> 03:27:39.640]  who's taking care of that kid i mean a stranger
[03:27:39.640 --> 03:27:43.800]  i mean to me and again you could write all the hate mail you want i don't care
[03:27:43.800 --> 03:27:47.720]  anybody you want to tell me i'm i'm not i'm not you know
[03:27:47.720 --> 03:27:51.960]  a misogynist it's a lot of crap no no no you shove the kids in there
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:56.680]  yeah from some stranger with a kid in the old days from the beginning of
[03:27:56.680 --> 03:28:01.320]  civilization the mother would be with the child that's a conspiracy theory
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:04.520]  women never brush they would never work with the child no no next they're gonna
[03:28:04.520 --> 03:28:09.080]  say that the women's breaster are there to be injected full of
[03:28:09.080 --> 03:28:13.720]  you know uh uh this phenol a and she's there to get code they're there to get
[03:28:13.720 --> 03:28:16.680]  cancer it's silicone that's what they're there for
[03:28:16.680 --> 03:28:20.760]  there would be more silicone into it you didn't know babies drink silicone
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:24.440]  but really i mean all of us think about hey chicken mcduckett's have silicone
[03:28:24.440 --> 03:28:28.680]  and why not think of what they're doing to the kids they're raising children
[03:28:28.680 --> 03:28:33.880]  and their strangers have their kids i mean my god you know i mean i i could
[03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:37.080]  not imagine no that's the state taking over and it's getting
[03:28:37.080 --> 03:28:41.160]  you used to it and look at the people that they have taken care of them
[03:28:41.160 --> 03:28:44.760]  you know they're low paid people i'm sure they're well intentioned you know
[03:28:44.760 --> 03:28:48.520]  the cps really wants is good families with good healthy kids because they
[03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:51.640]  can sell them to the adoption rackets and the average person getting a kid
[03:28:51.640 --> 03:28:53.480]  adopted doesn't even know where they came from
[03:28:53.480 --> 03:28:56.440]  a lot of times they're like oh this is a healthy little baby yeah it was stolen
[03:28:56.440 --> 03:28:59.800]  from somebody for no reason but if they're putting cigarettes out on kids
[03:28:59.800 --> 03:29:02.360]  and beating them and it's a five pound you know
[03:29:02.360 --> 03:29:06.120]  year old baby they have cases of that starving of death with flies all over
[03:29:06.120 --> 03:29:09.080]  them cps will look in the crib it won't help them because they don't want the
[03:29:09.080 --> 03:29:13.080]  baby covered with flies they want your healthy baby
[03:29:13.080 --> 03:29:18.680]  how sick is that pretty sick you know what maybe we're wrong maybe the

[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:03.720]  overboard that's how tyranny's always work in history
[03:34:03.720 --> 03:34:07.400]  this is what happens when societies decline
[03:34:07.400 --> 03:34:11.800]  and it's it's it's it's as old as history when societies are thriving and
[03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:14.680]  doing well they're not breaking down on you topo
[03:34:14.680 --> 03:34:19.320]  topo chico right yeah the only one i knew was topo g joe
[03:34:19.320 --> 03:34:23.080]  that was that that was the guy on the ed Sullivan show with the
[03:34:23.080 --> 03:34:29.080]  with the little hand puppet topo g joe but anyway i like topo chico that's
[03:34:29.080 --> 03:34:32.440]  really nice stop it they're not a sponsor they should be
[03:34:32.440 --> 03:34:36.840]  thousands of dollars of plugs but anyway no it's um
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:39.880]  this is what happens when societies break down
[03:34:39.880 --> 03:34:42.680]  the more they break down the tougher they get
[03:34:42.680 --> 03:34:46.120]  cracked down on the people it's as old as history
[03:34:46.120 --> 03:34:49.160]  and that's what you're seeing and then that breaks down things more and they
[03:34:49.160 --> 03:34:51.960]  got to crack down more that's why we have to return it
[03:34:51.960 --> 03:34:54.760]  and you were talking about the ways to return it
[03:34:54.760 --> 03:35:01.160]  number one bring home the troops no foreign entanglements
[03:35:01.160 --> 03:35:04.440]  number two that's George Washington we can't listen to him that's right yeah
[03:35:04.440 --> 03:35:08.280]  he was a real commander-in-chief right led from the front yeah i love how the
[03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:11.880]  commander-in-chief yet commander-in-chief these guys kidding you
[03:35:11.880 --> 03:35:15.640]  know and the other ones the the other ones that i believe in
[03:35:15.640 --> 03:35:19.160]  are um have to put back the laws in place
[03:35:19.160 --> 03:35:22.600]  that they put in place so these things wouldn't happen and one of them of
[03:35:22.600 --> 03:35:26.520]  course is the glass steagle act and as you well know today we're talking
[03:35:26.520 --> 03:35:29.960]  about c-span they're talking about banking regulations you know
[03:35:29.960 --> 03:35:33.800]  it's the regulation is there it was dismantled by
[03:35:33.800 --> 03:35:37.800]  slick willy clinton and robert rubin who was the former head
[03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:41.960]  of the gulman sacks gang and of course they created
[03:35:41.960 --> 03:35:46.360]  from that big companies country companies like
[03:35:46.360 --> 03:35:51.960]  um who are they mfglobal the mfglobal they're taking
[03:35:51.960 --> 03:35:54.600]  core signs oh by yeah what do you think now a couple years
[03:35:54.600 --> 03:35:58.200]  after they stole your money you may go to jail oh yeah he may go nowhere
[03:35:58.200 --> 03:36:01.080]  i'll bet on i'll bet anything yeah they're saying it'll be there'll be a
[03:36:01.080 --> 03:36:04.760]  lawsuit yeah yeah he'll get near he'll walk away
[03:36:04.760 --> 03:36:08.600]  nothing will happen to him but they i remember they city group first it was
[03:36:08.600 --> 03:36:12.440]  city bank then became city group and then became they bought travelers and
[03:36:12.440 --> 03:36:16.120]  then smith barny and that guy sandy wild oh everybody
[03:36:16.120 --> 03:36:18.440]  loved him this is when they dismantled the glass
[03:36:18.440 --> 03:36:22.520]  steagle act oh and robert rubin later went to work for sandy
[03:36:22.520 --> 03:36:27.080]  i think he made like a hundred and ten million dollars in consulting fees
[03:36:27.080 --> 03:36:31.240]  so we need to put back the laws that were put in place before
[03:36:31.240 --> 03:36:35.720]  that prohibited the gangsters from robbing all our money
[03:36:35.720 --> 03:36:41.880]  and turning america into slave landia look you were talking about buying local
[03:36:41.880 --> 03:36:46.520]  when i was a kid they had this funny thing they were called stationary stores
[03:36:46.520 --> 03:36:51.480]  before there was staples and home well the office depot
[03:36:51.480 --> 03:36:55.800]  they had another little quaint thing called pharmacies that's right the local
[03:36:55.800 --> 03:36:59.560]  people who stole their own pharmacies and now they work for cv and they had a
[03:36:59.560 --> 03:37:01.960]  big selection and they'd even make you a hamburger
[03:37:01.960 --> 03:37:04.840]  that's right yeah and soda fountains and then you could get a job there when
[03:37:04.840 --> 03:37:08.840]  you were a kid yeah and i did i was a so i was one of the
[03:37:08.840 --> 03:37:10.920]  last so you could have just gotten a
[03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:14.280]  give it a bunch of vaccines and died of a embolism that'd have been more fun i
[03:37:14.280 --> 03:37:18.200]  was one of the last soda jerks i was that when i was my favorite job all
[03:37:18.200 --> 03:37:21.080]  the kids used to come in after school you know
[03:37:21.080 --> 03:37:26.200]  and it was fun and that's why i've been a nice pretty girl too but anyway i digress
[03:37:26.200 --> 03:37:30.040]  i can imagine you're like hey baby oh no she oh she was a sweetheart
[03:37:30.040 --> 03:37:35.080]  anyway and then and then you had other little things butcher shops
[03:37:35.080 --> 03:37:37.960]  and grocery stores and you learned who had the better meat and who had to cut
[03:37:37.960 --> 03:37:40.200]  you like exactly and in dress shops and
[03:37:40.200 --> 03:37:43.720]  haberdasher's and now we have walmarts and targets
[03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:47.400]  it's one takeover and here's the thing the young people have no point of
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:37:49.960]  reference they think it was always like this and they
[03:37:49.960 --> 03:37:53.320]  always think walmarts like a prison where they search you and stuff too
[03:37:53.320 --> 03:37:57.160]  when you come in and out i mean i i guess the old clothing stores you didn't
[03:37:57.160 --> 03:38:00.120]  get to get searched and you didn't get searched and you weren't walking into a
[03:38:00.120 --> 03:38:03.400]  place that looked like a large self storage unit
[03:38:03.400 --> 03:38:07.880]  you know they had every these places had style and class and grace to them
[03:38:07.880 --> 03:38:10.840]  i know you look at all i look at old photos of family and stuff grandparents
[03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:14.760]  great grandparents they all look so sharp and awake and dress so nice
[03:38:14.760 --> 03:38:17.960]  and i was like why do they look so good again well they weren't eating gmo
[03:38:17.960 --> 03:38:21.160]  they weren't eating gmo and they weren't working for the
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:25.240]  for the men in slave landia and i'll tell you this and if a cop was rude and
[03:38:25.240 --> 03:38:28.040]  got in their face there'd be trouble
[03:38:28.040 --> 03:38:31.800]  people think laying down have you seen the video in new jersey of the disarmed
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:34.920]  lady she doesn't have a gun and the guy comes in and beats her for like five
[03:38:34.920 --> 03:38:38.200]  minutes and right in front of her kid nobody's guys can you cue that up to
[03:38:38.200 --> 03:38:40.520]  show gerald i'm going to your calls i promise
[03:38:40.520 --> 03:38:44.120]  cue that up in a minute i want to show but but my point is this is obama gun
[03:38:44.120 --> 03:38:46.200]  control i mean this is the great role of the
[03:38:46.200 --> 03:38:49.480]  government the criminals have the guns and we're sandwiched between authoritarian
[03:38:49.480 --> 03:38:53.320]  government and street thugs there it is and looked a little kid
[03:38:53.320 --> 03:38:56.440]  cowering in fear she this woman didn't even resist him
[03:38:56.440 --> 03:38:59.240]  and he just beats her and beats her and beats her and throws her down the
[03:38:59.240 --> 03:39:03.240]  stair god and it just ain't but hey
[03:39:03.240 --> 03:39:05.800]  i think that lady might need to go to jail for a hate crime he might have hurt
[03:39:05.800 --> 03:39:10.600]  his fist oh my god where where is the white
[03:39:10.600 --> 03:39:14.200]  jessie jackson declaring this racial hate crime again i'm not
[03:39:14.200 --> 03:39:18.440]  saying it oh my god race thing my point is is that listen you know i
[03:39:18.440 --> 03:39:22.760]  i hey why don't the feminists call for her to be armed
[03:39:22.760 --> 03:39:27.240]  oh i learned how to fight too yeah oh let me tell you something my mom my
[03:39:27.240 --> 03:39:29.880]  wife you try that there's gonna be butchered night yeah what would happen

[03:39:33.800 --> 03:39:36.680]  no way and if we were there were one of the kids over there
[03:39:36.680 --> 03:39:39.480]  we'd be banging this guy over there with a vase or anything we could pick up
[03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:42.440]  i agree yeah i was mean when i was a little kid yeah
[03:39:42.440 --> 03:39:47.080]  what happened to people again it's it's it's the uh
[03:39:47.080 --> 03:39:51.480]  like i was a meaner when i was i'm a sweet too but i was mean when i was a kid
[03:39:51.480 --> 03:39:53.880]  and when i was like 14 i probably meaner than i am now
[03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:57.240]  what happened to kids i don't understand this thing it was like i mean i want to
[03:39:57.240 --> 03:39:59.560]  not start in fights but if you punch me you want to get to fight you're gonna
[03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:02.520]  get one i don't understand this just cowering thing
[03:40:02.520 --> 03:40:05.320]  what would your mom have done my mother i know what she'd do
[03:40:05.320 --> 03:40:08.280]  because my dad's tried to tickle her before and she hit him upside the head
[03:40:08.280 --> 03:40:11.560]  with a boot just knocked him out uh i mean and she's not looking for trouble
[03:40:11.560 --> 03:40:13.960]  who are these women you can just beat up so easy
[03:40:13.960 --> 03:40:17.080]  well it's not only the women it's the men too yeah hard women kick there was
[03:40:17.080 --> 03:40:20.200]  another one out there a guy i saw one that they had a guy
[03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:24.840]  a fight on the two guys in um in suits or
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:28.040]  yeah because they got in a fight somewhere and it was like two little
[03:40:28.040 --> 03:40:31.960]  those little kids fighting these weren't men fighting there was another clip i
[03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:35.240]  saw it on cnn they probably picked that one up too
[03:40:35.240 --> 03:40:40.120]  but but so what happened is we were not taught to fight back
[03:40:40.120 --> 03:40:43.720]  you're not taught to fight back yeah in the schools you you get more trouble
[03:40:43.720 --> 03:40:48.840]  if you fight back than if you start a fight listen i got expelled a couple of
[03:40:48.840 --> 03:40:52.120]  times for getting a fight i was a little kid i was the smallest one there so he
[03:40:52.120 --> 03:40:55.400]  used to pick on me yeah and one time i bit off a piece of the
[03:40:55.400 --> 03:40:59.960]  kid's cheek good yeah he started it the other kid
[03:40:59.960 --> 03:41:03.880]  and one time i was at the bottom of a dog pile they were stomping me
[03:41:03.880 --> 03:41:07.160]  and the guy's leg was right there and there was an arm i just reached over
[03:41:07.160 --> 03:41:11.400]  chomp chomp they got off me real quick yeah that's what he got teeth for
[03:41:11.400 --> 03:41:15.320]  yeah the same thing i got in fights i'm more than one but i was a little guy
[03:41:15.320 --> 03:41:19.720]  had to learn how to defend myself and as you may know i have a second
[03:41:19.720 --> 03:41:23.080]  degree black belt in close combat so i never stopped
[03:41:23.080 --> 03:41:27.560]  and i used to train women by the way that were victims of abuse and rape
[03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:29.800]  yeah what would you do if a guy tried something like that you kick him right
[03:41:29.800 --> 03:41:33.800]  in the wavos right well no with me i just go for the computer
[03:41:33.800 --> 03:41:37.560]  you know you head yeah you go for the eyes and the nose you push that nose
[03:41:37.560 --> 03:41:40.840]  that just give him a palm heel to the nose and push that little bone through
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:43.480]  the brain yeah well the fingers through the eyes and
[03:41:43.480 --> 03:41:46.840]  there's this little shield behind there that once you get hit penetrate that they
[03:41:46.840 --> 03:41:49.720]  go on blotto and and the other one is if in
[03:41:49.720 --> 03:41:53.400]  particulars with women you know if they were in a situation
[03:41:53.400 --> 03:41:57.480]  a rape situation is to just bite into that you know
[03:41:57.480 --> 03:42:01.720]  soften the guy up tell him how much you love him out what a man he is and
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:06.120]  seduce him in closer and just bite into that carotid artery and twist it as
[03:42:06.120 --> 03:42:09.080]  you bite it and well just the classic thing i've seen is
[03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:13.640]  if close your eyes is a lot of times a woman will go back through the through the and if a guy tries
[03:42:13.640 --> 03:42:17.560]  to climb on them and women just kick them like a mule well the thing is with kicking
[03:42:17.560 --> 03:42:21.480]  i've seen i've seen a number of fights no but i've just seen men try to climb on
[03:42:21.480 --> 03:42:24.440]  women and seen them kick them off oh yeah but i'm just saying if it comes to
[03:42:24.440 --> 03:42:28.280]  that kind of a situation you know what are a lot of things going on
[03:42:28.280 --> 03:42:31.800]  you know that woman didn't even resist she didn't even i guarantee when i was a
[03:42:31.800 --> 03:42:35.560]  kid and i don't care how big the guy was if i was there my mother would be like
[03:42:35.560 --> 03:42:38.600]  i mean it'd be bad you see the thing with the fight too is that people don't
[03:42:38.600 --> 03:42:41.960]  understand is that it's not like you're seeing the movies you know it's not all
[03:42:41.960 --> 03:42:45.640]  this posturing and thing it doesn't go on and on and on no the first guy in
[03:42:45.640 --> 03:42:49.640]  usually wins and that's what i do that's what i teach you go right in you feel
[03:42:49.640 --> 03:42:53.240]  trouble coming down you go right in you're all over it and again you know
[03:42:53.240 --> 03:42:56.840]  that it's the it's the palmiel matter of fact i should have my teacher on
[03:42:56.840 --> 03:43:01.800]  john perkins from attackproof.com anybody could go to attackproof.com
[03:43:01.800 --> 03:43:04.920]  and this guy you know i mean he's these are real guys you know he was a cop and
[03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:09.960]  you know tortle you know it's been there and uh we people don't understand is
[03:43:09.960 --> 03:43:13.640]  you got to go right in and you go in and you do what you have to do and the
[03:43:13.640 --> 03:43:17.960]  fight ends really well i agree instinctively if you punch somebody
[03:43:17.960 --> 03:43:21.640]  with an uppercut in the nose i never sent one into the brain but i've torn the
[03:43:21.640 --> 03:43:25.880]  nose off completely like twice they're out of the fight yeah well palmiel is
[03:43:25.880 --> 03:43:29.240]  nicer it's just right right to the nose you don't hurt you you don't hurt your
[03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:32.840]  wrist and it does the job but that's you're gonna kill somebody just so you
[03:43:32.840 --> 03:43:37.080]  know and with me i avoid fights at this point because
[03:43:37.080 --> 03:43:40.440]  and i've been in situations and the guys will tell you up there
[03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:43.560]  and i make it really clear that if this thing is going to get out of hand
[03:43:43.560 --> 03:43:47.880]  somebody's going to really be hurt and it's not going to be me no i'm not
[03:43:47.880 --> 03:43:50.200]  looking for violence but if somebody starts one with me
[03:43:50.200 --> 03:43:53.240]  i'm just going to punch him on the throat as fast as i can yeah i've also
[03:43:53.240 --> 03:43:56.680]  found that's useful punch the throat is good but again if you
[03:43:56.680 --> 03:44:00.280]  want to put take the person out you want to if it's the end it's an end game
[03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:04.200]  and your life is threatened the two things are the note the palm
[03:44:04.200 --> 03:44:08.200]  heal to the nose and and an eye strikes you know
[03:44:08.200 --> 03:44:11.960]  right through the eyes there's a little shield once you go by that boom your
[03:44:11.960 --> 03:44:16.360]  brain goes out it's over so those are the two and i again i'm a small guy i
[03:44:16.360 --> 03:44:21.240]  only go for the computer yeah yeah unfortunately i've
[03:44:21.240 --> 03:44:24.680]  been fighting a long time i'm glad i've gone for computers before yeah
[03:44:24.680 --> 03:44:29.160]  those it didn't turn out nice i tell you uh luckily i got a thick skull so it's
[03:44:29.160 --> 03:44:33.080]  been it's been good life for me ha ha ha now i fight in the info war
[03:44:33.080 --> 03:44:35.800]  gerald but but i just can't believe videos like this
[03:44:35.800 --> 03:44:39.080]  right but again they're teaching us not to fight
[03:44:39.080 --> 03:44:42.600]  they're teaching if you're in we have a problem call the police they're teaching
[03:44:42.600 --> 03:44:46.680]  you not to be strong and that's what they've done to society at every level
[03:44:46.680 --> 03:44:50.120]  and then we by the way we could go back to the feminine thing again
[03:44:50.120 --> 03:44:54.360]  a house being raised again with a male energy it's different
[03:44:54.360 --> 03:44:58.920]  you have a different way about you and and young people are losing the male
[03:44:58.920 --> 03:45:04.360]  energy and they're making it seem as though it's a bad thing to have
[03:45:04.360 --> 03:45:07.400]  you know i hear it you know that that's my point i'm tired of hearing i'm bad
[03:45:07.400 --> 03:45:10.920]  because i'm a man exactly and that male energy is a negative
[03:45:10.920 --> 03:45:14.680]  thing like if you go to schools or you know in public
[03:45:14.680 --> 03:45:18.760]  schools government things they talk to the woman not the man
[03:45:18.760 --> 03:45:21.640]  and it's like hey men don't speak here even if it's a man it's like women run
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:24.760]  things now and they're running things pretty well aren't they
[03:45:24.760 --> 03:45:31.240]  dog but i mean the guys the guys need to step up
[03:45:31.240 --> 03:45:35.480]  and leads what needs to happen and both you know again let's just call it equal
[03:45:35.480 --> 03:45:39.080]  everybody's together yeah let's call it equal but i mean historically it's
[03:45:39.080 --> 03:45:42.120]  going to be men like george washington he had women behind him supporting him
[03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:44.680]  and you know big time they couldn't know without the women supporting them and
[03:45:44.680 --> 03:45:48.120]  all things they did but it was men that you know well you know we could have a
[03:45:48.120 --> 03:45:51.320]  woman leading leading the second american revolution if she was a
[03:45:51.320 --> 03:45:54.840]  patriot exactly if it was about making it for the
[03:45:54.840 --> 03:45:58.920]  for the greater good oh i agree i well woman leading the
[03:45:58.920 --> 03:46:02.120]  second american i get behind a woman that was a leader
[03:46:02.120 --> 03:46:05.160]  yeah in a second if it wasn't about sand men are bad all day
[03:46:05.160 --> 03:46:08.520]  yeah again we're talking about the bigger issue the american revolution
[03:46:08.520 --> 03:46:11.800]  exactly it's not a vulcanization issue i'm saying they're trying to get women
[03:46:11.800 --> 03:46:15.400]  to gang up on men when instead i mean women you're going to have boys as
[03:46:15.400 --> 03:46:19.400]  well as girls i want my boys and girls to be empowered
[03:46:19.400 --> 03:46:22.120]  we're having quite the talk with gel salante in person today we got to go
[03:46:22.120 --> 03:46:25.480]  film here in a minute for your obama deception too but we're live right now
[03:46:25.480 --> 03:46:29.720]  alcatraz thanks for holding her on the air with gel salante
[03:46:29.720 --> 03:46:34.600]  uh yes alex are you there yes sir all right well
[03:46:34.600 --> 03:46:39.720]  i just want to ask you a question have you heard about the uh cyber attack drill
[03:46:39.720 --> 03:46:44.520]  being hosted by the department of homeland security called quantum don too
[03:46:44.520 --> 03:46:50.920]  uh yes it rings the bell uh yeah well i just uh want to inform you this you
[03:46:50.920 --> 03:46:55.080]  know how the dhs they love to put their false flag attacks right next to the
[03:46:55.080 --> 03:46:59.320]  drill well i don't know if this is true or not
[03:46:59.320 --> 03:47:02.600]  all right and i'm not going to say that it is going to happen but
[03:47:02.600 --> 03:47:07.000]  um i believe that this is going to be the next false flag attack what's your
[03:47:07.000 --> 03:47:10.040]  take on this i don't know they could use any drill as
[03:47:10.040 --> 03:47:13.480]  the smoke screen to do it but i mean we know like they launched the stock stand
[03:47:13.480 --> 03:47:16.200]  attack and then said they need to take over the internet
[03:47:16.200 --> 03:47:19.560]  uh because of the stock stand attack and the media didn't point out the cia in
[03:47:19.560 --> 03:47:23.160]  israel created it with microsoft and sent it out there reportedly
[03:47:23.160 --> 03:47:26.120]  that's how dumb they think they're gonna take your rights because of al-qaeda but
[03:47:26.120 --> 03:47:30.120]  then they run al-qaeda uh jerald well you know that on the on the on the false
[03:47:30.120 --> 03:47:33.960]  flag i believe that we are going to have either a false
[03:47:33.960 --> 03:47:39.880]  flag or a real flag something that is going to divert our attention away
[03:47:39.880 --> 03:47:45.000]  from the problems that are around us now there's going to be a wag the dog moment
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:48.840]  and it's also going to wag us away from the economic problems they're not going
[03:47:48.840 --> 03:47:51.320]  to be able to get us out of this economic mess
[03:47:51.320 --> 03:47:55.320]  as we all know again the stimulus did not work now they're talking about tapering
[03:47:55.320 --> 03:47:58.120]  it back i mentioned to you what that interest rates
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:02.200]  up went up the first the fastest time in 26 years in a week
[03:48:02.200 --> 03:48:06.920]  and so i think there might be a false flag it might be a computer it might be
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:12.120]  a quote terrorism it might be something going on with syria
[03:48:12.120 --> 03:48:15.160]  and then they say we got hit because of snowden
[03:48:15.160 --> 03:48:18.760]  everybody's like please spy on me like right do you think you got it miss us
[03:48:18.760 --> 03:48:21.320]  a going or one of the contestants i want to be
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:24.920]  spied on watch everything i do keep me safe in case i'm bad
[03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:29.320]  there you go keep me safe and that's why that woman couldn't fight
[03:48:29.320 --> 03:48:32.600]  and that's why the little kid was cowering that should be
[03:48:32.600 --> 03:48:37.880]  natural instinct to protect yourself you shouldn't be taught how to do it
[03:48:37.880 --> 03:48:44.120]  it should be now a dna that's that that is the opposite of everything also why
[03:48:44.120 --> 03:48:47.160]  does the guy just keep beating the daylights out because he's at
[03:48:47.160 --> 03:48:51.720]  what kind of drugs is this guy whacked out on well what's his brain and what
[03:48:51.720 --> 03:48:55.720]  zone i mean of course this guy's out of his mind
[03:48:55.720 --> 03:48:58.760]  and by the way that's my biggest fear and this is what we're going to be writing
[03:48:58.760 --> 03:49:02.440]  about this in the next trans journal all of these this youth unemployment
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:06.680]  you're talking 60 percent around the world they're gonna make them cops
[03:49:06.680 --> 03:49:10.920]  they're gonna they're out of their minds already there are all kinds of drugs
[03:49:10.920 --> 03:49:13.720]  that whether it's you know the psychotropic drugs
[03:49:13.720 --> 03:49:19.000]  whether it's uh the uh the opiates whether people are screwed up i know
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:22.360]  big numbers you know i go out a lot you know i'm out in the street i go to
[03:49:22.360 --> 03:49:25.640]  different places i bounce around i see it man
[03:49:25.640 --> 03:49:31.400]  the we have a we have a drug problem and now it's not marijuana cocaine and
[03:49:31.400 --> 03:49:34.440]  much worse than that marijuana i mean really
[03:49:34.440 --> 03:49:37.560]  but it's so most of them are on prescriptions now and they're saying
[03:49:37.560 --> 03:49:40.120]  like and then they'll give them whatever they want
[03:49:40.120 --> 03:49:43.880]  i know and i'm saying this is going to be one of the biggest problems confronting
[03:49:43.880 --> 03:49:46.680]  of us so when you're asking about that guy out of his
[03:49:46.680 --> 03:49:49.160]  mind they're going to be a lot more like him
[03:49:49.160 --> 03:49:53.080]  there are a lot of young people that they have degrees in worthlessness
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:57.320]  and are facing a hopeless future if they have any kind of education and then like
[03:49:57.320 --> 03:50:02.120]  why in chicago and places do they want the public disarms so criminals all
[03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:06.200]  move their feet on them why in new jersey do people not get not
[03:50:06.200 --> 03:50:08.600]  everybody in new jersey but that you know they've taken the guns that happened
[03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:12.920]  that woman why do they want to live under bloomberg who has 15 bodyguards with
[03:50:12.920 --> 03:50:17.080]  guns but says you can't have one again people have lost their dignity their
[03:50:17.080 --> 03:50:21.080]  courage and their self-respect and they're listening to other people
[03:50:21.080 --> 03:50:24.840]  on telling them how to run their lives that's why
[03:50:24.840 --> 03:50:28.280]  and that's all it comes back down to bloomberg is a pig
[03:50:28.280 --> 03:50:32.200]  but i can't stand them and we would he'd be nobody if he didn't have his money
[03:50:32.200 --> 03:50:35.240]  to make him and he lied brilliant he said he wouldn't
[03:50:35.240 --> 03:50:38.360]  run for another term and change the law yeah he bought the he bought the
[03:50:38.360 --> 03:50:41.880]  he bought the election and now look how bad it is look at the people running

[03:50:45.320 --> 03:50:48.600]  is leading that guy the guy who put up his thing on
[03:50:48.600 --> 03:50:52.680]  on facebook he's thrusting his weiner yeah and he's in there he's leading

[03:54:27.960 --> 03:54:33.000]  briefly what's coming up in the new trends journal oh we're going to be
[03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:38.520]  doing a special report on the economic future where is it going what to expect
[03:54:38.520 --> 03:54:42.600]  and what to do that's going to be the and a nutshell what is it in your view
[03:54:42.600 --> 03:54:47.000]  the nutshell is that to hold on for a while and then we're going to go into a
[03:54:47.000 --> 03:54:52.520]  real serious decline and it's not only again in the united states as i mentioned
[03:54:52.520 --> 03:54:55.080]  what's going on in and that's why they're gearing up with all the martial
[03:54:55.080 --> 03:54:59.640]  law get i believe so 100 percent and again it's not
[03:54:59.640 --> 03:55:05.080]  only in the u.s. and i was mentioning before we didn't follow up on it
[03:55:05.080 --> 03:55:09.080]  before that one of the breaks in china what they're what they're concerned
[03:55:09.080 --> 03:55:12.760]  about the most is not the united states like seven thousand riots a month or
[03:55:12.760 --> 03:55:15.560]  something yeah they have 1.2 billion people and
[03:55:15.560 --> 03:55:19.800]  they and even now even with that boom that they had
[03:55:19.800 --> 03:55:26.440]  their their gdp did their um uh the level of
[03:55:26.440 --> 03:55:31.160]  income per person ranks among the lowest in the
[03:55:31.160 --> 03:55:35.640]  world only a few but yeah maybe the communist insiders yeah the 400
[03:55:35.640 --> 03:55:39.080]  million have a lot but then you got a billion at you know or
[03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:42.520]  900 million that don't have yeah i think you're right i think it's like 1.3
[03:55:42.520 --> 03:55:45.800]  actually yeah so what you have is they're very
[03:55:45.800 --> 03:55:51.080]  concerned about riots and i guess what they're concerned about it
[03:55:51.080 --> 03:55:53.480]  everywhere you know what the riots are always over some even over food and
[03:55:53.480 --> 03:55:56.440]  stuff it's the bureaucrats beating people up and
[03:55:56.440 --> 03:55:59.880]  being above the law and the cops it's just it's what's triggering it and also
[03:55:59.880 --> 03:56:03.640]  with this same thing in brazil they said we're tired of being shoved around
[03:56:03.640 --> 03:56:07.480]  and the corruption yeah the corruption and and it's the same story
[03:56:07.480 --> 03:56:12.680]  everywhere so now figure it out you got three million people taken to the
[03:56:12.680 --> 03:56:16.120]  streets i don't care how many soldiers you have
[03:56:16.120 --> 03:56:21.160]  or how many cops you have you're not going to control three million people
[03:56:21.160 --> 03:56:24.840]  not going to control three million people without a lot of mass slaughter
[03:56:24.840 --> 03:56:27.960]  and i don't believe it's going to happen in most countries
[03:56:27.960 --> 03:56:31.800]  it's not going to go no no the the the corrupt elite are going to jump on jets
[03:56:31.800 --> 03:56:35.720]  and fly out exactly exactly and that's what we're
[03:56:35.720 --> 03:56:39.960]  going to start seeing more and more of because there are too many you know my
[03:56:39.960 --> 03:56:43.960]  saying when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose it
[03:56:43.960 --> 03:56:46.680]  and that's what you're going to start seeing so when we're looking at this
[03:56:46.680 --> 03:56:50.200]  economic forecast i am still a holder of gold
[03:56:50.200 --> 03:56:53.800]  if i did not buy all that real estate that i just bought last year
[03:56:53.800 --> 03:56:57.640]  i would be buying gold now but i've been buying gold since 19 i don't even look
[03:56:57.640 --> 03:57:01.320]  at the price of it because i know that it's an artificial market they're
[03:57:01.320 --> 03:57:04.440]  artificially suppressing it artificially suppress there's no question
[03:57:04.440 --> 03:57:06.840]  that's on record let's jam in one call because i promised
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:10.600]  you're mike and alabama now you're our tail gunner i don't have time to get to
[03:57:10.600 --> 03:57:13.240]  the other mic go ahead mike and alabama
[03:57:13.240 --> 03:57:17.880]  okay hey i'm about retirement age and i got about 25 or 30 thousand dollars and
[03:57:17.880 --> 03:57:21.560]  i'm looking at three different options i can only afford one of the three
[03:57:21.560 --> 03:57:26.600]  would you put into a modest uh income property a rental property or would you
[03:57:26.600 --> 03:57:30.680]  put it in silver and gold or would you put it in 20 acres out in the woods
[03:57:30.680 --> 03:57:33.080]  somewhere where you'll have a getaway place
[03:57:33.080 --> 03:57:37.480]  well i don't get financial advice but if it was me and and that's the amount of
[03:57:37.480 --> 03:57:39.880]  money that you had and you could put it into
[03:57:39.880 --> 03:57:42.600]  rental property and bring an income from it
[03:57:42.600 --> 03:57:47.400]  it might be a wise it might be a wise move only and a little bit in gold
[03:57:47.400 --> 03:57:52.120]  but i'll tell you why i was talking before about mortgage rates
[03:57:52.120 --> 03:57:55.240]  and how they're increasing you're going to see it start seeing this whole
[03:57:55.240 --> 03:57:58.040]  housing things start to slow down big time
[03:57:58.040 --> 03:58:01.080]  and people don't have enough money to buy homes they're going to be renting
[03:58:01.080 --> 03:58:04.920]  yeah the elites are all flooding into renting yeah so follow what the big
[03:58:04.920 --> 03:58:08.840]  maggots are doing and again only if it's good property and an affordable rate
[03:58:08.840 --> 03:58:12.040]  exactly and you know that's all the money you're gonna have that's a good idea
[03:58:12.040 --> 03:58:15.000]  if i had the 30 grand that's what and i was gonna be able to have a part-time
[03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:18.040]  job or something i'm fairly retired i would go with the property and guns
[03:58:18.040 --> 03:58:21.400]  i mean you've probably already got guns uh i mean i'm just the middle of nowhere
[03:58:21.400 --> 03:58:24.520]  where nobody wants to be case things really get bad
[03:58:24.520 --> 03:58:27.800]  but like gerald said if you can do a good deal then personally other rental
[03:58:27.800 --> 03:58:30.440]  things a great idea all right folks that's it for this four-hour
[03:58:30.440 --> 03:58:33.640]  transmission info originally news tonight seven
