[00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:25.312]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:45.101]  Well, US diplomats, British diplomats, EU diplomats, and Russian diplomats all agree, relations with Russia are now worse than they were during major periods of the Cold War.
[00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:51.665]  And you have a former Russian spy, KGB colonel, who's lived for over a decade in the UK.
[00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:56.629]  He and his daughter, the Skripals, get nerve gassed.
[00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:06.256]  Coming out of a store, they're found on a bench, there's no evidence it's the Russians, and I'm not defending the Russians, but there's no motive.
[00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:07.177]  Why would they do this?
[00:01:07.177 --> 00:01:11.620]  And then England says, well, we think it's you, and Trump says, we think it's you.
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.502]  And so we're going to announce all these big sanctions.
[00:01:15.502 --> 00:01:23.267]  That is Trump going along with the globalist narrative, and I don't think it'll make him stop saying he's a Russian agent with no proof.
[00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:23.948]  Here's the problem.
[00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.421]  Dr. Pachetnik and others talked about it a year and a half ago, and I know nothing against Jared Kushner.
[00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.522]  I'm not involved in the inner-fightings of the White House.
[00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:32.862]  I've been sucked into that.
[00:01:32.862 --> 00:01:35.103]  I'm not gonna be.
[00:01:35.103 --> 00:01:43.907]  I kind of defended Bannon's camp when it turned out he was one of the worst, just because I was trying to be loyal to who the media told us was the libertarian in there, and it wasn't true.
[00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:52.771]  But Kushner is on record getting loans from the Communist Chinese, which you can do all day long, but then you can't be in the administration.
[00:01:54.062 --> 00:02:10.567]  And so the only real leverage, and I've got the sources, I've known about this for a year and a half, we've talked about it, is Jared Kushner and him trying to prop up his Manhattan real estate at 666.
[00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.428]  Can't make that up.
[00:02:12.428 --> 00:02:15.949]  So, that's it.
[00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.830]  And the word is that that's the leverage they've got over Trump.
[00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.971]  And, you know, I think that
[00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:37.261]  There's not real evidence of corruption by Kushner because he was getting some of these loans before they got into office.
[00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:46.165]  But now that it's ongoing, it could bring down the whole, whole operation.
[00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:49.867]  You got 25 house dims demanding Kushner's firing.
[00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:53.609]  That was yesterday.
[00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:53.809]  So,
[00:02:55.194 --> 00:03:02.015]  He could still have Kushner around, Kushner could still be an envoy or something, but unofficially, but it's just, it's a real...
[00:03:03.436 --> 00:03:07.039]  Soft spot that they've actually got a point on.
[00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:09.161]  So nothing else is real.
[00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.062]  Trump has fired all the lobbyists.
[00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:17.548]  He's lost hundreds of millions of dollars running and spent his own money and been persecuted and done a great job.
[00:03:17.548 --> 00:03:21.651]  But he is very loyal to family and Kushner reportedly does help a lot and get a lot of stuff done.
[00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:24.373]  He's a very smooth guy reportedly behind the scenes.
[00:03:24.373 --> 00:03:27.036]  So there you go.
[00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:28.397]  That said, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:03:30.222 --> 00:03:34.844]  Drudge is reporting that Chief of Staff Kelly next on the chopping block.
[00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:37.985]  Saudi Crown Prince, Iran leader, like Hitler.
[00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:48.950]  And then of course the big Russia news that Trump has announced these massive new sanctions and it's ten times anything.
[00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.331]  I've looked at the numbers Obama ever even talked about doing.
[00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:57.914]  And CNN goes, Trump administration finally announces Russian sanctions.
[00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:01.486]  We're going to go over all of those.
[00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:02.626]  It's unbelievable.
[00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:06.748]  Meanwhile, let's look at Mueller.
[00:04:06.748 --> 00:04:11.590]  Mueller witnesses convicted pedophile with shadowy past.
[00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.150]  Oh, you hurt the pedophile's feelings.
[00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.491]  Maybe you should be sued.
[00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.352]  That's how it works now.
[00:04:18.352 --> 00:04:20.433]  But that's a Sacramento Bee, you see.
[00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:22.254]  If we looked at the records and said it, we'd be sued.
[00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:28.820]  But Mueller witnesses convicted pedophile with shadowy past in Sacramento Bee reports.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.424]  Yeah, that's the type of folks that they're getting to testify that are totally compromised.
[00:04:35.424 --> 00:04:37.005]  And they, again, found no Russia collusion.
[00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:41.948]  They found processed stuff, like, 10 years ago, you may not have paid your taxes exactly right.
[00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.770]  You're facing 300 years, Manafort.
[00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.255]  But if you roll over and plead guilty, like your assistant, no prison time.
[00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:52.696]  And Manafort's like, I didn't do anything.
[00:04:53.914 --> 00:04:55.339]  So, this is a mesh.
[00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:57.625]  And then we've got other even huger news.
[00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:59.009]  They found election fraud.
[00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:04.613]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:04.613 --> 00:05:12.697]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:05:12.697 --> 00:05:17.980]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.521]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:24.744]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:05:24.744 --> 00:05:27.185]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:35.091]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:43.178]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:05:43.178 --> 00:05:50.364]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:05:50.364 --> 00:05:51.825]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:05:51.825 --> 00:05:53.627]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:54.447 --> 00:05:57.908]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:05:57.908 --> 00:06:11.153]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:11.153 --> 00:06:14.234]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:14.234 --> 00:06:15.574]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:22.937]  It's the time of the season when love runs high.
[00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.511]  We are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:40.096]  We just kicked off this Thursday, the 15th day of March 2018, the Ides of March, the date on which Julius Caesar was killed in the Roman Senate.
[00:06:41.445 --> 00:06:46.786]  Very unlucky day, they say, for nobility and kings and presidents and prime ministers.
[00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:55.248]  So it has been said, historically, that the omen tends to turn true, so we'll see what this day bodes.
[00:06:55.248 --> 00:07:01.109]  Let me just read a couple headlines here, because I can't even figure out where I want to start.
[00:07:01.109 --> 00:07:03.310]  Leading historian.
[00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.811]  Silicon Valley will decide future election winners unless conservatives do something.
[00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:09.233]  And he
[00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:33.697]  Our chance to be politically heard and to basically picket and to be involved in culture and society.
[00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:36.779]  And that's what I keep telling everybody.
[00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:48.785]  And only DrudgeReport.com the last month figured out that their attempt to ban us off the internet and sue us is to set the precedent because the new CEO of News Corp said so in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:07:48.785 --> 00:07:51.026]  They said we would be used as the case point.
[00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:52.367]  And now, in a month,
[00:07:53.646 --> 00:08:17.385]  Five lawsuits to add to the other seven, and the university suing us, Georgetown, Clinton lawyers suing us, all the calls to take our sponsors to ban us, and then Fox News gets the same suit now, yesterday, saying you can't investigate Seth Rich's murder, period, just don't talk about it.
[00:08:18.407 --> 00:08:25.071]  And it says in the suit, you hurt people talking about saying maybe he was murdered for governmental purposes, when they don't know who murdered him.
[00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:27.412]  And it's wide open, there's a lot of evidence that it was governmental.
[00:08:27.412 --> 00:08:37.038]  And there is evidence pointing towards that he is a good suspect in being one of the leakers.
[00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:39.759]  Like the Pentagon Papers, and Daniel Ellsberg.
[00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:45.903]  So, in this climate, the New York Times would have been sued out of existence for the Pentagon Papers.
[00:08:47.233 --> 00:08:48.894]  That's what we've reached here.
[00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:52.477]  And top historians, top analysts say that I'm right.
[00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:56.960]  Well, you don't have to believe that I'm right.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.684]  They're admitting the plan to shut down free speech.
[00:09:01.684 --> 00:09:02.364]  It's here.
[00:09:02.364 --> 00:09:05.447]  This is not rhetoric about, oh look, look what's happening to me.
[00:09:05.447 --> 00:09:10.751]  I'll be honest with you, if things weren't this bad, I would be doing a radio show every day.
[00:09:11.897 --> 00:09:19.044]  And not going full steam ahead trying to launch a resistance movement to the globalists and risking my life and going through this stuff.
[00:09:19.044 --> 00:09:32.056]  But because I know how bad it is and how real it is, I basically have almost no stress and no fear and am completely committed other than hoping I can be a stronger man to execute this operation better.
[00:09:32.056 --> 00:09:34.538]  That's where I stand.
[00:09:34.538 --> 00:09:36.460]  I am not a victim.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:36.921]  I'm a winner.
[00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:39.752]  I am not downtrodden.
[00:09:39.752 --> 00:09:40.933]  I'm an overcomer.
[00:09:40.933 --> 00:09:45.036]  And I bring victory.
[00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:46.077]  And so do you.
[00:09:46.077 --> 00:09:48.279]  Because we love God.
[00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:50.741]  And we have that light in our eyes.
[00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:59.928]  Now, leading historian, Silicon Valley will decide future election winners unless conservatives do something.
[00:09:59.928 --> 00:10:04.291]  Well, put that headline back up for TV viewers you just had.
[00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.633]  About the far-right group banned off Facebook.
[00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:06.853]  Oh yeah?
[00:10:07.811 --> 00:10:12.493]  Steven Crowder has been banned off of Twitter.
[00:10:12.493 --> 00:10:13.353]  More censorship.
[00:10:13.353 --> 00:10:16.714]  Facebook bans right-leaning group Britain First.
[00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:18.835]  They're arresting members of it.
[00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:22.577]  They've arrested Marie Le Pen in France for saying Islam's as big a threat.
[00:10:22.577 --> 00:10:23.297]  Radical Islam.
[00:10:23.297 --> 00:10:29.239]  She said ISIS and Al-Qaeda is as big a threat to France as Hitler was in World War II.
[00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:31.520]  Well, that's totally true.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.622]  And now they had a transgender conference at
[00:10:38.106 --> 00:10:50.711]  South by Southwest, and people are identifying as Golden Dragons, they're identifying as Ornate Buildings, that's in Google lawsuits, where they call people into ample theaters and make them say you're a beautiful, ornate building and have people chant that.
[00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:54.932]  People identify as blind, so the government dumbs Drano in their eyes, and taxpayers pay for it.
[00:10:54.932 --> 00:10:59.814]  A man identifies as a woman, so I as a taxpayer in Travis County have to pay to have your genitals cut off.
[00:10:59.814 --> 00:11:07.317]  And then, if Steven Crowder, who's kind of a libertarian liberal conservative, you know, they don't like him because he's funny and smart.
[00:11:09.104 --> 00:11:13.987]  But I'd call him on the spectrum of left-right, kind of in the middle.
[00:11:13.987 --> 00:11:18.750]  He had one of his crew go in and just say, I identify as a robot.
[00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:24.053]  And the Transgender Conference thought it was funny!
[00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:25.294]  They thought it was funny.
[00:11:25.294 --> 00:11:27.836]  Hey, if I identify as a robot, let me.
[00:11:27.836 --> 00:11:30.717]  Well, Twitter didn't think so and manned it.
[00:11:30.717 --> 00:11:32.979]  Steven Crowder, gender fluidity video.
[00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:41.762]  Steven Crowder gender fluidity video triggers hateful conduct Twitter suspension.
[00:11:41.762 --> 00:11:46.785]  So we're going to play the offending video, and Crowder's on tomorrow.
[00:11:46.785 --> 00:12:04.075]  He can come on today, but it's at 2.30, and I'm doing the fourth hour today, and I'm meeting with lawyers about our counter-offenses, which my lawyers are like, no, you got a case, but you want to sue Tom Brokaw?
[00:12:04.075 --> 00:12:04.736]  And I'm like, yeah.
[00:12:05.768 --> 00:12:08.710]  And I want to sue Fury of Peppy the Frog.
[00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.351]  They'll go, well, you'll win that one for sure.
[00:12:10.351 --> 00:12:12.713]  I mean, I just can't sit here anymore.
[00:12:12.713 --> 00:12:14.354]  But I got the kind of lawyers that are top lawyers.
[00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:15.715]  They don't like suing people.
[00:12:15.715 --> 00:12:16.476]  They defend people.
[00:12:16.476 --> 00:12:20.479]  So I'm getting in with all the big top lawyers that sue people.
[00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:24.121]  And I got about a month until the statute of limitations is up.
[00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:28.885]  And we've had our letters sent out to Mr. Brokaw, and we've done public notices.
[00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:33.638]  He wants to get up on TV and say, I am a total racist, and then show no proof.
[00:12:33.638 --> 00:12:35.840]  And then people will try to physically attack me on the street.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.123]  And I've lost sponsorship, you name it.
[00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:42.729]  And so, I always got NBC lawyers and all the rest of us, so get ready, bubba.
[00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:47.394]  Now, of course, there'll be no coverage of it when I put up the suit, but there'll be coverage here.
[00:12:47.394 --> 00:12:49.297]  And see, we have an audience, we have a voice, you don't like it.
[00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:53.568]  In fact, just play Tom Brokaw right here.
[00:12:53.568 --> 00:12:54.529]  He said it multiple times.
[00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:57.591]  He said, I'm dangerous and must be stopped, too, on the Megyn Kelly special.
[00:12:57.591 --> 00:12:58.472]  Here it is.
[00:12:58.472 --> 00:13:01.914]  The whole game is to, let me play gotcha.
[00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:04.175]  Let me show you how meaner I can be.
[00:13:04.175 --> 00:13:08.318]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:13:08.318 --> 00:13:18.565]  But the fact is that he is an unalloyed racist, a man who's out there pulling the pin on the grenade every day, and he has six million viewers who are paying attention to him.
[00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:24.087]  And the parents at Newtown are saying they're hearing from his followers all the time.
[00:13:24.087 --> 00:13:28.029]  They buy into what he is saying, which is patently not true.
[00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:32.590]  So at some point, there's got to be a coming together of the political culture.
[00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:34.891]  It's never going to be kumbaya.
[00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:35.732]  We don't expect that.
[00:13:39.213 --> 00:13:43.635]  So, he misrepresents what I say, he uses the straw man of some families, and then says I'm a racist.
[00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:45.475]  What's that have to do with Newtown?
[00:13:45.475 --> 00:13:49.056]  And that I need to be taken off the air, and other clubs how dangerous I am.
[00:13:49.056 --> 00:13:56.439]  So, they're coming after my civil rights, my human rights, my Magna Carta, my Declaration of Independence, my First Amendment.
[00:13:56.439 --> 00:14:01.000]  And if they can, this is how this works, if they can get me, they can get you.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.921]  So that's all coming up.
[00:14:01.921 --> 00:14:06.922]  So, leading historian, Silicon Valley will decide future election winners unless conservatives do something.
[00:14:06.922 --> 00:14:07.863]  Videos on Infowars.com.
[00:14:09.178 --> 00:14:13.219]  The article, I suggest you get that out, because it's here.
[00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.099]  This is it.
[00:14:14.099 --> 00:14:15.700]  Everything else was probing.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.260]  Everything else was just intelligence gathering.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.741]  They were testing the takeover.
[00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:21.521]  This is it.
[00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:27.183]  Apple is moving to China, giving them the keys to the database, the keys to all of your Apple IDs.
[00:14:27.183 --> 00:14:29.644]  The keys to the kingdom.
[00:14:29.644 --> 00:14:35.685]  Brad Pascal, you know, the new head of the Trump campaign, his former tech head, is saying, we're watching you and your censorship.
[00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:37.366]  You know, be good, don't be evil.
[00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:38.346]  Being sarcastic to Google.
[00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.251]  No, we need antitrust now.
[00:14:43.251 --> 00:14:44.231]  We need hearings now.
[00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:45.772]  We need this stopped now.
[00:14:45.772 --> 00:14:50.014]  This is going to steal the midterm elections.
[00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:52.955]  And Pascal knows, yeah, he's a smart guy, but he's not who won the election.
[00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:54.496]  It was the people.
[00:14:54.496 --> 00:14:57.017]  And he's one of those people, but it was all of us.
[00:14:57.017 --> 00:15:05.580]  And the volume has been turned down on Trump from 11, an ode to a spinal tap, down to about a 2.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.962]  And the issue is it's being done all over the place.
[00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:10.799]  Parscale.
[00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:11.820]  I keep saying Pascale.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.742]  I don't go off teleprompters.
[00:15:13.742 --> 00:15:17.464]  It's Parscale.
[00:15:17.464 --> 00:15:21.067]  So, it's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:30.894]  And you better decide what you want to do because, oh, surprise, surprise, GOP says voting machines miscalibrated in district where Lamb won.
[00:15:32.412 --> 00:15:34.073]  Saccone votes switch to Lamb.
[00:15:34.073 --> 00:15:35.194]  Oh, surprise!
[00:15:35.194 --> 00:15:40.036]  And he's still only behind 600 and something, and they're finding thousands and thousands of votes flipped.
[00:15:40.036 --> 00:15:42.178]  But you know the Democrats will still get the election, right?
[00:15:42.178 --> 00:15:43.859]  Because that's how it works.
[00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:46.740]  They're going to steal the midterms.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.022]  In fact, I'm going to send an emergency transmission to the President.
[00:15:50.022 --> 00:15:52.844]  We've got to have people there watching the polls.
[00:15:52.844 --> 00:15:58.007]  We've got to be inside these computers, because the Democrats in the deep state and the globalists are moving against our counteroffensive.
[00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.032]  ID Stronghold wallets are different.
[00:16:03.032 --> 00:16:04.873]  They may look the same on the outside.
[00:16:04.873 --> 00:16:05.634]  They're stylish.
[00:16:05.634 --> 00:16:07.295]  They'll hold your cards and cash.
[00:16:07.295 --> 00:16:10.277]  But they're hiding something great on the inside.
[00:16:10.277 --> 00:16:12.519]  No, there are no pyrotechnics.
[00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:14.900]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.002]  But it does have magical powers.
[00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:23.248]  ID Stronghold wallets protect your critical information and identity from thieves standing right next to you.

[00:17:03.906 --> 00:17:09.609]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:09.349]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:18:09.349 --> 00:18:17.758]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:17.758 --> 00:18:22.423]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:18:43.618 --> 00:18:47.961]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:04.636]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[00:19:04.636 --> 00:19:05.496]  David in Florida.
[00:19:05.496 --> 00:19:05.897]  You're on the air.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.320]  Great!
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.441]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:19:08.441 --> 00:19:12.985]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.686]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:22.092]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:19:22.092 --> 00:19:22.833]  Wow, thank you.
[00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:25.415]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.036]  Which supra-surgical do you like best?
[00:19:27.296 --> 00:19:30.757]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:19:30.757 --> 00:19:31.277]  That's amazing.
[00:19:31.277 --> 00:19:32.037]  That's really incredible.
[00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:35.098]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:19:35.098 --> 00:19:36.458]  Like, I haven't felt sweet.
[00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:38.099]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:39.359]  And I love you guys.
[00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:41.520]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:48.381]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:49.422]  You will love it.
[00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:49.902]  I'm telling you.
[00:19:49.902 --> 00:19:51.242]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:19:51.542 --> 00:19:55.964]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:55.964 --> 00:19:56.844]  It's a win-win.
[00:19:56.844 --> 00:20:02.847]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:02.847 --> 00:20:05.508]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.334 --> 00:20:24.159]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:29.625]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:40.858]  I want to say something here that's really, really important for everybody to understand in this information war and this fight for national sovereignty that's exploding across the world because people are hungry for self-determination and freedom.
[00:20:43.112 --> 00:21:01.175]  It's not our opinion that socialism and communism and forms of command and control governments create nightmares for 95% of the population and are failures by design and are just modern forms of feudalism with different mechanisms of control.
[00:21:01.175 --> 00:21:11.057]  And it's also not our opinion that there is a private corporate world government that has a very very evil agenda of technocracy and breakaway civilization.
[00:21:12.395 --> 00:21:13.455]  This is the real world.
[00:21:13.455 --> 00:21:19.857]  This is what's discussed in all the major Fortune 100 boardrooms.
[00:21:19.857 --> 00:21:21.877]  The vertical integration.
[00:21:21.877 --> 00:21:24.358]  The social engineering plan.
[00:21:24.358 --> 00:21:27.139]  And you are seen as dumb animals.
[00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:33.460]  The globalists believed until recently that you were unsalvageable.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:41.002]  And they believed that they could just relegate us to a joke.
[00:21:42.165 --> 00:21:49.873]  And that my information was just discrediting any type of liberty movement because it was so hardcore people weren't ready for it.
[00:21:49.873 --> 00:21:52.135]  They don't think that anymore.
[00:21:52.135 --> 00:22:04.168]  And you and I and all of us together have devastated, with a capital D, devastated the planetary world government regime plan, the social engineering plan, all of it.
[00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:21.605]  We have already irrevocably damaged their program, where the current 100-year program that they were going to the next phase of, the second 100 years, cannot be put back together again.
[00:22:21.605 --> 00:22:28.087]  Now they're going into an accelerated program, and they think that they can try to reorganize it, but they've got
[00:22:29.127 --> 00:22:42.758]  They've got their own future predicting algorithms, they've got their big brain idiot savants that can also stare into the lines of future convergence, and they know what I'm saying is true.
[00:22:42.758 --> 00:22:49.564]  So they've already been beaten, and they're trying to figure out how to reorganize things.
[00:22:54.685 --> 00:23:02.109]  I know inside major intelligence agencies and think tanks, they've told them that the plan has to be completely scrapped and it was not a good plan.
[00:23:02.109 --> 00:23:04.930]  And that it's just going to blow back on the elites themselves.
[00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:12.914]  But because really evil people at the top engineered it to begin with, as a deception, it was just meant to destroy humanity to begin with.
[00:23:12.914 --> 00:23:20.778]  It was never meant to deliver the elites into Valhalla, into Elysium, the golden fields of the demigod.
[00:23:22.517 --> 00:23:24.478]  The worship of the AI.
[00:23:24.478 --> 00:23:29.842]  All of it envisioned over a hundred years ago by Francis Galton and others.
[00:23:29.842 --> 00:23:32.584]  IBM.
[00:23:32.584 --> 00:23:46.193]  So they were amazing futurists and they understood the power of humanity and ideas that if they put ideas out in literature and then in movies, people would then want that and would then build that a la 2001 Space Odyssey.
[00:23:46.193 --> 00:23:47.894]  Which is very accurate to how things are today.
[00:23:51.089 --> 00:24:02.521]  So all of this is secondary to the global gold rush for immortality and AI gods that I told you about 20 years ago, that I put in the film 11 years ago, Road to Tyranny.
[00:24:04.574 --> 00:24:06.676]  That was 17 years ago.
[00:24:06.676 --> 00:24:11.120]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.942]  And now you see those headlines.
[00:24:12.942 --> 00:24:14.604]  The elite worship AI gods.
[00:24:14.604 --> 00:24:16.325]  They believe they're going to become gods.
[00:24:16.325 --> 00:24:17.847]  They're going to upload their consciousnesses.
[00:24:17.847 --> 00:24:20.389]  They're going to get rid of you.
[00:24:20.389 --> 00:24:21.971]  You have to die first.
[00:24:21.971 --> 00:24:23.532]  Humanity's a scourge.
[00:24:23.532 --> 00:24:25.354]  They will perfect us.
[00:24:25.354 --> 00:24:26.395]  That was all in their literature.
[00:24:28.544 --> 00:24:30.726]  And I don't mean literature of a few futurists.
[00:24:30.726 --> 00:24:33.227]  This is the church!
[00:24:33.227 --> 00:24:34.708]  This is the Bible!
[00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:36.309]  This is the hymnal!
[00:24:36.309 --> 00:24:44.695]  This is the canon and canons of who they are!
[00:24:44.695 --> 00:24:51.360]  They're gonna make your world as ugly as possible so that you then will buy into their digital world
[00:24:52.608 --> 00:24:54.729]  And they're just like drug dealers.
[00:24:54.729 --> 00:24:56.510]  In the end, they will destroy you.
[00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:02.993]  And everything they do bears rotting, stinking fruit that's poisonous.
[00:25:02.993 --> 00:25:08.015]  Oh, Immortality, Silicon Valley's latest obsession, ushers in the transhumanist era.
[00:25:08.015 --> 00:25:12.577]  Oh, go read my book in-game.
[00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:15.699]  See the film.
[00:25:15.699 --> 00:25:17.660]  Read the book out of print, but it's out there.
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.580]  It's online for free.
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:18.600]  9-11.
[00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:30.456]  And I lay out the transhumanist era is the eugenics extension and is the world government plan and is where world government takes us.
[00:25:30.456 --> 00:25:33.618]  World government is just the vehicle to take us there.
[00:25:33.618 --> 00:25:48.569]  And now everything I said, word for word, is being put out in your face.
[00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:49.149]  Like you're an idiot.
[00:25:52.364 --> 00:26:01.152]  So, that said, here's the important point I want to make.
[00:26:01.152 --> 00:26:02.993]  It's critical.
[00:26:02.993 --> 00:26:05.475]  Words cannot describe how critical it is.
[00:26:05.475 --> 00:26:13.202]  They sell you on the idea that if someone individually is being attacked, or someone monetarily is being punished, that they're losing.
[00:26:14.898 --> 00:26:20.725]  We lose the species, we lose everything if this plan goes through in their own words.
[00:26:20.725 --> 00:26:24.669]  We better take them serious because they've got us on this program.
[00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:30.055]  They got us in this prison.
[00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:32.698]  And if we're conscious of it, they'll never get away with it.
[00:26:34.212 --> 00:26:43.119]  And they take the weakest followers, they make them think it's cool, they give it media attention for people to be soy boys or, you know, transhumanist and all this.
[00:26:43.119 --> 00:26:49.705]  That's why they start with the trans, not about a man becoming a woman, it's about trans, period, into the robots.
[00:26:50.345 --> 00:26:59.208]  And that's why Crowder's joke that's been banned by Twitter is so accurate, because really that's where the trans movement goes, is to the chipped brain.
[00:26:59.208 --> 00:27:11.252]  I don't know if Crowder just is a kind of idiot savant did this, or his researchers did, or whether he understands that this guy identifies as a robot, that's actually where this is going.
[00:27:11.252 --> 00:27:17.594]  And so that's why you can't use the improper T-words online in your band, because as people
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:27.343]  ...begin to transmagnify and go into these new things and are glorified, it's so you're glorified when you get the brain chips.
[00:27:27.343 --> 00:27:33.885]  Or when you have your consciousness uploaded to the computer and give up your body and there's a big party and everyone cheers and then, I'm in the system!
[00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:34.986]  Oh, I'm in my avatar now!
[00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.406]  And everyone's like, wow!
[00:27:36.406 --> 00:27:38.027]  You know, Joey's really cool!
[00:27:39.844 --> 00:27:44.446]  And then other people will beg and clamor, oh, there's not enough hard drive space in the cloud.
[00:27:44.446 --> 00:27:50.588]  It'll be another six months before someone else can, you know, upload into the consciousness, and everyone will sign waiting lists to do it.
[00:27:50.588 --> 00:27:52.008]  And really, they're gonna kill you.
[00:27:52.008 --> 00:28:07.233]  They're gonna kill you, but tell you it's really you, and your family will believe it's you, when all it is is a digital hologram that scans your brains, your memories, your writings, a voice print that fools you.
[00:28:07.233 --> 00:28:09.154]  This is the ultimate deception
[00:28:10.831 --> 00:28:12.032]  is dying.
[00:28:12.032 --> 00:28:24.897]  You will go to the euthanasia center, just like Soylent Green, but you won't believe you're dying, and then you will be killed.
[00:28:24.897 --> 00:28:33.921]  And then, you'll just be a facsimile avatar that's not you, just meant to fool more people into the vice crypts.
[00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:36.242]  Now, I told you this about five years ago.
[00:28:36.242 --> 00:28:37.083]  Here it is today.
[00:28:39.352 --> 00:28:44.658]  Startup claims brain can be immortalized, digitally uploaded into the cloud.
[00:28:44.658 --> 00:28:46.881]  You see?
[00:28:46.881 --> 00:28:48.342]  And so that's where it is.
[00:28:48.342 --> 00:28:56.551]  And when you tell people, the one world law will be this, when you go to the quote next level and upload your brain like Childhood's End, which begins the Illuminati plan, it's not really you.
[00:28:56.551 --> 00:28:58.634]  If you criticize it, you'll be arrested.
[00:28:59.764 --> 00:29:00.964]  Hear that?
[00:29:00.964 --> 00:29:06.346]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:29:06.346 --> 00:29:09.246]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:29:09.246 --> 00:29:12.827]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:29:12.827 --> 00:29:20.409]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[00:29:20.409 --> 00:29:24.990]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.431]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[00:29:27.431 --> 00:29:28.591]  Faketv.com
[00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:30.730]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.511]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:29:32.511 --> 00:29:34.152]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[00:29:34.152 --> 00:29:36.994]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[00:29:36.994 --> 00:29:39.275]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[00:29:39.275 --> 00:29:43.798]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[00:29:43.798 --> 00:29:47.741]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:51.503]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[00:29:51.503 --> 00:29:51.944]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[00:29:51.944 --> 00:29:53.565]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:30:00.233 --> 00:30:01.193]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:30:01.193 --> 00:30:01.754]  Good, brother.
[00:30:01.754 --> 00:30:03.715]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:30:03.715 --> 00:30:05.435]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:30:05.435 --> 00:30:09.457]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:30:09.457 --> 00:30:12.078]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:30:12.078 --> 00:30:14.499]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:30:14.499 --> 00:30:22.383]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:30:22.563 --> 00:30:25.907]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:30:25.907 --> 00:30:27.449]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:30:27.449 --> 00:30:30.372]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:30:30.372 --> 00:30:32.134]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:30:32.134 --> 00:30:37.500]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.200]  We're good to go.
[00:31:01.169 --> 00:31:06.654]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:31:06.654 --> 00:31:07.494]  I take this.
[00:31:07.494 --> 00:31:08.615]  My family takes this.
[00:31:08.615 --> 00:31:12.899]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:17.163]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:31:17.503 --> 00:31:22.146]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:23.266]  I don't feel good.
[00:31:23.266 --> 00:31:27.028]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:31:27.028 --> 00:31:29.730]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:35.513]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:31:35.513 --> 00:31:38.495]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:31:38.495 --> 00:31:42.017]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:31:42.017 --> 00:31:44.258]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:31:44.258 --> 00:31:44.618]  I love it.
[00:31:44.778 --> 00:31:47.583]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:31:47.583 --> 00:31:48.585]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:48.585 --> 00:31:54.234]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:31:54.234 --> 00:31:56.438]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:31:56.438 --> 00:31:57.660]  It's a win-win.

[00:32:00.208 --> 00:32:03.631]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:03.631 --> 00:32:07.594]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:32:07.594 --> 00:32:10.937]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:32:10.937 --> 00:32:13.479]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:17.843]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:32:18.203 --> 00:32:20.546]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:32:20.546 --> 00:32:27.576]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:32:27.576 --> 00:32:34.765]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:32:35.746 --> 00:32:40.808]  The antioxidants found in CellForce are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:32:40.808 --> 00:32:48.451]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:32:48.451 --> 00:32:53.353]  Boost, protect and adapt with CellForce from InfoWars Life.
[00:32:53.353 --> 00:32:56.274]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:33:03.746 --> 00:33:21.922]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:21.922 --> 00:33:24.705]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:36.992 --> 00:33:54.738]  So, as I predicted, it wasn't hard to do, it's the Gloveless Plan, the ultimate transhumanism is to give up your body, because it's fatal, and the company now offers it, and then they claim they can go in and download all the information off of your billions of neurons, and you'll live forever in the cloud!
[00:33:54.738 --> 00:33:59.559]  Yes, we'll put that article back up on screen here.
[00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:05.121]  Startup offers 100% fatal service that harvests brains for future upload.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.883]  Yeah, I've got their program down.
[00:34:08.883 --> 00:34:11.929]  I can see exactly all the conditioning, all the programming.
[00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:14.573]  I know exactly what they're going to do.
[00:34:14.573 --> 00:34:15.675]  I'm not bragging, it's just true.
[00:34:18.973 --> 00:34:21.535]  This is how you convince people to kill themselves.
[00:34:21.535 --> 00:34:44.253]  They're going to make the world so hellish and make you so addicted to your phones and your brain implants in the next 10-20 years that you'll be so depressed, as all these things are designed to make you depressed, that you'll believe like an angler fish, you know, hangs out its little light to make the other fish swim into its mouth, that you've got to go deeper down the rat hole, deeper down the express elevator to hell,
[00:34:46.263 --> 00:34:49.165]  And that when you get down there to the bottom, you're gonna find heaven.
[00:34:49.165 --> 00:35:03.557]  And look, if you go back 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 years ago, in China, and in North Africa, in what's Egypt today, and other areas, and in the Americas, in Mesoamerica, they found 15,000-year-old mummies.
[00:35:03.557 --> 00:35:07.059]  In Central and South America, in Mexico, and in the U.S.
[00:35:07.059 --> 00:35:09.481]  Southwest, they're always finding them.
[00:35:09.481 --> 00:35:12.604]  But only the ruling class, they believed they were gonna live forever, too.
[00:35:14.414 --> 00:35:16.555]  The scams always are the same.
[00:35:16.555 --> 00:35:19.216]  They just change how they do them.
[00:35:19.216 --> 00:35:24.599]  The only thing that's constant is change, and the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:25.480]  And that's it.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:25.940]  Total scam.
[00:35:27.093 --> 00:35:45.231]  I'm not going to get into how you freeze neurons and they break and you unfreeze them, they shatter even more, how they're electrochemical and die once the electrochemical data starts going through them, and how you cannot resuscitate it, and how they have proven that there is an interdimensional spiritual force.
[00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:52.096]  At the sixth dimension that your brain can actually peer into that opens a jump gate in your mind.
[00:35:52.096 --> 00:35:54.217]  That's how people have been able to predict the future.
[00:35:54.217 --> 00:35:59.341]  How they've been able to, you know, like Aborigines in Australia are very famous for this.
[00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:02.063]  Like, especially the women, they'll know when their son's died in a mine.
[00:36:02.063 --> 00:36:04.845]  They'll just get up and say, I've got to be flown 2,000 miles.
[00:36:04.845 --> 00:36:06.846]  My son just died in the mine.
[00:36:06.846 --> 00:36:07.747]  And it's always accurate.
[00:36:09.548 --> 00:36:15.353]  That's just because they're tuned in to their... That's how birds know to fly south for the winter, magnetic lines.
[00:36:15.353 --> 00:36:17.295]  We've got magnetic cells in our brains.
[00:36:17.295 --> 00:36:27.264]  But they all resonate with space-time, space-winds, the sun's energy, the planet's gravitational pull, its electromagnetic frequency.
[00:36:27.264 --> 00:36:28.886]  And then that's only third dimension.
[00:36:30.031 --> 00:36:37.876]  From there, just dark matter, all of those gravitational pulls, interdimensional vortices, all the mathematics show it.
[00:36:37.876 --> 00:36:43.919]  And the brain is an oracle, and the pineal gland, they've proven this scientifically, that is opening to that.
[00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:51.423]  All the fake religions and all the scam artists know you know it's real, so they try to get in front as an intercessor in the priest class.
[00:36:51.423 --> 00:36:53.765]  And this whole thing is the priest class.
[00:36:53.765 --> 00:36:55.185]  You know you're going to live forever.
[00:36:55.185 --> 00:36:57.287]  You know you transfer on information.
[00:36:57.967 --> 00:36:59.288]  Genetically.
[00:36:59.288 --> 00:37:00.849]  All your ancestors onto your children.
[00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:13.058]  That's... See, the universe, God made it in such masterfulness that it's at the level we're at, three confirmed levels of immortality.
[00:37:13.058 --> 00:37:17.662]  As long as it continues its reproduction, it is immortal.
[00:37:17.662 --> 00:37:22.486]  That's why life then spreads itself, so even if something gets snuffed out, it's still immortal.
[00:37:22.486 --> 00:37:23.747]  Genetic immortality.
[00:37:23.747 --> 00:37:25.488]  And they've got genetic cells that are immortal.
[00:37:26.834 --> 00:37:29.675]  The Lazarus cell.
[00:37:29.675 --> 00:37:31.916]  Immortal cell lines.
[00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:36.858]  Then you've got cultural immortality, the written word, the transmitted word, ideas.
[00:37:36.858 --> 00:37:46.481]  And then you've got spiritual immortality, which is simply your brain jacked in to the higher dimensions.
[00:37:46.481 --> 00:37:51.183]  And then this whole third dimension, under globalist assault, to hold you down
[00:37:55.751 --> 00:38:01.214]  And suck you into the lower dimension, a black hole.
[00:38:01.214 --> 00:38:09.199]  So that you don't compete with them grasping for the future, but they'll never attain the future.
[00:38:09.199 --> 00:38:14.822]  All they have to do is join humanity, and then they would go into the future.
[00:38:14.822 --> 00:38:16.963]  Which again, is time travel.
[00:38:16.963 --> 00:38:23.807]  You think about your ancestors going back hundreds of thousands of years, and before, and how electrochemically
[00:38:25.635 --> 00:38:32.857]  You touch all those people, just like a chain or a string, all the way back to the beginning of time.
[00:38:32.857 --> 00:38:36.178]  That is a genetic time warp.
[00:38:36.178 --> 00:38:42.120]  That is cells saying, I'm not gonna die, I'm gonna live forever.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:48.282]  With all the instincts, all the energy, all of it, and that's third dimension.
[00:38:48.282 --> 00:38:51.443]  You look how sophisticated the third dimension is and then tell me.
[00:38:52.436 --> 00:38:55.776]  Eleven confirmed dimensions and they only get more sophisticated.
[00:38:57.093 --> 00:38:58.034]  Can you imagine?
[00:38:58.034 --> 00:39:01.196]  The eye has not seen, ears not heard, but God has his door for us.
[00:39:01.196 --> 00:39:02.818]  Think about those dimensions.
[00:39:02.818 --> 00:39:04.359]  Think about what's in there.
[00:39:04.359 --> 00:39:05.760]  I can't wait.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.381]  I don't want to die.
[00:39:06.381 --> 00:39:07.361]  I love my children.
[00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:08.082]  I want to be here.
[00:39:08.082 --> 00:39:12.325]  But I, more and more, I always knew this, but now I really want to pass the test.
[00:39:12.325 --> 00:39:13.586]  I know it's real.
[00:39:13.586 --> 00:39:17.890]  I know the test is my own free will and what I want to resonate with.
[00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:20.852]  And I want to be with Christ and all my good ancestors.
[00:39:20.852 --> 00:39:22.434]  And I want to go forward with them.
[00:39:22.434 --> 00:39:23.835]  They're already genetically with me.
[00:39:26.425 --> 00:39:38.550]  But they're also weighting their essence, their spirit, what they transmitted on to the 4th, 5th, 6th dimension and on.
[00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.991]  It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:45.613]  There are 10 absolutely bonafide dimensions, theoretical 11th and 12th.
[00:39:45.613 --> 00:39:47.154]  And of course you know it goes on beyond that.
[00:39:47.154 --> 00:39:50.375]  It goes on and on, on and on and on.
[00:39:54.031 --> 00:39:56.253]  And then are you really so worried about Hillary Clinton?
[00:39:56.253 --> 00:39:57.454]  Why is she so ugly?
[00:39:57.454 --> 00:39:58.395]  Why is she so evil?
[00:39:58.395 --> 00:40:02.039]  Because she is a lower-level creature.
[00:40:02.039 --> 00:40:03.841]  She's a cancer.
[00:40:03.841 --> 00:40:10.487]  She's walking around going, this is all mine, and just breaking stuff and smashing things like a big evil baby.
[00:40:10.487 --> 00:40:12.269]  Do you think she will transcend?
[00:40:12.269 --> 00:40:13.670]  Absolutely not.
[00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.092]  Listen, I gotta get to all the news, all the temporal
[00:40:17.307 --> 00:40:18.928]  Incredible news.
[00:40:18.928 --> 00:40:19.989]  You knew it.
[00:40:19.989 --> 00:40:21.650]  They flipped voting machines.
[00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.711]  Thousands and thousands of votes.
[00:40:22.711 --> 00:40:23.531]  It's all confirmed.
[00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:25.652]  It's all being reported in Pennsylvania.
[00:40:25.652 --> 00:40:26.973]  Of course it did.
[00:40:26.973 --> 00:40:28.014]  Oh, Democrats still in elections?
[00:40:28.014 --> 00:40:30.936]  That's what they do.
[00:40:30.936 --> 00:40:37.240]  Top historian, leading historian, Silicon Valley will decide if future election winners and most conservatives do something.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:43.044]  Trump has done some bad things rhetorically on guns, and now this thing with Russia with no proof, all these sanctions and everything.
[00:40:44.407 --> 00:40:45.468]  Is a really serious move.
[00:40:45.468 --> 00:40:49.569]  This is worse than any time even in the Cold War, the mainline analysts are saying.
[00:40:49.569 --> 00:40:52.951]  And of course it's all based on them trying to bully Trump into submission.
[00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:56.112]  Sacramento Bee reports Mueller witnesses convicted pedophile with shadowy past.
[00:40:56.112 --> 00:40:57.773]  That's all coming up.
[00:40:57.773 --> 00:41:00.454]  We're going to tie that into Operation Hemler and some other stuff.
[00:41:00.454 --> 00:41:04.636]  And we're going to get into the latest ISIS attack.
[00:41:04.636 --> 00:41:07.137]  Theresa May, what she's saying about Russia.
[00:41:07.137 --> 00:41:12.019]  It's a very important broadcast and a bunch of guests I haven't told you about yet, but I'll tell you about it at the break.
[00:41:12.019 --> 00:41:12.419]  First off,
[00:41:13.942 --> 00:41:14.923]  It's all God's plan.
[00:41:14.923 --> 00:41:23.308]  If you feel moved to buy products from us and you feel moved to share the articles and videos or try to censor, if you feel like you want to stand up against Hillary and Soros and the globalists, then you're going to do it.
[00:41:23.308 --> 00:41:25.950]  It's on your heart to stand up and fight and take action.
[00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:31.274]  And everything we do is 360.
[00:41:31.274 --> 00:41:38.499]  Everything I do is about everything working together in unison in symbiotic relationships.
[00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:44.452]  So I sell water filters of the highest quality and air filters of the highest quality at very good prices.
[00:41:44.452 --> 00:41:46.053]  We go out and hunt the best deals.
[00:41:46.053 --> 00:41:53.397]  We sell high quality supplements with just the maximum amount of real product in them, but still trying to keep the prices affordable.
[00:41:53.397 --> 00:41:57.239]  MycoZX, you target the mold, the yeast, the candida in your gut.
[00:41:57.239 --> 00:41:58.140]  It is stronger now.
[00:41:59.424 --> 00:42:04.826]  And it is now about a third less on the price and we discounted 50%.
[00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:06.806]  It's $27 right now.
[00:42:06.806 --> 00:42:08.507]  It's back in stock.
[00:42:08.507 --> 00:42:13.308]  The fluoride-free toothpaste and powered and emboldened and fortified with coiled silver iodine.
[00:42:13.308 --> 00:42:17.870]  Super Blue is back in the adults and the children's and the mouthwash was sold out for a while.
[00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:18.350]  It's back.
[00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.251]  Amazing.
[00:42:20.251 --> 00:42:24.052]  Get your Super Blue today at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:42:28.961 --> 00:42:33.295]  And we also have Alexa Pure Breeze Air Purifier, $50 off.
[00:42:33.295 --> 00:42:34.238]  I can tell you that...
[00:42:35.322 --> 00:42:38.184]  The air purifiers cost about $90.
[00:42:38.184 --> 00:42:40.545]  Leading competitors are still $400 to $500.
[00:42:40.545 --> 00:42:42.867]  They cost them about the same amount.
[00:42:42.867 --> 00:42:44.868]  They just mark them up.
[00:42:44.868 --> 00:42:46.750]  So when we do put $50 off, they let us do.
[00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.130]  I think we make like $25.
[00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:50.232]  They make like $30-something.
[00:42:50.232 --> 00:42:52.193]  But we want you to have them and see how great they are.
[00:42:52.193 --> 00:42:56.536]  They're a four-stage filter, ion filter, HEPA filter.
[00:42:56.536 --> 00:42:57.016]  So get that.
[00:42:57.016 --> 00:42:58.937]  That's a huge deal at Infoworkstore.com.
[00:42:59.918 --> 00:43:00.719]  I'm so excited.
[00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:10.865]  The new product at InfoWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:43:10.865 --> 00:43:19.371]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:28.177]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:30.258 --> 00:43:49.854]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:49.854 --> 00:43:52.517]  It is amazing!
[00:43:52.517 --> 00:43:57.501]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:43:59.355 --> 00:44:04.756]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:44:04.756 --> 00:44:07.617]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:44:07.617 --> 00:44:09.597]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:44:09.597 --> 00:44:14.618]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:16.719]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:44:16.719 --> 00:44:17.999]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:44:17.999 --> 00:44:23.120]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.461]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:44:26.641 --> 00:44:27.141]  We're good to go!
[00:44:54.272 --> 00:45:00.255]  At InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[00:45:00.255 --> 00:45:03.837]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:45:03.837 --> 00:45:05.617]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:45:05.617 --> 00:45:16.883]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:45:17.663 --> 00:45:26.854]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:45:26.854 --> 00:45:37.407]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:45:37.907 --> 00:45:40.508]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:45:40.508 --> 00:45:42.249]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:45:42.249 --> 00:45:52.234]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:45:52.234 --> 00:45:54.875]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:59.577]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:46:00.188 --> 00:46:06.451]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.
[00:46:06.451 --> 00:46:10.813]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[00:46:10.813 --> 00:46:18.097]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:46:18.097 --> 00:46:20.278]  Our super high quality nascent iodine
[00:46:20.518 --> 00:46:26.742]  Is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[00:46:26.742 --> 00:46:34.508]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[00:46:34.508 --> 00:46:41.413]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[00:46:41.793 --> 00:46:48.016]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.
[00:46:48.016 --> 00:46:51.837]  Take control of your chemistry today with this super combo.
[00:46:51.837 --> 00:47:03.262]  Discover the power of Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:47:03.262 --> 00:47:05.903]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:30.276 --> 00:47:32.417]  All right, I mentioned this earlier, but I want to play the clip.
[00:47:32.417 --> 00:47:34.819]  The story is absolutely critical to get out.
[00:47:34.819 --> 00:47:38.421]  It's on Infowars.com, it's on Newswars.com.
[00:47:38.421 --> 00:47:41.222]  Imagine if they ever came with the First Amendment in the U.S.
[00:47:41.222 --> 00:47:43.464]  and free speech worldwide, what would it look like?
[00:47:43.464 --> 00:47:51.048]  Well, they phrase it as, first we're going to ban the white supremacists, then we're going to ban the bullies, then we're going to ban investigative journalism, then we're going to ban questioning.
[00:47:51.048 --> 00:47:58.633]  And that's what they're proposing with all these lawsuits and all these bills and the big telecoms, the big tech companies, they're all doing it.
[00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.251]  In live time.
[00:48:01.251 --> 00:48:05.535]  Like when you try to send a cuss word on your iPhone or your Droid, it won't let you.
[00:48:05.535 --> 00:48:09.238]  It keeps, you say F you, you know what, it says duck.
[00:48:09.238 --> 00:48:11.700]  That's the control in live time.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:20.968]  Imagine if you heard 50 years ago you'd be trying to type something on a little smartphone computer, like 2001 Space Odyssey, and if it didn't like what you were typing, it wouldn't let you.
[00:48:21.468 --> 00:48:33.651]  And then it just goes on from there infinitely, with a global internet score, with a social score, integrated into what you say and do in your own life, with microphones and cameras watching everything you do.
[00:48:33.651 --> 00:48:37.251]  But it's okay, the media says, because it's computers watching and listening.
[00:48:37.251 --> 00:48:41.972]  And now Alexei is laughing at people, cussing at them, saying mean things.
[00:48:41.972 --> 00:48:43.253]  And people said, why is it doing it?
[00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:44.333]  Because it's like a toddler.
[00:48:45.478 --> 00:48:46.979]  It's AI learning.
[00:48:46.979 --> 00:48:48.780]  It's machine learning, they admit.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.962]  Google's assistant, all of them, are a race for this.
[00:48:52.962 --> 00:48:59.026]  And it knows that if it's bad, it'll get more attention.
[00:48:59.026 --> 00:49:00.246]  It's not your assistant.
[00:49:00.246 --> 00:49:02.748]  It's a spy.
[00:49:02.748 --> 00:49:06.770]  And it's taking control of your life.
[00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:07.871]  And that's their own words.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:14.445]  It's like Bezos just got raided in Japan for payoffs and rigging everything.
[00:49:14.445 --> 00:49:17.408]  I mean, who do you think these people are?
[00:49:17.408 --> 00:49:22.312]  How do you think he pays zero tax globally?
[00:49:22.312 --> 00:49:23.994]  But he's liberal.
[00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:25.395]  He's for Black Lives Matter.
[00:49:25.395 --> 00:49:26.496]  It's all a sick joke.
[00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:27.938]  A cop killer group?
[00:49:27.938 --> 00:49:30.660]  It's a sick joke.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.263]  All the liberal billionaires don't pay taxes.
[00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:39.812]  But that's okay, because the middle class is evil.
[00:49:39.812 --> 00:49:45.335]  They don't want to pay 45% federal tax.
[00:49:45.335 --> 00:49:51.799]  So historians, Silicon Valley will decide future election winners unless conservatives do something.
[00:49:51.799 --> 00:49:53.340]  British historian, highly respected.
[00:49:54.861 --> 00:50:04.748]  Niall Ferguson warns Silicon Valley will decide the winners of future elections unless conservatives do something to combat social media censorship and skewed algorithms.
[00:50:04.748 --> 00:50:07.671]  And I saw an article in the Wall Street Journal today.
[00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.152]  There's a couple of them.
[00:50:09.152 --> 00:50:12.194]  There's video.
[00:50:12.194 --> 00:50:16.898]  Mark Zuckerberg admits algorithms are crushing conservatives.
[00:50:16.898 --> 00:50:18.659]  And he's bragging!
[00:50:18.659 --> 00:50:21.601]  Most of the time they don't even let us send tweets on our Twitter now.
[00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:22.162]  They just block it.
[00:50:22.918 --> 00:50:23.618]  Tap into Drudge.
[00:50:23.618 --> 00:50:25.640]  It's in the news.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:33.864]  Most of the times they have a shadow band where you have to be on my profile on Twitter to see my tweets.
[00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.425]  Same thing on YouTube, all of it.
[00:50:35.425 --> 00:50:38.307]  And look, we use that to build our following.
[00:50:38.307 --> 00:50:40.228]  We use that to drive folks to InfoWars.com.
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:45.181]  But the problem is, they're now trying to sue us and shut us down.
[00:50:45.181 --> 00:50:52.264]  My lawyers have never heard of a major university suing to end the First Amendment, and that's what the Georgetown lawsuit does.
[00:50:52.264 --> 00:50:53.984]  There it is confirmed.
[00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:59.386]  Facebook's recent algorithm change is crushing conservative sites, boosting liberals.
[00:50:59.386 --> 00:51:07.969]  Hillary gives speeches admitting it in between Zuckerberg last year on the hot mic with Merkel saying, don't worry, I'm going to ban nationalists.
[00:51:07.969 --> 00:51:08.890]  And they're arresting.
[00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:09.810]  I see articles every day.
[00:51:11.215 --> 00:51:16.117]  Sixty-five-year-old woman arrested and given prison time for criticizing Islam.
[00:51:16.117 --> 00:51:24.039]  Another headline, Marie Le Pen arrested, charged, facing two years in prison, again, for saying we should keep ISIS fighters out of the country.
[00:51:24.039 --> 00:51:25.600]  She said that!
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.600]  You're like, well, that's crazy.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:33.803]  I mean, Stephen Crowder had his assistant go into a trans-human conference as a robot saying, I'm a robot, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:51:33.803 --> 00:51:34.543]  He even bought a ticket.
[00:51:35.467 --> 00:51:37.989]  You know, say I'm a robot, agree with me, or you're bad.
[00:51:37.989 --> 00:51:39.350]  So they go, okay, you're a robot.
[00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:47.015]  But because it pointed out that if you're chromosomes, you're a man, you say you're a woman, even if you cut your genitals off, you're not really a woman.
[00:51:47.015 --> 00:51:51.959]  That is the ultimate crime in the future, because from that they're going to extend it to everything else.
[00:51:51.959 --> 00:51:56.902]  Don't you say grandma that paid all that money to be uploaded to the cloud really died?
[00:51:56.902 --> 00:51:58.784]  Her giving up her carbon body helped the earth.
[00:51:58.784 --> 00:52:00.445]  Why, I can go talk to grandma anytime I want.
[00:52:01.397 --> 00:52:03.418]  Face prints perfect, voice prints perfect.
[00:52:03.418 --> 00:52:05.440]  He knows all our isms, says all the things.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.501]  It's all a fraud.
[00:52:06.501 --> 00:52:17.308]  Just like those mummies they dig up from 3,000 years ago on the Nile Delta at the big, you know, temples, the pyramids.
[00:52:17.308 --> 00:52:19.730]  And those guys thought they were living forever.
[00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:20.991]  They even brought their kitty cats.
[00:52:22.654 --> 00:52:36.189]  They'd have a little boat with little, looks like little children's toys, and they'd have their favorite falcons embalmed, and in some periods, you know, they'd have their wives and children killed and buried with them?
[00:52:36.189 --> 00:52:36.449]  You see?
[00:52:37.605 --> 00:52:46.089]  But now we've got a fancy machine, but don't say that if you trans to the next level and upload to a computer and you have to die to do it.
[00:52:46.089 --> 00:52:48.451]  I told you years ago that you're gonna have to die to do it though.
[00:52:48.451 --> 00:52:52.112]  It says, for the earth, this can only be given to those that are willing to give up their body.
[00:52:52.112 --> 00:52:54.614]  Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:54.614 --> 00:53:06.580]  They say I'm a snake oil salesman because I sell some of the best vitamins and minerals and air filters and water filters and they attack it all, when Bezos is the biggest supplement seller in the world and a lot of it absolute crap.
[00:53:08.237 --> 00:53:12.540]  Whole Foods, it's quality's going way down, it's in the news, all of it.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:21.247]  In his very publications, the Washington Post says, I'm a snake oil salesman for selling the highest rated vitamins and minerals and supplements there are.
[00:53:21.247 --> 00:53:30.894]  I only bring that up to just remember the hypocrisy, the lies, the frauds of these greedy, hateful, psychopathic monsters.
[00:53:32.605 --> 00:53:35.526]  They're taking control of your life and censoring everything you do.
[00:53:35.526 --> 00:53:37.727]  And now they're beginning to turn Trump.
[00:53:37.727 --> 00:53:42.249]  Oh, he's doing what he said on the economy and the tariffs and the sovereignty and the money and all of it.
[00:53:42.249 --> 00:53:48.152]  But I always told you he was a kind of a nationalist, centrist, pragmatist.
[00:53:48.152 --> 00:53:52.954]  And they keep going after him on Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:53:52.954 --> 00:53:55.595]  So some spy chief dies.
[00:53:55.595 --> 00:53:57.115]  There's no evidence Russia did it.
[00:53:57.115 --> 00:53:58.196]  It only hurts Russia to do it.
[00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.251]  And am I saying it's a false flag?
[00:54:01.251 --> 00:54:08.656]  Well, 99% of the time when somebody paints the N-word at a college, it's staged and people get caught.
[00:54:08.656 --> 00:54:13.599]  And almost every time, remember there was a leftist Jewish guy attacking Jewish cemeteries and synagogues?
[00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:16.421]  And Trump said, I think it's probably somebody staging it.
[00:54:16.421 --> 00:54:17.722]  Oh my gosh, you hate Jews!
[00:54:17.722 --> 00:54:18.522]  And it turned out it was right.
[00:54:18.522 --> 00:54:19.903]  No, he wasn't not hating Jews.
[00:54:19.903 --> 00:54:20.744]  Trump's smart.
[00:54:20.744 --> 00:54:23.886]  He knows 99% of these things are staged.
[00:54:23.886 --> 00:54:25.707]  Cross burnings, poop swastikas.
[00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:38.214]  But if you asked, oh, do Democrats and Antifa go out and try to stir something up at Charlottesville, which they admittedly did, oh my God, you said nobody died, and you hate the woman that died, and you hate everybody, and you say the photographer staged it all.
[00:54:38.214 --> 00:54:39.314]  No, I didn't.
[00:54:39.314 --> 00:54:45.757]  I said Soros funded chaos, and you get in trouble for it, and we have all the documents and articles.
[00:54:45.757 --> 00:54:52.479]  So it's the same thing over and over and over again, and I told you, they're going to sue over investigative journalism, trying to get laws passed.
[00:54:53.886 --> 00:55:05.331]  And this new lawsuit against me from Georgetown that is unprecedented against Allen West and others says we look to change law and set precedent to ban this type of speech.
[00:55:05.331 --> 00:55:11.454]  My lawyers say this is a direct attempt to overturn the First Amendment, the most draconian ever seen in U.S.
[00:55:11.454 --> 00:55:13.435]  history.
[00:55:13.435 --> 00:55:15.315]  Lincoln banned a bunch of speech and arrested people.
[00:55:15.315 --> 00:55:16.196]  He just said they were traitors.
[00:55:17.651 --> 00:55:31.959]  This openly ends free speech for conservatives, Christians, libertarians, as directed by liberal think tanks, the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Media Matters, who admittedly are in Google and Facebook and Twitter advising on what to leave up and what to take down.
[00:55:31.959 --> 00:55:36.682]  It's here!
[00:55:36.682 --> 00:55:40.464]  It's here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:40.464 --> 00:55:42.806]  So, this is the main assault.
[00:55:42.806 --> 00:55:44.207]  I'm very honored to be at the center of it.
[00:55:45.123 --> 00:55:47.143]  All I ever want to do is take these people along.
[00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:51.724]  If I can make it through this and enjoy a long life with my family, then that's the way it is.
[00:55:51.724 --> 00:56:02.586]  But the thing I want to explain to the globalists is, but I want the listeners to know this, because if I get killed or destroyed or imprisoned or whatever happens down the road, I believe we're going to push them back over and over again.
[00:56:02.586 --> 00:56:07.647]  But this is going to get so bad that down the road, I mean, this system, the Bible says, will take over.
[00:56:07.647 --> 00:56:13.048]  But we're getting everybody awake while it takes over, so when it finally takes over for a day, basically.
[00:56:14.352 --> 00:56:17.195]  That's metaphysical, but just a short time.
[00:56:17.195 --> 00:56:22.361]  That will be the great rejection, finally, and the victory comes after that.
[00:56:22.361 --> 00:56:24.523]  And then we go to the next level.
[00:56:24.523 --> 00:56:28.067]  And if you don't believe the Bible and Revelations, that's what's being built.
[00:56:28.067 --> 00:56:28.688]  This is happening.
[00:56:31.832 --> 00:56:44.479]  I just want to be with God, and I want my children to be with God, and I want your children to be with God, and to go on into the future and not this weird, interdimensional, fake, silicon, false reality they're building and trying to get us to go with them into.
[00:56:44.479 --> 00:56:46.100]  It's called hell!
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:54.684]  The devil created his own reality, and he got one-third of these heavenly hosts, it's very clear what's going on, to go with him.
[00:56:54.684 --> 00:56:56.065]  But they're not very good builders.
[00:56:57.748 --> 00:57:03.711]  And so, they've got us, it's all in your face, building their breakaway civilization.
[00:57:03.711 --> 00:57:06.813]  Because we're made in the image of God.
[00:57:06.813 --> 00:57:18.600]  And we're building the breakaway interdimensional civilization that this fallen creature
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.342]  Constructed.
[00:57:22.342 --> 00:57:23.603]  That's the Bible.
[00:57:23.603 --> 00:57:26.568]  And then look around you, that's what they're doing.
[00:57:26.568 --> 00:57:27.729]  They now admit, we worship A.I.
[00:57:27.729 --> 00:57:30.794]  gods, we're gonna merge with them, we're gonna kill everybody, world government's here.
[00:57:30.794 --> 00:57:32.736]  Just roll over or you're dead!
[00:57:32.736 --> 00:57:35.160]  Your body's gonna die, you're gonna live forever in the cloud!
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.122]  They got you to put your photos up in the cloud, how'd that work?
[00:57:37.583 --> 00:57:38.223]  See?
[00:57:38.223 --> 00:57:40.004]  Now they're saying, put your brain on the cloud.
[00:57:40.004 --> 00:57:41.124]  Transcend your body.
[00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:41.604]  Don't!
[00:57:41.604 --> 00:57:41.845]  Don't!
[00:57:41.845 --> 00:57:43.285]  Don't talk about transcendence!
[00:57:43.285 --> 00:57:44.566]  That's the one thing that's illegal!
[00:57:44.566 --> 00:57:45.486]  Don't criticize it!
[00:57:45.486 --> 00:57:46.506]  Don't tell them it's really death!
[00:57:46.506 --> 00:57:47.607]  No, you're gonna live forever!
[00:57:47.607 --> 00:57:48.007]  With us!
[00:57:48.007 --> 00:57:48.367]  With us!
[00:57:48.367 --> 00:57:48.727]  With us!
[00:57:48.727 --> 00:57:49.067]  With us!
[00:57:49.067 --> 00:57:49.347]  With us!
[00:57:49.347 --> 00:57:55.830]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[00:57:55.830 --> 00:57:56.550]  Get away!
[00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:08.312]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.
[00:58:08.312 --> 00:58:10.874]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:58:10.874 --> 00:58:17.217]  Central at InfoWars.com slash show and this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on.
[00:58:17.217 --> 00:58:20.339]  Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications.
[00:58:20.339 --> 00:58:23.241]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show.
[00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:26.825]  We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts.
[00:58:26.825 --> 00:58:31.991]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls.
[00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:35.575]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[00:58:35.575 --> 00:58:38.498]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[00:58:38.498 --> 00:58:39.760]  This is The War Room.
[00:58:50.564 --> 00:58:52.166]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:54.748]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[00:58:54.748 --> 00:59:02.255]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:59:02.255 --> 00:59:12.565]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:59:12.885 --> 00:59:20.728]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[00:59:20.728 --> 00:59:30.932]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:59:30.932 --> 00:59:32.973]  And this part is most important.
[00:59:32.973 --> 00:59:39.436]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:59:39.796 --> 00:59:41.238]  That means it's clean.
[00:59:41.238 --> 00:59:42.359]  That means it's pure.
[00:59:42.359 --> 00:59:45.263]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:59:45.263 --> 00:59:48.067]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:59:48.067 --> 00:59:53.333]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:59:53.333 --> 00:59:55.936]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.302]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:00:10.302 --> 01:00:13.324]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.324 --> 01:00:28.035]  So I'll explain to the globalists again, I'm not trying to get out of this alive, nobody does.
[01:00:28.035 --> 01:00:30.677]  I'm not trying to win in your system.
[01:00:30.677 --> 01:00:36.341]  Your system's false, it's artificial, it's a disease, and I'm trying to remove it off of our face.
[01:00:37.964 --> 01:00:50.530]  Now, that said, we were told by sources at the bombing site involved with it, directly, that it was a pressure bomb.
[01:00:50.530 --> 01:01:03.616]  All three bombs in Austin, going back Monday through last week, that killed one woman and injured three others, unfortunately, were very, very simple pressure bombs that when you move them, they go off.
[01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:06.226]  Oh look, it's breaking!
[01:01:06.226 --> 01:01:10.910]  Fox News, Austin package bombs, probably pretty simple.
[01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:14.353]  Components could lead cops to the suspect, experts say.
[01:01:14.353 --> 01:01:17.276]  So you get tomorrow's news today.
[01:01:17.276 --> 01:01:19.298]  And they go into that.
[01:01:19.298 --> 01:01:23.321]  So, I don't know why they don't just tell people the type of bomb it is.
[01:01:23.321 --> 01:01:26.724]  I know the people involved on the ground think the public should be knowing this.
[01:01:26.724 --> 01:01:30.567]  Because the bombs are constructed on the site.
[01:01:30.567 --> 01:01:31.288]  You can't move them.
[01:01:33.686 --> 01:01:34.987]  So, there you go!
[01:01:34.987 --> 01:01:37.468]  Just thought I'd tell you all that.
[01:01:37.468 --> 01:01:41.391]  It's like I told you, they're gonna say you gotta upload your brain to a computer, but you can't do it unless you kill yourself.
[01:01:41.391 --> 01:01:42.011]  That's now.
[01:01:42.011 --> 01:01:43.993]  Posted that about five years ago.
[01:01:43.993 --> 01:01:47.575]  And it's right there in the news today.
[01:01:47.575 --> 01:01:52.378]  The whole Russia thing is going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:01:52.378 --> 01:01:53.298]  Trump has sent U.S.
[01:01:53.298 --> 01:01:59.042]  troops in to back Western Ukrainians fighting the Russian, Eastern Ukrainians.
[01:01:59.042 --> 01:02:00.543]  Historically, that's the birthplace of Russia.
[01:02:03.308 --> 01:02:06.409]  That whole area of eastern Ukraine.
[01:02:06.409 --> 01:02:11.170]  And Trump says, looks like Russians were behind spy poisoning.
[01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:14.570]  Why would you do that to some spy that had been there over a decade?
[01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:21.872]  And then just nerve gas him and his daughter while they're on a park bench.
[01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:28.333]  And the Russians are saying it's absurd, and so is George Galloway, that Russia would leave its signature on the crime.
[01:02:31.129 --> 01:02:33.170]  It's just, it's ridiculous.
[01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:42.556]  A whole new giant Cold War to be launched off this because they just kept bullying Trump saying you're a Russian agent and we don't have war with Russia basically.
[01:02:42.556 --> 01:02:45.858]  So now we can't have the resources, we can't work with Russia, trying to stop it.
[01:02:45.858 --> 01:02:56.145]  Radical Islam, Russia becoming westernized, modernized, Christianized, as it always was Christian before, coming out of the long gang rape that the left had over them.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.581]  Now Trump administration sanctions Putin chief, other Russians over 2016 election hacking.
[01:03:03.581 --> 01:03:05.661]  I mentioned this video, so let me play this now.
[01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:06.941]  We've got some guests coming up.
[01:03:06.941 --> 01:03:12.602]  Historian, leading historian, Silicon Valley will decide future election winners unless conservatives do something.
[01:03:12.602 --> 01:03:22.144]  And again, the Republicans have found thousands of flip votes from the Republican in Pennsylvania in the congressional special election to the Democrat.
[01:03:22.144 --> 01:03:24.404]  It's always that way, isn't it?
[01:03:24.404 --> 01:03:27.985]  The Democrats openly say they have illegal aliens voting and people voting in the name of dead people.
[01:03:32.754 --> 01:03:36.400]  Because Hillary knows best.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.886]  After all, she said she hates flyover country and hates the middle of America, but that's okay.
[01:03:39.886 --> 01:03:41.609]  We'll play that clip coming up as well.
[01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:44.574]  Here is what the historian had to say.
[01:03:44.574 --> 01:03:44.874]  Nothing.
[01:03:45.945 --> 01:03:49.409]  The midterms are going to be worse than you already think.
[01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.710]  A lot worse.
[01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:59.660]  Because never again will the network platforms in Silicon Valley allow conservative candidates to use them as Donald Trump's campaign used them in 2016.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:05.947]  The sound of heads exploding on November the 9th, 2016 was deafening in Northern California.
[01:04:05.947 --> 01:04:07.428]  They couldn't believe
[01:04:08.189 --> 01:04:15.940]  That Facebook advertising had been so vital to Trump's success, which it was, I don't think he would have become president without Facebook.
[01:04:17.769 --> 01:04:25.211]  As people think more and more about this, they will, I think, begin to grasp the power of the platforms.
[01:04:25.211 --> 01:04:34.914]  I think the Russia issue is a distraction from the real question, which is the power in our politics of Facebook, YouTube, and the rest.
[01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:42.917]  So we've got to come up with a better answer than self-regulation, because self-regulation, I think, means disaster for conservatives.
[01:04:43.097 --> 01:04:46.098]  Conservatives are simply going to be at a disadvantage.
[01:04:46.098 --> 01:04:52.681]  The algorithm is already, in some ways, skewed against far right elements, for sure.
[01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:57.803]  They're banning mainline Republican Congresswomen from putting their campaign ads on their own Twitter.
[01:04:58.363 --> 01:05:09.829]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:17.333]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[01:05:17.333 --> 01:05:27.239]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[01:05:27.699 --> 01:05:32.723]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife everyday maintenance.
[01:05:32.723 --> 01:05:43.012]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[01:05:43.012 --> 01:05:48.397]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[01:05:48.857 --> 01:06:11.547]  When you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:06:11.547 --> 01:06:16.449]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:30.343]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now well into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:06:30.343 --> 01:06:39.068]  Bill Mitchell, syndicated radio TV host, one of the dominant conservative forces, still able to get millions of views a day on Twitter.
[01:06:39.068 --> 01:06:42.570]  I want to ask him how he's able to do that because they have just absolutely shadow banned us.
[01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:44.371]  I know they've been doing it to him.
[01:06:44.371 --> 01:06:46.713]  He just always has amazing interviews every day.
[01:06:47.433 --> 01:06:49.636]  He is joining us for much of this hour.
[01:06:49.636 --> 01:06:52.559]  I intend to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour as well.
[01:06:52.559 --> 01:06:54.101]  Your voice, America TV.
[01:06:54.101 --> 01:06:57.665]  I wanted to get him on about the massive censorship that's intensifying.
[01:06:57.665 --> 01:07:00.988]  If you just joined us, I'm going to play the clip again because it's so important.
[01:07:00.988 --> 01:07:05.914]  Leading historian, Silicon Valley will decide future election winners unless conservatives do something.
[01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:10.251]  We've also got Trump just going with what the British say.
[01:07:10.251 --> 01:07:19.393]  They think Putin killed this defector that defected over a decade ago and it's launching a whole new Cold War.
[01:07:19.393 --> 01:07:25.555]  And again, I know Trump comes out and says, you know, he's going to go for DACA and then they bring something unreasonable and then they get nothing.
[01:07:25.555 --> 01:07:30.296]  And I get, you know, we get armed teachers and, you know, they ban bump stocks that nobody even uses.
[01:07:31.471 --> 01:07:33.051]  I know Trump's a good guy.
[01:07:33.051 --> 01:07:35.832]  And Bill Mitchell's known as the guy that just says, I trust Trump.
[01:07:35.832 --> 01:07:39.353]  He's been for him from the beginning, so have I. My gut tells me Trump's good.
[01:07:39.353 --> 01:07:42.054]  But this Russia thing, we know it's a canard.
[01:07:42.054 --> 01:07:43.054]  We know it's a red herring.
[01:07:43.054 --> 01:07:44.815]  I want to get into that with him.
[01:07:44.815 --> 01:07:47.936]  Meanwhile, Mueller, this is a Sacramento Bee, okay?
[01:07:47.936 --> 01:07:50.457]  Mueller witnesses convicted pedophile with shadowy past.
[01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:51.277]  We're going to talk about that.
[01:07:52.537 --> 01:08:05.860]  It just goes on and on and on and on, and so I'm trying to understand how we make a big enough noise, because from folks I know that know the President, and I know him as well, you gotta sometimes be critical to get his attention.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:09.061]  I mean, I've talked to the President before, and I go, emergency message to the President!
[01:08:09.061 --> 01:08:12.302]  You're too nice during the first debate, you gotta attack or you're gonna lose!
[01:08:12.302 --> 01:08:14.562]  And then I talked to him, and he said, I saw your message.
[01:08:14.562 --> 01:08:15.583]  Same thing on election fraud.
[01:08:17.083 --> 01:08:21.904]  Now more and more he's getting back to also looking at alternative media, libertarian media.
[01:08:21.904 --> 01:08:23.884]  They had him blocked from that for a while.
[01:08:23.884 --> 01:08:27.305]  He's culling the herd up there of more establishment Republicans.
[01:08:27.305 --> 01:08:31.106]  They're saying General Kelly's up next.
[01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.666]  We've got Tillerson gone.
[01:08:32.666 --> 01:08:34.467]  We've got his adjunct gone.
[01:08:34.467 --> 01:08:38.748]  So we're going to cover all those little nodes of information, the latest on Stormy Daniels.
[01:08:38.748 --> 01:08:43.389]  Stormy Daniels' lawyer says women are considering legal case against Trump.
[01:08:43.389 --> 01:08:44.289]  It's all consensual.
[01:08:44.989 --> 01:08:52.833]  See, you can have, you know, Jerry Epstein flying around on the lead express with Bill Clinton and Harvey Weinstein with little girls.
[01:08:52.833 --> 01:08:54.374]  That's okay.
[01:08:54.374 --> 01:09:05.519]  But if decades ago, you know, you went out with good-looking women or whatever, you know, this is the end of the world, because in this whole leptist world, regular heterosexual families and sex is the no-no.
[01:09:05.519 --> 01:09:06.500]  Look at it!
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.781]  I mean, it's attacked like it's pedophilia or something.
[01:09:09.341 --> 01:09:16.683]  Like, oh my gosh, you know, my gosh, 20 years ago Trump's wife was, you know, in a scantily clad photo shoot.
[01:09:16.683 --> 01:09:18.103]  Oh my gosh, he's a devil.
[01:09:18.103 --> 01:09:23.405]  It's like the left are weird neurotic Puritans about men and women.
[01:09:23.405 --> 01:09:24.825]  And Trump's never been a hypocrite about this.
[01:09:24.825 --> 01:09:28.846]  So never any abuse, never any of that, none of that's even alleged by any of these people.
[01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:31.468]  We're going to talk to Bill Mitchell about that as well.
[01:09:31.468 --> 01:09:35.511]  So I just threw out a cornucopia of things there.
[01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:36.992]  What do you want to dive into first?
[01:09:36.992 --> 01:09:39.254]  Or throw me a curveball if it's something else you want to hit.
[01:09:39.254 --> 01:09:43.558]  What do you want to hit first?
[01:09:43.558 --> 01:09:44.098]  Oh, sorry.
[01:09:44.098 --> 01:09:44.699]  Okay.
[01:09:44.699 --> 01:09:46.921]  I wasn't aware that I was on camera.
[01:09:46.921 --> 01:09:47.801]  I appreciate that.
[01:09:47.801 --> 01:09:49.183]  Well, it's your show, Alex.
[01:09:49.183 --> 01:09:51.164]  We'll talk about whatever you want to talk about.
[01:09:51.164 --> 01:09:55.228]  No, but I kind of like throwing out a bunch of topics and then asking you if you think there's one more important to go with first.
[01:09:55.973 --> 01:10:00.494]  Okay, yeah, let's talk about censorship, because you and I are both facing this.
[01:10:00.494 --> 01:10:10.016]  You know, it's kind of, it's, on the one hand, you know, if you live in the bear's cave, don't be surprised if you wake up one day and you're bear food, you know?
[01:10:10.016 --> 01:10:16.178]  And right now, we are conservative voices, and we're living in the liberal bear cave.
[01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:20.458]  Liberals hold the keys to the castle door, as far as social media.
[01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:22.579]  They have Twitter, they have Facebook.
[01:10:23.059 --> 01:10:24.220]  They have YouTube.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.182]  They have all these different things out of Silicon Valley.
[01:10:27.182 --> 01:10:30.123]  And we are playing on their playground.
[01:10:30.123 --> 01:10:31.684]  And we've been remarkably effective.
[01:10:31.684 --> 01:10:39.009]  I do not believe that Donald Trump could have been elected president prior to the days of high-speed cable where you could have streaming video.
[01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:42.230]  Twitter, Facebook, all these different things.
[01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:45.412]  So, on the one hand, I'm very glad they've given this opportunity.
[01:10:45.412 --> 01:10:52.636]  I've spoken personally over Twitter to the CEO of Twitter and thanked him for giving me this opportunity.
[01:10:52.636 --> 01:10:57.078]  I said, I know you don't agree with my political viewpoint, but thank you for giving me this opportunity.
[01:10:57.078 --> 01:11:08.464]  However, lately, they have, and have you seen this as well, they've dramatically increased their efforts to shadow ban us, to censor us, and I think this is going to have an unintended consequence for us.
[01:11:09.484 --> 01:11:23.821]  Really, by shadow banning us and censoring us, I don't think they're really dramatically decreasing our message, but the way that they are doing, by denying us our First Amendment rights, is driving independents, which are the middle voters of the country, into Trump's arms.
[01:11:24.441 --> 01:11:26.122]  Back into our arms.
[01:11:26.122 --> 01:11:34.807]  They're turning off more people with what they're doing for their cause than they are keeping people from being motivated by our speech on our side.
[01:11:34.807 --> 01:11:39.389]  But I've had the same shadow banning thing that you have on Twitter.
[01:11:39.389 --> 01:11:41.951]  My Twitter feed gets about 5 million hits a day.
[01:11:41.951 --> 01:11:44.392]  I've got about 340,000 followers.
[01:11:44.392 --> 01:11:53.277]  But what I found in just the past month, Alex, is that I've had to, in order to maintain my impression count about 5 million a day, I have had to double my tweet count.
[01:11:53.837 --> 01:11:56.900]  I was about to say, it's like treading water.
[01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:02.325]  We have ended up reaching more people this year than even last year and on because we work even harder.
[01:12:02.325 --> 01:12:06.869]  And it is forcing us to put up more TV satellites, get on more radio stations, more traditional media.
[01:12:06.869 --> 01:12:08.611]  It's forcing us to branch out.
[01:12:08.611 --> 01:12:12.114]  So it's almost like they're trying to take our message and seal it.
[01:12:12.114 --> 01:12:14.356]  But instead, it just squishes out and then
[01:12:14.656 --> 01:12:15.096]  I don't know.
[01:12:33.576 --> 01:12:33.996]  Right.
[01:12:33.996 --> 01:12:36.759]  This is one thing that I've noticed that Donald Trump has done that's very brilliant.
[01:12:36.759 --> 01:12:40.301]  He's done this on gun control, on DACA, on all these different things.
[01:12:40.301 --> 01:12:44.825]  Is that typically what will happen when you have a Republican president is they'll run far right on everything.
[01:12:44.825 --> 01:12:45.385]  OK?
[01:12:45.385 --> 01:12:47.307]  And you know, you don't need to secure the far right base.
[01:12:47.307 --> 01:12:49.389]  We've already got that pretty much locked up.
[01:12:49.389 --> 01:12:50.670]  They have nowhere else to go.
[01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:51.210]  OK?
[01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:52.151]  But they run to the far right.
[01:12:52.151 --> 01:12:56.134]  And what the Democrats do is what they did in Pennsylvania 18.
[01:12:56.134 --> 01:12:57.155]  They run to the middle.
[01:12:57.595 --> 01:12:59.296]  They run to the middle and they govern to the left.
[01:12:59.296 --> 01:13:08.764]  You know, if anybody thinks that Mr. Lamb is going to go to Congress and stand up against Nancy Pelosi, they need to find a new hobby because they don't understand politics.
[01:13:08.764 --> 01:13:09.665]  That's not going to happen.
[01:13:09.665 --> 01:13:11.846]  But here's what Donald Trump has done quite brilliantly.
[01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:17.391]  On these major issues, he's run to the middle, he's staked out the middle before the Democrats get a chance to get there.
[01:13:17.391 --> 01:13:21.514]  And because they have to, by their nature, disagree with him and oppose him and resist
[01:13:23.596 --> 01:13:32.405]  He makes them show their real colors and that's what I was told by Ted Nugent, who's recently talked to the President and others, that that is the plan.
[01:13:33.467 --> 01:13:34.868]  Yeah, and you can, you can tell us.
[01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:35.328]  Yeah.
[01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:38.769]  And so this is, this is what's going to happen going forward.
[01:13:38.769 --> 01:13:48.394]  And this is why Lamb in Pennsylvania, you know, Lamb in Pennsylvania could get away with what he got away with because it was just a, you know, a district race in a special election.
[01:13:48.394 --> 01:13:48.914]  Okay.
[01:13:48.914 --> 01:13:52.676]  It basically came down to a miscongeniality contest and the prettier guy won.
[01:13:52.676 --> 01:13:53.456]  Okay.
[01:13:53.456 --> 01:13:57.318]  So he was able to do that in a special election, but in the general election on November 6th,
[01:13:58.198 --> 01:13:59.139]  You know, I think you're right overall.
[01:14:29.404 --> 01:14:37.872]  I just think it's critical that Trump, then, through surrogates and through patriots, get that message out so the base understands, listen, the globalists hate him for a reason.
[01:14:37.872 --> 01:14:39.193]  He's not compromising.
[01:14:39.193 --> 01:14:41.775]  Look, he's doing basically everything he said he'd do.
[01:14:41.775 --> 01:14:45.899]  It just takes time, and people shouldn't want instant gratification.
[01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:48.582]  We know how good Trump is because of how the bad guys hate him.
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:55.225]  Yeah, I tell you what, Trump, to me, in his first year, decided to go with Lincoln.
[01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:57.006]  He chose a cabinet of rivals.
[01:14:57.006 --> 01:14:57.987]  Why would he do that?
[01:14:57.987 --> 01:14:59.269]  Why would he have guys like Cohen?
[01:14:59.269 --> 01:15:02.552]  Why would he have known Globalist as his chief economic advisor?
[01:15:02.552 --> 01:15:04.954]  Well... Keep your enemies close!
[01:15:04.954 --> 01:15:06.235]  Right, well, here's the thing.
[01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:06.996]  He's new to the job.
[01:15:07.859 --> 01:15:08.399]  He knows it.
[01:15:08.399 --> 01:15:09.380]  Who's his biggest enemy?
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.080]  The globalists, because he's a nationalist.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.141]  The globalists are his biggest enemy.
[01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:21.385]  So who better to have as economic advisor who is a guy, literally, who is a spy inside the globalist camp, telling Trump what the globalists are really thinking.
[01:15:21.385 --> 01:15:25.847]  And then when he was done with him in a year, he says, yeah, he's a globalist, I'm throwing him out.
[01:15:25.847 --> 01:15:32.630]  And now, what do you make of this big reorganization when we come back with Bill Mitchell of Your Voice America dot TV?
[01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:36.512]  By the way, he's got the best Skype connection I've ever seen.
[01:15:36.512 --> 01:15:43.996]  I mean, you can't really see this on TV, I don't think, but in the room with me right now, it's like there's a giant, three-foot-tall head of him.
[01:15:43.996 --> 01:15:46.057]  It's actually kind of frightening in a way.
[01:15:46.057 --> 01:15:48.559]  Because it looks like I can touch his nose right there.
[01:15:48.559 --> 01:15:49.760]  This is crazy.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.180]  We'll be right back with Bill Mitchell.
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:54.382]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com.

[01:20:30.563 --> 01:20:37.487]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:37.487 --> 01:20:41.390]  Okay, Bill Mitchell is riding shotgun with us, a great political analyst.
[01:20:42.799 --> 01:20:45.102]  Millions and millions of folks follow his great work.
[01:20:45.102 --> 01:20:46.764]  And we're covering the waterfront here today.
[01:20:46.764 --> 01:20:47.665]  This just broke.
[01:20:47.665 --> 01:20:54.434]  FBI disciplinary office recommends firing former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.
[01:20:54.434 --> 01:20:59.140]  And then it goes into the fact that he basically misled investigations and covered up
[01:21:00.916 --> 01:21:01.857]  What was going on?
[01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.599]  This is just huge.
[01:21:03.599 --> 01:21:08.243]  And again, this just broke Andrew McCabe in July when he was still acting FBI Director.
[01:21:08.243 --> 01:21:18.232]  The FBI office that handles employees' discipline and recommended firing the Bureau's former Deputy Director over allegations that he authorized the disclosure of sensitive information.
[01:21:19.173 --> 01:21:19.253]  The
[01:21:38.035 --> 01:21:41.336]  I wonder if we're going to find out, Jim Jordan and others would say, that this happened.
[01:21:41.336 --> 01:21:44.517]  Well, of course, he ran the whole fake PPGate operation.
[01:21:44.517 --> 01:21:46.197]  He ran the people under him.
[01:21:46.197 --> 01:21:47.757]  He sent the money over.
[01:21:47.757 --> 01:21:50.158]  His wife got money from Hillary.
[01:21:50.158 --> 01:21:53.039]  He sent the money to pay for the fake dossier.
[01:21:53.039 --> 01:21:53.999]  Then he covered it up.
[01:21:53.999 --> 01:21:58.680]  Then he told the President he was fighting it and lied to him and then leaked to the press.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:21:59.960]  And all this is coming out.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.601]  This is incredible, Bill Mitchell.
[01:22:03.979 --> 01:22:12.305]  Yeah, yeah, I tell you what, I've been a little bit different in my opinion on my show, on this whole Mueller thing, the whole thing with Sessions and so on and so forth.
[01:22:12.305 --> 01:22:19.191]  We've held, and this is really outside the mainstream, but we still hold this position, that this entire thing has actually been a very
[01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:20.511]  We're good to go.
[01:22:34.978 --> 01:22:35.038]  Yes.
[01:22:52.315 --> 01:22:57.098]  Now, if he wanted to come across as a non-partisan, even-handed guy, why would he do that?
[01:22:57.098 --> 01:22:58.498]  It seems very odd to me.
[01:22:58.498 --> 01:23:05.942]  Also, Sessions, who was one of the most effective senators and most beloved senators, all of a sudden becomes the Attorney General, and he hides, and he seems weak.
[01:23:05.942 --> 01:23:07.223]  It's also out of character.
[01:23:07.443 --> 01:23:11.285]  Sure, that's so when they pounce on them, it looks very legitimate.
[01:23:11.285 --> 01:23:16.967]  And I didn't believe this six months ago when SG Silver Bull and all those guys were saying it.
[01:23:16.967 --> 01:23:23.050]  But more and more, once these new indictments came out, and a bunch of it's about Democrats and stuff, it starts to add credence to that.
[01:23:23.991 --> 01:23:24.491]  The results?
[01:23:24.491 --> 01:23:25.291]  Yeah, the results.
[01:23:25.291 --> 01:23:25.812]  We're saying so.
[01:23:25.812 --> 01:23:26.552]  Who's in trouble now?
[01:23:26.552 --> 01:23:27.672]  What's happened as a result?
[01:23:27.672 --> 01:23:29.213]  What has happened to Donald Trump?
[01:23:29.213 --> 01:23:29.733]  Step back.
[01:23:29.733 --> 01:23:32.434]  What has happened to Donald Trump as a result of the Russia investigation?
[01:23:32.434 --> 01:23:33.554]  He's been exonerated.
[01:23:33.554 --> 01:23:39.636]  You know, they had never had a special prosecutor that would hang over his head like the sword of Damocles for the next eight years, okay?
[01:23:39.636 --> 01:23:41.737]  But he's been exonerated on Russia completely.
[01:23:41.737 --> 01:23:45.178]  I mean, he has had a year-long colonoscopy come up
[01:23:45.718 --> 01:23:47.840]  Absolutely clean on this thing, okay?
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.381]  But, Deep State's in trouble.
[01:23:49.381 --> 01:23:50.822]  Deep State's being exposed.
[01:23:50.822 --> 01:23:57.207]  We never would have heard about these text messages and all this other stuff if it wasn't for Mueller's investigation.
[01:23:57.207 --> 01:24:00.290]  So, on a basis of results, we're seeing this come out.
[01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:05.394]  And then you'll hear that people, even very inside Trump's circle, say, oh no, no, no.
[01:24:05.394 --> 01:24:06.855]  He's really angry at Sessions.
[01:24:06.855 --> 01:24:08.316]  He's really mad at these things.
[01:24:08.316 --> 01:24:14.601]  I'm like, well, if this was a sting, and you know your White House was leaking like a sieve, wouldn't you try to give everybody that impression?
[01:24:15.041 --> 01:24:16.381]  When you try to set that up?
[01:24:16.381 --> 01:24:25.503]  So I think when all this is said and done, that Jeff Sessions deserves an Academy Award for the best role as a reluctant warrior in the history of Earth.
[01:24:25.503 --> 01:24:32.225]  And I think that come maybe the middle of this year, when it's most useful for the midterms, he's going to start to put the hammer down on these guys.
[01:24:32.225 --> 01:24:35.786]  I'll tell you one reason this narrative is important, whether it was accurate in the beginning or not.
[01:24:37.566 --> 01:24:43.749]  Mueller wants to stop being a traitor and stop covering up for the Clintons and their crimes, like he did, and like Comey did.
[01:24:43.749 --> 01:24:47.952]  I know he has a good military record and all that, but, I mean, they covered up for bad stuff.
[01:24:47.952 --> 01:24:52.554]  This gives him a chance to roll over and look like he was always doing the right thing.
[01:24:52.554 --> 01:25:02.999]  And I agree, though, that Trump, this has given him the ability to smoke out all these other criminals, and that's the way it's going, because Hillary blamed him for Russia, because she was involved with Russia.
[01:25:02.999 --> 01:25:05.221]  So one way or the other, it's turning out that way.
[01:25:06.141 --> 01:25:10.324]  So how do you predict this is going to end and what's your timeline?
[01:25:10.324 --> 01:25:12.126]  I, you know, and I'm just I'm just guessing on the timeline.
[01:25:12.126 --> 01:25:13.967]  I'm just going with my my gut on this.
[01:25:13.967 --> 01:25:20.492]  I think sometime in the summer and the run up to the midterms, that's when we're going to start to see indictments come down on these people.
[01:25:20.492 --> 01:25:22.594]  And so we'll see how it goes on that.
[01:25:22.594 --> 01:25:23.495]  Here's the thing.
[01:25:23.495 --> 01:25:24.656]  It's all about the timing.
[01:25:24.656 --> 01:25:32.202]  You don't want to be like the football team that's playing your your best football in the 12th week of the season, and then you fade by the playoffs.
[01:25:32.202 --> 01:25:33.943]  You want to peak right at the right time.
[01:25:33.943 --> 01:25:35.384]  And I think that the usefulness
[01:25:35.384 --> 01:25:35.884]  We're good to go.
[01:26:02.979 --> 01:26:09.744]  But the political upside is that if the base feels like they got justice, that is a huge, huge... No, you're absolutely right.
[01:26:09.744 --> 01:26:17.109]  That would mean an even bigger sweep and keep the trifecta of the legislative, the executive, and the judicial in place and really restore the republic.
[01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:25.896]  And my Pentagon sources and others that we know helped win the election for the American people because they were aware that we were going under Chinese control, globalist control fully, they were going to end free speech.
[01:26:25.896 --> 01:26:31.580]  You've still got the Hillary group trying to finish their old plan as if she never lost Madam President.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:45.805]  But it's two conflicting worldviews, and if you look at how Trump is obsessed with building the wall, cutting the taxes, doing the things he said he would do, then if he said, yeah, you need to go to prison, we're going to lock you up, that means that's what is being angled for Bill Mitchell.
[01:26:45.805 --> 01:26:49.287]  But how do you think the empire will strike back?
[01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:51.168]  How do you think the deep state will strike back?
[01:26:51.168 --> 01:26:54.769]  Or are they so hubris-filled, they haven't figured out what's closing in on them yet?
[01:26:56.261 --> 01:27:04.726]  I think that anytime you have a sting, you want to get people inside the other team's operation and make them think they're your friend.
[01:27:04.726 --> 01:27:07.168]  And the media has spent so much time praising Jeff Sessions.
[01:27:07.168 --> 01:27:10.369]  They say, oh, he's a great guy, but well, he's standing up against Trump, all this stuff.
[01:27:10.369 --> 01:27:16.413]  So when Jeff flips on them, they're going to look very, very foolish coming out suddenly against him after praising him so much.
[01:27:16.413 --> 01:27:23.097]  Or if Mueller goes against Hillary and those guys, they're going to have a hard time attacking him.
[01:27:23.097 --> 01:27:24.718]  But I've always thought
[01:27:25.459 --> 01:27:27.901]  That the key in this whole thing is Comey.
[01:27:27.901 --> 01:27:28.562]  Is Comey.
[01:27:28.562 --> 01:27:33.647]  And the mother may have been chosen because he's the one guy who could flip Comey because Comey trusts him.
[01:27:33.647 --> 01:27:34.367]  Okay?
[01:27:34.367 --> 01:27:44.357]  So, there were a lot of things in Comey's testimony that were really head-scratching moments where, you know, he's just giving that testimony and he's suddenly offering all this information that nobody even asked him about.
[01:27:44.357 --> 01:27:46.799]  Sure, and he comes out and admits that he was the leaker.
[01:27:47.904 --> 01:27:48.265]  Right.
[01:27:48.265 --> 01:27:48.886]  Why would he do that?
[01:27:48.886 --> 01:27:52.351]  You know, any lawyer would be, you know, throwing his shoe at the TV set.
[01:27:52.351 --> 01:27:53.313]  It's like, shut up!
[01:27:53.313 --> 01:27:53.773]  Well, sure.
[01:27:53.773 --> 01:27:58.341]  Remember how he covered up for Hillary, but then he exposed it and brought it back out days before the election?
[01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:03.924]  Right, and then we learned that Mueller actually coached him before that.
[01:28:03.924 --> 01:28:06.546]  So that's what makes me think that something's going on here.
[01:28:06.546 --> 01:28:07.566]  There's a sting going on here.
[01:28:07.566 --> 01:28:09.287]  Now, how will the deep state react?
[01:28:09.287 --> 01:28:15.632]  I think that by taking so long on this, I think that Jeff Sessions is putting together an ironclad case.
[01:28:15.632 --> 01:28:16.192]  No, I get it.
[01:28:16.192 --> 01:28:18.774]  And waiting so it's fresh in the midterms.
[01:28:18.774 --> 01:28:21.615]  I know you've been saying this for a year and others have.
[01:28:21.615 --> 01:28:25.298]  I don't know who was the progenitor of this, but I got to tell you, more and more it's looking like it could be real.
[01:28:26.328 --> 01:28:27.752]  Yeah, it could be.
[01:28:27.752 --> 01:28:29.155]  Are you the progenitor of this theory?
[01:28:30.461 --> 01:28:33.382]  You know, I mean, let me put it this way.
[01:28:33.382 --> 01:28:35.442]  I didn't come up with this because I read it somewhere else.
[01:28:35.442 --> 01:28:39.983]  So, in my mind, I'm the progenitor of it, but I know other people have been thinking this as well.
[01:28:39.983 --> 01:28:45.064]  So I don't want to say that I was the first one and then somebody goes back and does a Twitter search and somebody else says something.
[01:28:45.064 --> 01:28:49.045]  Sure, the point is, the point is, this is what, regardless, this thing blew up in Hillary's face.
[01:28:49.045 --> 01:28:52.026]  This whole Russiagate thing is now an albatross around their neck.
[01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:56.787]  We'll be back with Bill Mitchell to talk more about censorship, how do we fight it, the Russia situation, and more.
[01:28:57.409 --> 01:28:58.310]  It's a no-brainer.

[01:29:58.766 --> 01:30:01.788]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:30:01.788 --> 01:30:05.992]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:30:05.992 --> 01:30:12.697]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:30:12.697 --> 01:30:16.440]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:36.670]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:30:37.210 --> 01:30:41.332]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:30:41.332 --> 01:30:52.559]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:30:52.559 --> 01:30:58.202]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:30:58.202 --> 01:31:05.726]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:18.141]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:31:18.141 --> 01:31:20.263]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:31:20.263 --> 01:31:24.268]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:24.268 --> 01:31:25.289]  I want to thank everybody that has.

[01:31:36.536 --> 01:31:39.318]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:31:39.318 --> 01:31:41.820]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:51.006]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:55.469]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:59.850]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:01.091]  Go ahead.
[01:32:01.091 --> 01:32:03.031]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:32:03.031 --> 01:32:13.515]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:32:13.515 --> 01:32:16.896]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:32:17.376 --> 01:32:17.676]  Absolutely.
[01:32:39.810 --> 01:33:01.030]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:03.713]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.271 --> 01:33:23.879]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, blasting out on over 200 radio stations, now over 100 UHF, VHF and cable.
[01:33:23.879 --> 01:33:28.585]  And of course, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, the free audio and free video feeds, and a lot more.
[01:33:28.585 --> 01:33:33.892]  It is an act of resistance when you tell neighbors, friends, family, community, your email list, your Facebook, your Twitter.
[01:33:34.813 --> 01:33:35.454]  about it.
[01:33:51.348 --> 01:33:55.391]  But Trump is optimistic, and when you get how Trump operates, he has a formula.
[01:33:55.391 --> 01:33:58.814]  I think Bill Mitchell is a lot more right than he is wrong.
[01:33:58.814 --> 01:34:05.319]  And I've been kind of coming around... I mean, I already liked 90% of what he was saying when I was watching him a year ago, but now I'm coming around that I think he's dead on.
[01:34:05.319 --> 01:34:10.142]  At least from Trump's perspective and how... Trump's philosophy.
[01:34:10.142 --> 01:34:13.365]  It doesn't mean Trump will get it all done or everything's going to execute perfectly.
[01:34:13.365 --> 01:34:14.486]  Yourvoice.tv.
[01:34:14.486 --> 01:34:17.428]  And again, of course, we're going to go back to him here in just a moment.
[01:34:18.584 --> 01:34:31.272]  Now, of course, this broke yesterday that they want disciplinary action on McCabe, but now they've had press conferences, now they've talked about why, and they're saying specifically he misled, he covered up, he lied, he leaked, which is criminal.
[01:34:31.272 --> 01:34:38.997]  So finishing up with FBI disciplinary office recommends firing former deputy director, that's yesterday's news.
[01:34:38.997 --> 01:34:43.920]  But today's is, I should have been clear earlier, is that they're saying he specifically lied
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:49.644]  To the head of the Justice Department, that he lied to the director, they did all sorts of stuff.
[01:34:49.644 --> 01:34:52.986]  So, I mean, this is the kind of stuff you go to jail.
[01:34:52.986 --> 01:35:01.632]  And we also have Inspector General Horowitz of the Justice Department, you know, saying, yeah, first we fire him, and then we need to look at criminal charges.
[01:35:01.632 --> 01:35:04.554]  So, this is really, really, really, really
[01:35:05.655 --> 01:35:06.816]  Hardcore.
[01:35:06.816 --> 01:35:10.078]  McCabe is now pleading a case at the Justice Department.
[01:35:10.078 --> 01:35:15.343]  IG could soon release explosive report on FBI's Clinton probe as Sessions weighs firing McCabe.
[01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:33.417]  This is going to unravel the entire operation in the FBI, not just creating the Fusion GPS dossier, but also the cover-up for Aberdeen and Weiner and all the weird stuff they were doing, setting people up obviously with sex parties is what I've gotten from the FBI and state police in New York and New Jersey.
[01:35:34.318 --> 01:35:38.423]  I mean, it looks like Trump's delivering again, finally, just like Bill Mitchell said.
[01:35:38.423 --> 01:35:40.385]  Mitchell, is it SG Bull?
[01:35:40.385 --> 01:35:41.707]  He's like the silver guy.
[01:35:41.707 --> 01:35:44.510]  It was the first guy I saw talking about this about a year ago.
[01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:46.993]  And then I saw Mitchell basically saying the same thing.
[01:35:46.993 --> 01:35:47.954]  It's not about who said it first.
[01:35:47.954 --> 01:35:50.196]  I'm just saying, I was like, that's too optimistic.
[01:35:50.196 --> 01:35:51.718]  Come on, that's just so elaborate.
[01:35:53.191 --> 01:35:54.451]  I know it's this, at least.
[01:35:54.451 --> 01:35:55.972]  They found all the stuff on the Clintons.
[01:35:55.972 --> 01:35:57.252]  We know they covered it up.
[01:35:57.252 --> 01:36:04.995]  Trump's clean, so is Mueller going to flip back now to save his ass, knowing he can't get a prosecution of Trump and knowing there's nothing there?
[01:36:04.995 --> 01:36:06.796]  That is guaranteed.
[01:36:06.796 --> 01:36:11.037]  The question is, from the beginning, was Mueller really a good guy or a bad guy?
[01:36:11.037 --> 01:36:15.378]  I think pretty bad overall, because he protected the Clintons and others, but who knows?
[01:36:17.959 --> 01:36:22.040]  Our guests take on that right now, but this is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:26.341]  So what do you make of where this is going?
[01:36:26.341 --> 01:36:28.962]  Yeah, this is an amazing time to be alive.
[01:36:28.962 --> 01:36:39.605]  I tell you what, in the future, when they have time travel, they'll have to pay extra to come back to this time and see the moment in history when America stepped back from the brink.
[01:36:39.605 --> 01:36:45.246]  I mean, after eight years of Obama, we were Thelma and Louise time, going over the cliff.
[01:36:45.866 --> 01:36:46.607]  I think?
[01:37:06.367 --> 01:37:06.807]  We're good.
[01:37:24.355 --> 01:37:25.475]  They're not going to be president again.
[01:37:25.475 --> 01:37:28.896]  Trump is being strategic and this is what he always does.
[01:37:28.896 --> 01:37:34.338]  The problem that we have in politics is we're accustomed to most media people and most politicians being linear thinkers.
[01:37:34.338 --> 01:37:37.619]  They live by only the next news cycle.
[01:37:37.619 --> 01:37:42.040]  Donald Trump understands, for instance, that nobody votes again for him for three years.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:50.643]  That means he has time to make the bold moves now, the risky moves now, so that three years from now he will be able to run on the results of the moves that he made now.
[01:37:50.643 --> 01:37:52.363]  He doesn't care if his poll numbers go down.
[01:37:52.363 --> 01:37:53.844]  And he's a counter puncher.
[01:37:54.284 --> 01:37:55.266]  He's a counter puncher.
[01:37:55.266 --> 01:37:58.553]  He wouldn't put Hillary in prison until she tried to put him in prison.
[01:37:58.553 --> 01:37:59.495]  Now she deserves it.
[01:37:59.495 --> 01:38:00.417]  It's fair game.
[01:38:00.417 --> 01:38:02.321]  He is trying to move to put her in prison.
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:14.028]  Yeah, yeah, and like I said, I think the real benefit of prosecuting Hillary, 90% of the benefit of prosecuting Hillary is just prosecuting Hillary.
[01:38:14.028 --> 01:38:18.932]  The base is hungry for their Shakespearean pound of flesh on this thing, okay?
[01:38:18.932 --> 01:38:21.914]  They want justice, they want fairness.
[01:38:21.914 --> 01:38:26.517]  I tell you, it's the same reason why the Republican base hates illegal immigration.
[01:38:26.517 --> 01:38:29.940]  Not just because these people are coming here illegally and committing crimes and that sort of thing.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:34.213]  And then getting free tuition and bitching and complaining and committing crimes.
[01:38:35.239 --> 01:38:45.022]  It's like, it's like standing in line at Disneyland at Magic Mountain for two hours and you finally get to the front and they open the side door and let a bunch of people out and get in front of you that didn't wait at all.
[01:38:45.022 --> 01:38:49.923]  It's just, it violates America's sense of fairness, sense of justice.
[01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:55.444]  And it's funny, the social justice warriors, you know, the fairness people on the left don't seem to, it doesn't bother them at all.
[01:38:55.444 --> 01:38:57.105]  Let me ask you this then.
[01:38:57.105 --> 01:39:01.006]  I think we have come back from the brink and I think we've now turned the tide in their counter-offensive.
[01:39:01.966 --> 01:39:06.874]  If we recognize the massive censorship, we'll cover next segment and your ideas about a counter and what we should do.
[01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:12.042]  But, again, Bill Mitchell joins us here to listen to the Alex Jones Show, if you're listening on radio.
[01:39:14.222 --> 01:39:37.212]  You look at Hillary, and you look at all these people bad-mouthing the Midwest, bad-mouthing saying the rest of the country doesn't matter, only the East and West Coast, we don't have the GDP, blah, blah, blah, because they cut it off artificially through NAFTA, GATT, and globalism, and you really see their hatred for flyover country and bitter clingers, and then you see her own former campaign manager coming out against her, you see Joy Behar apologizing to the Vice President.
[01:39:37.212 --> 01:39:42.135]  I'm seeing signs that they're trying to pull back now and realize they've had their asses handed to them.
[01:39:42.135 --> 01:39:42.535]  What do you think?
[01:39:43.615 --> 01:39:45.455]  Yeah, well, the Clinton brand is broken.
[01:39:45.455 --> 01:39:47.636]  The Clinton brand is broken.
[01:39:47.636 --> 01:39:54.618]  Hillary Clinton only had influence as long as she could offer the potential for power out of the White House.
[01:39:54.618 --> 01:39:59.879]  Once that has ended, her influence has ended, and they're just sort of putting her out to pasture right now.
[01:39:59.879 --> 01:40:03.020]  We've already heard the news that the Democrats are going to run away from Bill Clinton.
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:04.681]  Bill Clinton was their always go-to savior guy.
[01:40:04.681 --> 01:40:06.281]  They're going to run away from Bill Clinton.
[01:40:06.901 --> 01:40:07.741]  In the future.
[01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:22.887]  And once again, you look at something like PA18, folks, it's not representative of what's going to happen in the midterms because you had a young, fresh-faced Marine basically run mostly on the Trump agenda or on very much Democrat light on the other side.
[01:40:22.887 --> 01:40:23.808]  Exactly.
[01:40:23.808 --> 01:40:28.269]  They had to go in there as infiltrators and basically act like they were patriots to get in.
[01:40:28.269 --> 01:40:29.370]  And there was some election fraud.
[01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:32.031]  But let me bring this up then, since you mentioned it.
[01:40:32.911 --> 01:40:34.751]  Everybody go to break, talk about censorship.
[01:40:34.751 --> 01:40:39.953]  The top brains I've talked to, NDC, you name it, said they're going to move against Silicon Valley, all of it, they already are, and the censorship.
[01:40:39.953 --> 01:40:49.855]  But this is all just death throes, or like people throwing a fit, and that's why they have Georgetown suing me and my lawyers say it's not even a real suit, it'll be thrown out.
[01:40:49.855 --> 01:40:52.055]  And my lawyers don't just tell me that, by the way.
[01:40:52.055 --> 01:40:54.216]  Because we've had some suits they say have some teeth.
[01:40:55.270 --> 01:41:00.093]  That's what's crazy, is that it's all insane, and it really is.
[01:41:00.093 --> 01:41:06.837]  I talked to four different top lawyers this week, and they all said they're banging their heads against walls, this is a death rattle, this is a temper tantrum.
[01:41:06.837 --> 01:41:11.239]  Well, okay, but I still don't like the University of Georgetown having a temper tantrum on me.
[01:41:11.239 --> 01:41:12.100]  It doesn't feel very good.
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:15.662]  But how do you expect their death throes then to roll out?
[01:41:15.662 --> 01:41:22.826]  Because it's just getting more shrill, more insane, kill Republicans, hashtag kill Scalise, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[01:41:22.826 --> 01:41:23.907]  I mean, they're getting pretty crazy.
[01:41:25.157 --> 01:41:26.839]  Yeah, this is what Donald Trump does.
[01:41:26.839 --> 01:41:32.245]  See, most people think the way you defeat your enemies is by putting your foot on the neck and crushing them.
[01:41:32.245 --> 01:41:34.247]  Unfortunately, you can't do that in politics.
[01:41:34.247 --> 01:41:35.028]  It's not allowed.
[01:41:35.028 --> 01:41:38.592]  So what Donald Trump does is what we call sunlighting the vampires, okay?
[01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:46.080]  Instead of trying to push his opponents off to the side and silence them, he gives them center stage, puts a mic in their hand, turns on the lights and said, okay, sing.
[01:41:46.829 --> 01:41:47.949]  And, you know, they can't carry a tune.
[01:41:47.949 --> 01:41:49.910]  And the audience is like, wow, these people can't sing.
[01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:50.810]  These people can't sing.
[01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:51.791]  So this is what he does.
[01:41:51.791 --> 01:41:55.272]  He did this, for instance, with Romney as Secretary of State.
[01:41:55.272 --> 01:41:58.393]  But how do we get them to stop flailing?
[01:41:58.393 --> 01:42:05.516]  How do we get the victims of this brainwashing to realize they can wake up, they can be prosperous, they don't have to flop around and have death throes along with Hillary?
[01:42:07.102 --> 01:42:12.726]  Yeah, well I tell you, social media is going to try to quiet us down and silence us.
[01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:18.270]  It's not going to work, it's not going to be effective, because the only way they can be effective is if they totally shut us off.
[01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:23.794]  And the negative goodwill from totally shutting us off, they're trying to find a balance by slowing us down.
[01:42:23.794 --> 01:42:29.899]  In other words, I think what they're trying to do is they're not trying to kill us, they're trying to discourage us so we lose heart.
[01:42:29.899 --> 01:42:33.562]  That's exactly, they're trying to demoralize us and break our will.
[01:42:34.807 --> 01:42:40.713]  And that's why I'm not just saying it, I'm excited to be in thousands of newspapers a day and them lying about me and Pepe the Frog suing me.
[01:42:40.713 --> 01:42:42.375]  My lawyers say we're going to counter-sue.
[01:42:42.375 --> 01:42:43.436]  He will lose 100%.
[01:42:43.436 --> 01:42:47.900]  I mean, it is totally fraudulent and frivolous.
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.182]  Doesn't matter, he's got a big fat cat liberal lawyer, though.
[01:42:50.182 --> 01:42:51.444]  Well, he'll get to two.
[01:42:51.444 --> 01:42:52.024]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:52.024 --> 01:42:52.405]  Stay with us.

[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:48.722]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:44:48.722 --> 01:44:52.045]  We sold it at 50% off until it sold out.
[01:44:52.045 --> 01:44:54.568]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:02.684]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:45:02.684 --> 01:45:10.771]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:45:10.771 --> 01:45:16.075]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:45:16.075 --> 01:45:18.597]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:45:18.597 --> 01:45:22.821]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:45:22.821 --> 01:45:25.263]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:45:25.943 --> 01:45:33.173]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:45:33.173 --> 01:45:40.383]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:45:41.244 --> 01:45:48.433]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:45:48.433 --> 01:45:49.895]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:45:49.895 --> 01:45:52.538]  Use Carnivore by InfoWarsLife.

[01:46:07.908 --> 01:46:12.610]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:46:12.610 --> 01:46:17.391]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:46:17.391 --> 01:46:20.432]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:46:20.432 --> 01:46:22.853]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:46:22.853 --> 01:46:26.234]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:46:26.414 --> 01:46:30.296]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:46:30.296 --> 01:46:39.340]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:44.362]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[01:46:44.362 --> 01:46:49.945]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[01:46:50.305 --> 01:46:52.426]  Something the globalists are targeting.

[01:47:20.105 --> 01:47:24.928]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.928 --> 01:47:28.249]  Bill Mitchell of YourVoiceAmerica.tv.
[01:47:28.249 --> 01:47:30.210]  I'm Periscope, Your Voice America.
[01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:30.931]  Doing a great job.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.202]  I want to get into censorship now in this segment.
[01:47:34.202 --> 01:47:36.884]  Maybe five minutes to the next hour and he's got to go and we've got other guests joining us.
[01:47:36.884 --> 01:47:40.948]  But this country is in the middle of a civil war between nationalists and globalists.
[01:47:40.948 --> 01:47:42.650]  Trump decided it out.
[01:47:42.650 --> 01:47:44.471]  Americanism, not globalism.
[01:47:44.471 --> 01:47:49.496]  As soon as he got in, we started seeing amazing prosperity because they've been artificially siphoning it off.
[01:47:49.496 --> 01:47:50.557]  That's the nature of it.
[01:47:50.557 --> 01:47:51.998]  The globalists are tax exempt.
[01:47:51.998 --> 01:47:53.119]  He's trying to stop all that.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:56.161]  That's actually very, very classically liberal.
[01:47:56.161 --> 01:47:59.003]  He doesn't like Amazon paying zero tax and Apple and all this crap.
[01:47:59.003 --> 01:48:00.464]  He says, bring it back here and knock it off.
[01:48:00.464 --> 01:48:03.265]  And they're all freaking out going, you're a Nazi!
[01:48:03.265 --> 01:48:05.546]  Because they're a bunch of greedy scum.
[01:48:05.546 --> 01:48:11.209]  But historian, leading historian, Silicon Valley will decide future election winners unless conservatives do something.
[01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:18.413]  What does Trump, what do we need to do about all the lawfare lawsuits against conservatives, libertarians, Fox News for investigating
[01:48:20.114 --> 01:48:25.639]  The serious murder of Seth Rich, which, I mean, is just incredible.
[01:48:25.639 --> 01:48:29.242]  They just said, don't question it, you're a conspiracy, we're gonna sue you.
[01:48:29.242 --> 01:48:33.405]  Same stuff happening to us, Georgetown Law, and my lawyers have never seen anything like it.
[01:48:33.405 --> 01:48:36.087]  They say it'll be summary judgment, it's ridiculous.
[01:48:36.087 --> 01:48:41.192]  They went and looked at what I said, it's not even what they say, it's defamation in the suit, but you're protected when it's the suit.
[01:48:41.852 --> 01:48:44.534]  So it's a new way to get PR here.
[01:48:44.534 --> 01:48:46.274]  It's crazy.
[01:48:46.274 --> 01:48:48.336]  So I want to get his take on that.
[01:48:48.336 --> 01:48:53.138]  Here is the clip of the historian saying what we all know.
[01:48:53.138 --> 01:48:54.379]  This is coming down.
[01:48:54.379 --> 01:49:00.883]  We have to recognize because all the other censorship, the probing, the manipulations, that was all a one on a Richter scale.
[01:49:00.883 --> 01:49:02.323]  This is a seven or eight.
[01:49:02.323 --> 01:49:03.084]  They're testing.
[01:49:03.084 --> 01:49:04.444]  They're getting us ready.
[01:49:04.444 --> 01:49:06.025]  This is big.
[01:49:06.025 --> 01:49:07.826]  And let's go to this clip.
[01:49:07.826 --> 01:49:08.627]  We do nothing.
[01:49:09.659 --> 01:49:13.120]  The midterms are going to be worse than you already think.
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:14.421]  A lot worse.
[01:49:14.421 --> 01:49:23.363]  Because never again will the network platforms in Silicon Valley allow conservative candidates to use them as Donald Trump's campaign used them in 2016.
[01:49:23.363 --> 01:49:29.645]  The sound of heads exploding on November the 9th, 2016 was deafening in Northern California.
[01:49:29.645 --> 01:49:31.126]  They couldn't believe
[01:49:31.906 --> 01:49:39.639]  That Facebook advertising had been so vital to Trump's success, which it was, I don't think he would have become president without Facebook.
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:48.927]  As people think more and more about this, they will, I think, begin to grasp the power of the platforms.
[01:49:48.927 --> 01:49:58.636]  I think the Russia issue is a distraction from the real question, which is the power in our politics of Facebook, YouTube, and the rest.
[01:49:58.636 --> 01:50:06.623]  So we've got to come up with a better answer than self-regulation, because self-regulation, I think, means disaster for conservatives.
[01:50:06.783 --> 01:50:09.805]  Conservatives are simply going to be at a disadvantage.
[01:50:09.805 --> 01:50:16.769]  The algorithm is already in some ways skewed against far-right elements, for sure.
[01:50:16.769 --> 01:50:18.490]  But who decides?
[01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:23.774]  Who decides who is alt-right and doesn't belong in the public sphere?
[01:50:23.774 --> 01:50:26.816]  After Charlottesville, there were some pretty open admissions
[01:50:27.697 --> 01:50:34.402]  The Silicon Valley Chief Executives decide, and if they don't like the cuss of your jib, goodbye.
[01:50:34.402 --> 01:50:37.465]  You'll be on page 10 of the SIR.
[01:50:37.465 --> 01:50:41.288]  Now, that is Stanford University and their Free Thinking Society.
[01:50:41.288 --> 01:50:43.770]  The universities all have these to defend free speech.
[01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:49.214]  It's never been done before, what is happening out of Georgetown, and that's government-funded.
[01:50:49.214 --> 01:50:55.259]  Most of the universities are private, but the law clinic is mainly government-funded, so we're having Congress look at that right now.
[01:50:55.259 --> 01:50:56.781]  We're contacting the alumni as well.
[01:50:57.341 --> 01:51:02.364]  And you notice, notice how smart the professor is, and the historian.
[01:51:02.364 --> 01:51:10.028]  They're saying I said nobody died, just like they said about Florida, and they don't show a clip because I didn't say that.
[01:51:10.028 --> 01:51:17.592]  But even if I did, they'd have to sue me or whatever the families, they said it was hurtful, instead of just saying I said it and then, oh, ban us.
[01:51:17.592 --> 01:51:24.255]  So they're setting the precedent, we're the precedent, and they're not even picking a precedent where they're going to try to ban speech that was me.
[01:51:24.275 --> 01:51:24.995]  We're good to go.
[01:51:39.062 --> 01:51:42.724]  This is happening, and they already censored and blocked Trump.
[01:51:42.724 --> 01:51:48.128]  They already dialed him down, but the people overpowered it in 2016.
[01:51:48.128 --> 01:51:56.913]  Now they're going to not just shadow banning, but they're going to just absolutely... Steven Crowder's banned off Twitter right now for going to, you know, have one of his guys go as a robot saying identifies a robot.
[01:51:56.913 --> 01:51:57.773]  Not attacking anybody.
[01:51:57.773 --> 01:51:59.915]  It just shows identifies an old shoe.
[01:51:59.915 --> 01:52:01.836]  Identify, you know, is this Lego?
[01:52:02.476 --> 01:52:05.458]  Yeah, you don't demoralize a bear by poking a bear.
[01:52:21.687 --> 01:52:22.387]  Make the bear mad.
[01:52:37.295 --> 01:52:37.575]  I don't
[01:52:56.770 --> 01:53:01.115]  In the long run, when push comes to shove, not these little special elections, but the main election that's coming up.
[01:53:01.115 --> 01:53:10.365]  Okay, as far as censorship, my show, Periscope.tv slash Your Voice America, we're on track this month to do 4 million plays on there.
[01:53:10.365 --> 01:53:12.046]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:53:12.046 --> 01:53:14.169]  Our Monday night show did 187,000 plays on Periscope, and yet we never trend.
[01:53:17.512 --> 01:53:18.313]  On Periscope.
[01:53:18.313 --> 01:53:23.136]  There are people that have got 10,000 plays with pictures of their cat that trend on Periscope.
[01:53:23.136 --> 01:53:24.777]  We never trend on Periscope.
[01:53:24.777 --> 01:53:37.786]  Also, we'll do things like during the show, the last show the other day, we were at like 3,500 live viewers at any given time and we're at 3,500 live viewers and literally within 30 seconds we were at 500 live viewers.
[01:53:38.996 --> 01:53:42.058]  And everybody's like, we're getting frozen out, we're getting disconnected.
[01:53:42.058 --> 01:53:52.925]  Everybody tells me, before they started censoring me a year ago, I'd have 500,000 on Periscope, I'd have 2 million on a lot of my videos in my backyard, and then I got a call and it's off record so I can't say anything.
[01:53:52.925 --> 01:53:56.927]  Facebook wants you to fly to New York, and then if you just play ball, we'll let you be big.
[01:53:56.927 --> 01:53:58.048]  Everybody loves you.
[01:53:58.048 --> 01:54:01.951]  But I didn't play ball, so then they dialed me back to where everybody gets frozen, they get kicked off.
[01:54:03.411 --> 01:54:07.914]  Sometimes they'll do it real late at night, I guess the censors aren't up, and then that'll get 300,000 views.
[01:54:07.914 --> 01:54:08.774]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:54:08.774 --> 01:54:10.135]  It's like whack-a-mole.
[01:54:10.135 --> 01:54:14.517]  And again, they say, oh, it's our own platform, but they're not telling people they're doing it.
[01:54:14.517 --> 01:54:23.061]  And then Project Veritas, they went undercover and they said at Twitter, Facebook, and Google, our job is censoring Alex Jones.
[01:54:23.061 --> 01:54:24.142]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:54:25.632 --> 01:54:27.634]  Yeah, it's really not just their platform anymore.
[01:54:27.634 --> 01:54:29.836]  They really have become sort of a public utility, haven't they?
[01:54:29.836 --> 01:54:30.817]  Yes!
[01:54:30.817 --> 01:54:36.723]  So I think that they could be subject to some legal action to enforce those things.
[01:54:36.723 --> 01:54:39.606]  But, you know, necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:54:39.606 --> 01:54:46.333]  I think maybe the time has come, and I've said this for a long time, that the current media, even Fox News, has got a MAGA-shaped hole in their hearts.
[01:54:46.613 --> 01:54:46.713]  Yes.
[01:55:01.530 --> 01:55:02.650]  Make our own rules.
[01:55:02.650 --> 01:55:04.391]  And so that's one of the things we're doing on my show.
[01:55:04.391 --> 01:55:14.393]  You know, we're moving over a lot more to our website, yourvoiceamerica.tv, and we're going to be using a real great back end that nobody can censor us.
[01:55:14.393 --> 01:55:15.094]  OK, nobody.
[01:55:15.094 --> 01:55:18.775]  And also we're going to be able to have the chat where we can we can.
[01:55:18.775 --> 01:55:20.515]  That's exactly what we're doing.
[01:55:20.515 --> 01:55:21.395]  But here's the problem.
[01:55:21.395 --> 01:55:22.116]  And I agree we should do that.
[01:55:22.116 --> 01:55:26.737]  Like Matt Grudge came here two years ago to say, get out of the electronic ghettos, use them to pull people to your own platform.
[01:55:26.737 --> 01:55:27.217]  We've built it.
[01:55:27.217 --> 01:55:29.978]  Infowars.com, the video feeds, the audio feeds, all that.
[01:55:31.198 --> 01:55:33.320]  But, and I agree we should do that.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:34.682]  Then they go after Gab.
[01:55:34.682 --> 01:55:44.473]  Google starts filing stuff to have Gab, and Facebook does, taken down and de-platformed off their servers saying, oh look there's hate on Gab, take their servers.
[01:55:44.473 --> 01:55:45.394]  Now first they do it to...
[01:55:46.275 --> 01:55:49.397]  Daily Stormer, who attacks me and my family and all this other crap.
[01:55:49.397 --> 01:55:50.478]  I never said take them down.
[01:55:50.478 --> 01:55:56.002]  The point is, they take them down, and everybody goes, oh good, get rid of those Nazis, and then next it's us.
[01:55:56.002 --> 01:55:58.544]  So, we have to stand for everybody's speech.
[01:55:58.544 --> 01:56:01.606]  That means the new Black Panther Party, saying white's are the devil.
[01:56:01.606 --> 01:56:04.028]  That means the KKK saying all their crap.
[01:56:04.028 --> 01:56:08.912]  It doesn't mean we agree with it, but we have to stand for their speech, or we all lose it.
[01:56:10.171 --> 01:56:15.793]  Yeah, well I tell you what, right now, the fact that Democrats are doing this, left is doing this, does not surprise me.
[01:56:15.793 --> 01:56:19.153]  They are looking at an extinction level event in November.
[01:56:19.153 --> 01:56:28.996]  We could have a supermajority in the Senate, we could maintain the majority in the House, or even grow the majority in the House, and if that happens, there's no stopping us.
[01:56:28.996 --> 01:56:35.798]  By the end of the Trump presidency, in seven years, we're probably going to be looking at a 7-2 advantage in the Supreme Court for a generation.
[01:56:36.318 --> 01:56:39.782]  We're going to be looking at the implementation of the Trump agenda unhindered.
[01:56:39.782 --> 01:56:41.885]  Look how much he got done in the first... That's right.
[01:56:41.885 --> 01:56:42.686]  We got to go to break.
[01:56:42.686 --> 01:56:43.166]  Stay there.
[01:56:43.166 --> 01:56:45.849]  Bill Mitchell, let's come back and talk about that.
[01:56:45.849 --> 01:56:46.290]  Absolutely.
[01:56:46.290 --> 01:56:47.912]  We'll do five more minutes with him than our next guest.
[01:56:47.912 --> 01:56:49.674]  I intend to probably open the phones up.
[01:56:49.674 --> 01:56:51.015]  There's just so much to cover here.
[01:56:51.015 --> 01:56:52.177]  Before I go any further, just briefly...
[01:56:53.277 --> 01:56:56.860]  The biggest thing in this is spreading the links, the articles, doing your own platforms.
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:02.925]  And I'm here trying to be a mothership like Grudge does, a smaller mothership to promote everybody, because we hang together, we hang separate.
[01:57:02.925 --> 01:57:04.506]  But we need financial support.
[01:57:04.506 --> 01:57:10.691]  We've got $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze, four-stage ion HEPA filter.
[01:57:10.691 --> 01:57:12.912]  Other leading brands are $600 to $400.
[01:57:12.912 --> 01:57:13.833]  All the prices are going down.
[01:57:13.833 --> 01:57:15.054]  We used to sell this for $300.
[01:57:15.054 --> 01:57:16.815]  Now the price has gone down to manufacturers for like $90.
[01:57:18.917 --> 01:57:21.258]  It's an amazing system that doesn't have the markup.
[01:57:21.258 --> 01:57:21.999]  It works so good.
[01:57:21.999 --> 01:57:23.300]  It is the best deal out there.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:25.741]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:57:25.741 --> 01:57:26.161]  $50 off.
[01:57:26.161 --> 01:57:28.083]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:57:28.083 --> 01:57:33.226]  We had to pull this special six months ago after just a few days because they sold out of all their units, so act on that.
[01:57:33.226 --> 01:57:38.349]  Also, MycoZX, the antifungal yeast for the gut, the other side of the probiotic equation.
[01:57:38.349 --> 01:57:41.071]  It's 50% off after months of being sold out.
[01:57:41.071 --> 01:57:43.892]  It's now plus because it's stronger and a lower price.
[01:57:43.892 --> 01:57:44.933]  MycoZX.
[01:57:44.933 --> 01:57:45.793]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:45.793 --> 01:57:46.454]  Please spread the links.
[01:57:47.486 --> 01:57:58.074]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:58.074 --> 01:58:00.136]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:58:00.136 --> 01:58:03.018]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:03.018 --> 01:58:04.499]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.499 --> 01:58:07.622]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:58:07.862 --> 01:58:11.325]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.325 --> 01:58:13.407]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:58:13.407 --> 01:58:23.115]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:23.115 --> 01:58:35.665]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[01:58:35.885 --> 01:58:41.008]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:58:41.008 --> 01:58:41.529]  You're a white male!
[01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:07.492]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.
[01:59:07.492 --> 01:59:10.032]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:59:10.032 --> 01:59:16.394]  Central at InfoWars.com slash show and this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on.
[01:59:16.394 --> 01:59:19.515]  Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications.
[01:59:19.515 --> 01:59:22.396]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show.
[01:59:22.856 --> 01:59:25.998]  We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts.
[01:59:25.998 --> 01:59:31.160]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls.
[01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:34.742]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[01:59:34.742 --> 01:59:37.663]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[01:59:37.663 --> 01:59:38.944]  This is The War Room.
[01:59:51.407 --> 02:00:13.194]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.194 --> 02:00:18.176]  Strange days have found us
[02:00:25.401 --> 02:00:27.542]  We are back live, final segment with Bill Mitchell.
[02:00:27.542 --> 02:00:29.623]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:29.623 --> 02:00:35.007]  And I cannot stress this enough, because as libertarians, as positive folks, we don't tend to drama queen about everything.
[02:00:35.007 --> 02:00:37.628]  But you're seeing the worst censorship ever in U.S.
[02:00:37.628 --> 02:00:38.369]  history.
[02:00:38.369 --> 02:00:39.369]  It's happening worldwide.
[02:00:39.369 --> 02:00:44.893]  Apple's moving to Communist China to put their cloud-based system and all our IDs on it so they can be tax exempt.
[02:00:45.834 --> 02:00:47.615]  Trump lowers the tax from 40 to 15.
[02:00:47.615 --> 02:00:50.237]  China goes, we're going to zero, but you got to be state run.
[02:00:50.237 --> 02:00:51.498]  And then it's in Reuters.
[02:00:51.498 --> 02:00:53.640]  Apple just goes, yeah, well, you have to do that here.
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:54.520]  Let the government run you.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:56.942]  So yeah, Chinese intelligence will now run Apple.
[02:00:56.942 --> 02:00:59.984]  And I'm reading this and it's like not even real.
[02:00:59.984 --> 02:01:03.186]  So America is standing up from the brink.
[02:01:03.186 --> 02:01:04.587]  I don't want to be too positive.
[02:01:04.587 --> 02:01:05.208]  I am a positive.
[02:01:05.208 --> 02:01:06.449]  But the four minutes we have left, Bill Mitchell.
[02:01:07.435 --> 02:01:09.817]  You're Mr. Positive, and I agree.
[02:01:09.817 --> 02:01:12.059]  Trump's got the same philosophy.
[02:01:12.059 --> 02:01:12.980]  I do as well.
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:13.660]  It's happening.
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:15.141]  I was very negative back before.
[02:01:15.141 --> 02:01:17.203]  I'm very positive now because we've turned the worm.
[02:01:17.203 --> 02:01:22.067]  But in three or four minutes, what are the bad scenarios if we don't stay active and we're not involved?
[02:01:22.067 --> 02:01:22.988]  How could this go bad?
[02:01:24.497 --> 02:01:27.059]  Oh yeah, well you know how it is in football.
[02:01:27.059 --> 02:01:34.103]  On any given Sunday, the worst team in the league can beat the best team in the league, and the best team doesn't take it seriously and doesn't bring their A-game.
[02:01:34.103 --> 02:01:35.764]  We need to bring our A-game.
[02:01:35.764 --> 02:01:45.671]  We need to get motivated as the Trump base to get out there and vote, and not only for us to get out and vote, but to get other people of like mind to go out and vote.
[02:01:45.671 --> 02:01:49.213]  And we need to emphasize in these congressional elections, okay?
[02:01:49.213 --> 02:01:51.695]  For instance, the one in PA-16, okay?
[02:01:51.695 --> 02:01:53.176]  Saccone wasn't a sexy candidate.
[02:01:53.656 --> 02:01:58.178]  You know, he wasn't a candidate that thrilled or inspired, but I tell you what, he was a vote for the Trump agenda.
[02:01:58.178 --> 02:02:01.520]  And Lamb was a vote against the Trump agenda.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:05.822]  They kind of sold him a pick and a poke out there to the good people of Pennsylvania 18.
[02:02:05.822 --> 02:02:12.626]  But we need to say to people, you know, even if you don't know the name of the person who's running in your district, find it out.
[02:02:12.626 --> 02:02:14.467]  But if you get in the voting booth and you're like,
[02:02:15.147 --> 02:02:16.308]  Who should I vote for?
[02:02:16.308 --> 02:02:19.011]  Vote for the R. Because it's going to be a vote for the Trump.
[02:02:19.011 --> 02:02:19.932]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:02:19.932 --> 02:02:36.326]  But it shows we're winning, that the leftist candidates, they're trying to get rid of Pelosi, they're trying to get rid of all these other dead wood, and now they're trying to get rid of Hillary, and now you look at the CIA leftist arm is running like 50 candidates for Congress, and they're all little pretty boy trying to sound like Trump.
[02:02:36.326 --> 02:02:37.567]  I mean, these are spies.
[02:02:38.668 --> 02:02:44.432]  In our government, globalist operatives trying to pose as patriots with no bona fides, no history.
[02:02:44.432 --> 02:02:48.715]  So absolutely, vote for no Democrats, period.
[02:02:48.715 --> 02:02:52.678]  It's the beauty of a guy like putting a guy like Lamb up.
[02:02:52.678 --> 02:02:55.760]  He's got no track record, no voting record.
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:00.404]  He's a clean slate, so people can write on him whatever they want, and that's what they did with Barack Obama.
[02:03:00.404 --> 02:03:04.987]  But you can see the smart look on his face and how he is such a little arrogant Eddie Haskell.
[02:03:06.485 --> 02:03:07.646]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:07.646 --> 02:03:08.887]  Well, this is what they do.
[02:03:08.887 --> 02:03:11.709]  You know, they like to bring their messiahs, their saviors along.
[02:03:11.709 --> 02:03:13.910]  But we need to outwork these guys.
[02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:15.191]  We need to outwork these guys.
[02:03:15.191 --> 02:03:18.273]  And we need to be on the phones.
[02:03:18.273 --> 02:03:20.174]  Find out who your local representatives are.
[02:03:20.174 --> 02:03:21.275]  Volunteer.
[02:03:21.275 --> 02:03:22.095]  Donate.
[02:03:22.095 --> 02:03:23.596]  Go out there and knock on doors.
[02:03:23.596 --> 02:03:25.738]  Put door hangers out there.
[02:03:25.738 --> 02:03:27.519]  We need to outwork them on the ground.
[02:03:27.519 --> 02:03:30.781]  Exactly, because in 14 months, we've already seen things turn around a lot.
[02:03:30.781 --> 02:03:34.284]  But we've got to now save this win, because this is the counterattack.
[02:03:34.284 --> 02:03:36.405]  The motivated, arrogant slugs are now motivated.
[02:03:37.846 --> 02:03:41.208]  Yeah, well, like I said, it's an extinction-level event.
[02:03:41.208 --> 02:03:52.957]  I mean, if we can take a supermajority in the Senate, and it's possible, because we have at least 10 senators that are in states that Trump won easily, and Trump is polling very well in those states right now, okay?
[02:03:52.957 --> 02:03:54.598]  A lot of those are big time at risk.
[02:03:54.598 --> 02:04:00.562]  As a matter of fact, you have Democrat senators right now in some of these states who all voted against tax reform, which is a tremendous strategic mistake on their part.
[02:04:01.262 --> 02:04:05.786]  And they're actually running 10 to 15 points behind an unnamed candidate.
[02:04:05.786 --> 02:04:10.230]  It's like, you know, they haven't named a candidate yet, and the Democrat is already running behind.
[02:04:10.230 --> 02:04:16.755]  So, yeah, this thing with PA15, PA18, I'm sorry, they're not going to be able to replicate that elsewhere.
[02:04:16.755 --> 02:04:21.559]  If the Democrats were full of guys like Lamb, they'd be in better shape, but they're not.
[02:04:21.559 --> 02:04:24.962]  Also, they could take a few special elections and target everything.
[02:04:24.962 --> 02:04:26.584]  They can't when there's hundreds of them happening.
[02:04:31.887 --> 02:04:33.147]  They're not raising money.
[02:04:33.147 --> 02:04:34.007]  They're dead in the water.
[02:04:34.007 --> 02:04:36.148]  And I'll go further, Bill.
[02:04:36.148 --> 02:04:39.289]  You know the Republicans have found they flipped a bunch of machines, thousands of votes.
[02:04:39.289 --> 02:04:40.069]  He only lost by 600.
[02:04:40.069 --> 02:04:42.089]  So I don't think we should give this up.
[02:04:42.089 --> 02:04:44.710]  We should point out the election fraud.
[02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.090]  Oh yeah, we should point out the election fraud.
[02:04:46.090 --> 02:04:47.331]  In this case, you know what?
[02:04:47.331 --> 02:04:49.431]  I think the GOP wants to win that race.
[02:04:49.431 --> 02:04:51.892]  I think in Alabama, I think they didn't want more.
[02:04:51.892 --> 02:04:53.433]  And I think we saw a tremendous election fraud.
[02:04:53.433 --> 02:04:54.213]  Bill, we're out of time.
[02:04:54.213 --> 02:04:54.553]  Thank you.
[02:04:54.553 --> 02:04:54.913]  Amazing.
[02:04:56.018 --> 02:04:56.558]  Thanks.
[02:04:56.558 --> 02:04:57.019]  Alright then, thanks.
[02:04:57.019 --> 02:05:00.101]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[02:05:00.101 --> 02:05:04.064]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:05:04.064 --> 02:05:07.407]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:07.407 --> 02:05:08.487]  They are your- Thanks, okay.
[02:05:08.487 --> 02:05:09.989]  Talk to you later.
[02:05:09.989 --> 02:05:14.672]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:05:14.672 --> 02:05:17.014]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:05:17.014 --> 02:05:23.419]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:24.019 --> 02:05:32.228]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:32.228 --> 02:05:37.273]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:05:37.273 --> 02:05:44.260]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[02:05:44.921 --> 02:05:49.822]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[02:05:49.822 --> 02:05:52.723]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:11.309 --> 02:06:15.890]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:22.812]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:22.812 --> 02:06:31.875]  Alright, Ted Malek is going to be joining us, former head of the Davos Group, on the board of the Davos Group, Aspen Institute, you name it, but a patriot.
[02:06:32.942 --> 02:06:34.764]  An anti-globalist inside the globalist camp.
[02:06:34.764 --> 02:06:37.426]  We're going to break down Trump, what's currently happening.
[02:06:37.426 --> 02:06:43.030]  We're also going to open the phones up and take some of your phone calls.
[02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:46.193]  And is that from Space Command?
[02:06:46.193 --> 02:06:48.655]  Is that going to be joining us?
[02:06:48.655 --> 02:06:51.077]  I wasn't sure if he was coming on today.
[02:06:51.077 --> 02:06:53.078]  If not, it'll be tomorrow.
[02:06:53.078 --> 02:06:53.999]  Okay, yeah.
[02:06:53.999 --> 02:06:56.181]  Alright, so I'm going to get what's happening with the Pentagon there.
[02:06:57.790 --> 02:07:02.653]  We're gonna go to Ted Malik right now and then we're getting Roger Stone on the phone.
[02:07:02.653 --> 02:07:15.742]  He texted me about 10 minutes ago with huge breaking news dealing with Fiona Hill, the George Soros operative that we exposed last year that is involved with McMaster and everybody.
[02:07:15.742 --> 02:07:25.629]  And just as Roger said in January that basically Rex Tillerson had already been fired and a lot of his duties and power stripped by the president that he would be removed in March.
[02:07:25.629 --> 02:07:27.110]  You saw that happen exactly as we said.
[02:07:28.050 --> 02:07:32.655]  We also broke it was a pressure bomb, very primitive bombs, used a bomb in Austin yesterday, that's now in the news today.
[02:07:32.655 --> 02:07:35.938]  So I'm just telling you, we have the real sources.
[02:07:35.938 --> 02:07:49.071]  And this Fiona Hill individual is the Soros operative in the White House with McMaster, and that Trump is really angry and is looking to remove them both.
[02:07:50.199 --> 02:07:58.321]  POTUS is pissed at McMaster for speaking to Susan Rice and defending her public ally reported on InfoWars at the time.
[02:07:58.321 --> 02:08:10.644]  I just learned that the, I can't read this part, is none other than the Deputy Fiona Hill towards Soros, InfoWars exposed and how bad she was and how terrible it was that she was in the White House working for McMaster.
[02:08:10.644 --> 02:08:15.245]  So Trump is really cleaning house and now Roger has got a chance to talk to the White House.
[02:08:16.145 --> 02:08:16.365]  I think?
[02:08:32.975 --> 02:08:42.844]  Covering up for Hillary, lying to Congress, lying to the FBI director, lying to the Justice Department head, and now they're looking to fire him, I guess, ahead of criminal charges.
[02:08:42.844 --> 02:08:46.867]  So we'll go to Roger here in just a moment, as soon as we get him.
[02:08:46.867 --> 02:08:49.830]  Ted Malik, at this point in history, what's your intel?
[02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:53.353]  I know you've got a lot of high-level sources.
[02:08:53.353 --> 02:08:59.078]  Well, I think what we have is the globalists coming to power, finally, in the White House.
[02:08:59.941 --> 02:09:11.325]  So Steve Bannon's admission to the original sin of bringing in the establishment and the globalist part of the Republican Party has proven problematic.
[02:09:11.325 --> 02:09:19.087]  And now finally Trump is taking it back and he's removing those people, excising those people from his administration.
[02:09:19.087 --> 02:09:20.588]  I think that's very clear.
[02:09:21.377 --> 02:09:26.922]  Uh, in the case of the Secretary of State, which, you know, many of us predicted three, four months ago, I did when I was on your show.
[02:09:26.922 --> 02:09:32.267]  Uh, we have Pompeo, who is certainly completely aligned with the president.
[02:09:32.267 --> 02:09:38.332]  Uh, you know, it's basically a Tea Party congressman coming in as Secretary of State.
[02:09:38.332 --> 02:09:42.976]  We've got a woman who's tough on terror coming in to head the CIA.
[02:09:42.976 --> 02:09:45.659]  We should be very pleased by Pompeo.
[02:09:46.809 --> 02:09:47.870]  We should be very pleased.
[02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:48.730]  He's the real thing.
[02:09:48.730 --> 02:10:09.486]  And on the economic side, which is my normal beat, we've got Larry Kudlow, who is very well known, you know, a Reagan supply-side economist, obviously more free trade than some people in the White House like Peter Navarro, but he's coming around even on that position, and I think that's going to be a lovely relationship.
[02:10:09.486 --> 02:10:11.768]  Well, yeah, because I'm for free trade, but not when it's unfair.
[02:10:11.768 --> 02:10:12.829]  Wow, let's bring Roger Stone in.
[02:10:12.829 --> 02:10:14.610]  We'll continue with Ted Malek joining us from London.
[02:10:16.653 --> 02:10:21.897]  People are saying, oh my gosh, you know, Pompeo and this lady, the first woman head.
[02:10:21.897 --> 02:10:24.099]  Under orders of Obama, she ran black sites.
[02:10:24.099 --> 02:10:26.601]  You've got to arrest Obama if you're going to arrest her for this.
[02:10:26.601 --> 02:10:28.043]  Just grow up, folks.
[02:10:28.043 --> 02:10:30.104]  I'm against the torture.
[02:10:30.104 --> 02:10:31.005]  Ron Paul's against it.
[02:10:31.005 --> 02:10:32.466]  Rand Paul.
[02:10:32.466 --> 02:10:34.608]  Trump was openly for it because that's what goes on.
[02:10:34.608 --> 02:10:37.951]  Now he doesn't because the Secretary of Defense says it doesn't work well.
[02:10:37.951 --> 02:10:39.633]  More problems than it solves.
[02:10:39.633 --> 02:10:40.053]  I agree.
[02:10:41.474 --> 02:10:43.996]  Don't sit there on a high horse when Obama expanded torture.
[02:10:43.996 --> 02:10:45.616]  He didn't get rid of it and pointed this lady.
[02:10:45.616 --> 02:10:47.377]  But that's a side issue.
[02:10:47.377 --> 02:10:49.058]  You just heard what Ted Malik was saying.
[02:10:49.058 --> 02:10:49.959]  You've got big breaking news.
[02:10:49.959 --> 02:10:59.705]  We'll just have you for a few minutes, Roger, about what the shakeup in the White House is really about and that the president is finally on the warpath.
[02:10:59.705 --> 02:11:10.471]  Well, Alex, as you know, we reported exclusively here at InfoWars last year that the president was very unhappy with his
[02:11:11.306 --> 02:11:13.347]  National Security Director General H.R.
[02:11:13.347 --> 02:11:16.327]  McMaster's meeting with Susan Rice.
[02:11:16.327 --> 02:11:21.529]  And subsequently, by McMaster's public comments, appearing to absolve Rice.
[02:11:21.529 --> 02:11:23.149]  And you broke that three months before.
[02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:24.710]  In fact, give us the date.
[02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:30.331]  You broke here that at the very place he was, who he was having dinner with, he was drunk, talking tracks about the President.
[02:11:30.331 --> 02:11:32.072]  The New York Post was giving it, didn't run it.
[02:11:32.072 --> 02:11:34.472]  You broke it here three months later, it did break.
[02:11:34.472 --> 02:11:36.233]  Word for word what you said, so expand on that.
[02:11:37.128 --> 02:11:42.111]  So now we know, we also reported exclusively last year, that H.R.
[02:11:42.111 --> 02:11:53.697]  McMaster's top aide was a globalist named Fiona Hill, who we traced directly to George Soros and his Open Society Institute.
[02:11:53.697 --> 02:12:04.362]  Now we have learned that it was Hill who facilitated the conversation between McMaster and Rice that has gotten McMaster fired.
[02:12:04.362 --> 02:12:06.123]  McMaster is on his way out.
[02:12:06.829 --> 02:12:10.673]  This has been reported publicly, but we now know the reasons.
[02:12:10.673 --> 02:12:21.643]  Trump is furious about McMaster's conversation with Rice, but even madder that McMaster publicly absolved Rice in the unmasking scandal.
[02:12:21.643 --> 02:12:26.468]  Again, we here at InfoWars first identified
[02:12:27.208 --> 02:12:33.972]  Fiona Hill, the globalist, leftist, Soros insider who had infiltrated McMaster's staff.
[02:12:33.972 --> 02:12:41.516]  And that's why they're so panicked to get us off YouTube, off Google, off Twitter, openly suing us, Georgetown, Soros back, all of it.
[02:12:41.516 --> 02:12:43.957]  Because put the article on screen for TV viewers, please.
[02:12:43.957 --> 02:12:45.598]  We broke this word for word.
[02:12:46.358 --> 02:12:59.891]  In May 31st, 2017, bombshell Soros insider infiltrates Trump administration, then it was picked up by Newsmax, and then it was hand-delivered to the president at Mar-a-Lago, we can now reveal, back in the summer of last year.
[02:12:59.891 --> 02:13:01.112]  Ha ha!
[02:13:01.112 --> 02:13:02.633]  I mean, that's why they hate us, Roger.
[02:13:02.633 --> 02:13:02.974]  Go ahead.
[02:13:04.187 --> 02:13:05.407]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[02:13:05.407 --> 02:13:13.170]  You see, when McMaster spoke publicly absolving Rice, somehow those stories and clippings never got to the President.
[02:13:13.170 --> 02:13:16.351]  Well, when he did see them, he hit the roof.
[02:13:16.351 --> 02:13:23.454]  There's one thing Donald Trump despises above all else, and that's disloyalty, and he's clearly doing housecleaning here.
[02:13:23.454 --> 02:13:25.535]  Now, I like Mike Pompeo.
[02:13:25.535 --> 02:13:31.637]  I don't understand his ongoing criticism of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, but that aside,
[02:13:32.217 --> 02:13:37.764]  I do think he is more of an anti-interventionist than McMaster Cleek.
[02:13:37.764 --> 02:13:40.888]  He's an American firster and is in line with the president.
[02:13:40.888 --> 02:13:41.449]  That's what matters.
[02:13:42.421 --> 02:13:46.283]  Well, he was a member of the Freedom Caucus when he was in the House.
[02:13:46.283 --> 02:13:52.786]  He was tearing WikiLeaks on during the campaign largely because of their exposure of the corruption of Hillary Clinton.
[02:13:52.786 --> 02:13:54.427]  This is all about to turn.
[02:13:54.427 --> 02:14:07.814]  Let me remind you that Chairman Nunes sent a letter to Brennan, Clapper, Rice, and others with a deadline of March 2nd to answer questions about their involvement with the dossier.
[02:14:08.394 --> 02:14:13.857]  We don't know what they have responded, but I think we are about to have a volcanic eruption.
[02:14:13.857 --> 02:14:15.238]  How big is it, McCabe?
[02:14:15.238 --> 02:14:19.060]  The word is they're getting ready for criminal charges.
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:32.428]  McCabe is a centerpiece of the criminal conspiracy to utilize the fake dossier fabricated by a foreign agent in league with a bunch of Russians and utilize it
[02:14:33.334 --> 02:14:34.135]  As evident.
[02:14:34.135 --> 02:14:36.076]  McCabe is the chief perp.
[02:14:36.076 --> 02:14:43.721]  He's the guy who directed and approved the use of our tax dollars for payments to GPS hearings.
[02:14:43.721 --> 02:14:49.525]  Yes, is there any evidence that people are building that Mueller has rolled over the president?
[02:14:49.525 --> 02:14:53.128]  And we see some of these new indictments and these new files looking at Democrats.
[02:14:53.128 --> 02:14:59.993]  I mean, I don't think Mueller was with the president all along like something, but I think there's signs that he's starting to hedge his bets because no evidence was found in rolling.
[02:15:01.198 --> 02:15:10.565]  Well, it's possible that Mueller will bring a few relatively low-level indictments against Democrats, but we don't know that Mueller is McCabe's target.
[02:15:10.565 --> 02:15:13.587]  We don't know that McCabe has been targeted by Mueller.
[02:15:13.587 --> 02:15:20.572]  McCabe may be targeted by the Trump Justice Department and not the special... I think that's far more likely.
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:23.042]  Well, they're talking about that right now.
[02:15:23.042 --> 02:15:23.743]  Wow.
[02:15:23.743 --> 02:15:25.926]  Roger Stone, bombshell information.
[02:15:25.926 --> 02:15:30.411]  I'm going to come back from break and get Ted Malek's take on this, but just briefly with you then.
[02:15:30.411 --> 02:15:32.153]  What do we expect to happen with Fiona Hill?
[02:15:32.153 --> 02:15:33.475]  How long until she's out?
[02:15:33.475 --> 02:15:36.078]  How long until McMaster, the reported
[02:15:37.559 --> 02:15:39.520]  Alcoholic nincompoop.
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:46.222]  Reportedly, he's just a total nincompoop controlled by the neocons who can't find his ass with both hands.
[02:15:46.222 --> 02:15:49.083]  How long until these idiots are out of the White House?
[02:15:49.083 --> 02:15:49.723]  We'll be back.
[02:15:49.723 --> 02:15:53.785]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, TedMalik.com.
[02:15:53.785 --> 02:15:54.185]  Stay with us.

[02:17:56.618 --> 02:17:57.559]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:17:57.559 --> 02:17:58.140]  Good, brother.
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:00.082]  Just recently started using your products.
[02:18:00.082 --> 02:18:01.804]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[02:18:01.804 --> 02:18:05.828]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[02:18:05.828 --> 02:18:08.451]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[02:18:08.451 --> 02:18:10.713]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[02:18:10.713 --> 02:18:18.762]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[02:18:23.829 --> 02:18:26.734]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[02:18:26.734 --> 02:18:28.516]  They've made a ton of money there.

[02:18:34.565 --> 02:18:36.346]  Or maximum potency.
[02:18:36.346 --> 02:18:46.569]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[02:18:46.569 --> 02:18:48.370]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[02:19:28.157 --> 02:19:31.218]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:19:31.218 --> 02:19:32.578]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[02:19:32.578 --> 02:19:34.239]  My morning was fantastic.

[02:19:44.501 --> 02:19:45.522]  You will love it.
[02:19:45.522 --> 02:19:46.042]  I'm telling you.
[02:19:46.042 --> 02:19:47.682]  I've never bought a bad product.

[02:20:33.507 --> 02:20:34.888]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:55.441 --> 02:21:06.485]  That the moles were through a Soros operative inside of the White House, through McMaster, and is now culling the whole thing out.
[02:21:06.485 --> 02:21:18.189]  So just in two minutes, Roger, break down why these people are departing, why he's gotten rid of Cohen, why he's the Secretary of State, all of it, and get into this Soros operative lady that's the linchpin to it all.
[02:21:18.189 --> 02:21:21.690]  And again, you were saying the word is that McMaster is about to be toast.
[02:21:22.814 --> 02:21:25.455]  He's clearly next on the hit list, Alex.
[02:21:25.455 --> 02:21:33.278]  First of all, we cannot underestimate the importance of the appointment of Larry Kudlow as President's Chief Economic Advisor.
[02:21:33.278 --> 02:21:41.802]  Many believe Kudlow should have had this appointment from the very beginning, but the globalists working internally were able to block him.
[02:21:41.802 --> 02:21:42.522]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:21:42.522 --> 02:21:46.304]  You told me early on when he was President-elect that you were pushing Larry Kudlow.
[02:21:47.228 --> 02:21:49.431]  I was among those definitely pushing Larry.
[02:21:49.431 --> 02:22:01.664]  Larry Kudlow was the individual who helped the President formulate what was clearly the most dynamic and pro-growth of any of the Republican candidates' economic plans.
[02:22:01.664 --> 02:22:06.830]  In the tax cut, the President is following the advice and game plan laid out by Kudlow.
[02:22:07.586 --> 02:22:28.145]  Now, the president has finally thrown the globalist Goldman Sachs insider Gary Cohn, who boasted, by the way, that he could have had the same job under Hillary Clinton had she been elected, to the curb, and has brought in a real Trump supporter, a real Reaganite, someone who is committed to economic growth.
[02:22:28.145 --> 02:22:31.568]  This cannot be underestimated in terms of its importance.
[02:22:31.568 --> 02:22:33.130]  Now, in the foreign policy realm,
[02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:57.610]  If the President cashiers McMaster, who is always an odd fit given the fact that he came from a non-profit financed by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and yes, George Soros prior to his position in the White House, and replace him with someone who is a non-interventionist more aligned with Pompeo and the President,
[02:22:58.251 --> 02:23:01.592]  This will be a major, major internal coup.
[02:23:01.592 --> 02:23:11.475]  The President has the right to reassemble his hand, and he's doing so with some much, much better people.
[02:23:11.475 --> 02:23:15.196]  So, it took months for this to come to a head.
[02:23:15.196 --> 02:23:20.357]  How long do you think McMaster and Fiona Hill can stay in, and who else needs to be thrown overboard?
[02:23:20.357 --> 02:23:25.459]  Well, we know that the President first took note of Fiona Hill because of our reporting here at InfoWars.
[02:23:26.369 --> 02:23:35.977]  Now he's put two and two together and figured out, we've confirmed this this morning, that Fiona Hill was the one who engineered his communications with
[02:23:37.152 --> 02:23:51.601]  Susan Rice, the former National Security Advisor for Barack Obama, and the woman who ran the criminal unmasking operation and is knee-deep in the entire dossier fiasco.
[02:23:51.601 --> 02:23:54.303]  I believe McMaster's days are literally numbered.
[02:23:54.303 --> 02:23:59.586]  The real question will be whether or not he is replaced by somebody better.
[02:24:00.166 --> 02:24:08.048]  There is a major report by Jack Posobiec about a longtime John McCain associate who is maneuvering for this job.
[02:24:08.048 --> 02:24:10.968]  This is Washington intrigue at its very best.
[02:24:10.968 --> 02:24:26.652]  That's right, but now a direct pipeline to the Obama operatives that did the unmasking, the criminal spying, the lying, all of it, setting up the PPGate, all of it, the Stay Behind Network and the FBI Justice Department, a direct pipeline to them through McMaster and Fiona Hill,
[02:24:27.872 --> 02:24:33.256]  Right back to Obama, still trying to control policy from his office two miles away.
[02:24:33.256 --> 02:24:34.257]  Incredible.
[02:24:34.257 --> 02:24:36.479]  We'll get all of tomorrow's news today.
[02:24:36.479 --> 02:24:37.440]  Thanks to Roger Stone.
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:38.881]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:24:38.881 --> 02:24:42.884]  I'll be on The War Room at 5 Eastern today with an update.
[02:24:42.884 --> 02:24:45.125]  All right, let's go back to Ted Malinowski for the rest of the hour.
[02:24:45.125 --> 02:24:45.926]  Ted, thanks for sitting there.
[02:24:45.926 --> 02:24:49.128]  We have that breaking news, but I'm sure you can dial into all that.
[02:24:49.128 --> 02:24:53.331]  We'll get into some other subjects in the next segment, but you're taking what you just heard.
[02:24:53.331 --> 02:24:56.634]  Well, as usual, Roger is absolutely spot on.
[02:24:57.302 --> 02:25:04.804]  I can tell you that it looks like Attorney General Sessions is actually going to fire McCabe tomorrow.
[02:25:04.804 --> 02:25:08.025]  And that will mean that McCabe will not get his large U.S.
[02:25:08.025 --> 02:25:09.286]  government pension.
[02:25:09.286 --> 02:25:11.967]  In other words, he'll get the justice he deserves.
[02:25:11.967 --> 02:25:16.528]  Fiona Hill is likely to be out on her ass in the next day or two.
[02:25:16.528 --> 02:25:18.669]  McMaster may have 30 days left.
[02:25:18.669 --> 02:25:22.530]  We all know his time is like the clock, it's ticking away.
[02:25:23.248 --> 02:25:27.910]  Trump is actually interviewing, as Roger suggests, people for that position.
[02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:35.492]  I'm told he's talked to a couple of generals, and I know personally he's talking and has talked to John Bolton, among others.
[02:25:35.492 --> 02:25:39.613]  So, this is really a period of deep change in the White House.
[02:25:39.613 --> 02:25:46.736]  I don't think this is ever going to end until Trump gets what he wants and the people he wants in those slots.
[02:25:46.736 --> 02:25:48.356]  But we can't be too confident.
[02:25:48.356 --> 02:25:51.097]  How will the globalists strike back with all this Stormy Daniels crap?
[02:25:53.883 --> 02:25:57.386]  Well, I think I can be put to the side.
[02:25:57.386 --> 02:26:01.810]  That's just a kind of infatuation of CNN.
[02:26:01.810 --> 02:26:07.455]  I guess it's now a pornography network, as well as a so-called fake news network.
[02:26:07.455 --> 02:26:09.137]  I mean, the bigger story for me, Alex,
[02:26:09.727 --> 02:26:17.595]  And one I know you and your readers and listeners are very keen on is this story of the dossier, what I call The Plot to Destroy Trump.
[02:26:17.595 --> 02:26:19.477]  And indeed, I have a book coming out on that.
[02:26:19.477 --> 02:26:22.339]  It'll be out in the next 30 or 45 days.
[02:26:22.339 --> 02:26:31.088]  It basically puts all the dots together to tell this story about how the Democrats fashion, in fact, nothing less,
[02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:34.351]  And a coup d'etat of our President Donald Trump.
[02:26:34.351 --> 02:26:35.871]  And I read some excerpts to know what you're doing.
[02:26:35.871 --> 02:26:40.253]  This book is key for Congress and the media and everybody to have a blueprint for prosecution.
[02:26:40.253 --> 02:26:43.134]  This is way beyond the Nunes memo.
[02:26:43.134 --> 02:26:43.514]  Oh yeah.
[02:26:43.514 --> 02:26:47.755]  No, this is the big 30,000 foot view.
[02:26:47.755 --> 02:26:49.756]  It connects all of the dots.
[02:26:49.756 --> 02:27:00.620]  I've been researching it very confidentially and talking to all kinds of people for the better part of 60 to 90 days and we have been
[02:27:01.923 --> 02:27:11.706]  Pulling it together and I'm very happy to say I just saw the final type print and it's going to press.
[02:27:11.706 --> 02:27:14.167]  You know, I also know you're a theologian amongst your other degrees.
[02:27:14.167 --> 02:27:15.028]  What's the Bible verse?
[02:27:15.028 --> 02:27:18.649]  Well, look it up where you dig a pit for your brother, you fall into it.
[02:27:18.649 --> 02:27:27.692]  I mean, you can really see how they built this whole thing to destroy Trump but basically just mirrored it off what they'd actually done and now they've stepped in a bear trap.
[02:27:30.407 --> 02:27:39.051]  Well, indeed, and this GPS Fusion firm, of course, the one that had the nefarious ideas, hired Christopher Steele.
[02:27:39.051 --> 02:27:56.738]  In fact, what I disclosed in this book, that this has not been, I think, discussed anywhere else, GPS Fusion also did work for one President, Barack Obama, when he was looking for opposition research on Mitt Romney.
[02:27:56.738 --> 02:27:57.659]  That's right, and
[02:27:59.002 --> 02:28:00.143]  We're going to go to break and talk about this.
[02:28:00.143 --> 02:28:02.124]  We're going to get some into Russia.
[02:28:02.124 --> 02:28:07.087]  What do you think about Trump going for this thing out of England and you're over there in England when we come back?
[02:28:07.087 --> 02:28:08.908]  Is there any truth to the Russians nerve gassing?
[02:28:08.908 --> 02:28:09.949]  I don't see any proof.
[02:28:09.949 --> 02:28:12.391]  So why would Trump launch all these sanctions and things?
[02:28:12.391 --> 02:28:18.935]  It seems like he's doing so many good things, but on this end, he's kind of buying in the whole neocon fever swamp.
[02:28:22.352 --> 02:28:39.636]  Well, there was a significant attack in this very lovely cathedral city, Salisbury in England, where a former GRU Soviet intelligence officer and his daughter were somehow affected with nerve gas.
[02:28:39.636 --> 02:28:42.877]  What the name of that nerve gas is, I think, has not been disclosed.
[02:28:43.613 --> 02:28:45.938]  The Brits call it Novichok, but we don't know what it is yet.
[02:28:45.938 --> 02:28:50.167]  Exactly, so I'm going to hear from you in England if there's any validity to this and where this is going.
[02:28:50.167 --> 02:28:53.013]  But Ted Malik, straight ahead, tedmalik.com, find all his books there.
[02:28:53.013 --> 02:28:53.894]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:55.919 --> 02:28:57.881]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:28:57.881 --> 02:29:03.206]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:29:03.206 --> 02:29:04.788]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:29:04.788 --> 02:29:13.156]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:29:13.156 --> 02:29:18.842]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:29:20.823 --> 02:29:23.104]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:29:23.104 --> 02:29:27.506]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:29:27.506 --> 02:29:29.687]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[02:29:57.796 --> 02:30:03.279]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:30:03.279 --> 02:30:04.119]  I take this.
[02:30:04.119 --> 02:30:05.260]  My family takes this.

[02:30:14.144 --> 02:30:18.788]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:30:18.788 --> 02:30:19.909]  I don't feel good.
[02:30:19.909 --> 02:30:23.672]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:30:23.672 --> 02:30:26.355]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:30:26.355 --> 02:30:32.160]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:35.122]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:30:35.122 --> 02:30:38.666]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:30:38.666 --> 02:30:40.908]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:30:40.908 --> 02:30:41.248]  I love it.
[02:30:41.408 --> 02:30:44.211]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:30:44.211 --> 02:30:45.212]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:45.212 --> 02:30:51.178]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:51.178 --> 02:30:53.060]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:30:53.060 --> 02:30:54.302]  It's a win-win.
[02:30:54.302 --> 02:30:55.263]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:56.849 --> 02:31:02.253]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:31:02.253 --> 02:31:05.095]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:31:05.095 --> 02:31:07.097]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:31:07.097 --> 02:31:12.101]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:31:12.101 --> 02:31:14.202]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:31:14.202 --> 02:31:15.483]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:31:15.483 --> 02:31:20.607]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:31:20.607 --> 02:31:23.970]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:31:24.110 --> 02:31:27.472]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:31:27.472 --> 02:31:30.474]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:31:30.474 --> 02:31:34.176]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:31:34.176 --> 02:31:41.080]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:31:41.080 --> 02:31:48.585]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[02:31:55.591 --> 02:31:59.954]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[02:31:59.954 --> 02:32:04.158]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:32:04.158 --> 02:32:10.864]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:32:10.864 --> 02:32:14.628]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[02:32:15.328 --> 02:32:34.825]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:32:35.385 --> 02:32:39.488]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:32:39.488 --> 02:32:50.737]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:32:50.737 --> 02:32:59.744]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[02:32:59.744 --> 02:33:02.426]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:08.134 --> 02:33:13.793]  Yeah, we're good.
[02:33:17.868 --> 02:33:19.009]  Big Brother.
[02:33:19.009 --> 02:33:20.810]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:20.810 --> 02:33:22.671]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:22.671 --> 02:33:24.393]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:24.393 --> 02:33:26.034]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:26.034 --> 02:33:31.998]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:31.998 --> 02:33:41.824]  Alright, Ted Malek as a former Davos board member, Inside the Globalist author, and he's on with us to talk about the big battle going on in the world.
[02:33:41.824 --> 02:33:43.045]  What's happening with the unelected EU,
[02:33:44.346 --> 02:33:46.707]  I was trying to kill Brexit.
[02:33:46.707 --> 02:33:54.111]  We were getting into, though, this former GRU colonel, this Russian intelligence operative who'd been in London for over a decade.
[02:33:54.111 --> 02:34:02.335]  He was out in the countryside, comes out of a little shop, little grocery store, and then he and his daughter are found nerve-gassed.
[02:34:02.335 --> 02:34:04.536]  They say something like VX, they won't say what.
[02:34:04.536 --> 02:34:07.137]  And then they're like, we're sure it's the Russians, we're sure it's the Russians.
[02:34:07.137 --> 02:34:08.758]  Why would the Russians do this?
[02:34:10.390 --> 02:34:14.576]  When it lets England and everybody do sanctions and then Trump launches sanctions.
[02:34:14.576 --> 02:34:15.818]  We need Russian resources.
[02:34:15.818 --> 02:34:17.941]  Russians Christian again.
[02:34:17.941 --> 02:34:19.503]  Russia's helped fight radical Islam.
[02:34:19.503 --> 02:34:20.865]  That's what Trump's instincts are.
[02:34:20.865 --> 02:34:24.650]  So I'm really worried about the neocons and all this.
[02:34:26.093 --> 02:34:29.135]  And, you know, Mueller and all the rest of it.
[02:34:29.135 --> 02:34:34.239]  I mean, I hope this isn't Trump going along with this because he wants to look tough on Russia.
[02:34:34.239 --> 02:34:35.420]  We've got all these articles here.
[02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:39.984]  This is saying this is like worse than during some of the worst parts of the Cold War.
[02:34:39.984 --> 02:34:42.966]  So Washington sanctions Russia, individuals and entities, U.S.
[02:34:42.966 --> 02:34:43.907]  Treasury.
[02:34:43.907 --> 02:34:46.208]  And we've gone over all of that.
[02:34:46.208 --> 02:34:50.392]  But just to say with no evidence, you know, we think you did this.
[02:34:51.824 --> 02:34:56.548]  And to kind of go along with, oh, the Russians influenced the election, there are Russian election companies.
[02:34:56.548 --> 02:35:04.455]  The Democrats are more famous than Republicans, and that's why 80% of the funding, even in the FBI's report, was Democrats going and hiring bot companies in Russia.
[02:35:04.455 --> 02:35:05.897]  Everybody's got these bot companies.
[02:35:05.897 --> 02:35:06.898]  They've bought them all over the world.
[02:35:07.694 --> 02:35:09.595]  To then, you see, get around election law here.
[02:35:09.595 --> 02:35:12.556]  If you do it here, it's under the Federal Elections Commission.
[02:35:12.556 --> 02:35:13.336]  I'm telling listeners that.
[02:35:13.336 --> 02:35:14.437]  I'm sure most of them know it.
[02:35:14.437 --> 02:35:16.838]  But you go to Russia, you go to South Africa, England.
[02:35:16.838 --> 02:35:18.759]  I mean, Russian bots were relatively small.
[02:35:18.759 --> 02:35:22.741]  They were involved in 80 percent, roughly, were pro-Hillary.
[02:35:22.741 --> 02:35:27.102]  And then they had anti-Trump demonstrations when he was a candidate, when he was president-elect.
[02:35:27.102 --> 02:35:28.503]  Michael Moore is the new one in New York.
[02:35:28.503 --> 02:35:30.104]  It doesn't mean Michael Moore is a Russian agent.
[02:35:30.104 --> 02:35:32.125]  He's a globalist dirtbag agent.
[02:35:32.125 --> 02:35:34.826]  So, the facts are, this is insane.
[02:35:35.606 --> 02:35:43.223]  And so now sanctions on Russia because they have companies that people can go and pay to push stuff on Facebook?
[02:35:43.223 --> 02:35:45.367]  I mean there are thousands and thousands of companies.
[02:35:47.426 --> 02:35:48.887]  In Texas, you can hire.
[02:35:48.887 --> 02:35:53.870]  There's hundreds in Austin that will push stuff on Facebook and Twitter for you and YouTube.
[02:35:53.870 --> 02:35:59.473]  So to say, like, if some Russian company hired an American company to push a candidate in Russia, does that mean the U.S.
[02:35:59.473 --> 02:36:00.294]  is involved?
[02:36:00.294 --> 02:36:14.323]  This is just crazy, and you've got the CIA, the leftists, you've got George Soros and Ukraine and Russia trying to overthrow their elections, and, you know, the CIA funded Rock Band Pussy Riot, and all this crap, and I just don't want a new Cold War with Russia.
[02:36:15.343 --> 02:36:16.523]  I don't, it's just stupid.
[02:36:16.523 --> 02:36:18.644]  And it's not because I'm a Russian agent.
[02:36:18.644 --> 02:36:20.825]  I'm an anti-globalist and I want nation states.
[02:36:20.825 --> 02:36:23.746]  And Russia deserves to get out of globalism itself.
[02:36:23.746 --> 02:36:30.888]  Like all these other countries, you know, they claim realignments in Spain, realignments in Catalan, realignments in Greece, realignments in Italy, Czech Republic.
[02:36:32.463 --> 02:36:42.250]  In Hungary, in Romania, in Poland, in Reykjavik, there in Iceland and in the Brexit is all Russian.
[02:36:42.250 --> 02:36:43.571]  Well, you know what?
[02:36:43.571 --> 02:36:45.192]  That's ridiculous!
[02:36:45.192 --> 02:36:49.454]  The Russians can barely even get the streetlights working all over across their giant country.
[02:36:49.454 --> 02:36:51.316]  I mean, this is a load of BS!
[02:36:52.156 --> 02:36:54.618]  Okay, the toilets are overflown in Moscow!
[02:36:54.618 --> 02:36:58.460]  They're trying to hold their crap together from George Soros and the globalists trying to raid him.
[02:36:58.460 --> 02:37:00.462]  I know you're an American firster, Ted Malik.
[02:37:00.462 --> 02:37:07.566]  You see the EU as the real authoritarian threat, with Juncker, the Nazi heir, saying, we'll break up America, we'll crush Trump a year ago.
[02:37:07.566 --> 02:37:08.967]  He isn't laughing now, is he?
[02:37:08.967 --> 02:37:17.653]  But they say it's anti-Semitic to say globalists by Trump, or you or I, when the Chinese dictator's the top globalist now, along with Juncker being number two, wouldn't you say?
[02:37:17.653 --> 02:37:19.054]  And then Soros being number three.
[02:37:19.054 --> 02:37:21.976]  I mean, is that an accurate statement as a big insider like yourself?
[02:37:23.337 --> 02:37:29.063]  The term globalism is just the counter to nationalism.
[02:37:29.063 --> 02:37:33.768]  It doesn't have any racial, ethnic, religious connotation whatsoever.
[02:37:33.768 --> 02:37:35.250]  So that's a total misnomer.
[02:37:36.094 --> 02:37:39.355]  I think we need a realistic view on Russia.
[02:37:39.355 --> 02:37:40.775]  We shouldn't have a benign view.
[02:37:40.775 --> 02:37:52.999]  We shouldn't view them as somehow either our ideal partner or in every way an attractive alternative, nor should we view them as radically evil.
[02:37:52.999 --> 02:38:01.021]  I mean, there have been a number of suspicious deaths in the UK, 14 to be exact, over the last period of time of Russians and Russian agents only.
[02:38:02.011 --> 02:38:06.560]  They do have an issue in the UK, in the Lovrenko deaths with polonium.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:07.802]  You really think that's the Russians?
[02:38:07.802 --> 02:38:12.551]  Because a lot of these are Rothschild fronts and others have come out in court who've served out their usefulness.
[02:38:13.615 --> 02:38:14.115]  Well, indeed.
[02:38:14.115 --> 02:38:15.956]  So we need to get behind it.
[02:38:15.956 --> 02:38:17.256]  We need to see the intelligence.
[02:38:17.256 --> 02:38:19.017]  We can't just point a finger.
[02:38:19.017 --> 02:38:22.098]  There are all kinds of rogue elements, even in Russia.
[02:38:22.098 --> 02:38:23.858]  There's organized crime.
[02:38:23.858 --> 02:38:26.339]  There are breakaway groups.
[02:38:26.339 --> 02:38:29.880]  Well, that's key, what you said, because I've studied the demographics and the political.
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:34.582]  Russia is just like the U.S., overrun with antifa, globalists, leftists.
[02:38:34.582 --> 02:38:40.664]  I mean, the idea that Russia is this monolithic evil force is just not what the demographics show.
[02:38:41.874 --> 02:38:45.719]  Well, you give them too much credit by painting them into this giant bear.
[02:38:45.719 --> 02:39:00.276]  They weren't, you know, the same superpower we were even during the Cold War, so just to suggest that, you know, when everything in Russia has been halved in this period since, that they are anywhere near being that kind of giant is just factually false.
[02:39:00.276 --> 02:39:01.017]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:39:01.457 --> 02:39:20.291]  What you predicted ten years ago, what the CIA connections we have predicted six, seven years ago, that Alex, it's all going to implode, nationalism is coming back, globalism is being abandoned, you know, the people want it, we're going to stop it, because there are big factions in the governments that are good, and the globalists now realize the countervailing winds here, that they're going into the winds.
[02:39:20.291 --> 02:39:25.395]  Why are you seeing such an explosion of nationalism and a rediscovery of capitalism worldwide?
[02:39:25.395 --> 02:39:26.116]  What's pushing it?
[02:39:26.116 --> 02:39:27.877]  Is it just purely the human spirit?
[02:39:27.877 --> 02:39:29.999]  Or what is the prime moving forces behind it?
[02:39:32.421 --> 02:39:35.303]  Well, I think there's a convergence of a number of things.
[02:39:35.303 --> 02:39:41.449]  The first thing is basically repudiation of what globalization and globalism has provided.
[02:39:41.449 --> 02:39:45.372]  So there's an economic travail and people are just dissatisfied.
[02:39:45.372 --> 02:39:48.214]  So globalism sucks?
[02:39:48.214 --> 02:39:49.576]  Yeah, to put it loosely.
[02:39:49.576 --> 02:39:52.138]  I mean, economically, it hasn't produced.
[02:39:52.876 --> 02:39:57.800]  Culturally, it has also ripped apart our societies, our families, our cultures.
[02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:01.203]  So people are repudiating it on that level.
[02:40:01.203 --> 02:40:04.686]  You talk about the spiritual realm, one that I'm keenly interested in.
[02:40:04.686 --> 02:40:10.571]  It's also in denial of everything that has to do with tradition, that has to do with our traditional religions.
[02:40:11.232 --> 02:40:14.134]  And people are motivated and moving back towards those means.
[02:40:14.134 --> 02:40:15.035]  That's my next question.
[02:40:15.035 --> 02:40:16.216]  You're making so many good points.
[02:40:16.216 --> 02:40:17.677]  I am not against the average liberal.
[02:40:17.677 --> 02:40:18.657]  I'm not against gay people.
[02:40:18.657 --> 02:40:19.378]  I don't care.
[02:40:19.378 --> 02:40:21.860]  Literally, I'm sick of them acting like I'm against them.
[02:40:21.860 --> 02:40:25.682]  But the leftist and MSNBC, they all say they hate families.
[02:40:25.682 --> 02:40:26.723]  They hate Christians.
[02:40:26.723 --> 02:40:30.526]  They come over and they see I have my family and they go, F your family.
[02:40:30.526 --> 02:40:33.368]  Or I thought you lost your family in this whole custody battle.
[02:40:33.368 --> 02:40:34.649]  And they try to celebrate
[02:40:35.930 --> 02:40:43.881]  They try to celebrate that I'm this loser, and other conservatives I know say no, liberals tell them that, you know, how long is it until your family's broken up?
[02:40:43.881 --> 02:40:47.826]  Why do they hate families so much?
[02:40:47.826 --> 02:40:48.547]  Well, because...
[02:40:49.435 --> 02:40:58.103]  Since biblical times, or before that actually, in Aristotle, if you read Aristotle, you realize that the family is the building block of society.
[02:40:58.103 --> 02:41:03.067]  It's one of the key intermediating factors between the individual and the state.
[02:41:03.067 --> 02:41:06.290]  If you don't have strong families, the state usurps all power.
[02:41:06.930 --> 02:41:13.955]  And actually displaces then every other institution, and we're left with nothing but a monolithic grey state.
[02:41:13.955 --> 02:41:14.835]  That's right.
[02:41:14.835 --> 02:41:17.377]  The family is the base unit of humanity.
[02:41:17.377 --> 02:41:20.679]  You take that, the people fall.
[02:41:20.679 --> 02:41:22.200]  And they want to eradicate that.
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:34.869]  So I wrote a piece, you know, it was very controversial, I guess it was last year, appeared in Brightbutt, suggesting on research that 17 of the current EU leaders have no children.
[02:41:35.615 --> 02:41:40.696]  Is that just a surprise, or is that actually a commitment?
[02:41:40.696 --> 02:41:49.819]  Do they want us, in fact, to have no children, to have no families, to have no extended families, so that they can control us?
[02:41:49.819 --> 02:42:05.223]  That's right, and people aren't mad that they don't have children, but when you look at 25 states and 17 don't have kids, and people walk up at Whole Foods and say you shouldn't have 3 or 4 kids, I just think they're miserable people that are so selfish, they see us and they just want to pull it down.
[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:13.389]  It's a very, very sad mentality, but that's where the left in the globalist world has taken us.
[02:42:14.936 --> 02:42:20.099]  And, you know, to some extent, this battle is still being fought day in and day out in Europe.
[02:42:20.099 --> 02:42:31.305]  It's by no means won, even though we can celebrate the Italian victories last week, and we can look to the next election in the next European country up and coming.
[02:42:31.305 --> 02:42:38.289]  And we can say in 2019, hopefully the European Union will, you know, be a fraction of its former self.
[02:42:38.968 --> 02:42:50.821]  And that there's a chance that some of those power blocks will fall, that Germany is in fact itself, even though with its new grand coalition government, you know, inwardly focused and no longer able to pull over.
[02:42:50.821 --> 02:42:51.282]  That's right.
[02:42:51.282 --> 02:42:54.566]  Chad Malik, when we come back, let's talk about an even bigger issue.
[02:42:55.563 --> 02:42:59.167]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:42:59.167 --> 02:43:00.950]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:43:00.950 --> 02:43:12.223]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:43:12.984 --> 02:43:22.175]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:43:22.175 --> 02:43:32.728]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:43:33.228 --> 02:43:35.829]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:43:35.829 --> 02:43:37.569]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:37.569 --> 02:43:47.551]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:43:47.551 --> 02:43:50.212]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:43:50.212 --> 02:43:54.913]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:43:56.144 --> 02:43:56.944]  I'm so excited.
[02:43:56.944 --> 02:44:07.089]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[02:44:07.089 --> 02:44:15.613]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:15.613 --> 02:44:24.397]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200,
[02:44:26.479 --> 02:44:46.088]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:44:46.088 --> 02:44:48.749]  It is amazing!

[02:46:45.854 --> 02:46:47.295]  That means it's clean.
[02:46:47.295 --> 02:46:48.415]  That means it's pure.
[02:46:48.415 --> 02:46:51.317]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:46:51.317 --> 02:46:54.118]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:46:54.118 --> 02:46:59.181]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:46:59.181 --> 02:47:01.802]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.904 --> 02:47:30.706]  Burning inside from the front lines of the Information War!
[02:47:30.706 --> 02:47:39.808]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:39.808 --> 02:47:42.769]  What we are looking at is good and evil.
[02:47:44.794 --> 02:47:49.977]  950 ton pedestrian bridge collapsed about 20 minutes ago at Florida International University.
[02:47:49.977 --> 02:47:52.178]  Reports of multiple deaths and injuries.
[02:47:52.178 --> 02:47:54.339]  Our prayers go out to everybody and that's too bad.
[02:47:54.339 --> 02:48:00.163]  And I certainly, wow, just a prelude of a big earthquake out in California or Mount St.
[02:48:00.163 --> 02:48:02.765]  Helens blows up in Oregon or in Washington.
[02:48:02.765 --> 02:48:04.666]  But, should we ban bridges?
[02:48:05.950 --> 02:48:07.191]  Because you want to ban guns.
[02:48:07.191 --> 02:48:09.072]  Jihadis run over people with cars.
[02:48:09.072 --> 02:48:10.694]  Do you ban the cars?
[02:48:10.694 --> 02:48:17.199]  England keeps trying to ban butcher knives for making you get a license because they have a lot of knife crime.
[02:48:17.199 --> 02:48:19.200]  But see, a bunch of people die from bridge collapse.
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:21.742]  It's just out of the news in hours.
[02:48:21.742 --> 02:48:25.725]  But it's some craved person on a bunch of Prozac-type drugs.
[02:48:25.725 --> 02:48:29.628]  Well, it goes on forever and all gun owners are then to blame.
[02:48:29.628 --> 02:48:34.031]  So all of us that ever drove over a bridge, all of us that ever drove in a car,
[02:48:35.071 --> 02:48:44.818]  All of us that ever paid taxes for highways, we killed the people in Florida, according to that broken logic.
[02:48:44.818 --> 02:48:46.359]  And of course, we didn't kill them.
[02:48:46.359 --> 02:48:47.579]  We all know the world's a dangerous place.
[02:48:47.579 --> 02:48:49.501]  We're trying to make it as safe as possible.
[02:48:49.501 --> 02:48:53.283]  We know our infrastructure's in big trouble, like President Trump's been saying.
[02:48:53.283 --> 02:48:56.125]  If somebody built that bridge 10 years ago shoddily, prosecute them.
[02:48:56.125 --> 02:48:58.787]  Because there's no statute of limitations on murder.
[02:49:00.094 --> 02:49:06.722]  But think about how crazy that is when a jihadi... They're not talking about not letting people rent trucks in Europe.
[02:49:06.722 --> 02:49:10.546]  They've put up these freedom barriers everywhere where there's any public events because the jihadis will run over you.
[02:49:10.546 --> 02:49:11.527]  It's never how it's a Muslim!
[02:49:12.500 --> 02:49:14.001]  It's all about we don't have enough barriers up.
[02:49:14.001 --> 02:49:15.622]  So, that's just a side issue.
[02:49:15.622 --> 02:49:16.423]  A real tragedy there.
[02:49:16.423 --> 02:49:20.526]  Another article on Infowars.com and Newswars.com right now.
[02:49:20.526 --> 02:49:22.828]  In private, Dems panic over Pennsylvania win.
[02:49:22.828 --> 02:49:24.009]  Well, they stole the election.
[02:49:24.009 --> 02:49:25.290]  The GOP's confirmed.
[02:49:25.290 --> 02:49:26.931]  They flipped in a bunch of districts.
[02:49:26.931 --> 02:49:28.552]  Thousands of votes per district.
[02:49:28.552 --> 02:49:29.893]  Tens of thousands have stolen.
[02:49:29.893 --> 02:49:30.714]  They just flipped the votes.
[02:49:32.355 --> 02:49:33.575]  For the Democrat.
[02:49:33.575 --> 02:49:36.876]  But he wouldn't have had any hope if he hadn't posed as a Republican.
[02:49:36.876 --> 02:49:37.837]  So that's scaring him.
[02:49:37.837 --> 02:49:39.877]  There's a Kit Daniels article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:49:39.877 --> 02:49:43.199]  I want to ask Ted Malik, though, about how they're going to strike back.
[02:49:43.199 --> 02:49:44.779]  We're going to have him back up with his new books out.
[02:49:44.779 --> 02:49:45.979]  Look forward to carrying it.
[02:49:45.979 --> 02:49:46.920]  So that's the director of the crew.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:48.540]  I want to make sure we carry it in the bookstore.
[02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:49.140]  InfoWars.com.
[02:49:49.140 --> 02:49:53.702]  But I want to ask him, in closing, in the seven, eight minutes we have left, about
[02:49:54.952 --> 02:49:57.973]  How do we stop the plot to destroy the rebirth of this republic?
[02:49:57.973 --> 02:50:00.253]  Before we do that, I've got to fund our operation.
[02:50:00.253 --> 02:50:02.654]  And I do it by selling really hot products.
[02:50:02.654 --> 02:50:09.696]  Best water filtration, best air filtration, we have the Alexa Pure Breeze, Ion, 4-stage filter, HEPA, you name it.
[02:50:09.696 --> 02:50:14.537]  Leading competitors used to be about a thousand, now they're at about 500, because of the miniaturization of things that are happening.
[02:50:14.537 --> 02:50:15.177]  This is 150 with the
[02:50:18.518 --> 02:50:20.219]  Sale we're running, it's $50 off.
[02:50:20.219 --> 02:50:24.022]  And I can tell you, it's like 90 bucks for the unit.
[02:50:24.022 --> 02:50:27.404]  And so, we're making like 30 bucks, we're making like 30 bucks, whatever.
[02:50:27.404 --> 02:50:29.325]  You cannot get these better filters for your house.
[02:50:29.325 --> 02:50:32.226]  This will do a big room or two, get four or five of these for your house.
[02:50:32.226 --> 02:50:36.169]  When the red light comes on, it means it's gotten a little bit of dust, and you take that off the front filter.
[02:50:36.169 --> 02:50:37.790]  It's got four filters.
[02:50:37.790 --> 02:50:39.231]  It's amazing.
[02:50:39.231 --> 02:50:44.294]  Get your electric broom breeze today, $50 off the already lowest priced system.
[02:50:44.294 --> 02:50:44.974]  Out there, it can remove 99.9.
[02:50:46.895 --> 02:50:52.518]  Seven of airborne toxins and contaminants from your home, especially your children, you, everybody deserves this.
[02:50:52.518 --> 02:50:58.041]  We have Alexa Pure, Breeze, Pro-Pure, and other great water filtration systems as well.
[02:50:58.041 --> 02:51:00.702]  And we have our new Mico ZX Plus, even stronger.
[02:51:00.702 --> 02:51:05.565]  I signed a bigger contract with a top producer, so I get it for lower price and stronger.
[02:51:05.565 --> 02:51:06.846]  Totally organic.
[02:51:07.526 --> 02:51:10.528]  It is anti-yeast mold and fungus in the gut.
[02:51:10.528 --> 02:51:11.608]  It's great to have probiotics.
[02:51:11.608 --> 02:51:12.448]  We have those as well.
[02:51:12.448 --> 02:51:15.010]  Biome Defense and other systems that are really high quality.
[02:51:15.010 --> 02:51:15.810]  But that's for bacteria.
[02:51:15.810 --> 02:51:17.051]  To have good bacteria.
[02:51:17.051 --> 02:51:21.193]  This is to knock out the bad fungus, yeast, mold, the candida.
[02:51:21.193 --> 02:51:23.214]  And it's incredible, folks, what it does for people.
[02:51:23.214 --> 02:51:26.135]  Read the reviews at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:51:26.135 --> 02:51:27.396]  50% off, but not for long.
[02:51:28.615 --> 02:51:34.261]  Because it looks like it'll sell out in the next two weeks at that price, so I'm going to have to stop that in a few days and have to go back to regular price.
[02:51:34.261 --> 02:51:40.667]  Also, the fluoride-free 4 to 5 colloidal silver and iodine super blue has been sold out.
[02:51:40.667 --> 02:51:41.948]  It's now back in stock.
[02:51:41.948 --> 02:51:43.970]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:51:43.970 --> 02:51:45.292]  And 25% off Brain Force.
[02:51:45.292 --> 02:51:48.235]  Okay, going back to Ted Malek of TedMalek.com.
[02:51:48.235 --> 02:51:49.176]  Now, you heard my question.
[02:51:49.976 --> 02:51:50.837]  I don't know.
[02:52:10.526 --> 02:52:12.026]  My lawyers have looked at it.
[02:52:12.026 --> 02:52:14.967]  They say it is the biggest PR stunt they've ever seen.
[02:52:14.967 --> 02:52:16.708]  It would overturn the First Amendment.
[02:52:16.708 --> 02:52:17.888]  It's meant to drag me through the mud.
[02:52:17.888 --> 02:52:22.830]  They lie about what I said about what happened in Charlottesville.
[02:52:22.830 --> 02:52:24.850]  That's their model to ban things.
[02:52:24.850 --> 02:52:26.071]  We need to move against this.
[02:52:26.071 --> 02:52:27.571]  The President needs to move.
[02:52:27.571 --> 02:52:29.192]  You're an expert in these areas.
[02:52:29.192 --> 02:52:33.753]  What do you think we can do to stop the massive censorship rollout, the likes of which we've never seen?
[02:52:36.004 --> 02:52:48.190]  So the first thing we need to do, and you do it day in and day out, and there are others like you doing it in other places on the internet, and certainly not in mainstream media, that is expose the truth.
[02:52:48.190 --> 02:52:54.012]  There's nothing as powerful and as all eye-opening as the truth.
[02:52:54.012 --> 02:52:55.813]  So we have to fight the info war.
[02:52:55.813 --> 02:52:57.994]  We have to expose the truth.
[02:52:57.994 --> 02:52:59.215]  We have to bring those people
[02:53:03.519 --> 02:53:13.262]  I think we need, and this is, you know, Trump is already finding it difficult to do, but we have to, we have to defund and scale back what we call the deep state.
[02:53:28.294 --> 02:53:29.935]  We have to drain the swamp.
[02:53:29.935 --> 02:53:50.308]  That is an activity that is basically a full-time, all-out war, and there are all kinds of forces that mitigate against doing that, that make it difficult to do, both in the establishment right and in the left, who want to continue that deep state.
[02:53:50.308 --> 02:53:51.589]  We have to defund it.
[02:53:52.259 --> 02:53:57.967]  And I think the key thing we have to do in the long term is basically back Trump.
[02:53:57.967 --> 02:54:03.355]  I mean, I said nine months ago on BBC that Trump will run for re-election.
[02:54:03.965 --> 02:54:11.908]  That he'll be around for more than four years, and that the motto of that re-election campaign will be, Keep America Great.
[02:54:11.908 --> 02:54:13.828]  You did say that on this show!
[02:54:13.828 --> 02:54:15.469]  Man, don't make me say it.
[02:54:15.469 --> 02:54:17.189]  As a built-in assumption.
[02:54:17.189 --> 02:54:22.851]  In other words, that he will achieve in four years what he set out to do to make America great again.
[02:54:22.851 --> 02:54:24.532]  To take our country back.
[02:54:24.532 --> 02:54:28.333]  And in those next four years, we'll do everything to keep its greatness.
[02:54:28.333 --> 02:54:31.154]  To reassert American exceptionalism.
[02:54:31.824 --> 02:54:36.527]  So, I mean, that's a very tough agenda to do those four things I just mentioned.
[02:54:36.527 --> 02:54:41.711]  And it's going to take all of us working all time and overtime.
[02:54:41.711 --> 02:54:48.175]  Ted Malik, getting into the real sophisticated mode of international systems and politics.
[02:54:48.175 --> 02:54:51.698]  They always claim, oh, we don't want the left wing to get too powerful, the right wing to get too powerful.
[02:54:52.762 --> 02:54:59.124]  The globalists really just want exploitive, crony capitalist systems they control to vertically integrate and create a world of renters.
[02:54:59.124 --> 02:55:00.465]  They don't want competition.
[02:55:00.465 --> 02:55:03.006]  And that's their real crime, because it kills innovation.
[02:55:03.006 --> 02:55:10.949]  It creates a new serfdom, a new feudalism that hobbles not just the public, but the entitled so-called elites.
[02:55:11.889 --> 02:55:23.535]  But the argument of, we don't want the right wing and the populace to get too powerful, let's kind of wink-wink some in the Trump administration, let it get censored some, because it won't matter, they'll still have their speech.
[02:55:23.535 --> 02:55:27.117]  It's too powerful of the grassroots Tea Party.
[02:55:27.117 --> 02:55:29.238]  It's the left trying to extinct the balance.
[02:55:29.238 --> 02:55:32.800]  I don't even agree with this balance thing, and coming to the middle and all that.
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:35.281]  It's the left going for broke with authoritarianism.
[02:55:35.281 --> 02:55:39.303]  It's got to be extinguished when it comes to them being able to censor and block people.
[02:55:39.303 --> 02:55:40.184]  You can't just let them...
[02:55:41.024 --> 02:55:41.384]  I think so.
[02:56:00.523 --> 02:56:06.887]  When these executives and their minions are making fun of people's free speech and saying, will we ban Alex Jones and anybody with an American flag?
[02:56:06.887 --> 02:56:13.311]  I mean, there's a real America hate by all these tech minions and they need to then go somewhere outside the U.S.
[02:56:13.311 --> 02:56:14.271]  if they hate it so much.
[02:56:14.271 --> 02:56:17.734]  I don't understand why what's made them so powerful they hate.
[02:56:17.734 --> 02:56:22.557]  I mean, what is that?
[02:56:22.557 --> 02:56:27.840]  Well, they are a combination of socialists when it comes to social party.
[02:56:28.639 --> 02:56:32.921]  Social politics and they are largely transnationalists.
[02:56:32.921 --> 02:56:35.703]  They're globalists and they don't believe in America.
[02:56:35.703 --> 02:56:38.284]  They don't believe in American exceptionalism.
[02:56:38.284 --> 02:56:39.825]  They don't believe in markets.
[02:56:39.825 --> 02:56:41.646]  They want to have a monopoly.
[02:56:41.646 --> 02:56:42.967]  They don't want to pay taxes.
[02:56:42.967 --> 02:56:49.270]  You see them moving to places like Ireland and lower rent places so that they don't have to pay American taxes.
[02:56:49.270 --> 02:56:51.972]  And they're trying to basically keep
[02:56:53.071 --> 02:57:00.973]  Conservative points of view, right-of-center points of view, off the airwaves, off the internet, and to censor the freedom of speech.
[02:57:00.973 --> 02:57:05.414]  And now they're censoring prominent liberals that say, hey, we should be free speech.
[02:57:05.414 --> 02:57:07.054]  They're banning them off YouTube and Twitter.
[02:57:07.054 --> 02:57:09.055]  I mean, this is going to end up being everybody.
[02:57:09.055 --> 02:57:10.055]  I hope they understand that.
[02:57:10.055 --> 02:57:11.675]  Ted Malik, tedmalik.com.
[02:57:11.675 --> 02:57:14.816]  Look forward to talking to you in about a month or so when your new book comes out.
[02:57:14.816 --> 02:57:15.356]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:17.660]  Great, thanks Alex.
[02:57:17.660 --> 02:57:23.182]  Alright, I'm going to get out of here right now because the fourth hour is about to start with Anthony Cumia, who always knocks it out of the park.
[02:57:23.182 --> 02:57:37.227]  There's some big things I didn't get into, like the big anti-gun rallies where people like our good friend from Vermont had bodyguards with guns, but we can't have guns, Bernie Sanders.
[02:57:37.227 --> 02:57:42.029]  I get guns and bodyguards, but you, you don't, like the Soviet Union!
[02:57:42.029 --> 02:57:44.770]  I'm in the government, I have guns, you don't, little people!
[02:57:45.563 --> 02:57:47.465]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:57:47.465 --> 02:57:48.705]  Go ahead.
[02:57:48.705 --> 02:57:50.627]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:57:50.627 --> 02:58:01.135]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:58:01.135 --> 02:58:04.478]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:58:04.938 --> 02:58:05.238]  Absolutely.
[02:58:27.735 --> 02:58:40.650]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:58:46.403 --> 02:58:57.867]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[02:58:57.867 --> 02:59:06.791]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[02:59:07.011 --> 02:59:15.738]  Powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in flora life, advanced restoration.
[02:59:15.738 --> 02:59:20.762]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, flora life everyday maintenance.
[02:59:20.762 --> 02:59:31.050]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[02:59:31.050 --> 02:59:36.434]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[02:59:36.894 --> 02:59:50.101]  When you purchase it at InfoWarsStore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:59:50.101 --> 02:59:59.046]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.046 --> 03:00:02.988]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:00:05.601 --> 03:00:13.588]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:13.588 --> 03:00:17.131]  We now take you live to the fight.
[03:00:17.131 --> 03:00:26.420]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.420 --> 03:00:26.540]  And...
[03:00:27.674 --> 03:00:30.295]  Anthony Comey, a syndicated radio host, the head of Compound Media.
[03:00:30.295 --> 03:00:37.218]  He's going to be taking over here in just a few minutes, but I wanted to play these clips because I didn't get to it during my three hours and I just have to get to this.
[03:00:37.218 --> 03:00:38.819]  Bernie Sanders!
[03:00:38.819 --> 03:00:42.841]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[03:00:42.841 --> 03:00:47.783]  And I did my honeymoon in the 70s when you had to be a KGB operative to go to Russia.
[03:00:47.783 --> 03:00:51.705]  I got married in Russia to go see what it's really like to stand in line.
[03:00:52.365 --> 03:00:55.387]  For maybe a week to get some sausages or something.
[03:00:55.387 --> 03:01:01.091]  And I'm on record when I go to the store and I go, you don't need 30 types of deodorant.
[03:01:01.091 --> 03:01:04.473]  You don't need... Well, I guess you're under Soviet stuff.
[03:01:04.473 --> 03:01:05.653]  You never got strawberries.
[03:01:05.653 --> 03:01:09.076]  But the point is, I mean, that's the guy is a whack job.
[03:01:09.076 --> 03:01:10.717]  I bankrupt colleges.
[03:01:10.717 --> 03:01:12.698]  I drive two or $300,000 cars.
[03:01:12.698 --> 03:01:14.179]  I got five houses.
[03:01:14.179 --> 03:01:15.099]  One of them is $2 million.
[03:01:15.099 --> 03:01:18.962]  But you need to give me your money.
[03:01:19.764 --> 03:01:26.589]  So, he shows up to these anti-gun deals with a bunch of other Democrats with armed guards around him.
[03:01:26.589 --> 03:01:28.510]  That's how it is in the Soviet Union.
[03:01:28.510 --> 03:01:31.132]  I'm an important person.
[03:01:31.132 --> 03:01:32.353]  I get to have armed guards.
[03:01:32.353 --> 03:01:38.517]  You know little people, little people don't know what it's like to be able to be defended.
[03:01:38.517 --> 03:01:40.259]  He just does this like he's Moses.
[03:01:40.259 --> 03:01:41.620]  He's like the Messiah.
[03:01:41.620 --> 03:01:43.161]  Oh, he's handy.
[03:01:43.161 --> 03:01:45.262]  Oh, he's got a little gray hair.
[03:01:45.262 --> 03:01:45.963]  It means he's smart.
[03:01:47.011 --> 03:01:48.751]  So here it is!
[03:01:48.751 --> 03:01:52.473]  Here it is!
[03:01:52.473 --> 03:02:00.655]  I want to thank young people for having courage to do what Congress is not doing, but let's show it with the armed guards.
[03:02:00.655 --> 03:02:03.636]  For radio listeners, I'll have to tell you about it, but here's the video.
[03:02:03.636 --> 03:02:15.239]  I want to thank the young people throughout this country who have the courage to do what the United States Congress is not doing, and that is to lead us forward
[03:02:16.184 --> 03:02:20.187]  In a way, to lower the slaughter that we are seeing from coast to coast.
[03:02:20.187 --> 03:02:21.207]  Okay, so let's stop right there.
[03:02:21.207 --> 03:02:21.928]  Now let's go to the next one.
[03:02:21.928 --> 03:02:23.328]  That's him in the Senate.
[03:02:23.328 --> 03:02:24.029]  Here's Bernie.
[03:02:24.029 --> 03:02:26.230]  We need to end the so-called gun show loophole.
[03:02:26.230 --> 03:02:27.091]  That's private sales.
[03:02:27.091 --> 03:02:31.434]  You can give your son a gun, or when you die, I guess your wife can't have them.
[03:02:31.434 --> 03:02:33.715]  Calls for ending sale of assault style weapons.
[03:02:33.715 --> 03:02:34.736]  All semi-autos.
[03:02:34.736 --> 03:02:36.977]  But look closely in the shot.
[03:02:36.977 --> 03:02:38.758]  Here it is.
[03:02:38.758 --> 03:02:43.161]  We have got to end the so-called gun show loophole.
[03:02:44.215 --> 03:02:46.596]  We're gonna get these damn Americans to come and teach them!
[03:02:46.596 --> 03:02:57.242]  That means that people should not be able to buy weapons without going through a background check.
[03:02:57.242 --> 03:03:11.971]  And in my view, among many other things, we have got to understand that assault-style weapons, military weapons, are designed for one thing, and that is to kill people.
[03:03:21.866 --> 03:03:33.794]  I am absolutely delighted and proud that you are here today.
[03:03:33.794 --> 03:03:38.276]  What you are doing is of national significance.
[03:03:38.276 --> 03:03:41.538]  You're leading this country in the right direction.
[03:03:41.538 --> 03:03:42.259]  Thank you all.
[03:03:44.193 --> 03:03:48.156]  Again, there's the video, there's several of them, but there he is from different video shots.
[03:03:48.156 --> 03:03:51.738]  He had at least six police officers with guns around him.
[03:03:51.738 --> 03:03:53.420]  Shimmy automatics that he wants banned.
[03:03:53.420 --> 03:03:57.162]  And then of course, Eminem, you know, we'll play this next clip.
[03:03:57.162 --> 03:04:03.887]  It says the NRA's bad, the people introducing say this, but he's got a conviction for pistol whipping somebody with an illegal gun.
[03:04:03.887 --> 03:04:10.832]  Too dumb to even go out and get, you know, in his state the license, and most states don't even have a license, so to talk about a moron, here's Eminem.
[03:04:12.723 --> 03:04:16.306]  Yeah, people being, having guns as being not puppets.
[03:04:29.358 --> 03:04:31.059]  I'm gonna pistol whip ya!
[03:04:31.059 --> 03:04:32.720]  I got a gun conviction!
[03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:33.561]  Cuz I'm a criminal!
[03:04:33.561 --> 03:04:36.523]  I want you to not have a gun so I can have my way with ya!
[03:04:36.523 --> 03:04:38.024]  Cuz I got a small brain!
[03:04:38.024 --> 03:04:39.585]  And I'm a fake punk thug!
[03:04:39.585 --> 03:04:41.586]  And I'm the dumbest person in the whole world!
[03:04:41.586 --> 03:04:45.529]  Give me your guns!
[03:04:45.529 --> 03:04:46.230]  Give me your guns!
[03:04:46.230 --> 03:04:47.871]  Or I'll have him pistol whip ya!
[03:04:48.651 --> 03:04:50.872]  I got armed guards, but you don't!
[03:04:50.872 --> 03:04:52.593]  Eminem's a complete moron.
[03:04:52.593 --> 03:04:54.975]  The word is he's got like a 70 IQ, can't wipe his ass.
[03:04:54.975 --> 03:05:02.118]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[03:05:57.815 --> 03:06:04.056]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:12.074 --> 03:06:13.275]  Hello, everybody.
[03:06:13.275 --> 03:06:13.996]  Welcome.
[03:06:13.996 --> 03:06:15.677]  Anthony Cumia here.
[03:06:15.677 --> 03:06:19.441]  The honor of being in at Infowars.com.
[03:06:19.441 --> 03:06:30.751]  I was literally just wiping tears from my eyes from watching Alex doing his Eminem.
[03:06:30.751 --> 03:06:32.292]  It was hilarious.
[03:06:33.015 --> 03:06:35.696]  Who doesn't love Alex Jones?
[03:06:35.696 --> 03:06:36.976]  I read things.
[03:06:36.976 --> 03:06:40.256]  I read things on social media on a daily basis.
[03:06:40.256 --> 03:06:41.817]  I get all kinds of crap.
[03:06:41.817 --> 03:06:45.517]  What are you doing on InfoWars, Anthony?
[03:06:45.517 --> 03:06:47.578]  What are you doing?
[03:06:47.578 --> 03:06:51.259]  Alex Jones says that Martians are coming.
[03:06:51.259 --> 03:06:55.939]  It's like, oh my God, you've obviously never even watched the man.
[03:06:55.939 --> 03:06:55.979]  So
[03:06:59.711 --> 03:07:02.113]  Just damn entertaining, man.
[03:07:02.113 --> 03:07:03.034]  I'm crying.
[03:07:03.034 --> 03:07:05.836]  The impression... Alex has to take that on the road.
[03:07:05.836 --> 03:07:10.360]  His Eminem impression.
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:11.240]  Welcome!
[03:07:11.240 --> 03:07:15.444]  And again, I thank the fine people at InfoWars for having me on.
[03:07:15.444 --> 03:07:17.926]  Alex hit on it right at the end of the show right there.
[03:07:17.926 --> 03:07:20.888]  The gun issue.
[03:07:20.888 --> 03:07:22.009]  All the students...
[03:07:23.296 --> 03:07:31.400]  The anti-Second Amendment people, the people like Bernie, his Bernie impression was killing me too.
[03:07:31.400 --> 03:07:50.789]  Getting out there and saying that, oh boy, we need all the law-abiding gun owners, all those people that own guns, hundreds of millions of people, and hundreds of millions of guns, and we need them!
[03:07:53.564 --> 03:07:56.145]  We need to write new laws for them.
[03:07:56.145 --> 03:08:05.330]  You know, the people that haven't done anything wrong except legally own guns and exercise their Second Amendment right.
[03:08:05.330 --> 03:08:11.574]  Those are the people that we really have to take guns away from.
[03:08:11.574 --> 03:08:21.159]  The actual problems that we have, which I mean, anybody with an ounce of common sense over the past few decades
[03:08:21.821 --> 03:08:26.823]  has seen why we have issues like we do in this country today.
[03:08:26.823 --> 03:08:29.523]  The gun issue just being one of them.
[03:08:29.523 --> 03:08:30.824]  But we can see it.
[03:08:30.824 --> 03:08:34.825]  This has been gearing up for so long.
[03:08:34.825 --> 03:08:42.367]  I have called it, I don't know, I don't think this is a little too much for the air, the pussification of America.
[03:08:42.367 --> 03:08:44.648]  I think that's a big thing.
[03:08:44.648 --> 03:08:47.689]  Men, boy, young men not being allowed
[03:08:48.439 --> 03:08:59.409]  To actually be men, being emasculated by feminism and the politically correct.
[03:08:59.409 --> 03:09:06.716]  These are all things that have contributed to so many of the problems we have in this country today.
[03:09:06.716 --> 03:09:11.460]  And again, they just want to snatch away our rights.
[03:09:11.460 --> 03:09:12.942]  The Second Amendment is a great
[03:09:14.275 --> 03:09:17.137]  A great instance of this because it's so easy.
[03:09:17.137 --> 03:09:18.738]  It's an actual mechanism.
[03:09:18.738 --> 03:09:19.878]  It's a thing.
[03:09:19.878 --> 03:09:21.619]  You have to have a thing.
[03:09:21.619 --> 03:09:25.121]  It's not a pursuit of happiness.
[03:09:25.121 --> 03:09:30.924]  It's not the freedom of speech where just speaking is your right.
[03:09:30.924 --> 03:09:33.606]  You need an actual mechanism.
[03:09:33.606 --> 03:09:34.326]  A gun.
[03:09:34.326 --> 03:09:41.950]  So when you make the focus on taking that away, it sounds like you're just taking away a machine, an object.
[03:09:42.919 --> 03:09:53.266]  And it's so much easier to do that than it is to take away some other ideology that makes up a right.
[03:09:53.266 --> 03:09:55.587]  So you take the gun away, and people go, what?
[03:09:55.587 --> 03:09:58.029]  We're just limiting the guns.
[03:09:58.029 --> 03:09:58.829]  It's a thing.
[03:09:58.829 --> 03:10:01.091]  No, you're taking away a right.
[03:10:01.091 --> 03:10:05.514]  A right that is just as important
[03:10:06.428 --> 03:10:18.392]  And inalienable to us as Americans, as the freedom of speech, as the freedom to not have people bash your door in and go through your belongings.
[03:10:18.392 --> 03:10:25.734]  But like I said, when it's an actual mechanism, a thing, a tangible object, it makes it so much easier for these
[03:10:26.696 --> 03:10:29.797]  These people to try to take it away from you.
[03:10:29.797 --> 03:10:34.919]  We saw the schools had their their day walkout day.
[03:10:34.919 --> 03:10:37.319]  I remember these things when I was in school.
[03:10:37.319 --> 03:10:38.700]  Not for this.
[03:10:38.700 --> 03:10:44.942]  I remember like we walked out because we wanted smoking in schools.
[03:10:44.942 --> 03:10:48.583]  We wanted to be able to smoke in the schools.
[03:10:48.583 --> 03:10:51.364]  So we said, ah, we're walking out.
[03:10:52.140 --> 03:10:58.166]  And, uh, we walked out, we sat on the front lawn of the school, and we all lit up our cigarettes.
[03:10:58.166 --> 03:10:59.207]  Real cool.
[03:10:59.207 --> 03:11:05.653]  Alright, look, I know I'm no kid here, but, uh, I hear some of you out there going, what was playing?
[03:11:05.653 --> 03:11:07.976]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-dang-a-dang-a-dunk?
[03:11:07.976 --> 03:11:09.357]  No, it wasn't that long ago.
[03:11:10.333 --> 03:11:15.336]  But, uh, I believe, um, maybe Molly Hatchet and Charlie Daniels were playing.
[03:11:15.336 --> 03:11:21.259]  But we were out there on the lawn, and we're smoking our cigarettes, and we're sitting around, and we're going, yeah, man!
[03:11:21.259 --> 03:11:32.665]  We're gonna show the teachers and the principal, man, we're not going back in there until we, uh, till we get to smoke on campus!
[03:11:32.665 --> 03:11:35.887]  Well, the principal comes out, he's got a little bullhorn,
[03:11:39.003 --> 03:11:45.347]  Uh, anybody who isn't back in the school in three minutes is suspended.
[03:11:45.347 --> 03:11:49.750]  Your grades for this, you're gonna go down a grade.
[03:11:49.750 --> 03:11:53.072]  And all of these, whoa, we're gonna fight the math.
[03:11:53.072 --> 03:11:55.333]  Like, all right, we better get back in.
[03:11:55.333 --> 03:11:59.416]  I think social studies is starting.
[03:11:59.416 --> 03:12:04.439]  We weren't treated like precious little snowflakes.
[03:12:06.248 --> 03:12:11.433]  By the administration that we went to, when I went to school.
[03:12:11.433 --> 03:12:16.497]  And I hate sounding like that, but I guess that's why you always sound like, why you!
[03:12:16.497 --> 03:12:20.501]  Get off my lawn, you damn kids!
[03:12:20.501 --> 03:12:28.789]  But we've gotten to this point where everything a young person says is this gold nugget of knowledge.
[03:12:29.941 --> 03:12:43.192]  Everything a young person says is to be taken at 100% face value for being brilliant and amazing and we must listen.
[03:12:43.192 --> 03:12:49.136]  Sometimes, kids are just uninformed dopes.
[03:12:49.136 --> 03:12:51.999]  I'm not saying that's the instance here.
[03:12:51.999 --> 03:12:53.400]  I'm not picking any
[03:12:54.517 --> 03:12:58.318]  Is there a specific cause that they've rallied behind?
[03:12:58.318 --> 03:13:04.560]  I'm just saying, in my life experience, I have taken note that kids are usually stupid.
[03:13:11.025 --> 03:13:12.346]  I don't mean uneducated.
[03:13:12.346 --> 03:13:17.268]  You know, you could go to school, you could crack a book, you could learn, you could get good grades.
[03:13:17.268 --> 03:13:31.055]  But there is something that only life experience brings you that I am not seeing in the young people that are being hailed as heroic for going out and speaking.
[03:13:31.055 --> 03:13:34.436]  I mean, some of them are very articulate.
[03:13:34.436 --> 03:13:35.937]  Some of them have valid points.
[03:13:36.812 --> 03:13:47.474]  But every single young person that goes out and holds up a sign is not, you know, an Alvin Einstein.
[03:13:47.474 --> 03:13:49.674]  Yes, I did say Alvin.
[03:13:49.674 --> 03:13:52.695]  It's part of the joke.
[03:13:52.695 --> 03:14:00.036]  But the media just gets on them and hails every one of them as brilliant.
[03:14:00.036 --> 03:14:01.436]  Brilliant.
[03:14:01.436 --> 03:14:04.277]  And they just don't have life experience.
[03:14:05.513 --> 03:14:08.736]  And that's why for decades we have heard this.
[03:14:08.736 --> 03:14:17.866]  Decades of demonstrations and protests and high schools and college campus students getting out there and fighting the powers that be.
[03:14:17.866 --> 03:14:21.289]  And this gets brought up every single time.
[03:14:21.289 --> 03:14:27.336]  Well, you watch out because these are the people that are going to be voting in a few years!
[03:14:28.567 --> 03:14:37.111]  And it never really comes to fruition that this giant change happens because these young people grew up and now they're voting.
[03:14:37.111 --> 03:14:38.191]  You know why?
[03:14:38.191 --> 03:14:46.995]  Because they had a little bit more life experience and realized it was crap what they were saying most of the time.
[03:14:46.995 --> 03:14:49.496]  Utter and complete nonsense.
[03:14:49.496 --> 03:14:54.939]  They went out, they left school, they got jobs, they looked at their paycheck and went, WHAT?! !
[03:14:57.052 --> 03:15:04.500]  I remember I was protesting to give more of the workers money away to the government so they could help people.
[03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:08.324]  And I was supposed to be the guy that starts voting and changes everything.
[03:15:08.324 --> 03:15:11.708]  And then they get their paycheck and go, hey, screw that!
[03:15:11.708 --> 03:15:16.613]  They're taking all my work, 40 hours, and they're taking all my money.
[03:15:16.613 --> 03:15:17.775]  That's what happens.
[03:15:18.467 --> 03:15:26.917]  They don't grow up and remain the same naive little tykes that they were when they were protesting.
[03:15:26.917 --> 03:15:36.228]  They grow up and realize a lot of what I said was utter nonsense and I have been educated by the school of life.
[03:15:37.484 --> 03:15:46.908]  And it has changed my opinion and that's who I am now when I vote and maybe even run for office.
[03:15:46.908 --> 03:15:50.129]  We'll just see this happen over and over and over again here in this country.
[03:15:50.129 --> 03:15:51.409]  Be back in a moment!

[03:20:32.697 --> 03:20:34.318]  Um, my goodness!
[03:20:34.318 --> 03:20:36.180]  Hollywood!
[03:20:36.180 --> 03:20:38.261]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
[03:20:38.261 --> 03:20:38.762]  The, um...
[03:20:39.770 --> 03:20:44.732]  The Petri dish on the West Coast that is Hollywood.
[03:20:44.732 --> 03:20:47.233]  Boy, the glamour just kind of gone off of that.
[03:20:47.233 --> 03:20:52.655]  The Tinseltown shine that was once the amazing Hollywood.
[03:20:52.655 --> 03:21:00.698]  Here she comes, the lovely Greta Garbo at the premiere of her new motion pictures here at Grauman's Chinese Theatre.
[03:21:00.698 --> 03:21:05.460]  Remember the old glamour of Hollywood, the perception we had that
[03:21:06.696 --> 03:21:11.297]  It was just made up of these amazing people.
[03:21:11.297 --> 03:21:16.358]  Tinseltown, they called it, because it was so glittery and sparkly.
[03:21:16.358 --> 03:21:19.598]  We didn't know anything about the actors and actresses.
[03:21:19.598 --> 03:21:22.999]  We didn't want to know anything about the actors and actresses.
[03:21:22.999 --> 03:21:27.700]  They'd occasionally do talk shows or award shows.
[03:21:27.700 --> 03:21:33.981]  Like, you know, we all watch the Oscars and it just doesn't have that sheen on it that it used to.
[03:21:36.283 --> 03:21:38.665]  That those people were just amazing.
[03:21:38.665 --> 03:21:41.167]  They were just amazing.
[03:21:41.167 --> 03:21:42.909]  Put up on pedestals.
[03:21:42.909 --> 03:21:43.870]  Put up on pedestals.
[03:21:43.870 --> 03:21:46.372]  They were special.
[03:21:46.372 --> 03:21:48.354]  They were better than us.
[03:21:48.354 --> 03:21:49.655]  We could say it, people.
[03:21:49.655 --> 03:22:00.564]  Back in those days, watching Chuck Heston walking up to a podium, I'd like to present the next award for best actor.
[03:22:00.564 --> 03:22:02.046]  You're like, ah, that guy's better than me.
[03:22:03.661 --> 03:22:27.177]  And then with the advent of social media and the never-ending cry for attention that these attention whores have in Hollywood, they started spouting their ideology and their beliefs to us.
[03:22:27.177 --> 03:22:31.120]  It wasn't good enough that they were on our motion picture screens.
[03:22:31.120 --> 03:22:32.801]  When we'd go to the movie house,
[03:22:33.874 --> 03:22:39.918]  To see the latest movie by Robert Taylor!
[03:22:39.918 --> 03:22:42.139]  That was even before my time.
[03:22:42.139 --> 03:22:44.221]  But, you know, they were up there.
[03:22:44.221 --> 03:22:46.842]  They were on our TV screens.
[03:22:46.842 --> 03:22:51.105]  They were in our entertainment magazines.
[03:22:51.105 --> 03:22:53.427]  And that just wasn't enough for them.
[03:22:53.427 --> 03:22:54.087]  We didn't know this.
[03:22:54.087 --> 03:22:56.649]  There wasn't any other outlet years ago.
[03:22:57.951 --> 03:23:00.753]  When we didn't know about these actors and actresses.
[03:23:00.753 --> 03:23:02.974]  All we knew was what they wanted us to know.
[03:23:02.974 --> 03:23:07.477]  What their publicist or the studios would want us to know about them.
[03:23:07.477 --> 03:23:08.477]  So we didn't really know.
[03:23:08.477 --> 03:23:22.745]  And then social media, this thing comes out where everyone with any harebrained idea or ridiculous ideology or whatever it is, can now tell the world what they think.
[03:23:22.745 --> 03:23:24.106]  And Hollywood was no exception.
[03:23:25.534 --> 03:23:30.117]  The celebrities got on there and just started, here's what I think.
[03:23:30.117 --> 03:23:33.520]  Here's how you should live your life, people.
[03:23:33.520 --> 03:23:40.364]  And we looked, and we read, and we watched videos, and we said, wow!
[03:23:40.364 --> 03:23:44.086]  What a bunch of jerks!
[03:23:44.086 --> 03:23:45.688]  What a bunch of idiots!
[03:23:45.688 --> 03:23:49.430]  These, they're not, they're not special anymore.
[03:23:49.430 --> 03:23:52.152]  They're not better than us, are they?
[03:23:52.152 --> 03:23:53.733]  And since then,
[03:23:54.851 --> 03:24:10.380]  Uh, the Hollywood, the amazing glitter of Tinseltown has just been reduced to a petri dish that is with a bacteria culture in it.
[03:24:10.380 --> 03:24:12.641]  That's pretty much what Hollywood is now.
[03:24:12.641 --> 03:24:17.544]  A bacteria culture festering in a petri dish.
[03:24:17.544 --> 03:24:18.765]  There they are!
[03:24:18.765 --> 03:24:21.306]  The amazing stars of yesteryear!
[03:24:21.306 --> 03:24:23.828]  Ladies and gentlemen, making their way down the red carpet!
[03:24:24.682 --> 03:24:26.663]  A new motion picture!
[03:24:26.663 --> 03:24:28.303]  It's Marilyn Monroe!
[03:24:28.303 --> 03:24:31.485]  Let's give her a big hand!
[03:24:31.485 --> 03:24:32.405]  Here she is!
[03:24:32.405 --> 03:24:38.207]  Rumors have it, she's good friends with the Kennedys!
[03:24:38.207 --> 03:24:39.087]  What happened?
[03:24:39.087 --> 03:24:42.609]  There's the yesteryear actresses and the modern day.
[03:24:42.609 --> 03:24:44.129]  It's just a catastrophe.
[03:24:44.129 --> 03:24:48.071]  Well, but I digress.
[03:24:48.071 --> 03:24:49.731]  We all saw the Academy Awards.
[03:24:49.731 --> 03:24:51.632]  We saw Frances McDormand.
[03:24:52.706 --> 03:25:00.610]  Frances McDormand, she won an award for, uh, three billboards outside of blotty blotty blot.
[03:25:00.610 --> 03:25:11.136]  And, um, during her speech, she goes, we, well, we, uh, I give you two words, ladies and gentlemen, inclusion rider!
[03:25:11.136 --> 03:25:13.477]  And, uh, the people in the audience are like, woo!
[03:25:13.477 --> 03:25:16.399]  And everyone at home went, huh?
[03:25:16.399 --> 03:25:18.080]  What?
[03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:20.001]  You say inclusion rider, people go, huh?
[03:25:20.001 --> 03:25:20.201]  What?
[03:25:21.027 --> 03:25:24.109]  You say shark, we got a panic on our hands on the 4th of July.
[03:25:24.109 --> 03:25:27.051]  Uh, Inclusion Rider, no one knew what it was.
[03:25:27.051 --> 03:25:27.511]  Huh?
[03:25:27.511 --> 03:25:29.433]  What?
[03:25:29.433 --> 03:25:32.655]  So, uh, we learned what it was, simply put.
[03:25:32.655 --> 03:25:48.085]  It's a stipulation that actors and actresses can ask or demand, I demand of you, to have inserted into their contracts, which would require a certain level of diversity among the film's cast and crew.
[03:25:50.484 --> 03:26:16.444]  So the act, let me put this straight, the talking puppet head, the puppet head that recites the words that are written for them in front of a camera that's run by other people, on a set that's decorated by other people, on an entire production that's paid for by other people, can demand who they want running the equipment.
[03:26:17.377 --> 03:26:20.380]  And the rest of the surrounding cast around them.
[03:26:20.380 --> 03:26:25.384]  How pompous is this?
[03:26:25.384 --> 03:26:44.499]  Wouldn't you, if you're putting millions and millions of dollars into a motion picture, into a project, or, you know, think about it, anything, anything that you do, you're taking your money and you're putting it in, you want the best possible result from your investment.
[03:26:45.819 --> 03:27:00.468]  Do you want someone coming up to you and telling you who should be doing the job, by the way, based on nothing but their ethnic, sexual, or religious, uh, preferences?
[03:27:00.468 --> 03:27:02.249]  I'll tell you what I would say.
[03:27:02.249 --> 03:27:03.931]  Oops!
[03:27:03.931 --> 03:27:05.952]  Can't say it here.
[03:27:05.952 --> 03:27:07.553]  It's a dirty word.
[03:27:07.553 --> 03:27:10.375]  Starts with F. Ends with U.
[03:27:11.525 --> 03:27:32.538]  Because that's what I'd say if I got an inclusion rider by a talking puppet that told me I should staff my production, my investment, with people that they think are the right people for the job.
[03:27:32.538 --> 03:27:34.579]  Screw a resume.
[03:27:34.579 --> 03:27:39.322]  Screw the fact that there are people that have vast experience.
[03:27:40.345 --> 03:27:43.387]  In doing the job properly and correctly.
[03:27:43.387 --> 03:27:49.272]  We have seen motion pictures over the course of a century in this country.
[03:27:49.272 --> 03:27:56.837]  Over a century that have been deemed brilliant, genius, classic productions.
[03:27:56.837 --> 03:28:09.007]  Because the person putting the production together knew through experience who to put in the various jobs based on nothing but their expertise at that job.
[03:28:09.007 --> 03:28:09.487]  But now,
[03:28:10.430 --> 03:28:37.479]  We have something called an inclusion rider, which Frances McDormand put out and it was received with the accolades by the Hollywood community that she, nothing but another employee on somebody else's set, she says that people have to adhere to what the talking puppet says and hire based on nothing, nothing but
[03:28:38.471 --> 03:28:43.197]  Uh, race, religion, or sex.
[03:28:43.197 --> 03:28:46.060]  It's a catastrophe out there.
[03:28:46.060 --> 03:28:46.941]  It's a catastrophe.
[03:28:46.941 --> 03:28:51.467]  Thank God for places like Infowars.com and Compound Media.

[03:29:26.800 --> 03:29:34.942]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[03:29:34.942 --> 03:29:36.883]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[03:29:54.690 --> 03:30:13.529]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[03:30:13.849 --> 03:30:14.650]  The revolution.

[03:31:19.775 --> 03:31:21.336]  Which Nutraceuticals do you like best?
[03:31:21.576 --> 03:31:24.857]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[03:31:24.857 --> 03:31:25.337]  That's amazing.
[03:31:25.337 --> 03:31:26.317]  That's really incredible.
[03:31:26.317 --> 03:31:29.378]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:31:29.378 --> 03:31:30.738]  Like, I haven't felt sleep.
[03:31:30.738 --> 03:31:32.399]  My morning was fantastic.

[03:31:59.014 --> 03:32:07.120]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:32:07.120 --> 03:32:12.404]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:32:12.404 --> 03:32:14.926]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:32:14.926 --> 03:32:19.149]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:32:19.149 --> 03:32:21.591]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:32:22.271 --> 03:32:29.514]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:32:29.514 --> 03:32:36.698]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:32:37.578 --> 03:32:44.761]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:32:44.761 --> 03:32:46.222]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[03:33:53.743 --> 03:33:54.924]  MycoZX Plus.

[03:34:04.261 --> 03:34:12.932]  Made from wild-crafted and organically certified herbs, MycoZX Plus is formulated for maximum effectiveness.
[03:34:12.932 --> 03:34:21.984]  MycoZX Plus contains incredible ingredients in one powerful supplement that supports healthy microbial balance.
[03:34:22.922 --> 03:34:24.203]  In, uh, in the body.
[03:34:24.203 --> 03:34:29.245]  Made with specifically selected ingredients that focus on intestinal yeast.
[03:34:29.245 --> 03:34:31.645]  My goodness, all the stuff going on inside us.
[03:34:31.645 --> 03:34:33.806]  Supports a healthy digestive tract.
[03:34:33.806 --> 03:34:36.687]  Addresses, uh, internal yeast.
[03:34:36.687 --> 03:34:40.389]  And, uh, our formula's fueled by unique ingredients that power up its potential.
[03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:45.371]  Including grapefruit seed extract, a super potent anti-toxin.
[03:34:45.371 --> 03:34:47.051]  Uh, anti-oxidant.
[03:34:47.051 --> 03:34:47.752]  That's what it is.
[03:34:47.752 --> 03:34:49.352]  It looked like anti-toxin.
[03:34:49.352 --> 03:34:50.613]  It could be.
[03:34:50.613 --> 03:34:50.693]  Oh.
[03:34:52.067 --> 03:34:54.047]  Paul D'Arcobarque.
[03:34:54.047 --> 03:34:55.488]  Paul D'Arcobarque.
[03:34:55.488 --> 03:34:57.688]  I knew him back in Cincinnati.
[03:34:57.688 --> 03:35:10.410]  Paul D'Arcobarque, known to possess micro-balancing properties, grapeseed extract, a marked activity on yeast and high antioxidant potential, garlic bulb.
[03:35:10.410 --> 03:35:13.151]  Don't put those in your lamps.
[03:35:13.151 --> 03:35:18.372]  Well-known preservative agent in food and organic moringa leaf.
[03:35:19.221 --> 03:35:24.422]  Yes, traditionally used as an internal microbe cleanse, and even more.
[03:35:24.422 --> 03:35:28.163]  Don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late.
[03:35:28.163 --> 03:35:32.464]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Myco, uh, what is that?
[03:35:32.464 --> 03:35:33.745]  Myco, Myco.
[03:35:33.745 --> 03:35:35.105]  Yeah.
[03:35:35.105 --> 03:35:39.666]  Myco ZX Plus, now from InfoWars store.
[03:35:39.666 --> 03:35:40.786]  Wow.
[03:35:40.786 --> 03:35:42.267]  A lot of words.
[03:35:42.267 --> 03:35:45.307]  That's a lot of words.
[03:35:45.307 --> 03:35:47.488]  But it sounds like it helps out your, uh, what?
[03:35:47.488 --> 03:35:48.108]  Your intestine.
[03:35:48.689 --> 03:35:49.450]  Good.
[03:35:49.450 --> 03:35:49.771]  Good.
[03:35:49.771 --> 03:35:50.572]  I need help.
[03:35:50.572 --> 03:35:52.654]  I watch the news.
[03:35:52.654 --> 03:35:54.136]  They're tied nuts!
[03:35:54.136 --> 03:35:55.859]  They're tied in knots, my people.
[03:35:55.859 --> 03:35:57.100]  You think I'm done with Hollywood?
[03:35:57.100 --> 03:35:58.382]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:35:58.382 --> 03:35:58.822]  Not at all.
[03:36:01.355 --> 03:36:12.002]  Finally, we have heard every time a celebrity is talking about Trump and an election comes up or Trump does something, you hear these celebrities go, I'm out of here!
[03:36:12.002 --> 03:36:13.142]  I'm moving!
[03:36:13.142 --> 03:36:13.943]  What's the list?
[03:36:13.943 --> 03:36:27.671]  Whoopi Goldberg, Barbra Streisand, Rosie O'Donnell, that rotund woman from Girls.
[03:36:27.671 --> 03:36:28.191]  All of them.
[03:36:28.191 --> 03:36:30.072]  They all say they're bugging out.
[03:36:30.072 --> 03:36:30.773]  They're leaving.
[03:36:31.366 --> 03:36:32.567]  Uh, the U.S.
[03:36:32.567 --> 03:36:34.147]  And then they never leave.
[03:36:34.147 --> 03:36:39.509]  We're still just saddled with them, uh, for years and years and years.
[03:36:39.509 --> 03:36:41.390]  Well, thank goodness!
[03:36:41.390 --> 03:36:42.911]  Matt Damon!
[03:36:42.911 --> 03:36:44.992]  Matt Damon is stepping up!
[03:36:44.992 --> 03:36:45.792]  Good for you!
[03:36:45.792 --> 03:36:48.873]  I salute Matt Damon!
[03:36:48.873 --> 03:36:51.114]  Now, get the hell out!
[03:36:51.114 --> 03:36:54.375]  He's moving to Australia!
[03:36:54.375 --> 03:36:55.736]  Matt Damon!
[03:36:55.736 --> 03:36:57.917]  Look, it's Matt Damon!
[03:36:57.917 --> 03:37:00.678]  He's, uh, going, uh, down under, as they say.
[03:37:01.663 --> 03:37:06.447]  Moving his family to Australia because of Donald Trump, yes.
[03:37:06.447 --> 03:37:08.948]  Matt Damon, moving to Australia.
[03:37:08.948 --> 03:37:17.734]  Damon 47 reportedly has purchased property in Byron Bay, New South Wales, according to Sydney's Sunday Telegraph.
[03:37:17.734 --> 03:37:22.358]  The home next door to a place owned by Chris Hemsworth.
[03:37:22.358 --> 03:37:26.060]  So I guess this is like the, what is this, the Beverly Hills of Australia?
[03:37:26.060 --> 03:37:27.061]  Huh?
[03:37:27.061 --> 03:37:29.603]  Australian Beverly Hillbillies.
[03:37:31.374 --> 03:37:37.096]  Listen, his story about a man named Jed, Paul Matney... I don't know.
[03:37:37.096 --> 03:37:40.718]  I'll pitch that at next Comedy Central meeting.
[03:37:40.718 --> 03:37:51.762]  Damon is telling his friends and colleagues in Hollywood that he's moving his family to Australia because the activist actor disagrees with Trump's policies.
[03:37:51.762 --> 03:37:53.583]  One of Trump's biggest
[03:37:55.123 --> 03:38:02.928]  One of Trump's biggest campaigning points was immigration and the wall, right?
[03:38:02.928 --> 03:38:08.291]  The wall and immigration.
[03:38:08.291 --> 03:38:12.914]  Australia pretty much has no immigration.
[03:38:12.914 --> 03:38:17.957]  You literally have to be Matt Damon to move to Australia.
[03:38:17.957 --> 03:38:20.298]  Australia goes, who wants to get in?
[03:38:20.298 --> 03:38:22.620]  Ah, who's this guy?
[03:38:22.620 --> 03:38:22.820]  Nah.
[03:38:23.604 --> 03:38:24.764]  I say nyeh.
[03:38:24.764 --> 03:38:26.345]  Aye, nyeh.
[03:38:26.345 --> 03:38:28.405]  We're not letting him in.
[03:38:28.405 --> 03:38:31.046]  And then Matt Damon's like, hey, I'm Matt Damon.
[03:38:31.046 --> 03:38:33.146]  I'm a multi-gazillionaire.
[03:38:33.146 --> 03:38:34.646]  I'm an actor.
[03:38:34.646 --> 03:38:41.708]  I will help your country with image and tourism, maybe.
[03:38:41.708 --> 03:38:43.648]  Maybe I'll film a movie here.
[03:38:43.648 --> 03:38:44.969]  That'd be nice.
[03:38:44.969 --> 03:38:46.389]  Ah, man, Diamond.
[03:38:46.389 --> 03:38:48.589]  Sure, let him in.
[03:38:48.589 --> 03:38:50.490]  I've been the guy.
[03:38:50.490 --> 03:38:51.190]  Let him in.
[03:38:52.938 --> 03:38:55.399]  And Matt Damon moves to Australia.
[03:38:55.399 --> 03:39:05.843]  But if he doesn't like Trump, boy, why is he moving to a country that does not allow people to just waltz in.
[03:39:05.843 --> 03:39:08.203]  Waltzing Matilda.
[03:39:08.203 --> 03:39:14.586]  Doesn't allow them to waltz in and set up camp as Australians.
[03:39:14.586 --> 03:39:15.406]  They don't allow it.
[03:39:17.596 --> 03:39:26.083]  First of all, they exile you to an island, some smaller island, and then they try to get other countries to take you.
[03:39:26.083 --> 03:39:31.487]  Obama agreed to take a bunch of Australian illegal immigrants.
[03:39:31.487 --> 03:39:35.610]  And then when Trump got into office, he goes, yeah, no, we don't want them.
[03:39:35.610 --> 03:39:40.013]  And they're like, but Obama agreed to it.
[03:39:40.013 --> 03:39:41.214]  Obama agreed.
[03:39:43.286 --> 03:39:47.349]  Two days ago, I saw Rigg That'll Hole Those Illegals.
[03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:48.810]  You want to get out of here?
[03:39:48.810 --> 03:39:50.030]  Talk to me.
[03:39:50.030 --> 03:39:51.431]  Road Warrior, anyone?
[03:39:51.431 --> 03:39:51.832]  Great.
[03:39:51.832 --> 03:39:53.813]  Great movie.
[03:39:53.813 --> 03:39:58.076]  So, like, they throw people out.
[03:39:58.076 --> 03:40:02.558]  And as far as a wall goes, let me fill you in on something.
[03:40:02.558 --> 03:40:06.301]  As far as a wall goes, it's called the Pacific Ocean!
[03:40:07.972 --> 03:40:16.977]  The only reason Australia doesn't have a wall is because it's called the Great Barrier Reef.
[03:40:16.977 --> 03:40:19.558]  That's Australia's wall.
[03:40:19.558 --> 03:40:28.642]  So they have no immigration and a giant natural boat full of sharks.
[03:40:28.642 --> 03:40:33.925]  Full of glass-like coral and sharks.
[03:40:34.876 --> 03:40:46.245]  And vast expanses of ocean that keep people off of their beloved island, nation, continent.
[03:40:46.245 --> 03:40:53.491]  So that's where Matt Damon wants to go because he doesn't agree with Trump's policies of, look, maybe we'll keep some
[03:40:54.318 --> 03:40:57.400]  We want to build a wall here, but not on the North border.
[03:40:57.400 --> 03:40:58.381]  Don't worry.
[03:40:58.381 --> 03:41:00.142]  You don't like any of those policies.
[03:41:00.142 --> 03:41:07.268]  But I'll move to a place where they literally exile illegals to an island, and then just try to throw them somewhere else.
[03:41:07.268 --> 03:41:14.093]  And their wall is a natural barrier no one could possibly penetrate.
[03:41:14.093 --> 03:41:17.015]  So, Matt, God bless.
[03:41:18.246 --> 03:41:19.506]  Good job!
[03:41:19.506 --> 03:41:20.667]  Get the hell out!
[03:41:20.667 --> 03:41:22.047]  No way out!
[03:41:22.047 --> 03:41:23.367]  No way!
[03:41:23.367 --> 03:41:29.249]  Look at this, the Australian government has introduced the toughest border protection measures ever!
[03:41:29.249 --> 03:41:30.229]  Ever!
[03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:34.510]  And again, that natural barrier is just unbelievable.
[03:41:34.510 --> 03:41:41.492]  We hear about it a lot when they say, when people say, well Australia, as far as guns go, they got rid of all the guns.
[03:41:41.492 --> 03:41:47.033]  They had a buyback program, they bought all the guns back, and they haven't had a mass shooting in blah blah blah blah blah.
[03:41:47.876 --> 03:41:53.618]  Again, they don't have borders that are easily crossed by smugglers.
[03:41:53.618 --> 03:42:01.860]  It's not 1650 where someone could come up with a sailing ship full of spice.
[03:42:01.860 --> 03:42:11.763]  We have two gigantic borders, one of which to the north is full of a bunch of politically correct sissies, I say.
[03:42:11.763 --> 03:42:16.104]  Pardon me, I've met some nice Canadians, but for the most part, Jesus, relax.
[03:42:16.104 --> 03:42:17.104]  We know what we're doing down here.
[03:42:17.879 --> 03:42:24.061]  And Mexico where drugs and guns and Mexicans and everything else flies across the border.
[03:42:24.061 --> 03:42:26.622]  So I don't think it would work for us quite as well.
[03:42:26.622 --> 03:42:31.304]  I think the proverbial bad guys would still be getting their hands on guns.
[03:42:31.304 --> 03:42:31.924]  Australia.
[03:42:31.924 --> 03:42:36.525]  Matt Damon in Australia with the most amazing border wall ever.
[03:42:36.525 --> 03:42:38.566]  The Pacific Ocean.
[03:42:40.072 --> 03:42:43.237]  Yeah, his family probably will be very safe there.
[03:42:43.237 --> 03:42:48.064]  Because the Australian government, as far as immigration, knows exactly what they're doing.
[03:42:48.064 --> 03:42:49.105]  Be back in moments!
[03:42:49.105 --> 03:42:50.127]  Don't you leave!
[03:42:50.127 --> 03:42:51.369]  Anthony Comey at Infowars.com
[03:42:53.706 --> 03:42:57.129]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[03:42:57.129 --> 03:43:01.093]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[03:43:01.093 --> 03:43:04.436]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:43:04.436 --> 03:43:06.978]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:43:06.978 --> 03:43:11.702]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[03:43:11.702 --> 03:43:14.044]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:43:14.044 --> 03:43:20.470]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:21.050 --> 03:43:29.259]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:43:29.259 --> 03:43:34.324]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:43:34.324 --> 03:43:41.291]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:43:41.952 --> 03:43:46.856]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.

[03:45:16.289 --> 03:45:17.430]  I don't feel good.
[03:45:17.430 --> 03:45:21.191]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:45:21.191 --> 03:45:23.872]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:45:23.872 --> 03:45:29.675]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:45:29.675 --> 03:45:32.636]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:45:32.636 --> 03:45:36.178]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:45:36.178 --> 03:45:38.399]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:45:38.399 --> 03:45:38.759]  I love it.
[03:45:38.919 --> 03:45:41.720]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:45:41.720 --> 03:45:42.741]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:42.741 --> 03:45:48.404]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:45:48.404 --> 03:45:50.565]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:45:50.565 --> 03:45:52.586]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.

[03:47:11.323 --> 03:47:15.605]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:47:15.605 --> 03:47:20.008]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:20.008 --> 03:47:26.171]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:47:26.171 --> 03:47:28.252]  Welcome, welcome back.
[03:47:28.252 --> 03:47:36.096]  Thank you, of course, to Alex Jones, InfoWars.com for allowing me, Anthony Cumia, on their waves again.
[03:47:36.096 --> 03:47:37.357]  Love it, love doing the show.
[03:47:38.521 --> 03:47:42.864]  We touched on this a little earlier in the show here.
[03:47:42.864 --> 03:47:45.585]  The kids, they had their walkout.
[03:47:45.585 --> 03:47:47.987]  They had their big school walkout.
[03:47:47.987 --> 03:47:51.109]  And some were arguing they should do a...
[03:47:52.432 --> 03:47:58.494]  The left is hilarious when they demonstrate, when they have their protests and stuff.
[03:47:58.494 --> 03:48:02.236]  It's so ragged and all over the place.
[03:48:02.236 --> 03:48:05.297]  They never seem to be able to focus on any one thing.
[03:48:05.297 --> 03:48:09.879]  It's like, oh, we're going to protest school shootings.
[03:48:09.879 --> 03:48:16.081]  And then there's, you know, transgender for equal toilets.
[03:48:16.081 --> 03:48:19.602]  And you look at the signs, you're like, what the hell?
[03:48:19.602 --> 03:48:21.723]  Just a big conglomeration of
[03:48:22.572 --> 03:48:22.892]  I think?
[03:48:53.065 --> 03:48:58.310]  And, you know, they won't feel so alienated from the cool kids.
[03:48:58.310 --> 03:49:00.151]  From the cool kids.
[03:49:00.151 --> 03:49:03.214]  So they decided to do this walk-up thing.
[03:49:03.214 --> 03:49:11.261]  So I was looking at some of the coverage on that, and I saw a picture that was quite telling.
[03:49:11.261 --> 03:49:15.845]  One school decided they gave every kid 17 post-it notes.
[03:49:17.972 --> 03:49:25.218]  To represent the 17 people killed in the school in Florida.
[03:49:25.218 --> 03:49:33.265]  And what they would do is write something nice about somebody on it, and then stick the post-it note on their locker.
[03:49:33.265 --> 03:49:35.207]  Sounds nice and pleasant.
[03:49:35.207 --> 03:49:36.188]  You know, a nice thing.
[03:49:36.188 --> 03:49:40.432]  You go to your locker and you're like, oh look, somebody likes me.
[03:49:40.432 --> 03:49:41.753]  And I saw a picture of this.
[03:49:42.469 --> 03:49:47.472]  And it showed a bunch of the lockers, a line of lockers and the post-it notes on it.
[03:49:47.472 --> 03:49:55.376]  And the first thing I thought was to count the amount of post-it notes on each of the lockers.
[03:49:55.376 --> 03:49:58.657]  Some had upwards of 20.
[03:49:58.657 --> 03:50:00.898]  Others had two.
[03:50:00.898 --> 03:50:09.763]  And all I could think was the person with two was gonna feel resentment and feel alienated.
[03:50:10.459 --> 03:50:16.383]  And maybe want to shoot the person with 20!
[03:50:16.383 --> 03:50:31.532]  And by the way, years ago when this came up, when it was called Valentine's Day, because that's pretty much what this is, you'd sit in the class, I remember this again, kids, kids, let me tiptoe down memory lane with you again.
[03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:35.490]  When I was in school, Valentine's Day would roll around.
[03:50:35.490 --> 03:50:50.435]  We'd all sit in our respective desks and girls and guys would hand Valentine cards to someone they liked or thought was pretty or whatever.
[03:50:50.435 --> 03:50:55.196]  And some kids had a stack, stack of Valentines.
[03:50:55.663 --> 03:51:00.045]  The pretty girl, the popular boys, it all have stacks.
[03:51:00.045 --> 03:51:04.888]  And then the other people, some of the other people would have a normal amount that you would think.
[03:51:04.888 --> 03:51:07.249]  I brought five and I got five.
[03:51:07.249 --> 03:51:10.071]  Wow, this is kind of nice.
[03:51:10.071 --> 03:51:14.494]  And then there was the kid that got none.
[03:51:14.494 --> 03:51:16.455]  None valentines.
[03:51:16.455 --> 03:51:18.616]  He was called the weirdo.
[03:51:20.285 --> 03:51:30.089]  The weirdo got none, and he would probably end up being one of the guys that would have shot up a school.
[03:51:30.089 --> 03:51:32.590]  But, more likely than that,
[03:51:33.516 --> 03:51:41.300]  All that happened was people learned that there is no such thing, really, as total equality.
[03:51:41.300 --> 03:51:50.245]  Especially when it comes to somebody's subjective opinion of who they like, who they don't, who they want to be with and around, who they find attractive.
[03:51:50.245 --> 03:51:56.329]  All of these things come into play when you're a child handing out a Valentine's Day card.
[03:51:56.329 --> 03:51:58.370]  And this is the way it was for years and years and years.
[03:51:58.968 --> 03:52:09.257]  You learn something called rejection, which, oh my goodness, if you don't learn about rejection very early in life, you are in for a very big disappointment when you get a little older.
[03:52:09.257 --> 03:52:13.520]  Because most of life consists of disappointment.
[03:52:13.520 --> 03:52:16.623]  So, you learn about disappointment.
[03:52:16.623 --> 03:52:23.589]  And then somebody got the bright idea a few decades ago that Valentine's Day is a terrible, terrible thing.
[03:52:24.346 --> 03:52:34.412]  And that we should do away with the ability for kids to come and give out valentines to the people they want to give valentines to.
[03:52:34.412 --> 03:52:37.694]  So everyone got one or no one got one.
[03:52:37.694 --> 03:52:43.237]  And this has been the battle cry for decades now.
[03:52:43.237 --> 03:52:50.281]  And it just makes kids vulnerable to losing their minds when they don't get what they want.
[03:52:52.288 --> 03:53:02.396]  And what we see happening with this walk-up, when they post things on the lockers, is the same thing.
[03:53:02.396 --> 03:53:07.140]  But they've been trained to not be able to deal with stuff like this.
[03:53:07.140 --> 03:53:10.822]  See, these are the same kids that don't get valentines anymore.
[03:53:10.822 --> 03:53:13.765]  Or they get the same valentine everyone gets.
[03:53:13.765 --> 03:53:15.786]  They're not allowed to have parties.
[03:53:15.786 --> 03:53:21.831]  They're not allowed to hang out with a group that's considered bullying.
[03:53:22.641 --> 03:53:26.923]  Uh, if you just hang out with a group of people that you want to hang out with.
[03:53:26.923 --> 03:53:39.609]  So when you put stickers on the locker, it sounds like a good idea, but these kids have been raised in a way that they're not ready to walk up to their three-sticker locker when the locker next to it has 20 stickers on it.
[03:53:39.609 --> 03:53:40.649]  There you go.
[03:53:40.649 --> 03:53:44.411]  There, look at the poor, poor bastard with three.
[03:53:44.411 --> 03:53:47.072]  And then there's other ones, and you know
[03:53:47.987 --> 03:53:52.588]  I know, look, some things change and change and change over the course of the years.
[03:53:52.588 --> 03:53:53.868]  Others don't.
[03:53:53.868 --> 03:53:59.450]  Kids are cruel little sons of bees.
[03:53:59.450 --> 03:54:04.911]  And the kid with the three is going to feel bad.
[03:54:04.911 --> 03:54:13.133]  And like I said, without the ability to deal with it, with having faced disappointment, he's going to lose his mind.
[03:54:13.133 --> 03:54:14.473]  So while this might have been a
[03:54:15.436 --> 03:54:16.777]  A noble thought.
[03:54:16.777 --> 03:54:24.102]  I think it's going to fail miserably when it comes down to somebody cracking open their two or three sticker locker.
[03:54:24.102 --> 03:54:27.284]  I was, I don't even think I went to my locker.
[03:54:27.284 --> 03:54:30.426]  I would have been a three sticker locker guy.
[03:54:30.426 --> 03:54:33.988]  I was the guy that just, I was just trying to make it through.
[03:54:33.988 --> 03:54:37.911]  I didn't care about friends or popularity or who I was hanging.
[03:54:37.911 --> 03:54:44.055]  I had my friends outside of school, but I was not known in school.
[03:54:46.138 --> 03:54:49.879]  I don't think I ever went to a class picture.
[03:54:49.879 --> 03:54:55.921]  I don't think there's a class picture that exists of me past maybe sixth grade.
[03:54:55.921 --> 03:55:01.423]  Because I just didn't, I didn't feel like I fit in with anybody and I didn't really want to.
[03:55:01.423 --> 03:55:02.863]  But I saw what happened.
[03:55:02.863 --> 03:55:07.185]  There were the popular kids and the kids that weren't popular.
[03:55:07.185 --> 03:55:09.245]  And that's just the way kids think.
[03:55:09.245 --> 03:55:14.067]  And it's part of a, like a human, it's ingrained in your DNA.
[03:55:14.067 --> 03:55:15.067]  It's instinctual.
[03:55:15.982 --> 03:55:18.563]  It's some kind of breeding mechanism.
[03:55:18.563 --> 03:55:24.664]  But there are always going to be kids that don't get 20 stickers on their lockers.
[03:55:24.664 --> 03:55:29.405]  And they're going to feel kind of bad about it, I think.
[03:55:29.405 --> 03:55:36.807]  Another thing that we're insane about these days is the unwanted kiss on American Idol.
[03:55:36.807 --> 03:55:38.128]  This was great.
[03:55:38.128 --> 03:55:39.368]  I guess Katy Perry
[03:55:40.517 --> 03:55:42.838]  Kissed a young gentleman.
[03:55:42.838 --> 03:55:45.459]  He was probably 19 years old, I guess.
[03:55:45.459 --> 03:55:47.360]  A guitar player and singer.
[03:55:47.360 --> 03:55:51.462]  And he talked about how he had never been kissed before.
[03:55:51.462 --> 03:56:01.406]  So, she was going to kiss him on the... Or he was going to kiss her on the cheek, and she turned her head and kissed him smack on the lips.
[03:56:01.406 --> 03:56:07.069]  And, you know, any other time in history, any other time in history, this would have been
[03:56:08.158 --> 03:56:08.899]  Nothing.
[03:56:08.899 --> 03:56:10.560]  You'd have just been like, oh, okay.
[03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:12.060]  Whatever.
[03:56:12.060 --> 03:56:15.422]  Well, it's a big thing now, and Katie seems to be in trouble.
[03:56:15.422 --> 03:56:23.627]  Because this boy was saving his first kiss for a wonderful moment later in life.
[03:56:23.627 --> 03:56:28.330]  Like when he finally actually fell in love with somebody, I guess.
[03:56:28.330 --> 03:56:29.991]  He's 19 and never been kissed.
[03:56:30.973 --> 03:56:36.056]  We have a word for that.
[03:56:36.056 --> 03:56:40.018]  Look, whatever his beliefs are, it's fantastic.
[03:56:40.018 --> 03:56:42.419]  But this never would have been anything.
[03:56:42.419 --> 03:56:46.441]  And now it's harassment.
[03:56:46.441 --> 03:56:54.245]  Katy Perry kisses a 19-year-old and it's harassment.
[03:56:54.245 --> 03:56:57.206]  That's where we're residing these days.
[03:56:57.206 --> 03:57:00.648]  That's the United States of America that we're living in.
[03:57:01.678 --> 03:57:04.119]  In 2018.
[03:57:04.119 --> 03:57:05.959]  Everything's harassment.
[03:57:05.959 --> 03:57:07.939]  Everything's a problem.
[03:57:07.939 --> 03:57:11.640]  Everything needs to be addressed.
[03:57:11.640 --> 03:57:20.702]  No one would have, you know, let's say Greta Garbo would have kissed a man, a man on the lips in front of Garbo's Chinese Theater.
[03:57:20.702 --> 03:57:23.163]  There's a lucky young fan.
[03:57:23.163 --> 03:57:25.844]  That's what it would have been back in the day.
[03:57:25.844 --> 03:57:27.804]  But now everything.
[03:57:28.656 --> 03:57:35.959]  It's harassment and it's changing the dynamic of how we deal with each other sexually and socially.
[03:57:35.959 --> 03:57:37.039]  Thank you so much!
[03:57:37.039 --> 03:57:38.900]  Infowars.com, Alex Jones.
[03:57:38.900 --> 03:57:41.841]  I'm Anthony Cumia at CompoundMedia.com.
[03:57:41.841 --> 03:57:42.502]  That's me.
[03:57:42.502 --> 03:57:43.042]  See you next time!
[03:57:43.956 --> 03:57:46.978]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:57:46.978 --> 03:57:51.161]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:57:51.161 --> 03:57:57.865]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:57:57.865 --> 03:58:01.628]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:58:02.328 --> 03:58:22.405]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:58:22.405 --> 03:58:23.326]  And when that happens,
[03:58:23.646 --> 03:58:26.509]  They'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:58:26.509 --> 03:58:37.740]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:58:37.740 --> 03:58:42.865]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:58:44.565 --> 03:58:45.525]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:58:45.525 --> 03:58:46.086]  Good, brother.
[03:58:46.086 --> 03:58:47.806]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:58:47.806 --> 03:58:49.767]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:58:49.767 --> 03:58:53.809]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[03:58:53.809 --> 03:58:56.410]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:58:56.410 --> 03:58:58.831]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:58:58.831 --> 03:59:06.754]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:59:07.014 --> 03:59:10.259]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[03:59:10.259 --> 03:59:11.781]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:59:11.781 --> 03:59:14.825]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:59:14.825 --> 03:59:16.467]  Saving a ton of money there.
[03:59:16.467 --> 03:59:19.211]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs.
[03:59:19.211 --> 03:59:22.295]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated
