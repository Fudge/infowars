[00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:10.267]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:11.848]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.848 --> 00:00:13.409]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.591]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:28.578]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:30.319]  Max Kaiser is our guest.
[00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:41.241]  He has two different international television programs on RT and Press TV.
[00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:45.162]  He is a TV presenter, radio host, entrepreneur, broadcaster, and journalist.
[00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:51.083]  He is the inventor of the virtual specialist technology, prediction markets, Hollywood Stock Exchange, and much more.
[00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:55.065]  He is the presenter of Oracle, BBC.
[00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:59.726]  He's just Al Jazeera, Huffington Post, you name it.
[00:01:00.868 --> 00:01:04.312]  And we appreciate him joining his former Wall Street broker.
[00:01:04.312 --> 00:01:12.580]  You know, he's been saying for years that Goldman Sachs is engineering financial collapse to consolidate and destroy their competition.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.402]  Now that is mainstream news.
[00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:15.703]  Here's the London Guardian.
[00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:16.684]  Now we know the truth.
[00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:19.507]  The financial meltdown wasn't a mistake.
[00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:20.508]  It was a con.
[00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:29.936]  And we have record bonuses now to be paid to Goldman Sachs, just in England, 3.5 billion pounds.
[00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:41.620]  And of course you notice the inner group, JPMorgan Chase and other groups that own the private Federal Reserve holding company, they're all making record profits while hoarding all the bailout money.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.622]  And why has the SEC indicted Goldman Sachs, some of their members,
[00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:47.581]  Civilly.
[00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:53.743]  Well, they'll probably give him a $5 million fine and slap him on the wrist and give somebody probation for the trillions that have been stolen.
[00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:55.984]  But joining us is Max Keiser to discuss this.
[00:01:55.984 --> 00:02:00.705]  We'll also get into the FBI saying the number one threat is us, the American people.
[00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:08.128]  Bill Clinton says, you know, if the Tea Parties don't shut up, people don't criticize Wall Street, that a terror attack is going to happen and it's our fault.
[00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:12.389]  I mean, they're out in the open, folks, getting ready to stage terror attacks here.
[00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.269]  And we'll take your calls on that subject.
[00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.690]  Max Keiser, good to have you here with us.
[00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:19.114]  Yeah, Alex Jones, it's always a pleasure.
[00:02:19.114 --> 00:02:21.955]  Well, I tell you, things are getting crazy.
[00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:26.798]  Let's get into Goldman Sachs and financial terrorism.
[00:02:26.798 --> 00:02:27.339]  Right.
[00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:32.602]  Well, as you point out, I've been talking about this for a number of years.
[00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:44.610]  Basically, they have been involved, as have other Wall Street banks, in setting up banks to fail because they can profit on the failure.
[00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:56.604]  So, just like we've talked about before about Building 7, during the 9-11 incident, there were many options traders that made a lot of money because the Building 7 collapsed.
[00:02:56.604 --> 00:02:58.824]  Now, here's Goldman Sachs, same thing.
[00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:09.907]  They create a fund, they create bonds that they build to collapse, that they rig with financial dynamite so that it collapses, and they make money on the collapse.
[00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:11.807]  It's financial terrorism.
[00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:13.588]  It's a controlled demolition.
[00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:14.968]  That's how they make a lot of their money.
[00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:19.512]  That's how they make most of their money.
[00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:28.261]  Well, there's no doubt that the stimulus has run out, and now they're saying, okay, maybe it is a depression, we need more money.
[00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:44.629]  Obama's new regulation package allows the top banks and brokerage firms to, through their regulators that they control, to basically feed other smaller regional healthy banks into their maw, and a tax on smaller institutions that's paid through bailout money to them.
[00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.152]  I mean, this is, we've got Gordon Brown calling for a world government of and for and by the banks.
[00:03:50.152 --> 00:03:51.433]  I mean, it's just getting crazy.
[00:03:52.791 --> 00:04:03.622]  Well, you know, it's interesting because Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, of course, famously said that he was doing God's work when he and his cohorts are
[00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:18.693]  Creating all of these problems for everybody and creating blackmail situations and extortion to get their buddy Hank Paulson to extort 700 billion if you recall back there at the end of 2008 in front of Congress.
[00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:23.719]  But apparently he's angered the gods because now in Iceland the volcano is blowing up.
[00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:32.362]  And it's what's remarkable, Alex, is that this is similar to almost exactly what happened during the French Revolution.
[00:04:32.362 --> 00:04:36.385]  Actually, the French Revolution started when a volcano in Iceland blew up.
[00:04:36.385 --> 00:04:39.747]  It caused global problems with agriculture.
[00:04:39.747 --> 00:04:42.469]  And this was what set... You know what?
[00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.969]  You know what?
[00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.451]  I mean, it's like a comet being a portent of doom.
[00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:53.434]  It's like God was showing people the Earth freezing solid, basically, right as they tried to pass their global warming takeover.
[00:04:53.434 --> 00:04:54.254]  Now you're right.
[00:04:54.254 --> 00:04:55.935]  I've forgotten that historically.
[00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:59.356]  Mega volcanoes shrouding Europe in dust.
[00:04:59.356 --> 00:04:59.756]  Stay there.
[00:05:06.727 --> 00:05:11.552]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:13.154]  You want answers?
[00:05:13.154 --> 00:05:14.696]  Well, so does he.
[00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:18.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.945]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:51.094]  Well, the first two hours were dedicated to the fact that it's 100% the military-industrial complex that controls both parties is going to stage a terror attack to blame it on people that want to end the Fed, people that want to audit the Fed, that want to arrest the people that run Goldman Sachs, that controlled all the regulatory positions, and aren't just ripping our country off, they're ripping off countries from Chile to New Zealand to Greece to Iceland.
[00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.511]  And they've been building this propaganda up.
[00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:56.453]  They claim the Tea Party's a right-wing.
[00:05:56.453 --> 00:05:59.437]  It becomes a self-fulfilling Republican prophecy.
[00:05:59.437 --> 00:06:01.959]  Then they begin... And what are they doing?
[00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.861]  They're not going to let it happen.
[00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:10.008]  They're going to make sure that we become a services sector society.
[00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.911]  Think of the word.
[00:06:11.911 --> 00:06:13.292]  Servitude.
[00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:14.593]  Service.
[00:06:14.593 --> 00:06:15.334]  Surf.
[00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:17.455]  Hey, look at the great jobs!
[00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:22.319]  You wanna be a cashier at a 7-Eleven?
[00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.121]  Hey, I got one for you!
[00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:31.326]  How about working at Walmart at 2 in the morning and crawling between shelves to stock them?
[00:06:31.326 --> 00:06:34.509]  That's what they're doing to the American public.
[00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:38.552]  And then, they're gonna take us to war when all else fails.
[00:06:38.552 --> 00:06:40.033]  Alright, we're gonna get back into that.
[00:06:40.573 --> 00:06:45.096]  When we start the next segment, that's the key here, and I've got a whole host of issues I want to go through.
[00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:48.478]  The top trends forecaster in the world wrote the book on it.
[00:06:48.478 --> 00:06:51.380]  Stunning accuracy in his trends.
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.341]  Again, we're so honored to have him.
[00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.782]  TrendsResearch.com.
[00:06:53.782 --> 00:06:54.742]  Gerald Salente is his name.
[00:06:54.742 --> 00:06:55.763]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:55.763 --> 00:06:58.705]  If you just joined us, but I want to back you up on what you just said.
[00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:01.026]  Animal ID, premises ID.
[00:07:01.026 --> 00:07:03.568]  On both sides of my family, I come from farmers and ranchers.
[00:07:04.108 --> 00:07:05.490]  They come in with regulations.
[00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.734]  They say you've got to have premises ID, animal ID.
[00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:14.360]  You've got to have a $14 tag per chicken in your small chicken coop.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.367]  They have federal inspectors that the news admits are focused on small farms and small outfits.
[00:07:20.367 --> 00:07:21.869]  $14 tag per turkey.
[00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:24.112]  You can only sell the chicken for three, four bucks.
[00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:39.280]  to one of the big groups, one of the big combines that processes them, but then Tyson Chicken is exempt and gets one ID per 10,000 chickens because they wrote the regulations to shut down their competition.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.763]  They allow all this dirty beef to be shipped in from all over the world.
[00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.644]  They put more regulations on U.S.
[00:07:44.644 --> 00:07:45.665]  beef producers.
[00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:51.650]  And our own news media put out today that our beef is dirty when our beef is some of the cleanest and best in the world.
[00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.053]  Everything by these globalists is economic warfare.
[00:07:55.053 --> 00:07:58.716]  Expanding on that, they're trying to shut down vitamins and mineral companies.
[00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:01.018]  Globally through the Codex Alimentarius.
[00:08:01.018 --> 00:08:03.680]  Any industry that's grassroots, they're coming after it.
[00:08:04.378 --> 00:08:06.819]  Exactly, it squeezed the little guy!
[00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:11.181]  They're doing it with taxes, they're doing it with regulations.
[00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:12.062]  Look what happens!
[00:08:12.062 --> 00:08:14.063]  I mean, you see it all the time!
[00:08:14.063 --> 00:08:22.427]  They crush the small people for the smallest infraction, and they let the big guys get away with murder!
[00:08:22.427 --> 00:08:23.067]  Literally!
[00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:26.390]  And look right here in New York State, it's great.
[00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.353]  We had Eliot Spitzer, the esteemed governor.
[00:08:29.353 --> 00:08:32.877]  You know, he was caught with a prostitute, remember?
[00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:34.478]  A couple of months back.
[00:08:34.478 --> 00:08:38.542]  And this is the guy that was disgraced out of office.
[00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:44.749]  And this is the guy that wrote the rule that they would prosecute Johns that were caught with laws.
[00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:50.413]  He gets caught, they don't prosecute him, and now he has his own talk show!
[00:08:50.413 --> 00:08:52.755]  You couldn't do better than this one!
[00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:56.237]  The Big Get a Free Ride.
[00:08:56.237 --> 00:09:03.162]  This isn't America, this is France just before the Reign of Terror.
[00:09:03.642 --> 00:09:05.284]  Let them eat cake.
[00:09:05.284 --> 00:09:09.128]  They're pushing it right in everybody's face.
[00:09:09.128 --> 00:09:14.794]  We cannot see it more blatantly done than the way they're doing it every day.
[00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:17.772]  And there's a method to the madness.
[00:09:17.772 --> 00:09:19.813]  They want to push us into armed rebellion.
[00:09:19.813 --> 00:09:25.778]  They're involved in these militias and everywhere else, trying to provocateur us into violence.
[00:09:25.778 --> 00:09:30.261]  We'll talk about where Gerald Solente sees the domestic situation going.
[00:09:30.261 --> 00:09:31.502]  What is the breaking point?
[00:09:31.502 --> 00:09:33.783]  Where will there be physical revolution?
[00:09:33.783 --> 00:09:37.085]  Why is the system trying to kick that off early?
[00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:38.747]  It's not so they can nip it in the bud.
[00:09:38.747 --> 00:09:42.870]  But first, the march to the Third World War.
[00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.731]  It's not just Gerald Solente saying that.
[00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:48.616]  Other world leaders are saying this could be the start of World War 3.
[00:09:48.616 --> 00:09:51.921]  By design, stay with us.
[00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:53.323]  We're on the march.
[00:09:53.323 --> 00:09:55.867]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:09:55.867 --> 00:09:58.530]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:10:01.357 --> 00:10:03.678]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:10:03.678 --> 00:10:06.059]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:09.260]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:14.361]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:10:14.361 --> 00:10:18.563]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:10:18.883 --> 00:10:21.346]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:10:21.346 --> 00:10:24.109]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:10:24.109 --> 00:10:27.032]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:10:27.032 --> 00:10:34.641]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:40.365]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:10:40.365 --> 00:10:43.206]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:46.889]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:47.969]  And I got news for you.
[00:10:47.969 --> 00:10:49.310]  You're everyone else.
[00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.811]  Invisible Empire.

[00:12:09.475 --> 00:12:13.959]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[00:13:04.491 --> 00:13:05.411]  We are back live.
[00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:09.733]  We're going to go through issue after issue with Gerald Cilente, interspersed with your phone calls.
[00:13:09.733 --> 00:13:14.355]  Tripp, Justin, Ron, Scott, Joe, and others that are holding the toll-free number to join us, NS800-259-9231.
[00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.759]  I got two sponsors I want to tell you about.
[00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:28.305]  You'll notice all of our sponsors are about empowering the individual, empowering the family, and supporting Made in America.
[00:13:28.305 --> 00:13:30.968]  Like Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:13:30.968 --> 00:13:33.189]  I'm a Levi's man, but not anymore.
[00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:36.873]  They're made in Mexico.
[00:13:36.873 --> 00:13:39.415]  They keep ripping, the crotches keep ripping out of them.
[00:13:40.077 --> 00:13:42.959]  I mean, I pick up a box, put it in the back of my car, they rip.
[00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:43.739]  They're junk.
[00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:45.601]  I won't be buying any more Levi's.
[00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:47.002]  I love Diamond Gusset.
[00:13:47.002 --> 00:13:48.342]  Made in America.
[00:13:48.342 --> 00:13:50.024]  The fabric, they're put together.
[00:13:50.024 --> 00:13:52.225]  100% made in America.
[00:13:52.225 --> 00:13:54.126]  Diamond Gusset jeans.
[00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:56.548]  Gussetclothing.com.
[00:13:56.548 --> 00:13:57.448]  That's Gusset.
[00:13:57.448 --> 00:14:01.231]  G-U-S-S-E-T clothing dot com.
[00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:05.574]  You've heard their jingle that is very, very
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.161]  Addictive.
[00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:10.985]  Everyone's singing it around the office.
[00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:12.367]  Seriously, we are.
[00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:14.650]  Gussetclothing.com.
[00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.212]  Made in America.
[00:14:16.212 --> 00:14:22.801]  They've got motorcycle jeans, regular jeans, everything at gussetclothing.com.
[00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:27.325]  And another sponsor, survivalseedbank.com.
[00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:35.135]  I mean, even if you've got some tomatoes and squash and stuff like that growing in your backyard, and peppers, humans naturally do this.
[00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:38.760]  My kids could spend 10 hours outside just watering and playing with our garden.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.323]  We just put in a garden in the back, and we do it every year.
[00:14:41.323 --> 00:14:42.164]  The springtime's here.
[00:14:43.194 --> 00:14:49.116]  So buy one Survival Seed Bank, non-GMO, non-hybrid, and plant it, and buy another one, and save it.
[00:14:49.116 --> 00:14:53.477]  But you can also, because it's non-hybrid, non-GMO, you can replant the seeds that you get out this year.
[00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:55.258]  This is what humans are meant to do.
[00:14:55.258 --> 00:14:56.538]  And they're a great sponsor.
[00:14:56.538 --> 00:15:00.299]  SurvivalSeedBank.com, or give them a call, 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.580]  And of course, information is important as well.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.780]  Be sure and visit TrendsResearch.com.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.060]  Okay, Gerald,
[00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:19.726]  I want to start going to calls in the next segment and back into trends in the next hour, but I'm going to try to shut up here and just ask quick questions but with key points.
[00:15:19.726 --> 00:15:21.667]  I know governments have staged terror.
[00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:23.668]  I know Operation Northwoods is an official U.S.
[00:15:23.668 --> 00:15:26.029]  government plan to stage 9-11 style attacks.
[00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:34.913]  I don't put it past these bankers, this isn't our government anymore, these corporate mafia, from staging a dirty bomb or even a nuke or busting somebody in a fake attack.
[00:15:34.913 --> 00:15:36.574]  Imagine the clampdown they could have.
[00:15:36.574 --> 00:15:41.616]  The only way I see them being able to launch their war on Iran, which they're now trying to blame suitcase nukes on,
[00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:44.697]  is a massive crisis.
[00:15:44.697 --> 00:15:48.257]  We've already been lied to about fictitious WMDs in Iraq once.
[00:15:48.257 --> 00:15:50.238]  Now they're just coming back with the same story.
[00:15:50.238 --> 00:15:52.218]  But I do see them staging terror.
[00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:54.659]  I've seen them hyping that the Tea Parties are violent.
[00:15:54.659 --> 00:15:58.140]  They've been caught planting people in there, even in the AP now, yesterday.
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.841]  So, everything I see them do is false flag, set-ups, frame-ups.
[00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:09.322]  How do you see them getting us into a war, which the Rand Corporation said two years ago they need to build their New World Order?
[00:16:10.632 --> 00:16:16.353]  Well, we believe Iran is going to be the target.
[00:16:16.353 --> 00:16:24.856]  The other one is there really may be a terror strike, legitimately, coming out of Pakistan.
[00:16:24.856 --> 00:16:26.776]  This should be the major news.
[00:16:26.776 --> 00:16:34.218]  Every day, virtually, they're sending predator drones in and killing scores of innocent people.
[00:16:34.218 --> 00:16:38.619]  I believe the number is well over a thousand now in the last year.
[00:16:39.857 --> 00:16:42.838]  This is as old as the Old Testament.
[00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:44.939]  It's an eye for an eye.
[00:16:44.939 --> 00:16:51.721]  You have the greatest refugee crisis going on in Pakistan since Rwanda.
[00:16:51.721 --> 00:16:55.362]  And they're escalating that war even more.
[00:16:55.362 --> 00:17:00.304]  And of course the CIA is behind sending these drones in.
[00:17:00.304 --> 00:17:01.885]  Since when was the CIA
[00:17:03.095 --> 00:17:06.976]  Supposed to be in the battle like this.
[00:17:06.976 --> 00:17:10.317]  I thought they were only there to collect intelligence.
[00:17:10.317 --> 00:17:17.999]  So we're really looking at something, Alex, where we have well over 200,000 Pakistanis in this country.
[00:17:17.999 --> 00:17:21.640]  They're watching their families get murdered.
[00:17:22.358 --> 00:17:25.220]  You think they're going to be angry?
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.884]  They're going to say when terrorists strike, they hate our freedom and liberty.
[00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:36.848]  How about they hate your foreign policy and they hate you for killing innocent people.
[00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:40.991]  Look what happened in Afghanistan two days ago.
[00:17:40.991 --> 00:17:44.313]  They strafed the passenger bus.
[00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.615]  There's plenty of hatred out there.
[00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:55.988]  False flag or real, we're forecasting in 2010 a 9-11 magnitude terrorist strike.
[00:17:55.988 --> 00:18:01.512]  And we're saying this as well so people can take proactive measures.
[00:18:01.512 --> 00:18:02.673]  What does it mean?
[00:18:02.673 --> 00:18:14.621]  Well, it means the things that you're talking about on your show, the products, the survival products, and it means having gold to us, but it also means what happened after 9-11.
[00:18:14.621 --> 00:18:15.122]  They shut the
[00:18:17.185 --> 00:18:18.707]  The Wall Street down.
[00:18:18.707 --> 00:18:31.242]  I couldn't cash in my CDs because I wanted to get away from here because Indian Point nuclear power plant is just north of 9-11 and I'm of ground zero and I'm just north of that.
[00:18:31.906 --> 00:18:38.251]  So when I went to get my CDs, I couldn't get them out because Wall Street was closed their financial instruments.
[00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:45.376]  This time, when 9-11 magnitude terror strikes, we forecast they're going to close the banks.
[00:18:45.376 --> 00:18:48.019]  You're not going to be able to get your money out.
[00:18:48.019 --> 00:18:51.962]  And there's going to be cyber attacks as well.
[00:18:51.962 --> 00:18:56.185]  And when you do get your money out, the little bit they'll let you take out at a time,
[00:18:57.057 --> 00:18:58.798]  It's gonna be devalued.
[00:18:58.798 --> 00:19:03.581]  Just like they devalued it under FDR when they called a bank holiday.
[00:19:03.581 --> 00:19:06.462]  Just like they devalued it in Argentina.
[00:19:06.462 --> 00:19:08.323]  They'll devalue it again.
[00:19:08.323 --> 00:19:16.327]  That's one of the ways they're gonna try to get out of this financial mountain of debt that's bringing down the nation.
[00:19:16.327 --> 00:19:17.508]  And just to back you up,
[00:19:18.447 --> 00:19:21.910]  We see Citibank and the other big banks saying, well, hold your money for seven days.
[00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.171]  We see Bloomberg.
[00:19:23.171 --> 00:19:26.713]  Federal regulators are ordering public and private pension funds.
[00:19:26.713 --> 00:19:29.916]  Since when can you do that in a free country to invest in failed banks?
[00:19:29.916 --> 00:19:30.476]  That's a quote.
[00:19:30.476 --> 00:19:33.018]  In fact, print me the Bloomberg or Businessweek again.
[00:19:33.018 --> 00:19:36.801]  It actually says, and now Argentina just took their pension funds.
[00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.923]  Greece is talking about taking their pension funds.
[00:19:38.923 --> 00:19:45.007]  They tried to take the Icelandic pension funds, but the people rioted for a year and said no.
[00:19:45.007 --> 00:19:45.348]  And so
[00:19:46.008 --> 00:19:47.169]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:19:47.169 --> 00:19:49.470]  They're openly saying they're going to take the pension funds.
[00:19:49.470 --> 00:20:00.656]  The cybersecurity bill passed the House, now in the Senate, says for any emergency, including financial, the president can, quote, shut down the internet or selectively shut down the web.
[00:20:00.656 --> 00:20:03.358]  We see internet censorship passing in Italy.
[00:20:03.358 --> 00:20:04.618]  We see it passing in France.
[00:20:04.618 --> 00:20:07.120]  We see it passing last week in England.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:14.384]  We see national publications, mainly singling me out, saying I'm calling for violence when I'm not, calling for censoring us.
[00:20:14.904 --> 00:20:39.664]  I mean, so, clearly you can see them lining everything up and getting ready for a war as a political distraction, but the real enemy is us, fleecing us further, and like a bully, sitting on our chest, pounding us in the face, breaking our will, so the criminal made-offs and kin-lay types that run our society, they're trying to go for broke, and then make sure they can protect themselves from the people.
[00:20:40.746 --> 00:20:41.267]  Exactly.
[00:20:41.267 --> 00:20:44.009]  Like I said, these are nothing more than money junkies.
[00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.810]  They can't get enough.
[00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.371]  Just like a heroin addict.
[00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:51.435]  They have no bounds, no boundaries, no loyalties.
[00:20:51.435 --> 00:20:54.497]  They'll do anything to get their money fixed.
[00:20:54.497 --> 00:20:56.639]  And that's what's going on now.
[00:20:56.639 --> 00:21:01.823]  And then the other ones, the politicians, they need their power fixed.
[00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:03.224]  So it's a perfect group.
[00:21:04.043 --> 00:21:08.645]  They're the gang, and they are destroying this nation.
[00:21:08.645 --> 00:21:15.747]  And as we've said before, people railing about, oh, nationalism and socialism, it's fascism.
[00:21:15.747 --> 00:21:18.288]  The merger of state and corporate powers.
[00:21:18.288 --> 00:21:20.008]  Oh, here's a beauty for you today.
[00:21:20.008 --> 00:21:24.970]  You know this private equity firm, Syribus?
[00:21:25.732 --> 00:21:31.913]  They own Chrysler, and they also own 51% of GMAC.
[00:21:31.913 --> 00:21:39.795]  And this private equity group, the chairman and CEO is John Snow.
[00:21:39.795 --> 00:21:46.056]  He was the Treasury Secretary before Hank Paulson under Bush.
[00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:53.418]  One of the board of directors is that brilliant, shining light of intelligence and integrity, Dan Quayle.
[00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:59.104]  Well, today it was announced that Cerebus just bought Dinecorp.
[00:21:59.653 --> 00:22:01.915]  You know those mercenaries?
[00:22:01.915 --> 00:22:05.078]  Those soldiers of the Fortune 500?
[00:22:05.078 --> 00:22:08.101]  Those military contractors?
[00:22:08.101 --> 00:22:09.762]  That's what's going on.
[00:22:09.762 --> 00:22:11.604]  We bail out Chrysler.
[00:22:11.604 --> 00:22:14.086]  We bail out GMAC.
[00:22:14.086 --> 00:22:16.348]  And what do they do with that money?
[00:22:16.348 --> 00:22:19.391]  They buy another piece of the war.
[00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:20.632]  It's a racket.
[00:22:20.632 --> 00:22:22.113]  Just follow the names.
[00:22:22.113 --> 00:22:24.916]  I've said this over and over and I'll say it again.
[00:22:25.532 --> 00:22:34.078]  If the names on Wall Street were named Solenti, Caruso, Mondavi, Puccini, Rossini, they'd call it the Mafia.
[00:22:34.078 --> 00:22:40.642]  But when you call it Dan Quayle and Jon Snow and Hank Paulson, oh no!
[00:22:40.642 --> 00:22:48.307]  They're just public servants and really, really swell financial geniuses.
[00:22:48.307 --> 00:22:53.890]  Well, Gerald Solenti had Catherine Austen Fitch, you know, high-level former federal officer,
[00:22:55.865 --> 00:22:56.285]  Brilliant woman!
[00:23:16.886 --> 00:23:21.031]  It's biggest business in the US is running CPS.
[00:23:21.031 --> 00:23:27.259]  So the counties and cities stealing people's kids without due process and then selling them off literally to adoption agencies.
[00:23:29.446 --> 00:23:32.670]  Once I found out about it, I googled searched it, there were thousands of articles.
[00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:42.080]  DynCorp is now not just running white slavery rings, as the Chicago Tribune reported a few years ago overseas, in Serbia, they're here running it.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.526]  So now these Pentagon groups are literally hunting us and our children, and I didn't even know it!
[00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:48.728]  Think of what else I don't know!
[00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:56.480]  And before we were talking about how they're clamping down on the little people with regulations.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:04.025]  Oh, they just came out with the latest IRS reports and how they're not going after big corporations.
[00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:04.566]  That's right.
[00:24:04.566 --> 00:24:07.388]  They're going after the little people.
[00:24:07.388 --> 00:24:11.291]  Don't the people see what's going on over here?
[00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:15.574]  They're going to crush the rebellion before it starts.
[00:24:15.574 --> 00:24:17.155]  We're making it really clear.
[00:24:17.615 --> 00:24:20.737]  We're calling for an intellectual revolution.
[00:24:20.737 --> 00:24:22.938]  One of the minds, not guns.
[00:24:22.938 --> 00:24:26.139]  Because you're not gonna outgun these guys.
[00:24:26.139 --> 00:24:32.042]  And anybody that thinks they are, or they're out of their minds, they'll crush you like a gnat.
[00:24:32.042 --> 00:24:36.064]  We've won a revolution in this country before with minds.
[00:24:36.064 --> 00:24:37.304]  We could win it again.
[00:24:37.304 --> 00:24:41.086]  And that's what we're saying that can't happen.
[00:24:41.086 --> 00:24:42.126]  You know, it's that 20% solution.
[00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:55.362]  It's the people that will not follow the deranged that want to turn them into murderers to fight other wars that say, no, we're going to stop.
[00:24:55.362 --> 00:25:05.432]  And if we stop these wars and we start concentrating and bringing the resources back to this country, we can rebuild it step by step.
[00:25:06.843 --> 00:25:07.984]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:25:07.984 --> 00:25:08.465]  Here it is.
[00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:12.128]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[00:25:12.128 --> 00:25:13.510]  Business week.
[00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.051]  And this is now all over the news.
[00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:17.233]  It was in the London Telegraph yesterday.
[00:25:17.233 --> 00:25:25.482]  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corps is trying to encourage public retirement funds that control more than $2 trillion to buy all are part of failed lenders.
[00:25:26.002 --> 00:25:31.287]  So the big banks move their money out the back door and buy real assets, then they put the public on the hook.
[00:25:31.287 --> 00:25:37.392]  So all these cops and people being replaced by DynCorp now to snatch kids, they're going to take your pension funds.
[00:25:37.392 --> 00:25:44.038]  And it goes on to say the government is ordering the pension funds to invest in failed banks.
[00:25:44.038 --> 00:25:46.460]  Since when in the land of the free, home of the brave,
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.104]  Does the government regulators order the pension funds where to put their money?
[00:25:52.104 --> 00:25:53.625]  Well, it's all selectively enforced.
[00:25:53.625 --> 00:25:55.026]  I want to back you up here.
[00:25:55.026 --> 00:26:00.630]  If they don't, the laws, millions of laws, there's millions, are written where nobody can follow the law.
[00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.392]  It's all selectively enforced, so they'll go in and shut them down.
[00:26:03.392 --> 00:26:06.614]  That's what Katherine Austen Fitts said and agreed with me here last week.
[00:26:06.614 --> 00:26:10.977]  But then, you talked about the articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times
[00:26:11.849 --> 00:26:30.974]  In the last year that I've seen, where not only have they cut almost all of the white-collar investigators off of big banks, big corporations that pay almost no tax, it's reported, but when they do bust a Swiss bank account and make it big news in Reuters today, it was for $200,000.
[00:26:30.974 --> 00:26:33.455]  So they're busting little bitty chump level.
[00:26:33.455 --> 00:26:40.757]  That sounds a lot to a McDonald's worker, but that's nothing, you know, to the elite who are in the trillions and hundreds of billions individually in some cases.
[00:26:41.437 --> 00:26:55.428]  And then I remember reading articles about now they're not even having them go after upper middle class, it's after blue-collar, people $35,000, and that they send two uniformed officers to Sacramento to a guy's car wash that hadn't paid four cents.
[00:26:55.428 --> 00:26:56.449]  In fact, pull that up.
[00:26:56.449 --> 00:27:01.773]  It was two or four cents, Sacramento B. Car wash visit over two cents.
[00:27:01.773 --> 00:27:03.954]  And they threatened him over two cents.
[00:27:03.954 --> 00:27:07.317]  Again, they've got the few investigators going after people for two cents.
[00:27:08.188 --> 00:27:09.709]  Well, the same thing here in New York.
[00:27:09.709 --> 00:27:15.614]  They're busting people to go into beauty parlors to get all the sales tax they can.
[00:27:15.614 --> 00:27:17.255]  Little cafe owners.
[00:27:17.255 --> 00:27:22.339]  They're cracking down on the little people, and they have the goon squads behind them.
[00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:27.183]  There's a lot of things going on right now that people should be watching around the world.
[00:27:27.183 --> 00:27:29.125]  And one of them, of course, is Greece.
[00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:30.366]  This is just the beginning.
[00:27:30.734 --> 00:27:35.740]  We could actually see the breakup of the European Monetary Union.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.924]  There's going to be countries that aren't going to be able to cut it.
[00:27:38.924 --> 00:27:42.629]  But also, look at the riots going on in Thailand.
[00:27:42.629 --> 00:27:44.030]  Look what's going on in Kyrgyzstan.
[00:27:45.037 --> 00:27:49.521]  Look what's going on in Latvia, Lithuania, the Ukraine.
[00:27:49.521 --> 00:27:53.264]  The seeds of war are already fermenting.
[00:27:53.264 --> 00:27:54.506]  They're blossoming.
[00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.287]  They're coming up from the ground.
[00:27:56.287 --> 00:27:57.829]  Look what happened in Hungary.
[00:27:57.829 --> 00:28:01.232]  Again, people should really take a global view.
[00:28:01.232 --> 00:28:10.420]  They just brought in a very right-wing government, and the neo-Nazi party, they just got almost 20% of the vote.
[00:28:12.168 --> 00:28:16.351]  So we're going to start seeing some real backlash is going on.
[00:28:16.351 --> 00:28:24.536]  And and the other thing that we're we're forecasting is that when the stimulus money runs out, the crash is going to happen.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.081]  And we believe it's going to be a currency crash.
[00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:33.663]  And again, look what's going on in Europe, and they're covering it up.
[00:28:33.663 --> 00:28:36.124]  It's much worse than they're making it seem.
[00:28:36.124 --> 00:28:41.206]  Even with Greece, and you go back to December of 2009, a couple of months ago,
[00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:44.827]  They said, oh, don't worry about it.
[00:28:44.827 --> 00:28:47.630]  The Greece problem is not going to be a big one.
[00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:48.711]  We can take care of it.
[00:28:48.711 --> 00:28:50.993]  Well, they just broke the rules.
[00:28:50.993 --> 00:28:58.539]  They said they would never, under the Maastricht Agreement, bail out a failed country, and now they're doing it.
[00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:03.583]  So the entire systems are failing, and people better plan for the worst.
[00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:07.942]  And a correction, there's CBS News.
[00:29:07.942 --> 00:29:09.903]  We'll throw it back up on screen.
[00:29:09.903 --> 00:29:13.985]  Sacramento Car Wash gets IRS visit over four cents.
[00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:15.146]  I was going from memory.
[00:29:15.146 --> 00:29:17.047]  I'm sorry, it was over a lot more money.
[00:29:17.047 --> 00:29:18.467]  It was four cents.
[00:29:18.467 --> 00:29:23.269]  Imagine sending the IRS to threaten someone over four cents.
[00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:25.290]  What are these IRS agents thinking?
[00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:28.452]  They can't go after Bernie Madoff, but they can go after somebody with four cents.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.021]  Well, again, that's the whole system.
[00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:32.502]  It's the cops crashing down.
[00:29:32.502 --> 00:29:42.311]  Look, if you have two glasses of wine and they stop you, they'll throw you against the car and handcuff you and send you to jail.
[00:29:42.311 --> 00:29:43.592]  I mean, come on!
[00:29:43.592 --> 00:29:46.074]  It's squeezed the little people.
[00:29:46.074 --> 00:29:49.457]  This is classic when an empire is in decline.
[00:29:49.457 --> 00:29:52.459]  And America is that declining empire.
[00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:55.441]  So that's what happens and that's why revolts begin.
[00:29:55.441 --> 00:29:58.364]  As you said, they have the agents provocateur.
[00:29:58.837 --> 00:30:08.722]  That they keep putting in, whether it's a peaceful demonstration, and all of a sudden you see a squad of guys coming out, and they call them anarchists with masks on, and who are they?
[00:30:08.722 --> 00:30:10.724]  They're the police!
[00:30:10.724 --> 00:30:15.966]  And they're making it look as though it's the average person that's causing the damage.
[00:30:15.966 --> 00:30:20.809]  And the same thing as you pointed out, the infiltrators of these tea parties.
[00:30:20.809 --> 00:30:27.613]  So we're really in a very crucial time right now, and we could go either way, but unquestionably,
[00:30:28.297 --> 00:30:33.563]  After this stimulus high runs out, the economy is going to crash.
[00:30:33.563 --> 00:30:39.769]  They're going to try to keep it alive for the 2010 midterm elections, but after that...
[00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:42.289]  It's going to fall apart.
[00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:46.430]  But we're forecasting, actually, it may happen even before then.
[00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:47.150]  You're saying before 2010.
[00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.290]  Stay there.
[00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:53.732]  We're going to come back, get into your forecast on the economy, and then take phone calls.
[00:30:53.732 --> 00:30:56.093]  A whole other hour of Gerald Solinte coming up.
[00:30:56.093 --> 00:30:57.753]  He's been very gracious with us.
[00:30:57.753 --> 00:30:58.973]  We're very, very thankful.
[00:30:58.973 --> 00:30:59.373]  Stay with us.
[00:31:01.863 --> 00:31:03.163]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:03.163 --> 00:31:08.745]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:08.745 --> 00:31:13.766]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:13.766 --> 00:31:19.348]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:31:19.348 --> 00:31:24.569]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:24.569 --> 00:31:26.430]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:31:26.877 --> 00:31:31.681]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:32.802]  And here's the best part.
[00:31:32.802 --> 00:31:35.884]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:31:35.884 --> 00:31:39.487]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:31:39.487 --> 00:31:42.690]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:44.911]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[00:31:45.852 --> 00:31:46.253]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:31:46.253 --> 00:31:47.173]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:58.540]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.929]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[00:34:07.472 --> 00:34:20.317]  The AP reported yesterday, several weeks after our initial investigation, that groups all over the country are infiltrating the Tea Parties to pose as racist and do other things.
[00:34:20.317 --> 00:34:25.939]  Well, here is, uh, Braverton teacher faces investigation over Tea Party infiltration.
[00:34:25.939 --> 00:34:31.441]  He also has a company that supplies much of the city with their internet.
[00:34:31.441 --> 00:34:33.042]  And I've said this is racketeering.
[00:34:33.042 --> 00:34:35.443]  You try to go to peaceful political protest
[00:34:36.187 --> 00:34:43.952]  And make them look like kooks, or make them look like racists, as other groups are saying they're going to do, or try to cause violence, as other groups are saying.
[00:34:43.952 --> 00:34:44.853]  That's racketeering.
[00:34:44.853 --> 00:34:49.856]  That's organized crime, getting together to go set people up.
[00:34:49.856 --> 00:34:56.620]  And the black congressional caucus walked out in the Tea Party, tried to get them to spit on them, tried to get them to call them the N-word.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.861]  Nobody did that.
[00:34:57.861 --> 00:34:59.282]  The media ran with it and lied.
[00:34:59.882 --> 00:35:02.403]  This is the type of propaganda we're talking about.
[00:35:02.403 --> 00:35:03.603]  Gerald Salente is our guest.
[00:35:03.603 --> 00:35:12.044]  Your call is coming up right when we start the next hour and I've got other questions we're going to intersperse throughout that for Gerald Salente, picking his brain here at TrendsResearch.com.
[00:35:12.044 --> 00:35:15.665]  Don't forget we've got two new films coming out in the next week.
[00:35:15.665 --> 00:35:18.026]  One tomorrow premieres at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:18.026 --> 00:35:22.167]  The DVDs and the new film, Invisible Empire, New World Order Defined, are now shipping.
[00:35:22.167 --> 00:35:24.647]  Check out the trailers and info at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:24.647 --> 00:35:28.548]  Okay, Gerald, talking about the economy going under.
[00:35:30.635 --> 00:35:40.742]  I know you can't put an exact date on it, but a danger zone, A, B, is there a way to stop it, and C, when they implode it, what type of things are they going to try to steal?
[00:35:40.742 --> 00:35:48.308]  The timing is very tough, but we're looking for something really to happen between now and September.
[00:35:48.308 --> 00:35:59.536]  That's our window, because you're going to start seeing a lot more commercial real estate collapsing, you're going to start seeing more sovereign debt problems, and they're not going to be able to cover it up anymore.
[00:36:00.089 --> 00:36:09.412]  And of course the Fed is winding back on their 1.5 trillion that they're covering this whole housing bubble with.
[00:36:09.412 --> 00:36:11.813]  And that's winding down as well.
[00:36:11.813 --> 00:36:18.235]  So we're going to start seeing some very bad sales coming out in real estate as well.
[00:36:18.235 --> 00:36:19.516]  How can it be stopped?
[00:36:19.516 --> 00:36:22.477]  It can be stopped only a couple of ways.
[00:36:22.477 --> 00:36:22.997]  One is that
[00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:27.173]  We have to start doing business with each other.
[00:36:27.173 --> 00:36:31.838]  We're a country of over 300 million people, by American.
[00:36:31.838 --> 00:36:36.543]  And I'm not a protectionist, and I'm certainly not an isolationist.
[00:36:36.543 --> 00:36:37.985]  I travel the world.
[00:36:37.985 --> 00:36:41.569]  But I also have to support my neighbor, and my neighbors support me.
[00:36:42.028 --> 00:36:45.710]  Because if neither of us do good, we all do bad.
[00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:55.016]  And that's the way, really, as we can see it coming back in, is to rebuild this country brick by brick, manufacturing by manufacturer.
[00:36:55.016 --> 00:36:59.338]  It was wonderful to hear about that jeans company, Made in America.
[00:36:59.338 --> 00:37:05.642]  Anybody that's looking to get into business and to make a mark, sell Made in America.
[00:37:05.642 --> 00:37:08.303]  The country's yearning for it and really wants it.
[00:37:08.303 --> 00:37:08.984]  Number two,
[00:37:09.682 --> 00:37:13.804]  In how to bring it back is we need a productive capacity as well.
[00:37:13.804 --> 00:37:17.626]  And the best way we see it is with an alternative energy.
[00:37:17.626 --> 00:37:21.007]  But not wind, solar, geothermal, or biofuel.
[00:37:21.007 --> 00:37:22.508]  Something much bigger.
[00:37:22.508 --> 00:37:24.349]  And this isn't hyperbole.
[00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:29.491]  Go back to when we went in the 1990s and we were in a very severe recession.
[00:37:29.491 --> 00:37:33.893]  When Clinton got elected under the mantra, it's the economy stupid.
[00:37:33.893 --> 00:37:35.233]  What got us out?
[00:37:35.233 --> 00:37:36.734]  The internet revolution.
[00:37:37.182 --> 00:37:41.546]  Products were invented, designed, manufactured, marketed, serviced.
[00:37:41.546 --> 00:37:45.049]  We need that with a new energy product.
[00:37:45.049 --> 00:37:54.257]  And by the way, a magazine, I don't have the mentality for it, but for those that do have engineering experience, Infinite Energy.
[00:37:54.257 --> 00:38:01.103]  They're on the cutting edge with cold fusion, zero point energy, charge clusters, permanent magnets.
[00:38:01.557 --> 00:38:03.279]  Something like that, Alex.
[00:38:03.279 --> 00:38:05.922]  You can't print your way out of this.
[00:38:05.922 --> 00:38:08.786]  You can't, you can't spend out of it.
[00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:14.452]  Just like you or I. If we're deep in debt, we don't borrow more money.
[00:38:14.452 --> 00:38:16.214]  You can only innovate.
[00:38:16.214 --> 00:38:18.096]  You've got to innovate out of it.
[00:38:18.096 --> 00:38:18.677]  Exactly.
[00:38:20.683 --> 00:38:24.805]  When we come back, I want to briefly, well, we're going to take calls, then I'm going to ask you about NASA.
[00:38:24.805 --> 00:38:27.827]  And I'm not for spending $10 billion a year on NASA.
[00:38:27.827 --> 00:38:35.571]  But if you're going to give trillions to the banks, over a trillion bucks to the war every year, we can't have $10 billion for NASA?
[00:38:35.571 --> 00:38:39.012]  Again, everything's got to go to the war machine and the banks.
[00:38:39.012 --> 00:38:40.353]  It's killing America.
[00:38:40.353 --> 00:38:43.735]  We'll be back in one minute.
[00:38:43.735 --> 00:38:46.336]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:38:46.336 --> 00:38:48.557]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:38:52.059 --> 00:38:55.061]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:38:55.061 --> 00:39:00.403]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:39:00.403 --> 00:39:02.444]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:39:02.444 --> 00:39:07.447]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:39:07.447 --> 00:39:08.628]  How much do you want?
[00:39:08.628 --> 00:39:09.368]  When do you want it?
[00:39:09.748 --> 00:39:11.629]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:39:11.629 --> 00:39:12.710]  When will you need it?
[00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.911]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:39:14.911 --> 00:39:16.252]  Will there be any food?
[00:39:16.252 --> 00:39:17.773]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:39:17.773 --> 00:39:23.037]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:39:23.037 --> 00:39:26.179]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:39:26.619 --> 00:39:30.441]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:39:30.441 --> 00:39:31.662]  How much will you need?
[00:39:31.662 --> 00:39:32.583]  We don't know.
[00:39:32.583 --> 00:39:33.683]  How much do you want?
[00:39:33.683 --> 00:39:34.604]  All you can get.
[00:39:34.604 --> 00:39:35.704]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:39:35.704 --> 00:39:38.746]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:39:38.746 --> 00:39:40.527]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:39:40.527 --> 00:39:41.448]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:39:54.548 --> 00:39:56.929]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:39:56.929 --> 00:40:06.530]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.331]  This just went up on the Trudge Report.
[00:40:08.331 --> 00:40:10.871]  What have I been saying the last three days?
[00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:11.491]  Critics.
[00:40:11.491 --> 00:40:14.632]  Obama administration hyping terrorist attack.
[00:40:14.632 --> 00:40:16.552]  Nuclear terror attack.
[00:40:16.552 --> 00:40:16.732]  U.S.
[00:40:16.732 --> 00:40:19.873]  officials say the claim is not based on new intelligence.
[00:40:19.873 --> 00:40:23.794]  It is made up just like when Bush put it out.
[00:40:23.794 --> 00:40:24.114]  Okay?
[00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:27.034]  Now there could be some real terror attacks.
[00:40:27.034 --> 00:40:29.678]  That's somebody fighting back like Pakistan.
[00:40:29.678 --> 00:40:33.023]  Or if we attack Iran, they've said we're gonna attack back.
[00:40:33.792 --> 00:40:46.696]  But Gerald Solente, I'm no fan of Iran, I'm America first, but it's not America, it's banks and corporations leading us into these wars that are black holes they steal money out of if they use as political distractions.
[00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:52.757]  I mean, if our country attacks Iran, I mean, what do people expect Iran to do?
[00:40:52.757 --> 00:40:54.058]  I mean, to lay there and take it?
[00:40:54.058 --> 00:41:01.300]  I mean, since when do you, I mean, it'd be like Nazi Germany attacking England and England not fighting back.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:01.980]  Or it'd be like,
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:07.604]  You know, it's just so asinine, Gerald.
[00:41:07.604 --> 00:41:08.685]  Yes, it is.
[00:41:08.685 --> 00:41:11.788]  And again, let's look at the history of Iran.
[00:41:11.788 --> 00:41:13.309]  First of all, these are the Persians.
[00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:14.971]  They're not going anywhere.
[00:41:14.971 --> 00:41:17.553]  There are 75 million of them.
[00:41:17.553 --> 00:41:19.534]  And, you know, what have they really done?
[00:41:19.534 --> 00:41:24.398]  I don't think they, in the last century, they haven't colonized anybody.
[00:41:24.398 --> 00:41:27.181]  They didn't attack another, invade another country.
[00:41:27.765 --> 00:41:46.583]  I mean, when you look at the people that are pointing the fingers at Iran, particularly the United States, France and Israel, you know, their track record of colonization, starting wars, invading countries and occupying them is a lot worse than Iran's is.
[00:41:46.583 --> 00:41:49.726]  So why all of a sudden Iran?
[00:41:49.726 --> 00:41:51.988]  And what if they do get a nuclear weapon?
[00:41:53.496 --> 00:41:54.857]  Well what are they going to do with it?
[00:41:54.857 --> 00:41:56.899]  They're going to attack somebody with it?
[00:41:56.899 --> 00:42:00.943]  Everyone knows that if they used it, they'd be annihilated.
[00:42:00.943 --> 00:42:04.186]  So this is really to get the people angry.
[00:42:04.186 --> 00:42:04.627]  We need
[00:42:05.103 --> 00:42:07.124]  Communism is gone.
[00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:11.126]  The Germans, you know, during World War II is long over.
[00:42:11.126 --> 00:42:15.389]  The Japanese, we don't have any more to point fingers at.
[00:42:15.389 --> 00:42:18.951]  And now they're looking at the Iranians and North Koreans.
[00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:28.876]  So when we're talking, by the way, of what's going to bring the economy down, if we have a terrorist strike, this economy goes to zero.
[00:42:30.425 --> 00:42:35.327]  We go down an economic dark hole that we'll never be able to pull out of.
[00:42:35.327 --> 00:42:37.947]  Because go back to 9-11.
[00:42:37.947 --> 00:42:39.948]  We were in a recession.
[00:42:39.948 --> 00:42:54.392]  Right after 9-11, Alan, the Genius Greens fan, who admits he's wrong 30% of the time, a C average, he began to lower interest rates to 46-year lows.
[00:42:54.392 --> 00:42:58.494]  We can't do that anymore to juice the economy.
[00:42:58.494 --> 00:43:00.014]  If there's a terrorist strike,
[00:43:00.529 --> 00:43:09.537]  We see an economic terror that will drive this country into the greatest depression a lot faster than we're forecasting.
[00:43:09.537 --> 00:43:12.380]  But the banks will love that because they're waging war against Main Street.
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.761]  They love things falling apart.
[00:43:13.761 --> 00:43:16.444]  They get to pose as a savior and consolidate society.
[00:43:17.363 --> 00:43:18.644]  Well, the banks are the banks.
[00:43:18.644 --> 00:43:22.286]  You know, they're going to make money any way they can.
[00:43:22.286 --> 00:43:28.751]  We don't have to worry about them going anywhere because when we get into trouble, you know, we bail them out.
[00:43:28.751 --> 00:43:39.398]  And again, go back to the quotes of Smedley Butler and others who knew the deal and knew what this whole thing is about.
[00:43:39.398 --> 00:43:43.300]  It's about people making a lot of money and doing dirty deals.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.602]  And the banks are the ones that wash the money.
[00:43:46.804 --> 00:43:51.805]  Absolutely, and that's why Reuters even admits Russia said, okay, kill the poppy fields.
[00:43:51.805 --> 00:43:56.166]  It's up over 12 times what it was nine years ago.
[00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:56.766]  And the U.S.
[00:43:56.766 --> 00:43:59.766]  and NATO said, no, we're going to let them grow and sell the opium.
[00:43:59.766 --> 00:44:04.527]  I mean, it's out in the open, but then cops will raid your house looking for a marijuana cigarette.
[00:44:04.527 --> 00:44:06.128]  We're going directly to your calls when we come back.
[00:44:06.128 --> 00:44:08.668]  I'm going to play a trailer for Invisible Empire that premieres tomorrow.
[00:44:08.668 --> 00:44:10.048]  We're going right to your calls.
[00:44:10.048 --> 00:44:12.989]  I'm going to stop hogging Gerald Cilente for myself.
[00:44:13.769 --> 00:44:17.892]  Until about 45 after in the next hour, then I'm going to blitz through a whole bunch of questions.
[00:44:17.892 --> 00:44:23.597]  You can also send your questions to our Twitter account, twitter.com forward slash TheRealAlexJones.
[00:44:23.597 --> 00:44:27.560]  Your questions for Gerald Cilente via Twitter as well.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.883]  On the other side of this quick break, be sure and visit his website, TrendsResearch.com.
[00:44:31.883 --> 00:44:35.386]  And if you want to buy a subscription, either digital or to the hard copy, believe me,
[00:44:35.846 --> 00:44:36.446]  I know a lot.
[00:44:36.446 --> 00:44:37.247]  I research a lot.
[00:44:37.247 --> 00:44:38.467]  I spend four or five hours a day.
[00:44:38.467 --> 00:44:39.548]  That's no exaggeration.
[00:44:39.548 --> 00:44:40.108]  Sometimes more.
[00:44:40.108 --> 00:44:41.569]  I'm pretty addicted to info.
[00:44:41.569 --> 00:44:42.509]  Total info junkie.
[00:44:42.509 --> 00:44:43.250]  Factoid junkie.
[00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.230]  History junkie.
[00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:46.632]  I learn something every time I read the Trends Forecaster.
[00:44:46.632 --> 00:44:48.713]  I learn something every time I talk to Gerald Cilente.
[00:44:48.713 --> 00:44:51.634]  We can all learn a lot more from him and all learn together.
[00:44:51.634 --> 00:44:52.274]  So that's coming up.
[00:44:52.274 --> 00:44:56.156]  Be sure and subscribe to the Trends Journal at TrendsResearch.com.
[00:44:56.156 --> 00:44:56.877]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:44:56.877 --> 00:45:00.158]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.TV and InfoWars.com.
[00:45:00.158 --> 00:45:01.279]  We're premiering two new films.
[00:45:02.748 --> 00:45:11.212]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:45:11.212 --> 00:45:22.118]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:45:22.118 --> 00:45:27.541]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:45:28.101 --> 00:45:32.984]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[00:45:32.984 --> 00:45:42.070]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:52.177]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[00:45:52.177 --> 00:45:55.860]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.860]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:46:01.445 --> 00:46:02.746]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:02.746 --> 00:46:08.351]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:46:08.351 --> 00:46:13.355]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:46:13.355 --> 00:46:13.836]  It's true.
[00:46:13.836 --> 00:46:18.400]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:24.164]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:46:24.164 --> 00:46:26.465]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:46:26.465 --> 00:46:31.268]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:46:31.268 --> 00:46:32.389]  And here's the best part.
[00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:35.451]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:46:35.451 --> 00:46:39.094]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:46:39.094 --> 00:46:42.276]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:46:42.276 --> 00:46:44.497]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:46:44.497 --> 00:46:45.418]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.022]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:46:52.022 --> 00:46:58.126]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:46:58.126 --> 00:47:01.568]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:47:01.568 --> 00:47:08.213]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:47:08.213 --> 00:47:13.356]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:47:13.356 --> 00:47:14.857]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:47:17.423 --> 00:47:28.299]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They soak pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:47:30.461 --> 00:47:35.163]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:47:35.163 --> 00:47:38.984]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:47:38.984 --> 00:47:40.225]  Utter stone.
[00:47:40.225 --> 00:47:42.386]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:47:42.386 --> 00:47:44.167]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:47:44.167 --> 00:47:47.048]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:47:47.048 --> 00:47:53.670]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:56.371]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:47:56.371 --> 00:47:58.732]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:47:58.732 --> 00:47:59.253]  Others don't.
[00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:07.298]  Adolf Hitler, he wanted a world government.
[00:48:07.298 --> 00:48:12.023]  With himself as the master leader.
[00:48:21.076 --> 00:48:29.947]  One small central authority of individuals can then dictate a policy that's going to be distributed down to the rest of the world, everywhere.
[00:48:29.947 --> 00:48:34.393]  The Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the world's superclass.
[00:48:35.353 --> 00:48:42.418]  This documentary chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:48:42.418 --> 00:48:52.666]  We've become accustomed to the idea that every now and then something is going to happen and we just know from the beginning we're not going to get to the bottom of it.
[00:48:54.429 --> 00:49:03.258]  Learn how this global oligarchy controls the populace through drug trafficking, money laundering, staged terror attacks, media propaganda and debt.
[00:49:03.258 --> 00:49:11.186]  Americans are easily motivated by false flag operations and I think it's inevitable that we will see false flag operations in the near future.
[00:49:11.186 --> 00:49:12.948]  Witness their plan for a global tax.
[00:49:13.468 --> 00:49:18.598]  And a cashless surveillance society in which every man, woman, and child is microchipped at birth.
[00:49:18.598 --> 00:49:25.731]  A network Washington set up to run arms to the Congress wound up running cocaine for the most vicious drug cartel in the world.
[00:49:29.824 --> 00:49:35.308]  Barney Frank acknowledged having used a male prostitute, whom he then hired as a personal employee.
[00:49:35.308 --> 00:49:38.191]  And he ran a prostitution business out of Frank's home.
[00:49:38.191 --> 00:49:45.617]  If you look at the elite throughout history, many of the people that achieve pinnacles of power are into the occult.
[00:49:45.617 --> 00:49:48.219]  Stories about what happens in these redwoods are hard to come by.
[00:49:55.267 --> 00:49:57.269]  Invisible Empire.
[00:49:57.269 --> 00:49:59.651]  A new world order to find.

[00:50:17.366 --> 00:50:21.810]  Later in the show, if I have time, why am I playing Odd Couple music?
[00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:25.876]  Newt Gingrich is in trouble.
[00:50:25.876 --> 00:50:28.760]  Republicans are now realizing he was for the banker bailout.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:34.207]  He runs TV ads pushing for global warming taxes with Nancy Pelosi.
[00:50:34.207 --> 00:50:36.089]  These are not odd couples.
[00:50:36.089 --> 00:50:41.537]  The left and right at the top of the power structure work together looting the people and that is exposed
[00:50:42.557 --> 00:50:48.520]  In the upcoming film that premieres in about 25 hours, less than 25 hours, tomorrow when the show ends at 3 p.m.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.560]  Central, 4 p.m.

[00:51:07.486 --> 00:51:11.770]  Gerald Salente, let's now go ahead and go to some phone calls.
[00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:15.233]  Let's talk to Trip in Florida, who's been holding patiently.
[00:51:15.233 --> 00:51:20.798]  You're on the air with the number one trends forecaster of TrendsResearch.com, Gerald Salente.
[00:51:20.798 --> 00:51:23.000]  Hey Alex and Gerald, how are y'all?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.101]  We're all right.
[00:51:24.101 --> 00:51:24.682]  All right.
[00:51:24.682 --> 00:51:30.167]  I was wondering about China's involvement in all this.
[00:51:30.167 --> 00:51:32.809]  I saw mainstream media yesterday that
[00:51:34.252 --> 00:51:38.336]  China was gonna back us up in this whole Iran business.
[00:51:38.336 --> 00:51:41.399]  So, um, that kinda makes me nervous.
[00:51:41.399 --> 00:51:46.584]  Yeah, how does China play into the big picture economically, militarily, everything?
[00:51:46.584 --> 00:51:53.511]  Well, China is only going to go so far with Iran because they're doing a lot of business with them.
[00:51:53.511 --> 00:51:55.693]  And China's holding all the cards.
[00:51:55.693 --> 00:51:56.815]  They're holding all our debt.
[00:51:58.047 --> 00:52:02.870]  So we really have to play the China game, not the other way around.
[00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.932]  And that's what we're really looking at.
[00:52:04.932 --> 00:52:17.621]  And all this noise, by the way, about letting the yuan float so that American exports can be more competitive, meaning that it is going to cost more to buy Chinese products.
[00:52:17.621 --> 00:52:20.543]  That's only for public consumption.
[00:52:20.543 --> 00:52:21.043]  China's
[00:52:21.462 --> 00:52:25.666]  Producing stuff at slave labor wages.
[00:52:25.666 --> 00:52:31.150]  If their currency goes up a little bit, it's not like everybody's going to be buying U.S.
[00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:32.171]  products.
[00:52:32.171 --> 00:52:35.114]  So China's really the ace in the hole over here.
[00:52:35.114 --> 00:52:43.501]  Because the other problem with China is, last year for example, they had 70,000.
[00:52:43.501 --> 00:52:46.123]  70,000 major disturbances and riots.
[00:52:46.123 --> 00:52:49.086]  If the Chinese economy doesn't keep perking along,
[00:52:49.622 --> 00:52:53.144]  They have 1.2 billion problems on their hands.
[00:52:53.144 --> 00:52:55.325]  And let's not forget this.
[00:52:55.325 --> 00:53:11.976]  One of the only reasons why this economy didn't crash worse than it has, and quicker than it has, is because China has been throwing trillions of dollars into pumping up their economy, and by extension, the world economy.
[00:53:11.976 --> 00:53:17.659]  So now when China, as they're doing now, starts to wind back, the economy starts to slow up.
[00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:20.403]  Because we don't have a real economy.
[00:53:20.403 --> 00:53:28.125]  We have a parasite banking economy, a global banking dictatorship, and now we have no more denial about world government.
[00:53:28.125 --> 00:53:38.989]  We have Gordon Brown, Obama saying we're going to have a planetary regime with carbon taxes paid to private banks under a global constitution where the banks will be the government.
[00:53:38.989 --> 00:53:42.651]  I mean, this is moving faster than I even thought it would.
[00:53:42.651 --> 00:53:46.592]  I don't see how they're going to get away with this open tyranny, Gerald.
[00:53:46.592 --> 00:53:48.113]  Well, they're getting away with it now.
[00:53:48.886 --> 00:53:51.286]  And again, we've said this over and over again.
[00:53:51.286 --> 00:53:56.487]  The merger of state and corporate powers is fascism.
[00:53:56.487 --> 00:54:00.628]  And what happens when you live under a fascist dictator?
[00:54:00.628 --> 00:54:02.848]  You don't get out of line.
[00:54:02.848 --> 00:54:03.429]  Anything else?
[00:54:03.429 --> 00:54:05.429]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:54:05.429 --> 00:54:08.029]  No, and that's what they're doing now.
[00:54:08.029 --> 00:54:09.030]  Anything else, Tripp?
[00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:11.330]  Police State 4.
[00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:11.950]  Absolutely.
[00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:13.310]  Thank you.
[00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:14.851]  Thank you, I appreciate the call, Tripp.
[00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:16.731]  Justin in West Virginia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:54:18.703 --> 00:54:20.504]  Yeah, hey guys, how you doing?
[00:54:20.504 --> 00:54:21.305]  Alright, go ahead, sir.
[00:54:21.305 --> 00:54:30.151]  Um, I was just wanting to read a couple sentences from a story that someone wrote about the health bill, and then I was gonna ask the question to, uh, Gerald.
[00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:37.897]  Yeah, that's one of my later questions is the health care bill, his analysis of it, but go ahead and read your point.
[00:54:37.897 --> 00:54:46.663]  Uh, he put in there, insurance companies can no longer drop clients who become sick, giving them lifetime coverage, pre-existing medical conditions,
[00:54:47.498 --> 00:54:49.882]  Uh, people will still be available.
[00:54:49.882 --> 00:54:55.030]  And at the end, he said, Vice-Inspector C will be sure to go up and it'll help.
[00:54:57.065 --> 00:55:00.806]  Make the economy better by having less people file for bankruptcy.
[00:55:00.806 --> 00:55:09.647]  And my question was, what does Gerald think about how the health bill is going to fit in with the crash that he predicts is coming up?
[00:55:09.647 --> 00:55:12.828]  Gerald, give us your breakdown of the health care bill.
[00:55:12.828 --> 00:55:15.828]  Well, the health care bill is not going to accelerate the crash.
[00:55:15.828 --> 00:55:18.109]  That's a minor player in it, although it's a big one.
[00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:22.050]  That's a health care bill, again, another example of fascism.
[00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.490]  We're being forced to buy insurance
[00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:27.592]  From criminal insurance companies?
[00:55:27.592 --> 00:55:29.834]  How could you make this stuff up?
[00:55:29.834 --> 00:55:31.175]  And what is it going to do?
[00:55:31.175 --> 00:55:33.557]  Perpetuate a failing system.
[00:55:33.557 --> 00:55:36.259]  Look at the condition of the American people.
[00:55:36.259 --> 00:55:37.340]  What are we doing?
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:44.146]  We're going to be dumping more money into a system whereby the people are in very bad shape themselves, not taking care of themselves.
[00:55:44.551 --> 00:55:46.092]  They're addicted to drugs!
[00:55:46.092 --> 00:55:47.894]  Turn on the television!
[00:55:47.894 --> 00:55:48.494]  I love it!
[00:55:48.494 --> 00:55:49.355]  What is this?
[00:55:49.355 --> 00:55:50.736]  Fibromyalgia?
[00:55:50.736 --> 00:55:52.498]  One of them I'm watching?
[00:55:52.498 --> 00:55:56.261]  You know, I guess that replaced Epstein-Barr disease.
[00:55:56.261 --> 00:56:04.548]  They keep making up these things so people become hypochondriacs, and then they have the disclaimer, you can't make this stuff up!
[00:56:04.548 --> 00:56:07.150]  A side effect is suicide!
[00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:10.173]  So all this is, is a system
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:17.586]  To keep the people in control, to make them think that they're doing something for them, and they're robbing us.
[00:56:17.586 --> 00:56:23.952]  They're taxing us to take our money to give it to the insurance companies.
[00:56:23.952 --> 00:56:26.134]  Again, you could not make this up.
[00:56:26.134 --> 00:56:27.616]  It's fascism.
[00:56:27.616 --> 00:56:28.156]  Absolutely.
[00:56:28.156 --> 00:56:32.921]  Let me give you my take on it, which mirrors what Gerald is saying, and good points, Justin.
[00:56:32.921 --> 00:56:35.303]  There's a war going on.
[00:56:36.107 --> 00:56:37.248]  Of lies and truth.
[00:56:52.205 --> 00:56:53.286]  I'm not a Republican.
[00:56:53.286 --> 00:56:54.047]  I'm not a Democrat.
[00:56:54.047 --> 00:56:55.188]  I'm a freedom lover.
[00:56:55.188 --> 00:56:56.609]  I'm a truth teller.
[00:56:56.609 --> 00:56:59.492]  I have read the five different versions of the bill, the past bill.
[00:56:59.492 --> 00:57:01.193]  I've scanned over the key sections.
[00:57:01.193 --> 00:57:02.895]  I've had congressmen on.
[00:57:02.895 --> 00:57:03.495]  I've read it.
[00:57:03.495 --> 00:57:05.057]  And then after the fact, they admitted it.
[00:57:05.057 --> 00:57:06.638]  No one's getting free health care.
[00:57:06.638 --> 00:57:09.561]  It doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.
[00:57:09.561 --> 00:57:11.242]  In fact, pull up the AP.
[00:57:11.242 --> 00:57:14.145]  It says, what was the headline, the exact headline?
[00:57:14.145 --> 00:57:18.329]  It was oversight in bill
[00:57:19.477 --> 00:57:20.598]  Like it was a mistake.
[00:57:20.598 --> 00:57:22.560]  Oh, it didn't give you coverage.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.822]  It makes 30 plus million people buy coverage.
[00:57:24.822 --> 00:57:27.004]  It lets the insurance companies lower the standard.
[00:57:27.004 --> 00:57:29.826]  It allows them to raise premiums.
[00:57:29.826 --> 00:57:31.047]  They're saying over 32% right now, 39% on average.
[00:57:33.593 --> 00:57:35.635]  In California, that's AP today.
[00:57:35.635 --> 00:57:36.736]  I covered it in the first hour.
[00:57:36.736 --> 00:57:36.916]  39%.
[00:57:36.916 --> 00:57:40.179]  It makes you get it.
[00:57:40.179 --> 00:57:44.944]  You've seen the VA run health care, but this isn't government health care as Ron Paul said.
[00:57:44.944 --> 00:57:46.805]  It's corporate health care.
[00:57:46.805 --> 00:57:51.750]  It's the government, though, dictating what doctors can do and what they can't do.
[00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:53.311]  Gerald Cilente.
[00:57:53.311 --> 00:57:53.912]  Oh, you hit it.
[00:57:53.912 --> 00:57:55.753]  You covered all the points.
[00:57:55.753 --> 00:57:56.895]  Let's take another call here.
[00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:00.972]  There's that other one too.
[00:58:00.972 --> 00:58:01.733]  What is that?
[00:58:01.733 --> 00:58:05.778]  That army of doctors that they're now putting together?
[00:58:05.778 --> 00:58:12.687]  Another military wing that's allowed to really become a militia?
[00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:17.316]  A government militia of doctors that they're also having that bill.
[00:58:17.316 --> 00:58:25.645]  And they say federally they've got to report parents to CPS and ask the kids questions, but the point I forgot to make is it's a war of truth and lies.
[00:58:25.645 --> 00:58:30.571]  I was watching Hardball two nights ago and everything coming out of Matthew's mouth was a lie.
[00:58:31.192 --> 00:58:33.154]  That's why the guy's got 400,000 viewers.
[00:58:33.154 --> 00:58:37.898]  Folks, this radio show, conservatively, has double that every day.
[00:58:37.898 --> 00:58:39.240]  This guy's a joke.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:46.567]  No one is watching Anderson Cooper, and no one is watching these people on CNN, MSNBC.
[00:58:46.567 --> 00:58:51.032]  CNN's lost more than half its ratings in the last year because people are getting wise to him.
[00:58:51.032 --> 00:58:52.814]  But, Gerald, I still can't believe
[00:58:53.314 --> 00:58:59.716]  Him saying, there's no rationing, there's no death panels when it does have the bioethics panels.
[00:58:59.716 --> 00:59:02.956]  Tom Daschle said, we will cut care to the old people.
[00:59:02.956 --> 00:59:05.917]  I mean, don't they know the public's gonna find out they're lying?
[00:59:05.917 --> 00:59:07.317]  I mean, it's just such lying.
[00:59:07.317 --> 00:59:09.018]  They're hacks.
[00:59:09.018 --> 00:59:09.798]  I mean, let's face it.
[00:59:09.798 --> 00:59:11.158]  Look at what they represent.
[00:59:11.158 --> 00:59:12.579]  Look where they come from.
[00:59:12.579 --> 00:59:14.539]  By their deeds, you shall know them.
[00:59:14.539 --> 00:59:16.700]  You go through the whole list of these guys.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:19.120]  These TV tough guys, these big mouths.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:21.161]  And they're just playing to the crowd.
[00:59:21.161 --> 00:59:22.841]  And he's, you know, he's one of the crowd.
[00:59:24.301 --> 00:59:29.946]  We're going to come back and take some more calls, but when we come back, I first want to ask Gerald Cilente, because I'm interested in his take.
[00:59:29.946 --> 00:59:33.209]  Time Magazine, Newsweek, I'll ask the question and I'll get the answer when we come back.
[00:59:33.209 --> 00:59:43.818]  Time Magazine, London Guardian, Newsweek, Southern Poverty Law Center, every publication run by George Soros, are lying and saying I'm calling for violence and I'm dangerous.
[00:59:44.685 --> 00:59:49.348]  Why are they singling me out more really than anybody else now on a daily basis?
[00:59:49.348 --> 00:59:52.250]  What does Gerald think that is really all about?
[00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:57.774]  Because I really want to get his take on it, and I want to ask him if he's had any threats or demonization out there as well.
[00:59:57.774 --> 01:00:01.396]  Then we're going right back to your phone calls, Ron, Scott, Pamela, and others.
[01:00:14.525 --> 01:00:24.133]  Introducing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:29.377]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills, and off-the-grid living.
[01:00:29.677 --> 01:00:45.128]  Off the Grid News is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns, with absolutely no apologies.
[01:00:45.128 --> 01:00:49.751]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[01:00:49.751 --> 01:00:53.934]  That's right, free for our listeners who sign up at offthegridnews.com.
[01:00:53.934 --> 01:00:54.855]  That's Off the Grid
[01:00:55.275 --> 01:01:04.499]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:01:04.499 --> 01:01:06.900]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:10.121]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:01:10.121 --> 01:01:15.223]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:01:15.223 --> 01:01:19.405]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:01:19.725 --> 01:01:22.069]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:24.953]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:01:24.953 --> 01:01:27.877]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:01:27.877 --> 01:01:35.489]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:41.190]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:44.031]  Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:47.732]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:01:47.732 --> 01:01:48.812]  And I got news for you.
[01:01:48.812 --> 01:01:50.153]  You're everyone else.
[01:01:50.153 --> 01:01:51.653]  Invisible Empire.

[01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:04.380]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:08.523]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at worst depression?
[01:02:08.523 --> 01:02:10.785]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:02:10.785 --> 01:02:15.949]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:02:15.949 --> 01:02:17.771]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S.
[01:02:17.771 --> 01:02:19.312]  Treasuries are a safe haven.
[01:02:19.312 --> 01:02:20.813]  But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:02:20.813 --> 01:02:23.856]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[01:02:24.156 --> 01:02:29.538]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:38.883]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks, featuring full color illustrations, weights, and measures.
[01:02:38.883 --> 01:02:41.204]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:02:44.045 --> 01:02:47.526]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.
[01:02:47.526 --> 01:02:54.088]  Discover how gold may be right for you and your IRA by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:02:54.088 --> 01:02:57.409]  Whether buying or it's time for you to sell, the book is free.
[01:02:57.409 --> 01:02:57.849]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:02:57.849 --> 01:03:03.490]  Let's talk tough.
[01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:04.891]  Let's talk comfort.
[01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:12.233]  Let's talk about down-home value, made in the USA blue jeans, like you wore as a kid.
[01:03:12.233 --> 01:03:12.633]  Remember?
[01:03:13.106 --> 01:03:37.333]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it
[01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:42.671]  For good old-fashioned comfort, get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:03:42.671 --> 01:03:44.172]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[01:03:44.172 --> 01:03:47.434]  In our Defender motorcycle jean comes Kevlar reinforced.
[01:03:47.434 --> 01:03:48.255]  See them at gusset.com.
[01:03:48.255 --> 01:03:49.416]  That's gusset.com.
[01:03:49.416 --> 01:03:49.976]  Or call 888-848-7738.
[01:03:49.976 --> 01:03:50.216]  That's 888-848-7738.
[01:03:50.216 --> 01:03:51.157]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:03:51.157 --> 01:03:51.537]  Others don't.
[01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:23.072]  Continuing with your phone calls with Gerald Salente in this extended two-hour interview.
[01:04:23.072 --> 01:04:26.573]  We've got about 35 minutes left with him today.
[01:04:26.573 --> 01:04:27.893]  Top Trends Forecaster.
[01:04:27.893 --> 01:04:35.155]  Gerald, again, I'm selfishly asking you the question, but also it lets us understand politically what they're concerned about.
[01:04:35.155 --> 01:04:36.656]  I'm not in the left-right paradigm.
[01:04:36.656 --> 01:04:38.677]  I'm a political atheist like yourself.
[01:04:38.677 --> 01:04:39.937]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:04:40.805 --> 01:04:44.746]  They're trying to demonize the Tea Party, anybody that criticizes the banks.
[01:04:44.746 --> 01:04:51.827]  Three years ago, you predicted there'd be these grassroots protests and rebellions against taxation, against the banks.
[01:04:51.827 --> 01:04:53.147]  That's now unfolding.
[01:04:53.147 --> 01:04:56.828]  Why do you think they're singling me out particularly?
[01:04:56.828 --> 01:05:00.069]  I mean, if a cop gets shot, they say it's my fault with no evidence.
[01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:04.629]  Why do you think we're a year into this program of demonization?
[01:05:04.629 --> 01:05:07.630]  Because you're making a difference and you're waking people up.
[01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:11.705]  And you're speaking to what a lot of people feel.
[01:05:11.705 --> 01:05:14.206]  And they don't want that to happen.
[01:05:14.206 --> 01:05:17.928]  So, it's logical that they would do that.
[01:05:17.928 --> 01:05:22.229]  They want to stop the force that has the most power.
[01:05:22.229 --> 01:05:25.831]  And it's like cutting off the head of a snake.
[01:05:25.831 --> 01:05:29.372]  They feel as though if they could stop you, they could stop the movement.
[01:05:29.372 --> 01:05:32.813]  In a lot of ways, because you're at the forefront of it.
[01:05:32.813 --> 01:05:37.155]  And they're going to continue to do it and demonize everybody that they can
[01:05:37.677 --> 01:05:40.460]  That exposes the fraud going on.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:49.107]  I remember talking about what was going on about how this DC heist, we called it, Wall Street hijacks Washington.
[01:05:49.107 --> 01:05:54.272]  How when we first said that, it was considered outrageous that we would think that.
[01:05:54.272 --> 01:06:04.641]  So anytime that you begin to expose the fraud, the criminality, and the corruption, they want to shut you down because you cost them a lot of money and a lot of problems.
[01:06:05.876 --> 01:06:11.098]  But why would all these major TV networks and publications say I'm calling for violence?
[01:06:11.098 --> 01:06:14.779]  And Fox admitted in a news article, too, they wrote they called Homeland Security on us.
[01:06:14.779 --> 01:06:20.161]  I don't know if you knew this two weeks ago, off comments on a message board implying that they were ours.
[01:06:20.161 --> 01:06:25.923]  Then we found far worse comments on Fox Nation's own website, their own pundits even saying more.
[01:06:25.923 --> 01:06:29.304]  Do you think they're getting ready to set me up, or is this just to demonize me?
[01:06:29.304 --> 01:06:33.145]  I mean, because it looks like they're trying to sic the cops and the IRS on me.
[01:06:33.902 --> 01:06:44.445]  Well, they're probably well aware of that already, and they're just gonna look for any kind of breach that they could give an excuse to come in with, just like they do with everyone else.
[01:06:44.445 --> 01:06:54.968]  So, it's again, you know, you said it before, the only thing you have in this life is your word, and your dignity, and that's all you leave behind is your word.
[01:06:54.968 --> 01:06:57.189]  So, of course, there's always the threat.
[01:06:57.189 --> 01:06:59.569]  I mean, I have to tell you, back in 2002,
[01:07:01.877 --> 01:07:06.541]  In the Trends Journal in my column, I wrote, it's getting dangerous.
[01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:17.949]  And I said that I'm going to be careful what I say, because when they come out from the government saying, and you remember during the Bush years, you're either with us or against us.
[01:07:17.949 --> 01:07:20.351]  And you have to be careful what you say.
[01:07:20.351 --> 01:07:23.273]  And we're entering into a period like that.
[01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:24.835]  And I make this really clear.
[01:07:24.835 --> 01:07:29.038]  I'm not willing to die for my country, because what is my country?
[01:07:29.488 --> 01:07:33.729]  My country certainly isn't the Democrats or the Republicans.
[01:07:33.729 --> 01:07:43.651]  So when do you say, hey listen, knock yourself out, do what you want to do, but I'm not going to take shots for anybody.
[01:07:43.651 --> 01:07:45.291]  I make that really clear.
[01:07:45.291 --> 01:07:49.972]  And I make it very clear that we're calling for an intellectual revolution.
[01:07:49.972 --> 01:07:57.034]  So what I would suggest you continue to do, every chance you can, is to say we want a peaceful change.
[01:07:58.413 --> 01:08:01.754]  You see, here's what's going on, Alex.
[01:08:01.754 --> 01:08:06.396]  The more they lose control, the harder they're going to clamp down.
[01:08:06.396 --> 01:08:08.617]  And this is what the people need to know.
[01:08:08.617 --> 01:08:20.842]  And that's why we're saying, the more that they start losing, the more control that slips away, they're going to create a violent situation so they can crack down on it.
[01:08:20.842 --> 01:08:26.925]  And do you agree that they're clearly trying to provocateur, well they've been caught, violence and that they want it to get violent?
[01:08:27.808 --> 01:08:31.389]  I don't know if they want to, but I know that nothing I... Read my lips.
[01:08:31.389 --> 01:08:32.329]  No new taxes.
[01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:34.690]  I didn't have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:36.030]  I smoked, but I didn't inhale.
[01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:38.611]  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction.
[01:08:38.611 --> 01:08:39.651]  I'm no crook.
[01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:42.492]  How can anybody believe anything they say?
[01:08:42.492 --> 01:08:45.153]  Remember the name, the Gulf of Tonkin?
[01:08:45.153 --> 01:08:46.773]  One lie built after another.
[01:08:47.193 --> 01:08:50.115]  These are psychopaths and sociopaths.
[01:08:50.115 --> 01:09:00.122]  Look at this guy, this, this, uh, what, Edwards, John Edwards, whiter than white, you know, talking about morality and he gets caught with a chick.
[01:09:00.122 --> 01:09:03.365]  I mean, Spitzer, I talked to that one after another.
[01:09:03.365 --> 01:09:06.527]  Look up the definition of a sociopath.
[01:09:06.947 --> 01:09:10.690]  This is who they are, and this is the way they behave.
[01:09:10.690 --> 01:09:13.973]  They will do anything to maintain their control.
[01:09:13.973 --> 01:09:25.422]  They act with all of the respectability and dignity on the tele- on- on- in front of the folks, and then behind the scenes, they're doing their dirty little stuff.
[01:09:26.002 --> 01:09:28.844]  And again, and they're not even man enough to admit it.
[01:09:28.844 --> 01:09:38.471]  Whoever made up this stuff, that as soon as you get caught having sex, you're promised you're gonna go for sex addiction therapy.
[01:09:38.471 --> 01:09:43.234]  When did they make this sex addiction therapy thing up?
[01:09:43.234 --> 01:09:44.575]  Yeah, well, and exactly.
[01:09:44.575 --> 01:09:49.479]  The media makes it a big deal about sex with women as they steal trillions of dollars.
[01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:50.840]  I mean, what's the real crime here?
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.642]  We'll be right back with... We're on the march.
[01:09:53.642 --> 01:09:55.163]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:09:56.161 --> 01:10:01.585]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:10:01.585 --> 01:10:05.808]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:10:05.808 --> 01:10:07.069]  Tyranny is here.
[01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:10.712]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:10:10.712 --> 01:10:13.234]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:10:13.234 --> 01:10:19.098]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:10:19.098 --> 01:10:25.323]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:10:25.743 --> 01:10:31.728]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:35.911]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:10:35.911 --> 01:10:40.194]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:46.138]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:10:46.138 --> 01:10:49.701]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:10:49.701 --> 01:10:51.682]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:10:51.682 --> 01:10:52.123]  It's here.

[01:11:02.045 --> 01:11:05.065]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:11:05.065 --> 01:11:10.406]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:11:10.406 --> 01:11:12.447]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:11:12.447 --> 01:11:17.428]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:11:17.428 --> 01:11:18.628]  How much do you want?
[01:11:18.628 --> 01:11:19.368]  When do you want it?
[01:11:19.748 --> 01:11:21.630]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:22.711]  When will you need it?
[01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:24.914]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:26.255]  Will there be any food?
[01:11:26.255 --> 01:11:27.777]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:11:27.777 --> 01:11:33.042]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:11:33.042 --> 01:11:36.626]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:40.110]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:41.670]  How much will you need?
[01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:42.571]  We don't know.
[01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:43.671]  How much do you want?
[01:11:43.671 --> 01:11:44.591]  All you can get.
[01:11:44.591 --> 01:11:45.691]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:11:45.691 --> 01:11:48.752]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:11:48.752 --> 01:11:50.513]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:11:50.513 --> 01:11:51.433]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:02.592]  What's your home worth?
[01:12:02.592 --> 01:12:04.712]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[01:12:04.712 --> 01:12:07.754]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[01:12:07.754 --> 01:12:15.477]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[01:12:15.477 --> 01:12:19.119]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[01:12:19.119 --> 01:12:21.580]  It's so easy, and best of all, it's free.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:24.581]  At HomeGain.com, you can compare realtors anonymously.
[01:12:24.861 --> 01:12:25.302]  Let's do it!
[01:12:41.621 --> 01:12:42.802]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
[01:13:15.147 --> 01:13:18.068]  Continuing with your phone calls for Gerald Cilente.
[01:13:18.068 --> 01:13:23.930]  Then I've got some other questions I want to ask him and some Twitter questions as well.
[01:13:23.930 --> 01:13:26.511]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Texas.
[01:13:26.511 --> 01:13:27.331]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:13:27.331 --> 01:13:28.271]  Go ahead.
[01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:29.251]  It's always a pleasure.
[01:13:29.251 --> 01:13:32.092]  Mr. Cilente, it is a complete honor.
[01:13:32.092 --> 01:13:33.673]  I got two questions, actually.
[01:13:35.242 --> 01:13:46.109]  There was a 2005 PNF report by Gary Schmidt that started off saying that Iran's nuclear capability was about 10 years behind.
[01:13:46.109 --> 01:13:56.036]  So my first question is, what do you see in your professional opinion as the reality of their capability?
[01:13:56.036 --> 01:14:02.340]  The other one is, some time ago we had a warhead
[01:14:03.007 --> 01:14:15.657]  That was known as the Whiskey 54, which was, uh, nicknamed a Davy Crockett and a Special Atomics Demolition Munition that was man-portable.
[01:14:15.657 --> 01:14:30.308]  The reason why I'm stating this is this yielded somewhere between 1 and 10 kilotons, so would you say that they would go more, if they played this card, go more route of a kiloton yield, or seeing as how the
[01:14:31.273 --> 01:14:39.636]  Megaton to be too destructive and kind of, I guess, be worthless to what they wanted to end up with.
[01:14:39.636 --> 01:14:40.556]  All right, thank you, Ron.
[01:14:40.556 --> 01:14:43.317]  Let's get Gerald Cilente's take on that question.
[01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:47.458]  We believe that Iran is eventually going to have nuclear weapons.
[01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:50.099]  I guess you could bring it down to the right to bear arms.
[01:14:50.099 --> 01:14:52.239]  They're in a very hostile region.
[01:14:52.239 --> 01:14:54.480]  They have hostile neighbors.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.761]  And it's probably going to be for defensive purposes.
[01:14:58.342 --> 01:15:08.225]  Look, India has them, Pakistan has them, both of them have not signed a nuclear proliferation treaty, as has Israel that hasn't signed it either.
[01:15:08.225 --> 01:15:11.286]  So, we believe at some point they're going to get it.
[01:15:11.286 --> 01:15:18.688]  To use it as a whole other thing, it's like being armed and not going to war for defensive purposes.
[01:15:18.688 --> 01:15:25.790]  And we would say, logically, we believe that Iran is going to move toward nuclear, and there's no stopping them.
[01:15:26.334 --> 01:15:29.596]  And again, under what province do you do that?
[01:15:29.596 --> 01:15:32.358]  When does the hypocrisy stop?
[01:15:32.358 --> 01:15:44.725]  Why can the UK, why can France, why can India, why can China, why can Israel, and why can the United States have nuclear weapons, and Russia, and not Iran?
[01:15:44.725 --> 01:15:45.946]  Well look at North Korea!
[01:15:45.946 --> 01:15:47.727]  As soon as you get a nuke, you get left alone!
[01:15:48.416 --> 01:15:50.960]  Yeah, I mean, you know, are they going to use them?
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.944]  If they use them, they're going to suffer the consequences.
[01:15:53.944 --> 01:15:56.387]  Are they going to use them against Russia and China?
[01:15:56.387 --> 01:15:57.929]  They'll get wiped out like a net!
[01:15:58.479 --> 01:16:05.663]  Even if they used them against Israel, the firepower coming back would be multiples, way beyond.
[01:16:05.663 --> 01:16:09.585]  So, and then again, who in their right mind would use a nuclear weapon?
[01:16:09.585 --> 01:16:11.426]  Well, then they say, oh, they're crazy Muslims.
[01:16:11.426 --> 01:16:15.449]  But, I mean, looking at that, Iran's nuclear program is public.
[01:16:15.449 --> 01:16:18.090]  The centrifuges won't make the uranium they need.
[01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:21.452]  They even offered to have France make it, so everybody knew that it wasn't able to do that.
[01:16:22.112 --> 01:16:25.673]  I mean, Venezuela wants nuclear reactors now.
[01:16:25.673 --> 01:16:27.394]  They are having power outages.
[01:16:27.394 --> 01:16:29.755]  I mean, South Africa's got nukes.
[01:16:29.755 --> 01:16:31.916]  Our government has overthrown Iran twice.
[01:16:31.916 --> 01:16:35.257]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.777]  I know, and that's what we're saying.
[01:16:36.777 --> 01:16:42.879]  But what they're doing is they're using Iran as the symbol for people to hate.
[01:16:42.879 --> 01:16:44.780]  And once you get the people to hate,
[01:16:45.345 --> 01:16:47.947]  Then they can prosecute their war.
[01:16:47.947 --> 01:16:51.069]  And they won't hate the bankers now, that is the real problem.
[01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:55.272]  Of course, the bankers will be forgotten, because that's what we were saying in the beginning.
[01:16:55.272 --> 01:16:59.955]  This is the same scenario, different names, different places.
[01:16:59.955 --> 01:17:00.115]  It's 1929.
[01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:06.659]  It's the Great Depression and it's World War II.
[01:17:06.659 --> 01:17:09.062]  Well, it's the Panic of 08.
[01:17:09.062 --> 01:17:11.024]  We're gonna go into the Great Depression.
[01:17:11.024 --> 01:17:12.305]  We're already in it.
[01:17:12.305 --> 01:17:14.748]  Look how many people have it, don't have jobs.
[01:17:14.748 --> 01:17:15.649]  You know the numbers.
[01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:17.511]  What's the effective unemployment rate?
[01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:17.771]  Around 20%?
[01:17:19.295 --> 01:17:26.637]  You know, so, and now they're going to, the way they're going to get us out of it, when all their other schemes fail, is they're going to take us to war!
[01:17:26.637 --> 01:17:29.639]  They're taking us to war in Pakistan!
[01:17:29.639 --> 01:17:31.739]  Look what's going on over there!
[01:17:31.739 --> 01:17:43.663]  We're in Pakistan, we're in Afghanistan, we're in Iraq, and we're going to go, we're fearful of fighting a war with Iran.
[01:17:43.663 --> 01:17:48.725]  Absolutely, let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Texas, you're on the air, then Pamela, Jim, Paul, and others.
[01:17:49.389 --> 01:17:50.491]  Hi, Gerald.
[01:17:50.491 --> 01:17:51.532]  Hi, Alex.
[01:17:51.532 --> 01:17:52.353]  Hi.
[01:17:52.353 --> 01:17:56.138]  Gerald, I've got two questions for you today.
[01:17:56.138 --> 01:18:05.551]  One to do with the coming war that y'all are predicting, and the other one is trying to forecast exactly when the collapse will happen.
[01:18:06.764 --> 01:18:13.907]  Again, the collapsing timings, it's very difficult for the timing because they come up with schemes on dream dollars.
[01:18:13.907 --> 01:18:16.468]  But you're saying as early as September of this year?
[01:18:16.468 --> 01:18:23.911]  We believe that we could have it by September because, again, who would have thought we would have been bailing out banks and buying up companies?
[01:18:23.911 --> 01:18:28.673]  So it should have gone down and then they do all these things behind the scenes that we don't know about.
[01:18:28.673 --> 01:18:33.755]  But we believe by, and then the other issue, I'm sorry, the other question was?
[01:18:33.755 --> 01:18:34.816]  War.
[01:18:34.816 --> 01:18:35.856]  When do you see that happening?
[01:18:36.906 --> 01:18:45.332]  Again, you know, the timing's very difficult, but we believe it's going to be sooner rather than later, and it's going to be steps into the Great War.
[01:18:45.332 --> 01:18:55.499]  It's not going to be one day, but it can be one day if there is a 9-11 magnitude terror strike, which we believe is going to happen.
[01:18:55.499 --> 01:18:59.042]  So you have all these different factors going on at one time.
[01:18:59.042 --> 01:19:01.344]  Which one's going to be the tripping point?
[01:19:01.344 --> 01:19:03.245]  It's very difficult to say at this point.
[01:19:07.419 --> 01:19:09.499]  Scott, does that answer your question?
[01:19:09.499 --> 01:19:14.180]  I just wanted to ask one quick thing about the war part.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:22.662]  Hugh Court has a website where he calls that Bin Laden has plans for an American Hiroshima.
[01:19:22.662 --> 01:19:32.703]  I wonder if Gerald is familiar with what's available through Dr. Court and if he would have any, you know, does he put much credibility into that?
[01:19:32.703 --> 01:19:35.424]  I've been hearing from Bin Laden now for how many years, you know?
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:42.283]  And I don't think he has the wherewithal, even if he's even there, if there is a Bin Laden anymore.
[01:19:42.283 --> 01:19:43.544]  Scott, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:43.544 --> 01:19:44.605]  Let me comment on that.
[01:19:44.605 --> 01:19:44.825]  Look.
[01:19:45.402 --> 01:19:47.805]  We know Al Qaeda was created by the CIA.
[01:19:47.805 --> 01:19:49.686]  We know bin Laden was CIA.
[01:19:49.686 --> 01:19:58.335]  We know that every week or two there's a new article quoting him from some message board or audio and at the bottom it says we don't know this is him or not.
[01:19:58.335 --> 01:20:01.939]  This is a boogeyman, a Goldstein, somebody to scare the population.
[01:20:01.939 --> 01:20:03.080]  Here's the Washington Times.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:03.921]  Critics.
[01:20:03.921 --> 01:20:07.064]  Obama administration hyping terrorist nuclear risk.
[01:20:07.853 --> 01:20:14.397]  The Obama administration is warning the danger of a terror attack within the United States of the nuclear weapon is increasing.
[01:20:14.397 --> 01:20:21.621]  But US officials say the claim is not based on new intelligence and questioned whether the threat is being overstated.
[01:20:21.621 --> 01:20:23.062]  And President Obama went on in the 47
[01:20:24.042 --> 01:20:35.829]  You know, Nation Nuclear Summit, they were having to conclude that the risk of nuclear confrontation has gone down between nations, but the risk of nuclear attack from terrorists has gone up.
[01:20:35.829 --> 01:20:49.297]  I mean, this, and then it's got all these top analysts saying, this is political hype and fear-mongering, and Obama's trying to blame it on Iran, when Iran is Shiite, the archenemy of the Saudi Arabian Al-Qaeda Wahhabis.
[01:20:49.297 --> 01:20:50.298]  Comments on that, Gerald?
[01:20:51.484 --> 01:20:52.685]  You've covered it.
[01:20:52.685 --> 01:20:55.607]  It is hype, and it could happen, by the way.
[01:20:55.607 --> 01:21:09.898]  You know, when I wrote Trends 2000 back in 1996, we front-loaded it with the breakup of the former Soviet Union and all of the suitcase-sized nukes and other nuclear materials that were being sold on the black market.
[01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:14.442]  So again, with the foreign policy going in the direction it's going in,
[01:21:14.952 --> 01:21:19.094]  Of course there's going to be major reprisals against the United States.
[01:21:19.094 --> 01:21:22.035]  Anybody that thinks differently is out of their mind.
[01:21:22.035 --> 01:21:29.118]  You can't invade other countries, occupy them, kill hundreds of thousands of people, and not want people to get even with you.
[01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:40.022]  How they do it, whether it's nuclear, a biological attack, whether it's a, you know, whatever it might be, in a stadium, in a shopping mall, it's going to happen.
[01:21:40.022 --> 01:21:44.064]  But Gerald, what I'm saying is in this inverted logic,
[01:21:45.831 --> 01:21:47.892]  Terrorism will help the New World Order.
[01:21:47.892 --> 01:21:54.675]  It will help the fascists, the corporatists, because the public doesn't understand we're attacking other people.
[01:21:54.675 --> 01:21:58.197]  You know, if a cop breaks his baton on your head, he charges you.
[01:21:58.197 --> 01:22:00.378]  This literally happens with assaulting him now.
[01:22:00.378 --> 01:22:06.781]  There's a big federal case, of course, with Maryland University over this right now.
[01:22:06.781 --> 01:22:13.904]  And so, it really helps the establishment to stage terror attacks as a pretext to launch these new wars.
[01:22:14.776 --> 01:22:20.239]  Alex, you don't need any clearer proof than Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:26.662]  Iraq is a war being fought under false pretenses.
[01:22:26.662 --> 01:22:29.343]  There was no weapons of mass destruction.
[01:22:29.343 --> 01:22:32.025]  There was no ties to al-Qaeda.
[01:22:32.025 --> 01:22:38.188]  And go back and look at what the reasoning was to attack Afghanistan.
[01:22:38.188 --> 01:22:44.231]  It was to get Osama bin Laden and close down the terrorist camps.
[01:22:44.741 --> 01:22:58.431]  So they're going to use anything they can, fake or real, to keep the military machine going and to keep the people under their thumb in the height of fear.
[01:22:58.431 --> 01:23:11.500]  And as you mentioned, they're using the fear card again and they're playing the card as a trial balloon because there's going to be real reasons for fear coming down the road.
[01:23:12.273 --> 01:23:15.942]  Okay, I want to go back to calls, but I wanted to bring up another subject.
[01:23:15.942 --> 01:23:20.975]  Back in January of last year, a year and a half ago, or almost a year and a half ago, we got
[01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:26.551]  State of New York, Bureau of Cemeteries, internal documents.
[01:23:26.551 --> 01:23:36.633]  We had emergency managers on, saying they're preparing in Indiana and Illinois for millions of dead, that the flu was coming, it was going to kill millions, and that the feds had to take over and have martial law.
[01:23:36.633 --> 01:23:37.973]  We got the documents.
[01:23:37.973 --> 01:23:38.773]  I warned the people.
[01:23:38.773 --> 01:23:44.954]  Then in April, out of the wrong season, wrong hemisphere, H1N1 pops up.
[01:23:44.954 --> 01:23:47.815]  I go on air and I say, I don't know if this is going to be real or not,
[01:23:48.999 --> 01:23:55.265]  Whether it's real flu or not, it's psychological terrorism, just like if it's a real nuke attack or not, it's psychological terrorism.
[01:23:55.265 --> 01:24:08.958]  Then, the head of the EU Health Commission, 47-member group, Wolfgang Wudrig, we had him on, documented that they paid off the scientists in our governments, had them lie to make tens of billions on sales.
[01:24:08.958 --> 01:24:13.162]  You talked about it being a fraud, I talked about it, here it is, the Daily Mail,
[01:24:14.039 --> 01:24:17.023]  We blundered over swine flu health chiefs.
[01:24:17.023 --> 01:24:23.791]  Global health chiefs have finally admitted that they may have overreacted to swine flu pandemic, landing governments with millions of unused vaccines.
[01:24:23.791 --> 01:24:24.953]  That's the whitewash.
[01:24:24.953 --> 01:24:31.561]  But there we are again, right about the fact that H1N1 was a hoax, but that it was genetically engineered.
[01:24:31.561 --> 01:24:32.462]  That's been confirmed.
[01:24:33.082 --> 01:24:39.846]  And that if you took the seasonal flu shot, that's what gave you the H1N1, they were putting it in the vaccines.
[01:24:39.846 --> 01:24:46.390]  That's in five new studies that they were actually... I mean, this is so diabolical, it's right out in the open and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:24:47.230 --> 01:24:50.252]  Well, look what's going on with the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:24:50.252 --> 01:25:01.582]  They hire doctors, and they pay the doctors to do the research, and then the doctors become spokespersons for the pharmaceutical industry, and they make up fake studies.
[01:25:01.582 --> 01:25:03.203]  I mean, how much more proof do you need?
[01:25:03.203 --> 01:25:08.948]  Hey, ladies, remember all of that estrogen they told you to take for how many years?
[01:25:09.708 --> 01:25:20.372]  And then the people that were saying that it was dangerous for you, and it wasn't doing the things that they claimed it was doing, they would, they would, you know, run them into the ground.
[01:25:20.372 --> 01:25:24.433]  So yeah, it's every level, and again, keep making the connections.
[01:25:24.994 --> 01:25:26.594]  You know, it's the same thing.
[01:25:26.594 --> 01:25:34.357]  It's the pharmaceutical companies, it's big agriculture, it's big banks, and it's the Great War.
[01:25:34.357 --> 01:25:35.777]  It all adds up.
[01:25:35.777 --> 01:25:38.558]  It all goes into the same direction.
[01:25:38.558 --> 01:25:42.459]  World War II, World War I, and the war coming up.
[01:25:42.899 --> 01:25:44.921]  It's a war of profits.
[01:25:44.921 --> 01:25:47.824]  They'll kill anybody, they'll do anything.
[01:25:47.824 --> 01:25:51.869]  As I said before, they're nothing more than money junkies.
[01:25:59.749 --> 01:26:02.011]  That's a Twitter question.
[01:26:02.011 --> 01:26:03.592]  States moving to sue.
[01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.153]  States talking about secession.
[01:26:05.153 --> 01:26:08.635]  Even Rick Perry talking about it, declaring 10th Amendment.
[01:26:08.635 --> 01:26:10.156]  Where do you see that going?
[01:26:10.156 --> 01:26:10.836]  Oh, definitely.
[01:26:10.836 --> 01:26:12.637]  We wrote about this years ago.
[01:26:12.637 --> 01:26:14.839]  Secessionism is a real movement.
[01:26:14.839 --> 01:26:19.642]  We could see the United States breaking up like the former Soviet Union.
[01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:21.223]  The second Vermont Republic.
[01:26:21.583 --> 01:26:22.503]  Check that one out.
[01:26:22.503 --> 01:26:22.963]  They're real.
[01:26:22.963 --> 01:26:24.324]  This is for real.
[01:26:24.324 --> 01:26:26.104]  And these are really intelligent guys.
[01:26:26.104 --> 01:26:27.364]  Thomas Naylor.
[01:26:27.364 --> 01:26:30.625]  I mean, this guy's, you know, Professor Emeritus from Duke University.
[01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:32.585]  There are a lot of intelligent people.
[01:26:32.585 --> 01:26:34.525]  We can see it breaking up.
[01:26:34.525 --> 01:26:37.606]  As the government grips more, the states break apart.
[01:26:37.606 --> 01:26:42.047]  Here's another question, Twitter question, from Fedros.
[01:26:42.047 --> 01:26:45.727]  It says, the Australian economy seems to follow the U.S.
[01:26:45.727 --> 01:26:46.367]  closely.
[01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:46.887]  Should the U.S.
[01:26:46.887 --> 01:26:50.368]  economy implode, what chance have we here in Oz?
[01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:57.674]  They won't get hit as bad, but there will be very few countries that escape it.
[01:26:57.674 --> 01:27:05.497]  The best countries that we're looking at, and they're in this Trends Journal, is Australia, Canada, Norway, New Zealand.
[01:27:05.497 --> 01:27:06.417]  Those are about the top.
[01:27:06.417 --> 01:27:07.838]  And of course, Switzerland.
[01:27:07.838 --> 01:27:10.179]  They're the money cockroaches of the world.
[01:27:10.179 --> 01:27:11.639]  They never go anywhere.
[01:27:11.639 --> 01:27:17.061]  But they won't get hit as bad as the United States, because they're not as indebted as we are.
[01:27:17.813 --> 01:27:24.881]  What do you think about state bank initiatives where we have state banks that give the public free credit?
[01:27:24.881 --> 01:27:27.364]  I don't think they give free credit at all.
[01:27:27.364 --> 01:27:31.790]  But what we should go back to, we believe, is the Glass-Steagall Act.
[01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:34.653]  It worked before, it saved us after the Great Depression.
[01:27:34.977 --> 01:27:37.738]  So the criminals couldn't do what they're doing now.
[01:27:37.738 --> 01:27:47.123]  And by the way, the things that I do personally, I put all my money, most of our money in the community bank, in the local bank.
[01:27:47.123 --> 01:27:48.564]  I know it's sound.
[01:27:48.564 --> 01:27:54.427]  And I also, of course, because we're an international business, we have to have international banks.
[01:27:54.427 --> 01:27:55.927]  But they can't loan for free.
[01:27:55.927 --> 01:27:59.109]  I mean, it can't work like that.
[01:28:01.184 --> 01:28:05.105]  What do you see with the population and the relationship with police?
[01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:23.111]  Now because of all these tiny handheld cameras built into cell phones, iPads, you name it, iPhones, we're really seeing police walk up, beat innocent people half to death, throw legless men out of wheelchairs, going crazy and being encouraged to do it, and now the public's really getting to see this.
[01:28:23.111 --> 01:28:27.192]  Where do you see that going and where do you see the attempt to clamp down on free speech on the internet going?
[01:28:28.566 --> 01:28:32.447]  Well, they are clamping down on free speech.
[01:28:32.447 --> 01:28:34.488]  They're going to continue to clamp down.
[01:28:34.488 --> 01:28:48.712]  We just saw that federal court ruling that was in favor of a Comcast, where they can now charge different prices for different clients to give them different speeds.
[01:28:48.712 --> 01:28:50.773]  That may come about in the future.
[01:28:50.773 --> 01:28:54.114]  So net neutrality is really under attack.
[01:28:54.114 --> 01:28:57.195]  As far as the police, the police are becoming like goon squads.
[01:28:57.777 --> 01:29:04.940]  Well, that's what happens when a nation goes from first class to third world.
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.382]  They beat you into submission.
[01:29:07.382 --> 01:29:11.884]  And that's what's going on in the United States more and more.
[01:29:11.884 --> 01:29:13.965]  Let's jam in a phone call here.
[01:29:13.965 --> 01:29:18.407]  Up next is Pamela in Wisconsin and Jim, Paul and Chuck will at least get to those.
[01:29:18.407 --> 01:29:19.127]  Jim, go ahead.
[01:29:19.127 --> 01:29:24.530]  Hey, Jim, we're on the air.
[01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:25.090]  How you doing, buddy?
[01:29:26.053 --> 01:29:28.154]  I go to Paul in Tennessee.
[01:29:28.154 --> 01:29:28.794]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:29:28.794 --> 01:29:30.994]  You're on the air.
[01:29:30.994 --> 01:29:32.015]  Hey, are you there?
[01:29:32.015 --> 01:29:32.415]  Yes, sir.
[01:29:32.415 --> 01:29:32.795]  Go ahead.
[01:29:32.795 --> 01:29:34.535]  All right.
[01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:40.357]  I hear you people talking all the time about God, gold, and guns.
[01:29:40.357 --> 01:29:41.277]  My question is this.
[01:29:41.277 --> 01:29:53.480]  Now, the thing is, okay, buying gold would be a wise investment, but my question is, if these people have this gold, and the dollar is only worth, as far as I know, maybe four cents, why would they sell their gold
[01:29:54.463 --> 01:29:55.704]  Or a dollar.
[01:29:55.704 --> 01:29:57.345]  No, no, no, no, you won't.
[01:29:57.345 --> 01:29:59.067]  There'll be inflation of the dollar.
[01:29:59.067 --> 01:30:02.469]  So instead of getting $1,000 an ounce, you might get $3,000 an ounce.
[01:30:02.469 --> 01:30:08.493]  So your gold, when you sell it, would convert to whatever the currency was at that time, thus protecting you from inflation.
[01:30:08.493 --> 01:30:09.654]  Gerald Solenti.
[01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:10.115]  You said it.
[01:30:10.115 --> 01:30:10.455]  That's it.
[01:30:10.455 --> 01:30:11.095]  That's it.
[01:30:11.095 --> 01:30:17.500]  And by the way, my strategy is personally, I'm heavily invested in gold and have been for years.
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:20.803]  I also buy Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and U.S.
[01:30:20.803 --> 01:30:21.183]  dollars.
[01:30:21.570 --> 01:30:32.278]  Because in that play, all I want to do is to stay even, and gold is my wild card, because I believe that they're going to devalue the dollar rather than it inflating.
[01:30:32.278 --> 01:30:36.001]  One way or another, it's not going to be worth, it won't be able to buy a candy bar.
[01:30:36.001 --> 01:30:40.505]  And gold is up almost 400% in the last 10 years, so that was a good bet for you.
[01:30:40.505 --> 01:30:44.828]  Well, yeah, and we believe it's going to hit $2,000 and beyond.
[01:30:44.828 --> 01:30:49.252]  Cindy, Chuck, and Eric, you are straight ahead, final caller for Gerald Cilente.
[01:30:51.178 --> 01:30:54.299]  And we'll give you his website as well on the other side.

[01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:50.978]  MaxFitGloves.
[01:31:50.978 --> 01:31:52.561]  Incredible grip in any conditions.
[01:32:01.736 --> 01:32:04.037]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:32:04.037 --> 01:32:06.437]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:32:06.437 --> 01:32:09.658]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:32:09.658 --> 01:32:14.760]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.941]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:32:19.261 --> 01:32:21.725]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:32:21.725 --> 01:32:24.509]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:32:24.509 --> 01:32:27.413]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:32:27.413 --> 01:32:35.025]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:32:35.345 --> 01:32:40.749]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:32:40.749 --> 01:32:43.591]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:47.294]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:32:47.294 --> 01:32:48.375]  And I got news for you.
[01:32:48.375 --> 01:32:49.696]  You're everyone else.
[01:32:49.696 --> 01:32:51.197]  Invisible Empire.

[01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:09.242]  I think so.
[01:33:33.612 --> 01:33:34.052]  We're good to go.
[01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:10.858]  Final segment, then we go into retransmission, jam-packed economic news.
[01:34:10.858 --> 01:34:12.299]  It was in the first hour.

[01:34:27.733 --> 01:34:31.016]  It has to do with this iPad you see right here.
[01:34:31.016 --> 01:34:32.317]  Something that's gonna be happening
[01:34:33.087 --> 01:34:38.850]  With this, tomorrow on the show, you do not want to miss it.
[01:34:38.850 --> 01:34:41.611]  Jamming in three final calls for Gerald Solenta.
[01:34:41.611 --> 01:34:45.953]  We really appreciate the Top Trends Forecaster spending almost two hours with us today.
[01:34:45.953 --> 01:34:47.974]  Chuck in Vegas, you're on the air.
[01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:48.434]  Go ahead.
[01:34:48.434 --> 01:34:50.916]  Hi Alex, nice to speak to you.
[01:34:50.916 --> 01:34:56.598]  I wanted to quickly just say, I've been listening to your show for a little more than a year now.
[01:34:56.598 --> 01:34:59.480]  It was a breath of fresh air to be able to
[01:35:00.342 --> 01:35:02.623]  Get the information that you have.
[01:35:02.623 --> 01:35:11.787]  It's something that I've been inquisitive about for years, and you were speaking vaguely about the recent
[01:35:14.358 --> 01:35:19.723]  They use the environment, they use bugs, they use war all as a pretext to take control of our lives.
[01:35:35.078 --> 01:35:40.887]  Now, my Facebook page is nothing, no BS, it's nothing but informative information.
[01:35:40.887 --> 01:35:45.715]  I either get linked from you or other, the Drudge Report, other... Sure, we're almost out of time, go ahead.
[01:35:46.826 --> 01:35:49.667]  My thing is, what do we do to wake people up?
[01:35:49.667 --> 01:36:04.771]  Like, even in my own household, I speak to my wife about this stuff, and I can engage her shortly, but her standards, I mean, she's more concerned about Jesse James and that whole... Well, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, there's some people, love them to death, aren't ever concerned.
[01:36:04.771 --> 01:36:06.071]  It's like in the Godfather, they say,
[01:36:06.551 --> 01:36:10.733]  You know, women and children can be careless, men cannot be careless.
[01:36:10.733 --> 01:36:13.534]  And a lot of men act like women, and a lot of women act like men.
[01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:15.675]  But let's talk to Gerald Cilente about that.
[01:36:15.675 --> 01:36:18.377]  I would move on to people that do want to be warned.
[01:36:18.377 --> 01:36:20.638]  5% started this country.
[01:36:20.638 --> 01:36:21.758]  Gerald Cilente.
[01:36:21.758 --> 01:36:22.298]  That's it.
[01:36:22.298 --> 01:36:24.820]  It's about 20% could change the whole country.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.041]  We believe there's 20% that'll move.
[01:36:27.041 --> 01:36:30.002]  There's a great quote attributed to Jesus Christ.
[01:36:30.737 --> 01:36:42.267]  I can heal the sick, I can make the blind see the lame walk, I can even raise the dead, but I, not even I, can save a fool from their foolishness.
[01:36:42.267 --> 01:36:44.009]  Absolutely, so just move on Chuck.
[01:36:44.009 --> 01:36:45.410]  I mean, try to educate your wife.
[01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:48.673]  As things get worse, she'll listen to you later.
[01:36:48.673 --> 01:36:50.255]  Eric in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:36:50.255 --> 01:36:51.576]  Quick question for Gerald.
[01:36:51.576 --> 01:36:52.397]  Yeah, thanks a lot.
[01:36:52.397 --> 01:36:57.141]  Listen, real quick, is the central point behind all these scams and frauds and
[01:36:57.719 --> 01:37:00.021]  And Trix is the complicit media.
[01:37:00.021 --> 01:37:02.584]  Why aren't they the central target of our effort?
[01:37:02.584 --> 01:37:06.187]  Because without the corrupt media, so many people wouldn't be fooled.
[01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:11.392]  Well, the media is all losing their viewers and falling apart, so they want to shut down our free space, which was a kick in their butt.
[01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:12.333]  Gerald?
[01:37:12.333 --> 01:37:12.854]  That's it.
[01:37:12.854 --> 01:37:16.877]  The biggest trend that we're writing about is going to be Internet TV.
[01:37:16.877 --> 01:37:19.340]  Everything you see on that little screen
[01:37:19.815 --> 01:37:28.020]  Now goes to the big screen and they're really fearful of that because they can't keep up and compare with the content coming from an Alex Jones.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:30.621]  You're not going to see that on CNN.
[01:37:30.621 --> 01:37:35.184]  So that's the real fear and that's why they're going to clamp down on the media in the future.
[01:37:35.184 --> 01:37:36.325]  Well, here's an example.
[01:37:36.325 --> 01:37:41.348]  I mean, Gerald Salente's on Fox, CNN, you name it, but here you get to hear in-depth two hours.
[01:37:41.348 --> 01:37:45.830]  I mean, and here he can really, you know, break things down in detail.
[01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:46.391]  Thank you, Eric.
[01:37:46.391 --> 01:37:48.532]  Real quick, Brad in California, go ahead.
[01:37:50.785 --> 01:37:52.907]  I've got some property in Argentina.
[01:37:52.907 --> 01:37:56.990]  Actually, I was wondering if you think that's a good safe country to be in when all this stuff goes down.
[01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.891]  Absolutely not!
[01:37:57.891 --> 01:37:59.212]  We'll get Gerald's opinion.
[01:37:59.212 --> 01:38:00.093]  Run by the bankers.
[01:38:00.093 --> 01:38:01.835]  They're grabbing your pension funds right now.
[01:38:01.835 --> 01:38:02.575]  Gerald?
[01:38:02.575 --> 01:38:04.417]  I just got back from Argentina.
[01:38:04.417 --> 01:38:05.898]  Coming in from Chile.
[01:38:05.898 --> 01:38:07.740]  I don't know if you know I was there during the earthquake in Chile.
[01:38:08.755 --> 01:38:20.979]  And, uh, you know, when we came over, all of a sudden, a couple of times, they had these roadblocks with helicopters and guys dressed with enough body armor to go to the Battle of the Bulge.
[01:38:20.979 --> 01:38:22.899]  No, it's a place that's on the edge.
[01:38:22.899 --> 01:38:25.140]  But I would say also that
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.321]  You know, I wouldn't buy anything anywhere.
[01:38:28.321 --> 01:38:33.183]  I would just go someplace and check it out, stay there a while.
[01:38:33.183 --> 01:38:35.003]  You don't have to buy anything.
[01:38:35.003 --> 01:38:36.264]  Gerald, we're out of time.
[01:38:36.264 --> 01:38:37.084]  We're out of time.
[01:38:37.084 --> 01:38:38.304]  Great job.
[01:38:38.304 --> 01:38:38.984]  God bless you.
[01:38:38.984 --> 01:38:40.025]  Thank you.
[01:38:40.025 --> 01:38:41.025]  Thank you.
[01:38:41.025 --> 01:38:44.486]  We'll be right back.
[01:38:44.486 --> 01:38:46.967]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:38:46.967 --> 01:38:49.268]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:38:51.741 --> 01:38:54.063]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:38:54.063 --> 01:38:56.326]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:38:56.326 --> 01:38:59.649]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:38:59.649 --> 01:39:04.754]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:39:04.754 --> 01:39:08.958]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:39:09.258 --> 01:39:11.622]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:39:11.622 --> 01:39:14.506]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:39:14.506 --> 01:39:17.410]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:25.022]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:39:25.342 --> 01:39:30.745]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:39:30.745 --> 01:39:33.587]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:39:33.587 --> 01:39:37.289]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:39:37.289 --> 01:39:38.190]  And I got news for you.
[01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:39.691]  You're everyone else.
[01:39:39.691 --> 01:39:41.192]  Invisible Empire.

[01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:57.357]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:39:57.357 --> 01:40:06.704]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:40:06.704 --> 01:40:08.005]  Big Brother.
[01:40:08.005 --> 01:40:09.767]  Mainstream media.
[01:40:09.767 --> 01:40:11.528]  Government cover-ups.
[01:40:11.528 --> 01:40:13.109]  You want answers?
[01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:15.051]  Well, so does he.
[01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:18.854]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:40:18.854 --> 01:40:22.917]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:40:24.278 --> 01:40:34.622]  Coming up in the next hour, Lord Christopher Monckton, one of the key Tea Party speakers in Washington, will be joining us on government-run healthcare in England, on all the latest on Climategate.
[01:40:34.622 --> 01:40:37.943]  Devastating news has broken this week of the systematic fraud.
[01:40:37.943 --> 01:40:39.283]  That's coming up.
[01:40:39.283 --> 01:40:45.746]  We're going to premiere my newest documentary that I've produced, that Jason Burma's directed, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, at 3 p.m.
[01:40:47.299 --> 01:40:48.980]  Central today when the show ends.
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:55.823]  We have something special we're going to do that you're going to be amazed by coming up in the last hour as well.
[01:40:55.823 --> 01:40:59.164]  He announced two and a half weeks ago that he's retiring from his twice-a-week column.
[01:40:59.164 --> 01:41:09.349]  He's a former Wall Street Journal editor, the father of Reaganomics, the head of policy department of Treasury, and of course his new book is How the Economy Was Lost, The War of the Worlds, Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:41:09.349 --> 01:41:14.831]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is with us and before he sails off into the sunset, at least for a while, taking a break,
[01:41:15.511 --> 01:41:16.912]  He's agreed to do a couple interviews with us.
[01:41:16.912 --> 01:41:39.481]  He did one last week, and now he's back on tax day this week to talk about the economy, the value-added taxes, all the things, the carbon taxes they're calling for, and what he talked about last week, the systematic destruction by design of our economy, the total conversion to basically Mexico or another third world nation where you have a tiny elite and a giant underclass.
[01:41:39.481 --> 01:41:42.382]  Dr. Roberts, great to have you here with us today, sir.
[01:41:42.382 --> 01:41:43.403]  Pleased to be with you, Alex.
[01:41:44.266 --> 01:41:46.747]  You look good there with your Skype connection.
[01:41:46.747 --> 01:41:50.908]  I see you've got Napoleon Bonaparte on the wall behind you.
[01:41:50.908 --> 01:41:59.590]  Yes, somebody gave me that some years ago when the President of France gave me the French Legion of Honour.
[01:41:59.590 --> 01:42:01.750]  I can't remember who it was.
[01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:06.731]  Somebody gave me this very romantic picture of a copy.
[01:42:06.731 --> 01:42:13.633]  This is a copy of the romantic portrayal of Napoleon that's in the Louvre in Paris.
[01:42:14.716 --> 01:42:15.196]  Wow.
[01:42:15.196 --> 01:42:20.479]  Yeah, you never brag about all the laurels you've got in one of the top ten economists living on the planet.
[01:42:20.479 --> 01:42:21.099]  You know the drill.
[01:42:21.099 --> 01:42:24.681]  We're going to break in about three minutes, but you wanted to come on on Tax Day.
[01:42:24.681 --> 01:42:25.722]  We're honored to have you here.
[01:42:25.722 --> 01:42:26.942]  We won't be censored.
[01:42:26.942 --> 01:42:28.903]  Break it down for us.
[01:42:28.903 --> 01:42:34.967]  Well, you know, Alex, one of the great myths is that Americans are free people.
[01:42:34.967 --> 01:42:39.809]  And once upon a time they were, but they've not been free since 1913.
[01:42:39.809 --> 01:42:43.171]  Because once you have an income tax, you no longer
[01:42:43.761 --> 01:42:46.102]  Own your own labor.
[01:42:46.102 --> 01:42:54.685]  And the historic definition of a free person is a person who owns his own labor.
[01:42:54.685 --> 01:43:01.228]  If you don't own your own labor, you are a serf or a slave.
[01:43:01.228 --> 01:43:07.890]  So all Americans are either serfs or slaves, depending on the bracket.
[01:43:07.890 --> 01:43:12.672]  There are no free Americans and have not been any free Americans
[01:43:13.314 --> 01:43:15.656]  Since 1913.
[01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:26.483]  So when you hear our leaders such as George W. Bush talk about we have freedom in democracy, you certainly don't have freedom.
[01:43:26.483 --> 01:43:28.364]  You're a serf.
[01:43:28.364 --> 01:43:38.391]  All serfs were required to turn over 20-30% of their labor time to the government of their day.
[01:43:38.391 --> 01:43:42.554]  A slave has to turn over about half of his labor time
[01:43:43.018 --> 01:43:45.359]  To his honor.
[01:43:45.359 --> 01:43:51.281]  And Americans fall in between those two ranges.
[01:43:51.281 --> 01:44:02.945]  So every American who works and earns an income is either serf or slave or in between that margin.
[01:44:02.945 --> 01:44:11.849]  And that is simply the historic definition of a free person agreed to by the liberals, by Karl Marx
[01:44:12.861 --> 01:44:20.206]  By the conservatives, by all historians, that is the definition of a free person.
[01:44:20.206 --> 01:44:23.149]  We don't meet that definition.
[01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:25.891]  And people should be aware of this.
[01:44:25.891 --> 01:44:28.493]  And that's the real message of April 15.
[01:44:28.493 --> 01:44:35.518]  It reminds you every year that you're not a free man or woman.
[01:44:35.518 --> 01:44:41.202]  You are a serf of the government who has a claim to
[01:44:43.061 --> 01:44:43.501]  What?
[01:44:43.501 --> 01:44:45.262]  One-third of your income?
[01:44:45.262 --> 01:44:45.762]  Or more.
[01:44:45.762 --> 01:44:47.823]  Stay there, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:44:47.823 --> 01:44:55.547]  We'll look at the history of the income tax, how it's been accelerating and expanding, and a lot more, and how we try to shake off this bondage.
[01:44:55.547 --> 01:44:56.387]  And your phone calls.
[01:44:56.387 --> 01:44:58.728]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts with us in the next hour.
[01:44:58.728 --> 01:44:59.689]  We're very honored to have him.
[01:45:01.786 --> 01:45:03.086]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:45:03.086 --> 01:45:08.688]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:45:08.688 --> 01:45:13.710]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:45:13.710 --> 01:45:18.732]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:45:19.272 --> 01:45:24.496]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:45:24.496 --> 01:45:26.817]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:45:26.817 --> 01:45:31.620]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:32.741]  And here's the best part.
[01:45:32.741 --> 01:45:35.803]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:45:35.803 --> 01:45:39.426]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:45:39.426 --> 01:45:42.608]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:45:42.608 --> 01:45:44.829]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:45:44.829 --> 01:45:45.770]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:45:49.392 --> 01:45:50.833]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:45:50.833 --> 01:45:58.460]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:01.643]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:46:01.643 --> 01:46:06.948]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:46:06.948 --> 01:46:09.710]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:46:09.710 --> 01:46:14.174]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:46:15.031 --> 01:46:19.493]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[01:47:06.511 --> 01:47:08.673]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[01:47:08.673 --> 01:47:09.554]  Okay.

[01:47:19.585 --> 01:47:20.426]  Wow!

[01:48:04.881 --> 01:48:11.505]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:48:11.505 --> 01:48:16.828]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:16.828 --> 01:48:23.072]  Many times when Congressman Ron Paul is on Fox or CNN or MSNBC, they'll say, you're against the government.
[01:48:23.072 --> 01:48:24.013]  You hate the government.
[01:48:25.003 --> 01:48:26.784]  How are we supposed to fund our country?
[01:48:26.784 --> 01:48:32.966]  And many times he's standing in the Capitol or the Capitals behind him and he says, well, we built this Capitol.
[01:48:32.966 --> 01:48:38.048]  Our country had a 10% growth rate on average until 1913 when we got the income tax.
[01:48:38.048 --> 01:48:40.248]  That you will notice is in the Communist Manifesto.
[01:48:40.248 --> 01:48:42.469]  So is a private central bank.
[01:48:42.469 --> 01:48:44.470]  And we have been turned into serfs.
[01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:47.491]  Not just with the income tax, but property tax is a rent.
[01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:50.712]  Serfs paid a property tax as well.
[01:48:51.432 --> 01:48:55.614]  And since 1913 it just expands and expands and expands and expands.
[01:48:55.614 --> 01:49:01.617]  Now the bankers, Volcker and others, want a value-added tax, sales taxes, carbon taxes.
[01:49:01.617 --> 01:49:03.057]  It's all being announced.
[01:49:03.057 --> 01:49:06.839]  Former Wall Street Journal editor, for those that just joined us, father of Reaganomics,
[01:49:07.439 --> 01:49:07.720]  Oh, Alex.
[01:49:28.635 --> 01:49:29.736]  Phone has started ringing.
[01:49:29.736 --> 01:49:31.157]  Can I get up and turn it off?
[01:49:31.157 --> 01:49:31.457]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:31.457 --> 01:49:31.917]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:49:31.917 --> 01:49:34.939]  You gotta love live TV here in radio.
[01:49:34.939 --> 01:49:38.181]  And for those that just joined us, we are live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:38.181 --> 01:49:43.644]  You can see all the great awards Dr. Roberts has in the back, including the Legion of Merit from France.
[01:49:43.644 --> 01:49:44.705]  That's their highest award.
[01:49:44.705 --> 01:49:46.466]  He is something else.
[01:49:46.466 --> 01:49:48.487]  Never even knew he had that.
[01:49:48.487 --> 01:49:51.189]  But gotta love live TV.
[01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:57.953]  Okay, Dr. Roberts, continuing, recapping our journey to serfdom, and now it's only accelerating deeper into bondage.
[01:49:58.834 --> 01:50:14.080]  Well, you know, the main point, Alex, was that a free person owns his own labor, and an income tax means the government has the first claim on your labor, just like feudal lords did, or a slave master.
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.341]  And so Americans are not free, and haven't been for almost a century now.
[01:50:18.341 --> 01:50:26.004]  We're three years short of a century of living as serfs, while the government tells us that we have freedom.
[01:50:28.385 --> 01:50:51.276]  You know that under the Constitution the income tax is unconstitutional and certainly nobody in the latter part of the 18th century was going to propose an income tax since it was so close to the time that serfs were becoming free labor as opposed to serfs and so the notion of
[01:50:52.496 --> 01:51:01.018]  Having the government have a claim on your labor would have been seen as a step back into the Dark Ages or into the Medieval Period.
[01:51:01.018 --> 01:51:03.958]  And so, how did we get the income tax?
[01:51:03.958 --> 01:51:08.479]  Well, the Democrats wanted it to get the rich.
[01:51:08.479 --> 01:51:14.641]  And they got one passed and it was ruled unconstitutional and they had to have a constitutional amendment.
[01:51:14.641 --> 01:51:21.862]  And the way they got it, if my memory serves, the Republicans wanted a higher tariff.
[01:51:23.777 --> 01:51:26.158]  to protect the industries.
[01:51:26.158 --> 01:51:30.540]  During our great growth period, we had high tariffs.
[01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:35.243]  We did not develop on the basis of free trade.
[01:51:35.243 --> 01:51:48.389]  So, in order to get the tariff, the Democrats said, look, tariffs are like sales taxes, and they're regressive, and people have to pay it who don't have a lot of money.
[01:51:48.389 --> 01:51:48.649]  And so,
[01:51:51.036 --> 01:52:02.979]  If you will go along with letting us have a go at a constitutional amendment on the income tax, we'll let you have your tariff.
[01:52:02.979 --> 01:52:12.202]  And the Republicans all said, well, you know, the states will never pass this, so let's make the deal so we can get a higher tariff.
[01:52:12.202 --> 01:52:16.063]  So they made the deal, and when it went out to the states,
[01:52:19.093 --> 01:52:29.618]  The states looked at it and said, well look, look how much money you have to have before you even hit a 1% income tax rate.
[01:52:29.618 --> 01:52:32.519]  Nobody in our state has that much money.
[01:52:32.519 --> 01:52:37.341]  We don't care if this passes, it doesn't affect us.
[01:52:37.341 --> 01:52:47.266]  And so, it passed because the majority of the states came to the conclusion that nobody in the state had an income that large.
[01:52:47.266 --> 01:52:47.966]  But of course,
[01:52:48.963 --> 01:52:53.625]  As soon as it's in, World War I starts.
[01:52:53.625 --> 01:52:56.526]  And, of course, they want to finance the war.
[01:52:56.526 --> 01:53:12.771]  And so, all of a sudden, the thresholds at which the tax comes in are lowered, the rates at which are charged are raised, and the whole population is almost subject to the income tax, which was only going to be for the rich.
[01:53:12.771 --> 01:53:15.032]  Well, that's how it happened.
[01:53:15.032 --> 01:53:18.113]  That's how it came into effect.
[01:53:18.826 --> 01:53:33.473]  It was a miscalculation as a part of a deal to be able to raise a tariff in exchange for giving the Democrats a go at a constitutional amendment.
[01:53:33.979 --> 01:53:37.921]  To make income tax permissible.
[01:53:37.921 --> 01:53:40.962]  Well, Dr. Roberts, let me add a caveat before you continue.
[01:53:40.962 --> 01:53:50.767]  We notice in the same year, 1913, we get the income tax to now fund the new central bank that so many of our forefathers had fought against.
[01:53:50.767 --> 01:54:00.172]  As Thomas Jefferson said, if you allow private corporations and banks to issue currency and credit, you will wake up homeless on the continent your forefathers conquered.
[01:54:00.872 --> 01:54:14.342]  And we also, that same year, got the 17th Amendment, taking the senators from the states, voted on by the legislatures, and making them federal creatures, so further dominating the states.
[01:54:14.342 --> 01:54:25.070]  And so the central banks that helped, and private banks that helped ram this through, did it in the name of getting the rich guys, the robber barons, but really the robber barons that helped them vertically integrate
[01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:30.591]  That's true, and that's one of the subjects of my recent book, How the Economy Was Lost.
[01:54:30.591 --> 01:54:33.912]  You gave a very good summary of what happened.
[01:54:33.912 --> 01:54:34.872]  All of it in the name of reform.
[01:54:34.872 --> 01:54:38.913]  And of course, the reforms destroyed the federal structure.
[01:54:55.771 --> 01:54:59.274]  and gave us the powerful central government.
[01:54:59.274 --> 01:55:07.743]  The Civil War did a great job in destroying states' rights, but certain amounts of it remained until 1913.
[01:55:19.778 --> 01:55:24.282]  I want to talk more about the income tax and all the new taxes they want to pile on that are similar.
[01:55:24.282 --> 01:55:26.304]  But what about the states and property taxes?
[01:55:26.304 --> 01:55:31.049]  Many states didn't have property taxes until the last 20, 30 years and they go up and up and up.
[01:55:31.049 --> 01:55:42.620]  That's another classic feudal serf tax where you didn't own the land you were on, you were the keeper of it, but you had to pay a percentage to the nobles.
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.702]  Yes, of course.
[01:55:46.964 --> 01:55:56.792]  Property taxes really aren't abortable because even if you rent from a landlord he has to pay the tax so it goes in to the rent.
[01:55:56.792 --> 01:56:06.699]  Property tax, the reason given for that and what was used was to fund public schools.
[01:56:06.699 --> 01:56:16.106]  So you find the public school system based on the property tax and therefore this made it
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:46.492]  Free, so to speak, since property tax wasn't avoidable, and people paid the property tax, so they used public schools, and this was a great setback to private education, and it was another mechanism for government to condition the thinking of people, to brainwash them through time, to make them think that they are free.
[01:56:47.918 --> 01:56:54.120]  and have democracy, even though they are at the service of the government.
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:59.262]  The government has a very powerful claim on their income.
[01:56:59.262 --> 01:57:01.883]  Let me illustrate that a little bit more.
[01:57:01.883 --> 01:57:11.767]  Back during the slavery period in the United States, there were slaves who had special skills.
[01:57:11.767 --> 01:57:13.288]  They were craftsmen.
[01:57:13.288 --> 01:57:16.769]  They were highly trained in some aspect of
[01:57:18.015 --> 01:57:42.641]  of arts and crafts and they were their labor was worth more than working in the cotton fields or working on the plantation and so what would happen is the owners of the slave would lease the slave to a businessman in a city or town and the man who leased the slave
[01:57:43.345 --> 01:58:00.758]  Would withhold half of the slave's earnings and send it back to the owner and give the other half to the slave which he used to maintain himself in town where he lived, you know, on his own resources after tax.
[01:58:00.758 --> 01:58:04.141]  Well, that's the way it works today.
[01:58:04.141 --> 01:58:07.864]  Most people cannot avoid income tax because they never get the money.
[01:58:07.864 --> 01:58:09.105]  It's withheld at the source.
[01:58:09.784 --> 01:58:20.628]  And by the way, we've seen this new hoax by AP and others, I see it all over the news, that 47% of Americans don't pay income tax after deductions, but what is FICA and Social Security?
[01:58:20.628 --> 01:58:28.331]  Don't they know that their employers are just paying them less because they have to pay all those other taxes and matching Social Security, FICA?
[01:58:28.331 --> 01:58:34.073]  I mean, this lie that 47% of the public are avoiding taxes is a hoax, is it not?
[01:58:34.073 --> 01:58:34.893]  Yes, it's a hoax.
[01:58:35.842 --> 01:58:38.943]  Most of the things they tell you are a hoax.
[01:58:38.943 --> 01:58:42.105]  They also tell you that the rich don't pay taxes.
[01:58:42.105 --> 01:58:50.608]  But the IRS statistics of income show that the rich pay almost all the taxes because they have most of the income.
[01:58:50.608 --> 01:58:58.552]  And so, just about everything people think they know about the income tax system is wrong.
[01:58:58.552 --> 01:59:04.234]  Well, now, there are some international corporations, though, in offshoring, they are avoiding a lot of taxes.
[01:59:06.031 --> 01:59:08.952]  Uh, not necessarily.
[01:59:08.952 --> 01:59:12.214]  You see, you're taxed on your worldwide income.
[01:59:12.214 --> 01:59:29.100]  If you're paying, if you're a global corporation, say you're operating in the United States and say Europe, for example, and you're taxed in Germany and France, then that income is an offset to those earnings.
[01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:34.262]  And it is not, again, taxed by the United States government.
[01:59:36.588 --> 01:59:41.270]  It's not really the case that they can avoid taxes.
[01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.950]  All right, stay there.
[01:59:41.950 --> 01:59:42.950]  We got a break then.
[01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:46.971]  Why then do we see the mega corporations always lobbying for more taxes?
[01:59:46.971 --> 01:59:51.033]  Or the big health care insurance companies lobbying for health care?
[01:59:51.033 --> 01:59:56.514]  We'll ask Dr. Roberts that question when we come back and talk about where he sees this nation going.
[01:59:56.514 --> 01:59:59.195]  As he said last week, the economy is being destroyed by design.
[01:59:59.195 --> 02:00:00.716]  We'll get him to expand on that.
[02:00:00.716 --> 02:00:01.716]  Stay with us, Dr. Roberts.
[02:00:04.136 --> 02:00:05.537]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:00:05.537 --> 02:00:11.600]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:12.400]  That's right.
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.001]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:00:15.001 --> 02:00:22.745]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:00:22.745 --> 02:00:30.329]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:00:30.869 --> 02:00:36.353]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.

[02:03:22.088 --> 02:03:22.908]  Now something fun!
[02:03:23.208 --> 02:03:24.169]  It's springtime.
[02:03:24.169 --> 02:03:32.094]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[02:03:32.094 --> 02:03:32.995]  Here's the plan.

[02:03:44.242 --> 02:03:44.463]  Call 800-409-5777.
[02:03:48.135 --> 02:03:51.316]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, again our guest, joining us on April 15, 2010.
[02:04:17.529 --> 02:04:17.949]  Yes, well, I think
[02:04:41.827 --> 02:04:48.589]  To make people aware of that fact is probably more important than to know all the reasons why.
[02:04:48.589 --> 02:05:03.354]  A lot of it is a result of unintended consequences and most of the rest is a result of short-term greed.
[02:05:03.354 --> 02:05:10.736]  The way the incentive structure for top management corporations is structured, it gives them a very short
[02:05:11.297 --> 02:05:13.459]  term horizon.
[02:05:13.459 --> 02:05:15.901]  They want to know what the profits are next quarter.
[02:05:15.901 --> 02:05:20.205]  The longest horizon they have is four quarters.
[02:05:20.205 --> 02:05:32.995]  And in the way these things are structured, their bonuses that they get for performance far, far exceeds their regular salaries.
[02:05:32.995 --> 02:05:39.761]  So they make themselves multimillion dollar incomes by moving American jobs offshore.
[02:05:40.356 --> 02:05:51.905]  Because they then replace American labor with very, very inexpensive foreign labor in countries where there's huge surplus of unemployed labor.
[02:05:51.905 --> 02:05:59.451]  In China, for example, a couple hundred million unemployed people to draw on.
[02:05:59.451 --> 02:06:02.053]  So by severely
[02:06:03.553 --> 02:06:09.416]  Cutting their labor costs, the profits jump dramatically, and they get enormous bonuses.
[02:06:09.416 --> 02:06:12.698]  And that's the basic source of it.
[02:06:12.698 --> 02:06:21.543]  And it's why the prospects, the economic prospects for millions of Americans are gone.
[02:06:21.543 --> 02:06:26.746]  And not just people alive today, but future generations.
[02:06:26.746 --> 02:06:32.049]  The kinds of jobs that college graduates used to get are simply disappearing.
[02:06:33.171 --> 02:06:33.411]  There's
[02:06:52.694 --> 02:06:59.138]  The notion of some professional career that's been destroyed by the offshoring of the jobs.
[02:06:59.138 --> 02:07:03.941]  So it's having a tremendous adverse impact on the United States.
[02:07:03.941 --> 02:07:07.183]  And you and other economists talk about how these jobs aren't coming back.
[02:07:07.183 --> 02:07:11.586]  It took hundreds of years to build what we've got, now just a few decades to destroy it.
[02:07:12.647 --> 02:07:17.490]  There was open discussion by the IMF and World Bank now of the dollar going down.
[02:07:17.490 --> 02:07:31.461]  They're saying they need more bailouts, VAT taxes, sales taxes, carbon taxes, when any economist worth their salt knows in a stalling economy, you throw more taxes on, that will just accelerate the economy's implosion.
[02:07:31.461 --> 02:07:32.021]  That's right.
[02:07:32.021 --> 02:07:38.566]  You see, by wrecking the economy, they have worsened the trade deficit dramatically.
[02:07:38.566 --> 02:07:39.547]  They have worsened
[02:07:40.256 --> 02:07:49.721]  The Federal Budget Deficit, which they can no longer finance, and that is a threat to the dollar as a reserve currency, which is a threat to their power of the United States.
[02:07:49.721 --> 02:08:06.790]  And so now it looks like the hard-pressed Americans could be hit with new forms of oppressive taxation, such as a value-added tax on top of the income and Social Security tax and state sales taxes and property taxes.
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:27.010]  They have, by putting the dollar into jeopardy and having to rescue the dollar in order to rescue the power of the American military super state, they have to drive the population, or 96% of it, deeper into the ground.
[02:08:27.010 --> 02:08:31.152]  And that's exactly what is on the agenda.
[02:08:31.152 --> 02:08:36.575]  And the result for the American people is going to be horrific.
[02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:38.236]  They're going to be put through the mill
[02:08:39.554 --> 02:08:44.976]  In a way that people haven't experienced in the longest, longest time.
[02:08:44.976 --> 02:09:04.703]  Yeah, this taxation rate is much higher for my study than what caused the colonies to rebel, but also they were having fake courts, royal courts that bypass juries, and the right of Magna Carta and habeas corpus, and you look at all those parallels, they're identical to what led up to 1775, 1776, but magnified.
[02:09:09.219 --> 02:09:12.403]  Yes, it's all a repeat, isn't it?
[02:09:12.403 --> 02:09:24.877]  Habeas corpus is gone, due process is gone, the attorney-client privilege is gone, now they force attorneys to rat on their clients.
[02:09:24.877 --> 02:09:29.862]  But of course, you know, one difference is the population a couple hundred years ago was more feisty.
[02:09:32.197 --> 02:09:38.499]  And there wasn't much difference between the weaponry in the hands of people and the weaponry in the hands of the state.
[02:09:38.499 --> 02:09:40.259]  Stay there, let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:09:40.259 --> 02:09:43.220]  Long segment coming up with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:47.101]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[02:09:47.101 --> 02:09:52.622]  And when the show ends today at 3 o'clock central, we're premiering the new film, Invisible Empire at Prison Planet.
[02:09:52.622 --> 02:09:56.563]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:09:56.563 --> 02:09:59.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:10:02.554 --> 02:10:05.578]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:10:05.578 --> 02:10:10.905]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:10:10.905 --> 02:10:12.948]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:10:12.948 --> 02:10:17.954]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:10:17.954 --> 02:10:19.136]  How much do you want?
[02:10:19.136 --> 02:10:19.877]  When do you want it?
[02:10:20.257 --> 02:10:22.138]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:10:22.138 --> 02:10:23.199]  When will you need it?
[02:10:23.199 --> 02:10:25.400]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:26.741]  Will there be any food?
[02:10:26.741 --> 02:10:28.282]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:10:28.282 --> 02:10:33.546]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:10:33.546 --> 02:10:36.668]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:10:37.128 --> 02:10:40.949]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:10:40.949 --> 02:10:42.170]  How much will you need?
[02:10:42.170 --> 02:10:43.070]  We don't know.
[02:10:43.070 --> 02:10:44.191]  How much do you want?
[02:10:44.191 --> 02:10:45.111]  All you can get.
[02:10:45.111 --> 02:10:46.211]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:10:46.211 --> 02:10:49.253]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:10:49.253 --> 02:10:51.433]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:10:51.433 --> 02:10:52.454]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:02.988]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:11:02.988 --> 02:11:08.573]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:11:08.573 --> 02:11:13.597]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:11:13.597 --> 02:11:18.642]  It's true, seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:11:19.162 --> 02:11:24.386]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:11:24.386 --> 02:11:26.707]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[02:11:26.707 --> 02:11:31.510]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:32.631]  And here's the best part.
[02:11:32.631 --> 02:11:35.693]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:11:35.693 --> 02:11:39.316]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:11:39.316 --> 02:11:42.518]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:11:42.518 --> 02:11:44.739]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[02:11:44.739 --> 02:11:45.660]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:11:49.282 --> 02:11:53.527]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:11:53.527 --> 02:11:58.352]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:11:58.352 --> 02:12:00.755]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:05.141]  Remain in your houses.
[02:12:05.141 --> 02:12:10.902]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[02:12:10.902 --> 02:12:12.263]  Will they do it?
[02:12:12.263 --> 02:12:14.884]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[02:12:14.884 --> 02:12:21.345]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[02:12:21.345 --> 02:12:22.586]  Think it can't happen here?
[02:12:23.526 --> 02:12:27.810]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[02:12:27.810 --> 02:12:32.694]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[02:12:32.694 --> 02:12:37.618]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[02:12:37.618 --> 02:12:42.422]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[02:12:43.343 --> 02:12:51.773]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[02:12:51.773 --> 02:12:54.276]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[02:12:54.276 --> 02:12:57.339]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[02:12:57.339 --> 02:13:00.263]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[02:13:18.849 --> 02:13:23.631]  Listeners, we're now shipping Invisible Empire New World Order Defined on DVD.
[02:13:23.631 --> 02:13:25.392]  You can also support us by purchasing it.
[02:13:25.392 --> 02:13:27.353]  It's part of a win-win.
[02:13:27.353 --> 02:13:30.514]  Exposing the New World Order, the global corporate fascist state.
[02:13:30.514 --> 02:13:31.614]  Two plus hour film.
[02:13:31.614 --> 02:13:32.795]  Jason Burmess, I produced it.
[02:13:33.473 --> 02:13:45.447]  Now available at InfoWars.com, we have Police State, The Rise of FEMA coming out next week that I've made over the last year, proving this police state control grid and that the FEMA camps do indeed exist.
[02:13:45.447 --> 02:13:48.290]  Going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:13:49.231 --> 02:13:49.251]  I
[02:14:12.017 --> 02:14:21.804]  Well, Alex, I don't know how much of it goes on, but what we do know for certain is that they have removed the barriers to it and can do it whenever they want.
[02:14:21.804 --> 02:14:25.387]  They can grab whoever they want.
[02:14:25.387 --> 02:14:36.796]  We had, you know, the head of Homeland Security fairly recently saying that Homeland Security was shifting its attention from foreign terrorists
[02:14:37.697 --> 02:14:41.479]  To domestic American extremists.
[02:14:41.479 --> 02:14:49.442]  And we had not long ago the arrest of a blonde, blue-eyed woman as a terrorist.
[02:14:49.442 --> 02:14:54.704]  So they're already moving away from the Muslim threat.
[02:14:54.704 --> 02:15:00.006]  They used that to get all of those police state measures in place.
[02:15:00.006 --> 02:15:04.428]  And now they can apply them to the general population.
[02:15:05.423 --> 02:15:11.286]  Alex, before we go off into that, let me say one more thing about the income tax.
[02:15:11.286 --> 02:15:12.547]  Absolutely.
[02:15:12.547 --> 02:15:23.313]  Many progressives and liberals get disturbed at criticisms of the income tax because they think it's used for the poor.
[02:15:23.313 --> 02:15:32.658]  I was on a show just the other day where the host thought the income tax paid for public schools and roads.
[02:15:33.733 --> 02:15:44.358]  And was unaware that the road system was built with gasoline tax and that the public schools are funded with property tax.
[02:15:44.358 --> 02:15:53.421]  But, what, let me just make a point about the use of the income tax revenues.
[02:15:53.421 --> 02:15:57.023]  The last week David Lindorff published an article
[02:15:57.904 --> 02:16:24.910]  In which he said, if you add up all of the military spending, not just the Pentagon's budget, but all of the other related military spending that's dispersed throughout the budget and other departments, the Supplementalist Wars and the CIA and so forth, that it comes to 53% of the federal income tax revenues.
[02:16:26.144 --> 02:16:38.014]  So that more than half of the federal income tax revenues are used to fund the military.
[02:16:38.014 --> 02:16:39.896]  Now this is an extraordinary thing.
[02:16:39.896 --> 02:16:45.280]  I don't think it was this bad during the dark ages.
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:52.206]  But if you have the military function of the government, which has now
[02:16:54.435 --> 02:16:59.661]  53% of the unserved labor goes to support.
[02:16:59.661 --> 02:17:02.063]  This is an extraordinary thing.
[02:17:02.063 --> 02:17:17.098]  And it gives the military security complex such power, because a lot of these funds are recycled into political campaign contributions, that it's almost impossible to budge this.
[02:17:18.973 --> 02:17:40.103]  Now if you look at the size of the American budget and military spending, the total thing that Lindor presents, and you add in that of all of our allies in Europe, Japan, and in the nations that are friendly to us, it accounts for two-thirds of world military spending.
[02:17:40.103 --> 02:17:40.543]  And so how
[02:17:41.567 --> 02:17:43.448]  Do we face a threat?
[02:17:43.448 --> 02:17:44.990]  How is Iran a threat?
[02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:55.698]  Now this is really very interesting because Iran's annual military budget is 4.8 billion dollars.
[02:17:55.698 --> 02:18:00.862]  Cost of maybe, what, two weeks of our war in Afghanistan.
[02:18:00.862 --> 02:18:05.986]  4.8 billion is what the Pentagon spends on child care and recreation.
[02:18:07.814 --> 02:18:11.835]  It's what it spends on its replacement helicopters.
[02:18:11.835 --> 02:18:16.016]  Or one or two stealth bombers.
[02:18:16.016 --> 02:18:24.819]  So here is Iran with a military budget equal to what the Pentagon spends on childcare and recreation and it's a threat to America?
[02:18:26.283 --> 02:18:27.163]  It's amazing.
[02:18:27.163 --> 02:18:36.426]  Now, going back, you were Ronald Reagan's chief financial market advisor, the father of Reaganomics, head of policy at the Treasury.
[02:18:36.426 --> 02:18:37.726]  What about the Grace Commission?
[02:18:37.726 --> 02:18:44.828]  Because my reading of that, it boils down to not one red cent of it goes to the American people or to run the country.
[02:18:44.828 --> 02:18:50.310]  From my reading, much of the money goes to interest on the debt, does it not?
[02:18:50.310 --> 02:18:50.830]  Well, now.
[02:18:52.751 --> 02:19:02.478]  And one way they are keeping that down is the Federal Reserve is buying so much of the debt in order to hold down the interest rate.
[02:19:02.478 --> 02:19:11.063]  But the minute that blows up, which it has to sooner or later, the cost of carrying the debt is going to be horrific.
[02:19:11.063 --> 02:19:15.166]  You remember the short-term interest rates that Volcker stuck on?
[02:19:15.166 --> 02:19:18.969]  17%?
[02:19:18.969 --> 02:19:20.770]  I can remember when long-term treasuries
[02:19:21.411 --> 02:19:27.535]  When I went into the Treasury, the interest rate on long-term Treasuries was 16%.
[02:19:27.535 --> 02:19:30.077]  Can you imagine those kinds of interest rates today?
[02:19:30.077 --> 02:19:31.277]  Well, let me ask you that.
[02:19:31.277 --> 02:19:34.339]  They're now talking about raising interest rates.
[02:19:34.339 --> 02:19:35.880]  A, what will that do?
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:47.188]  And then B, we've got Volcker, Obama, and people like Glenn Beck calling for sales taxes, value-added taxes, carbon taxes, saying we've got to pay this.
[02:19:49.022 --> 02:19:58.285]  Well, the carbon tax, in my opinion, is something that Wall Street and corporations have cooked up.
[02:19:58.285 --> 02:20:05.407]  And the purpose of the carbon tax is to make pollution profitable.
[02:20:05.407 --> 02:20:12.288]  Because you can now buy and sell the right to pollute, and of course Wall Street will turn it into derivatives.
[02:20:12.288 --> 02:20:13.989]  Sure, but what will that do to the economy?
[02:20:17.287 --> 02:20:22.769]  I don't think that that is the threat to the economy.
[02:20:22.769 --> 02:20:36.576]  It may not help, but the threat is another unregulated, over-the-counter, derivative instrument in which pollution becomes profitable.
[02:20:36.576 --> 02:20:39.597]  So it doesn't help the environment.
[02:20:39.597 --> 02:20:40.658]  What does VAT do?
[02:20:42.509 --> 02:20:42.990]  I think?
[02:20:57.637 --> 02:21:02.801]  It taxes the value added to a product at every stage.
[02:21:02.801 --> 02:21:13.728]  So if we say, okay, we go dig up the iron ore, and so the act of digging the ore out of the ground, that makes it more valuable because it's now accessible.
[02:21:13.728 --> 02:21:21.233]  So the difference in the value of the ore in the ground and the value of the ore dug out, that difference is value added and it's taxed.
[02:21:22.148 --> 02:21:26.491]  And then the iron ore is converted into iron or steel.
[02:21:26.491 --> 02:21:29.994]  And that is another enhancement of value.
[02:21:29.994 --> 02:21:31.555]  And that value is taxed.
[02:21:31.555 --> 02:21:35.237]  And then the steel is converted into products.
[02:21:35.237 --> 02:21:38.300]  Cars, steel beams, whatever, sheet metal.
[02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:41.202]  Then it's packaged, then it's shipped, then it's sold.
[02:21:41.202 --> 02:21:44.424]  It's taxed at every level.
[02:21:44.424 --> 02:21:50.108]  And, you know, the value-added taxes in Europe are 20, 22 percent.
[02:21:50.108 --> 02:21:51.129]  They may be higher now.
[02:21:52.026 --> 02:21:58.610]  And so that then becomes an enormous sales tax.
[02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:00.711]  That's why cars cost so much in Europe.
[02:22:00.711 --> 02:22:10.396]  That's why washing machines and dryers and appliances, refrigerators and stoves, they all have this tax.
[02:22:10.396 --> 02:22:11.917]  And fuel!
[02:22:11.917 --> 02:22:12.978]  And fuel.
[02:22:12.978 --> 02:22:17.120]  So it's a way of suppressing the
[02:22:18.654 --> 02:22:22.035]  Purchasing power and living standards of the people.
[02:22:22.035 --> 02:22:28.997]  And then meanwhile, if China and India and others don't have a VAT, won't that drive the few industries we have left out of the country?
[02:22:28.997 --> 02:22:39.799]  Well, you see, the value-added tax is rebated on exports.
[02:22:39.799 --> 02:22:42.960]  But it's applied to imports.
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:46.881]  So, a country that has a value-added tax
[02:22:48.041 --> 02:22:51.682]  In a trade situation, has an advantage over one that doesn't.
[02:22:51.682 --> 02:23:00.344]  Because when Europe exports these products to us, they rebate that tax to everybody.
[02:23:00.344 --> 02:23:04.725]  But we don't have any industry really left, as you've said, so that isn't good.
[02:23:04.725 --> 02:23:12.106]  And we don't have a value-added tax, and so it doesn't come in taxed.
[02:23:12.106 --> 02:23:16.387]  But if it goes from one value-added country to another,
[02:23:17.821 --> 02:23:22.623]  When it leaves, it's rebated, but when it gets to the other country, it's charged.
[02:23:22.623 --> 02:23:23.403]  All right.
[02:23:23.403 --> 02:23:29.906]  Doctor, I want to move quickly through some other subjects, but going back to overall taxes, because you wanted to come on today, and we're honored to have you.
[02:23:29.906 --> 02:23:35.488]  Specifically, other points you'd like to make about the income tax, and I want to ask you, where do you see all this leading?
[02:23:35.488 --> 02:23:39.830]  Because, I mean, clearly, this is a vertical integration, a criminal consolidation.
[02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:44.531]  They have no appearances of even slowing down, only accelerating.
[02:23:44.531 --> 02:23:45.832]  How do you see this unfolding?
[02:23:47.648 --> 02:23:57.857]  Well, the people and the vast majority of Americans will find a sharp decline in their living standard.
[02:23:57.857 --> 02:24:13.232]  And there's no way around it, because not only are the jobs, the best jobs, disappearing, but all of these taxes will, particularly a value-added tax,
[02:24:14.085 --> 02:24:15.406]  We're good to go.
[02:24:32.324 --> 02:24:42.967]  Expanding on that, the trick again is they've had fake conservatives promoting VAT for almost two decades, saying we're going to get rid of the income tax.
[02:24:42.967 --> 02:24:47.848]  But now they're saying, oh no, we're going to have the income tax and the VAT, but don't worry, it'll only be 2%.
[02:24:47.848 --> 02:24:50.288]  Well, that's how the federal income tax started.
[02:24:50.288 --> 02:24:51.649]  Right, that's right.
[02:24:51.649 --> 02:25:00.631]  You know, as we said earlier in your program today, the reason the income tax amendment passed, the constitutional amendment, to permit one,
[02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:11.518]  Was that the vast majority of states didn't have anybody living in them that had income higher enough to be taxed under the original proposal.
[02:25:11.518 --> 02:25:15.181]  So sure, once you have... But the same thing happened to state sales taxes.
[02:25:15.181 --> 02:25:20.266]  I can remember when the first sales tax was 1%.
[02:25:20.266 --> 02:25:21.026]  What are they now?
[02:25:21.026 --> 02:25:21.227]  6, 7, 8.
[02:25:21.227 --> 02:25:25.270]  So if it's a 2% value-added tax, it won't be 2% very long.
[02:25:30.706 --> 02:25:36.768]  Rise up, as in Europe, they're now, as I said, they're 20% or more.
[02:25:36.768 --> 02:25:44.510]  Now, where all this may end is that the dollar may simply collapse.
[02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:48.132]  It may lose its reserve currency role.
[02:25:48.132 --> 02:25:55.474]  In which case, it will be the end of the evil empire because the wars won't be, you can't finance them.
[02:25:56.530 --> 02:26:07.218]  The only way they can finance all of these wars and all of this military spending is that the dollar is a reserve currency and we can pay our bills simply by printing money.
[02:26:07.218 --> 02:26:09.180]  Nobody else can do that.
[02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:24.632]  So if we lose that role, then you will see a collapse in the empire and you will also see a collapse in living standards because it would have a similar effect as a value-added tax in reducing people's incomes.
[02:26:25.515 --> 02:26:35.199]  Because the value of it would fall dramatically, and so all of the imports on which we are dependent would rise in price.
[02:26:35.199 --> 02:26:39.501]  And this would also have the effect of reducing Americans' real incomes.
[02:26:39.501 --> 02:26:47.844]  So for the future, Alex, it's going to be different than the past when people could look forward to a rising level of income.
[02:26:47.844 --> 02:26:52.986]  Now, I'm afraid, they'll have to look forward to declining levels of real income.
[02:26:53.470 --> 02:26:56.755]  All right, I want to take a few calls here in the end of this segment and the next with you.
[02:26:56.755 --> 02:26:59.358]  We really appreciate you spending time with us.
[02:26:59.358 --> 02:27:05.987]  But, you know, we know there's some global organization of this, but it's driven by the greed, the short-term view.
[02:27:05.987 --> 02:27:07.809]  But at the UN level, it's a long-term view.
[02:27:08.430 --> 02:27:15.295]  But it lends credence to what you're saying, that it's just a bunch of looters, and not organized at some point.
[02:27:15.295 --> 02:27:23.041]  Because I'm reading in Texas, and in Ohio, and in Michigan, and New Jersey, and all over, more than 10 states going bankrupt or on the verge.
[02:27:23.041 --> 02:27:27.045]  Some sheriffs and police departments slashing by more than half.
[02:27:27.045 --> 02:27:29.506]  Police saying, buy your own guns to protect yourself.
[02:27:30.507 --> 02:27:46.651]  As taxes go up, more and more goes to interest on the debt and to corporate welfare and actual road warrior type scenarios where one county in Ohio that has over 100,000 people will have one cop on duty for every shift from 116 that they had.
[02:27:46.651 --> 02:27:50.852]  I mean this, we're looking at potential road warrior type collapse.
[02:27:53.764 --> 02:27:54.804]  Could be.
[02:27:54.804 --> 02:27:55.564]  It could be.
[02:27:55.564 --> 02:28:04.866]  I think most likely, though, the last thing government will let go of are the forces that protect them.
[02:28:04.866 --> 02:28:09.327]  And the notion that the police protect the public is probably not correct.
[02:28:09.327 --> 02:28:13.488]  The police protect the government.
[02:28:13.488 --> 02:28:18.629]  If you think the FBI protects you, you're wrong.
[02:28:18.629 --> 02:28:20.989]  Just like the military doesn't protect
[02:28:21.431 --> 02:28:26.053]  The people, it protects the government that pays its salary.
[02:28:26.053 --> 02:28:39.340]  So I'm not sure that a lot of the gang activity won't come from police because they're an organized armed force.
[02:28:40.547 --> 02:28:43.309]  And people are not organized.
[02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:44.590]  That's a key point.
[02:28:44.590 --> 02:28:54.016]  They said in Ohio, they were going to keep 49 of the 116 deputies and that now only one would be on patrol for the citizens, the rest out collecting revenue.
[02:28:54.016 --> 02:28:57.018]  So now they're admitting we're here to collect revenue.
[02:28:57.018 --> 02:28:58.018]  We're not going to protect you.
[02:28:58.018 --> 02:29:00.440]  They actually say that.
[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:01.140]  That's right.
[02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:06.564]  And, you know, they can collect revenues in a different way than taxes and just shake you down.
[02:29:07.842 --> 02:29:10.004]  So who knows, Alex?
[02:29:10.004 --> 02:29:15.508]  We don't need to get this far into it.
[02:29:15.508 --> 02:29:16.749]  We can't predict what's
[02:29:18.993 --> 02:29:19.173]  Yes.
[02:29:19.173 --> 02:29:19.253]  Yes.
[02:29:43.732 --> 02:29:44.152]  Consumers
[02:29:54.465 --> 02:30:11.490]  I think that is enough to make us disturbed and wary when you see the people becoming economically weaker and the government becoming less accountable and more powerful, less restrained by law, by the Constitution.
[02:30:11.490 --> 02:30:14.251]  And that is the real dilemma that we're in.
[02:30:14.251 --> 02:30:16.071]  Can I hold up my book real quickly?
[02:30:16.071 --> 02:30:17.232]  Absolutely.
[02:30:17.232 --> 02:30:24.254]  This is the latest book I've written, and a lot of people who get motivated
[02:30:24.747 --> 02:30:27.288]  To try to learn something about economics.
[02:30:27.288 --> 02:30:29.389]  They get a book and they try to read it and they can't.
[02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:30.650]  It's full of jargon.
[02:30:30.650 --> 02:30:31.991]  It's got equations.
[02:30:31.991 --> 02:30:33.432]  It's dense.
[02:30:33.432 --> 02:30:38.014]  This book is written like a column for a newspaper.
[02:30:39.346 --> 02:30:41.688]  And people can follow it.
[02:30:41.688 --> 02:30:45.532]  You're a great writer, and we've got the book holding it up on TV ourselves.
[02:30:45.532 --> 02:30:47.454]  How the Economy Was Lost, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:30:47.454 --> 02:30:48.955]  I promise to take calls.
[02:30:48.955 --> 02:30:49.796]  We're almost out of time.
[02:30:49.796 --> 02:30:50.757]  We're gonna come back.
[02:30:50.757 --> 02:30:53.880]  Quick questions from our callers for Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:54.401]  We'll be right back.
[02:31:02.873 --> 02:31:09.880]  It's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements.
[02:31:09.880 --> 02:31:18.488]  But isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture overpriced prescription drugs that produce dangerous side effects?
[02:31:18.488 --> 02:31:23.273]  Do your own research and compare the herbal supplements offered at ResearchedHerbs.com.

[02:31:50.409 --> 02:31:56.054]  Call 1-800-973-1486 or go to researchedherbs.com.

[02:31:58.616 --> 02:32:01.298]  All the goodness with none of the side effects.
[02:32:06.515 --> 02:32:07.756]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:07.756 --> 02:32:11.438]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:11.438 --> 02:32:13.919]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:13.919 --> 02:32:19.102]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:19.782 --> 02:32:26.469]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:26.469 --> 02:32:32.436]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:32.436 --> 02:32:36.120]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:32:36.620 --> 02:32:37.861]  Don't answer it!
[02:33:03.968 --> 02:33:11.755]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings, knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call Zero Debt in 90 Days.

[02:33:19.902 --> 02:33:24.186]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[02:33:55.760 --> 02:34:08.490]  Alright, Lord Christopher Monkton's coming up.
[02:34:08.490 --> 02:34:11.192]  For those of you that are holding, you'll get to talk to him.
[02:34:11.192 --> 02:34:12.893]  We're just not going to hang up on the callers.
[02:34:12.893 --> 02:34:14.074]  I should have gone to your calls.
[02:34:14.074 --> 02:34:15.295]  Roberts has so much knowledge.
[02:34:15.295 --> 02:34:17.037]  I have so many questions.
[02:34:17.037 --> 02:34:18.178]  Jamming in a few calls.
[02:34:18.178 --> 02:34:22.101]  Jim in Missouri, you're on the air with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:34:22.101 --> 02:34:22.841]  Hey, Mr. Roberts.
[02:34:24.432 --> 02:34:26.233]  I mean, it's really nice to talk to you.
[02:34:26.233 --> 02:34:36.941]  You've got a lot of experience on, you know, taxes and everything else, and where you came from in life as far as all the information that's been provided to you.
[02:34:36.941 --> 02:34:51.511]  I guess my question to you would be, in all of your research, what would the average individual, knowing... Okay, so they read your books and follow some of the... Yeah, what do we do about this?
[02:34:51.511 --> 02:34:52.172]  Is that the question?
[02:34:52.830 --> 02:34:55.331]  Well, yeah.
[02:34:55.331 --> 02:34:59.452]  The average individual is just going to take this as a grain of salt.
[02:34:59.452 --> 02:35:06.053]  They don't have no direction to counter-direct the government.
[02:35:06.053 --> 02:35:16.096]  So I guess my question to you is, if you were able to provide some sort of a movement, how would you... I understand the question.
[02:35:16.096 --> 02:35:16.956]  Thank you, Jim.
[02:35:16.956 --> 02:35:19.057]  I mean, what do we do about this, Dr. Roberts?
[02:35:20.703 --> 02:35:28.245]  Well, we will not be able to do anything about it until it just falls apart.
[02:35:28.245 --> 02:35:38.088]  Though, you know, last week in one of the stands, part of the former Soviet Empire was in Kyrgyzstan.
[02:35:38.088 --> 02:35:43.249]  All of a sudden the people just revolted and threw the government out.
[02:35:43.249 --> 02:35:49.191]  And they did this despite being fired on by troops.
[02:35:51.087 --> 02:36:03.525]  So at some point, maybe people will have nothing left to lose and will revolt.
[02:36:03.525 --> 02:36:04.687]  The only other solution is
[02:36:06.437 --> 02:36:15.841]  A long-term solution of restoring veneration of the Constitution so that people say that's what's important is protecting the Constitution.
[02:36:15.841 --> 02:36:21.464]  We can't do anything that undermines the Constitution or the restraints that it places on government.
[02:36:21.464 --> 02:36:22.765]  But that would take a long time.
[02:36:22.765 --> 02:36:25.206]  The law schools would have to have a change of mind.
[02:36:25.206 --> 02:36:28.287]  They would have to teach a generation of law students.
[02:36:28.287 --> 02:36:33.990]  They would have to enter into the judiciary, especially the federal judiciary.
[02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:37.912]  Uh, the bar associations would have to change.
[02:36:37.912 --> 02:36:42.695]  Instead, the criminals have gotten in and brought in all their people, but I agree, we need to put out the message.
[02:36:42.695 --> 02:36:43.336]  Gangsters.
[02:36:43.336 --> 02:36:44.156]  Yeah, gangsters.
[02:36:44.156 --> 02:36:45.117]  Looting, gangsters.
[02:36:45.117 --> 02:36:48.659]  We have a government of looters.
[02:36:48.659 --> 02:36:49.600]  Possibly.
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:55.724]  Or we have a government, rather, controlled by organized looting groups.
[02:36:55.724 --> 02:37:00.988]  The big offshoring corporations, Wall Street, these are all gangster operations.
[02:37:02.435 --> 02:37:05.037]  Well, absolutely, by every yardstick, by every measurement.
[02:37:05.037 --> 02:37:15.186]  But I think it's important also just to point out their criminals and give people the alternative of the Republic, of the Bill of Rights, of the Constitution, so that people can recognize this tyranny and counter.
[02:37:15.186 --> 02:37:25.856]  I mean, I'm sure you saw the Wall Street Journal, where they admit that NBC and others have propaganda placement or behavior placement in the shows, brainwashing people with federal funds.
[02:37:25.856 --> 02:37:27.157]  Right.
[02:37:27.157 --> 02:37:27.537]  That's right.
[02:37:30.555 --> 02:37:30.695]  Are you
[02:37:46.994 --> 02:37:54.738]  Use of propaganda is very difficult for American people to ever get a firm grasp on what the real situation is.
[02:37:54.738 --> 02:38:00.201]  They're too busy trying to have a living, pay their rent, hold on to their home, or whatever.
[02:38:00.201 --> 02:38:01.202]  Doc, we're out of time.
[02:38:01.202 --> 02:38:02.982]  I appreciate the hour on Tax Day.
[02:38:02.982 --> 02:38:09.706]  And I know you're about to take some time off, and hopefully you'll be back doing talk radio in the future, how the economy was lost, the war of the worlds.
[02:38:09.706 --> 02:38:11.707]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, here's the book.
[02:38:11.707 --> 02:38:13.468]  Dr. Roberts, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:38:14.028 --> 02:38:16.290]  Well, thank you for sharing your audience, Alex.
[02:38:16.290 --> 02:38:16.591]  You bet.
[02:38:16.591 --> 02:38:17.151]  God bless you.
[02:38:17.151 --> 02:38:19.053]  Have a good weekend coming up.
[02:38:19.053 --> 02:38:21.075]  Lord Christopher Monckton coming up on a host of issues.
[02:38:21.075 --> 02:38:23.738]  He's hosting one of the big tea parties in D.C.
[02:38:23.738 --> 02:38:27.261]  Don't forget, we've got two new films launching this week and next week.
[02:38:27.261 --> 02:38:29.964]  Today premiering in two hours.
[02:38:31.007 --> 02:38:40.274]  Premiering two hours from now at PrisonPlanet.TV, Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, and the next week, Police State, The Rise of FEMA.
[02:38:40.274 --> 02:38:42.515]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:38:42.515 --> 02:38:48.279]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:38:48.279 --> 02:38:51.482]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:38:53.939 --> 02:38:57.902]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:38:57.902 --> 02:39:06.769]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:39:06.769 --> 02:39:11.393]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:39:11.393 --> 02:39:22.222]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:39:22.842 --> 02:39:32.344]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
