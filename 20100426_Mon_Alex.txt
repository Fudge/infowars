[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.040]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.040 --> 00:34.560]  jones max keiser is our guest he has two different international television
[00:34.560 --> 00:43.760]  programs on rt and press tv he is a tv presenter radio host entrepreneur
[00:43.760 --> 00:46.920]  broadcaster and journalist he is the inventor of the virtual specialist
[00:46.920 --> 00:52.480]  technology prediction markets hollywood stock exchange and much more he is the
[00:52.480 --> 00:59.760]  presenter of oracle vbc he's just aljazeera huffington post you name it
[00:59.760 --> 01:05.240]  and we appreciate him joining his former wall street broker you know he's been
[01:05.240 --> 01:09.000]  saying for years that goldman sacks is engineering financial collapse to
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.280]  consolidate and destroy their competition now that is mainstream news
[01:14.280 --> 01:18.360]  here's the one in guardian now we know the truth the financial meltdown wasn't
[01:18.360 --> 01:25.240]  a mistake it was a con and we have record bonuses now to be paid to goldman
[01:25.240 --> 01:31.320]  sacks just in england 3.5 billion pounds and of course you notice the intergroup
[01:31.320 --> 01:36.440]  jp morgan chase and other groups that that own the private fellow reserve
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.320]  holding company they're all making record profits while hoarding all the bailout
[01:40.320 --> 01:46.200]  money and why is the sec indicted goldman sacks some of their members
[01:46.200 --> 01:49.920]  civilly well they'll probably give them a five million dollar fine and slap them
[01:49.920 --> 01:52.560]  on the wrist and give somebody probation for the trillions that have been
[01:52.560 --> 01:57.840]  stolen but joining us is max keiser to discuss this will also get into the fbi
[01:57.840 --> 02:01.720]  saying our number one threat is us the american people bill clinton says you
[02:01.720 --> 02:05.360]  know if the tea parties don't shut up people don't criticizing wall street
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.440]  that a terror attack is going to happen and it's our fault I mean they're out in
[02:09.440 --> 02:12.920]  the open folks getting ready to stage terror attacks here and we'll take your
[02:12.920 --> 02:20.480]  calls on that subject max keiser good to have you here with us yeah well I tell
[02:20.480 --> 02:24.520]  you things are getting crazy let's get into goldman sacks and financial
[02:24.520 --> 02:30.000]  terrorism right well as you point out I've been talking about this for a
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.960]  number of years basically they have been involved as I have other wall street
[02:36.960 --> 02:44.640]  banks and setting up banks to fail because they can profit on the failure
[02:44.640 --> 02:50.800]  so just like we've talked about before about building seven during the 911
[02:50.800 --> 02:54.520]  incident there were many options traders that made a lot of money because the
[02:54.520 --> 02:59.400]  building seven collapsed now here's goldman sacks same thing they create a
[02:59.400 --> 03:06.080]  fund they create bonds that they build to collapse that they rig with financial
[03:06.080 --> 03:10.000]  dynamite so that it collapses and they make money on the collapse it's
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.520]  financial terrorism it's a controlled demolition that's how they make a lot
[03:14.520 --> 03:22.680]  of their money that's how they make most of their money well there's no doubt
[03:22.680 --> 03:25.960]  that the stimulus has run out and now they're saying okay maybe it is a
[03:25.960 --> 03:31.880]  depression we need more money Obama's new regulation package allows the top
[03:31.880 --> 03:36.000]  banks and brokerage firms to through their regulators that they control to
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.040]  basically feed other smaller regional healthy banks into their maw and attacks
[03:41.040 --> 03:44.840]  on smaller institutions that's paid through bailout money to them I mean
[03:44.840 --> 03:48.920]  this is we've got Gordon Brown calling for a world government oven for and by
[03:48.920 --> 03:54.600]  the banks I mean it's just getting crazy well you know it's interesting
[03:54.600 --> 03:59.080]  because Lloyd Blank find the CEO Goldman Sachs of course famously said that he
[03:59.080 --> 04:05.160]  was doing God's work when he and his cohorts are creating all of these
[04:05.160 --> 04:11.600]  problems for everybody and creating a blackmail situations and extortion to
[04:11.600 --> 04:16.240]  get their buddy Hank Paulson to extort seven hundred billion if you recall back
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.080]  there at the end of 2008 in front of Congress but apparently he's angered the
[04:20.080 --> 04:25.600]  gods because now in Iceland the volcano is blowing up and it's what's
[04:25.600 --> 04:30.600]  remarkable Alex is that this is similar almost exactly what happened during the
[04:30.600 --> 04:34.120]  pre the French Revolution actually the French Revolution started when a
[04:34.120 --> 04:39.240]  volcano in Iceland blew up it caused the global problems of agriculture and
[04:39.240 --> 04:43.480]  this was the the what's that you know what you know what I mean it's like a
[04:43.480 --> 04:47.920]  comment being a portend of doom it's like God was showing people of the
[04:47.920 --> 04:52.280]  earth freezing solid basically right as they tried to pass their global warming
[04:52.280 --> 04:56.760]  takeover now you're right I'd forgotten that historically mega volcano
[04:56.760 --> 05:10.240]  shrouding Europe in dust stay there big brother mainstream media government
[05:10.240 --> 05:17.840]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[05:17.840 --> 05:28.160]  network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones dedicated to the fact that
[05:28.160 --> 05:32.240]  it's a hundred percent the military industrial complex that controls both
[05:32.240 --> 05:36.200]  parties is going to stage a terror attack the blame it on people that want to
[05:36.200 --> 05:39.680]  end the Fed people that want to audit the Fed that want to arrest the people
[05:39.680 --> 05:43.280]  that run Goldman Sachs that controlled all the regulatory positions and are
[05:43.280 --> 05:48.600]  just ripping our country off they're ripping off countries from Chile to New
[05:48.600 --> 05:54.600]  Zealand to Greece to Iceland and they've been building this propaganda up they
[05:54.600 --> 05:58.200]  claim the tea parties are right-wing it becomes a self-fulfilling Republican
[05:58.200 --> 06:03.040]  prophecy then they began and what are they doing they're not gonna let it
[06:03.040 --> 06:09.160]  happen they're going to make sure that we becomes a service to sec sector
[06:09.160 --> 06:16.240]  society think of the word servitude service surf hey look at the great
[06:16.240 --> 06:24.200]  jobs you want to be a cashier at a 7-eleven hey I got one for you how
[06:24.200 --> 06:29.800]  about working at Walmart at two in the morning and crawling between shelves to
[06:29.800 --> 06:35.360]  stop them that's what they're doing to the American public and then they're
[06:35.360 --> 06:40.760]  gonna take us to war when all else fails we're gonna get back into that when we
[06:40.760 --> 06:44.040]  start the next segment that's the key here and I've got a whole host of issues
[06:44.040 --> 06:47.960]  I want to go through with the top trends forecaster in the world wrote the book
[06:47.960 --> 06:52.280]  on it stunning accuracy in his trends again we're so honored to have him
[06:52.280 --> 06:56.280]  trendsresearch.com Gerald Salentes his name I'm Alex Jones if you just joined
[06:56.280 --> 07:01.240]  us but I want to back you up on what you just said animal ID premises ID on both
[07:01.240 --> 07:04.760]  sides of my family I come from farmers and ranchers they come in with a
[07:04.760 --> 07:09.280]  regulations they say you've got to have premises ID animal ID you've got to have
[07:09.280 --> 07:15.600]  a $14 tag per chicken in your small chicken coop they have federal inspectors
[07:15.600 --> 07:21.120]  that the news admits are focused on small farms and small outfits $14 tag per
[07:21.120 --> 07:25.000]  turkey you can only sell the chicken for three four bucks to one of the big
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.200]  groups one of the big combines that processes them but then Tyson chicken is
[07:30.200 --> 07:36.140]  exempt and gets one ID per 10,000 chickens because they wrote the
[07:36.140 --> 07:40.680]  regulations to shut down their competition they allow all this dirty
[07:40.680 --> 07:44.480]  beef to be shipped in from all over the world they put more regulations on US
[07:44.480 --> 07:48.720]  beef producers and our own news media put out today that our beef is dirty when
[07:48.720 --> 07:52.360]  our beef is some of the cleanest and best in the world everything by these
[07:52.360 --> 07:56.760]  globalist is economic warfare expanding on that they're trying to shut down
[07:56.760 --> 08:01.040]  vitamins and mineral companies globally through the Codex Alimentarius any
[08:01.040 --> 08:05.880]  industry that's grassroots they're coming after it exactly it squeezed the
[08:05.880 --> 08:11.280]  little guy they're doing it with taxes they're doing a regulations if you look
[08:11.280 --> 08:16.320]  what happens I mean you see it all the time that they crush at this the small
[08:16.320 --> 08:21.400]  people for the smallest infraction and they let the big guys get away with
[08:21.400 --> 08:26.040]  murder literally and look what look right here in New York State it's great
[08:26.040 --> 08:30.960]  we had Elliot Spitzer the esteemed governor you know he was caught with a
[08:30.960 --> 08:35.800]  prostitute remember a couple of months back and this is the guy that he was
[08:35.800 --> 08:41.520]  he was disgraced out of office and this is the guy that wrote the rule that they
[08:41.520 --> 08:46.560]  would prosecute John's that were caught with laws he gets caught they don't
[08:46.560 --> 08:52.160]  prosecute him and now he has his own talk show you couldn't do better than this
[08:52.160 --> 09:01.800]  one the big get a free ride this is in America this is France just before the
[09:01.800 --> 09:07.880]  reign of terror let them eat cake they're pushing it right in everybody's
[09:07.880 --> 09:14.280]  face we cannot see it more blatantly done than the way they're doing it every
[09:14.280 --> 09:19.160]  day and there's a method of the madness they want to push us into armed
[09:19.160 --> 09:23.160]  rebellion they're involved in these militias and everywhere else trying to
[09:23.160 --> 09:27.560]  provocateur us into violence we'll talk about where Joe Salente sees the
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.720]  domestic situation going what is the breaking point will there be physical
[09:32.720 --> 09:37.520]  revolution why is the system trying to kick that off early it's not so they
[09:37.520 --> 09:43.280]  can nip it in the bud but first the March to the Third World War it's not
[09:43.280 --> 09:46.760]  just Gerald Salente saying that other world leaders are saying this could be
[09:46.760 --> 09:53.360]  the start of World War three by design stay with us we're on the March the
[09:53.360 --> 10:02.600]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network they helped to create a
[10:02.600 --> 10:07.160]  new world order we are part of a new world order a new world order based
[10:07.160 --> 10:12.280]  upon collective natural invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalist
[10:12.280 --> 10:16.520]  through their own words and documents the new world order really is a tool for
[10:16.520 --> 10:20.600]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.360]  control the United Nations would take over America the tri-lateral Commission
[10:25.360 --> 10:29.880]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and
[10:29.880 --> 10:33.800]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[10:33.800 --> 10:37.800]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a
[10:37.800 --> 10:41.520]  world constitution for the global financial system global governance with
[10:41.520 --> 10:45.800]  the establishment of the G20 so it's gonna be an inner ruling elite and then

[15:16.400 --> 15:20.680]  up here and just ask quick questions but with key points I know governments of
[15:20.680 --> 15:24.200]  stage terror I know Operation Northwoods is an official US government plan to
[15:24.200 --> 15:27.880]  stage 9-11 style attacks I don't put it past these bankers this isn't our
[15:27.880 --> 15:32.040]  government anymore these corporate mafia from staging a dirty bomb or even a
[15:32.040 --> 15:36.280]  nuke or busting somebody in a fake attack imagine the clamp down they could
[15:36.280 --> 15:39.560]  have the only way I see them being able to launch their war on Iran which they're
[15:39.560 --> 15:45.120]  now trying to blame suitcase nukes on is a massive crisis we've already been
[15:45.120 --> 15:49.240]  lied to about fictitious WMDs in Iraq once now they're just coming back with
[15:49.240 --> 15:53.560]  the same story but I do see them staging terror I've seen them hyping that the
[15:53.560 --> 15:56.600]  tea parties are violent they've been caught planting people in there even in
[15:56.600 --> 16:02.400]  the AP now yesterday so everything I see them do is false flag setups frame-ups
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.760]  how do you see them getting us into a war which the rand corporation said two
[16:06.760 --> 16:12.040]  years ago they need to build their new world order well we believe it's the
[16:12.040 --> 16:19.000]  Iran is going to be the target the other one is there really may be a
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.320]  terror strike legitimately coming out of Pakistan this should be the major news
[16:26.320 --> 16:32.520]  every day virtually they're sending predator drones in and killing scores of
[16:32.520 --> 16:38.000]  innocent people I believe the numbers well over a thousand now in the last
[16:38.000 --> 16:45.000]  year it this is as old as the Old Testament it's an eye for an eye you
[16:45.000 --> 16:51.960]  have the greatest refugee crisis going on in Pakistan since Rwanda and they're
[16:51.960 --> 16:58.800]  escalating that war even more and of course the CIA is behind sending these
[16:58.800 --> 17:06.680]  drones in since when was the CIA supposed to be in the battle like this I
[17:06.680 --> 17:11.720]  thought they were only there to collect intelligence so we're really looking at
[17:11.720 --> 17:17.920]  something Alex where we have well over 200,000 Pakistanis in this country
[17:17.920 --> 17:24.000]  they're watching their families get murdered you think they're going to be
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.800]  angry they're going to say when terrorist strikes they hate our freedom and
[17:29.800 --> 17:34.960]  liberty how about they hate your foreign policy and they hate you for
[17:34.960 --> 17:40.400]  killing innocent people look what happened in Afghanistan two days ago
[17:40.400 --> 17:47.960]  they strafe the passenger bus there's plenty of hatred out there false flag
[17:47.960 --> 17:56.240]  or real we're forecasting in 2010 a 9-11 magnitude terrorist strike and we're
[17:56.240 --> 18:02.160]  saying this as well so people can take proactive measures what does it mean
[18:02.160 --> 18:06.480]  well it means the things that you're talking about with on your show the
[18:06.480 --> 18:12.120]  products the the survival products but it all and it means having gold to us but
[18:12.120 --> 18:19.080]  it also means what happened after 9-11 they shut the Wall Street down I couldn't
[18:19.080 --> 18:24.200]  cash in my CDs because I wanted to get away from here because Indian Point
[18:24.200 --> 18:30.400]  nuclear power plant is just north of 9-11 and I'm of ground zero and I'm just
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.480]  north of that so I went to get my CDs I couldn't get them out because Wall
[18:35.480 --> 18:40.840]  Street was closed their financial instruments this time when 9-11 magnitude
[18:40.840 --> 18:46.000]  terrorist strikes we forecast they're gonna close the banks you're not gonna
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.960]  be able to get your money out the end and there's gonna be cyber attacks as
[18:50.960 --> 18:55.360]  well and when you do get your money out the little bit they'll let you take out
[18:55.360 --> 19:01.760]  at a time it's gonna be devalued just like they devalued it under FDR when
[19:01.760 --> 19:06.560]  they called a bank holiday just like they devalued it in Argentina they'll
[19:06.560 --> 19:11.080]  devalued again that's one of the ways they're gonna try to get out of this
[19:11.080 --> 19:16.720]  financial mountain of debt that's bringing down the nation and just to
[19:16.720 --> 19:20.880]  back you up we see Citibank and the other big banks saying well hold your
[19:20.880 --> 19:25.600]  money for seven days we see Bloomberg federal regulators are ordering public
[19:25.600 --> 19:28.960]  and private pension funds since when can you do that in a free country to invest
[19:28.960 --> 19:32.240]  in failed banks that's a quote in fact print me the Bloomberg or business week
[19:32.240 --> 19:36.560]  again it actually says and now Argentina just took their pension funds
[19:36.560 --> 19:39.840]  Greece is talking about taking their pension funds they tried to take the
[19:39.840 --> 19:45.680]  Icelandic pension funds but the people rioted for a year and said no and so I
[19:45.680 --> 19:48.680]  mean this is incredible they're openly saying they're gonna take the pension
[19:48.680 --> 19:53.360]  funds the cyber security bill passed the house now in the Senate says for any
[19:53.360 --> 19:57.760]  emergency including financial the president can quote shut down the
[19:57.760 --> 20:02.120]  internet or selectively shut down the web we see internet censorship passed
[20:02.120 --> 20:07.200]  in Italy we see it passing in France we see it passing last week in England we
[20:07.200 --> 20:11.920]  see national publications main mainly singling me out saying I'm calling for
[20:11.920 --> 20:16.400]  violence what I'm not calling for censoring us I mean so clearly you
[20:16.400 --> 20:21.160]  can see them lining everything up and getting ready for a war as a political
[20:21.160 --> 20:25.800]  distraction but the real enemy is us fleecing us further and like a bully
[20:25.800 --> 20:31.920]  sitting on our chest pounding us in the face breaking our will so the criminal
[20:31.920 --> 20:36.880]  made-offs and Ken lay types that run our society they're trying to go for broke
[20:36.880 --> 20:41.360]  and then make sure they can protect themselves from the people exactly like
[20:41.360 --> 20:46.240]  I said these are nothing more than money junkies they can't get enough just like
[20:46.240 --> 20:51.840]  a heroin addict they have no bounds no boundaries no loyalties they'll do
[20:51.840 --> 20:57.040]  anything to get their money fix and that's what's going on now and then the
[20:57.040 --> 21:03.120]  other ones the politicians they need their power fix so it's a perfect group
[21:03.120 --> 21:09.080]  they're there they're the gang and they are destroying this nation and as we've
[21:09.080 --> 21:15.320]  said before people railing about old nationalism and socialism it's fascism
[21:15.320 --> 21:20.760]  the merger of state and corporate powers oh here's a beauty for you today you
[21:20.760 --> 21:28.080]  know this contest this private equity firm Syrabus they own Chrysler and they
[21:28.080 --> 21:34.920]  also own 51% of GMAC and this private equity group is seat the chairman and
[21:34.920 --> 21:45.040]  CEO is John Snow he was the Treasury Secretary before Hank Paulson on the
[21:45.040 --> 21:50.160]  Bush one of the board of directors is that brilliant shining light of
[21:50.160 --> 21:56.080]  intelligence and integrity Dan quail well today it was announced that
[21:56.080 --> 22:03.000]  Syrabus just bought Dinecorp you know those mercenaries those soldiers of the
[22:03.000 --> 22:10.440]  Fortune 500 those military contractors that's what's going on we bail out
[22:10.440 --> 22:17.560]  Chrysler we bail out GMAC and what do they do with that money they buy another
[22:17.560 --> 22:23.480]  piece of the war it's a racket just follow the names I've said this over and
[22:23.480 --> 22:28.560]  over and I'll say it again if the names on Wall Street were named Salenti
[22:28.560 --> 22:35.840]  Caruso Mondavi Puccini Rossini they call it the mafia but when you call it Dan
[22:35.840 --> 22:43.720]  quail in John Snow and Hank Paulson oh no it's just public servants and really
[22:43.720 --> 22:50.600]  really swell financial geniuses well Gerald Salenti I had Catherine Austin
[22:50.600 --> 22:56.600]  Fitz you know high-level former federal officer you know brilliant woman
[22:56.600 --> 23:02.160]  absolutely you know headed up HUD and when she discovered all of this and she
[23:02.160 --> 23:07.240]  was she said Alex you had a show on about CPS take people's kids and you
[23:07.240 --> 23:10.520]  didn't know and she sent us the documents in mainstream news articles I mean I
[23:10.520 --> 23:13.360]  don't know everything in fact I don't know much the more I learn the more I
[23:13.360 --> 23:18.000]  know how much I don't know I didn't know Dinecore its biggest business in the
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.440]  US is running CPS so the counties and cities stealing people's kids without
[23:23.440 --> 23:29.640]  due process and then selling them off literally to adoption agencies once I
[23:29.640 --> 23:33.240]  found out about it I Google search that there were thousands of articles Dinecore
[23:33.240 --> 23:37.880]  is now not just running white slavery rings as the Chicago Tribune reported a
[23:37.880 --> 23:43.080]  few years ago overseas in Serbia they're here running it so now these Pentagon
[23:43.080 --> 23:47.280]  groups are literally hunting us and our children and I didn't even know it
[23:47.280 --> 23:52.560]  think of what else I don't know and you know before we were talking about how
[23:52.560 --> 23:56.840]  they're clamping down on the little people with regulations or they just
[23:56.840 --> 24:02.960]  came out with the latest IRS reports and how they're not going after big
[24:02.960 --> 24:09.160]  corporations right they're going after the little people don't the people see
[24:09.160 --> 24:15.080]  what's going on over here they're going to crush the rebellion before it starts
[24:15.080 --> 24:20.280]  we're making it really clear we're calling for an intellectual revolution
[24:20.280 --> 24:25.920]  one of the mines not guns because you're not gonna outgun these guys and
[24:25.920 --> 24:30.880]  anybody that thinks they are they're out of their minds they'll crush you like
[24:30.880 --> 24:36.560]  a net we we want a revolution in this country before with mines we could win
[24:36.560 --> 24:41.400]  it again and it and that's what we're saying that can happen you know it's
[24:41.400 --> 24:48.840]  that 20% solution it's the people that will not follow the derange that wants
[24:48.840 --> 24:54.320]  to turn them into murderers to fight other wars that say no we're going to
[24:54.320 --> 25:00.480]  stop and if we stop these wars and we start concentrating and bringing the
[25:00.480 --> 25:07.400]  resources back to this country we can rebuild it step by step well I agree
[25:07.400 --> 25:11.560]  with you here it is failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks
[25:11.560 --> 25:15.680]  cash business week and this is now all over the news it was in the London
[25:15.680 --> 25:19.760]  Telegraph yesterday the federal deposit insurance core is trying to encourage
[25:19.760 --> 25:23.760]  public retirement funds that control more than two trillion to buy all are
[25:23.760 --> 25:28.440]  part of failed lenders so the big banks move their money out the back door and
[25:28.440 --> 25:32.440]  buy real assets then they put the public on the hook so all these cops and
[25:32.440 --> 25:36.160]  people being replaced by Dinecore now to snatch kids they're gonna take your
[25:36.160 --> 25:41.240]  pension funds and it goes on to say the government is ordering the pension funds
[25:41.240 --> 25:46.200]  to invest in failed banks since when in the land of the free home of the brave
[25:46.200 --> 25:51.960]  does the government regulators order the pension funds were to put their money
[25:51.960 --> 25:56.160]  well it's all selectively enforced I'm gonna back you up here if they don't the
[25:56.160 --> 26:00.280]  laws millions of laws there's millions are written where nobody can follow the
[26:00.280 --> 26:03.520]  law it's all selectively enforced so they'll go in and shut them down that's
[26:03.520 --> 26:06.960]  what Catherine Austin Fitz said and agreed with me here last week but then
[26:06.960 --> 26:11.200]  you talked about the articles in the Wall Street Journal in New York Times in
[26:11.200 --> 26:17.200]  the last year that I've seen where not only have they cut almost all of the
[26:17.200 --> 26:22.920]  white-collar investigators off of big banks big corporations that pay almost
[26:22.920 --> 26:27.400]  no tax it's reported but when they do bust a Swiss bank account and make it big
[26:27.400 --> 26:31.240]  news and Reuters today it was for two hundred thousand dollars so they're
[26:31.240 --> 26:35.800]  busting little bitty chump level that sounds a lot to a McDonald's worker but
[26:35.800 --> 26:39.000]  that's nothing you know to the elite who are in the trillions and hundreds of
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.840]  billions individually in some cases and then I remember reading articles about
[26:42.840 --> 26:45.840]  now they're not even having them go after upper middle class it's after blue
[26:45.840 --> 26:50.400]  collar people thirty five thousand and and and that they send two uniformed
[26:50.400 --> 26:55.680]  officers of Sacramento to a guy's car wash that hadn't paid four cents back
[26:55.680 --> 27:00.680]  pull that up was two or four cents Sacramento B car wash visit over two
[27:00.680 --> 27:05.280]  cents and they threatened him over two cents again they've got the few
[27:05.280 --> 27:09.320]  investigators going after people for two cents well the same thing here in New
[27:09.320 --> 27:14.520]  York they're busting people to go into beauty parlors to get all the sales tax
[27:14.520 --> 27:19.480]  they can little cafe owners they're cracking down on the little people and
[27:19.480 --> 27:24.080]  they have the goons squads behind them there's a lot of things going on right
[27:24.080 --> 27:28.000]  now that people should be watching around the world and and one of them of
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.680]  course is Greece this is just the beginning we could actually see the
[27:31.680 --> 27:36.400]  breakup of the economic the European Monetary Union there's gonna be people
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.200]  there's gonna be countries that aren't gonna be able to cut it but also look
[27:40.200 --> 27:45.200]  at the riots going on in Thailand look what's going on in Krzegestan look
[27:45.200 --> 27:50.960]  what's going on in Latvia Lithuania the Ukraine we're going to see the seeds of
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.480]  war are already fermenting they're blossoming they're coming up from the
[27:55.480 --> 27:59.800]  ground look what happened in Hungary again people should really take a
[27:59.800 --> 28:05.040]  global view they just brought in of they just brought in a very right wing
[28:05.040 --> 28:12.320]  government and the the neo-nazi party they just got almost 20% of the vote so
[28:12.320 --> 28:17.320]  we're going to start seeing some real backlashes going on and and the other
[28:17.320 --> 28:22.240]  thing that we're we're forecasting is that when the stimulus money runs out
[28:22.240 --> 28:27.080]  the crash is going to happen and we believe it's going to be a currency
[28:27.080 --> 28:32.120]  crash and again look what's going on in Europe and and and they're covering it
[28:32.120 --> 28:36.880]  up they it's really it's much worse than they're making it seem even with Greece
[28:36.880 --> 28:43.720]  and you go back to December of of 09 a couple of months ago they said oh don't
[28:43.720 --> 28:48.440]  worry about it the Greece problem is not going to be a big one we can take care
[28:48.440 --> 28:52.560]  of it well they just broke the rules they said they would never under the
[28:52.560 --> 28:58.800]  master agreement bail out a failed country and now they're doing it so the
[28:58.800 --> 29:05.800]  entire systems are failing and people better plan for the worst and and a
[29:05.800 --> 29:09.480]  correction their CBS news will throw it back up on screen
[29:09.480 --> 29:15.160]  Sacramento car wash gets IRS visit over four cents I was going for memory I'm
[29:15.160 --> 29:21.080]  sorry it was over a lot more money it was four cents imagine sending the IRS to
[29:21.080 --> 29:25.640]  threaten someone over four cents what are these IRS agents thinking they can't
[29:25.640 --> 29:29.560]  go after Bernie Madoff but they can go after somebody with four cents well
[29:29.560 --> 29:34.680]  again that's the whole system it's the cops crashing down look if you have two
[29:34.680 --> 29:39.760]  glasses of wine and they stop you they'll throw you against the car in hand
[29:39.760 --> 29:46.200]  cup you and send you to jail I mean come on it's squeezed the little people this
[29:46.200 --> 29:52.560]  is classic when an empire is in decline and America is that declining empire so
[29:52.560 --> 29:56.920]  that's what happens and that's why revolts begin as you said they have the
[29:56.920 --> 30:00.880]  agents provocateur that they keep putting in whether it's a peaceful
[30:00.880 --> 30:05.400]  demonstration and all of a sudden you see a squad of guys coming out and they
[30:05.400 --> 30:10.960]  call an anarchist with masks on and who are they they're the police and they're
[30:10.960 --> 30:14.880]  making it look as though it's the the average person that's causing the
[30:14.880 --> 30:19.560]  damage and the same thing as you pointed out the infiltrators of these tea
[30:19.560 --> 30:24.760]  parties so we're really in a very crucial time right now and we could go
[30:24.760 --> 30:31.720]  either way but the unquestionably after the stimulus high runs out the economy
[30:31.720 --> 30:37.800]  is going to crash they're gonna try to keep it alive for the 2010 midterm
[30:37.800 --> 30:42.600]  elections but after that it's going to it's going to fall apart but we're
[30:42.600 --> 30:47.240]  forecasting actually it may happen even before then you're saying before the
[30:47.240 --> 30:51.960]  10th 2010 stay there we're gonna come back get into your forecast on the
[30:51.960 --> 30:55.360]  economy and then take phone calls a whole nother hour a journal Selente

[34:31.640 --> 34:36.480]  said this is racketeering you try to go to peaceful political protest and make
[34:36.480 --> 34:40.080]  them look like cooks or make them look like racist as other groups are saying
[34:40.080 --> 34:43.560]  they're gonna do or try to cause violence as other groups are saying
[34:43.560 --> 34:49.480]  that's racketeering that's organized crime getting together to go set people
[34:49.480 --> 34:53.920]  up and the black congressional caucus walked out in the tea party tried to get
[34:53.920 --> 34:57.920]  them to spit on them try to get them to call in the n-word nobody did that the
[34:57.920 --> 35:02.240]  media ran with it and lied this is the type of propaganda we're talking about
[35:02.240 --> 35:05.560]  Gerald Salente is our guest your calls coming up right when we start the next

[35:24.800 --> 35:31.520]  Gerald talking about the economy going under a I know you can't put an exact
[35:31.520 --> 35:36.880]  date on it but a danger zone a b is there a way to stop it and see when they
[35:36.880 --> 35:41.400]  implode it what type of things are they gonna try to steal that the timing is
[35:41.400 --> 35:45.680]  very tough but we're we were looking for something really to happen between now
[35:45.680 --> 35:51.040]  and and September that that's our that's our window because you're gonna start
[35:51.040 --> 35:55.160]  seeing a lot more commercial real estate collapsing you're gonna start seeing
[35:55.160 --> 35:58.960]  more sovereign debt problems and they're not gonna be able to cover it up
[35:58.960 --> 36:05.040]  anymore and of course the Fed is winding back on their on their 1.5
[36:05.040 --> 36:10.000]  trillion that they're covering this whole housing bubble with and and that's
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.840]  winding down as well so we're gonna start seeing some very bad sales coming out
[36:14.840 --> 36:20.720]  in real estate as well the how can it be stopped it can be stopped only a
[36:20.720 --> 36:26.680]  couple of ways one is that we have to start doing business with each other
[36:26.680 --> 36:32.480]  we're a country of over 300 million people by American we have to and I'm
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.400]  not a protectionist and I'm certainly not an isolationist I travel the world
[36:37.400 --> 36:42.440]  but I also have to support my neighbor and my neighbors support me because of
[36:42.440 --> 36:48.040]  neither of us do good we all do bad and that's the way really to as we can see
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.680]  it coming back in is to rebuild this country brick by brick manufacturing by
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.600]  manufacturer it was wonderful to hear about that jeans company made in
[36:58.600 --> 37:04.560]  America anybody that's looking to get into business and to make a mark sell
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.920]  made in America the country's yearning for it really wants it number two in how
[37:09.920 --> 37:15.120]  to bring it back is we need a productive capacity as well and the best way we see
[37:15.120 --> 37:20.480]  it is with an alternative energy but not win solar geothermal a biofuel
[37:20.480 --> 37:25.640]  something much bigger and this isn't hyperbole go back to when we went in
[37:25.640 --> 37:31.040]  1990s and we were in a very severe recession when Clinton got elected under
[37:31.040 --> 37:36.760]  the mantra it's the economy stupid what got us out the internet revolution
[37:36.760 --> 37:41.960]  products were invented design manufactured marketed service we need
[37:41.960 --> 37:47.800]  that with a new energy product and and and by the way a magazine I don't have
[37:47.800 --> 37:53.320]  the mentality for it but for those that do have engineering experience infinite
[37:53.320 --> 37:59.080]  energy they're on the cutting edge with coal fusion zero point energy charge
[37:59.080 --> 38:04.600]  clusters permanent magnets something like that Alex you can't print your way
[38:04.600 --> 38:10.960]  out of this you can't you can't spend out of it just like you or I if we're
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.520]  deep in debt we don't borrow more money you can only innovate you've got to
[38:16.520 --> 38:22.920]  innovate out of it exactly when we come back I want to briefly well we're gonna
[38:22.920 --> 38:25.740]  take calls and I'm gonna ask you about NASA and I'm not for spending ten
[38:25.740 --> 38:30.000]  billion dollars a year on NASA but if you're gonna give trillions of the banks
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.120]  over a trillion bucks to the war every year we can't have ten billion for NASA
[38:35.120 --> 38:39.560]  again everything's got to go to the war machine and the banks it's killing
[38:39.560 --> 38:46.760]  America we'll be back in one minute thank you for listening to GCN be sure to

[39:28.080 --> 39:32.640]  fight for your freedom and your life how much will you need we don't know how
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.160]  much do you want all you can get I'm Alex Jones I want all of you good guys to
[39:37.160 --> 39:44.280]  live to fight another day call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at
[39:44.280 --> 40:01.280]  eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633. Waging War on Corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[40:06.280 --> 40:10.280]  This just went up on the drugs report. What have I been saying the last three days?
[40:10.280 --> 40:15.760]  Critics Obama administration hyping terrorist attack nuclear terror attack
[40:15.760 --> 40:20.720]  U.S. officials say the claim is not based on new intelligence it is made up
[40:20.720 --> 40:26.840]  just like when Bush put it out okay now there could be some real terror attacks
[40:26.840 --> 40:31.480]  that's somebody fighting back like Pakistan or if we attack Iran they've
[40:31.480 --> 40:36.640]  said we're gonna attack back but Gerald Solente I'm no fan of Iran I'm America
[40:36.640 --> 40:41.080]  first but it's not America it's banks and corporations leading us into these
[40:41.080 --> 40:45.280]  wars that are black holes they steal money out of if they use as political
[40:45.280 --> 40:51.320]  distractions I mean if our country attacks Iran I mean what do people expect
[40:51.320 --> 40:55.840]  Iran to do I mean to lay there and take it I mean since when do you I mean it
[40:55.840 --> 41:01.520]  be like Nazi Germany attacking England and England not fighting back or it'd
[41:01.520 --> 41:09.880]  be like you know it's just so asinine Gerald yes it is and again let's look
[41:09.880 --> 41:14.000]  at the history of Iran first of all these are the Persians they're not going
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.560]  anywhere there are 75 million of them and you know what have they really done I
[41:19.560 --> 41:24.760]  don't think that in the last century they haven't colonized anybody they didn't
[41:24.760 --> 41:30.080]  attack another invade another country I mean when you look at the people that
[41:30.080 --> 41:36.240]  are pointing the fingers at Iran particularly the United States Branson
[41:36.240 --> 41:42.320]  Israel you know their track record of colonization starting wars invading
[41:42.320 --> 41:47.640]  countries and occupying them is a lot worse than Iran's is so why all of a
[41:47.640 --> 41:54.120]  sudden Iran and what if they do get a nuclear weapon well what are they gonna
[41:54.120 --> 41:58.160]  do with it they're gonna attack somebody with it everyone knows that if they
[41:58.160 --> 42:04.760]  used it they'd be annihilated so this is really to get the people angry we need
[42:04.760 --> 42:10.280]  communism is gone the Germans you know where they during World War two is long
[42:10.280 --> 42:15.960]  over the Japanese we don't have any more to point fingers at and now they're
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.360]  looking at the Iranians and North Koreans so what when we're talking by the way of
[42:21.360 --> 42:27.320]  a what's gonna bring the economy down if we have a terrorist strike this
[42:27.320 --> 42:33.920]  economy goes to zero we go down an economic dark hole that will never be
[42:33.920 --> 42:40.480]  able to pull out of because go back to 9-11 we were in a recession right after
[42:40.480 --> 42:48.520]  9-11 Alan the genius Greenspan who admits he's wrong 30% of the time a sea
[42:48.520 --> 42:55.880]  average he began to lower interest rates to 46 year lows we can't do that anymore
[42:55.880 --> 43:02.400]  to juice the economy if there's a terror strike we see an economic terror
[43:02.400 --> 43:07.400]  that will drive this country into the greatest depression a lot faster than
[43:07.400 --> 43:11.760]  we're forecasting but the banks will love that because they're waging war against
[43:11.760 --> 43:15.160]  Main Street they love things falling apart they get deposed as a savior and
[43:15.160 --> 43:19.720]  consolidate society well the banks of the banks you know that they're going to
[43:19.720 --> 43:24.320]  make money anyway they can and we don't have to worry about them going
[43:24.320 --> 43:28.760]  anywhere because when we get into trouble you know we bail them out and
[43:28.760 --> 43:35.440]  again go back to the quotes of Smedley Butler and and others who know that who
[43:35.440 --> 43:40.680]  knew the deal and knew what this whole thing is about it's about people making
[43:40.680 --> 43:45.200]  a lot of money and doing dirty deals and the banks are the ones that wash the
[43:45.200 --> 43:50.760]  money absolutely and that's why Reuters even admits Russia said okay kill with
[43:50.760 --> 43:56.360]  poppy fields it's up over 12 12 times what it was and nine years ago and the
[43:56.360 --> 44:00.160]  US and NATO said no we're gonna let them grow and sell the opium I mean it's
[44:00.160 --> 44:03.680]  out in the open but then cops will raise your house looking for a marijuana
[44:03.680 --> 44:06.560]  cigarette we're going directly to your calls when we come back and play a

[48:42.520 --> 48:47.440]  become accustomed to the idea that every now and then something is going to

[51:08.600 --> 51:14.040]  now go ahead and go to some phone calls let's talk to trip in Florida who's been
[51:14.040 --> 51:17.440]  holding patiently you're on the air with the number one trends forecaster of
[51:17.440 --> 51:23.200]  trends research comm Gerald Salente hey Alex and Gerald how y'all we're all
[51:23.200 --> 51:30.400]  right all right I was wondering about China's involvement in all this I saw
[51:30.400 --> 51:36.320]  mainstream media yesterday that China was going to back us up in this whole
[51:36.320 --> 51:42.760]  Iran business so that kind of makes me nervous yeah how does China play into
[51:42.760 --> 51:48.600]  the big picture economically militarily everything well China is going to only
[51:48.600 --> 51:52.400]  going to go so far with Iran because they're doing a lot of business with
[51:52.400 --> 51:58.600]  them and China is holding all the cards they're holding all our debt so we
[51:58.600 --> 52:03.720]  really have to play the China game not the other way around and that's what
[52:03.720 --> 52:09.520]  we're really looking at all this noise by the way about letting the Yuan float so
[52:09.520 --> 52:15.160]  that American exports can can be more competitive meaning that it is going to
[52:15.160 --> 52:20.080]  cause more to buy Chinese products that's only for public consumption you
[52:20.080 --> 52:26.440]  know if China is producing stuff it at slave labor wages if they're if their
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.960]  currency goes up a little bit it's not like everybody's going to be buying US
[52:30.960 --> 52:36.200]  products so China is really the ace in the hole over here because if the other
[52:36.200 --> 52:42.520]  problem with China is last year for example they had seventy thousand seventy
[52:42.520 --> 52:48.120]  thousand major disturbances and riots if the Chinese economy doesn't keep
[52:48.120 --> 52:53.680]  parking along they have 1.2 billion problems on their hands and let's not
[52:53.680 --> 53:00.200]  forget this one of the only reasons why this economy didn't crash worse than it
[53:00.200 --> 53:05.920]  has and quicker than it has is because China has been throwing trillions of
[53:05.920 --> 53:12.280]  dollars into pumping up their economy and by extension the world economy so now
[53:12.280 --> 53:17.360]  when China as they're doing now starts to wind back the economy starts to slow
[53:17.360 --> 53:22.520]  up because we don't have a real economy we have a parasite banking economy of
[53:22.520 --> 53:27.680]  global banking dictatorship and now we have no more denial about world
[53:27.680 --> 53:31.160]  government we have Gordon Brown Obama saying we're gonna have a planetary
[53:31.160 --> 53:36.600]  regime with carbon taxes paid to private banks under a global Constitution
[53:36.600 --> 53:41.480]  where the banks will be the government I mean this is moving faster than I even
[53:41.480 --> 53:44.760]  thought it would I don't see how they're gonna get away with this open
[53:44.760 --> 53:50.000]  tyranny Gerald but they're getting away with it now and again we've said this
[53:50.000 --> 53:56.120]  over and over again the merger of state and corporate powers is fascism and
[53:56.120 --> 54:01.640]  what happens when you live under a fascist dictator you don't get out of
[54:01.640 --> 54:08.240]  line anything else sorry go ahead no and that's what they're doing now anything
[54:08.240 --> 54:14.280]  else trip police state for absolutely thank you thank you I appreciate the call
[54:14.280 --> 54:19.600]  trip Justin in West Virginia you're on the air go ahead yeah hey guys are you
[54:19.600 --> 54:24.720]  doing all right go ahead sir I just wanted to read a couple sentences from
[54:24.720 --> 54:28.200]  a story that someone wrote about the health bill and then I was gonna ask
[54:28.200 --> 54:33.480]  the question to Gerald that's one of my later questions is the health care bill
[54:33.480 --> 54:38.880]  his analysis of it but but go ahead and read your your point he put in their
[54:38.880 --> 54:42.960]  insurance companies can no longer drop clients you become sick giving them
[54:42.960 --> 54:48.400]  lifetime coverage pre-existing medical conditions people will still be
[54:48.400 --> 54:54.680]  available and at the end he said by expectancy will be sure to go up and it
[54:54.680 --> 55:00.240]  will help make the economy better by having less people file for bankruptcy
[55:00.240 --> 55:05.960]  and my question was is what does Gerald think about how the health bill is gonna
[55:05.960 --> 55:10.440]  fit in with the crash that you predicts is coming up Gerald give us your
[55:10.440 --> 55:14.040]  breakdown of the health care bill well the health care bill is not gonna
[55:14.040 --> 55:18.080]  accelerate the crash that's a minor player in it although it's a big one
[55:18.080 --> 55:23.240]  that's a health care bill again another example of fascism we're being forced to
[55:23.240 --> 55:28.920]  buy insurance from criminal insurance companies how could you make this stuff
[55:28.920 --> 55:33.920]  up and what is it going to do perpetuate a failing system look at the
[55:33.920 --> 55:38.440]  condition of the American people what are we doing we're gonna be dumping more
[55:38.440 --> 55:42.880]  money into a system whereby the people are in very bad shape themselves not
[55:42.880 --> 55:47.600]  taking care of themselves they're addicted to drugs turned on the television I
[55:47.600 --> 55:53.520]  love it what is this fibromyalgia one of them I'm watching you know I guess that
[55:53.520 --> 55:59.280]  replaced Epstein-Bart disease they keep making up these things so people become
[55:59.280 --> 56:04.120]  hypochondriacs and then they have a disclaimer you can't make this stuff up
[56:04.120 --> 56:11.880]  a side effect is suicide so all this is is a system to keep the people in
[56:11.880 --> 56:16.360]  control to make them think that they're doing something for them and they're
[56:16.360 --> 56:22.360]  robbing us they're taxing us to take our money to give it to the insurance
[56:22.360 --> 56:28.280]  companies it again you could not make this up it's fascism absolutely let me
[56:28.280 --> 56:31.400]  give you my take on it which mirrors what Gerald is saying and then a good
[56:31.400 --> 56:38.440]  good points Justin there's a war going on of lies and truth and all I have is my
[56:38.440 --> 56:43.640]  honor all I have is that I sleep well at night I tell the truth I do hardcore
[56:43.640 --> 56:47.960]  research my predictions have come true Gerald's unfortunately have come true
[56:47.960 --> 56:53.360]  we're political atheists I love that term he uses I know I'm not a Republican
[56:53.360 --> 56:57.800]  Democrat I'm a freedom lover I'm a truth teller I have read the five
[56:57.800 --> 57:00.280]  different versions of the bill in the past bill I've scanned over the key
[57:00.280 --> 57:04.480]  sections I've had congressman on I've read it and then after the fact they
[57:04.480 --> 57:08.560]  admitted it no one's getting free health care it doesn't cover pre-existing
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.640]  conditions in fact pull up the AP it says what was the headline of the exact
[57:13.640 --> 57:21.640]  headline it was oversight in bill like it was a mistake oh didn't give you
[57:21.640 --> 57:25.520]  coverage it makes 30 plus million people buy coverage it lets the insurance
[57:25.520 --> 57:30.160]  companies lower the standard it allows them to raise premiums they're saying
[57:30.160 --> 57:36.040]  over 32% right now 39% on average in California that's AP today I covered it
[57:36.040 --> 57:42.600]  in the first hour 39% it makes you get it you've seen the VA run health care but
[57:42.600 --> 57:46.680]  this isn't government health care as Ron Paul said it's corporate health care
[57:46.680 --> 57:51.400]  it's the government though dictating what doctors can do and what they can't do
[57:51.400 --> 57:56.200]  Gerald Solente oh you hit it you covered all the points let's take another
[57:56.200 --> 58:03.360]  call here but there's that other one too what is that that army of doctors that
[58:03.360 --> 58:10.240]  they're now putting together there another military wing that's allowed to
[58:10.240 --> 58:15.880]  really become a militia a government militia of doctors that they're also
[58:15.880 --> 58:20.200]  having that bill and they say federally they've got to report parents to CPS and
[58:20.200 --> 58:24.400]  ask the kids questions but the the point I forgot to make is it's a war of truth
[58:24.400 --> 58:29.200]  and lies I was watching hardball two nights ago and everything coming out of
[58:29.200 --> 58:33.600]  Matthew's mouth was a lie that's why the guys got 400,000 viewers folks this
[58:33.600 --> 58:39.680]  radio show conservatively has double that every day this guy's a joke no one is
[58:39.680 --> 58:46.160]  watching Anderson Cooper and no one is watching these people on CNN MSNBC
[58:46.160 --> 58:50.160]  CNN's lost more than half its ratings in the last year because people are
[58:50.160 --> 58:54.680]  getting wise to him but Gerald I still can't believe him saying there's no
[58:54.680 --> 58:59.880]  rationing there's no death panels when it does have the bioethics panels Tom
[58:59.880 --> 59:04.760]  Dashel said we will cut care to the old people I mean don't they know the public
[59:04.760 --> 59:09.200]  gonna find out they're lying I mean it's just such a lying your hacks I mean
[59:09.200 --> 59:13.160]  let's face it look who they represent look where they come from by their deeds
[59:13.160 --> 59:17.480]  you shall know them you go through the whole list of these guys these TV tough
[59:17.480 --> 59:21.720]  guys these big mouths and they did this playing to the crowd and they and he's
[59:21.720 --> 59:25.920]  you know he's one of the crowd I want to come back and take some more calls but
[59:25.920 --> 59:28.560]  we come back I first want to ask Gerald Salente because I'm interested in his
[59:28.560 --> 59:32.760]  take Time Magazine Newsweek I'll ask the question I'll get the answer when we
[59:32.760 --> 59:36.960]  come back Time Magazine London Guardian Newsweek Southern Poverty Law Center

[59:42.440 --> 59:47.480]  violence and I'm dangerous why are they singling me out more really than
[59:47.480 --> 59:51.800]  anybody else now on a daily basis what does Gerald think that is really all
[59:51.800 --> 59:54.840]  about because I really want to get his take on it I want to ask him if he's
[59:54.840 --> 59:58.520]  had any threats or demonization out there as well then we're going right back

[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.440]  continuing with your phone calls with Gerald Salente and his extended two hour
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.440]  interview we've got about 35 minutes left with him today
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.120]  top trends forecaster Gerald again I'm selfishly asking you the question but
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:35.480]  also it lets us understand politically what they're concerned about I'm not in
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.840]  the left-right paradigm I'm a political atheist like yourself I'm a
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:43.120]  constitutionalist they're trying to demonize the tea party anybody that
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:47.640]  criticizes the banks three years ago you predicted there'd be these grassroots
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.200]  protests and rebellions against taxation against the banks that's now
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.120]  unfolding why do you think they're singling me out particularly I mean if
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.480]  a cop gets shot they say it's my fault with no evidence why do you think we're
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.760]  a year into this program of demonization because you're making a
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:10.480]  difference and you're waking people up and you're speaking to what a lot of
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:17.040]  people feel and they don't want that to happen so it's it's it's logical that
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.000]  they would do that they wanted they want to stop the force that has the most
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.920]  power and it's you know it's like cutting off the head of a snake they they
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.840]  feel as though if they can stop you they could stop the movement in a lot of
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.120]  ways because you're at the forefront of it and they're going to continue to do
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:39.960]  it and demonize everybody and that they can that exposes the fraud going on I
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:46.440]  remember talking about what was going on about how this this DC ice we called it
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.360]  Wall Street hijacks Washington how when we first said that we look at it was
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:55.680]  considered outrageous that we would think that so anytime that you begin to
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:01.000]  expose the fraud the criminality and the corruption they want to shut you down
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.800]  because you caused them a lot of money and a lot of problems but why would all
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.480]  these major TV networks and publications say I'm calling for violence and Fox
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.800]  admitted in a news article to they wrote they called Homeland Security on us
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.640]  I don't know if you knew this two weeks ago off comments on the message board
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.600]  implying that they were ours then we found far worse comments on Fox Nations
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.640]  own website their own pundits even saying more do you think they're getting
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:30.640]  ready to set me up or is this just to demonize me I mean because it looks
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.360]  like they're trying to sick the cops and the IRS on me well they're probably
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.600]  well aware of that already and they're just going to look for any kind of
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.920]  breach that they could give an excuse to come in with just like they do with
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:48.400]  everyone else so it's again you know you said it before you know the only thing
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.000]  you have in this life is your word and your dignity and that's all you leave
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.760]  behind is your word so of course there's always the threat I mean I I have to tell
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:05.200]  you back in in 2002 in the trends journal in my column I wrote it's getting
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.640]  dangerous and I said that I'm going to be careful what I say because when they
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.520]  come out from the government saying and you remember during the Bush years you're
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:20.560]  either with us or against us and you have to be careful what you say and we're
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:25.440]  entering into a period like that and I make this really clear I'm not willing
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:31.080]  to die for my country because what is my country my country certainly isn't the
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:36.440]  Democrats or the Republicans so what do you when do you know you know when do
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:41.560]  you say hey listen you know do knock yourself out do what you want to do but
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.880]  I'm not going to take shots for anybody I make that really clear and I make it
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:50.560]  very clear that we're calling for an intellectual revolution so what I would
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:56.120]  suggest you continue to do every chance you can is to say we want a peaceful
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:02.120]  change and what and you see here's that we is what's going on Alex the more
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.080]  they lose control the harder they're gonna clamp down and this is what the
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:12.040]  people need to know and that's why we're saying the more that they start losing
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:18.400]  the more control that slips away they're going to create a violent situation so
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.600]  they could crack down on it and do you agree that they're clearly trying to
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.120]  provocateur well they've been caught violence and that they want to they
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.160]  wanted to get violent I don't know if they want to but I know that nothing I
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.480]  read my lips no new taxes I didn't have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky I
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.200]  smoked but I didn't inhale Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:43.000]  I'm no crook how can anybody believe anything they say that we remember the
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.720]  main the golf of Tonkin one lie built after another these are psychopaths and
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:54.440]  sociopaths look at this guy this this what there was Edwards John Edwards
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:59.400]  whiter than white you know talking about morality and he gets caught with a

[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:11.200]  of a sociopath this is who they are and this is the way they behave they will do
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:17.000]  anything to maintain their control they act with all of the respectability and
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.640]  dignity on the teller on on in front of the folks and behind the scenes they're
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:28.440]  doing it dirty little stuff and again and they're not even man enough to admit
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:33.960]  it whoever made up this stuff as soon as you get caught out in sex your promise
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:40.920]  you're gonna go the sex addiction therapy whether they make this
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:47.640]  yeah well and exactly the media makes it a big deal about sex with women as they

[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:24.080]  some other questions I want to ask him in some Twitter questions as well let's
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.960]  go ahead and talk to Ron in Texas Ron you're on the air go ahead
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.480]  now that's always a pleasure Mr. Salente is a complete honor I got two
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:39.800]  questions actually one there was a 2005 PNAC report by Gary Schmidt that
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:46.200]  started off saying that Iran's nuclear capability was about 10 years behind so
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:53.280]  my first question is what do you see in your professional opinion as a reality
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:14:03.320]  of their capability the other one is some time ago we had a warhead that was
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:09.880]  known as the whiskey 54 which was nicknamed a Davey Crockett and a
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:16.200]  special atomic demolition munition that was man-portable a reason why I'm
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.240]  stating this is this yielded somewhere between one and ten kilotons so would
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:27.360]  you say that they would go more if they played this card go more route of a
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:34.200]  kiloton yield or things how the megaton to be too destructive and kind of I
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:40.440]  guess be worthless to what they wanted to end up with all right thank you Ron
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.680]  let's get Gerald Salente's take on that question we believe that Iran is
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.960]  eventually gonna have nuclear weapons I guess you can bring it down to the right
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:54.440]  to bear arms they're in a very hostile region they have hostile neighbors and
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:59.640]  and it's probably going to be for defensive purposes look India has them
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:05.240]  Pakistan has them both of them have not signed a nuclear proliferation treaty as
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:10.480]  has Israel hasn't signed it either so we believe at some point they're going to
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.920]  get it to use it as a whole another thing it's like being armed and not going
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.640]  to war as to the defensive purposes and we would say it logically we believe
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:26.760]  that Iran is going to move to a nuclear and there's no stopping them and again
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:32.960]  on the one province do you do that when does the hypocrisy stop why could the
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:39.920]  UK why can France why can India why can China why can Israel and why can the
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:45.240]  United States have nuclear weapons and Russia and not Iran well look at North
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.320]  Korea as soon as you get a nuclear loan yeah I mean you know are they going to
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.280]  use them if they use them they're gonna suffer the consequences are they gonna
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:59.320]  use them against Russia and China they can wipe down like a net even if they use
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:05.960]  them against Israel the firepower coming back would be multiples way beyond so and
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.120]  then again who in their right mind would use a nuclear weapon well then they say
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:14.360]  oh they're crazy Muslims but but but I mean looking at that Iran's nuclear
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.200]  program is public the centrifuge is won't make the uranium they need they've
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.200]  been offered to have France make it so everybody knew that it wasn't able to do
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:26.160]  that I mean I I mean Venezuela wants nuclear reactors now they are having
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:31.240]  power outages I mean South Africa's got nukes our government is overthrown Iran
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:37.040]  twice I mean it's just incredible I know and that's what we're saying but what
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:43.200]  they're doing is they're using Iran as the symbol for people to hate and once
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.360]  you get the people to hate then they can prosecute their war and they won't
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:52.240]  hate the bankers now that is a real problem of course the bankers will be
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.680]  forgotten because that's what we were saying in the beginning this is the
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:03.520]  same scenario different names different places it's 1929 it's it's the Great
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:09.600]  Depression and it's World War two well it's the Panic of 08 we're gonna go
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.600]  into the Great Depression we're already in it look how many people have it
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.160]  don't have jobs you know the numbers what's the effect of unemployment rate
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:22.360]  around 20% you know so and now they're gonna the way they're going to get us
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:26.200]  out of it when all their other schemes fail is they're going to take us to war
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:32.040]  they're taking us to war in Pakistan look what's going on over there we're in
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:37.680]  Pakistan we're in a we're in Afghanistan we're in Iraq and we're
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:44.640]  going to go we're fearful of fighting a war with Iran absolutely let's go
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.440]  ahead and talk to Scott in Texas you're on the air then Pamela Jim Paul and
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:56.360]  others hi Gerald hi Alex hi Gerald I've got two questions for you today one to
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:01.200]  do with the coming war that y'all are predicting and the the other one is
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:07.760]  trying to forecast exactly when the collapse will happen again the collapsing
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.920]  timings it's very difficult for the timing because they come up with
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:15.760]  screen schemes undreamed of what you're saying as early as September of this
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.440]  year we believe that we can have it by September because again they will who
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:24.080]  would have thought we were been bailing out banks and buying up companies so it
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:27.560]  should have gone down and then they do all these things behind his scenes that
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.160]  we don't know about but we're believed by and then the other issue I'm sorry the
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:37.840]  other question was war what do you see that happening again you know that the
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.960]  timing is very difficult but we believe it's it's it's going to be sooner rather
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.240]  than later and it's going to be steps into the great war they're not it's not
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:52.680]  gonna be one day but it can be one day if there is a 9-11 magnitude terrorist
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.680]  strike which we believe is going to happen so you have all these different
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:01.400]  factors going on at one time which one's going to be the tripping point it's
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:09.760]  very difficult to say at this point Scott does I answer your question I just
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.560]  want to ask one quick thing about the war part
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:20.440]  Hugh court has a website where he calls that the bin Laden has plans for an
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:26.560]  American Hiroshima I wonder if Gerald is familiar with what's available three
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.520]  dr. court and if he would have any you know does he put much credibility into
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:36.720]  that I've been hearing from bin Laden now for how many years you know and and I
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.520]  don't think he has the wherewithal even if he's even there there is a bin Laden
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.320]  anymore Scott I appreciate your call let me comment on that look we know Alcada
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:50.920]  was created by the CIA we know bin Laden was CIA we know that every week or two
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:56.080]  there's a new article quoting him from some message board or audio and at the
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.640]  bottom it says we don't know if this is him or not this is a boogeyman a gold
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.440]  steam somebody to scare the population here's the Washington Times critics
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:09.040]  Obama administration hyping terrorist nuclear risk the Obama administration is
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.880]  warning the danger of a terror attack within the United States the nuclear
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:17.760]  weapon is increasing but US officials say the claim is not based on new
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:22.000]  intelligence and questioned whether the threat is being overstated and President
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.080]  Obama went on in the 47 you know nation nuclear summit they were having to
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.840]  conclude that the risk of nuclear confrontation has gone down between
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:36.240]  nations but the risk of nuclear attack from terrorist has gone up I mean this
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.960]  and then it's got all these top analysts saying this is political hype and fear
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:46.240]  mongering and Obama's trying to blame it on Iran when Iran is Shiite the arch
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:51.560]  enemy of the Saudi Arabian Al Qaeda Wahhabi is comments on that Gerald you
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.560]  covered it it is hype and and it could happen by the way you know when I wrote
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:02.600]  trends 2000 back in 1996 we front-loaded it with the breakup of the former Soviet
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:07.920]  Union and all of the suitcase size nukes and other nuclear materials that were
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:13.000]  being sold on the black market so again it with the foreign policy going in the
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.640]  direction it's going in of course there's going to be major reprisals against
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:22.120]  the United States anybody that thinks differently is out of their mind you
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:26.640]  can't invade other countries occupy him kill hundreds of thousands of people and
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:31.640]  not want people to get even with you how they do it whether it's nuclear a
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:37.320]  biological attack whether it's a you know whatever it might be in a stadium in
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.840]  a shopping mall it's going to happen Gerald when I'm saying is it is in this
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:49.080]  inverted logic terrorism will help the New World Order it will help the fascists
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:53.280]  the corporatists because the public doesn't understand we're attacking other
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:58.320]  people you know if a cop breaks his baton on your head he charges you this
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:02.640]  literally happens with assaulting him now there's a big federal case of course
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:09.440]  with Maryland University over this right now and so it really helps the
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:13.760]  establishment to stage terror attacks as a pretext to launch these new wars
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:21.960]  Alex you know you don't need any clearer proof than Afghanistan and Iraq Iraq is
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:28.120]  a war being fought on the false pretenses there was no weapons of mass
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:34.160]  destruction there was no ties to Al Qaeda and go back and look at what the
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:42.160]  reasoning was to attack Afghanistan it was to get Osama bin Laden and close
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:48.800]  down the terrorist camps so they're going to use anything they can fake or
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:55.520]  real to keep the military machine going and to keep the people under their
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:01.040]  thumb in the height of fear and as you mentioned they're using the fear card
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:07.840]  again and they're playing the card as a trial balloon because there's going to
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:13.600]  be real reasons for fear coming down the road okay I want to go back to calls
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.800]  but I wanted to bring another subject back in January of last year a year and
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:24.320]  a half ago or almost a year and a half ago we got state of New York Bureau of
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:29.080]  Cemetery's internal documents we had emergency managers on shang they're
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:32.520]  preparing an Indiana and Illinois for millions of dead that the flu was coming
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.800]  it was going to kill millions and that the feds had to take over and have
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.240]  martial law we got the documents I warned the people then in April out of the
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:46.480]  wrong season wrong hemisphere H1N1 pops up I go on air and I say I don't know
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.400]  if this is going to be real or not whether it's real flu or not it's
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.360]  psychological terrorism just like if it's a real nuke attack or not it's
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:58.640]  psychological terrorism then the head of the EU Health Commission 47 member group
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:03.320]  Wolfgang Woodrig we had him on documented that they paid off the
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:08.160]  scientists in our governments had them lie to make tens of billions on sales
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.800]  you talked about it being a fraud I talked about it here it is the Daily
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.960]  Mail we blundered over swine flu admit health chiefs global health chiefs have
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:21.640]  finally admitted that they may have overreacted a swine flu pandemic landing
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.240]  governments with millions of unused vaccines that's the whitewash but there
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:30.360]  we are again right about the fact that H1N1 was a hoax but that it was
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.440]  genetically engineered that's been confirmed and that if you took the
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:39.160]  seasonal flu shot that's what gave you the H1N1 they were putting it in the
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.200]  vaccines that's in five new studies that they were actually I mean this is so
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.520]  diabolical it's right out in the open and nobody gets in trouble well look
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:52.600]  what's going on with the pharmaceutical companies they hired doctors and they
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:57.640]  pay the doctors to do the research and then the doctors become spokespersons
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:02.040]  for the pharmaceutical industry and they make up fake studies I mean how much
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:06.680]  more proof do you need hey ladies remember all of that estrogen they told
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:11.760]  you to take for how many years and then the people that was saying that it was
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.560]  dangerous for you and it wasn't doing the things that they claimed it was
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:21.680]  doing they would they would you know run them into the ground so yes it's every
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.400]  level and again keep making the connections you know it's the same thing
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:33.160]  it's the pharmaceutical companies it's big agriculture it's big banks and it's
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:39.520]  the Great War it all ends up it all goes into the same direction World War two
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:46.120]  World War one and the war coming up it's a war of profits they'll kill anybody
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:52.000]  they'll do anything as I said before there's nothing more than money jump okay
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.440]  Gerald Solente I want to race through calls and questions down the last 12
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.920]  14 minutes we have left here the revolt of the states there that's a Twitter
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:05.800]  question states moving to sue states talking about secession even Rick Perry
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:09.760]  talking about it declaring 10th Amendment where do you see that going
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.920]  oh definitely we wrote about this years ago secessionism is the real movement we
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.600]  can see the former we can see the United States breaking up like the former
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.280]  Soviet Union the second Vermont Republic check that one out there real this is
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.680]  for real and these are really intelligent guys Thomas Naylor I mean this
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.360]  guy's you know professor emeritus from Duke University there are a lot of
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.920]  intelligent people we can see it breaking up as the government grips more
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:42.200]  the states break apart here's another question Twitter question from Fedros it
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.800]  says the Australian economy seems to follow the US closely should the US
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:53.360]  economy implode what chance have we here in Oz they won't get hit his bed but
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:57.760]  they'll get everybody there will be very few countries that escape that that
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.280]  escape it this the best countries that we're looking at and they're in this
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:06.560]  trend journal is Australia Canada Norway New Zealand those about the top and of
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.720]  course Switzerland they're the money cockroaches of the world they never go
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.880]  anywhere but they won't get hit as bad as the United States because the country
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:20.800]  they're not as indebted as we are what do you think about state bank initiatives
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.360]  where we have state banks that give the public free credit like I don't think
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:30.240]  you give free credit at all and but what we should go back to we believe is the
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.080]  Glass-Steagall Act it worked before it saved us after the Great Depression so
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:39.320]  the criminals couldn't do what they're doing now and by the way when I the
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.960]  things that I do personally I put all my money most of our money in the in the
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.840]  community bank in the local bank I know it sound and I also of course it would
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.880]  because we're an international business we have to have international banks but
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:28:01.320]  but they can't loan for free I mean it just can't it can't work like that what
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.520]  do you see with the the population and the relationship with police now because
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:09.720]  of all these tiny handheld cameras built into cell phones iPads you name it
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:15.120]  iPhones we're really seeing police walk up beat innocent people half the death
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:20.120]  throw legless men out of wheelchairs going crazy and being encouraged to do
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:23.760]  it and now the public's really getting to see this and where do you see that
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.560]  going and where do you see the attempt to clamp down on free speech on the
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:31.520]  internet going well we're going to well they're gonna be they are clamping down
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.600]  on free speech they're gonna continue to clamp down we just saw that that that
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:44.280]  federal court ruling that was in favor of a Comcast where they can now charge
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:49.040]  different prices for different clients to give them different speeds that may
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:54.520]  come about in the future so net neutrality is really under attack as far as
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:58.920]  the police the police are becoming like goon squads for the bankers and it's
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.720]  just when that's what happens when a nation goes from first-class to third
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:09.240]  world they beat you into submission and that's what's going on in the United
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:15.200]  States more and more let's jam in a phone call here up next is Pamela in
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:21.000]  Wisconsin and Jim Paul and Chuck we'll at least get to those Jim go ahead
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:28.240]  hey Jim we're on the air how you doing buddy they go to Paul in Tennessee go
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:34.760]  ahead Paul you're on the air there you there yes sir go ahead all right I hear
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:41.400]  you people talking all the time about God gold and guns my question is this now
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:47.040]  the thing is okay buying gold would be a wise investment but my question is if
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.960]  these people have this gold and the dollar is only worth as far as I know
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:56.000]  maybe four cents why would they sell their gold for a dollar you know you
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.760]  no no no you won't there'll be inflation of the dollar so instead of getting a
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.760]  thousand dollars an ounce you might get three thousand dollars an ounce so your
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.440]  gold when you sell it would convert to whatever the currency was at that time
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:10.400]  thus protecting you from inflation Gerald Zelenti you said it that's if
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:15.240]  that's it and by the way my strategy is personally I'm I'm a I'm heavily
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:19.320]  invested in gold and happened for years and I also buy Swiss francs Canadian
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:24.760]  dollars and US dollars because what in that play all I want to do is to stay
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:29.720]  even and gold is my wild card because I believe that they're gonna devalue the
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:33.760]  dollar rather than it inflating in one way or another it's not gonna be worth
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:38.320]  it won't be able to buy a candy bar and gold is up almost 400% in the last ten
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:42.320]  years so that was a good bet for you well yeah and I we believe it's gonna
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:47.960]  hit two thousand and beyond Cindy Chuck and Eric you are straight ahead final

[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:53.720]  ahead hi Alex nice to speak to you I wanted to quickly just say I've been
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:58.000]  listening to your show for a little more than a year now it was a a breath of
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.160]  fresh air to be able to get the information that you have it's something
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:09.680]  that I've been inquisitive about for for years and you get you you were
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:15.560]  speaking vaguely about the you know the recent flu epidemic that we've been
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:19.120]  having but you know things were suspect even as far back as SARS you know what
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:22.440]  I mean when all these things in the bird flu virus when all these things would
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.840]  just pop up and then go away without any they use the environment they use bugs
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:33.880]  they use war all is a pretext to take control of our lives and but my my main
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:39.600]  comment is now my Facebook page is nothing no no BS it's nothing but
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:43.280]  informative information I need to get linked from you or other the drudge
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:48.960]  report other other all the time go ahead okay my things what do we do to to
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:52.400]  wake people up like even even in my own household I speak to my wife about
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.000]  the stuff when I can engage her shortly but her span I mean she's more
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.200]  concerned about Jesse James and and and that well Chuck Chuck Chuck there's some
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.480]  people love them to death aren't ever concerned it's like in the Godfather
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:10.400]  they say you know women and children can be careless men cannot be careless and
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.360]  a lot of men act like women and a lot of women act like men but let's talk to
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:18.320]  Gerald Salente about that I would move on to people that do want to be warned
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:23.880]  5% started this country Gerald Salente that's it it's about 20% could change
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.240]  the whole country we believe there's 20% that'll move there's a great quote
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:33.480]  attributed to Jesus Christ I can heal the sick I can make the blind see in the
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:39.920]  lame walk I can even raise the dead but I not even I can save a fool from their
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:45.480]  foolishness absolutely so just move on Chuck I mean try to educate your wife as
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.920]  things get worse she'll listen to you later Eric in North Carolina you're on
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:53.600]  the air quick question for Gerald yeah thanks a lot listen real quick is that
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:59.360]  central point behind all these scams and frauds and and tricks is the complicit
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.640]  media why aren't they the central target of our effort because without the corrupt
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:07.720]  media so many people wouldn't be fooled well the media is all losing their
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:10.720]  viewers and falling apart so they want to shut down our free space was a kick
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:14.880]  on their butt Gerald that said the biggest trend that we're writing about is
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:20.560]  going to be internet TV everything you see on that little screen now goes to the
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:24.400]  big screen and they really fearful of that because they can't keep up and
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:29.320]  compare with the content coming from an Alex Jones you're not gonna see that on
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.880]  CNN so that's the real fear and that's why they're going to clamp down on the
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:38.760]  media in the future I mean Gerald Salente's on Fox CNN you name it but
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:44.120]  here you get to hear in depth two hours I mean and here he can really you know
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:48.280]  break things down in detail thank you Eric real quick Brad in California go
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:53.760]  ahead I've got some property in Argentina actually I was wondering if you
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.840]  think that's a good safe country to be in if when all this stuff goes down
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.600]  absolutely not we'll get Gerald's opinion run by the bankers they're grabbing
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:04.760]  your pension funds right now Gerald I just got back from Argentina coming in
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:07.120]  from Chile of course yeah I don't know if you know I was there during the
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:11.880]  earthquake we don't and you know when we came over all of a sudden a couple of
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.400]  times you they had these roadblocks with helicopters and guys dressed with
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.560]  enough body armor to go through the Battle of the Bulge no it's a place
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.840]  that's on the edge but I but I would say also that you know I wouldn't buy
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:32.200]  anything anywhere I would just go someplace and check it out stay there a

[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:12.580]  Craig Roberts after Paul Craig Roberts is with us and before he sails off into
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:16.340]  the sunset at least for a while taking a break he's agreed to do a couple
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:20.300]  interviews with us he did one last week and now he's back on tax day this week
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:24.060]  to talk about the economy the value-added taxes all the things the
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:27.640]  carbon taxes they're calling for and what he talked about last week the
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:32.940]  systematic destruction by design of our economy the total conversion to
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:37.980]  basically Mexico or another third-world nation where you have a tiny elite and a
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:41.700]  giant underclass dr. Roberts great to have you here with us today sir
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:46.780]  pleased to be with you Alex you look good there with your Skype connection I
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:51.980]  see you've got Napoleon bone apart on the wall behind you yes where somebody
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:56.860]  gave me that some years ago when the French president of France gave me the
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:02.580]  French Legion of Otto and so I can't remember who it was somebody gave me this
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:10.220]  very romantic picture of a copy this is a copy of the romantic portrayal of
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:16.540]  Napoleon that's in the Louvre in Paris wow yeah you never brag about all the
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:20.700]  laurels you've gotten one of the top 10 economists living on the planet you know
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:23.980]  the drill we're going to break in about three minutes but you wanted to come on
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:27.220]  on tax day we're honored to have you here where you won't be censored break it
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:33.140]  down for us well you know Alex one of the great myths is that Americans are
[01:42:33.140 --> 01:42:37.660]  free people and once upon a time they were but they've not been free since
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:46.340]  1913 because once you have an income tax you no longer own your own labor and the
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:54.900]  historic definition of a free person is a person who owns his own labor if you
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:43:03.820]  don't own your own labor you are a surf or a slave so all Americans are either
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:09.940]  surfs or slaves depending on the bracket there are no free Americans and
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:19.180]  have not been any free Americans since 1913 so when you hear our leaders such
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:25.100]  as George W. Bush talk about we have freedom in democracy you certainly
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:33.180]  don't have freedom you're a surf all surfs were required to turn over 20 30
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:39.180]  percent of their labor time to the government of their day a slave has to
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:48.460]  turn over about half of his labor time to his owner and Americans fall in
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:55.740]  between those two ranges so every American who works and earns an income
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:44:04.860]  is either surf or slave or in between that margin and that is simply the
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:12.020]  historic definition of a free person agreed to by the liberals by Karl Marx
[01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:19.220]  by the conservatives by all historians that is the definition of a free person
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:26.500]  we don't meet that definition and people should be aware of this and that's the
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:33.700]  real message of April 15 it's remind you every year that you're not a free man
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:43.580]  or woman you are a surf of the government who has a claim to what one
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:48.660]  third of your income or more stay there dr. Paul Craig Roberts will look at the
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:52.500]  history the income tax how it's been accelerating and expanding and a lot
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:56.780]  more and how we try to shake off this bondage and your phone calls dr. Paul
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:02.300]  Craig Roberts with us in the next hour we're very honored to having hi this is

[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:39.020]  average until 1913 when we got the income tax that you will notice is in the

[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:07.020]  Alex was that of a free person owns his own labor and an income tax means the
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:12.540]  government has the first claim on your labor just like feudal lords dead or a
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:17.340]  slave master and so Americans are not free and haven't been for almost a
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:23.900]  century now for three years short of a century of living as serfs while the
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:29.820]  government tells us that we have freedom you know that under the Constitution
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:36.140]  the income tax is unconstitutional certainly nobody in the latter part of
[01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:41.580]  the 18th century was going to propose an income tax since it was so close to the
[01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:51.020]  time that serfs were becoming free labor as opposed to serfs and so the notion
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:56.460]  of having the government have a claim on your labor would have been seen as a
[01:50:56.460 --> 01:51:03.060]  step back into the dark ages or into the medieval period and so how do we get the
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:08.860]  income tax well when the Democrats wanted it to get the rich and they got
[01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:12.060]  one passed and it was ruled unconstitutional and they had to have a
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:19.020]  constitutional amendment and the way they got it if my memory serves and the
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:26.900]  Republicans wanted a higher tariff to protect the industries during our great
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:33.440]  growth period we had high tariffs and we did not develop on the basis of free
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:42.140]  trade so in order to get the tariff the Democrats said look terrorists are like
[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:47.540]  sales taxes and they're aggressive and and the people have to pay it who don't
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:56.900]  have a lot of money and so if you will go along with letting us have a go at a
[01:51:56.900 --> 01:52:03.380]  constitutional amendment on the income tax we'll let you have your time and the
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:08.060]  Republicans all said well you know the states will never pass this so let's
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:14.940]  make the deal so we can get a higher tariff so they made the deal and when it
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:22.580]  went out to the states the states looked at it and said well look look how
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:29.180]  much money you have to have before you even hit a one percent income tax rate
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:34.660]  nobody in our state has that much money we don't care if this passes it doesn't
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:42.220]  affect us and so it passed because the majority of the states came to the
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:48.940]  conclusion that nobody in the state had an income that large but of course as
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:55.740]  soon as this in World War one starts and of course they want to finance the
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:53:01.380]  war and so all of a sudden the thresholds at which the tax comes in are
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:05.980]  lowered the rates at which are charged raised and the whole population is
[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:12.860]  almost a subject to the income tax which was only going to be for the rich well
[01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:19.420]  that's how that's how it happened that's how it came in to effect it was a
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:29.780]  miscalculation as a part of a deal to be able to raise a tariff in exchange for
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:35.380]  giving the Democrats a go at a constitutional amendment to make income
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:41.060]  tax permissible well dr. Roberts let me add a caveat before you continue we
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:45.980]  notice it in the same year 1913 we get the income tax to now fund the new
[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:50.700]  central bank that so many of our forefathers had fought against as
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:54.300]  Thomas Jefferson said of you allow private corporations and banks to issue
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:58.300]  currency and credit you will wake up homeless on the continent your
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:04.700]  forefathers conquered and we also that same year got the 17th amendment taking
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:08.700]  the senators from the states voted on by the legislatures and making them
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:16.580]  federal creatures so further dominating the states and so the central banks that
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:20.380]  helped in private banks that helped ram this through did it in the name of
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:23.900]  getting the rich guys the robber barons but really the robber barons that help
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:27.900]  them vertically integrate the economy and now we see the super rich today
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:32.140]  vertically integrating the economy and waging war on the economy economic
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:37.780]  warfare through this system almost a hundred years later that's true and
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:42.660]  that's one of the subjects of my recent book how the economy was lost you gave
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:51.980]  a very good summary of what happened all of it in the name of reform and of
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:57.100]  course the reforms destroyed the federal structure and gave us the powerful
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:01.580]  central government you know the Civil War did a great job in destroying
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:12.620]  states rights but certain amounts of it remained until 1913
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:22.380]  Dr. Roberts I want to talk more about the income tax and all the new taxes they
[01:55:22.380 --> 01:55:26.260]  want to pile on that are similar but what about the states and property taxes
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:29.900]  many states didn't have property taxes until the last 20 30 years and they go
[01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:35.580]  up and up and up that's another classic feudal surf tax where you didn't own the
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:39.540]  land you were on you were the keeper of it but you had to pay a percentage to the
[01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:50.060]  nobles yes of course you property taxes really aren't affordable because even if
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:57.140]  you rent from a landlord he has to pay the tax so it goes into the rent property
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:06.780]  tax the reason given for that and what was used was to fund public schools so
[01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:15.220]  you find the public school system based on the on the property tax and therefore
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:24.620]  this made it free so to speak since property tax wasn't affordable and
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:30.580]  people paid the property tax so they used public schools and and this was a
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:36.820]  great setback to private education and it was another mechanism for government
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:44.740]  to condition the thinking of people to brainwash them through time to make
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:52.860]  them think that they are free and have democracy even though they are the
[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:57.460]  service of the government the government has a very powerful claim on their
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:03.420]  income let me illustrate that a little bit more back during the slavery period
[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:12.060]  in the United States there were slaves who had special skills they were
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:20.140]  craftsmen they were highly trained in some aspect of arts and crafts and they
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:26.700]  were their labor was worth more than working in the cotton fields or working
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:32.580]  on the plantation and so what would happen is the owners of the slave would
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:42.180]  lease the slave to a businessman in a city or town and the man who leased a
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:47.620]  slave would withhold half of the slaves earnings and send it back to the owner
[01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:53.500]  and give the other half to the slave which he used to maintain himself in
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:58:01.340]  town where he lived you know on his own resources after tax well that's the way
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:07.420]  it works today most people cannot avoid income tax because they never get the
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:12.420]  money it's withheld the source and by the way we've seen this new hoax by AP and
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:16.660]  others I see it all over the news that 47% of Americans don't pay income tax
[01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:21.220]  after deductions but what is FICA and social security don't they know that
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:24.460]  their employers are just paying them less because they have to pay all those
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:31.220]  other taxes and matching social security FICA I mean this lie that 47% of the
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:36.460]  public are avoiding taxes as a hoax is it not yes it's a hoax most of the things
[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:43.900]  they they tell you are also tell you the rich don't pay taxes but IRS
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:48.100]  statistics of income show the rich pay almost all the taxes because they have
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:54.980]  much of the income and so just about everything people think they know about
[01:58:54.980 --> 01:59:00.940]  the income tax system is as well well now there are some international
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:07.980]  corporations though in offshoring they are avoiding a lot of taxes not
[01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:13.620]  necessarily you see you're taxed on your worldwide income if you're paying is if
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:17.420]  you're if you're a global corporation so you're operating the United States and
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:23.580]  say you're for example and and you you're taxed in Germany and France then
[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:31.340]  that income is an offset to those earnings and it is not again taxed and
[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:39.300]  by the United States government so it's it's not really the case that they can
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:43.980]  avoid taxes all right stay there we got a break then why then do we see the
[01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:47.740]  mega corporations always lobbying for more taxes or the big health care
[01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:52.820]  insurance companies lobbying for health care we'll ask Dr. Roberts that question
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:57.300]  we come back to talk about where he sees this nation going as he said last week
[01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:00.820]  the economy is being destroyed by design we're going to expand on that stay

[02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:17.820]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts again our guest joining us on April 15, 2010 I want to
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:22.420]  open the phones up for Dr. Roberts 1-800-259-9231 we'll take a few calls
[02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:26.700]  before he leaves us okay Dr. this is a short segment fleshing out expanding on
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:30.940]  that point you're making that they're destroying the economy by design why why
[02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:35.260]  are some of the biggest corporations in the world with government pushing to
[02:04:35.260 --> 02:04:43.140]  turn people into indentured servants yes well I think to make people aware of
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:51.580]  that fact is probably more important than to know all the reasons why if you
[02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:59.620]  a lot of it is a result of unintended consequences and most of the rest is
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:06.820]  result of short-term greed the way the incentive structure for top management
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:13.820]  corporations is structured it gives them a very short-term horizon they want to
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:17.860]  know what the profits are next quarter the longest horizon they have is it is
[02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:26.140]  four quarters and in the way these things are structured their their bonuses
[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:33.700]  that they get for performance far far exceeds their regular salaries so they
[02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:39.340]  make themselves multi-million dollar incomes by moving American jobs all
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:45.580]  short because they then replace American labor with very very inexpensive
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:51.900]  foreign labor in countries where there is huge surplus of unemployed labor in
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:06:00.740]  China for example a couple hundred million unemployed people to draw on so by
[02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:07.180]  severely cutting their labor costs the profits jump dramatically and they get
[02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:15.700]  enormous bonuses and that's the basic source of it and it's why the prospects
[02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:22.780]  the economic prospects for millions of Americans are gone and not just people
[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:29.380]  live today but future generations the kinds of jobs that college graduates
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:34.580]  used to get are simply disappearing they're they're they're they're moved
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:41.300]  abroad or they are filled with foreign guest workers on H1B visas and L1
[02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:47.980]  visas and so it's actually making the universities redundant why in the world
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:55.220]  did you go pursue university careers with the notion of some professional career
[02:06:55.220 --> 02:07:00.620]  that's been destroyed by the offshoring of the jobs so it's having a tremendous
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:05.580]  adverse impact on the United States and you and other economists talk about how
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:09.180]  these jobs aren't coming back it took hundreds of years to bill what we've got
[02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:14.380]  now just a few decades to destroy it there was open discussion by the IMF
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:18.380]  and World Bank now of the dollar going down they're saying they need more
[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:23.740]  bailouts VAT taxes sales taxes carbon taxes when any economist worth their
[02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:28.260]  salt knows an installing economy you throw more taxes on that will just
[02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:34.980]  accelerate the economy's implosion that's right you see by by wrecking the
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:39.500]  economy they have worsened the trade deficit dramatically they have worsened
[02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:44.340]  the federal budget deficit which they can no longer finance and that is a
[02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:48.580]  threat to the dollar as reserve currency which is a threat to their power of the
[02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:55.020]  United States and so now it looks like the hard-pressed Americans could be hit
[02:07:55.020 --> 02:08:01.420]  with new forms of oppressive taxation such as a value added tax on top of the
[02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:08.980]  income and social security tax and state sales taxes and property taxes so they
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:13.860]  have by putting the dollar into jeopardy and having to rescue the dollar in
[02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:19.340]  order to rescue the power of the American military superstate they have to
[02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:27.580]  drive the population or 96 percent of it deeper into the ground and that's
[02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:35.220]  exactly what is on the agenda and the you know the the result for the American
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:39.980]  people is going to be horrific they're gonna be put through the mill in a way
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:45.460]  that people haven't experienced in the longest longest time yeah this is this
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:50.620]  taxation rate is much higher for my study than what caused the colonies to
[02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:56.620]  rebel but also they were having fake courts royal courts that bypassed
[02:08:56.620 --> 02:09:01.260]  juries and the right of Magna Carta and habeas corpus and you look at all those
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:09.740]  parallels they're identical to what led up to 1775 1776 but magnified yes it's
[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:18.420]  all a repeat isn't it habeas corpus is gone due process is gone the attorney
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:24.140]  client privilege is gone now they force attorneys to rat on the clients it's
[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:28.900]  but of course you know one difference is the population a couple hundred years
[02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:34.740]  ago was more feisty and there wasn't much difference between the weaponry in
[02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:39.020]  the hands of people and the weaponry in the hands of the state stay there let's
[02:09:39.020 --> 02:09:42.220]  talk about that when we come back long segment coming up with dr. Paul Craig

[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:11.660]  Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become
[02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:15.300]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold
[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:18.660]  and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again
[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:22.860]  so our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of

[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:38.660]  police state the rise of FEMA coming out next week that I've made over the last
[02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:43.500]  year proving this police state control grid and at the FEMA camps do indeed
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:50.940]  exist going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts separately on the police state
[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:54.540]  regardless of the emergency centers act regardless of the John Warner Defense
[02:13:54.540 --> 02:13:58.780]  Authorization Act Patriot Act we know US citizens are being grabbed the
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:03.020]  military is torturing them they are holding them without trial all of this
[02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:07.860]  is going on the denial needs to end about the level of tyranny accelerating
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:15.540]  in our society well Alex I don't know how much of it goes on but what we do
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:20.820]  know for certain is that they have removed the barriers to it and can do it
[02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:26.060]  whenever they want they can they can grab whoever they want we have you know
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:32.500]  the head of Homeland Security are fairly recently saying that Homeland
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:38.940]  Security was shifting its attention from from foreign terrorists to domestic
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:46.700]  American extremists and we had not long ago the arrest of the of a blonde blue
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:52.740]  eyed woman as a terrorist so they they're already moving away from the
[02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:59.020]  Muslim threat and they use that to get all of those police state measures in
[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:06.220]  place and now they can apply them to the general population but Alex before we go
[02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:13.300]  off into that let me say one more thing about the income tax absolutely many
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:20.460]  progressives in liberals get disturbed at criticisms of the income tax because
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:27.180]  they think it's used for the poor I was on a show just the other day where the
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:34.740]  host those thought the income tax paid for public schools and roads and was
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:41.100]  unaware that the road system was built with gasoline tax and that the public
[02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:48.860]  schools have funded property tax but what let me just make a point about the use
[02:15:48.860 --> 02:15:57.900]  of the income tax revenues the last week David Lindoff published an article in
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:03.420]  which he said if you add up all of the military spending not just the put on
[02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:08.460]  the Pentagon's budget but all of the other related military spending that's
[02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:13.820]  dispersed throughout the budget and other departments in the supplementalist
[02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:24.100]  wars and the CIA and so forth that it comes to 53% of the federal income tax
[02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:34.860]  revenues so that more than half of the federal income tax revenues are used to
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:42.500]  fund the military now this is an extraordinary thing I don't think it was
[02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:50.260]  this bad doing the dark ages but if you have the military function of the
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:59.780]  government which has now 53% of the inserved labor goes to support this
[02:16:59.780 --> 02:17:07.860]  is an extraordinary thing and it gives the the military security complex such
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:13.300]  power because a lot of these funds are recycled into political campaign
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:19.820]  contributions that it's almost impossible to budge this now if you look at
[02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:25.140]  the size of the American budget and then you military spending the total fame
[02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:31.460]  that London presents then you add in that of all of our allies in Europe
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:36.780]  Japan and then the nations that are friendly to us it accounts for two
[02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:44.420]  thirds of world military spending and so how do we face a threat how is Iran a
[02:17:44.420 --> 02:17:50.100]  threat now this is really very interesting because Iran's annual
[02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:57.940]  military budget is 4.8 billion dollars cost of maybe what two weeks of our war
[02:17:57.940 --> 02:18:05.180]  and Afghanistan 4.8 billion is what the Pentagon spends on childcare and
[02:18:05.180 --> 02:18:12.500]  recreation it's what it spends on its replacement helicopters or one or two
[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:20.340]  stealth bombers so here so here is Iran with a military budget equal to what
[02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:25.460]  the Pentagon spends on childcare and recreation and it's a threat to America
[02:18:25.460 --> 02:18:31.540]  it's amazing now going back you were you were Ronald Reagan's chief financial
[02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:36.540]  market advisor the father of Reaganomics had a policy at the Treasury what
[02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:40.780]  about the grace commission because my reading of that it boils down to not
[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:45.100]  one red cent of it goes to the American people or to run the country from my
[02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:50.420]  reading much of the money goes to interest on the debt does it not well
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:58.660]  now and one way they are keeping that down is the Federal Reserve is buying
[02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:03.180]  so much of the debt is ordered to hold down the interest rate but the minute
[02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:07.980]  that blows up which it has to sooner or later the cost of carrying the debt is
[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:13.060]  going to be horrific what if the you remember the short term interest rates
[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:20.020]  that both are stuck on you know 17 percent I can remember with long-term
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:24.060]  treasuries when I went into the Treasury the interest rate on long-term
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:30.740]  treasuries was 16% can you imagine those kinds of interest rates today let me
[02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:35.020]  ask you that they're now talking about raising interest rates a what will that
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:41.900]  do and then B we've got Volcker Obama and people like Glenn Beck calling for
[02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:49.140]  sales taxes value-added taxes carbon taxes saying we've got to pay this well
[02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:55.860]  the carbon tax in my opinion is something that Wall Street and corporations
[02:19:55.860 --> 02:20:03.820]  have cooked up and the purpose of the carbon tax is to make pollution
[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:09.940]  profitable because you can now buy and sell the right to pollute and of course
[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:13.420]  Wall Street will turn it into derivative sure but what will that do to the
[02:20:13.420 --> 02:20:23.980]  economy I don't I don't think that that is the threat to the economy they may
[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:31.140]  not help but the threat is is another unregulated over-counter derivative
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:38.380]  instrument in which pollution becomes profitable so it doesn't help the
[02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:47.780]  environment what does VAT do VAT it drives up the price of everything people
[02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:57.620]  buy it's us it's a very high sales tax a federal sales tax what it does is it
[02:20:57.620 --> 02:21:05.380]  taxes the value added to a product at every stage so if we say okay we go dig
[02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:11.060]  up the iron ore and so the act of digging the ore out of the ground that
[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:15.540]  makes it more valuable because it's now accessible so the difference in the
[02:21:15.540 --> 02:21:19.860]  value the oil in the ground and the value or dug out that difference is
[02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:25.540]  value added in his taxed and then the iron ore is converted into iron or
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:31.820]  steel and that is another enhancement of value and that value is taxed and in the
[02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:38.380]  steel is converted into products cars steel beams whatever a sheet metal then
[02:21:38.380 --> 02:21:43.260]  it's packaged then it's shipped as in it sold that is the fact that every level
[02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:50.700]  and you know the value added taxes in Europe are 20 22% they may be higher
[02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:59.940]  now and so that then becomes an enormous sales tax on that's why cars call so
[02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:05.100]  much in Europe that's why washing machines and dryers and appliances and
[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:14.220]  refrigerators and stoves they all have this tax and fuel and fuel so it's a way
[02:22:14.220 --> 02:22:22.220]  of suppressing the purchasing power and living standards of the people and then
[02:22:22.220 --> 02:22:25.980]  meanwhile you have China and India and others don't have a VAT won't that drive
[02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:33.660]  the few industries we have left out of the country well you see the value added
[02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:45.140]  tax is rebated on exports but it's applied to imports so it a country that
[02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:50.980]  has a value added tax in a trade situation has an advantage over one that
[02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:59.860]  doesn't because when you're exports these products to us they rebate that tax
[02:22:59.860 --> 02:23:03.780]  but we don't have any industry really left as you've said so that that isn't
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:12.220]  good and we don't have the value added tax and so it doesn't come in taxed but
[02:23:12.220 --> 02:23:19.620]  if it goes from one value added country to another when it leaves it's rebated
[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:24.020]  but when it gets the other country is charged all right doctor I want to move
[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:27.340]  quickly through some other subjects but going back to overall taxes because you
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:30.540]  wanted to come on today and we're honored to have you specifically other
[02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:34.020]  points you'd like to make about the income tax and I want to ask you where
[02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:38.020]  do you see all this leading because I mean clearly this is a vertical
[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:42.420]  integration a criminal consolidation they have no appearances of even slowing
[02:23:42.420 --> 02:23:49.740]  down only accelerating how do you see this unfolding well the the people and
[02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:55.740]  the vast majority of Americans will find a short decline in their living
[02:23:55.740 --> 02:24:03.460]  standard and there's no way there's no way around it because not only on the
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:11.860]  jobs the best jobs are disappearing but all of these taxes will particularly
[02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:17.580]  value value added tax will seriously reduce their purchasing power if you
[02:24:17.580 --> 02:24:24.100]  had a 20% value added tax for example it means that 20% of your purchases that
[02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:30.780]  you currently have a wiped out and so you see a 20% reduction in your real
[02:24:30.780 --> 02:24:37.740]  income expanding expanding on that the trick again as they've had fake
[02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:42.060]  conservatives promoting VAT for almost two decades saying we're gonna get rid
[02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:45.060]  of the income tax but now they're saying oh no we're gonna have the income tax and
[02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:49.340]  the VAT but don't worry it'll only be 2% well that's how the federal income tax
[02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:54.780]  started right that's right you know as we said earlier in your program today the
[02:24:54.780 --> 02:25:00.620]  reason the income tax amendment passed the constitutional amendment that one
[02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:06.260]  was that the vast majority of states didn't have anybody living in them that
[02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:12.220]  had income higher enough to be taxed under the original proposal so sure once
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:16.060]  you have but the same thing happens state sales taxes I can remember when the
[02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:26.180]  first sales tax was 1% what are they now 6 7 8 so if it's a 2% value added tax
[02:25:26.180 --> 02:25:32.980]  it won't be 2% very long very quickly rise up as in Europe and as I said
[02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:43.100]  they're 20% or more now where all this may end is that the dollar may simply
[02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:51.060]  collapse it may lose its reserve currency role in which case it will be the
[02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:56.620]  end of the evil empire because the wars won't be you can't finance them the
[02:25:56.620 --> 02:26:02.380]  only way they can finance all of these wars and all this military spending is
[02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:06.420]  that the dollar is a reserve currency and we can pay our bills simply by
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:12.500]  printing money nobody else can do that so if we lose that role then you will see
[02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:18.540]  a collapse in the empire and you will also see a collapse in living standards
[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:23.980]  because it would have a similar effect as a value added tax in reducing people's
[02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:29.820]  incomes because the value of it would fall dramatically and so all of the
[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:36.420]  imports on which we are dependent would rise in price and this would also have
[02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:42.500]  the effect of reducing Americans real incomes for the future Alex is going to
[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:46.900]  be different than the past when people could look forward to a rising level of
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:52.580]  income now I'm afraid they'll have to look forward to declining levels of real
[02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:56.540]  income I want to take a few calls here in the end of this segment the next with
[02:26:56.540 --> 02:27:00.660]  you we really appreciate you spending time with us but you know we know there's
[02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:04.580]  some global organization of this but it's driven by the greed the short-term
[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:09.580]  view but at the UN level it's a long-term view but it lends credence to what
[02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:14.780]  you're saying that it's just a bunch of looters and not organized at some point
[02:27:14.780 --> 02:27:19.420]  because I'm reading in Texas and in Ohio and in Michigan and New Jersey and all
[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:24.260]  over more than 10 states going bankrupt or on the verge some sheriffs and police
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:28.620]  departments slashing by more than half police saying buy your own guns to
[02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:34.300]  protect yourself as taxes go up more and more goes to address on the debt and a
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:39.980]  corporate welfare and actual road warrior type scenarios where one counting
[02:27:39.980 --> 02:27:43.740]  in Ohio that has over a hundred thousand people will have one cop on duty for
[02:27:43.740 --> 02:27:49.180]  every shift from 116 that they had I mean this we're looking at potential
[02:27:49.180 --> 02:27:58.980]  road warrior type collapse could be it could be I think most likely though the
[02:27:58.980 --> 02:28:05.100]  last thing government will let go of or the forces that protect them and the
[02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:09.700]  notion that the police protect the public is probably not correct the police
[02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:19.140]  protect the government if you think the FBI protects you you're just like the
[02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:24.260]  military doesn't protect the people it protects the government that pays its
[02:28:24.260 --> 02:28:37.100]  salary so I'm not sure that the a lot of the gang activity won't come from police
[02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:43.060]  because they're an organized armed force and people are not organized and
[02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:48.500]  that's a key point they said in Ohio they were gonna keep 49 of the 116
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:52.900]  deputies and that now only one would be on patrol for the citizens the rest out
[02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:56.220]  collecting revenues so now they're admitting we're here to collect revenue
[02:28:56.220 --> 02:29:02.260]  we're not going to protect you they actually say that that's right and you
[02:29:02.260 --> 02:29:06.100]  know they can collect revenues in in different way than taxes and to shake
[02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:15.860]  you down so I who knows Alex we don't need to get this far into it we can't
[02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:23.260]  predict what's what the behavior will be that closely but we do know that the
[02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:29.380]  kinds of restraints that restrained government power are being removed yes
[02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:37.780]  and we do know that the sort of economy we had produced rising consumer
[02:29:37.780 --> 02:29:43.060]  incomes is being dismantled and that the more likely prospect is falling
[02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:50.180]  consumer income so you get a mixture of a weaker poor public and a stronger
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:57.900]  less accountable government and that that is enough to make us disturbed and
[02:29:57.900 --> 02:30:04.420]  wary when you see the people becoming economically weaker and the government
[02:30:04.420 --> 02:30:10.100]  becoming less accountable and more powerful less restrained by law by the
[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:15.060]  Constitution and that is the real dilemma that we're in can I hold up my book
[02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:21.500]  real quickly absolutely this is the this is the latest book I've written and a
[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:27.380]  lot of people who get motivated to try to learn something about economics they
[02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:31.060]  get a book they try to read it and they can't it's full of jargon it's skyed
[02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:38.020]  equations it's dense this this book is written like a column for a newspaper
[02:30:38.020 --> 02:30:44.060]  and people can follow you're a great writer and we've got the book holding
[02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:47.860]  it up on TV ourselves how the economy was lost dr. Paul Craig Roberts I promise

[02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:14.500]  that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture

[02:34:12.980 --> 02:34:15.700]  should have gone to your colleges Roberts has so much knowledge I have so many
[02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:20.420]  questions jamming in a few calls gem in Missouri you're on the air with dr. Paul
[02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:26.340]  Craig Roberts hey mr. Roberts so I mean it's really nice to talk to you you've
[02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:31.860]  got a lot of experience on you know taxes and everything else and where you
[02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:37.100]  came from in life as far as all the information has been provided to you I
[02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:44.220]  guess my question to you would be and all of your research what would the
[02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:50.140]  average individual knowing okay so they read your books and and follow some of
[02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:55.740]  them what do we do about this is that the question well yeah the average
[02:34:55.740 --> 02:35:00.460]  individual is just gonna take us as a grain of salt they don't have no
[02:35:00.460 --> 02:35:07.380]  direction to counter direct the government so I guess my question to you
[02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:15.500]  is if you were able to provide some sort of a movement what how would you understand
[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:21.260]  the question thank you Jim I mean what do we do about this dr. Roberts well we
[02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:28.660]  not be able to do anything about it until it just falls apart though you know
[02:35:28.660 --> 02:35:34.740]  last week in one of the one of the stands you know part of the former Soviet
[02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:41.660]  Empire was a Kurdish Kurdistan all of a sudden the people just revolting through
[02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:53.540]  the going out and they did this despite being fired on by troops and so at some
[02:35:53.540 --> 02:36:03.660]  point maybe people will have nothing left to lose well and will revolt the
[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:10.340]  only other solution is a long-term solution of restoring veneration of the
[02:36:10.340 --> 02:36:15.060]  Constitution so that people say that's what's important is protecting the
[02:36:15.060 --> 02:36:19.540]  Constitution we can't do anything that undermines the Constitution or the
[02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:23.100]  restraints that it places on government but that would take a long time the law
[02:36:23.100 --> 02:36:25.980]  schools would have to have a change of mind they would have to teach a
[02:36:25.980 --> 02:36:30.580]  generation of law students they would have to enter into the into the
[02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:36.980]  judiciary especially the federal judiciary and the bar associations would
[02:36:36.980 --> 02:36:40.260]  have to change instead the criminals have gotten in and brought in all their
[02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:44.460]  people but I agree we need to put out the message of our gangsters looting
[02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:50.620]  gangs we have a government of looters that's what we have a government rather
[02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:58.140]  controlled by organized looting groups the big offshoring corporations Wall
[02:36:58.140 --> 02:37:04.260]  Street these are all gangster operations well absolutely by every yardstick by
[02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:07.100]  every measurement but I think it's important also just to point out their
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:10.900]  criminals and give people the alternative of the Republic of the Bill of
[02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:14.340]  Rights of the Constitution so that people can recognize this tyranny and
[02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:18.060]  counter I mean I'm sure you saw the Wall Street Journal where they admit that
[02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:22.020]  NBC and others have propaganda placement or behavior placement in the shows
[02:37:22.020 --> 02:37:28.100]  brainwashing people with federal funds right that's right and of course the
[02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:33.820]  federal government pays people to go on to internet sites and and try to discredit
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:39.580]  anybody that speaks truth and the State Department does this and it's also used
[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:43.100]  worldwide they use it to try to destabilize governments that aren't
[02:37:43.100 --> 02:37:48.900]  American puppets and so there's a tremendous use of a propaganda and it's
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:54.020]  very difficult for American people to ever get a firm grasp on what the real
[02:37:54.020 --> 02:37:59.140]  situation is they're too busy trying to have a living pay the rent hold on to
[02:37:59.140 --> 02:38:02.860]  the home or whatever doc we're out of time I appreciate the hour on tax day
