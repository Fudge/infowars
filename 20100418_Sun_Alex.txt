[00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.545]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:11.528]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:24.860]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.381]  Sunday, April 18th, 2010.
[00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:34.604]  And we're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:37.726]  The information we're going to cover just gets more and more intense.
[00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:42.668]  When I tell you this is an important broadcast, those that have been listening for a long time understand that I mean it.
[00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:46.710]  But this is going to be a particularly important broadcast.
[00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.492]  For that reason, I'm not even opening the phones up until the second hour today.
[00:00:55.748 --> 00:00:59.251]  Bill Clinton went on CNN on Friday.
[00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:11.260]  He gave speeches Wednesday and Thursday saying he hopes there doesn't have to be a terror attack in America to make the Tea Party stop calling for violence, basically, which the Tea Parties are not doing.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.842]  This is the talking point.
[00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:14.503]  This is the dirty trick.
[00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:23.110]  Even Rick Perry was in the Houston Chronicle Friday putting on an alert to Republicans, the governor of Texas, that Democrats may stage dirty tricks.
[00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:31.826]  We know Democratic Party operatives and others have been caught all over the nation with Nazi signs at events.
[00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:38.428]  Even Rush Limbaugh came out Friday and said Bill Clinton and his people may stage something.
[00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:41.069]  This is unprecedented.
[00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:42.309]  Now they're being vague about it.
[00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:44.829]  We know exactly what Limbaugh is talking about.
[00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.130]  It was Clinton's controllers that bombed Oklahoma City in 1995.
[00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.371]  The evidence on that front is so voluminous it'll make your head spin.
[00:01:52.648 --> 00:01:57.635]  Of course, Tim McVeigh on record said that it's going to come out that the government ran this operation.
[00:01:57.635 --> 00:02:07.748]  Now they're airing these tapes and distorted information on MSNBC and CNN to bolster the official story of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.
[00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:28.858]  So we're going to be walking through this today, and separately, I have received information from two different high-level sources that are bulletproof, that are absolute bona fide, about things happening in Texas, and I'm not at liberty
[00:02:30.526 --> 00:02:36.469]  To even give the exact border sector, because that will identify the military units that are down there.
[00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:46.933]  I am at liberty to tell you, it's a West Texas border area with Mexico.
[00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:50.915]  And this is very, very dangerous information.
[00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:56.618]  I mean, you know what, I want to fight the New World Order, but I gotta be honest, I'm in way over my head.
[00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:01.056]  We take it as it comes.
[00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.637]  We do our job.
[00:03:02.637 --> 00:03:03.658]  We do our duty here.
[00:03:03.658 --> 00:03:06.280]  It's just, I wish this would end.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.782]  I wish the Newell Order would back off.
[00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:13.006]  I wish they would stop.
[00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:22.254]  FEMA has ordered a major news service, Public Intelligence, to remove documents on National Level Exercise 2010.
[00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:30.256]  That's a separate huge issue dealing with nuke attacks in the United States.
[00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:41.606]  When you understand that FEMA runs drills to cover up real terror attacks being carried out by intelligence agencies, foreign governments, and private mercenary black ops squads, it becomes even more serious.
[00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:46.116]  It is all coming up today.
[00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:58.001]  We'll also get into the new bank regulations that are being pushed by Obama that actually give the private banks that are robbing us more power and more money, more taxpayer money.
[00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:02.643]  We'll be breaking that down as well.
[00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:07.405]  But I don't even know what to start first with when we come back from this quick break.
[00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:11.523]  I do hours of research every day.
[00:04:11.523 --> 00:04:12.784]  I have it all here in front of me.
[00:04:12.784 --> 00:04:15.307]  In fact, give me a document cam shot of just the whole desk.
[00:04:15.307 --> 00:04:17.991]  This is just the news from yesterday and today.
[00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.593]  The intel I've got.
[00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.855]  The information.
[00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:22.816]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:04:22.816 --> 00:04:27.362]  I just hope people realize how dire our straits are and that
[00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:40.282]  It does a disservice to just cover the full spectrum because I need to just focus in on one issue and spend two hours on it to really flesh it out for people, but then we don't have that luxury of time.
[00:04:40.282 --> 00:04:50.891]  So, I will try to be as brief and focused and detailed as I can on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:52.892]  But these are the times that try men's souls.
[00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:53.973]  There's no doubt.
[00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:58.197]  Criminal elements of the government are preparing to stage terror attacks and blame it on the American people.
[00:04:59.363 --> 00:05:00.664]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.664 --> 00:05:06.247]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:05:06.247 --> 00:05:11.270]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.854]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:05:16.854 --> 00:05:22.077]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:23.958]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:29.179]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:30.299]  And here's the best part.
[00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:33.340]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.981]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:40.162]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:42.402]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:05:42.402 --> 00:05:43.322]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:48.404]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:05:48.404 --> 00:05:56.028]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:05:56.028 --> 00:05:58.409]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:09.677]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:06:09.677 --> 00:06:11.318]  You want answers?
[00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:12.639]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.061]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:25.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:30.867]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation, I am Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:32.188]  It is Sunday, April 18th, 2010.
[00:06:34.705 --> 00:07:00.903]  Okay, if you're a new listener or if you're somebody who's tuned in on AM and FM stations, or satellite, or shortwave, or internet, over time, and you think that we're joking around on this show, you think that we're exaggerating, you think this is a conspiracy theory that is discussed on this radio broadcast, it is a conspiracy theory, it is conspiracy fact, and I want all of you
[00:07:03.035 --> 00:07:12.041]  To listen very carefully to what I'm going to say, because it's getting late for this country and this republic.
[00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:13.742]  I want you to listen to me very carefully.
[00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:21.748]  I'm not going to take any calls during the first hour because I have so much vital news to cover.
[00:07:21.748 --> 00:07:24.690]  Number one, we have law enforcement sources.
[00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:35.612]  And when I get up here and I tell you I have law enforcement and military sources, I'm not tooting my horn when I point out all the national news stories we've broken.
[00:07:35.612 --> 00:07:40.178]  I'm simply pointing out for people that want to go look it up to find out that we are the progenitors of it.
[00:07:41.158 --> 00:07:56.563]  The clergy response teams, two years before it was declassified, tens of thousands of preachers trained to tell their flocks in a secret CIA FEMA program that guns are bad, that the Second Amendment's bad, and that during emergencies we need to go to FEMA camps.
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:10.472]  The MIAC and Homeland Security reports of January of 2009, where patriots, conservatives, gun owners, returning veterans are listed as the number one enemies of the government.
[00:08:10.472 --> 00:08:16.518]  We got those secret documents from two separate state and federal law enforcement sources.
[00:08:16.518 --> 00:08:21.403]  And for a week, people couldn't even believe it was real, including my friend Ron Paul.
[00:08:22.762 --> 00:08:25.925]  I got a call from his office about it three days into it.
[00:08:25.925 --> 00:08:27.266]  They couldn't even believe it.
[00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:30.429]  Then it was on Fox, CNN, everywhere and was confirmed.
[00:08:30.429 --> 00:08:34.152]  We do not make things up here, okay?
[00:08:34.152 --> 00:08:38.336]  And we've broken hundreds of other major stories.
[00:08:38.336 --> 00:08:49.606]  And most of the time I'm so busy when I get a document or material, I don't even have time to track it down or if I can't 100% confirm it, we shred it and throw it in the trash and delete it.
[00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:56.210]  This is very dangerous, the situation we're in.
[00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:05.379]  Now, it had to be five, six months ago we started getting calls on air from West Texas and South Texas towns that Mexican troops were over the border.
[00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:06.981]  The Minutemen got video of it.
[00:09:10.603 --> 00:09:22.531]  I called several sheriffs, some of which we've interviewed before, but I don't want to give out names here and say exactly the sheriff we talked to because they want this to be off the record, but these are people we've interviewed before.
[00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:26.834]  I've interviewed quite a few South Texas and West Texas sheriffs.
[00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.235]  I have to be very careful here.
[00:09:30.663 --> 00:09:37.908]  I was getting calls that there were Mexican troops and Mexican helicopters all over the place, and that shots were being fired.
[00:09:37.908 --> 00:09:43.651]  And I called and confirmed that this was going on.
[00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:56.119]  And of course, you've seen it in AP and other places, back of the newspaper, in Arizona and Texas over the last five years, where Mexican troops have come across and fired at Border Patrol, fired at Sheriff's deputies, robbed Sheriff's deputies at gunpoint.
[00:09:57.403 --> 00:09:59.464]  When they intercept a load of drugs.
[00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:02.026]  I mean, that's been in the news.
[00:10:02.026 --> 00:10:06.748]  Generally, months after we cover it.
[00:10:06.748 --> 00:10:13.992]  But, a lot of times it takes a long time to get a clear picture on exactly what's happening.
[00:10:13.992 --> 00:10:20.395]  You'll have all these different pieces of intelligence, but then it takes years to figure out exactly what's going on, and now it's 100% clear.
[00:10:22.813 --> 00:10:29.474]  In the last week and a half, I've talked to several law enforcement sources at the highest levels.
[00:10:29.474 --> 00:10:36.476]  I've talked to a state house source, Texas legislature based in Austin.
[00:10:36.476 --> 00:10:42.357]  And now I have confirmed from a direct military source.
[00:10:42.357 --> 00:10:43.397]  And that's all I can say.
[00:10:43.397 --> 00:10:46.238]  That's all I can say.
[00:10:48.188 --> 00:10:51.031]  I'm going to go ahead and get this out now before they shot us down or something.
[00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:53.753]  I mean, this is very serious what you're about to hear.
[00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:55.675]  I want you to understand this.
[00:10:55.675 --> 00:11:07.905]  In a West Texas County bordering Mexico, in the last three weeks, Mexican troops
[00:11:09.105 --> 00:11:20.715]  Under the Security and Prosperity Partnership, and that's separately mainstream news confirmed, that they're training with the U.S., went in and set up an ambush with the U.S.
[00:11:20.715 --> 00:11:26.440]  Army and Border Patrol for a particular cartel bringing drugs in on the U.S.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.322]  side over a half mile in.
[00:11:28.322 --> 00:11:28.782]  The U.S.
[00:11:28.782 --> 00:11:31.344]  forces waited on the other side of a hill.
[00:11:31.344 --> 00:11:35.628]  The Mexican drug dealers came in and the Mexican troops wiped them all out and killed them.
[00:11:37.884 --> 00:11:50.992]  Now, there have been a bunch of these events, and that's why I can't tell you the specific county, because then that will identify the units.
[00:11:50.992 --> 00:11:54.534]  But you need to understand, there is a full bore war.
[00:11:56.209 --> 00:11:56.869]  Going on.
[00:11:56.869 --> 00:11:58.950]  Now, let's go back many years ago.
[00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.671]  I've been telling you the last six years, because I have the sheriff's on.
[00:12:02.671 --> 00:12:05.872]  South Texas, West Texas towns are collapsing.
[00:12:05.872 --> 00:12:07.493]  It is blood in the streets.
[00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:10.734]  Former high-level DEA agent, Stella Castillo,
[00:12:13.127 --> 00:12:17.271]  Four and a half years ago here said that Los Zetas was being trained by the U.S.
[00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:20.874]  military with Mexican troops and that it's a drug war.
[00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:21.815]  You've got the U.S.
[00:12:21.815 --> 00:12:31.104]  banks and the Mexican government knocking out cartels that aren't laundering their money through them and that are shipping cocaine, heroin and marijuana in that aren't laundering it.
[00:12:32.014 --> 00:12:33.294]  It's just what Afghanistan is.
[00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:38.896]  We're there, and Reuters even reported, the Russians said, let's spray the poppy fields two weeks ago, and NATO and the U.S.
[00:12:38.896 --> 00:12:43.897]  said no, and there's more than 12 times what there was 10 years ago now coming in.
[00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:47.898]  Over 90% of world opium production is now in Afghanistan.
[00:12:47.898 --> 00:12:54.600]  It was down to less than 20% before 9-11.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.061]  And so all this is, Mexico is collapsing because you have
[00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:01.176]  Drug prohibition.
[00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:02.957]  And so that makes the price high.
[00:13:02.957 --> 00:13:15.542]  And you've got real drug dealers who aren't government run, who are in there together, working together, attacking Mexican forces, Mexican federal forces and others.
[00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:22.545]  And we had a state senator actually on last year.
[00:13:22.545 --> 00:13:23.646]  Burgess.
[00:13:23.646 --> 00:13:25.366]  You can go pull up that Republican senator.
[00:13:25.366 --> 00:13:26.167]  Just go to YouTube.
[00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:27.487]  Alex Jones, Burgess.
[00:13:27.487 --> 00:13:28.168]  What's his first name?
[00:13:29.045 --> 00:13:30.166]  Michael Burgess.
[00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:36.210]  And he said, yes, secretly, martial law has been declared on the border.
[00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.631]  This was over a year ago now.
[00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:38.612]  This was in early 2009.
[00:13:38.612 --> 00:13:42.595]  And he said there's secret military operations.
[00:13:42.595 --> 00:13:49.259]  Now, in December, that came out in the Dallas Morning News and San Antonio Express News and Houston Chronicle.
[00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:56.264]  It's a martial law situation in Arizona and Texas, not in New Mexico or California.
[00:13:56.264 --> 00:13:58.206]  Martial law has been declared on the border.
[00:13:59.202 --> 00:14:05.324]  And they are engaged in military operations down there.
[00:14:05.324 --> 00:14:06.325]  Killing.
[00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:07.765]  Allowing Mexican troops.
[00:14:07.765 --> 00:14:09.586]  Talk about a precedent.
[00:14:09.586 --> 00:14:18.789]  And I remember when Judicial Watch in 2007 sued to get the secret treaty between Vicente Fox, George Bush and Martin of Canada.
[00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:24.817]  And this is in my film, Endgame, but it's on judicialwatch.org's website if you want to read it.
[00:14:24.817 --> 00:14:32.400]  And they said, we'll use security threats, flu threats, and financial threats as a way to merge Mexico, Canada, and the U.S.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:46.724]  And I have right here in my hands NLE09, FEMA exercise, national level exercise, saying this year the United States welcomes participation of Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, in quote, taking on American terrorists.
[00:14:47.813 --> 00:14:52.954]  Now I have a new secret FEMA document that they're threatening newspapers to remove.
[00:14:54.224 --> 00:14:58.326]  of NLE 010 that deals with nukes going off in U.S.
[00:14:58.326 --> 00:15:03.029]  cities, right as Obama says the number one threat is nukes going off.
[00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:08.092]  See, the feds, the intel we've got, aren't planning to do another Oklahoma City.
[00:15:08.092 --> 00:15:16.677]  They are seriously considering to finish their revolution against the American people, the offshore banks that want to collectivize our wealth and transfer it offshore.
[00:15:16.677 --> 00:15:18.898]  The commies are the bankers, boys.
[00:15:18.898 --> 00:15:23.141]  They are considering a nuke attack or two nuke attacks in the U.S.
[00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:27.761]  Now, I mean, I want you to understand something.
[00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:29.983]  Limbaugh is even talking about this now.
[00:15:29.983 --> 00:15:32.244]  We're going to be covering that coming up.
[00:15:32.244 --> 00:15:37.948]  So, and he represents a large echelon of the establishment, but not this offshore group.
[00:15:37.948 --> 00:15:41.990]  So you've got an internal fight inside the military, inside the media.
[00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.612]  I mean, look, America is about to die.
[00:15:44.612 --> 00:15:48.835]  If Obama's people can set off a nuke in the U.S., he'll be able to set up a dictatorship.
[00:15:50.086 --> 00:15:53.767]  Now, we got Mexican troops operating inside the U.S.
[00:15:53.767 --> 00:15:55.707]  killing people under U.S.
[00:15:55.707 --> 00:15:56.228]  control.
[00:15:56.228 --> 00:15:58.368]  I mean, the treason is getting worse and worse.
[00:15:58.368 --> 00:16:00.389]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:02.669]  They helped to create a new world order.
[00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:05.090]  We are part of a new world order.
[00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.291]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:13.412]  Invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:16:13.412 --> 00:16:17.593]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:16:17.913 --> 00:16:20.255]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:16:20.255 --> 00:16:22.798]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:26.061]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:33.648]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:16:33.988 --> 00:16:39.369]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:16:39.369 --> 00:16:41.689]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:45.910]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:46.990]  And I got news for you.
[00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.330]  You're everyone else.
[00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.831]  Invisible Empire.

[00:18:08.451 --> 00:18:13.794]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[00:19:00.874 --> 00:19:03.896]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:19:03.896 --> 00:19:09.219]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:19:09.219 --> 00:19:11.260]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.263]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:19:16.263 --> 00:19:17.443]  How much do you want?
[00:19:17.443 --> 00:19:18.184]  When do you want it?
[00:19:18.564 --> 00:19:20.445]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:19:20.445 --> 00:19:21.525]  When will you need it?
[00:19:21.525 --> 00:19:23.726]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:25.066]  Will there be any food?
[00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:26.587]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:19:26.587 --> 00:19:31.869]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:19:31.869 --> 00:19:34.990]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:39.253]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:19:39.253 --> 00:19:40.494]  How much will you need?
[00:19:40.494 --> 00:19:41.395]  We don't know.
[00:19:41.395 --> 00:19:42.496]  How much do you want?
[00:19:42.496 --> 00:19:43.416]  All you can get.
[00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:44.517]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.580]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.341]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:19:49.341 --> 00:19:50.262]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:20:01.212 --> 00:20:02.755]  Coast to coast.
[00:20:02.755 --> 00:20:04.818]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.818 --> 00:20:08.024]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:17.014 --> 00:20:18.615]  We are back live.
[00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:20.476]  All this news ties together.
[00:20:20.476 --> 00:20:22.596]  The FEMA exercises.
[00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:22.977]  U.S.
[00:20:22.977 --> 00:20:25.398]  and Mexican troops in the U.S.
[00:20:25.398 --> 00:20:28.159]  killing drug dealers in cold blood.
[00:20:28.159 --> 00:20:29.199]  Completely illegal.
[00:20:29.199 --> 00:20:32.381]  Because if they can set the precedent for them, they can do it to anybody.
[00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:35.149]  This is how the British brought down China.
[00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:41.454]  This is how they use drug wars to undermine, take over the criminal gangs, and take over society.
[00:20:41.454 --> 00:20:50.099]  It ties in with Bill Clinton saying, I sure hope we don't have to have a terror attack in America to stop these tea parties with Wolf Blitzer.
[00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:54.222]  And Limbaugh's come out and said it's an open threat to demonize the American people.
[00:20:54.222 --> 00:20:57.304]  Michael Savage is saying they may stage a terror attack.
[00:20:57.304 --> 00:20:59.365]  So it's not just Alex Jones saying it.
[00:20:59.365 --> 00:21:00.266]  Let's get that clear.
[00:21:00.266 --> 00:21:02.628]  People are finally starting to tell the truth.
[00:21:03.889 --> 00:21:08.292]  There's open calls to shut down talk radio coming out of the White House and coming out of the U.S.
[00:21:08.292 --> 00:21:08.993]  Senate.
[00:21:08.993 --> 00:21:10.574]  I mean, we're in danger.
[00:21:10.574 --> 00:21:14.797]  There's the Cybersecurity Act openly saying they may shut off the web as we know it.
[00:21:14.797 --> 00:21:15.898]  This is real.
[00:21:15.898 --> 00:21:16.559]  This is happening.
[00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:22.003]  Now, let me just cover this piece by piece because I keep mixing it all together because I've got all this incredible intel here.
[00:21:22.003 --> 00:21:25.286]  I'm going to walk through each section of it.
[00:21:25.286 --> 00:21:27.067]  But let me just put this out now.
[00:21:27.067 --> 00:21:30.550]  So everything I know, minus the exact county,
[00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:35.280]  That this has been going on.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.162]  Let me just, right now, get this information out so I'm safe.
[00:21:39.162 --> 00:21:44.924]  Because once this is out, I don't like having this type of information.
[00:21:44.924 --> 00:21:48.105]  This is from law enforcement and military.
[00:21:48.105 --> 00:21:51.006]  Okay?
[00:21:51.006 --> 00:21:51.786]  This is what happens.
[00:21:55.822 --> 00:21:56.703]  And other U.S.
[00:21:56.703 --> 00:22:03.688]  forces go into South and West Texas border towns.
[00:22:03.688 --> 00:22:08.592]  They drive in in SUVs in plain clothes.
[00:22:08.592 --> 00:22:11.835]  Separately, Air Forces helicopters land.
[00:22:11.835 --> 00:22:13.816]  They land in civilian clothes.
[00:22:13.816 --> 00:22:15.918]  Local law enforcement guards the U.S.
[00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:17.499]  helicopters.
[00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:20.301]  They then go stay at hotels.
[00:22:20.301 --> 00:22:22.043]  They then meet up in the field.
[00:22:23.391 --> 00:22:44.697]  In plain clothes, but with combat gear, but unmarked, and sometimes they wear police uniforms, police special weapons and tactics uniforms, and they go out on hunter-killer operations, killing, and listen, I want the Austin American Statesman and the Dallas Morning News and the Houston Chronicle and others, this is not a joke.
[00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:49.799]  If you get up off your fat butts and go research this, this is going to be in the news.
[00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:51.760]  And I'll be a lot safer once it's in the news.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.880]  I have to cover the facts.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.760]  And the U.S.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.241]  forces run surveillance.
[00:22:58.241 --> 00:23:14.505]  They have trained the Mexican Navy with Mexican Marines with helicopters to go in and basically kill anybody they want on the Texas
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:28.306]  and arizona side but the intel i've got specifically on texas but i'm told it's an arizona as well now remember you heard this three four months ago here on air than a month ago it came out sheriff mexican helicopter crosses in the u.s.
[00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:44.733]  airspace mexican navy aircraft with marines hanging out of the doors that's the monitor uh... to the san antonio express news houston chronicle uh... here's another one k r g v t v mexican military helicopter spotted over texas so see this is all out there uh... here is the the boston globe
[00:23:45.553 --> 00:23:52.578]  As Gates met with top Colombian officials, the Pentagon hosted a meeting with top military leaders of Colombia and Mexico to help foster cooperation.
[00:23:52.578 --> 00:23:55.781]  Mexican helicopter pilots are being trained in Colombia as a U.S.
[00:23:55.781 --> 00:24:01.525]  finance training center, while the United States is also facilitating training of Peruvian Marines in Colombia.
[00:24:01.525 --> 00:24:04.567]  So you can search and find pieces of this.
[00:24:04.567 --> 00:24:11.152]  But the issue is, it's illegal for an Iranian leader to pay an assassin to try to kill Obama.
[00:24:11.152 --> 00:24:12.333]  Or Bush, or anybody else.
[00:24:14.389 --> 00:24:20.807]  It's also illegal when Pat Robertson calls for our government to kill Hugo Chavez.
[00:24:20.807 --> 00:24:21.590]  You can't do this.
[00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.091]  It's illegal.
[00:24:23.533 --> 00:24:25.234]  Okay, that's the law.
[00:24:25.234 --> 00:24:29.476]  And it's just as illegal for supposed people coming across the border.
[00:24:29.476 --> 00:24:34.759]  You know I'm for shutting the border down and deporting people and prosecuting companies that hire illegals.
[00:24:34.759 --> 00:24:36.980]  Nobody's stronger on this than me.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.200]  But this is separate.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:44.784]  And again, when you then have the SPP, Security and Prosperity Partnership documents, you then know
[00:24:46.397 --> 00:24:50.520]  Just like at the Olympics in Canada a few months ago, for the Winter Olympics, they had U.S.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.942]  forces there.
[00:24:51.942 --> 00:24:56.465]  And you read NLEO-9 and NLEO-10 documents from FEMA.
[00:24:56.465 --> 00:24:58.547]  This has been in the Christian Science Monitor and AP.
[00:24:58.547 --> 00:25:00.169]  I mean, I'm not just saying this.
[00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:03.171]  I'm going to go over these articles coming up in the next segment.
[00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:09.657]  They are saying they'll use, quote, Mexican and Canadian troops to, quote, fight American terrorists, foreign or domestic.
[00:25:09.657 --> 00:25:13.380]  So what they're doing is they're breaking the ice with the troops and the Border Patrol.
[00:25:14.744 --> 00:25:20.127]  To work with Mexican troops and then be involved in serious felonies.
[00:25:20.127 --> 00:25:21.707]  I mean, it's illegal.
[00:25:21.707 --> 00:25:32.613]  And so you've got, just like we had 4,000 plus troops that died from 1959 to 1964 before we officially had combat operations in Vietnam with the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:25:33.433 --> 00:25:36.555]  We lost 4,000 plus troops as quote advisors.
[00:25:36.555 --> 00:25:40.037]  There is a war going on in Mexico.
[00:25:40.037 --> 00:25:44.941]  17,000 dead in the last year just on the US-Mexican border.
[00:25:44.941 --> 00:25:48.583]  17,000 plus.
[00:25:48.583 --> 00:25:51.065]  There's a full-scale war going on.
[00:25:51.065 --> 00:25:56.688]  And I know the average person only cares about the Spurs, basketball, the Dallas Cowboys, stadium getting demolished or whatever.
[00:25:56.688 --> 00:26:00.331]  But people, you better understand, especially living in Texas,
[00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:04.708]  This is dangerous for everybody.
[00:26:04.708 --> 00:26:08.661]  And the police are scared to death of the real drug cartels and most of them work for our own government.
[00:26:11.658 --> 00:26:19.963]  And so you've got Mexican Marines, let's be clear, and Army, but in this particular case, Mexican Marines.
[00:26:19.963 --> 00:26:23.825]  Mexican Marines in the U.S.
[00:26:23.825 --> 00:26:29.768]  killing Mexicans coming across the border, just wiping them out, killing them, with U.S.
[00:26:29.768 --> 00:26:35.311]  helicopters and Mexican helicopters in the air, running the surveillance along with drones.
[00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:38.673]  We told you a year ago there were drones, last month they admitted there's drones everywhere.
[00:26:38.993 --> 00:26:45.894]  There is a full-scale war going on now on the U.S.-Mexican border.
[00:26:45.894 --> 00:26:50.715]  And it's completely secret and illegal.
[00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:58.537]  And this is absolute... I mean, I got this from one source a few weeks ago, and I don't go with one source on something this big.
[00:26:58.537 --> 00:27:04.718]  And then, in my lap, this falls directly from the U.S.
[00:27:04.718 --> 00:27:05.298]  military.
[00:27:05.298 --> 00:27:07.339]  Directly from the U.S.
[00:27:07.339 --> 00:27:07.819]  military.
[00:27:08.675 --> 00:27:14.683]  Okay, this is going on, this is happening, this is illegal.
[00:27:14.683 --> 00:27:21.913]  And if it's Texas and Arizona today, it'll be Illinois, it'll be New York State tomorrow.
[00:27:21.913 --> 00:27:23.576]  It'll be Oregon tomorrow.
[00:27:25.373 --> 00:27:27.335]  And they've got agreements to use Mexican and U.S.
[00:27:27.335 --> 00:27:31.438]  troops in Canada, and Canadian and Mexican troops here, and U.S.
[00:27:31.438 --> 00:27:34.020]  and Canadian troops with Mexicans in Mexico.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.721]  I mean, this is the North American Union.
[00:27:35.721 --> 00:27:47.071]  And they said, through crises, military crises, and biological crises, and economic crises, we're going to merge the security apparatus of these three nations.
[00:27:48.206 --> 00:27:54.250]  The three nations having over 430 million people in them.
[00:27:54.250 --> 00:28:00.133]  310 million in the U.S., what is it, 27 million in Canada, 25 million, and 100 million in Mexico.
[00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:00.953]  Do the math.
[00:28:00.953 --> 00:28:03.915]  The issue here is so huge.
[00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:07.077]  And look, the big newspapers, they're getting this intel.
[00:28:07.077 --> 00:28:08.618]  Their editors don't let them run with it.
[00:28:08.618 --> 00:28:09.198]  They're controlled.
[00:28:13.854 --> 00:28:17.175]  Remember, I told you there were thousands of deaths going on every year five, six years ago.
[00:28:17.175 --> 00:28:18.675]  I mean, how did I know that?
[00:28:18.675 --> 00:28:23.636]  There were State Department issuances, reports, saying don't go to Mexico.
[00:28:23.636 --> 00:28:25.916]  I talked to one of my crew here, one of the sales guys.
[00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:29.377]  He went down there for his honeymoon to Cancun.
[00:28:29.377 --> 00:28:31.657]  He said it looked like an armed camp.
[00:28:31.657 --> 00:28:36.318]  Now that's down on the Yucatan Peninsula in southern Mexico, close to the border with Guatemala.
[00:28:36.318 --> 00:28:37.958]  Okay.
[00:28:37.958 --> 00:28:39.259]  Okay.
[00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:40.239]  That's what's going on there.
[00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:42.642]  You heard it here first.
[00:28:42.642 --> 00:28:50.433]  When we come back, is the Pentagon and the foreign banks that run America going to stage a nuke attack in America?
[00:28:50.433 --> 00:28:51.714]  Are they going to do that?
[00:28:51.714 --> 00:28:54.078]  We will cover it on the other side.
[00:28:54.078 --> 00:28:57.622]  This information is vital to the future of this republic.
[00:28:57.622 --> 00:28:58.443]  Please stay with us.
[00:28:58.443 --> 00:28:59.325]  Call your friends and family.
[00:29:01.738 --> 00:29:10.223]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[00:29:10.223 --> 00:29:21.130]  As of January 1st, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:26.554]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[00:29:27.094 --> 00:29:31.997]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[00:29:31.997 --> 00:29:41.063]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[00:29:41.063 --> 00:29:51.190]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.853]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:29:54.853 --> 00:29:55.893]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:30:00.497 --> 00:30:01.798]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:01.798 --> 00:30:07.383]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:07.383 --> 00:30:12.407]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:12.407 --> 00:30:17.451]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:30:17.971 --> 00:30:23.193]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:23.193 --> 00:30:25.514]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:30:25.514 --> 00:30:30.315]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:30.315 --> 00:30:31.436]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:31.436 --> 00:30:34.497]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:30:34.497 --> 00:30:37.798]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:38.118 --> 00:30:41.300]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.521]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:30:43.521 --> 00:30:44.401]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:44.401 --> 00:30:44.641]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:44.641 --> 00:30:48.103]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:48.103 --> 00:30:49.864]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:07.294]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:31:07.294 --> 00:31:12.438]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:31:12.438 --> 00:31:21.165]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:21.165 --> 00:31:25.228]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:31:25.228 --> 00:31:27.190]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:34.264]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:31:34.264 --> 00:31:38.067]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:31:38.067 --> 00:31:39.328]  Others don't.
[00:31:39.328 --> 00:31:41.469]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.469 --> 00:31:43.251]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:43.251 --> 00:31:46.133]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:31:46.133 --> 00:31:50.376]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:31:50.376 --> 00:31:52.758]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:31:52.758 --> 00:31:55.460]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.822]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:31:57.822 --> 00:31:58.703]  Others don't.
[00:32:02.126 --> 00:32:04.268]  You're subject to other police action.
[00:32:04.268 --> 00:32:05.529]  Tyranny is here.
[00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:09.471]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:32:09.471 --> 00:32:11.713]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:32:11.713 --> 00:32:17.577]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:32:17.577 --> 00:32:23.802]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:32:24.222 --> 00:32:30.225]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:32:30.225 --> 00:32:34.386]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:32:34.386 --> 00:32:38.688]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:32:38.688 --> 00:32:44.630]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:48.192]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:32:48.192 --> 00:32:50.153]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:32:50.153 --> 00:32:50.593]  It's here.

[00:33:01.423 --> 00:33:02.965]  Coast to Coast.
[00:33:02.965 --> 00:33:05.027]  Direct from Austin.
[00:33:05.027 --> 00:33:08.210]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:16.963 --> 00:33:17.583]  The U.S.
[00:33:17.583 --> 00:33:23.145]  government is now saying they may give hundreds of thousands of Mexicans asylum from the drug violence.
[00:33:23.145 --> 00:33:24.666]  Here's the New York Times.
[00:33:24.666 --> 00:33:27.607]  Fleeing drug violence, Mexicans pour into U.S.
[00:33:27.607 --> 00:33:29.707]  New York Times.
[00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:30.328]  Here's another one.
[00:33:30.328 --> 00:33:33.289]  Arizona ranchers caught up in Mexican drug violence.
[00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:35.589]  They're killing ranchers and murdering them.
[00:33:35.589 --> 00:33:39.611]  Like Arizona Farming and Ranching Hall of Fame Michael Rolls.
[00:33:42.671 --> 00:33:44.952]  Okay, I'm not going to get into that anymore.
[00:33:44.952 --> 00:33:47.113]  It's just shocking to me.
[00:33:47.113 --> 00:33:48.013]  I know there's drones.
[00:33:48.013 --> 00:33:49.734]  I know there's Mexican troops on our side.
[00:33:49.734 --> 00:33:52.035]  I know many times they fire at U.S.
[00:33:52.035 --> 00:33:52.415]  troops.
[00:33:52.415 --> 00:33:53.335]  That's been in the news.
[00:33:53.335 --> 00:33:55.556]  They fire at FBI agents.
[00:33:55.556 --> 00:33:58.357]  They've killed FBI agents in California.
[00:33:58.357 --> 00:34:01.238]  They're attacking police in California.
[00:34:01.238 --> 00:34:02.459]  They're firing on ranchers.
[00:34:02.459 --> 00:34:03.959]  They're burning their houses down.
[00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:06.540]  On video, Mexican troops, Mexican Army.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:10.262]  Now Mexican Marines trained at the School of Americas
[00:34:11.556 --> 00:34:19.279]  And at other bases are running around Texas and Arizona with U.S.
[00:34:19.279 --> 00:34:25.061]  Army backing them up, killing people that are coming across the border, supposed cartels.
[00:34:25.061 --> 00:34:27.682]  I mean, no judge, no jury, just an executioner.
[00:34:27.682 --> 00:34:29.683]  And you're not hearing about it.
[00:34:30.447 --> 00:34:31.928]  When will you hear about it?
[00:34:31.928 --> 00:34:32.688]  I don't know.
[00:34:32.688 --> 00:34:35.569]  Sooner is better than later.
[00:34:35.569 --> 00:34:41.991]  Obviously, if the media, the mainstream media that's dying would do their job and cover real news, you wouldn't be dying.
[00:34:41.991 --> 00:34:45.733]  We're doubling the amount of listeners we have every six months now, not every year.
[00:34:45.733 --> 00:34:45.993]  Why?
[00:34:45.993 --> 00:34:50.135]  Because we're getting all the same stuff our media is getting.
[00:34:50.135 --> 00:34:58.478]  Our media is a bunch of stupid cowards that sit there and read press releases the government gives them.
[00:34:58.478 --> 00:34:58.818]  Not me.
[00:35:00.882 --> 00:35:03.386]  I use the brain God gave me and I cover the facts.
[00:35:03.386 --> 00:35:07.271]  Now, let me shift gears, but this all ties together.
[00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:12.018]  And when we start the next hour, I'm going to tie it all together and then take calls for the balance of the broadcast.
[00:35:18.149 --> 00:35:19.910]  I have interviewed the lawyers involved.
[00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.932]  I have read the federal affidavits and declassified documents.
[00:35:22.932 --> 00:35:25.914]  It has been in even the Associated Press.
[00:35:25.914 --> 00:35:31.578]  It has been in both of the Salt Lake Papers, because that's where one of the court hearings was two years ago.
[00:35:31.578 --> 00:35:34.240]  Jesse Trinidad, the lawyer.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.881]  McVeigh was U.S.
[00:35:35.881 --> 00:35:41.925]  Special Operations, and we've got video of him a year after he was supposedly out of the military at a demolitions base.
[00:35:41.925 --> 00:35:43.125]  We have photos of Camp
[00:35:45.114 --> 00:35:48.756]  Grouper with the Ryder truck being loaded with ammonium nitrate.
[00:35:48.756 --> 00:35:51.899]  That's in my first film, 1997, America's Choice by Design.
[00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:54.881]  We had a local newscast where there were unexploded bombs inside.
[00:35:54.881 --> 00:35:56.282]  The building was blown out, not in.
[00:35:56.282 --> 00:36:01.265]  The ATF showed up a minute after, telling police and medics that they were on the ninth floor.
[00:36:01.265 --> 00:36:02.306]  The police laughed at them.
[00:36:02.306 --> 00:36:07.569]  Terrence Yakey, cop of the year in Oklahoma City that year, dragging people out, started investigating it.
[00:36:07.569 --> 00:36:10.031]  They tortured him to death and murdered him.
[00:36:10.031 --> 00:36:11.972]  He called his partner and said, Feds are following me.
[00:36:11.972 --> 00:36:12.753]  They're pulling me over.
[00:36:13.393 --> 00:36:15.074]  Then they found him tortured and dead.
[00:36:15.074 --> 00:36:21.896]  I mean, the problem is, even getting into Oklahoma City, I could do two, three, four hours just going over the documents.
[00:36:21.896 --> 00:36:25.757]  But if you haven't researched it, that was a government operation.
[00:36:25.757 --> 00:36:31.759]  That building was bombed because 30-plus states were moving to declare Tenth Amendment sovereignty.
[00:36:31.759 --> 00:36:35.600]  They were saying no to the feds, no to Bill Clinton's anti-gun initiative.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.521]  There was a rebellion at the state level.
[00:36:39.082 --> 00:36:43.825]  And so the Feds, controlled by offshore banks, came in and staged that bombing.
[00:36:43.825 --> 00:36:50.509]  And within minutes of the bombing happening, Bill Clinton came out and blamed Rush Limbaugh on talk radio and conservatives in America.
[00:36:50.509 --> 00:36:52.710]  Asinine.
[00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:58.093]  And I know you remember that, listeners.
[00:36:58.093 --> 00:37:01.135]  So amazing this is happening again.
[00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:05.918]  Now, we have that backdrop.
[00:37:08.433 --> 00:37:11.716]  Obama has committed political suicide.
[00:37:11.716 --> 00:37:27.910]  The health care plan, people are discovering that it doesn't give you coverage, it doesn't cover pre-existing, that it's a payoff, as Lord Monckton said on the show on Friday, that it is a payoff to the insurance companies, it is an offshore banking looting that's going on.
[00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.071]  Ron Paul is on record.
[00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:30.152]  That fact is out there.
[00:37:31.327 --> 00:37:36.751]  Obama has continued the wars, the torture of the secret arrest, hiring more lobbies than any other president.
[00:37:36.751 --> 00:37:38.772]  All these Democrats thought they were going to get a free ride.
[00:37:38.772 --> 00:37:39.553]  They haven't gotten it.
[00:37:39.553 --> 00:37:41.494]  He's got the lowest approval rating of any president in U.S.
[00:37:41.494 --> 00:37:42.154]  history.
[00:37:42.154 --> 00:37:44.816]  He's spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[00:37:44.816 --> 00:37:45.737]  He's in deep trouble.
[00:37:45.737 --> 00:37:47.098]  So are the Democrats.
[00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.539]  What is the only political card they can play?
[00:37:49.539 --> 00:37:50.840]  Stage crises.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.801]  We played last week.
[00:37:51.801 --> 00:37:53.302]  Rush Limbaugh saying it.
[00:37:53.302 --> 00:37:55.183]  Michael Savage is saying it again.
[00:37:55.183 --> 00:38:00.046]  Anyone who has any political smarts can see that the system needs this.
[00:38:01.387 --> 00:38:03.809]  As we broke, and again, pay attention to us.
[00:38:03.809 --> 00:38:06.071]  It isn't, oh, we broke this, aren't we cool?
[00:38:06.071 --> 00:38:07.231]  It's this is life and death.
[00:38:07.231 --> 00:38:14.337]  You better remember that on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, in early April,
[00:38:15.583 --> 00:38:29.491]  And even in late March, we wrote articles identifying the anarchist Ford Foundation and government-funded, Democratic Party-funded websites that said, we're going to have racist signs, and we're going to go to the Tea Parties, and we're going to pose as racist.
[00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:32.553]  Well, we already know that was going on before, but now they're admitting it.
[00:38:32.553 --> 00:38:37.555]  Now it's finally been in the Associated Press as of last Monday.
[00:38:37.555 --> 00:38:42.118]  So it's confirmed, mainstream news, some of the people are getting in trouble that were involved in it.
[00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:55.803]  Now, then, as if that wasn't clear enough, Bill Clinton goes on CNN Friday and gave two speeches last week saying, gee, I hope there isn't a terror attack.
[00:38:55.803 --> 00:39:02.968]  I hope that isn't what we need to show everybody that these Tea Parties are bad and out of control.
[00:39:02.968 --> 00:39:04.669]  And then he just sat down and shut up.
[00:39:04.669 --> 00:39:10.713]  Now, key bono, Latin for who benefits, who stands to gain, who has the motive.
[00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:16.691]  Government-staged terror attacks.
[00:39:16.691 --> 00:39:20.712]  That has been declassified hundreds of times.
[00:39:20.712 --> 00:39:26.254]  And conservatives out there that don't want to look at 9-11, well you better look at Bill Clinton and the Democrats.
[00:39:26.254 --> 00:39:28.174]  You better look at Barack Obama.
[00:39:28.174 --> 00:39:30.075]  You better grow up.
[00:39:30.075 --> 00:39:34.196]  Because they are now out in the open preparing to frame us.
[00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:41.273]  Crash the Tea Party to infiltrate April 15th anti-tax protest.
[00:39:41.273 --> 00:39:45.355]  Even Rick Perry put a press release out Friday warning of Democrat dirty tricks.
[00:39:45.355 --> 00:39:49.818]  Southern Poverty Law Center declares Ron Paul and Napolitano extremist.
[00:39:49.818 --> 00:39:51.519]  So now they're bad.
[00:39:51.519 --> 00:39:52.520]  Experts.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.361]  Angry rhetoric protected but can be disturbing.
[00:39:55.361 --> 00:39:58.883]  CNN.
[00:39:58.883 --> 00:40:01.985]  Recalling 95 bombing, Clinton sees parallels.
[00:40:01.985 --> 00:40:02.786]  New York Times.
[00:40:05.799 --> 00:40:10.204]  Here's the Infowars.com boil-down article from today with Kurt Nemo.
[00:40:10.204 --> 00:40:11.826]  False flag prelude.
[00:40:11.826 --> 00:40:17.532]  Clinton launches demonization campaign on OKCity bombing anniversary.
[00:40:17.532 --> 00:40:19.474]  We've got the video there.
[00:40:19.474 --> 00:40:20.636]  Here's another one.
[00:40:20.636 --> 00:40:24.140]  LA white supremacy rally gets bloody.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:24.480]  NBC.
[00:40:25.737 --> 00:40:31.881]  How many white supremacist groups have been caught, like Hal Turner two months ago, being FBI agents?
[00:40:31.881 --> 00:40:36.864]  They do that to demonize legitimate political dissent in America.
[00:40:36.864 --> 00:40:40.546]  Clinton alludes to the 95 bombing, says words matter.
[00:40:40.546 --> 00:40:49.251]  So he's blaming anyone criticizing the government with the 95 bombing and saying, I hope it doesn't happen again.
[00:40:49.251 --> 00:40:53.014]  Let's play this short clip of Bill Clinton on Wolf Blitzer Friday.
[00:40:53.014 --> 00:40:53.394]  Here it is.
[00:40:55.987 --> 00:41:21.446]  Well, I think that in fairness to the public officials that were the main victims here and their families, I think that we've done a much better job over the last 15 years of preparing for it and guarding against it and trying to be alert to the most extreme members of groups that advocate violence, for example.
[00:41:22.367 --> 00:41:25.029]  But I think the circumstances have a lot of parallels.
[00:41:25.029 --> 00:41:31.512]  For example, there's the same kind of economic and social upheaval now than there was then.
[00:41:31.512 --> 00:41:40.837]  I'd say in 1993, the economy for most, you know, average people who were likely to be drawn into this was not quite as bad as it is today.
[00:41:40.837 --> 00:41:42.899]  But the social upheaval was even greater.
[00:41:42.899 --> 00:41:48.622]  There was more crime, there was more gang violence, there was more sense of disintegration after the Cold War.
[00:41:49.102 --> 00:41:53.724]  The hatred that Timothy McVeigh, that he had.
[00:41:53.724 --> 00:41:54.244]  There are others.
[00:41:54.244 --> 00:41:55.785]  There are plenty of people like that right now.
[00:41:55.785 --> 00:41:56.926]  Lots of them.
[00:41:56.926 --> 00:42:02.048]  Do you feel it's more intense today and it's greater today than it was 15 years ago?
[00:42:02.048 --> 00:42:14.114]  I can't say, but I will... There were... Oklahoma City was the last of a series of very high-profile violent encounters.
[00:42:16.249 --> 00:42:18.772]  Uh, at least the last high-profile one.
[00:42:18.772 --> 00:42:20.653]  We've had several since.
[00:42:20.653 --> 00:42:29.182]  And now there are all these groups, uh, you know, saying things like, the current political debate is just a prelude to civil war, and all of that kind of stuff.
[00:42:29.182 --> 00:42:39.351]  But, you know, there was a lot of that tough stuff back then, that Gordon Liddy was on the radio telling people if the ATF agents came to be sure and take a headshot at them because they had, you know... Alright, stay there!
[00:42:40.112 --> 00:42:40.752]  Stay there.
[00:42:40.752 --> 00:42:41.913]  We're going to pause it.
[00:42:41.913 --> 00:42:45.875]  When we come back, he says, I hope we don't have to have another Oklahoma City.
[00:42:45.875 --> 00:42:46.836]  Get ready.
[00:42:46.836 --> 00:42:50.177]  We're going to break down nuclear terrorism inside the U.S.
[00:42:50.177 --> 00:42:54.900]  and the other type of terror attacks that the establishment is clearly preparing to stage.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.021]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:57.021 --> 00:42:59.142]  PrisonPlanet.tv and fullwars.com.
[00:43:01.138 --> 00:43:04.162]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:43:04.162 --> 00:43:09.488]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:43:09.488 --> 00:43:11.531]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:43:11.531 --> 00:43:16.537]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:43:16.537 --> 00:43:17.719]  How much do you want?
[00:43:17.719 --> 00:43:18.460]  When do you want it?
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.723]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:43:20.723 --> 00:43:21.784]  When will you need it?
[00:43:21.784 --> 00:43:23.987]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:43:23.987 --> 00:43:25.329]  Will there be any food?
[00:43:25.329 --> 00:43:26.871]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:32.138]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:43:32.138 --> 00:43:35.263]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:43:35.703 --> 00:43:39.527]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:43:39.527 --> 00:43:40.748]  How much will you need?
[00:43:40.748 --> 00:43:41.669]  We don't know.
[00:43:41.669 --> 00:43:42.770]  How much do you want?
[00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:43.510]  All you can get.
[00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:44.791]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:47.834]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:49.616]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:43:49.616 --> 00:43:50.537]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:44:00.461 --> 00:44:01.623]  What's your home worth?
[00:44:01.623 --> 00:44:03.725]  How can you compare local real estate agents?
[00:44:03.725 --> 00:44:06.769]  And how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[00:44:06.769 --> 00:44:14.499]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[00:44:14.499 --> 00:44:17.923]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.

[00:44:59.955 --> 00:45:02.276]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:45:02.276 --> 00:45:04.658]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:45:04.658 --> 00:45:07.859]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:45:07.859 --> 00:45:12.982]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:45:12.982 --> 00:45:17.505]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:45:17.505 --> 00:45:19.946]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:45:19.946 --> 00:45:22.387]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:25.229]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:45:25.629 --> 00:45:33.571]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:45:33.571 --> 00:45:38.953]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:45:38.953 --> 00:45:41.274]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:45:41.274 --> 00:45:45.215]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:45:45.515 --> 00:45:46.577]  And I got news for you.
[00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:47.899]  You're everyone else.
[00:45:47.899 --> 00:45:49.421]  Invisible Empire.

[00:45:59.858 --> 00:46:01.179]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:01.179 --> 00:46:06.762]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:46:06.762 --> 00:46:11.764]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:46:11.764 --> 00:46:17.347]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:46:17.347 --> 00:46:19.168]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[00:46:19.448 --> 00:46:19.948]  We're good to go!
[00:46:47.478 --> 00:46:51.702]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:46:51.702 --> 00:46:56.526]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:46:56.526 --> 00:47:01.370]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:08.176]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:17.725 --> 00:47:23.750]  We know elements of the federal government were involved in the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:27.052]  We know it was used to demonize their political opposition.
[00:47:27.052 --> 00:47:34.818]  We know the Democratic Party has lied and said that their members of the Congressional Black Caucus were spit on and called the N-word.
[00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.059]  Now all the video's been released.
[00:47:36.059 --> 00:47:37.059]  Not true.
[00:47:37.059 --> 00:47:38.560]  We know they've dispatched their people.
[00:47:39.381 --> 00:47:40.042]  We're good to go.
[00:47:52.142 --> 00:48:01.091]  And division in America to get everybody at each other's throats because the last thing they want is the American people, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, getting together.
[00:48:01.091 --> 00:48:04.114]  So they basically say there shouldn't be any black people at tea parties.
[00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:06.236]  And if there are, they ask, why are you here?
[00:48:06.236 --> 00:48:07.497]  This is racist.
[00:48:07.497 --> 00:48:08.898]  That is out in the open.
[00:48:09.759 --> 00:48:11.621]  Psychological warfare.
[00:48:11.621 --> 00:48:18.949]  And now we have Bill Clinton saying, gee I hope it doesn't take another Oklahoma City to shut all this down.
[00:48:18.949 --> 00:48:25.356]  He told USA Today in 1996 on Air Force One, they said what saved your candidacy for the 2000 and for the 1996 election?
[00:48:29.528 --> 00:48:30.289]  Second election.
[00:48:30.289 --> 00:48:31.670]  He said Oklahoma City.
[00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:33.271]  It rallied the country together.
[00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:35.513]  They stand to gain from it.
[00:48:35.513 --> 00:48:36.874]  And here's the Washington Times.
[00:48:36.874 --> 00:48:37.334]  Critics.
[00:48:37.334 --> 00:48:41.157]  Obama administration hyping terrorist nuclear threat.
[00:48:41.157 --> 00:48:48.923]  He's now saying it's the biggest threat, bigger than nation-to-nation nuclear war, that terrorists are going to sneak nukes in.
[00:48:48.923 --> 00:48:53.947]  And they're claiming that the American people are supposedly working with Al Qaeda.
[00:48:53.947 --> 00:48:55.127]  How asinine is that?
[00:48:55.988 --> 00:48:57.370]  And then here's Rush Limbaugh.
[00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:01.997]  Bill Clinton links talk radio tea parties to non-existent terrorism.
[00:49:03.592 --> 00:49:04.272]  Here's another one.
[00:49:04.272 --> 00:49:04.733]  Clinton.
[00:49:04.733 --> 00:49:07.555]  Rush Limbaugh comment doesn't make any sense.
[00:49:07.555 --> 00:49:09.316]  ABC News.
[00:49:09.316 --> 00:49:15.841]  And it talks about Rush Limbaugh saying they're trying to frame conservatives with coming terror attacks.
[00:49:15.841 --> 00:49:18.303]  See, they've been hyping this and hyping this and hyping this.
[00:49:18.303 --> 00:49:28.991]  And I've told you, in April, in May, in June, that these months are key for a massive staged event to be blamed on us, or their entire agenda isn't going to pass.
[00:49:29.731 --> 00:49:31.632]  I'm not saying they're going to stage a nuke attack.
[00:49:31.632 --> 00:49:33.212]  I'm saying it's being considered.
[00:49:33.212 --> 00:49:42.134]  And remember, Governor Ridge, the head of Homeland Security, said last year in a best-selling book that they would issue fake terror alerts for political gain.
[00:49:42.134 --> 00:49:44.415]  Let's go ahead and finish up with Bill Clinton on Wolf Blitzer.
[00:49:44.415 --> 00:49:45.055]  Here it is.
[00:49:45.055 --> 00:49:49.336]  You know, saying things like, the current political debate is just a prelude to civil war.
[00:49:50.496 --> 00:49:51.477]  All of that kind of stuff.
[00:49:51.477 --> 00:49:54.079]  But you know, there was a lot of that tough stuff back then.
[00:49:54.079 --> 00:50:03.146]  That Gordon Liddy was on the radio telling people that the ATF agents came to be sure and take a head shot at them because they had, you know, um, vests on.
[00:50:03.146 --> 00:50:05.808]  They didn't seem to have much support at that time.
[00:50:05.808 --> 00:50:13.735]  Now there seems to be, at least if you go to these websites, you listen to some of this... Well that's the thing, see, it's still a minority, but they have...
[00:50:16.011 --> 00:50:19.953]  They can communicate with each other much faster and much better than ever before.
[00:50:19.953 --> 00:50:34.579]  The main thing that bothered us at the time of Oklahoma City was that already there was enough use of the internet that if you knew how to find the websites, not everybody even had a computer back then, but if you knew how to find it, you could learn, for example, how to make a bomb.
[00:50:34.579 --> 00:50:39.482]  Now, everybody's got a computer, websites are easily accessible, and
[00:50:40.422 --> 00:50:45.928]  You can be highly selective and spend all your time with people that are, you know, kind of out there with you.
[00:50:45.928 --> 00:50:51.533]  I don't want something bad to happen for us to get this thing right again.
[00:50:51.533 --> 00:50:57.900]  And as I pointed out today, we, after Oklahoma City, we kept right on having our political disagreements.
[00:50:59.093 --> 00:51:04.218]  You know, the Congressman, the Speaker, they closed the government twice in 1995.
[00:51:04.218 --> 00:51:06.500]  You remember it very well, at the end of the year.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.203]  We had an election in 1996.
[00:51:09.203 --> 00:51:10.464]  Oklahoma was a Republican state.
[00:51:10.464 --> 00:51:11.965]  I still didn't care.
[00:51:11.965 --> 00:51:15.749]  But I loved them because they reoriented me.
[00:51:15.749 --> 00:51:16.549]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:23.253]  And then he goes on to say again, I sure hope we don't have to have an attack to shut all this down and get things right again.
[00:51:23.253 --> 00:51:28.976]  Now, here is FEMA National Level Exercise 2009.
[00:51:28.976 --> 00:51:39.201]  NLEO-9 is a White House-directed, congressionally-managed exercise that includes the participation of all appropriate federal, department, and agency senior officials, deputy staff, and key operational elements.
[00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:44.184]  In addition, broad regional participation of state, tribal, local, and private sectors is anticipated.
[00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:46.065]  This year, the United States welcomes the participation
[00:51:46.465 --> 00:51:46.745]  I don't know.
[00:52:08.877 --> 00:52:12.239]  Why is FEMA trying to cover up NLEO-10?
[00:52:12.239 --> 00:52:21.925]  Public intelligence has received a request from FEMA to remove for official use only document regarding the national level exercise 2010 which was scheduled for this coming May.
[00:52:21.925 --> 00:52:27.689]  The exercise would be based on national planning scenario which simulates a nuclear detonation in the U.S.
[00:52:27.689 --> 00:52:27.969]  city.
[00:52:27.969 --> 00:52:30.271]  However, recent political pressure has led to
[00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:37.058]  The exercise being scaled back according to the Washington Post, Christian Science Monitor, and a variety of other publications.
[00:52:37.058 --> 00:52:43.606]  At the behest of Senator Harry Reid, the exercise for Las Vegas had reportedly been cancelled.
[00:52:43.606 --> 00:52:49.574]  But now in LE09, it turns out this document was put out on some county websites in Nevada.
[00:52:50.074 --> 00:52:51.914]  But now FEMA wants it taken down.
[00:52:51.914 --> 00:52:53.815]  Now what's in the FEMA document?
[00:52:53.815 --> 00:52:57.956]  You can go to InfoWars.com and link through in this article to the document.
[00:52:57.956 --> 00:52:58.956]  Here's the document.
[00:52:58.956 --> 00:53:03.718]  It says, unannounced simulated detonations of nukes in the US.
[00:53:03.718 --> 00:53:05.858]  What does that mean unannounced?
[00:53:05.858 --> 00:53:14.800]  I've been in urban warfare drills in Belton, Texas of all places, where they blow up a car and announce on the news, this is in my film Road to Tyranny, 2002, that a terrorist
[00:53:17.498 --> 00:53:18.299]  Had blown them up.
[00:53:18.299 --> 00:53:20.260]  And then a day later they announced it was a drill.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.621]  So it's psychological warfare.
[00:53:21.621 --> 00:53:27.687]  And remember, Governor Ridge said they were issuing fake terror alerts for political gain.
[00:53:27.687 --> 00:53:30.068]  Both parties do this.
[00:53:30.068 --> 00:53:31.870]  But, I mean, you talk about open and shut case.
[00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:37.334]  The fact that Oklahoma City was an inside job is not debatable.
[00:53:37.334 --> 00:53:46.122]  And so coming up in the next hour, I'm going to highlight the actual part about the nuclear scenarios that they're going to be having.
[00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:59.096]  Because I didn't highlight this, I'm looking for it, where it talks about unannounced nuclear weapons, simulated nuclear weapons detonations, but that is in here.
[00:53:59.096 --> 00:54:03.818]  And it's got comments about other secret scenarios and drills they're running.
[00:54:03.818 --> 00:54:06.839]  Why is this so important?
[00:54:06.839 --> 00:54:07.260]  Because
[00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:19.200]  On 9-11, the government ran drills of the exact same buildings being attacked at the same time, and the 9-11 tapes released from NORAD have the FAA saying, is this part of the drill or the real exercise?
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.861]  I've never seen this happen before.
[00:54:20.861 --> 00:54:25.646]  And they use that so the rest of the government and the NSA is spying on everything.
[00:54:25.646 --> 00:54:28.428]  Here's about nuclear weapons being moved into position.
[00:54:29.289 --> 00:54:38.193]  They don't go out and stop it because they think it's part of the drill, and then an outside group, a private intelligence agency, or Merck group, our foreign government, can do this.
[00:54:38.193 --> 00:54:51.120]  I mean, can you imagine what Obama's going to be able to do if they bust people with a nuke, or if they fearmonger a nuke, which they're now doing, or if they staged either a dirty bomb, or an A-bomb, or God forbid, a hydrogen bomb?
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:56.881]  Think about what this will do, and I've been telling you that's in the cards the last few years.
[00:54:56.881 --> 00:55:01.162]  We saw Cheney before the 2004 election saying we will be hit by a nuke.
[00:55:01.162 --> 00:55:02.562]  Give up all your rights.
[00:55:02.562 --> 00:55:11.324]  So we hope this is just more fear-mongering, but it may not be just fear-mongering.
[00:55:11.324 --> 00:55:13.505]  And Bill Clinton is now
[00:55:17.236 --> 00:55:26.066]  Running around all over TV, all over radio, in speeches, saying if there's a terror attack, it's the fault of the people that are criticizing the government.
[00:55:26.066 --> 00:55:33.013]  Meanwhile, we know the Democratic Party and big foundations are hiring droves of people to go to tea parties, holding up swastika signs.
[00:55:33.013 --> 00:55:34.795]  And it wasn't just groups planning it.
[00:55:34.795 --> 00:55:36.477]  I got articles that we covered on Friday on
[00:55:39.394 --> 00:55:49.683]  You know, the day after the Tea Party day, where it showed them in New Mexico, in Texas, in New York, and other places, with the big swastika signs, and the media would go over to them and say, are you really a Tea Party?
[00:55:49.683 --> 00:55:51.164]  No, I'm here to discredit them.
[00:55:51.164 --> 00:56:04.415]  I mean, so if they'll go out and dress up like Nazis to demonize anybody that doesn't want the government to take over society and have taxes rise and have us go bankrupt, if they'll do that, they will do anything.
[00:56:06.636 --> 00:56:14.345]  And talking about NLE 010, the FEMA drill, here is the Christian Science Monitor.
[00:56:14.345 --> 00:56:16.407]  Terrorist attack on Las Vegas cancelled.
[00:56:16.407 --> 00:56:19.350]  Politics are over preparedness.
[00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:26.959]  No, Obama doesn't want all these nuke drills being public because if they stage an event, they don't want people thinking about that.
[00:56:32.304 --> 00:56:39.388]  And of course, originally, Mesquite, Nevada posted the secret FEMA document not knowing it was secret.
[00:56:39.388 --> 00:56:42.769]  That was the local government of Mesquite, Nevada.
[00:56:42.769 --> 00:56:49.513]  So, this FEMA document's out there, and why is FEMA running around trying to get this mopped up, trying to get this covered up?
[00:56:49.513 --> 00:56:52.934]  Why are they doing this?
[00:56:52.934 --> 00:56:53.715]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:56:54.861 --> 00:56:56.243]  They train you to hate foreigners.
[00:56:56.243 --> 00:56:59.806]  They train you to go to war because somebody has brown skin.
[00:56:59.806 --> 00:57:01.008]  But don't you understand?
[00:57:01.008 --> 00:57:06.174]  Foreign, offshore, ruthless banks are in control of the United States.
[00:57:06.174 --> 00:57:08.496]  They've stolen tens of trillions of dollars.
[00:57:08.496 --> 00:57:12.561]  They're now announcing in Bloomberg and AP, the government may take your pension funds.
[00:57:13.041 --> 00:57:17.822]  And the only way they're going to get away with that is staging some type of major terrorist attack.
[00:57:17.822 --> 00:57:19.563]  It could be blowing up a federal building.
[00:57:19.563 --> 00:57:22.084]  It could be busting a nuke, setting off a nuke.
[00:57:22.084 --> 00:57:32.327]  It could be anything as a pretext to pose as our saviors and get the American people to shut up so the system can say any dissent is unpatriotic and linked to terrorism.
[00:57:32.327 --> 00:57:41.770]  And I don't have to remind you, there have been hundreds of mainstream news articles and George Soros publications lying about me saying I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite.
[00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:42.910]  So they're trying to set every
[00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:44.510]  Everybody up right now.
[00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:46.971]  America is being overthrown and taken over.
[00:57:46.971 --> 00:57:48.051]  People better wake up.
[00:57:48.051 --> 00:57:50.732]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:50.732 --> 00:57:56.013]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[00:57:56.013 --> 00:57:58.754]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[00:57:58.754 --> 00:58:04.096]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[00:58:04.096 --> 00:58:05.656]  Friends, I hope that you will order.
[00:58:05.936 --> 00:58:08.578]  Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[00:58:57.841 --> 00:58:58.723]  Okay.

[00:59:55.162 --> 00:59:58.364]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:06.640]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.421]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.421 --> 01:00:10.182]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.182 --> 01:00:11.763]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.763 --> 01:00:13.325]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.325 --> 01:00:17.487]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.487 --> 01:00:21.810]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:27.714]  All we have is our constitutional republic that protects us from tyranny.
[01:00:27.714 --> 01:00:32.138]  Once that hedge is removed, your society descends into total oppression.
[01:00:33.632 --> 01:00:47.714]  Your phone calls are coming up on this Sunday edition, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, or locally in Central Texas, 512-646-1776.
[01:00:47.714 --> 01:00:52.055]  And I did find the subsections here where they talk about the staged nuke attack.
[01:00:52.055 --> 01:00:53.695]  So I'm going to be going over that.
[01:00:53.695 --> 01:00:55.696]  Why does FEMA want this removed?
[01:00:55.696 --> 01:00:58.456]  They posted NLE-09 publicly.
[01:00:58.456 --> 01:01:01.517]  Why are they desperate to cover up NLE-010?
[01:01:04.377 --> 01:01:09.278]  Then I'm going to get into what's happening on the banking front.
[01:01:09.278 --> 01:01:19.041]  They want to codify even more power for the banks to do whatever they want.
[01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:22.382]  And they want to pass this new bill that Dodd's got introduced.
[01:01:24.537 --> 01:01:32.899]  So we'll be going over that to give unlimited power and funding, they basically already have it, to the banks to steal even more money from the American people.
[01:01:32.899 --> 01:01:34.239]  And then I have other stories like this one.
[01:01:34.239 --> 01:01:39.680]  I remember years ago reading about this in the development of 3D television.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.361]  It's different than 3D movies.
[01:01:42.361 --> 01:01:44.081]  3D TV health warning.
[01:01:44.081 --> 01:01:50.382]  Tuning in can cause confusion, nausea, and even fits, says Electronic Giant.
[01:01:50.382 --> 01:01:52.503]  So it's literal mind control.
[01:01:54.031 --> 01:01:58.532]  Uh, that is going on with this system.
[01:01:58.532 --> 01:02:02.513]  In fact, I'm looking for my, for my banking stack.
[01:02:02.513 --> 01:02:06.514]  I had a whole, whole banking stack here.
[01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:16.256]  Um, that deals with what the, um, ah, yes, here it is.
[01:02:16.256 --> 01:02:16.816]  Obama.
[01:02:18.629 --> 01:02:21.390]  Fresh crisis without new financial rules.
[01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:33.354]  So, engaged in psychological terrorism, financial terrorism, saying give me even more power or we'll have a new financial crisis.
[01:02:33.354 --> 01:02:38.175]  And then SEC accuses Goldman of fraud in housing deal.
[01:02:38.175 --> 01:02:40.296]  That's Satan investigating himself.
[01:02:40.296 --> 01:02:41.196]  And now we know the truth.
[01:02:41.196 --> 01:02:43.297]  The financial meltdown wasn't a mistake.
[01:02:43.297 --> 01:02:44.077]  It was a con.
[01:02:46.474 --> 01:02:52.219]  Update, Obama pushes bank reform, lashes out at Republicans.
[01:02:52.219 --> 01:02:53.220]  U.S.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.685]  Senate climate bill to be unveiled, that's a new funding mechanism for the banks.
[01:02:57.685 --> 01:03:02.009]  That is all coming up after the break, after we take your phone calls at 888-201-2244.
[01:03:06.724 --> 01:03:09.385]  And I would hope that you would call in about U.S.
[01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:12.206]  military with Mexican troops just killing people on the U.S.
[01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:14.426]  border with Mexico.
[01:03:14.426 --> 01:03:27.350]  I would hope you would want to talk about how they're clearly... I mean, if you didn't see it three months ago, and I was warning you every day about it, I know a lot of you have got to see it now, how they're saying, gee, I hope there didn't have to be a big terror attack in America to shut down these Tea Parties.
[01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:31.251]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are caught red-handed dressing up like Nazis trying to demonize anybody.
[01:03:32.051 --> 01:03:35.452]  And the polls show 40% are Democrats or Independents that are members.
[01:03:35.452 --> 01:03:42.694]  They are afraid of the people in a true populist constitutional movement getting together and they are apt to do anything.
[01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:44.895]  This isn't some slow revolution happening.
[01:03:44.895 --> 01:03:54.218]  This is private banks engaged in financial terrorism and an overthrow of our country, bankrupting us by design.
[01:03:54.218 --> 01:03:56.198]  Again, 888-201-2244.
[01:03:56.198 --> 01:03:58.119]  Do we have the phone system open yet?
[01:03:59.278 --> 01:03:59.778]  You are open?
[01:03:59.778 --> 01:04:00.659]  Good.
[01:04:00.659 --> 01:04:11.164]  We will take your calls coming up in the next segment, and then I will... I mean, you knew it was going to happen, and it did.
[01:04:11.164 --> 01:04:13.446]  There's an earthquake in Haiti, an earthquake in Chile.
[01:04:13.446 --> 01:04:14.626]  They say it's global warming.
[01:04:14.626 --> 01:04:16.447]  Now they're saying the volcano's global warming.
[01:04:16.447 --> 01:04:18.328]  I mean, there is no end to this.
[01:04:18.328 --> 01:04:26.853]  We're going to tie that in with a serious threat, the supervolcano that's centered in and around areas of Colorado.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:36.483]  An old faithful in that whole area.
[01:04:36.483 --> 01:04:37.984]  This is part of living on this planet.
[01:04:37.984 --> 01:04:39.904]  This planet is in constant change.
[01:04:39.904 --> 01:04:46.247]  But don't worry, you can pay a tax to Al Gore and he'll wave a magic wand and fix all of those problems.
[01:04:46.247 --> 01:04:47.688]  It's coming up after this quick break.
[01:04:49.574 --> 01:04:54.876]  Again, more of your calls straight ahead and a ton of important news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:04:54.876 --> 01:04:56.477]  InfoWars.com.
[01:04:56.477 --> 01:05:00.098]  Invisible Empire is now premiered at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:00.098 --> 01:05:03.119]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:05:03.119 --> 01:05:08.441]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:08.441 --> 01:05:10.502]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:10.502 --> 01:05:13.383]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.485]  Food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:15.485 --> 01:05:16.666]  How much do you want?
[01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:17.787]  When do you want it?
[01:05:17.787 --> 01:05:19.689]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:05:19.689 --> 01:05:20.751]  When will you need it?
[01:05:20.751 --> 01:05:22.973]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:05:22.973 --> 01:05:24.294]  Will there be any food?
[01:05:24.294 --> 01:05:25.836]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:05:25.836 --> 01:05:31.121]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:34.225]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:05:34.665 --> 01:05:38.486]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:38.486 --> 01:05:39.706]  How much will you need?
[01:05:39.706 --> 01:05:40.626]  We don't know.
[01:05:40.626 --> 01:05:41.727]  How much do you want?
[01:05:41.727 --> 01:05:42.647]  All you can get.
[01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:43.747]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:43.747 --> 01:05:46.788]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:46.788 --> 01:05:48.568]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:48.568 --> 01:05:49.488]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:05.792]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:08.098]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:18.821 --> 01:06:25.984]  Okay, if you just joined us, there's Mexican helicopters, troops running around all over South Texas and West Texas.
[01:06:25.984 --> 01:06:27.885]  That's in the news.
[01:06:27.885 --> 01:06:32.687]  My internal sources and law enforcement and the military have confirmed that U.S.
[01:06:32.687 --> 01:06:35.148]  forces are backing Mexican forces on the U.S.
[01:06:35.148 --> 01:06:37.069]  side in a giant violation of U.S.
[01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.610]  sovereignty.
[01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:44.575]  Murdering people coming across the border they claim are drug dealers involved in criminal activity.
[01:06:44.575 --> 01:06:47.477]  Just incredible police state unfolding.
[01:06:47.477 --> 01:06:52.561]  FEMA's having internal drills for nukes going off inside the United States.
[01:06:52.561 --> 01:06:56.423]  Obama and Clinton are saying nukes going off in the U.S.
[01:06:56.423 --> 01:06:57.744]  are the greatest threat.
[01:06:57.744 --> 01:07:04.670]  And the domestic groups, what the head of the FBI said Friday, are as big a threat as, quote, Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda.
[01:07:05.799 --> 01:07:14.308]  Clinton says he hopes there doesn't have to be a big terror attack to shut down the tea parties, and that he demonized the internet as bad, and that it's causing all this anger.
[01:07:14.308 --> 01:07:15.129]  No.
[01:07:15.129 --> 01:07:19.254]  We've had $28 trillion, according to Bloomberg, the last year and a half stolen.
[01:07:19.254 --> 01:07:21.637]  We've got 20-plus percent real unemployment.
[01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:25.641]  The economy's falling apart, and now they're back with the new banker bailout.
[01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:27.223]  It's not a bailout, it's a robbery.
[01:07:28.894 --> 01:07:34.497]  And so, the establishment's saying, sit down and shut up to the American people or we're gonna say you're racist.
[01:07:34.497 --> 01:07:37.098]  Oh, that doesn't make you sit down and shut up.
[01:07:37.098 --> 01:07:39.359]  What does it have to do with race to say you don't want banks raping you?
[01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:43.890]  And now they're saying, OK, well, maybe you're a terrorist.
[01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:46.231]  Gee, I hope there doesn't have to be a terror attack.
[01:07:46.231 --> 01:07:49.632]  And thank God Limbaugh and Savage and others see this for what it is.
[01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:52.433]  Savage is on the record saying he believes they're going to stage a big terror attack.
[01:07:52.433 --> 01:07:55.754]  Limbaugh says if something does happen, it may be staged.
[01:07:55.754 --> 01:07:57.894]  I mean, how obvious if they do stage something?
[01:07:57.894 --> 01:08:00.015]  They're hyping it, they're hyping it, then it happens.
[01:08:01.049 --> 01:08:08.495]  I mean, this is a revolution by offshore criminal banks, a private, corporate, hostile takeover of the country.
[01:08:08.495 --> 01:08:23.246]  And people better grow up and get involved and get angry and speak out, because if we become aware of false flags, self-inflicted wound, inside job events, if we become aware of this tactic, it then nullifies this tool to a great extent.
[01:08:24.113 --> 01:08:26.295]  They're saying they want to use NORTHCOM.
[01:08:26.295 --> 01:08:27.016]  400,000 U.S.
[01:08:27.016 --> 01:08:28.297]  troops domestically in the U.S.
[01:08:28.297 --> 01:08:29.578]  That's Army Times.
[01:08:29.578 --> 01:08:31.600]  We cover it all in Fall of the Republic.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.042]  We cover it in the Obama Deception.
[01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:35.764]  These films have all the government's documents and news articles.
[01:08:35.764 --> 01:08:39.068]  They're training the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts to spy on their parents.
[01:08:39.068 --> 01:08:41.130]  They've got naked body scanners in the airports.
[01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:46.215]  All over the country, schools are watching kids at home in bed off their government-issued laptops.
[01:08:46.215 --> 01:08:48.076]  This isn't Kansas anymore.
[01:08:49.317 --> 01:09:01.160]  What happened in Germany, what happened in Russia, what happened in China, what happened in Cambodia, what happened in Cuba, what happened in Vietnam, what happened in Venezuela, what happened in Argentina under right-wing and left-wing governments is happening.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.701]  Criminals get in, they decide to go for it all.
[01:09:03.701 --> 01:09:09.902]  We got the government, let's stage some events and take over this society.
[01:09:09.902 --> 01:09:11.623]  Don't say it can't happen here, folks.
[01:09:11.623 --> 01:09:12.563]  It is happening here.
[01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.370]  The Pentagon works for offshore banks.
[01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:17.471]  I mean, the Pentagon's out promoting global warming.
[01:09:17.471 --> 01:09:20.052]  The Pentagon is out promoting peak oils and there's not enough oil.
[01:09:20.052 --> 01:09:23.214]  I mean, it's not our average military people.
[01:09:23.214 --> 01:09:24.995]  It's the propaganda system.
[01:09:24.995 --> 01:09:29.077]  Our country isn't run by the people of the nation.
[01:09:30.236 --> 01:09:31.937]  Look at all the lies governments told you.
[01:09:31.937 --> 01:09:33.438]  Look at all the things that have happened.
[01:09:33.438 --> 01:09:39.523]  Okay, coming up, I want to get into the new banking law they want to pass to further loot you and your family.
[01:09:39.523 --> 01:09:41.585]  You think the health care is eluding?
[01:09:41.585 --> 01:09:43.406]  You think the banker bailout is eluding?
[01:09:43.406 --> 01:09:47.909]  You think the VAT tax they're calling for and the carbon taxes are eluding?
[01:09:47.909 --> 01:09:50.311]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:09:50.311 --> 01:09:56.956]  Let's talk to Proof in Las Vegas, Nevada, site of one of the government drills to nuke.
[01:09:56.956 --> 01:09:57.757]  Go ahead, Proof.
[01:09:58.908 --> 01:10:06.450]  Hey, thanks Alex, and I want to thank you so much for bringing this article to our attention regarding Vegas.
[01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:13.412]  And I have given you so much props for showing us stuff like this before everybody else.
[01:10:13.412 --> 01:10:25.076]  What I would like to know, Alex, is now that NLE10, when it was scrapped off the website, was that scrapped for good or was that just hushed because they can't keep the word out?
[01:10:25.672 --> 01:10:27.733]  Alright, let me stop you right there.
[01:10:27.733 --> 01:10:36.875]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, I will actually show you the mainstream news articles and the document right now.
[01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:38.616]  This has not been scrubbed.
[01:10:38.616 --> 01:10:40.936]  That's what's so asinine.
[01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:43.277]  A county and a city, separately,
[01:10:44.611 --> 01:11:00.869]  Posted these because a lot of government people in local areas aren't clear about documents and four years so they post their documents and And this has been in the Christian Science Monitor This has been in the Associated Press and we have links to those articles about it.
[01:11:00.869 --> 01:11:01.689]  So this would be like
[01:11:02.662 --> 01:11:03.062]  We're good.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:27.625]  And there is an article titled National Level Exercise 2010 Exercise Overview.
[01:11:27.625 --> 01:11:28.626]  There's another one.
[01:11:28.626 --> 01:11:31.068]  Why is FEMA trying to cover up NLE10?
[01:11:31.068 --> 01:11:39.114]  And here is the, let me see how many pages, yeah, 10 page document they don't want you to see.
[01:11:39.114 --> 01:11:46.860]  How they're running local police, how they're federalizing, how they're drilling for a IND nuclear terror attack.
[01:11:48.107 --> 01:11:49.748]  And they say that here in the document.
[01:11:49.748 --> 01:11:54.731]  Let me flip to that page for folks that just joined us.
[01:11:54.731 --> 01:12:00.414]  I just marked it during the two segments ago.
[01:12:00.414 --> 01:12:02.395]  But I mean, this is all up on the website, sir.
[01:12:02.395 --> 01:12:07.978]  If you want to go read this NLE 10, here it is.
[01:12:07.978 --> 01:12:16.042]  It says, Reflective of Past Exercise Lessons Learned Partnering to Nuclear Scenarios.
[01:12:16.042 --> 01:12:16.923]  That's page two.
[01:12:18.923 --> 01:12:28.668]  And then on page 5, exercise scenario and conduct, two no-notice near simultaneous IND detonations.
[01:12:28.668 --> 01:12:32.110]  And that's defined earlier as a nuclear attack.
[01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:37.733]  And then here is the Christian Science Monitor
[01:12:41.238 --> 01:12:59.427]  Well, yeah, that's exactly what my question was, and I think you may have covered it, but I am going to- Well, hold on, hold on!
[01:12:59.427 --> 01:13:05.050]  How many months ago did I tell you Obama may- or allow a terrorist or stage an event- Oh, he's not there since before he was elected!
[01:13:06.404 --> 01:13:07.185]  Exactly.
[01:13:07.185 --> 01:13:13.951]  But my point is, here's the Washington Times, Obama administration hyping terror nuclear risk.
[01:13:13.951 --> 01:13:17.935]  See, so I was saying this all week, then we get this document.
[01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:19.797]  You understand?
[01:13:19.797 --> 01:13:20.557]  Right.
[01:13:20.557 --> 01:13:24.401]  And then we know FEMA ran, let me tell people, let me tell people.
[01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:25.522]  Well since you're asking the question,
[01:13:27.339 --> 01:13:29.641]  I forget his first name.
[01:13:29.641 --> 01:13:51.395]  The deputy head of FEMA was running a drill September 10th, September 11th around the World Trade Center with the city of a terror attack on the towers and they moved their command center out that morning and he went on, you can pull this up, FEMA deputy director tells ABC News they were running drill on 9-11 and he says we were running a drill
[01:13:52.216 --> 01:13:54.498]  Oh absolutely I understand that and I'm looking forward on Saturday
[01:14:13.837 --> 01:14:21.422]  Next week I'm going to make some flyers and I'm going to let people know exactly what came out of the Washington Post and the Christian Science Monitor and everything else.
[01:14:21.422 --> 01:14:24.363]  I'm going to let as many people know as I can.
[01:14:24.363 --> 01:14:25.104]  Well, God bless you.
[01:14:25.104 --> 01:14:28.125]  What do you think is going on here?
[01:14:28.125 --> 01:14:29.126]  Sorry, I couldn't hear you, sir.
[01:14:29.126 --> 01:14:31.808]  What do you think is going on here?
[01:14:31.808 --> 01:14:32.408]  In Vegas?
[01:14:32.408 --> 01:14:33.709]  Well, what I think is that
[01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:51.833]  Uh, if they're still having it on and they're scrapping it off the website, they don't want any evidence or any paper trail saying that something is going to happen because when it happens, they don't want anyone to find a secret leaked document that says, oh look, they already planned it.
[01:14:53.658 --> 01:14:55.159]  I appreciate your call.
[01:14:55.159 --> 01:15:02.221]  I said over two years ago that Vegas was a prime target because it's going bankrupt and is having about a third the traffic it was having before.
[01:15:02.221 --> 01:15:04.982]  The mafia basically, the globalist mafia, runs Vegas.
[01:15:04.982 --> 01:15:11.745]  What a great way to blow up Vegas and then get all that insurance money and government insurance money from the American people.
[01:15:11.745 --> 01:15:15.987]  I mean, I have always said, well the CFR likes to brag about what they're planning.
[01:15:16.647 --> 01:15:24.512]  And it was the Hart-Rubin Commission six years ago that bragged Denver, Dallas, Cleveland, and two other cities were the main target.
[01:15:24.512 --> 01:15:29.976]  But I've always said, and many of my listeners have said, that Vegas is one of the prime targets.
[01:15:29.976 --> 01:15:36.400]  And now, because it's in such financial trouble, the globalists won't nuke it just for the money, but they'll pick a target
[01:15:37.461 --> 01:15:47.592]  That also has a win-win-win, kind of like the towers were leaning, they had asbestos, they were only half full, they took out a triple insurance policy on it the month before they blew them up.
[01:15:47.592 --> 01:15:54.319]  And again, folks, if you want to keep your pension funds, if you don't want to be a slave, if you want to keep your guns, wake up and realize government staged terror.
[01:15:54.319 --> 01:15:57.642]  We have criminals running our government, and 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:15:57.642 --> 01:15:59.825]  If you can't see this, you're not going to see the new one.
[01:16:00.677 --> 01:16:01.979]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:16:01.979 --> 01:16:07.565]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:16:07.565 --> 01:16:12.592]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:16:12.592 --> 01:16:17.638]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:16:18.158 --> 01:16:23.384]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:16:23.384 --> 01:16:30.512]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:16:30.512 --> 01:16:31.633]  And here's the best part.
[01:16:31.633 --> 01:16:37.980]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:41.483]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:16:41.483 --> 01:16:43.705]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:16:43.705 --> 01:16:46.968]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:16:46.968 --> 01:16:49.731]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:16:49.731 --> 01:16:57.358]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:16:57.358 --> 01:16:59.740]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:17:02.216 --> 01:17:06.157]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:17:06.157 --> 01:17:15.018]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:17:15.018 --> 01:17:19.659]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:17:19.659 --> 01:17:30.461]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:17:31.101 --> 01:17:40.623]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:17:40.623 --> 01:17:46.045]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[01:18:02.217 --> 01:18:04.359]  You're subject to other police action.
[01:18:04.359 --> 01:18:05.620]  Tyranny is here.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:09.302]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:18:09.302 --> 01:18:11.784]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:18:11.784 --> 01:18:17.648]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:18:17.648 --> 01:18:23.873]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:18:24.313 --> 01:18:30.315]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:18:30.315 --> 01:18:34.476]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:38.757]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:44.719]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:48.260]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:50.241]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:18:50.241 --> 01:18:50.661]  It's here.

[01:19:07.234 --> 01:19:12.358]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:19:12.358 --> 01:19:19.084]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:27.437]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:19:29.414 --> 01:19:34.177]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:19:34.177 --> 01:19:37.999]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[01:19:37.999 --> 01:19:39.240]  Others don't.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.381]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:19:41.381 --> 01:19:43.162]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:19:43.162 --> 01:19:46.064]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:19:46.064 --> 01:19:52.688]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.751]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:58.251]  Others don't.
[01:20:01.624 --> 01:20:05.206]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.206 --> 01:20:08.788]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:08.788 --> 01:20:22.895]  Now I'll make another prediction.
[01:20:22.895 --> 01:20:29.098]  I predict that very soon, Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[01:20:30.612 --> 01:20:49.048]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are, Rahm Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind, and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[01:20:49.048 --> 01:20:52.691]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[01:20:52.691 --> 01:20:58.075]  I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized control of the most powerful economy...
[01:20:59.210 --> 01:21:04.132]  And again, we have similar Rush Limbaugh transcripts saying they may stage something.
[01:21:04.132 --> 01:21:09.694]  And now, Clinton is out saying, gee, I hope there isn't another Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:21:09.694 --> 01:21:14.695]  And separately, top nuclear experts are saying it's nothing but fear-mongering and hype.
[01:21:14.695 --> 01:21:18.517]  Obama's saying the number one threat to America is a nuke attack.
[01:21:18.517 --> 01:21:24.859]  They'll blame the nuke attack on a foreign government, and they'll blame terror attacks on federal buildings on the American people.
[01:21:25.925 --> 01:21:40.474]  I've been predicting this and predicting this and predicting this and one hour after Joe Stack supposedly flew his plane to that building and all the evidence says that was staged, all the witnesses said nobody in the plane, emergency crews already there, told to show up early, on and on and on.
[01:21:40.474 --> 01:21:43.997]  He was tied into black ops, his family came out and said it was a cover-up.
[01:21:45.438 --> 01:21:50.080]  He was tied into Homeland Security and remote control aircraft, all of this.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:57.464]  One hour after it happened, I went live on my weekday show at 11am, about an hour and eight minutes after it happened, and I said they're going to blame me within hours.
[01:21:57.464 --> 01:22:00.305]  Within one hour of airtime, two hours of it happening,
[01:22:00.945 --> 01:22:07.467]  Austin American Statesman, New York Daily News, London Guardian saying I had called for this attack.
[01:22:07.467 --> 01:22:09.748]  Now folks, I'm here being framed.
[01:22:09.748 --> 01:22:12.048]  I speak out against violence every day.
[01:22:12.048 --> 01:22:21.271]  I told you three and a half weeks ago as we were reading it on the big government-funded anarchist websites that they were going to come out with Nazi signs and stage violence at tea parties.
[01:22:21.271 --> 01:22:23.491]  Now it's in the Associated Press!
[01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:27.333]  What does it take for you to get that I know what I'm talking about here?
[01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:27.673]  Okay?
[01:22:27.673 --> 01:22:28.653]  I just tell the truth.
[01:22:30.703 --> 01:22:33.304]  Now, it's psychological terror to say we're going to be nuked.
[01:22:33.304 --> 01:22:37.926]  It's psychological terror to say the Tea Parties are going to blow up a federal building and that the Internet's bad.
[01:22:37.926 --> 01:22:39.247]  That may be all they do.
[01:22:39.247 --> 01:22:41.348]  And if we get the word out, it may stop there.
[01:22:41.348 --> 01:22:42.808]  But let me tell you something.
[01:22:42.808 --> 01:22:43.709]  Get it through your head.
[01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.170]  America is run by offshore banks.
[01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:48.011]  They've stolen tens of trillions.
[01:22:48.011 --> 01:22:50.492]  They've got new legislation to take even more.
[01:22:50.492 --> 01:22:51.953]  They're not playing games.
[01:22:51.953 --> 01:22:55.494]  They're in Bloomberg and AP saying they're going to take your pension funds next.
[01:22:55.494 --> 01:22:56.555]  In fact, print me that again.
[01:22:57.415 --> 01:23:01.997]  Government regulators tell pension funds to invest in failed banks, ordering them to.
[01:23:01.997 --> 01:23:04.818]  This is about power and global domination.
[01:23:04.818 --> 01:23:10.360]  You don't just think the people running our country have invaded over 100 nations and have 170 military bases.
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:13.661]  You don't just think they'll kill a million Iraqis and don't care about anybody else.
[01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:15.201]  They'll do that here.
[01:23:15.201 --> 01:23:17.682]  The average military and the average cops aren't involved.
[01:23:17.682 --> 01:23:19.623]  They'll be PSYOP like everybody else.
[01:23:24.226 --> 01:23:25.587]  This isn't a radio show.
[01:23:25.587 --> 01:23:26.768]  It's not entertainment.
[01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:30.131]  It's not a game.
[01:23:30.131 --> 01:23:39.338]  And every cop, every military person, every FBI agent, every bureaucrat out there, you're in the same boat as the American people, and you better get that through your head right now.
[01:23:39.338 --> 01:23:42.340]  You better understand these people mean business.
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:48.445]  The same banks on record, now declassified, funded the communists and the fascists.
[01:23:48.445 --> 01:23:53.189]  As Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor at Georgetown, the head of political science, wrote, it's all staged.
[01:23:54.389 --> 01:23:55.911]  And now they're taking down America.
[01:23:55.911 --> 01:23:56.332]  Here it is.
[01:23:56.332 --> 01:23:59.657]  Failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash.
[01:23:59.657 --> 01:24:00.958]  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
[01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:06.366]  is trying to encourage public retirement funds that control more than $2 trillion to buy all or part of failed lenders.
[01:24:06.366 --> 01:24:07.368]  And take your money!
[01:24:09.068 --> 01:24:10.588]  That's criminal!
[01:24:10.588 --> 01:24:13.809]  The health care bill is unconstitutional and criminal.
[01:24:13.809 --> 01:24:16.310]  I've got mainstream news.
[01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:18.270]  Should Obama control the web?
[01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:19.831]  Obama can shut off the web.
[01:24:19.831 --> 01:24:21.911]  In fact, Google that and give me an article.
[01:24:21.911 --> 01:24:27.893]  I mean, they're saying, half the czars in the White House are saying shut down free speech.
[01:24:27.893 --> 01:24:36.055]  I had a radio exec in my office Friday, a guy that works with all the big executives, Glenn Beck's people, Limbaugh's people, everybody.
[01:24:36.055 --> 01:24:36.835]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:24:36.835 --> 01:24:37.295]  He knows them all.
[01:24:37.995 --> 01:24:41.499]  And he said, yes, they're all have basically FBI agents protecting them.
[01:24:41.499 --> 01:24:42.840]  They're retired.
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.062]  They're scared to death.
[01:24:44.062 --> 01:24:47.245]  And and this guy was asking me, where should I move?
[01:24:47.245 --> 01:24:48.547]  I may leave the country.
[01:24:48.547 --> 01:24:54.253]  OK, I don't have radio execs and radio people high level making fun of me anymore.
[01:24:55.214 --> 01:25:06.921]  You know, I had them calling me 10 years ago, 8 years ago, 5 years ago, 4 years ago, saying, you're a dynamic talk show host, let us hire you, but no New World Order, no Federal Reserve, no the banks are gonna get us stuff.
[01:25:06.921 --> 01:25:09.942]  Be a mainline Republican and you're gonna be king.
[01:25:09.942 --> 01:25:14.084]  I was offered what Glenn Beck has, over and over and over again.
[01:25:14.084 --> 01:25:16.046]  But the truth is what matters to me.
[01:25:16.046 --> 01:25:21.949]  I will go all the way, every time, and to all you radio executives out there,
[01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:29.090]  And all you in the media that are listening, look, you're not going to have a country if you don't stand up.
[01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:31.431]  And the good news is people are finally starting to tell the truth.
[01:25:31.431 --> 01:25:50.285]  I mean, look, I've criticized Rush Limbaugh, and I don't think he's gone far enough, and he defends the Republican Party and everything else, but what I've been hearing lately is they may stage something, this is terrorism, they're setting us up, they're provocateuring, you know, they're un-American, they're destroying the economy by design, this is criminal, we've got to do something.
[01:25:54.201 --> 01:25:55.182]  I give credit where it's due.
[01:25:55.182 --> 01:25:57.343]  Limbaugh and Savage.
[01:25:57.343 --> 01:26:00.366]  They're the only ones going all the way, or even close to it.
[01:26:00.366 --> 01:26:05.069]  Now look, how long have I told you that Goldman Sachs is a criminal operation?
[01:26:05.069 --> 01:26:07.471]  They run every major regulatory agency.
[01:26:07.471 --> 01:26:08.932]  Their former people do.
[01:26:08.932 --> 01:26:10.393]  They've got the Treasury Secretary.
[01:26:10.393 --> 01:26:11.794]  They've got the New York Fed Chief.
[01:26:11.794 --> 01:26:14.016]  They've got the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
[01:26:14.016 --> 01:26:15.317]  All are their people.
[01:26:15.317 --> 01:26:16.818]  They engineered the crisis.
[01:26:16.818 --> 01:26:19.300]  Four months ago we had the big McClatchy news writer.
[01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:19.881]  What's his name on?
[01:26:21.263 --> 01:26:28.588]  Greg Gordon on, who got, via lawsuits, the internal documents where Goldman Sachs engineered this whole thing by design.
[01:26:28.588 --> 01:26:40.976]  And so now they've been indicted civilly by the Security and Exchange Commission, filled with their people, so they can suck up all the evidence and then have a $5 million fine on trillions stolen.
[01:26:40.976 --> 01:26:46.000]  That'd be like if you robbed a bank, you're walking out with a million dollars, and the cops say, give me a thousand and I'll let you go.
[01:26:48.809 --> 01:26:49.690]  And here it is.
[01:26:49.690 --> 01:26:52.332]  I mean, this is not my opinion.
[01:26:52.332 --> 01:26:55.655]  This is the London Guardian, the biggest newspaper in Europe.
[01:26:55.655 --> 01:26:56.776]  Now we know the truth.
[01:26:56.776 --> 01:26:59.158]  The financial meltdown wasn't a mistake.
[01:26:59.158 --> 01:27:01.400]  It was a con.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:02.381]  It's a con.
[01:27:02.381 --> 01:27:03.162]  It's a con.
[01:27:03.162 --> 01:27:04.723]  It's not your government.
[01:27:04.723 --> 01:27:06.345]  It's not your Pentagon.
[01:27:06.345 --> 01:27:07.566]  It's not your country.
[01:27:08.652 --> 01:27:10.273]  And these people are going for broke.
[01:27:10.273 --> 01:27:12.914]  This is going to be like a red terror in this country.
[01:27:12.914 --> 01:27:17.116]  They're not training checkpoints at FEMA camps and kids to spy on their parents for nothing.
[01:27:17.116 --> 01:27:22.199]  This isn't going to be some boss hog, bid rigging, scam or insider trading.
[01:27:22.199 --> 01:27:24.560]  This is the total takeover of our country.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.722]  They've already committed so many crimes, they're going for broke now.
[01:27:28.783 --> 01:27:31.625]  They're going all the way now.
[01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:32.705]  And I'm all the way.
[01:27:32.705 --> 01:27:34.266]  I'm all in to fight them.
[01:27:34.266 --> 01:27:39.489]  My name, my treasure, my blood, my honor, who I am is on the line.
[01:27:39.489 --> 01:27:41.550]  Just like John Adams or George Washington.
[01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:44.892]  And all of you have a chance to be part of history on the side of right.
[01:27:45.632 --> 01:28:01.385]  So many well-meaning, smart, intelligent, dynamic, yuppies out there, making hundreds of thousands or millions a year, and you laugh at anybody who's involved, like they're un-American, and you're smart because you're not involved, and you ride the fence, you take the middle way.
[01:28:01.385 --> 01:28:07.190]  Mark my words, if we lose this country, it is your fault, you jackasses out there.
[01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:12.074]  We know the globalists are evil, we know their game plan, thousands of their documents have fallen into our hands.
[01:28:13.581 --> 01:28:16.283]  And we know the general public's dumbed down.
[01:28:16.283 --> 01:28:22.968]  But those of you who are intelligent and know which way the wind blows better get off your big fat butts and do something.
[01:28:22.968 --> 01:28:24.429]  That's all I can say to you right now.
[01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:27.672]  I mean, it came out in Congress two weeks ago.
[01:28:27.672 --> 01:28:29.253]  100 to 1 leverage.
[01:28:29.253 --> 01:28:30.794]  World's largest fraud exposed.
[01:28:30.794 --> 01:28:33.937]  JPMorgan Chase caught manipulating gold and silver market.
[01:28:35.549 --> 01:28:38.271]  Obama pushing new banking takeover.
[01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:42.274]  Goldman Sachs indicted civilly, New York Times.
[01:28:42.274 --> 01:28:43.795]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[01:28:43.795 --> 01:28:45.417]  I'm gonna come back and go to call after call.
[01:28:45.417 --> 01:28:53.103]  Mike, Pete, Victoria, Smukim, Mark, Herman, Annie, uh, Marlene, Leo, others.
[01:28:53.103 --> 01:28:56.926]  Your call, straight ahead after the news, on the other side.
[01:28:56.926 --> 01:28:59.768]  This is the defense of our republic, toe-to-toe!

[01:30:01.155 --> 01:30:04.176]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.176 --> 01:30:09.497]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.497 --> 01:30:11.538]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.538 --> 01:30:16.539]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.539 --> 01:30:17.740]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:18.460]  When do you want it?
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:20.742]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:20.742 --> 01:30:21.803]  When will you need it?
[01:30:21.803 --> 01:30:24.005]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.005 --> 01:30:25.346]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.346 --> 01:30:26.887]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:26.887 --> 01:30:32.152]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.152 --> 01:30:35.275]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:35.715 --> 01:30:39.538]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.538 --> 01:30:40.779]  How much will you need?
[01:30:40.779 --> 01:30:41.679]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.679 --> 01:30:42.780]  How much do you want?
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.521]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:44.821]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.821 --> 01:30:47.864]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:47.864 --> 01:30:50.045]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:50.045 --> 01:30:51.066]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.339 --> 01:31:01.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:07.226]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:31:07.226 --> 01:31:12.251]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:12.251 --> 01:31:17.277]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:31:17.797 --> 01:31:23.041]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:23.041 --> 01:31:30.147]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:30.147 --> 01:31:31.268]  And here's the best part.
[01:31:31.268 --> 01:31:37.633]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:37.953 --> 01:31:41.136]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:41.136 --> 01:31:43.358]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:31:43.358 --> 01:31:44.299]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.299 --> 01:31:44.639]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:44.639 --> 01:31:47.942]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:47.942 --> 01:31:49.684]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:00.131 --> 01:32:02.452]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:32:02.452 --> 01:32:04.834]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:32:04.834 --> 01:32:08.036]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:32:08.036 --> 01:32:13.139]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:32:13.139 --> 01:32:17.661]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:32:17.661 --> 01:32:20.103]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:32:20.103 --> 01:32:22.544]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:32:22.544 --> 01:32:25.406]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:32:25.786 --> 01:32:33.734]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:32:33.734 --> 01:32:39.099]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:32:39.099 --> 01:32:41.442]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:32:41.442 --> 01:32:45.386]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:32:45.686 --> 01:32:46.747]  And I got news for you.
[01:32:46.747 --> 01:32:48.068]  You're everyone else.
[01:32:48.068 --> 01:32:49.489]  Invisible Empire.

[01:33:01.597 --> 01:33:03.138]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:03.138 --> 01:33:05.179]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:08.401]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:15.592 --> 01:33:29.450]  Well, interchangeable mind control Could weld a revolution and take its toll If you could, I think I'd switch and open your third eye And say that we should never be afraid to die
[01:33:31.332 --> 01:33:50.162]  Communism, socialism, fascism, all forms of centralization come from the financial elite to consolidate power.
[01:33:50.162 --> 01:33:56.066]  America is the shining city on a hill, a plum, and if they can capture it fully, they can dominate the globe.
[01:33:57.236 --> 01:34:01.384]  This will destroy our freedom and our liberty, not just for our children.
[01:34:01.384 --> 01:34:03.929]  We won't have to wait, but for us.
[01:34:03.929 --> 01:34:05.472]  Here's the Times of London.
[01:34:05.472 --> 01:34:09.019]  Domestic terrorist as big a threat as al-Qaeda says FBI head Robert Mueller.
[01:34:10.814 --> 01:34:13.276]  Here's AP, similar headline.
[01:34:13.276 --> 01:34:16.158]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:34:16.158 --> 01:34:18.379]  Any dissent is going to be called terrorism.
[01:34:18.379 --> 01:34:21.541]  Are you going to roll over and go along with this?
[01:34:21.541 --> 01:34:25.984]  It's a life and death situation to expose false flag government sponsored terror.
[01:34:25.984 --> 01:34:29.247]  If you don't expose it, they'll continue to carry it out.
[01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:37.653]  We've already caught them dressing up like Nazis nationwide to demonize anybody that doesn't want the government to jack taxes up and take over our lives.
[01:34:38.527 --> 01:34:39.648]  Alright, I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:34:39.648 --> 01:34:42.911]  I've got some other news I want to get to, but right now let's go to your calls.
[01:34:42.911 --> 01:34:44.792]  Please have your question and comment ready.
[01:34:44.792 --> 01:34:46.934]  Mike in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:34:46.934 --> 01:34:48.895]  How are you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:34:48.895 --> 01:34:50.217]  God bless your whole team.
[01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:51.297]  You guys are phenomenal.
[01:34:51.297 --> 01:34:52.739]  You're asking how I'm doing?
[01:34:52.739 --> 01:34:55.801]  I'm not doing good, because I've been proven right again.
[01:34:55.801 --> 01:34:57.763]  Everything's happening just as we foresaw it.
[01:34:59.139 --> 01:35:06.943]  I do confirm your broadcast, but I've been living what you've been talking about for the last five years directly at the hands of local municipality.
[01:35:06.943 --> 01:35:16.488]  Stole a limousine, disseminated a working business that was probably making more money than they were on my own efforts, and they've been pounding on me pretty much ever since I sent you a
[01:35:22.492 --> 01:35:28.036]  Sir, I am just flooded with people having their kids taken, their businesses taken, people being abused.
[01:35:28.036 --> 01:35:32.980]  It's in the news that judges are taking money under the table to put innocent people in private jails.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:34.822]  I mean, it's just wall-to-wall corruption.
[01:35:34.822 --> 01:35:36.423]  What's on your mind, Mike?
[01:35:36.423 --> 01:35:38.064]  Well, a couple things, actually.
[01:35:38.064 --> 01:35:41.186]  I have an alternate fuel system I've designed that works pretty good.
[01:35:41.186 --> 01:35:42.287]  I'm working on refining.
[01:35:43.769 --> 01:35:46.853]  Again, they're disseminating every effort I have for work.
[01:35:46.853 --> 01:35:50.677]  It's kind of been holding me up, but that isn't what I'm calling a cry about at all.
[01:35:50.677 --> 01:35:54.362]  I wouldn't mind getting that point across to you, though.
[01:35:54.362 --> 01:36:01.490]  Also, I've been flooded with love in here, so I apologize for stammering.
[01:36:04.463 --> 01:36:09.646]  I see reports every week of cops raping women and it's not saying the average cop is bad, but they're protecting the bad cops.
[01:36:09.646 --> 01:36:10.367]  Mike, I gotta jump.
[01:36:10.367 --> 01:36:13.388]  Pete in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:36:13.388 --> 01:36:14.909]  We're gonna move quick here.
[01:36:14.909 --> 01:36:15.430]  Pete, go ahead.
[01:36:27.153 --> 01:36:35.675]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to know, I know there's a march coming up in Washington next month, at the end of the month, and I was wondering if you were going to be there?
[01:36:35.675 --> 01:36:36.695]  No, I'm not.
[01:36:36.695 --> 01:36:41.596]  But, I mean, Oath Keepers had to cancel their Tea Party march because violence was threatened against them.
[01:36:41.596 --> 01:36:42.716]  That's what the government's doing.
[01:36:42.716 --> 01:36:47.457]  It's threatening violence, sending hippies dressed as Nazis to discredit us.
[01:36:47.457 --> 01:36:51.058]  This is another form of false flag frame-up terror.
[01:36:51.058 --> 01:36:52.058]  It's out in the open!
[01:36:53.351 --> 01:36:53.831]  Okay.
[01:36:53.831 --> 01:37:04.059]  Well, also, if I might add, I was wondering, since we're talking about this nuclear attack that they're planning, I looked at the NLE10, and it says that it's going to be at the end of next month.
[01:37:04.059 --> 01:37:04.219]  Yes.
[01:37:04.219 --> 01:37:08.843]  What are the odds that they attack on that day of the march in Washington?
[01:37:08.843 --> 01:37:12.906]  Because we all know Washington is the most broke and unproductive of the whole United States.
[01:37:13.226 --> 01:37:14.528]  Very well said, Pete.
[01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:16.450]  Here's the reason we're so freaked out about this.
[01:37:16.450 --> 01:37:21.075]  FEMA wants this document suppressed and is telling newspapers not to report on it.
[01:37:21.075 --> 01:37:26.141]  We have the newspapers saying they've received letters from FEMA up on Infowars.com.
[01:37:26.141 --> 01:37:27.382]  Mainstream News reporting this.
[01:37:28.263 --> 01:37:39.208]  Over and over again, on 7-7 in London with the train bombings, the government ran a drill, the exact same targets attacked at the exact same time, that's BBC News, ITN-TV, London Guardian.
[01:37:39.208 --> 01:37:41.568]  9-11, drills were ran.
[01:37:41.568 --> 01:37:45.870]  Oklahoma City, BATF ran a drill, the building began an attack that morning.
[01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:49.652]  It's been come out in federal documents, the FBI was there running the whole operation.
[01:37:49.652 --> 01:37:51.032]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:37:51.032 --> 01:37:52.173]  Drill after drill.
[01:37:52.893 --> 01:38:00.200]  Because most of the government, 99% of the government, is not involved in terror attacks, not involved in criminality, not involved.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:06.186]  But they're surveilling, and they've got good agents out there, and detectives, and local police detectives.
[01:38:06.186 --> 01:38:09.789]  And so, if they actually find a real terror attack,
[01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:12.330]  They then say, oh, it was part of a drill.
[01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:13.431]  Go back to 1999.
[01:38:13.431 --> 01:38:16.571]  Vladimir Putin, vice president, very unpopular.
[01:38:16.571 --> 01:38:17.572]  He's not going to be elected.
[01:38:17.572 --> 01:38:25.253]  He's the vice president of the drunken thug that they had in at the time, Boris Yeltsin.
[01:38:25.253 --> 01:38:28.294]  Three apartment buildings are blown up in Moscow.
[01:38:28.294 --> 01:38:38.156]  In a fourth building, local Moscow police in a suburb find FSB, Federal Security Bureau, planting bombs on the columns.
[01:38:39.396 --> 01:38:43.259]  And then Putin comes in and says it was just a drill.
[01:38:43.259 --> 01:38:47.682]  So see, I mean, they do drill after drill after drill, and they had drills on 9-11.
[01:38:47.682 --> 01:38:49.944]  Go ahead.
[01:38:49.944 --> 01:38:50.404]  He dropped.
[01:38:50.404 --> 01:38:52.286]  Let's go to Victoria in Virginia.
[01:38:52.286 --> 01:38:53.567]  Victoria, you're on the air.
[01:38:53.567 --> 01:38:53.887]  Welcome.
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:55.721]  Thank you.
[01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:59.784]  Thank you for everything that you're doing and just to let you know we're praying for you every day.
[01:38:59.784 --> 01:39:02.566]  I need it.
[01:39:02.566 --> 01:39:03.948]  Two really quick things.
[01:39:03.948 --> 01:39:06.810]  No, I'll probably have black sedans following me home tonight.
[01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:07.410]  I mean, I mean it.
[01:39:07.410 --> 01:39:09.612]  Thank you.
[01:39:09.612 --> 01:39:12.715]  No, really Alex, you do have a lot of people praying for you because
[01:39:13.183 --> 01:39:13.664]  I appreciate you.
[01:39:36.599 --> 01:39:37.259]  That's right.
[01:39:37.259 --> 01:39:39.101]  Minot, South Dakota, two nukes were taken.
[01:39:39.101 --> 01:39:40.121]  Absolutely.
[01:39:40.121 --> 01:39:40.782]  It's incredible.
[01:40:01.221 --> 01:40:05.025]  Because of the bad veterans and Christians and all of this.
[01:40:05.025 --> 01:40:11.731]  And I was just shocked saying that we are threatening them because we want them to uphold the Constitution.
[01:40:11.731 --> 01:40:13.193]  And I thought, what nerve!
[01:40:14.636 --> 01:40:18.658]  Well, I mean, ma'am, again, I'll go back to last January.
[01:40:18.658 --> 01:40:21.099]  State police send me one document.
[01:40:21.099 --> 01:40:24.200]  A federal marshal sends me the other federal master document.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:27.902]  I mean, that's in the Kansas City Star Associated Press that we broke it.
[01:40:27.902 --> 01:40:31.103]  And it said gun owners, veterans, conservatives.
[01:40:31.103 --> 01:40:34.305]  And now it's confirmed veterans are being tracked by Homeland Security.
[01:40:34.305 --> 01:40:38.887]  And now the FBI admits they're tracking veterans and they're training youth corps.
[01:40:38.887 --> 01:40:40.848]  New York Times reports, in fact, pull that up.
[01:40:42.409 --> 01:40:52.815]  I just googled Boy Scouts Homeland Security, it's the first link, New York Times, to take on veterans and, I mean, this is the equivalent of a Soviet takeover.
[01:40:52.815 --> 01:40:57.517]  This is a Red Dawn, but run by our own supposed government.
[01:40:57.517 --> 01:41:00.979]  And yes, I've seen it all over the news, without even looking for it, I see it.
[01:41:00.979 --> 01:41:08.223]  CNN, MSNBC, you said you saw it on another channel, saying that, oh look, the MIAC and Homeland Security reports were right.
[01:41:08.223 --> 01:41:10.585]  Domestic terrorists are the American people.
[01:41:10.945 --> 01:41:13.808]  Anybody who doesn't want this takeover is a terrorist!
[01:41:13.808 --> 01:41:16.791]  I mean, how long did I warn people this was being set up for us?
[01:41:16.791 --> 01:41:18.332]  There's the New York Times headline.
[01:41:18.332 --> 01:41:20.294]  Put it back up for me.
[01:41:20.294 --> 01:41:22.917]  Scouts train to fight terrorists and more.
[01:41:22.917 --> 01:41:24.899]  Let me see the first paragraph.
[01:41:24.899 --> 01:41:34.429]  It says, 10 minutes into an errant mayhem in the town near the Mexican border and a gunman, a disgruntled Iraqi veteran, has already taken two people hostage.
[01:41:35.029 --> 01:41:40.815]  And then they have photos where they send 14-year-olds in with machine guns to kill a U.S.
[01:41:40.815 --> 01:41:41.416]  vet.
[01:41:41.416 --> 01:41:44.319]  And see, I've covered the drills.
[01:41:44.319 --> 01:41:49.785]  And 90% of the time or more, they're training to take on the American people.
[01:41:49.785 --> 01:41:52.468]  None of it has to do with Al-Qaeda!
[01:41:52.468 --> 01:41:53.850]  It's all for us!
[01:41:53.850 --> 01:41:54.691]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:55.982 --> 01:42:09.211]  No, you know what you're saying is absolutely right, but it's like what nerve that they want to attack us because we want them to uphold the Constitution and follow the rules and regulations that this country is governing by.
[01:42:09.211 --> 01:42:09.411]  Exactly!
[01:42:09.411 --> 01:42:10.492]  They're the traitors!
[01:42:10.492 --> 01:42:11.572]  They're the usurpers!
[01:42:11.572 --> 01:42:14.574]  They're the offshore banks overthrowing America!
[01:42:14.574 --> 01:42:21.379]  So of course they're saying, real Americans saying, this is our country, we're the sovereign citizens, you're not going to violate the Constitution.
[01:42:21.379 --> 01:42:23.300]  Of course they're saying we're terrorists!
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:24.581]  That's what I'm saying!
[01:42:24.581 --> 01:42:25.862]  Look, how transparent is that?
[01:42:25.862 --> 01:42:26.042]  Is it?
[01:42:45.171 --> 01:42:50.114]  I'm gonna blitz through calls in the final segment, hit a few other news items, but yes, I'm desperate.
[01:42:50.114 --> 01:42:51.195]  Yes, I'm hyped up.
[01:42:51.195 --> 01:42:52.756]  Yes, I'm yelling and screaming.
[01:42:52.756 --> 01:42:56.798]  Just like you yell and scream about some football game, I yell and scream about reality.
[01:42:56.798 --> 01:43:01.581]  I love this country!
[01:43:01.581 --> 01:43:03.642]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
[01:43:04.494 --> 01:43:05.917]  Now what am I going to do?
[01:43:05.917 --> 01:43:08.080]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:08.962]  Okay.

[01:45:01.454 --> 01:45:04.476]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:45:04.476 --> 01:45:09.800]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.842]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:45:11.842 --> 01:45:16.846]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:45:16.846 --> 01:45:18.047]  How much do you want?
[01:45:18.047 --> 01:45:18.768]  When do you want it?
[01:45:19.148 --> 01:45:21.031]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:45:21.031 --> 01:45:22.092]  When will you need it?
[01:45:22.092 --> 01:45:24.315]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:45:24.315 --> 01:45:25.637]  Will there be any food?
[01:45:25.637 --> 01:45:27.179]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:45:27.179 --> 01:45:32.446]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:45:32.446 --> 01:45:35.571]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:45:36.011 --> 01:45:39.833]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:45:39.833 --> 01:45:41.053]  How much will you need?
[01:45:41.053 --> 01:45:41.974]  We don't know.
[01:45:41.974 --> 01:45:43.074]  How much do you want?
[01:45:43.074 --> 01:45:43.814]  All you can get.
[01:45:43.814 --> 01:45:45.095]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:45:45.095 --> 01:45:48.136]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:45:48.136 --> 01:45:50.997]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:45:50.997 --> 01:45:51.758]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:46:01.812 --> 01:46:10.296]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[01:46:10.296 --> 01:46:21.180]  As of January 1st, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:26.603]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:46:27.163 --> 01:46:32.067]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[01:46:32.067 --> 01:46:41.134]  Colloidal Silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:46:41.134 --> 01:46:51.262]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own Colloidal Silver right from home.
[01:46:51.262 --> 01:46:54.924]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:46:54.924 --> 01:46:55.965]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:47:01.710 --> 01:47:05.293]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.293 --> 01:47:08.876]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:08.876 --> 01:47:17.564]  Let me loose!
[01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:23.829]  You have a choice to make, America, and the rest of the world, freedom or slavery.
[01:47:23.829 --> 01:47:25.391]  Both major parties are controlled.
[01:47:27.333 --> 01:47:29.636]  Every president we get, things only get worse.
[01:47:29.636 --> 01:47:33.040]  But clearly the globalists are making their move right now.
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.501]  We have to stop trusting government.
[01:47:34.501 --> 01:47:35.522]  We have to get informed.
[01:47:35.522 --> 01:47:37.124]  We have to get involved.
[01:47:37.124 --> 01:47:38.606]  We have to stand up against the system.
[01:47:38.606 --> 01:47:39.827]  We have to cut government.
[01:47:39.827 --> 01:47:42.790]  It is taxes that fund this cancer.
[01:47:44.028 --> 01:47:46.510]  Our military spends almost two trillion dollars a year.
[01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:50.132]  The foreign banks get tens of trillions a year.
[01:47:50.132 --> 01:47:52.074]  Many times what our taxes are.
[01:47:52.074 --> 01:47:53.975]  They're running us deep into debt.
[01:47:53.975 --> 01:48:00.039]  They're bankrupting us, by design, like a third world nation.
[01:48:00.039 --> 01:48:05.283]  And they're saying that anybody that criticizes anything the government does is a racist or a terrorist.
[01:48:05.283 --> 01:48:07.685]  How much more transparent does that have to be?
[01:48:07.685 --> 01:48:11.688]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:48:11.688 --> 01:48:12.888]  Good day, Alex.
[01:48:12.888 --> 01:48:13.349]  Hello, Mark.
[01:48:14.184 --> 01:48:14.824]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:14.824 --> 01:48:16.085]  Great to speak with you again.
[01:48:16.085 --> 01:48:17.486]  Always great.
[01:48:17.486 --> 01:48:25.389]  I wanted to, um, just make a... Actually, I'm going to leave my comment off for time's sake, and I want to ask you two questions.
[01:48:25.389 --> 01:48:36.315]  Earlier in the show, you mentioned that there are two opposing factions in the Illuminati relative to the implementation of the overall agenda, and that this conflict is manifested in the U.S.
[01:48:36.315 --> 01:48:38.295]  military.
[01:48:38.295 --> 01:48:43.298]  Would you please flesh this out as much as possible as to what this disagreement is about, number one,
[01:48:43.971 --> 01:48:46.252]  And who the big players are, number two.
[01:48:46.252 --> 01:48:56.814]  If you have time, would you please describe your estimation of what reality will be like in America if they pull off their nuclear false flag?
[01:48:56.814 --> 01:48:57.374]  Alright, Mark.
[01:48:57.374 --> 01:48:58.255]  Very good question.
[01:48:58.255 --> 01:49:00.155]  Okay.
[01:49:00.155 --> 01:49:01.895]  There isn't one monolithic group.
[01:49:01.895 --> 01:49:04.616]  At the top, there's the central banks that dominate the planet.
[01:49:04.616 --> 01:49:07.717]  They're the biggest organization that control the issuance of currency and credit.
[01:49:09.338 --> 01:49:18.320]  Beneath them, there is a lot of old money that isn't part of the inter-elite, but is tied into it different business dealings.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:27.222]  And there's a lot of upper middle class people and organizations and groups that are now realizing that globalization isn't good.
[01:49:27.222 --> 01:49:29.243]  Globalization means to screw them.
[01:49:30.649 --> 01:49:31.349]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:31.349 --> 01:49:31.709]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:58.536 --> 01:50:08.404]  And in the military, you've got a lot of great men and women who are patriots, who are finally being forced to see how they're being used to bring down the Republic.
[01:50:08.404 --> 01:50:19.053]  And so, you've got the population waking up, and you've got the elite with this long-term plan being carried out, and so that's the battle that's going on.
[01:50:19.053 --> 01:50:20.634]  Let's talk to Herman in New York.
[01:50:20.634 --> 01:50:24.097]  Herman, you're on the air.
[01:50:24.097 --> 01:50:25.859]  Yes, hello Alex, can you hear me?
[01:50:25.859 --> 01:50:26.159]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:28.230 --> 01:50:31.352]  Yes, I just want to say that everything you've been saying is correct.
[01:50:31.352 --> 01:50:34.495]  Hundreds of thousands of foreign troops have been deployed.
[01:50:34.495 --> 01:50:37.337]  Like you said, FEMA can't body scan and Boy Scouts training.
[01:50:37.337 --> 01:50:39.158]  I mean, the media is scaring us.
[01:50:39.158 --> 01:50:41.420]  This has pretty much been planned for years.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:42.080]  Exactly!
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.781]  They've got their forces in place.
[01:50:43.781 --> 01:50:47.844]  They admit they'll use foreign troops in America and NLE-09.
[01:50:47.844 --> 01:50:49.145]  It's all on record.
[01:50:49.145 --> 01:50:51.867]  They're merging our troops with the Mexican military.
[01:50:51.867 --> 01:50:52.968]  All this is going on.
[01:50:52.968 --> 01:50:54.569]  I mean, this has all been premeditated.
[01:50:56.132 --> 01:51:13.722]  Absolutely, and I just wanted to say, the first thing I want to say, uh, two things is that this is actually going to be the perfect time to spread your DVD to Police Day 4 and Invisible Empire, but my question is this, um, do you think this time, as skeptical as the people are, that this false flag will work?
[01:51:13.722 --> 01:51:14.042]  Thank you.
[01:51:14.963 --> 01:51:15.644]  God bless you.
[01:51:15.644 --> 01:51:17.225]  I don't think it's going to work.
[01:51:17.225 --> 01:51:30.654]  Reading Cass Sunstein at the White House, the regulations are, reading Rand Corporation, reading Pentagon documents, listening to what the elites are saying because they think the public's dumb and doesn't read their own documents, they come within one inch of admitting they're staging the terror.
[01:51:30.654 --> 01:51:37.660]  I remember four years ago, it's in Truth Rising, Luke Radowsky and others ask one of the head CFR guys,
[01:51:39.141 --> 01:51:42.703]  Former Senator Gary Hart, well you wrote a letter to Iran saying the U.S.
[01:51:42.703 --> 01:51:47.826]  government stages terror attacks and they better watch it because we'll stage another one and attack them.
[01:51:47.826 --> 01:51:53.610]  And then he first denied it but then once they had the letter he said okay I did write that.
[01:51:53.610 --> 01:52:01.375]  So see, they operate with each other kind of out in the open thinking we're all dumb and don't see what's happening.
[01:52:01.375 --> 01:52:02.415]  And what was his question?
[01:52:02.415 --> 01:52:05.297]  I started answering it and forgot what the question was.
[01:52:05.297 --> 01:52:06.038]  He was asking about
[01:52:09.952 --> 01:52:11.293]  Nuclear terrorism.
[01:52:11.293 --> 01:52:14.075]  I mean, will they be successful if they stage it?
[01:52:14.075 --> 01:52:19.999]  And that kind of goes into the comment or the question from the caller in Oregon.
[01:52:21.198 --> 01:52:25.301]  I don't know, but the globalists are scared now.
[01:52:25.301 --> 01:52:33.428]  They realize when you read their own documents, when you watch Bill Clinton, when you hear them, that they understand there's never been an awakening this big.
[01:52:33.428 --> 01:52:38.252]  People have never been this upset and focused on real issues.
[01:52:38.252 --> 01:52:41.315]  And so whether they're successful if they stage these terror attacks,
[01:52:42.833 --> 01:52:43.934]  Blowing up federal buildings.
[01:52:43.934 --> 01:52:46.935]  Blaming it on Tea Parties and Conservatives and Libertarians.
[01:52:46.935 --> 01:52:48.576]  Nuking cities.
[01:52:48.576 --> 01:52:50.677]  Because in the FEMA drills it's two cities.
[01:52:50.677 --> 01:52:52.298]  Blaming it on Iran.
[01:52:52.298 --> 01:52:54.139]  You see all the preparation for that.
[01:52:54.139 --> 01:52:55.500]  I don't know.
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:57.481]  But they're clearly gauging it.
[01:52:57.481 --> 01:52:59.122]  Sending up trial balloons.
[01:52:59.122 --> 01:53:01.563]  Deciding right now on whether they're going to do it or not.
[01:53:01.563 --> 01:53:02.524]  And what will life be like?
[01:53:04.704 --> 01:53:07.725]  They'll stage a big attack, get people all scared to circle around the government.
[01:53:07.725 --> 01:53:11.185]  They'll start taking the pension funds in the middle of it, saying they have to do it.
[01:53:11.185 --> 01:53:15.026]  They'll start assassinating political leaders, radio talk show host.
[01:53:15.026 --> 01:53:17.707]  I'm talking national host, big host.
[01:53:17.707 --> 01:53:20.468]  They'll try to scare people into shutting up.
[01:53:20.468 --> 01:53:26.569]  And then if we give in to the fear, they're going to win and roll out a Soviet-style takeover, run by the banks to consolidate our wealth.
[01:53:26.569 --> 01:53:31.290]  The communism is run by the big banks to take the middle class wealth and destroy their hereditary enemies.
[01:53:33.692 --> 01:53:40.717]  So, it's all up in the air right now, but we're going into the greatest challenge to humanity, not just the United States, we've seen in history.
[01:53:40.717 --> 01:53:45.460]  And the time for mincing words, the time for playing games, the time for holding back is over.
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:48.282]  Let's talk to Annie in New York.
[01:53:48.282 --> 01:53:50.983]  Annie, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:53:50.983 --> 01:53:53.165]  This will take me 45 seconds.
[01:53:53.165 --> 01:54:02.351]  In regard to the calls from Las Vegas, DOD was always a signatory to the federal response plan, since renamed during Bush the Dummer regime.
[01:54:02.961 --> 01:54:08.063]  Yeah, the military that's taken over so many other countries is now crawling all over the United States in covert operations.
[01:54:33.894 --> 01:54:43.569]  And unbeknownst to FEMA reservists, you know, we would hear during bioterrorism modules that the time was soon approaching where the agency would go from saving lives.
[01:54:44.384 --> 01:54:49.847]  And in the case of like a sarin gas attack in the New York City subways, hundreds of thousands would die.
[01:54:49.847 --> 01:54:51.808]  That's right, that's right.
[01:54:51.808 --> 01:54:53.509]  In fact, pull it up in the last three minutes.
[01:54:53.509 --> 01:54:54.830]  I appreciate your call.
[01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:55.690]  I covered it Friday.
[01:54:55.690 --> 01:54:57.431]  I believe it was an AP article.
[01:54:57.431 --> 01:55:02.634]  Obama says cities may have to wait after nuclear attack as much as 70 plus hours.
[01:55:02.634 --> 01:55:05.216]  Pull that up and put it up on screen.
[01:55:05.216 --> 01:55:10.098]  Obama says cities may have to wait in nuclear aftermath.
[01:55:10.098 --> 01:55:10.919]  That should pull it up.
[01:55:11.659 --> 01:55:12.339]  Absolutely.
[01:55:12.339 --> 01:55:14.180]  This is all about martial law.
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:15.880]  Great points.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:18.981]  This is their pretext to take over society.
[01:55:18.981 --> 01:55:20.362]  What elite wouldn't do this?
[01:55:20.362 --> 01:55:21.402]  They're ruthless.
[01:55:21.402 --> 01:55:22.863]  That's why they're in control.
[01:55:22.863 --> 01:55:24.503]  Marlene and Mass, you're on the air.
[01:55:24.503 --> 01:55:27.184]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:55:27.184 --> 01:55:32.806]  I got a piece of information for you from what I know about the border.
[01:55:32.806 --> 01:55:37.247]  You know how you were saying they were laying off Homeland Security people?
[01:55:37.247 --> 01:55:39.288]  What they're doing is they're putting in their place
[01:55:39.904 --> 01:55:40.425]  Exactly!
[01:55:40.425 --> 01:55:45.050]  They're locking the American people in, keeping us from being able to get our money out of the country.
[01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:46.351]  Roaches get in, they don't get out.
[01:55:59.224 --> 01:56:00.185]  Exactly.
[01:56:00.185 --> 01:56:05.329]  And also, it'll also tip them off if a drug dealer that they don't like is coming over the border.
[01:56:05.329 --> 01:56:07.350]  They can sense I'm coming over the border.
[01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:09.532]  Well, I've talked to high-level Pentagon people.
[01:56:09.532 --> 01:56:14.335]  They'll be told, and this has been in the news, to let one drug plane in but shoot down another.
[01:56:14.335 --> 01:56:15.716]  Exactly.
[01:56:15.716 --> 01:56:19.759]  And also, I mean, everything you're saying is true.
[01:56:20.925 --> 01:56:27.770]  I've heard it before, I heard it from your show, but there's a guy called Michael Levine, and he was a former DEA agent.
[01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:37.338]  He writes books about how basically there is huge wars going on in Mexico and South America about all these things that you're talking about.
[01:56:37.338 --> 01:56:39.279]  It's brutal.
[01:56:39.279 --> 01:56:42.262]  And now it's spilling across our border.
[01:56:42.262 --> 01:56:43.442]  Thank you for the call.
[01:56:43.442 --> 01:56:45.184]  Robin Cannon, Last Caller, quickly.
[01:56:45.919 --> 01:56:47.760]  Hey, hey Alex, great to be on with you.
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:50.521]  You're in our prayers, my friend.
[01:56:50.521 --> 01:56:58.745]  The theory, not that it matters so much what brought down the Twin Towers, but the theory that it was a demolition nuke, does that hold anything?
[01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:07.589]  Well, you know, I know that some major peer-reviewed studies in England did find high levels of radioactive isotopes that would be involved in nukes.
[01:57:08.349 --> 01:57:10.650]  But building 7 looks like a conventional demolition.
[01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:11.810]  I'm out of time.
[01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:14.131]  Folks, we only cover the facts.
[01:57:14.131 --> 01:57:17.612]  We have criminal groups running our country.
[01:57:17.612 --> 01:57:23.593]  We have got to have an awakening and grow up and say no to it or things are only going to get worse.
[01:57:23.593 --> 01:57:24.934]  I mean, my gosh.
[01:57:24.934 --> 01:57:26.494]  The Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[01:57:26.494 --> 01:57:28.435]  Operation Northwoods is declassified.
[01:57:29.255 --> 01:57:33.479]  They're sending fake Nazis to Tea Party rallies to demonize us.
[01:57:33.479 --> 01:57:38.463]  Bill Clinton's out saying he hopes there didn't have to be a terror attack in America to shut down the Tea Parties.
[01:57:38.463 --> 01:57:40.766]  It's a veiled threat to everyone.
[01:57:40.766 --> 01:57:42.447]  We are going into slavery.
[01:57:42.447 --> 01:57:44.389]  We have to stand up and say no.
[01:57:44.389 --> 01:57:46.090]  See you back tomorrow at live 11 a.m.
[01:57:46.090 --> 01:57:47.572]  at Infowars.com.
[01:57:47.572 --> 01:57:48.453]  Great job, crew.
