[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:11.000 --> 00:29.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:29.000 --> 00:31.000]  Meet your new overlords.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  Whether you are a man, woman or child,
[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  you will obey these pronouns.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  This poor little first grader who said hello to the boy
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  using his boy's name was chastised on the playground
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  and then later called out of class
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  and sent to the principal's office
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  because she did not use the correct pronoun.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  Respecting the fact that we are now a state
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  recognizing the non-binary designation as a gender,
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  he and she, we are now merging them
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  so that we are using what my grammar teacher
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  would have had a heart attack over.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  We are using the phrase they.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  But there's a principle at stake here
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  that you're ignoring for political reasons
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  and I'm a little surprised that you are.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.000]  And that is a really simple one.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.000]  It's called free speech
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  and you have the right to express your view.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  And if other people don't like it, they don't like it.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  But you can't be put in prison for saying what you think is true.
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  And this bill seems to ignore that long-standing right
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  that we've enjoyed and I find it terrifying for that reason.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  And I knew you were going to say that.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  I will contend that these are employees.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  They are regulated by the government.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  People have sincerely held religious views about gender
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  that are not based on malice or hatred.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  But this view, Bill, seeks to make their view of gender illegal.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  Now, I know you all believe in the First Amendment
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  or you say you do.
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.000]  And here's my question.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  How can you believe in free speech
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  if you think the government can compel people
[02:02.000 --> 02:05.000]  to use certain pronouns when talking to others
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  as this bill proposes?
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  Compelled speech is not free speech.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  As the federalist reported,
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  the Supreme Court of Canada ordered that a 14-year-old girl
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  receive testosterone injections without parental consent.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  The court also declared that if either of her parents
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  refer to her using female pronouns
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  or addressed her by her birth name,
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.000]  they would be considered guilty of family violence.
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.000]  As previously reported,
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  Maxine was encouraged by her school counselor
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  in British Columbia's Delta School District
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  to identify as a boy while in seventh grade.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  When Maxine was 13 years old,
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  Dr. Brendan Hirsch and his colleagues
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  at B.C. Children's Hospital decided that Maxine
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  should begin taking testosterone injections
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  in order to develop a more masculine appearance.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  As Canada slides down the slippery slope,
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  Lifesite News reported in June of 2017,
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  Canada's Senate passed the Justin Trudeau
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  Liberals Transgender Rights Bill.
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.000]  The bill adds gender expression and gender identity
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  to Canada's human rights code
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  and to the criminal code's hate crime section.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  Jack Fonseca, Campaign Life Senior Political Strategist,
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  said the bill will be used to attack Christian beliefs.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  Mark my words, he said,
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  this law will not be used as some sort of shield
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  to defend vulnerable transsexuals,
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  but rather as a weapon with which to bludgeon
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  people of faith and free-thinking Canadians
[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  who refuse to deny truth.
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  Furthermore, the time-emorial tradition of the Olympics
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  are on the verge of collapsing due to a gray area of illegitimacy
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  after the trans movement, fueled by PC culture,
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  invaded the ranks of female Olympians.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  But when it comes to sport,
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  when it comes to who's the fastest,
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  who's the strongest when you're running around
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  a 400-meter track,
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  that basically, from gender fluidity,
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  we're back to two biological sexes
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  in which those who are born male have a distinct advantage.
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  Where are they going wrong on that?
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  Well, first of all, biology is actually quite complex.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Connecticut junior Selena Sol won't be competing
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  in the 55-meter dash.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  She was edged out of the top six spots
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  in part by two transgender runners,
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  Andrea Yearwood and Terry Miller,
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  both male at birth, now identifying as female.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  Terry set a girl's state indoor record,
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  Andrea came in second.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  It's frustrating and, in a way,
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  demoralizing when you're at the start line of a race
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  and you know what the outcome of the race is
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.000]  before it even happens.
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.000]  They have naturally testosterone within their body
[04:52.000 --> 04:55.000]  that has been proven to give.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  Well, I've got some really good news
[05:02.000 --> 05:03.000]  for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  This was going to be a big loss
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  because we couldn't get the deep-earth crystals anymore.
[05:07.000 --> 05:08.000]  It's been a year-and-a-half fight,
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.000]  but we have the original producer,
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  the original crystal source,
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.000]  the best atomic iodine in the world.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  X-2 is back.
[05:15.000 --> 05:16.000]  We got it.
[05:16.000 --> 05:17.000]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  We rushed it into production.
[05:19.000 --> 05:20.000]  It's been bottled.
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.000]  The labels are being put on today,
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  and then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies,
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  and it's going to be shipped out to you.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  Be sure and sign up for auto-ship.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  Get an additional 10% off.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  The 25% off, celebration of the fact
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  Find out why it's so important.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  Find out why the globalists don't want you to have
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  the good halogens and what you have the bad halogens.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  At infowarstore.com, that's the umbrella site,
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  infowarstlife.com.
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.000]  They should write the supplements,
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  and this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  It is X-2 original.
[05:55.000 --> 06:05.000]  Now back at infowarstore.com.
[06:25.000 --> 06:34.000]  Just a few minutes ago, before we went live,
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  I had an emergency phone call from Tommy Robinson.
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  He's had leftist anti-foot groups that obviously worked for MI5.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  That's come out in internal videos and documents.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  In camp around his home, threatening his family,
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  the police are staked out down the street
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  with surveillance equipment,
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  distancing everything happening in his house,
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  desperately trying to set him up and sending him back to prison
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  for exposing the giant child kidnapping rings
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  that have now been brought down to a great extent nationwide.
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  Tens of thousands of children freed in the last two years
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  thanks to Tommy Robinson, a living hero.
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  And he doesn't want me to show you the footage yet
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  because he's checking some legal issues,
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.000]  but he has the police caught,
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  staked out working with the terrorist,
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  and again, earlier last week,
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  he released exclusive documentary
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  that was seen millions and millions of times in one day on Facebook.
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  His Facebook was deleted, so was his Instagram.
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  And the documentary we re-uploaded at infowars.com
[07:40.000 --> 07:47.000]  shows undercover BBC reporters saying that they were going to try to set
[07:47.000 --> 07:52.000]  Tommy Robinson up and have women make false sexual allegations against him.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  And I know they've been offering people money to do that to me as well.
[07:57.000 --> 08:07.000]  And you have to understand this is criminal.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  What they're doing.
[08:09.000 --> 08:15.000]  This is absolutely criminal what they're doing.
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  And it's very, very dangerous.
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  And it's the model of how you have intelligence agencies
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  with corrupt corporate media and then activists that act as the go-between
[08:26.000 --> 08:31.000]  to carry out the on-the-ground racketeering.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  This is organized crime.
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  And we've already put up with the IRS and the British IRS
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  persecuting patriots and nationalists.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  We've already put up with all the legal spine.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  We've already put up with the censorship.
[08:41.000 --> 08:46.000]  Next comes the physical attacks.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  Next comes the shutdown of society.
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  So he was scheduled to be on in the second hour.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  I'm not even sure if he'll be able to be here now.
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  I'll be talking to him obviously during the breaks,
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  but this is fast-moving news.
[08:57.000 --> 09:06.000]  He sent myself and the producer.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  And guys, I was going to ignore it.
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  We go to break, but you guys have got a feed coming to my ear.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  I can only handle five minutes of it.
[09:14.000 --> 09:17.000]  So I just have to tell you on the air, please kill it.
[09:17.000 --> 09:24.000]  So again, I saw that exclusive footage, very shocking.
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  And he may let us play it next hour if he's even here next hour.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  That said, Paul Joseph Watson is here in the United States,
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.000]  speaking of England.
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  He is in the green room.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  He's got a lot of big breaking news coming out at the bottom of the hour.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  So you'll definitely want to join us for the latest on Brexit,
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  the latest on the Islamification of Europe,
[09:42.000 --> 09:52.000]  the latest on censorship, the latest on inside baseball with Trump.
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  And so that is all going to be coming up on the broadcast here today.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  We're coming to you from the new studios here in Austin, Texas
[10:01.000 --> 10:08.000]  on the syndicated radio slash television broadcast.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  Some of the biggest news, obviously, is that the border is being purposely destroyed.
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  And instead of fixing it, we just have a debate about whether there's a problem or not forever.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  It's kind of like debating whether your cell phones are spying on you
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  instead of admitting they spy on you.
[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  And then once it's admitted, it's already ubiquitous.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  And it's the same tactic about where autism is coming from and why it's getting so bad.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  When they have all the studies and we know they just keep having a debate about
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  whether the vaccines are triggering autoimmune responses in the gut and the brain
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.000]  and causing autism.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  We're going to be getting to all that.
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.000]  And then meanwhile, the criminalization of dissent against globalism and globalist invasion
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  is becoming illegal all over the world.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  Dozens arrested for erecting anti migrant Christian cross in Greece.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  The cross is seen as hurtful to Muslims.
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  And so no public crosses, Germany, Sweden and others have been ordering churches to remove
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  some cases, 1000 year old crosses.
[11:03.000 --> 11:09.000]  I'm not joking to info wars.com article by Ben Warren with links to mainstream news
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  saying it's a wonderful thing to take down the crosses.
[11:13.000 --> 11:21.000]  And obviously the whole Russiagate situation has completely fallen apart.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  And they've had to admit that that's all a big joke and Mueller's reports said to come out this week.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  They're now saying it was set to come out March 1st.
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  They keep moving the gold post, but now they've moved on to everything but Russia and all these other criminal investigations.
[11:34.000 --> 11:41.000]  And they use the illegal Russia investigation as the dragnet so that they would be able to then scoop up
[11:41.000 --> 11:47.000]  anything and everything on associates of Trump that threaten them with prosecution for things like income tax evasion
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  if they don't come out and bear false witness against the president.
[11:51.000 --> 12:00.000]  And again, it's also a domino effect or snowball effect where they have one woman come out and make false allegations against the president
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  and his nominee.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  They did the Trump end to his Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  And then another woman, another woman, another woman, another woman.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  And then the women go, oh, we just made it up because he's a Trump supporter.
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.000]  He deserves it, very, very dangerous situation.
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  We're going to be looking at all of that coming up as well as the House Democrats launch, quote, aggressive new probes.
[12:22.000 --> 12:28.000]  And Mr. Schiff in the committee in the House that's going to be overseeing this.
[12:28.000 --> 12:36.000]  He's hired a former prosecutor to go after President Trump and try to derail the nationalist agenda.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  So that's coming up as well today.
[12:39.000 --> 12:46.000]  The first thing I want to hit, though, when we come back is Joe Rogan knocking it out of the park.
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  And I'm not saying that Joe Rogan hit it out of the park because he had me on his podcast.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  He hit it out of the park.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  This is what everybody wanted.
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  He had Jack Darcy on Jack Dorsey of Twitter.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  And he told me last week at dinner he was going to have Mon Tuesday, but I had to sit on that.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  And then all of a sudden we're like, hey, he said he'd go live about noon or so.
[13:09.000 --> 13:17.000]  But he went live about two central with Jack Dorsey and Jack Dorsey's mother, Vajaya Gade.
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.000]  His mommy was there to hold his hand and make sure that he was a good little boy.
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.000]  And it was just unparalleled lies and BS and Joe tore them apart.
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  And so did journalist Tim Poole, who I'm very impressed with.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  Followed his work for many years.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  Now he's more of a leftist than he's criticized.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  I mean, that's fine.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  But he does get how the censorship really works and how it's being implemented and how it's
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  really a campaign violation, campaign finance violation because they don't let conservatives,
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  libertarians have speech for everybody else can.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  Very powerful two-hour interview.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  I ended up watching most of it last night when I got home.
[13:54.000 --> 14:00.000]  We've got some excerpts of that because the woman does it again.
[14:00.000 --> 14:08.000]  Vajaya Gade, the counsel, the lawyer of Twitter says that I assaulted a child.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  She says I was mean to a child.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  And that's why I was taken off.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  You know, what a stupid lie.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  But see, it just hangs out there.
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  They never say who the child is.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  They never show a clip.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  They just, he hurt a child.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  And it's like, do I have to sue you?
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  I don't want to be an adversary with you, lady.
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  But my God, I showed a clip that was on ABC, CBS, NBC, everywhere of the big 10-year-old
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  hitting the adult over and over again so the adult pushes him down.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  We had a debate about it like everybody else did.
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.000]  But they chose that, took me off YouTube for that.
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  And then she came to me and get it straight and says I was taken off Twitter for that.
[14:49.000 --> 14:56.000]  And then she says I was mean to Oliver Darcy, the rat-like creature, and chose to start laughing.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  He goes, that's a public figure.
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  She called him a rat because he goes around getting people taken off the Internet.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  She goes, well, it was very hurtful.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  So they let Islamic groups, talk about how they're going to murder Christians and everything on Twitter all day long,
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  they work with Islamic countries to censor and track people.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  A bunch of different people like Michelle Malkin and others are being told, you know,
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  watch what you post on Facebook or Twitter in Islamic countries because they're reporting you.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  You've got to follow Pakistani law.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  I mean, it's happening to everybody right now.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  These people are rampant censors.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  And the left is allied with radical Islam.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  They have been for 100 years.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  So that's coming up.
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  It's powerful.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  And this is what people wanted from Joe.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  It was real questions and real answers.
[15:40.000 --> 15:47.000]  And it was like a suicide mission for Jack and for his mommy, the Jaya God, to go on there.
[15:47.000 --> 15:54.000]  Because it was just overwhelmingly negative. Everyone literally hates them. 99% of the comments.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  To see, I have a 98% approval rating on YouTube. You have a 5%.

[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[20:24.000 --> 20:33.000]  You found it the tip of the spear.
[20:33.000 --> 20:39.000]  So I didn't invent Gonzo journalism that we definitely take it to the next level.
[20:39.000 --> 20:49.000]  It's unending that almost every day I come in here, we're one of the top stories are mixed in with one of the top stories and have to respond to it.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  And this is very important, obviously.
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  Gaya Gade is the head lawyer for Twitter.
[20:54.000 --> 21:03.000]  And she basically went and fell on her sword holding Jack's hand on the program.
[21:03.000 --> 21:11.000]  And they just told whopper after whopper after whopper.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  And I really just didn't even know what to make of it.
[21:14.000 --> 21:27.000]  Now again, Joe Rogan got torn apart by his fans a month ago when he had Jack on because it was seen as a softball interview and everybody watching it experienced or seen the censorship.
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  So to hear him lie about it and say it wasn't going on, he enraged the internet.
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.000]  And usually Joe has about a 90% approval rating with his votes on YouTube.
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  The thumbs up.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  That interview had like 80% thumbs down.
[21:42.000 --> 21:50.000]  Well, Joe told me last Wednesday he was going to bring in Tim Pool, a very smart journalist, and was going to ask some serious questions.
[21:50.000 --> 21:51.000]  Well, he did it.
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  In fact, I got home last night and ended up watching the whole thing.
[21:55.000 --> 22:03.000]  We covered some of it here live on air during the war room yesterday and he tore the living hell out of Jack and out of Gada.
[22:03.000 --> 22:12.000]  But he did it in a very gentlemanly focused way that I mean, I wish I could do.
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.000]  So this is the Joe Rogan.
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  I know this is what we want to see.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  This is what his fans want to see.
[22:17.000 --> 22:25.000]  And Joe tore the living hell out of them, especially when you know the facts and Tim Pool devastated them.
[22:25.000 --> 22:31.000]  And you know, I don't just use words like that devastated them because internal Twitter documents are out there.
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  The information is available.
[22:33.000 --> 22:37.000]  They censor nationalists and conservatives to try to make Democrats win elections.
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  They tailor censorship Facebook, Google and Twitter for third world countries their end and dictatorships.
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.000]  And the fact that they go, oh, it's an algorithm or oh, it's out of context.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  And then they lie and say the reason I was taken off Twitter was beating up a kid.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  Well, we can put on screen Forbes retracted that.
[22:53.000 --> 23:01.000]  They ran a story that I pushed a 10 year old over in Kansas at a park.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  That that'd been on the news for years.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  Some other person did that.
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  The guy doesn't even look like me.
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  It doesn't matter.
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  I was taken off YouTube for beating up a 10 year old I've never seen.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  You guys had it during the break.
[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  I saw the article out of Forbes retracts.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  That's why we pulled it up during the break.
[23:20.000 --> 23:27.000]  But whatever, it doesn't matter.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[23:28.000 --> 23:34.000]  Forbes contributor falsely claims Alex Jones assaulted child on video.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  And then they had to retract it.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  You might want to minimize that a little bit.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  I'm just going to start directing here on their wholesale.
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  Maybe shrink the article down a little bit.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  So anyway, we didn't get to the video.
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  We probably won't get to it.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  Hell, I didn't do the show anymore.
[23:47.000 --> 23:48.000]  I'm not sure.
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  But you know, a lot of it is focusing on these individuals really frustrates me
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  because I need to show you where they retracted.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  Or they will say, I'm lying and I beat up a 10 year old.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  There it is.
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  Why YouTube's info worth ban is meaningless.
[24:04.000 --> 24:09.000]  And then it goes on to say Jones punches a child to the ground.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  And Paul Watson defended me.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  Thank God.
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  And then later they had to say, OK, that was not Jones in the video.
[24:15.000 --> 24:24.000]  It doesn't matter because now the JJ Gade goes up on television and says this.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  Here it is from the Joe Rogan podcast.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  So what was it that made you ban him?
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  So there were three separate incidents that came to our attention after the fact
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  that were reported to us by different users.
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  There was a video that was uploaded that showed a child being violently thrown to the ground
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  and crying.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  So that was the first one.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  The second one was a video that we viewed as incitement of violence.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  I can read it to you.
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  It's a little bit of a transcript.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  But now it's time to act on the enemy before they do a false flag.
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  I know the Justice Department's crippled a bunch of followers and cowards,
[24:59.000 --> 25:00.000]  but there's groups.
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  There's grants, juries.
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  There's you called for it.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  It's time politically, economically and judiciously and legally and criminally
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  to move against these people.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  It's got to be done now.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  Get together, the people you know aren't traders, aren't cowards,
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  aren't helping their freaking bets, hedging their freaking bets like all these other
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  s***s do, and let's go, let's do it.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  So people need to have their, and then there's a bunch of other stuff,
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  but at the end, so people need to have their battle rifles ready and everything ready
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  at their bedside.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  And you've got to be ready because the media is so disciplined in their deception.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  So this is, you're saying that this is a call to violence.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  Now this is 10 months after they ran that hoax.
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  Where Lester Holt and the Southern Poverty Law Center and all the usual suspects,
[25:42.000 --> 25:48.000]  media matters took a 30 minute podcast, video podcast, and out of the thousands of words
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  I said, they literally took words from 10 minutes before 30 minutes later and edited
[25:53.000 --> 25:58.000]  the words in the quotes, like a word salad, like the game where you put the magnets of
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  all the words on the side of the refrigerator and you can spell out whatever you want or
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  you know, hey honey, please get milk when you go out or whatever.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  Or I'll see you at church tomorrow.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  That's what they did.
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  I said we need to legally, lawfully, through the criminal justice system go after these
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  people.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  That's 20-something minutes later.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  Earlier I say Antifa says they're going to come kill people in their homes, law enforcement,
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  ICE, members of Congress.
[26:25.000 --> 26:28.000]  Here's where they're saying it, Twitter's letting them do it.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  That's what they got mad.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  So what do you do when you're Twitter and you're letting them say go kill people in their
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  houses?
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  Well, you just say that I said that.
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  That's what the left does is they turn truth upside down on its head.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  So again, I beat up a kid, not true.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  I said take battle rifles and attack the media.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  Never said it, lady.
[26:48.000 --> 26:54.000]  You came in there with notes, with written notes that are total lies.
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  I could take, Dr. McHenry shot please.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  I could take this Breitbart article, 200 cases of mumps confirmed in Texas migrant detention
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  centers.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  I could do that right now.
[27:07.000 --> 27:14.000]  And I could take this article and I could take words out and then have it say whatever
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  I wanted.
[27:15.000 --> 27:27.000]  I could say Texas Tribune reported detention centers and then say four officials and then
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  all government officials would be given 22 years in detention camps.
[27:30.000 --> 27:36.000]  I could take this article and take words out of it and get scissors like you do with a
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  magazine if you kidnap somebody and you trim out the word and say give me a million dollars
[27:40.000 --> 27:46.000]  or your wife's dead or your daughter's dead or your son's dead.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  You trim it out and then you create what you want.
[27:49.000 --> 27:57.000]  And she sits there with this lawyer game repeating an edited statement that A, I beat up a kid.
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  I just showed you mainstream news and that's not true and retracting it.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  And then I'm saying come with battle rifles to the media.
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  And then she gets into more of this crap.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  This is unbelievable.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  And of course the thinking is well, she's a woman.
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  So if Jones comes out and criticizes her, well, he's attacking a woman.
[28:17.000 --> 28:21.000]  It's just incredible how sanctimonious you are and how you can't even cope with better
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  lies.
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  And then she gets to the really good when we come back.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  Paul Watson is going to be here for that.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  The really good when we come back.
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  I was mean to Oliver Darcy, the CNN reporter that goes around lying about people and getting
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  a ban.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  I was mean to the portable rat creature.
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  But don't worry, Laura Lumer just got banned on the Internet too because you can't bully
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  members of the press that bully you.
[28:46.000 --> 28:49.000]  You can't even speak back to them after all.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  Alex Jones beats up 10-year-olds.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  Have you heard her?
[28:52.000 --> 28:53.000]  She said it.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[28:54.000 --> 29:23.000]  Stay with us.
[29:23.000 --> 29:49.000]  We'll be right back.
