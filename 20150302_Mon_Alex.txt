[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com, now we just landed in Chicago.
[00:06.240 --> 00:13.200]  We are about to approach the Hammond site, this is the site where the Chicago PD Hazard
[00:13.200 --> 00:17.240]  Black site where they are legally detaining American citizens, throwing them inside this
[00:17.240 --> 00:20.360]  warehouse and essentially torturing them.
[00:20.360 --> 00:21.360]  Some have been killed.
[00:21.360 --> 00:24.760]  I mean, this is out of control and this is happening in the heart of America.
[00:24.760 --> 00:27.320]  As you can see just ahead of me, we're approaching this building.
[00:27.320 --> 00:28.560]  This is the first time I've seen it.
[00:28.560 --> 00:30.880]  This is a big, big warehouse.
[00:30.880 --> 00:32.240]  There's a lot of traffic.
[00:32.240 --> 00:33.240]  People coming in and out.
[00:33.240 --> 00:36.240]  Looks like there's a gate guard down here, fenced around the place.
[00:36.240 --> 00:39.000]  All right, so what we're going to do is we're going to try to find a parking spot.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.000]  We're going to get out.
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.960]  We have to go on the Alex Jones show.
[00:41.960 --> 00:46.760]  We're going to call in and tell them about what we've seen so far.
[00:46.760 --> 00:51.200]  We're going to walk around, look at some different stuff and just talk about what we
[00:51.200 --> 00:55.960]  know so far with this case, the fact that like we said before, they're legally detaining
[00:55.960 --> 01:00.440]  American citizens, beating them and they're torturing them, not giving them their rights
[01:00.440 --> 01:04.600]  as far as being able to call a lawyer, make phone calls.
[01:04.600 --> 01:08.800]  Essentially like we've said before, this is kind of like a domestic Guantanamo here right
[01:08.800 --> 01:10.560]  in the heart of America.
[01:10.560 --> 01:12.560]  So this is something we're going to investigate.
[01:12.560 --> 01:16.000]  Continue watching for reports because we're going to be over for the next course of five
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.240]  days trying to dig, find information, expose the tyranny happening here in Chicago because
[01:22.240 --> 01:26.640]  if it's happening in Chicago, by God it's probably happening in many other cities as
[01:26.640 --> 01:32.480]  well like Detroit, LA, places like this have to exist in other areas and all we've done
[01:32.480 --> 01:34.640]  is just scratch the surface.
[01:34.640 --> 01:39.320]  The Guardian has reported that they hold people up to two days and people have died in there.
[01:39.320 --> 01:42.800]  I mean imagine just being taken to a secret facility.
[01:42.800 --> 01:43.800]  Here we are.
[01:43.800 --> 01:44.800]  It says attention.
[01:44.800 --> 01:45.800]  No trespassing.
[01:45.800 --> 01:49.560]  Any unauthorized persons found in home square property are subject to arrest.
[01:49.560 --> 01:53.940]  We've heard based off many articles that have been out in the Guardian and all this, that
[01:53.940 --> 01:54.940]  this place is-
[01:54.940 --> 01:57.440]  Put the mic up to the-
[01:57.440 --> 02:00.440]  Well can you have them up to the hole?
[02:00.440 --> 02:05.280]  So why are you guys acting so secretive about this place?
[02:05.280 --> 02:06.280]  We're not acting secretive.
[02:06.280 --> 02:08.680]  But why can't you just answer a few questions?
[02:08.680 --> 02:11.360]  A lot of people answer those questions.
[02:11.360 --> 02:12.360]  But why not though?
[02:12.360 --> 02:13.360]  There's nothing going on.
[02:13.360 --> 02:14.760]  I have nothing to say.
[02:14.760 --> 02:18.200]  So but you guys at least admit that you guys illegally detained people here and hold them
[02:18.200 --> 02:19.800]  without reading them the rights.
[02:19.800 --> 02:23.040]  If you have a question, ask Fusper.
[02:23.040 --> 02:27.640]  So he's refusing to talk to us and he says that we have to go to a public affairs office
[02:27.640 --> 02:30.720]  which is not even around this area which is blocks and blocks away.
[02:30.720 --> 02:31.720]  Do what now?
[02:31.720 --> 02:33.720]  You have to exit our property.
[02:33.720 --> 02:34.800]  What's going on here?
[02:34.800 --> 02:36.880]  You have to exit the property.
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.360]  Can I ask what's going on?
[02:40.360 --> 02:43.040]  You have to go back to home and we're at public property.
[02:43.040 --> 02:44.040]  Okay.
[02:44.040 --> 02:45.040]  Okay.
[02:45.040 --> 02:47.680]  You're going to have to go back to home and like right now-
[02:47.680 --> 02:48.680]  What's your name?
[02:48.680 --> 02:51.840]  You're going to have to go all the way to home- I'm Sergeant Patrina Wines.
[02:51.840 --> 02:57.960]  You have to go all the way back to home in.
[02:57.960 --> 02:58.960]  Right now.
[02:58.960 --> 02:59.960]  Okay.
[02:59.960 --> 03:00.960]  We will.
[03:00.960 --> 03:01.960]  Right now.
[03:01.960 --> 03:02.960]  We are.
[03:02.960 --> 03:03.960]  Now.
[03:03.960 --> 03:04.960]  Do you guys agree with torturing people and holding them without a new process?
[03:04.960 --> 03:05.960]  Home and street, public property right now.
[03:05.960 --> 03:16.960]  Can you show us where the sites are where you guys hold people illegally?
[03:16.960 --> 03:18.720]  As you can see, we just got out to investigate.
[03:18.720 --> 03:21.560]  We walk up, we go and try and talk to the guy at the gate.
[03:21.560 --> 03:22.560]  He won't talk to us.
[03:22.560 --> 03:25.600]  He's trying to send us on this wild goose chase to go meet with a public offender.
[03:25.600 --> 03:29.760]  I'm asking him, are you aware, sir, of what's going on here at this facility?
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.960]  Do you know that they're illegally taking people, holding them hostage, shackling them
[03:34.960 --> 03:37.000]  to benches, beating them?
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  Someone's died there.
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.640]  I mean, this is out of control and he's looking at me like I'm out of my mind.
[03:41.640 --> 03:42.640]  You know?
[03:42.640 --> 03:46.200]  So then they send some lady down, a police officer who's in charge or whatever telling
[03:46.200 --> 03:47.680]  us we have to get off their property.
[03:47.680 --> 03:51.800]  We're clearly standing on a public sidewalk and she's just harassing us, telling us to
[03:51.800 --> 03:52.800]  get out of there.
[03:52.800 --> 03:53.800]  You need to leave.
[03:53.800 --> 03:54.800]  You need to leave.
[03:54.800 --> 03:55.800]  You need to leave.
[03:55.800 --> 03:56.800]  But this is a bank sidewalk.
[03:56.800 --> 03:57.800]  This is a bank.
[03:57.800 --> 04:00.200]  Do you work for this bank?
[04:00.200 --> 04:01.200]  Do you work for this bank?
[04:01.200 --> 04:02.200]  Sir.
[04:02.200 --> 04:03.200]  This is a bank, though.
[04:03.200 --> 04:04.200]  That's their property.
[04:04.200 --> 04:05.200]  It says Liberty Bank.
[04:05.200 --> 04:06.200]  Okay, but I'm about to.
[04:06.200 --> 04:07.200]  You guys are all thugs.
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.400]  So then we're like, all right, whatever.
[04:12.400 --> 04:17.600]  So we walk across the street into this bank parking lot and for no reason, I mean, it
[04:17.600 --> 04:18.600]  blows my mind.
[04:18.600 --> 04:23.840]  This guy decides to just drive up and tell us, hey, I'm undercover.
[04:23.840 --> 04:24.840]  You can't film me.
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.960]  Like, first of all, we weren't even filming you.
[04:26.960 --> 04:32.840]  You drove in front of our shot live on TV, on the radio to tell us that you're an undercover
[04:32.840 --> 04:35.760]  cop and that if that footage gets out, you're going to get killed.
[04:35.760 --> 04:36.760]  I mean, what is it?
[04:36.760 --> 04:37.760]  Why would you do that?
[04:37.760 --> 04:38.760]  Sorry to interrupt.
[04:38.760 --> 04:39.760]  What's up?
[04:39.760 --> 04:44.640]  Hey, it's an undercover car, would you mind to race in the car where I drove through just
[04:44.640 --> 04:47.480]  so I don't get killed when they find out my license plate?
[04:47.480 --> 04:48.480]  Yeah.
[04:48.480 --> 04:49.480]  All right, folks.
[04:49.480 --> 04:51.880]  We're live broadcasting worldwide.
[04:51.880 --> 04:53.120]  Get ready when we come back.
[04:53.120 --> 04:58.560]  We're going to break everything down on this March 2nd, 2015 Global Transmission.
[04:58.560 --> 04:59.680]  I'm Alex Jones.

[05:45.640 --> 05:48.160]  powerful and most challenging to acquire.

[06:32.400 --> 06:36.080]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[06:36.080 --> 06:40.440]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[06:40.440 --> 06:42.440]  Can you put two and two together?
[06:42.440 --> 06:47.360]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds,
[06:47.360 --> 06:50.080]  is reasonably priced and fully legal.

[06:58.160 --> 07:02.280]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[07:02.280 --> 07:06.880]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation,
[07:06.880 --> 07:11.320]  the exclusive infowarslife secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[07:11.320 --> 07:15.720]  This ultra clean, vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over
[07:15.720 --> 07:20.360]  the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs
[07:20.360 --> 07:21.960]  essential nutrients.
[07:21.960 --> 07:27.280]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[07:27.280 --> 07:28.440]  by the body.
[07:28.440 --> 07:35.360]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[07:35.360 --> 07:40.560]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form
[07:40.560 --> 07:43.360]  that has been created with our proprietary process.
[07:43.360 --> 07:46.240]  B12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[07:47.960 --> 07:51.960]  Don't take my word for it, try it for yourself, discover the secret.

[08:32.480 --> 08:37.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, the second day of
[08:37.480 --> 08:45.840]  March 2015, global transmission, Bruce Fine, the top lawyer at the FCC who got rid of the
[08:45.840 --> 08:53.440]  fairness doctrine, restrictions on free speech in talk radio, restrictions on being able
[08:53.440 --> 09:01.120]  to give analysis and commentary, will be joining us in the second hour today to break down
[09:01.120 --> 09:06.920]  exactly what is in this still secret FCC monstrosity.
[09:06.920 --> 09:13.280]  And the New York Times, the Washington Post, and others criticized those Friday and over
[09:13.280 --> 09:16.520]  the weekend that dare even ask for it.
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.680]  There's nothing more outrageous in this world than actually wanting to see legislation or
[09:22.680 --> 09:25.240]  bureaucratic power grabs.
[09:25.240 --> 09:30.680]  It's no big deal that the FCC chairman wouldn't testify before Congress, even though it was
[09:30.680 --> 09:34.120]  a congressionally funded and created agency.
[09:34.120 --> 09:38.760]  It's no big deal that they're making the information secret.
[09:38.760 --> 09:44.720]  It's no big deal that they've now announced that the entire telecommunications, internet
[09:44.720 --> 09:50.680]  cable systems are under their control, why they might even just announce that they're
[09:50.680 --> 09:55.520]  over print media, which is basically what they're saying, because that's what the internet
[09:55.520 --> 09:58.960]  mainly is, is text.
[09:58.960 --> 10:01.960]  But how dare you?
[10:01.960 --> 10:09.320]  In fact, the headline was conspiracy theorists have a new conspiracy concerning the FCC.
[10:09.320 --> 10:12.280]  Let us see the regulations.
[10:12.280 --> 10:15.200]  Can you imagine how outrageous that's it?
[10:15.200 --> 10:19.160]  That'd be like walking on a car lot, and there's no cars.
[10:19.160 --> 10:24.680]  And you say, I'd like to see the cars and drive the cars, and they go, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[10:24.680 --> 10:28.280]  You want to see the car?
[10:28.280 --> 10:29.280]  Just pay the money.
[10:29.280 --> 10:32.040]  You go, okay, let me see the amount.
[10:32.040 --> 10:33.800]  Oh, you can't see the amount.
[10:33.800 --> 10:36.920]  Well, you just walk off the lot.
[10:36.920 --> 10:37.920]  Let's see here.
[10:37.920 --> 10:38.920]  You can't walk off the lot.
[10:38.920 --> 10:41.280]  In fact, please put the Washington Post headline back up.
[10:41.280 --> 10:42.840]  Good job finding that so quickly.
[10:42.840 --> 10:45.080]  For TV viewers, we've got it on screen.
[10:45.080 --> 10:51.280]  There's already a conspiracy theory brewing over net neutrality.
[10:51.280 --> 10:52.480]  That's right.
[10:52.480 --> 11:01.360]  Let us see what you passed out of your Obama-appointed stacked-and-packed FCC commission, with the
[11:01.360 --> 11:06.440]  other dissenting members saying it's a total and complete power grab, which it is, but
[11:06.440 --> 11:09.080]  then we can't see it.
[11:09.080 --> 11:10.080]  That's coming up.
[11:10.080 --> 11:16.240]  Boehner Fights is heating up as folks try to remove him as the speaker of the House
[11:16.240 --> 11:17.240]  representatives.
[11:17.240 --> 11:22.320]  He is the big problem who helped author Obamacare with the neocons and the Democrats.
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.480]  He is the guy going along with the gun grabbing, going along with the open borders, going along
[11:26.480 --> 11:28.480]  with protecting Obamacare.
[11:28.480 --> 11:33.000]  And the media is just like, oh, can you believe the right-wing extremist in the House?
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.120]  Why they may even have the votes to remove him as speaker this week.
[11:37.120 --> 11:40.440]  This is just outrageous, and I'll tell you something even more outrageous.
[11:40.440 --> 11:44.400]  They don't like Jeb Bush, who's anti-gun and pro-open border and who supports world
[11:44.400 --> 11:45.400]  government.
[11:45.400 --> 11:48.160]  I mean, can you imagine these extremists?
[11:48.160 --> 11:51.280]  They don't like NAFTA and GATT that deindustrialize the country.
[11:51.280 --> 11:54.360]  I mean, what is their problem?
[11:54.360 --> 12:00.560]  Boehner is now defending his U.S. House leadership and amid conservative unrest.
[12:00.560 --> 12:04.920]  How about people that aren't suicidals unrest?
[12:04.920 --> 12:08.640]  How about people that aren't destructive of the republic unrest?
[12:08.640 --> 12:12.560]  How about people that don't have a death wish for the free market and prosperity and
[12:12.560 --> 12:15.880]  care about their children and care about freedoms unrest?
[12:15.880 --> 12:18.720]  How about those of us that aren't insane unrest?
[12:18.720 --> 12:22.640]  How about that?
[12:22.640 --> 12:25.000]  And of course, the big enchilada.
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.040]  I mean, there's a lot of First Amendment news, really draconian stuff we're gonna be getting
[12:29.040 --> 12:30.040]  to.
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.840]  Google may be getting ready to commit suicide as we know it.
[12:35.840 --> 12:41.520]  Other groups, I have done this, Yahoo, Reddit, a lot of other groups that are smaller but
[12:41.520 --> 12:43.960]  still quite large.
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.160]  Google wants to rank websites based on facts that are chosen by Soros groups.
[12:48.160 --> 12:52.080]  I'm not kidding, not links.
[12:52.080 --> 12:57.200]  That's at infowars.com article, Google moving the shut down alternative media by ranking
[12:57.200 --> 13:02.320]  sites on facts rather than popularity, wants to cross check websites against debunking sites
[13:02.320 --> 13:06.680]  such as Snopes that's run by a lady in an apartment with a cat.
[13:06.680 --> 13:11.240]  But George Soros groups have certified it as good and so it's good.
[13:11.240 --> 13:17.040]  That's an infowars.com article that links directly to this article in New Scientist.
[13:17.040 --> 13:20.200]  Google wants to rank websites based on facts, not links.
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.160]  The trustworthiness of the web pages might help it rise up Google's rankings if the search
[13:25.160 --> 13:31.880]  giant starts to measure quality by facts, not just links.
[13:31.880 --> 13:35.680]  That's right, it's not how popular something is.
[13:35.680 --> 13:41.680]  It's oh, a George Soros group says Alex Jones is discredited, there's no drones in the skies
[13:41.680 --> 13:44.520]  or there's no death panels in Obamacare.
[13:44.520 --> 13:49.800]  Or you can keep your doctor or we're not coming after your guns.
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.760]  I mean, these are a pack of liars.
[13:53.760 --> 13:58.120]  They get up on TV and say there's no side effects, vaccines are completely safe and effective,
[13:58.120 --> 13:59.840]  no side effects.
[13:59.840 --> 14:03.640]  You pull out the insert, it says may kill you, may cause diabetes, may.
[14:03.640 --> 14:10.080]  Meanwhile, Soros and the Ford Foundation donated nearly 200 million to pro-net neutrality groups
[14:10.080 --> 14:12.240]  that weren't really net neutrality groups.
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.400]  See, that's how you control the opposition, you lead it.
[14:17.400 --> 14:20.280]  And a couple years from now, once they've got their censorship in place, which they're
[14:20.280 --> 14:25.960]  now announcing, people will then stand around and blame the new Republican president.
[14:25.960 --> 14:29.000]  And of course, you know the Republican leadership, because they're part of the same group, went
[14:29.000 --> 14:34.360]  along with this last week, last Thursday, and signed off on it and said we're not going
[14:34.360 --> 14:38.960]  to block it, we're not going to block the FCC, even though they had the votes to do it.
[14:38.960 --> 14:44.520]  They're going to green light you to do this, so you go ahead and you power grab the Internet.
[14:44.520 --> 14:50.840]  So that's our top story in the second hour, the big top story that quite frankly in the
[14:50.840 --> 14:59.200]  current position the world is in, economically, geopolitically, militarily, what we are currently
[14:59.200 --> 15:16.000]  facing right now is one of the most dangerous combinations of geopolitical confluence that
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.720]  I've ever seen.
[15:18.720 --> 15:23.120]  And of course, I'm talking about Benjamin Netanyahu, who's gotten here to the United
[15:23.120 --> 15:33.120]  States and just addressed APEC, the American Israeli lobby, one of the most powerful, the
[15:33.120 --> 15:39.720]  big four lobbies out there, and I've really tried to analyze what's going on here and
[15:39.720 --> 15:43.240]  looked at it from every single angle.
[15:43.240 --> 15:51.800]  And in the next segment, I'm going to give you the macro view and the micro view of the
[15:51.800 --> 15:55.320]  different confluences taking place here.
[15:55.320 --> 16:02.580]  First off, this is about 80% staged.
[16:02.580 --> 16:11.040]  They've been engaged in this fake jousting between Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu for the
[16:11.040 --> 16:14.880]  last six, seven years.
[16:14.880 --> 16:19.840]  And at first, it's kind of like you start wrestling with your brother or wrestling with
[16:19.840 --> 16:24.080]  your buddies, and then all of a sudden somebody gets hurt and the fight starts.
[16:24.080 --> 16:26.320]  I've looked at this very carefully.
[16:26.320 --> 16:33.120]  It was 100% fake five, six years ago, now, because Netanyahu is battling for his political
[16:33.120 --> 16:39.240]  life and Obama is battling for his political life with the left that is extremely anti-Israel
[16:39.240 --> 16:40.240]  in the mainstream.
[16:40.240 --> 16:47.560]  I mean, let's just say they're anti-Semitic, and I'm saying that from a political atheist
[16:47.560 --> 16:53.840]  perspective, and I'm not saying I'm a political atheist, I'm saying I'm going to tell you
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.960]  what's going on from a political science textbook perspective.
[16:58.960 --> 17:01.640]  And you know, folks, I know what I'm talking about.
[17:01.640 --> 17:02.640]  That's not confidence.
[17:02.640 --> 17:03.640]  It's a fact.
[17:03.640 --> 17:10.120]  I know the players, I know the parties, I know the groups, but the fact that this play
[17:10.120 --> 17:17.440]  fight has now turned into a real fight and it's real, 20% of it's real.
[17:17.440 --> 17:22.320]  After today's speech and after tomorrow's speech at Congress, unprecedented, it might
[17:22.320 --> 17:24.200]  become 30%, 40% real.
[17:24.200 --> 17:32.120]  Well, 1% real was something like this is extremely dangerous.
[17:32.120 --> 17:36.560]  And so I'm going to, just 100% when we come back from break, tell you what I really think
[17:36.560 --> 17:42.480]  is going on here, and I know most of it, I mean, I know I'm right about most of it.
[17:42.480 --> 17:50.560]  I've got to speculate on a few areas that are obscured from view, but from past analysis,
[17:50.560 --> 17:54.480]  and I think it's time to just see even the third hour.
[17:54.480 --> 17:59.840]  If Steve Pachennik can pop in for a quick look, 10 minutes, just on Israel, I want to
[17:59.840 --> 18:00.840]  get his view.
[18:00.840 --> 18:04.680]  I don't know it exactly, but I think I'm going to get it.
[18:04.680 --> 18:09.960]  When I call Joel Scousen of World Affairs brief, I really respect him as well.
[18:09.960 --> 18:12.800]  I only want a five, 10 minute pop in from both men.
[18:12.800 --> 18:14.960]  I just thought of that.
[18:14.960 --> 18:19.600]  I want to get their take to kind of reality test what I'm about to say.
[18:19.600 --> 18:22.880]  I'm going to break this down when we come back and then I'm going to bounce it off you,
[18:22.880 --> 18:23.880]  the listeners as well.
[18:23.880 --> 18:26.720]  But see, I'm not an idiot.
[18:26.720 --> 18:32.240]  I don't just pick a side like, I'm with George Soros, kill the cops, or the cops are perfect
[18:32.240 --> 18:35.600]  and we should back them no matter what they do.
[18:35.600 --> 18:38.720]  You want to bring down police departments in this country, that's what will do it, because
[18:38.720 --> 18:43.000]  then that'll create an atmosphere of just above the law behavior, thugs will run wild,
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.640]  it'll discredit the entire institution.
[18:45.640 --> 18:48.080]  You've got to look at both sides of the thing.
[18:48.080 --> 18:52.720]  So it's not like I'm totally for Israel and I'm totally against Obama, or I'm totally
[18:52.720 --> 18:55.440]  for Obama, I'm totally against Israel.
[18:55.440 --> 19:01.920]  There's a lot of theater going on here, but there's some real chunks of meat in this
[19:01.920 --> 19:03.560]  stinkin' soup.
[19:03.560 --> 19:08.040]  We'll get in there and look at those and the different confluence of influences and things
[19:08.040 --> 19:12.640]  that are in there, because I'm going to extrapolate out after the next segment why I'm so concerned.
[19:12.640 --> 19:13.640]  Here's the headlines.
[19:13.640 --> 19:18.120]  Netanyahu, Iran, nuclear deal threatens Israel's security.
[19:18.120 --> 19:21.360]  Big Israeli paper.
[19:21.360 --> 19:28.040]  Report Channel 7 TV, Obama threatens to shoot down IAF, Iran's strike.
[19:28.040 --> 19:31.200]  You got the former head of the Mossad saying Netanyahu must go.
[19:31.200 --> 19:35.480]  See, there's an internal battle going on inside of Israel right now.
[19:35.480 --> 19:37.160]  In fact, I know you guys printed that for me.
[19:37.160 --> 19:38.160]  Oh, here it is.
[19:38.160 --> 19:40.080]  Yeah, I got it out of the Guardian.
[19:40.080 --> 19:43.600]  Netanyahu's address to Congress will be the most important speech of his life.
[19:43.600 --> 19:45.120]  Wash post.
[19:45.120 --> 19:51.880]  Republican Sikh coveted Benjamin Netanyahu's speech tickets from boycotting Democrats.
[19:51.880 --> 19:56.960]  Obama Netanyahu on collision course for six years in the making, ABC, or a Mossad and
[19:56.960 --> 20:01.960]  other Israeli voters to oust Benjamin Netanyahu, it's all coming up.
[20:26.960 --> 20:32.880]  This is an alert.
[20:32.880 --> 20:37.040]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[20:37.040 --> 20:41.040]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[20:41.040 --> 20:45.920]  A general steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional
[20:45.920 --> 20:46.920]  construction.
[20:46.920 --> 20:50.160]  And we're offering rebates of up to $20,000 to help you build today.
[20:50.160 --> 20:53.360]  Call General Steel for free information that could save you thousands.

[21:01.480 --> 21:03.400]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[21:03.400 --> 21:08.360]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[21:08.360 --> 21:12.640]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're
[21:12.640 --> 21:14.400]  making it easy for them.
[21:14.400 --> 21:19.080]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[21:19.080 --> 21:24.360]  The phone line, you shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think
[21:24.360 --> 21:25.360]  you're safe.
[21:25.360 --> 21:29.280]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[21:29.280 --> 21:32.760]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.
[21:32.760 --> 21:35.000]  Simply safe home security is the smarter choice.
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.600]  Built by Harvard engineers, simply safe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[21:39.600 --> 21:40.600]  Scissors can't cut it.
[21:40.600 --> 21:42.600]  And that means your home stays safe.
[21:42.600 --> 21:46.960]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month with no contract.

[22:06.760 --> 22:11.120]  all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?

[23:29.120 --> 23:34.960]  Hey Boomer, I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[23:34.960 --> 23:38.680]  Good thing we have the Berkey system, it's the cleanest, best water ever.
[23:38.680 --> 23:42.520]  Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaks
[23:42.520 --> 23:44.440]  only pure, delicious water.
[23:44.440 --> 23:45.440]  I know, right?
[23:45.440 --> 23:46.440]  You love it too.
[23:46.440 --> 23:47.440]  Yeah, I'm thirsty too.
[23:47.440 --> 23:48.440]  Let's go get some.
[23:48.440 --> 23:49.440]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[23:49.440 --> 23:50.440]  That's 877-886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[23:50.440 --> 24:20.400]  Here's some of the headlines, paper, Obama threatened to shoot down Israeli Jets.
[24:20.400 --> 24:26.960]  Netanyahu warns an Iran deal could threaten Israel's existence.
[24:26.960 --> 24:32.960]  Relations stronger than ever with the U.S. says that he doesn't mean disrespect to Obama.
[24:32.960 --> 24:43.440]  List times Israel defied America to act in self-interest.
[24:43.440 --> 24:49.320]  Election watchdog orders TV and radio stations to impose five-minute delay on Netanyahu addressed
[24:49.320 --> 24:53.840]  Congress tomorrow to stop electioneering.
[24:53.840 --> 24:57.840]  Kerry cautions Israel not to undercut Iran talks.
[24:57.840 --> 25:00.480]  Now let's just stop right here.
[25:00.480 --> 25:04.880]  I was reading headlines from drudgeaport.com.
[25:04.880 --> 25:11.120]  Let's just stop right there and actually break down what's going on here.
[25:11.120 --> 25:18.080]  If you look at Israel's perspective, they're worried about Iran getting nuclear weapons.
[25:18.080 --> 25:25.600]  Israel represented by Netanyahu who is in political trouble right now and who a lot
[25:25.600 --> 25:26.840]  of people are sick of.
[25:26.840 --> 25:29.520]  So let's be clear about that.
[25:29.520 --> 25:37.360]  Netanyahu may speak for Israel at this point as their prime minister, but he may be the
[25:37.360 --> 25:45.560]  leader in the Knesset, but he is not the only person that speaks for people in Israel.
[25:45.560 --> 25:48.960]  It's like Obama is not the only person that speaks for Americans.
[25:48.960 --> 25:53.400]  And obviously we all know that, but it's important to just pull that into context.
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.040]  Now let me get into the meat and potatoes here.
[25:58.040 --> 26:09.160]  From the hardline LeCoudnick perspective, Israel at least seven other times has attacked
[26:09.160 --> 26:13.880]  countries in the Middle East whenever it was being threatened or had been attacked, even
[26:13.880 --> 26:16.920]  when the United States was not backing it.
[26:16.920 --> 26:21.720]  And Israel tried to false flag the USS Liberty to blame it on Egypt.
[26:21.720 --> 26:24.640]  And that since come out, and the Israeli pilots have spoken out, they were ordered to blow
[26:24.640 --> 26:25.640]  the ship up and they failed.
[26:25.640 --> 26:27.440]  The point is, governments do that.
[26:27.440 --> 26:35.840]  So when Benjamin Netanyahu comes out and says that in his APEC speech just an hour ago,
[26:35.840 --> 26:48.400]  there's major, major saber rattling and Saudi Arabia is saying that they will back Israel
[26:48.400 --> 26:49.520]  in their major papers.
[26:49.520 --> 26:56.760]  So they've officially said this in a strike on Iran's nuclear sites.
[26:56.760 --> 27:01.400]  And then if Iran responds, Saudi Arabia already has nukes, ladies and gentlemen, that came
[27:01.400 --> 27:02.400]  out a long time ago.
[27:02.400 --> 27:08.080]  Israel has 800 nukes, at least, they're talking about nuke strikes with so-called tactical
[27:08.080 --> 27:11.320]  nukes on some of these underground bunkers.
[27:11.320 --> 27:16.280]  And then Russia could get involved and that's where it leads into a World War III scenario.
[27:16.280 --> 27:20.240]  And we've got former CIA folks actually in the news talking about that today.
[27:20.240 --> 27:21.480]  So that's coming up in the next segment.
[27:21.480 --> 27:26.240]  So I'm laying out just different pieces of what I'm looking at.
[27:26.240 --> 27:31.320]  So we're not just saying I'm with Israel or I'm with Iran or I'm with Obama.
[27:31.320 --> 27:36.240]  Let's look at the different interests that are out there.
[27:36.240 --> 27:43.480]  Now, to understand what's happening between Iran and Israel and Saudi Arabia right now,
[27:43.480 --> 27:47.200]  let's pull back.
[27:47.200 --> 27:55.040]  Israel shamefully, the United States shamefully, Europe and NATO shamefully, Turkey shamefully,
[27:55.040 --> 27:59.800]  Saudi Arabia shamefully, all have been involved in the dirtiest of crime.
[27:59.800 --> 28:02.600]  That's a fact, just a fact.
[28:02.600 --> 28:07.440]  And you've got to understand this point, to understand the entire compendium.
[28:07.440 --> 28:09.680]  You get this, you get everything.
[28:09.680 --> 28:16.920]  What's been going on in Syria for four and a half years just north of Israel and Lebanon,
[28:16.920 --> 28:25.200]  bordering Iraq and Jordan and Turkey and what they're going to make Kurdistan, Syria.
[28:25.200 --> 28:27.440]  You control that, you control the entire region.
[28:27.440 --> 28:29.160]  It's a key piece.
[28:29.160 --> 28:31.600]  You take the Russian Mediterranean port.
[28:31.600 --> 28:33.600]  You get the oil and gas pipelines.
[28:33.600 --> 28:37.200]  You install regime.
[28:37.200 --> 28:50.320]  There's been a Shiite, Iran, Wahhabist Sunni proxy war, Saudi Arabia in Syria for four
[28:50.320 --> 28:57.400]  and a half years with the United States and Israel, with Saudi Arabia ganging up on the
[28:57.400 --> 29:04.360]  moderate Shiite, Alawite minority that runs that country, with the Christian minority,
[29:04.360 --> 29:10.280]  committing war crimes and pumping in al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia to bring them down, committing
[29:10.280 --> 29:12.760]  atrocity upon atrocity.
[29:12.760 --> 29:17.600]  Israel has been involved in this, Netanyahu.
[29:17.600 --> 29:19.760]  And I'm not demonizing Netanyahu.
[29:19.760 --> 29:21.880]  This is a fact.
[29:21.880 --> 29:23.320]  He gave a speech six months ago.
[29:23.320 --> 29:28.720]  It was in Jerusalem Post-Headline, why we need al-Qaeda in Syria.
[29:28.720 --> 29:32.600]  And the answer is, the enemy of my enemies, my friend, no, no, no, you don't use the ring
[29:32.600 --> 29:36.040]  of Mordor, it only ends up corrupting you.
[29:36.040 --> 29:38.520]  So there are some of the pieces.
[29:38.520 --> 29:42.240]  Now when I come back, I'm going to restate that and then write down exactly what's happening
[29:42.240 --> 29:45.400]  here and why this is so dangerous.
[29:45.400 --> 29:49.040]  Because there's double and triple crossing going on right now.
[29:49.040 --> 29:50.040]  We'll be back.
[29:50.040 --> 29:51.040]  Stay with us.
[29:51.040 --> 29:55.560]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:55.560 --> 30:02.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.720 --> 30:03.720]  Another major health threat.
[30:03.720 --> 30:08.080]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink
[30:08.080 --> 30:09.080]  the water.
[30:09.080 --> 30:11.440]  Ohio Governor declaring a state of emergency.
[30:11.440 --> 30:17.120]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[30:17.120 --> 30:18.440]  single day?
[30:18.440 --> 30:21.480]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[30:21.480 --> 30:24.400]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[30:24.400 --> 30:26.440]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[30:26.440 --> 30:29.360]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[30:29.360 --> 30:35.280]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[30:35.280 --> 30:38.440]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[30:38.440 --> 30:41.680]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[30:41.680 --> 30:47.680]  The Pro Pier Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently
[30:47.680 --> 30:49.400]  minded household.

[32:01.760 --> 32:05.600]  When cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in.
[32:05.600 --> 32:10.720]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[32:10.720 --> 32:14.000]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[33:23.640 --> 33:30.120]  Let's sit back like globalist sociopaths and psychopaths and not analyze what's happening
[33:30.120 --> 33:34.120]  from a moral position or taking sides.
[33:34.120 --> 33:39.480]  Let's analyze it from a cold-blooded position and then apply our heart and logic to make
[33:39.480 --> 33:40.720]  them the right decision.
[33:40.720 --> 33:45.640]  But when you're emotional about breaking down what globalists are up to, you miss most
[33:45.640 --> 33:47.520]  of their real program.
[33:47.520 --> 33:56.480]  Again, this Netanyahu Obama situation is staged, has been staged, but there is a major power
[33:56.480 --> 34:02.920]  split taking place that is extremely dangerous, and I'm going to break that down in just one
[34:02.920 --> 34:03.920]  moment.
[34:03.920 --> 34:08.440]  Earlier, if you were listening to the ad, you heard Jakari Jackson cut a promo for the
[34:08.440 --> 34:20.120]  TuneIn app, and we'll put their website up on screen for folks, and if you go to tunein.com,
[34:20.120 --> 34:27.040]  you just search Alex Jones or the Alex Jones show, TuneIn has tens of millions of listeners
[34:27.040 --> 34:28.280]  per day.
[34:28.280 --> 34:36.320]  It's on basically every device out there, from playstations to connect systems to Roku
[34:36.320 --> 34:43.800]  Boxing, thousands and thousands of platforms, and this is a great way not just for you to
[34:43.800 --> 34:53.800]  listen to us at tunein.com and to sign up to place it on your player or device when you're
[34:53.800 --> 35:02.280]  playing World of Warcraft or you're playing these different virtual reality games like
[35:02.280 --> 35:04.600]  Call of Duty.
[35:04.600 --> 35:09.120]  The real war, if you're going to have some R&R, I'm not against video games and things
[35:09.120 --> 35:13.480]  if it's a small part of your life or sports or anything, it's when it becomes your obsession.
[35:13.480 --> 35:18.680]  If I was playing these video games or I was playing online chess with people, which I've
[35:18.680 --> 35:22.960]  done before, I will sit there in the comments and tell them what I do and tell them about
[35:22.960 --> 35:24.600]  infowars.com.
[35:24.600 --> 35:26.280]  That's just part of life.
[35:26.280 --> 35:30.360]  I talk at the grocery store, I talk at the drug store, I talk at the mall, I talk in the
[35:30.360 --> 35:36.800]  movie theater line, I'm a hike and bike trail, I strike up conversations, we're not supposed
[35:36.800 --> 35:40.360]  to communicate with each other, we're supposed to sit there on the television programs.
[35:40.360 --> 35:45.840]  But are tens of millions of listeners worldwide, when you're on a multiplayer device or you're
[35:45.840 --> 35:52.440]  communicating with someone or you're signing off on your email or you are posting something
[35:52.440 --> 35:59.840]  on Facebook, please let them know about the infowars.com links at infowars.com forward
[35:59.840 --> 36:03.760]  slash show to find the free audio and video links.
[36:03.760 --> 36:08.600]  Please tell people that we're at tunein.com and send them the link to the sub page where
[36:08.600 --> 36:14.000]  you can sign up for free right there on the site and get the show.
[36:14.000 --> 36:23.640]  We've only been on for a couple days and we already have 170,000 followers on the tune
[36:23.640 --> 36:25.320]  in app.
[36:25.320 --> 36:33.480]  They've only got a couple of our shows since last week up there and we already have 170,000
[36:33.480 --> 36:37.680]  plus followers on one app.
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.680]  And we have all these other free apps, we have all these other things at infowars.com
[36:42.680 --> 36:44.280]  forward slash show.
[36:44.280 --> 36:49.320]  What would happen if you started signing off in your email or on Facebook or on Twitter
[36:49.320 --> 36:54.840]  or other globalist platforms, YouTube infowars.com forward slash show?
[36:54.840 --> 37:01.480]  And again, if you're listing a local AM or FM affiliate, tell people to tune in to that
[37:01.480 --> 37:06.480]  local AM or FM, support their sponsors because there's nothing better than an AM or FM because
[37:06.480 --> 37:09.440]  you can saturate the whole town.
[37:09.440 --> 37:12.040]  You can tell anybody how to tune in.
[37:12.040 --> 37:15.280]  Most people have different apps or different computers or a third of the public doesn't
[37:15.280 --> 37:20.040]  even hardly use computers, so you've got to reach folks through those AM and FM affiliates.
[37:20.040 --> 37:25.280]  They're so precious because more and more censorship is coming into the web.
[37:25.280 --> 37:29.400]  So our strategy is multi-pronged, like the fingers of a fist.
[37:29.400 --> 37:31.660]  You combine them to make a fist.
[37:31.660 --> 37:37.360]  We fight for web, true neutrality and open source freedom.
[37:37.360 --> 37:42.280]  But we also move on to as many platforms and proliferate as much.
[37:42.280 --> 37:48.920]  That's a way for life to survive is to promulgate, is to spawn.
[37:48.920 --> 37:52.760]  So we're spawning onto every platform we can as we've always done.
[37:52.760 --> 37:53.760]  I've always been attacked.
[37:53.760 --> 37:54.760]  I've always been censored.
[37:54.760 --> 37:58.520]  It only made us stronger to innovate, to be on every platform out there.
[37:58.520 --> 38:03.320]  So we fight for free speech.
[38:03.320 --> 38:05.240]  We fight for web freedom.
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.960]  We spawn to every platform, old tech, new tech, global shortwave, old satellite systems,
[38:09.960 --> 38:18.880]  new satellite systems, internet TV, UHF, VHF, cable systems, AM, FM, all of it.
[38:18.880 --> 38:22.680]  And then we also try to get listeners to create their own media operations, so if somebody
[38:22.680 --> 38:27.480]  kills me or takes out my operation, already the understanding of the globalist program
[38:27.480 --> 38:29.200]  is understood.
[38:29.200 --> 38:36.120]  We then put out hard copies on DVD and Blu-ray films and things for people to save and keep.
[38:36.120 --> 38:40.880]  We then have our own independent video streaming platform, presidentplanet.tv, to give you
[38:40.880 --> 38:45.160]  the free daily show and infowars.com forward slash show.
[38:45.160 --> 38:51.040]  And then we're producing more fighters, not just out there open source, but getting reporters,
[38:51.040 --> 38:57.880]  getting crews, getting investigative journalists, developed and ready to then start spawning
[38:57.880 --> 38:59.800]  operations on their own.
[38:59.800 --> 39:07.200]  We're following the basic rules of life, and we're having victory in the enemy's face.
[39:07.200 --> 39:09.360]  And that's just some of the strategies we're involved in.
[39:09.360 --> 39:16.440]  So tune in, we'll put the website and URL up on screen, tunein.com.
[39:16.440 --> 39:21.720]  And you simply go to the site, you type in Alex Jones or Alex Jones show, and then you
[39:21.720 --> 39:30.400]  can go there and there is 170,000 people already following us on one platform alone.
[39:30.400 --> 39:35.160]  You know, we've got, last time I checked, 600,000 following the podcast, we've got hundreds
[39:35.160 --> 39:38.840]  of thousands tune in just to our free streams, there's thousands of other systems and stations
[39:38.840 --> 39:44.200]  that duplicate our streams, so it can't be measured, tens of millions of views a week
[39:44.200 --> 39:47.520]  on YouTube and then hundreds of other video platforms.
[39:47.520 --> 39:52.960]  And it's all coming out of our central systems that we've then duplicated and have separate
[39:52.960 --> 39:58.480]  servers in Europe and in other areas of the world in Asia, and we've got servers just
[39:58.480 --> 40:03.200]  sitting there on backup in case we're taken down or attacked ready to fire up.
[40:03.200 --> 40:08.400]  So we are prepared to continue to get the mission out, because let me tell you, they
[40:08.400 --> 40:12.120]  set off nukes in a major city and blaming on the patriot movement, we're going to get
[40:12.120 --> 40:19.720]  about 50 million visitors in about 10 minutes, and we'll probably go down, and then we'll
[40:19.720 --> 40:23.160]  go back down, back up, we'll probably be attacked, be shut down, we'll have to fire
[40:23.160 --> 40:27.840]  up redundant systems, I might have to, I've already got plans for this, make a run for
[40:27.840 --> 40:33.120]  the border to get out of the US, if it starts fully collapsing, not because I'm running,
[40:33.120 --> 40:37.400]  but because I've got to continue to get the transmission out, I mean, we're not playing
[40:37.400 --> 40:38.400]  games here.
[40:38.400 --> 40:44.240]  We are in a mega crisis, not just in full wars, all of us together, the whole world,
[40:44.240 --> 40:47.720]  you notice the globalist are starting wars with Russia, they're starting wars in Asia,
[40:47.720 --> 40:52.360]  they're starting wars in the Middle East, they're pulling out all the stops, there's
[40:52.360 --> 40:58.720]  a major intensification economically, socially, at every level, meanwhile, this weekend, this
[40:58.720 --> 41:03.320]  ties into the story I'm about to get back into with Netanyahu.
[41:03.320 --> 41:08.880]  This weekend, I see USA Today, and then I see the Austin American Statesman, and then
[41:08.880 --> 41:12.320]  I see the Austin Chronicle.
[41:12.320 --> 41:17.760]  Everywhere I look is police killing citizens, and is it racist, and how do we stop the bad
[41:17.760 --> 41:25.240]  cops, and creating all these new Michael Brown type cases, and we cover it as well, but here's
[41:25.240 --> 41:28.720]  the issue, we've always covered it.
[41:28.720 --> 41:33.640]  This is all George Soros, because what they're calling for is federalization of police, what
[41:33.640 --> 41:37.160]  they're calling for is more funding, just like when the CPS screws up, the answer is
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.920]  more funding to expand the CPS, then they pressure the CPS to grab more kids, when kids
[41:41.920 --> 41:45.600]  do get hurt, as if you could ever protect everybody.
[41:45.600 --> 41:51.880]  These are the paradigms they use, and I see the same paradigm being used right now, because
[41:51.880 --> 41:57.920]  of the omnipresent surveillance system that the general public has, it's creating the
[41:57.920 --> 42:01.840]  perception that police are killing people at record numbers, when if you look at the
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.200]  statistics, it's flat, and I'm not excusing it, but it's just like people have a perception
[42:06.200 --> 42:11.600]  in every poll, I think it's 77% of Americans, in the last Gallup poll I saw last year, believe
[42:11.600 --> 42:18.040]  gun crime is up, LA Times reported on this two years ago, perception that gun crime is
[42:18.040 --> 42:26.040]  up despite plummeting numbers, it's down 52%, or 51% since 1992, according to the FBI's
[42:26.040 --> 42:32.280]  own unified crime statistics, I'm just about reality, the reality is gun crime is way down,
[42:32.280 --> 42:39.240]  people think it's way up, the reality is police brutality is flat, it's not way up, now we
[42:39.240 --> 42:43.880]  criticize it and always do, and want bad cops out of there, but we don't want to go have
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.400]  a race war riot with the police, because George Soros pumped 30 something million dollars
[42:48.400 --> 42:54.640]  into it, see if George Soros is for it, I'm against it, real simple rule, I can intellectually
[42:54.640 --> 42:59.000]  break down why, he wants to open borders, I'm against it, he wants Obamacare, I'm against
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.160]  it, he wants to restrict my guns, I'm against it, he wants global government, I'm against
[43:03.160 --> 43:10.480]  it, he funds the Ferguson kill the police protest, I'm against it, he wants to overthrow
[43:10.480 --> 43:14.560]  Ukraine to start a war with Russia and Georgia, I'm against it, real simple, then I can go
[43:14.560 --> 43:19.360]  into each one of those topics and then show you with the evidence why it's bad, that guy's
[43:19.360 --> 43:28.920]  a villain, that guy is trying to mess with us on record, that guy is a living fossil
[43:28.920 --> 43:33.240]  Nazi collaborator who's proud of it, and he's giving so much money to the ADL, they
[43:33.240 --> 43:38.000]  love him and give him awards, hey ADL why don't you give Hitler an award posthumously,
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.800]  I'm not joking, if you're going to give George Soros one then give Adolf Alois Hitler of
[43:43.800 --> 43:52.680]  Austria an award, you're a joke, excuse me I'm getting a little upset now, Soros admits
[43:52.680 --> 43:56.680]  responsibly for coup and mass murder in Ukraine in FullWars.com, you can scroll down and read
[43:56.680 --> 44:04.080]  the transcript and link through to the video to CNN and for Read Zarkaria, anyways I'm
[44:04.080 --> 44:08.480]  done ranting about that, just get the word out about our broadcast, Google has already
[44:08.480 --> 44:12.680]  started delisting us and others, they've already tried to put out alerts that Drudge
[44:12.680 --> 44:16.600]  has viruses, it's totally made up and proven that way five, six different times over the
[44:16.600 --> 44:22.480]  last decade, Google is now announcing they're going to start certifying that libertarian
[44:22.480 --> 44:26.440]  conservative media is not credible and only send you to George Soros media that Media
[44:26.440 --> 44:33.520]  Matter certifies, you cannot make it up, that's who's advising this group at Google, okay,
[44:33.520 --> 44:41.360]  that's a new scientist, so understand that we can beat them, people power, human intelligence,
[44:41.360 --> 44:46.080]  you telling friends and family about the broadcast, you appreciating the fact that
[44:46.080 --> 44:50.520]  we're under attack because we represent you, we're fighting for freedom, property rights,
[44:50.520 --> 44:56.200]  family rights, gun rights, religious rights, sovereignty, common sense, local government,
[44:56.200 --> 45:00.880]  I'm getting chills, everything we love, everything we stand for, we're committed, we recognize
[45:00.880 --> 45:06.240]  the attack, we're rallying patriots worldwide, we're standing up for justice, promoting the
[45:06.240 --> 45:13.160]  good America that the world loved and they hate us, so we need your support now more
[45:13.160 --> 45:17.480]  than ever and I don't say that in a whining way, I'm going full in against the enemy with
[45:17.480 --> 45:23.920]  a big fat smile on my face loving it, I'm just saying it's a bad analogy but it's a
[45:23.920 --> 45:28.080]  true analogy because if you use the first tron, it's an excellent movie, when the main
[45:28.080 --> 45:33.320]  computer empowers its attack dog and goes all my systems are yours and he grows to be
[45:33.320 --> 45:38.560]  like 500 feet tall, you could do that for us right now folks, you turn your systems,
[45:38.560 --> 45:44.520]  your prayers, your financial support, you're spreading the word more literally, info wars
[45:44.520 --> 45:48.640]  will grow up to that size and it'll be dangerous because then the enemy will fire everything
[45:48.640 --> 45:52.960]  they got at us, which is what I want, I don't have a death wish but I have a wish to be
[45:52.960 --> 45:59.880]  real and go 110% and then if they destroy me and my operation, that example of us being
[45:59.880 --> 46:08.200]  blown sky high like the Alamo, we'll live forever and we'll inspire victory, I can feel
[46:08.200 --> 46:15.160]  it, I know destiny is in our hands, so you gotta go ramming speed, use another movie
[46:15.160 --> 46:22.480]  analogy, Ben Hur, you gotta go in 110%, fortune favors the bold, our fortune is freedom and
[46:22.480 --> 46:28.640]  not being slaves and I will fight to the death for freedom, I will never compromise, I will
[46:28.640 --> 46:35.560]  never waver, I will never back down, I'm 110% in, we will beat these people if you simply
[46:35.560 --> 46:40.160]  get that spirit, I'm not gonna belabor this, I gotta give you another analysis ahead of
[46:40.160 --> 46:44.120]  the free speech attack that's coming up, I'm gonna simplify it and boil it down as best
[46:44.120 --> 46:49.280]  I can, there's just so many components that go into my analysis, it's dead on, but before
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.280]  we go any further, I told you we sell out of super mill vitality because the word's
[46:53.280 --> 46:56.960]  spreading, but it's concentrated cold pressed, known herbs and extracts, it's just super

[47:03.280 --> 47:08.240]  weeks, that's how long it takes, once a new order gets in, we had a new order for male
[47:08.240 --> 47:12.960]  in three weeks ago, so we'll take a few more weeks to get it, female could be in, in fact
[47:12.960 --> 47:18.160]  the shortest is five to six weeks, there's only a very limited supply left of the super
[47:18.160 --> 47:25.040]  female vitality and we're doing 30% off, most people will jack up the price, 30% off the
[47:25.040 --> 47:29.480]  already discounted price right now for super female vitality because I want you to try
[47:29.480 --> 47:34.280]  it, I want you to see that we're not playing games about this stuff and what God's creations

[48:03.000 --> 48:09.000]  how long we estimate it'll take to sell out at current rates, so infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139,
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.080]  now let me settle down for a minute, as I start talking about how they're trying to
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.000]  censor us and how we're fighting and because despite the fact they're attacking us and
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.640]  trying to censor us, we're still rising and the enemy's just throwing more hooks into
[48:22.640 --> 48:29.760]  us, trying to hold us down like Lillapollies and it's not working, go back to those timid
[48:29.760 --> 48:34.760]  souls, crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you, as for me, give me liberty or give
[48:34.760 --> 48:43.480]  me death, man that feels good, to not live in fear, to know who the enemy is, to be
[48:43.480 --> 48:49.320]  clear, alright let's stop, alright let me just do this as simply as I can, I spent
[48:49.320 --> 48:52.560]  a lot of time getting into background, getting into analysis, we should probably take that
[48:52.560 --> 48:57.400]  whole 10 minute break now I did earlier when we put a YouTube out and sandwich it in to
[48:57.400 --> 49:00.600]  this whole clip that I'm about to get into what's happening with Israel, we will skip
[49:00.600 --> 49:08.120]  this network break as I need time to cover this and it's so important, there are different
[49:08.120 --> 49:15.000]  power structures, different special interests involved in the world, why is the gun lobby
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.920]  one of the only true conservative libertarian lobbies that has any power in this country
[49:18.920 --> 49:22.760]  and can defeat the will of the globalist because people understand that they're being disarmed
[49:22.760 --> 49:27.400]  to be slaves and they won't back down on it, they get politically involved and they
[49:27.400 --> 49:31.440]  give money and they give time and energy to the second amendment, they put bomber stickers
[49:31.440 --> 49:35.040]  on their cars, they teach their friends and neighbors how to shoot, so we're winning the
[49:35.040 --> 49:41.560]  fight for self defense, there's the gun lobby in the US, there's the big banking cartel
[49:41.560 --> 49:49.640]  lobby, there's the big pharma lobby, so there's the gun lobby, the big banking lobby, pharma
[49:49.640 --> 49:55.880]  lobby, insurance lobby, defense lobby and the Israel lobby, so you can say there's six
[49:55.880 --> 50:00.920]  big lobbies but really there's five because big pharma and the whole healthcare lobby
[50:00.920 --> 50:05.840]  is pretty much the same group, so five or six lobbies depending on how you break it down,
[50:05.840 --> 50:12.760]  the Israel lobby is one of the most powerful because it's got about let's be conservative
[50:12.760 --> 50:20.400]  10,000 times the funding of the Scientologist and will come after you if you mess with any
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.200]  Israeli interest, I'm not comparing Israel to Scientologist, that's another big lobby,
[50:25.200 --> 50:34.200]  it's probably 20 down but it's tiny but people fear it, so Israel of those five lobbies
[50:34.200 --> 50:39.840]  is probably the weakest lobby when it comes to money but it's got its operatives in the
[50:39.840 --> 50:45.080]  other lobbies, so you could argue it's the most powerful lobby, but there's infighting
[50:45.080 --> 50:50.440]  between these different lobbies, there's infighting in Israel, Israel's not unified, you got a
[50:50.440 --> 50:54.400]  bunch of people in Israel that are sick of the Likudniks, sick of Benjamin Netanyahu,
[50:54.400 --> 51:00.960]  there's been all these assassinations, the rest of it, Israel has its own problems and
[51:00.960 --> 51:07.800]  so you've got Netanyahu who's set for an election coming up, he's neck and neck in the polls,
[51:07.800 --> 51:13.560]  he needs this to grandstand and say Israel's future is on the line, you've got to commit
[51:13.560 --> 51:19.320]  behind me or it's all over and he could use this big speech in Congress tomorrow to legitimize
[51:19.320 --> 51:26.720]  an Iranian strike by Israel and Saudi Arabia which they've both been openly saying that
[51:26.720 --> 51:33.560]  they will work together on, so this may be Netanyahu selling a Iran strike, that's a whole
[51:33.560 --> 51:38.520]  another kettle of fish that could lead to World War 3, we'll break down in a moment,
[51:38.520 --> 51:41.840]  and again I'm not for it or against it, I'm being a political atheist just giving you
[51:41.840 --> 51:49.800]  the pieces right now, you can make your decision, we report you decide to steal the Fox Maxim,
[51:49.800 --> 51:54.160]  so Netanyahu's got selfish reasons for what he's doing, he's being attacked at home, now
[51:54.160 --> 52:00.000]  General Obama, what's Obama doing, the left, all they've got is race-baiting and class
[52:00.000 --> 52:05.560]  warfare, they're part of the globalist operation, the Democrats totally work for the big interest,
[52:05.560 --> 52:09.720]  special interest other than the Second Amendment, that's the only interest they don't control
[52:09.720 --> 52:13.640]  and they hate it, that's the only thing we put energy in to have an interest, to have
[52:13.640 --> 52:19.040]  a grassroots interest, to have a special interest that represents the general public, so you've
[52:19.040 --> 52:25.680]  got these other lobbies fighting with each other power grabbing, and the Arabs have probably
[52:25.680 --> 52:30.880]  more money than the Israel lobby at this point, at some levels, and so the Saudi Arabians
[52:30.880 --> 52:34.320]  and others are pouring money in, they're also outlawed with Israel, so there's a little
[52:34.320 --> 52:40.680]  bit of schizophrenia here, and there's juxtaposing balancing acts going on in this whole Cloak
[52:40.680 --> 52:49.960]  and Dagger situation, so you've got some of the pieces there.
[52:49.960 --> 52:57.360]  Obama wanted left cover to be able to expand a fake globalist Google run Arab Spring to
[52:57.360 --> 53:03.680]  take over the Middle East, North Africa, and actually put radicals in for Saudi Arabia
[53:03.680 --> 53:09.720]  and Israel to destabilize the entire region and keep it in the Stone Age, bring down industrialized
[53:09.720 --> 53:15.200]  sectors like Egypt and Libya, they've done that, but it backfired, Egypt and others
[53:15.200 --> 53:22.200]  withstood it, Syria withstood it, they're calling Libya a huge failure saying Al-Qaeda
[53:22.200 --> 53:26.640]  is murdering thousands of months, no that was the plan, so the military, one of the
[53:26.640 --> 53:32.920]  big groups, not so much the defense lobby, but the defense operatives themselves realize
[53:32.920 --> 53:37.520]  this big picture now, and that's why the globalists are in so much trouble, so then they had to
[53:37.520 --> 53:41.800]  act like they were against Al-Qaeda that Saudi Arabia and others had sent into Syria, and
[53:41.800 --> 53:45.320]  so Obama had to come out and act like he was against them even when he's air dropping
[53:45.320 --> 53:50.600]  them weapons, so here's where it gets confusing, if you're not confused yet, you've got to
[53:50.600 --> 53:55.440]  extrapolate all this out.
[53:55.440 --> 54:00.240]  Clearly Israel and the United States and NATO were allied purely with Al-Qaeda up until
[54:00.240 --> 54:06.960]  about two years ago to take down Syria, to break up Iraq and other areas, so Israel,
[54:06.960 --> 54:09.960]  the U.S. and others were backing Al-Qaeda to engage in some of the greatest atrocities
[54:09.960 --> 54:16.640]  the Middle East has ever seen, when they lost because of Russian special forces, technology
[54:16.640 --> 54:22.160]  and advisors, and got beaten in a bunch of battles in the last year and a half, and when
[54:22.160 --> 54:28.000]  they couldn't get airstrikes in Damascus and surrounding areas by the U.S. and NATO to
[54:28.000 --> 54:36.520]  break their back, they flipped and made a deal with Iran to double cross the Al-Qaeda
[54:36.520 --> 54:43.480]  people and to remove them and then to not bring down Syria, but then to have Iran get
[54:43.480 --> 54:46.760]  rid of its nuclear weapons arsenal.
[54:46.760 --> 54:50.200]  The problem, and Iran's had nukes for at least a decade, let me just give my little
[54:50.200 --> 54:54.600]  loose flash here, I have that from, I'm not even going to get into it, okay, high-level
[54:54.600 --> 54:59.240]  special forces people, they've got satellites and stuff you can see through the rock, they
[54:59.240 --> 55:05.320]  got bombs, now they can't deliver them probably, but the point is, you've got all that going
[55:05.320 --> 55:12.120]  on right now, you've got the CIA denying it, so there's this huge balancing act going
[55:12.120 --> 55:17.920]  on from all these different angles and all these different sides, you've got Obama and
[55:17.920 --> 55:22.240]  Netanyahu insulting each other to look good with the anti-Israel crowd that makes up
[55:22.240 --> 55:28.920]  the body of the Democratic Party, the leadership's pro-Israel, but the body of it is anti-Semitic,
[55:28.920 --> 55:32.840]  I mean, if you say you disagree with the color of the sky, they call you anti-Semitic, and
[55:32.840 --> 55:35.360]  by anti-Semitic, I'm not saying there are things that criticize about some of the policies
[55:35.360 --> 55:43.000]  in Israel, it's just vitriolic, mindless, bestial, you know, you're a Jew because you don't want
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.440]  to blow up Israel, Alex, and Israel pays you off, you know, no proof, no evidence, no,
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.560]  just mindless, we're better than you, you're a Jew, we're going to kill you.
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.440]  So you've got that group, and Obama gets huge money from them, it's made up of Arabs, Muslims,
[55:56.440 --> 56:00.400]  Trendies, you go to any anarchist to vanish, it's just, it's promoted everywhere, it's
[56:00.400 --> 56:01.400]  sick.
[56:01.400 --> 56:03.760]  The left and radical Islam are all white.
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.320]  Netanyahu's got his right wing base, he's feeding red meat too, so they're attacking
[56:07.320 --> 56:10.480]  each other and fighting with each other and criticizing each other and having Kerry being
[56:10.480 --> 56:13.480]  overheard saying things, it's all staged.
[56:13.480 --> 56:16.320]  But just like you're fighting with your brother or your cousin or your buddy, sometimes it
[56:16.320 --> 56:19.320]  turns into a real fight when you're shadowboxing.
[56:19.320 --> 56:25.320]  And so now this has escalated up, where Israel still in the south is backing some of the
[56:25.320 --> 56:31.160]  rebels and giving ambulance support to Al Qaeda, that's on record, that's in Israeli papers.
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.840]  But meanwhile, they are getting ready to hit Iran, and they're pulling back some of their
[56:35.840 --> 56:40.800]  support for Al Qaeda in Iraq, and so what it looks like is best I can tell, that's Free
[56:40.800 --> 56:48.840]  Syrian Army that's really Al Qaeda, once the US started double crossing them with Iran,
[56:48.840 --> 56:52.960]  Israel supported them for a while and kind of threatened the West to run and take over
[56:52.960 --> 56:57.960]  part of Iraq with Saudi Arabia giving the funding and weapons.
[56:57.960 --> 57:02.640]  And now that isn't going too well, so Israel's pulling back from that support while talking
[57:02.640 --> 57:09.320]  out of both sides of their mouth, and it's a giant disaster mess, and Iran has manipulated
[57:09.320 --> 57:12.000]  with Russia out on top.
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.840]  So they threw a big fit and went and attacked Ukraine, but now the West is losing that.
[57:17.840 --> 57:23.840]  And it is just a giant mess, and as best I can tell, it's now boiled down to pure politics,
[57:23.840 --> 57:28.600]  and historically when politicians and different mafias cannot get out of a mess, they'll start
[57:28.600 --> 57:35.240]  a war, so Netanyahu is more and more maneuvering towards an Iran strike backed by Saudi Arabia
[57:35.240 --> 57:39.360]  without US support, and he said that at APEC this morning, he said, you know, we will strike
[57:39.360 --> 57:45.800]  countries without your authorization, without your support, Iran will attack Israel, Israel
[57:45.800 --> 57:49.440]  will start using nukes, Russia will probably retaliate.
[57:49.440 --> 57:56.520]  With nukes we know they've got in Syria, and you're off to the races.
[57:56.520 --> 58:01.880]  So there you go, forget whose side you're on, there is no side here.
[58:01.880 --> 58:08.080]  This is a giant, you know what sandwich, and I don't want to take a bite out of it.
[58:08.080 --> 58:12.480]  And I just want to commend George Soros and Obama and the globalists and all of you.
[58:12.480 --> 58:15.160]  You people have done a horrible job of quote taking over, you're just going to blow the
[58:15.160 --> 58:16.160]  planet up.
[58:16.160 --> 58:20.560]  I mean, at a certain point, like Hitler thinking he had a plan to attack Russia, no, these
[58:20.560 --> 58:27.440]  aren't good plans, stop it, stop it, and some argue we'll see Obama's right, we don't want
[58:27.440 --> 58:33.000]  to attack Iran, they've been attacking Iran through proxies, it's all just a bunch of
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.920]  double crossing scum.
[58:35.920 --> 58:41.040]  I mean, that's what we've come down to here, is just a bunch of dishonorable people, rudderless,
[58:41.040 --> 58:45.600]  with a bunch of backstabbing as we lurch towards World War 3, stay with us, second hour coming
[58:45.600 --> 58:47.600]  up.

[58:53.480 --> 58:57.920]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist,
[58:57.920 --> 59:02.720]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life changing health benefits.
[59:02.720 --> 59:07.120]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and
[59:07.120 --> 59:08.120]  even GMOs.

[59:54.880 --> 01:00:24.680]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:29.160]  Our top FCC lawyer who got the fairness doctrine thrown out, Bruce Fein will join us to break
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.240]  down their draconian net power grab.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.720]  He'll be with us about 30 minutes and then we'll open the phones up.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.880]  Then Joel Scousen is going to be popping in for about 5-10 minutes to give us his take
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.480]  on the Netanyahu historic speech coming up tomorrow and we'll get him on for 5-10 minutes
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480]  as well.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.840]  Dr. Pachennik want to get different perspectives from each of these men.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.520]  Here's the backdrop on Israel.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.600]  In the West backs everything Israel does and always covers up for things that Israel's
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.160]  done that's bad.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.560]  In the end it discredits any support of Israel.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:12.320]  But you look at the opposition to Israel, it is a very unsavory group as well.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.720]  This is where you get into primitive politics.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.920]  You're pretty much forced to then choose a side.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:24.760]  Well, choosing a side will lead us to World War 3, we need to transcend all this idiocy.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:32.600]  But you've got Iran, you've got Saudi Arabia, you've got Israel in the mix and I just need
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:36.760]  to say Israel and the United States have lost the moral high ground.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:41.520]  But that's not saying much when you talk about Saudi Arabia and Iran.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:46.560]  I don't think Saudi Arabia ever had it.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.160]  When our governments funded al-Qaeda to blow up churches and cut heads off and take over
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:55.280]  and then sit around and go, oh, like 1984, we're always at war with East Asia, we're
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:02.920]  never at war with East Asia, now oh, we've been fighting al-Qaeda all along, no.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:08.240]  And so this has to be addressed by all the Israel worshipers.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:14.200]  If you support Israel, you need to support an Israel that's moral and that has the world's
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.000]  backing because it's moral.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.800]  I mean, I know people that love Israel who are like, yeah, it's terrible.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.560]  What ISIS is doing, I understand it's terrible.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:30.080]  But the multiple political groups in Israel backed with the West in this four and a half
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.840]  year program of turning the Middle East over to al-Qaeda.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.680]  And the argument is, oh, that's better than turning it over to Iran.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.640]  No, no, no, I'm not a Machiavellian.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.600]  I don't believe the end justifies the means.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.360]  And Machiavellian ideas always bring down civilizations.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.520]  They work for a while.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.400]  They work for a while.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.880]  You can have a man dying, going into shock and you can, with his legs cut off, you can
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.160]  give him adrenaline, he'll wake up for a while, but he'll end up dying just the same.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:08.840]  And using al-Qaeda to do all this stuff and then to also take the West freedoms because
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.400]  the al-Qaeda threat is disgusting.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.480]  And now it's led to a split between the United States and elements of the Israel lobby.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.600]  And I have a clip of Netanyahu talking about the history of the U.S. and Israel.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.600]  Here it is.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.840]  That started with the beginning.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:32.560]  In 1948, Secretary of State George Marshall opposed David Ben-Gurion's intention to declare
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560]  statehood.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.560]  That's an understatement.
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.200]  He vehemently opposed it.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:44.920]  But Ben-Gurion, understanding what was at stake, went ahead and declared Israel's independence.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:55.200]  In 1967, as an Arab noose was tightening around Israel's neck, the United States warned Prime
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:03.440]  Minister Levi Eshkol that if Israel acted alone, it would be alone.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.240]  But Israel did act, acted alone to defend itself.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:15.520]  In 1981, under the leadership of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Israel destroyed the nuclear
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:24.400]  reactor at Osirak.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:30.200]  The United States criticized Israel and suspended arms transfers for three months.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:37.160]  And in 2002, after the worst wave of Palestinian terror attacks in Israel's history, Prime Minister
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.440]  Sharon launched Operation Defense of Shield.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:44.280]  The United States demanded that Israel withdraw its troops immediately.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.280]  But Sharon continued.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.280]  All right.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.840]  We're going to play more of this coming up.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:56.760]  And you know, I'm sorry, when Israel's leadership backed Al Qaeda, Israel lost the perceived
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.000]  moral high ground out there.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.440]  But still, we're left with Al Qaeda running around and Iran.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:06.120]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:10.480]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.480]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:18.080]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.120]  priced and fully legal.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.200]  But for how long?

[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.560]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin Jail.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.560]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.560]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.560]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:42.120]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:08.000]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits

[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:26.920]  Bullet.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:54.520]  Well if Israel wants to hit Iran that's Israel's business in my view and then it's going to
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.840]  be Iran's business to respond we're going to get Bruce Fine to take on this here in
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.920]  just a moment.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:07.040]  But if Israel has 800 nukes why would Iran use nukes even if they had them?
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.760]  And now the word is Saudi Arabia has been getting them that even came out in the Jerusalem
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.800]  Post last year so they're just proliferating.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:24.000]  But Obama has threatened to shoot down IAF-Iran strike that's in the Israeli newspapers I mean
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.040]  how could Obama tell Israel what they can do in their own region well they're trying
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.720]  to tell Russia what to do in Ukraine.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:36.480]  The Bethlehem based news agency MANA has cited a Kuwaiti newspaper report Saturday that US
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:40.600]  President Barack Obama threatened an Israeli military attack against Iran's nuclear facilities
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:45.080]  in 2014 by threatening to shoot down Israeli jets before they could reach their targets
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.000]  in Iran.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.480]  Following Obama's threat Prime Minister Benjamin Yahu was reportedly forced to abort the planned
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.480]  Iran attack.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:10:03.080]  If that's true he's here selling that attack to Congress and to APEC.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:07.320]  The bigger question is is this a fake split for political red meat because a lot of the
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:16.120]  left hates Israel and yet Yahu is in an election because we know both the countries backed al-Qaeda
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.640]  based groups to attack Syria now and then they formed ISIS.
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:25.960]  Now we suppose he's sided with Iran it just looks like a giant disaster to me.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.560]  We originally were setting him up last week to come on Bruce Fine former top counsel of
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:36.160]  the FCC he's the lawyer that went to Reagan and Congress and got the fairness doctrine
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.800]  of not letting you have talk radio and quote be partisan that hey I don't support Obama
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.920]  here couldn't say that.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.040]  Google's coming out now with their own fairness doctrine saying they'll decide what websites
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:52.440]  to be promoted and linked to and Democratic party groups connected to Soros are running
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.440]  as usual.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:11:00.000]  Bruce Fine again is a best-selling author he has a blog daily in the Washington Times
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.800]  that you can find there and he's going to cover the waterfront with us here on that issue
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:14.360]  with currently with Israel his take on Russia, Ukraine but mainly the 300 plus pages that
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.000]  the FCC had won't release he won't testify before Congress.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.240]  I can't remember this type of arrogant behavior Bruce Fine's constitutional lawyer he was
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:28.880]  Ron Paul's domestic and foreign affairs advisor in his presidential campaigns so he knows
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:33.400]  what he's talking about when it comes to foreign affairs as well as domestic so I appreciate
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.560]  Bruce Fine joining us Bruce.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:39.760]  Let's get into the situation with Israel first what's your take you heard my breakdown.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:44.760]  Yes I did I think one of the first things the audience should remember that Prime Minister
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:51.360]  Netanyahu also testified for Congress in 2003 regarding the invasion of Iraq and at
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:57.120]  that time he testified unequivocally that he knew us that Abu Zayn had weapons of mass
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:02.960]  destruction that he would use them he also said that in his view the cure of Middle East
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:09.680]  ailments was to democratize the region you know as it's become undemocratized with Arab
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.580]  Spring and anybody who could think you could take political cultures that are pre-magnacard
[01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:21.280]  or pre-1215 and development and democratize them really needs their head examined it would
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.600]  be like asking Netanyahu to solve the problem on the West Bank by democratizing Hamas you
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:31.680]  know it's just going to happen and of course we followed Netanyahu's advice and end up
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.840]  spending three or four trillion dollars to make Iran stronger to hedge him on in the
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:41.920]  region so why are we asking advice from someone who got it so wrong the first time aside from
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:47.680]  the recognition I'm not blaming Prime Minister Netanyahu his interests are being reelected
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.640]  in Israel not the United States so he obviously has a conflict with the US so why are we paying
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.880]  so much attention to him and by the way the Israelis are saying that and even blocking
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:03.000]  out some of his speech if it's political and he doesn't have unified total support I'm
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.080]  not attacking Netanyahu either it's just that the right wing in this country and we're more
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:12.080]  conservative has this idea we do whatever Netanyahu says no matter what well it you
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:17.760]  know it's just not our fight now you're you're right now if I can divert for just a moment
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:22.520]  here as a joke said years ago that Netanyahu was asked whether he wanted Israel to become
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:28.040]  the 51st state of the United States he said are you kidding and lose 100 votes in the
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:34.560]  Senate but we need to remember our interests are often times aligned with Israel's but
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:41.560]  not always but our interests should come Israel's interest we have no interest in interfering
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:46.480]  or permitting our politics to be manipulated by Israel for their own domestic affairs it
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.520]  just wins us enemies however although I say we're often aligned with Israel we shouldn't
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:58.560]  be a subject to the baggage when Israel makes a decision we think is misconceived and sometimes
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:04.480]  they do after all it was the Israeli who ultimately were the supporters of Hamas to oppose at
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:09.840]  that time Yasser Arafat they can make mistakes and we shouldn't be tied to their mistakes
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:16.080]  I also think it's important to as you're pointing out to remember you know deterrent there is
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:22.240]  I think this suggestion that we're dealing with maniac in Tehran who don't have a desire
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:28.640]  to survive and that unlike the Soviet Union or North Korea Pakistan or others they can't
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.040]  be deterred even though as you point out they would be incinerated if they ever used a nuclear
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:38.200]  weapon they don't even have one maybe capability at some time you know deterrence has worked
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:43.600]  it worked in the Cuban Missile Crisis against a far more formidable adversary Iran negotiated
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:50.120]  an end to the war with Iraq by 1980-88 and when we shot down one of their passenger planes
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.440]  over the Persian Gulf they got reparations they didn't attack an end to clear war against
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:00.760]  the United States and they are they exercise real politic like others even if they're
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.320]  in balance you know even Adolf Hitler didn't use chemical weapons in World War II they
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.400]  have you know a desire of self-preservation I'm certainly in favor of threatening them
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:15.120]  with total incineration if they ever used a weapon what about the Saudi Arabia wildcard
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.000]  we know Saudi Arabia is in their pushing for with Iran more than Israel yeah and again
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.080]  I remember one I think the wildcard is a little less pronounced because the price of
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.880]  oil is plunged and we don't need so much to start the oil but there's another example
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.600]  where we are being plagued by other countries to do their bidding you know the United States
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.200]  comes first our citizens interest comes first we pay the taxes we obey the laws we fight
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.720]  for the country and we cannot permit you know Saudi Arabia to manipulate things I mean one
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.760]  thing I'd like Saudi Arabia to do is urge the president and the Congress to release
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.920]  these 28 classified documents that suggest they may have been up to their elbows in 9-11
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.440]  itself and here we have more than 10 years after the 9-11 Commissioner report we don't
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:05.960]  even know what that connection is because of the secrecy Saudi Arabia other countries
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.680]  they're all wanting us to get involved in their affairs we say you know our country
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:12.880]  comes first what do you think is really at the bottom of this because we know the US
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.680]  and Israel were were allied trying to overthrow Syria using really nasty people out of Saudi
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.880]  Arabia and other areas to do it we now call them ISIS they were called al-Qaeda now we
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:27.600]  know we've sided with Iran to try to get control of that out of control group I mean I don't
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.280]  even know if there is cloak and dagger here it just looks like a bunch of political wonks
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:37.640]  that have really screwed things up well you're right Alex we oftentimes try to impute some
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:43.280]  kind of grand strategy or plan but there isn't any I mean I work in government as well it's
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.040]  all ad hoc based upon the next 24-hour news cycle and it is it's just it's just reacting
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.800]  you know for the next next day but that and that is the problem there isn't any ultimate
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:17:00.360]  strategy there's no goal can you imagine a war take over two it was defined as the goal
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:07.320]  is to us to degrade to degrade you know the the Luftwaffe I mean to fight the Japanese
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:12.960]  zero aircraft that's not a strategy that's just we go fight to kill but there's no political
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:18.840]  objective there's no definition of what victory is and that is one of the reason why we should
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:24.840]  be out of this we are in a position where if we didn't you know basically take a bayonet
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:31.080]  and smash a hornet nest and create a lot of very angry hornets we have the ability to
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:36.120]  sit and ensure we are not attacked in the United States and these other people who are
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.480]  half crazy and fanatical they'll kill themselves and certainly since she has been turning at
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:45.560]  each other for a thousand years why should we get involved in their dispute we don't
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:50.080]  wish misery on anybody else but we got to be smart enough to know all we can do is create
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.680]  anger towards ourselves and make ourselves less safe and that is just stupid Bruce find
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.520]  the former head lawyer at the FCC who got rid of the fairness doctrine we oh talk radio
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.920]  and so much of freedom of speech on the internet to your initiative and I know you don't like
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:08.280]  credit for but you you are the guy that did that and a lot more but but he all you also
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.880]  assisted Bob Barr and drafting articles of impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:17.280]  I mean you are a guy that gets stuff done you've served on the bar of the American Bar Association
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.640]  task force on presidential signing statements I mean I'm not going to go over everything
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.800]  you've done you represented Edward Snowden's father over the Orwellian surveillance of American
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:31.120]  citizens you I mean you are a classical Americana do-gooder Bruce fine is our guest we're going
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.760]  to break here in about a minute and a half we're going to come back and get into free
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:39.320]  speech issues until 40 after when you leave us and look at this FCC power grab in my view
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:43.960]  but before we do that putting a bookend on this what do you expect out of Netanyahu's
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:48.240]  speech what do you think it's really all about grandstanding to get reelected or is he trying
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:56.920]  to sell an Iran strike he's trying I think to do both I think he thinks the two converts
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:01.480]  but we need to remember he's a politician you know it's by definition he's trying to
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:07.160]  promote his reelection but I do think that also he believes that his reelection chances
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:15.000]  are bolstered the more he can suggest he wants to take out the nuclear equation in Iran as
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:21.600]  it was done years and years ago in Osirik in Iraq I however believe that his ultimate
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.880]  presentation will be largely a one or two day affair and it's piked here in the United
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.880]  States because it underscores the divergence between a Republican Congress and a Democratic
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:38.960]  White House but I don't think the revocations will enter more than 48 hours I agree I think
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:44.000]  they're using it as just another Balkanization issue to divide everybody's like Soros has
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.560]  been caught funding the anti-police garbage also after we talk about FCC issues that you're
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.760]  the prime man to talk about I want to ask you about the Chicago black site because I know
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:58.360]  you're you're really a key on due process being key to everything Bruce finds our guest

[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.720]  Bruce fine was general counsel the head lawyer for the federal communications commission
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:36.120]  he's the guy that gave birth to the rebirth of the first amendment so we can have talk radio
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.960]  and change the ideas because i've researched this i'm not just saying this about our guest
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:49.240]  about how the FCC should operate to promote the first amendment not degraded but i'm being
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:55.720]  partisan here because it's a fact under obama we have seen an acceleration towards it to censor
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:01.240]  in control we've heard senators say use the FCC for a fairness doctrine take over cable
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:06.680]  take over movies take over print when it's online we need to protect the public from hate speech
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:14.280]  but how better to fund it than for george soros to give 196 million dollars to bill it as net
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:18.520]  neutrality now i haven't gotten bruce's take on this current fiasco yet but we'll find out
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:24.600]  as best i can tell sir you're the expert on this this is a trojan horse and they won't release
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:31.560]  the 332 pages and he won't testify to congress what is going on well i think it's a usurpation
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:36.840]  again of the executive branch of the legislative authority of congress and think of this uh
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:43.560]  rather bizarre element to this net neutrality at ruling on the one hand the commission of
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.000]  three democrats conclude that you know the antitrust laws the anti-monopoly laws aren't sufficient
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.640]  that would to protect the public interest and efficient operations of the internet on the other
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:59.560]  hand they say that there's so little need for it they're going to forbear from regulating prices
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:05.400]  and and 90 percent of what they could regulate under title two that's called the common carrier
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:10.600]  regulation so they're basically just picking and choosing the what parts of the statute they want
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:16.120]  to enforce so that's up to the it's an airmark of what congress should be deciding there's
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:22.600]  another element about the net neutrality that is equally bizarre and that is typically alex when
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:29.080]  you buy a service you can have various qualities of the provision for instance you can apply first
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:34.920]  class there are business class or economy class you're get taken from a to b but the actual
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:40.360]  quality of the service varies and you pay more if you receive higher quality first class pays more
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:45.560]  than economy and then neutrality is trying to say well you shouldn't permit people to buy first
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:50.680]  class tickets i mean really that would seem bizarre to anybody who has taken a plane and
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:56.360]  for whatever reason needed the space needed the rest or whatever to have a greater accommodation
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:00.840]  and the whole purpose there behind this net neutrality is no some people especially who are
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:07.880]  spectrum hogs who use vastly more bandwidth they shouldn't be permitted to say well i'm pay more
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:15.560]  and i need to get my uh my content that the end user a little bit faster and i use up more space
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:21.720]  and so i'll pay more i mean it's a the anti-market theory you know sure it sounds like something we
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:28.840]  hear out of venezuela and their ideas of economics exactly that that's it it's trying to get a variation
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:34.360]  of god's plan the so-get method of distributing goods and services where you have the government
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.640]  deciding you know how much and who should be paying what for what quality of uh of internet
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:43.880]  connection but isn't i mean aren't we missing the really big issue here and correct me if i'm wrong
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:51.160]  well isn't this a power grab with the FCC saying that it's now over telecommunications completely
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:57.000]  and that it's going to be over uh future development of that architecture i mean that's a huge
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:04.440]  expansion of the jurisdiction well certainly it's a what i view as the use of patience and although
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:11.000]  I claim that for the moment they won't use it to regulate prices uh uh in in in detail they're
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.360]  claiming that they could if they wish to and i want to step back for just a moment alexon
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:21.800]  and remind the audience that the antitrust laws you know they call them the the magnet card of
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:26.920]  economic liberties they apply in telecommunications the internet like they apply anyone else so no
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:32.440]  one's talking about permitting price-fixing or abuse of monopoly power that's already illegal
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.920]  and we have the federal trade commission and the justice firm to enforce them so while we have the
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:41.880]  FCC coming back and saying well we know better than the charter of economic liberties you know
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.680]  how the internet should be run especially ridiculous conclusion when it's these are that
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:52.920]  that's that's really the the engine it's the 20 cylinders of our economy that's making things move
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:58.040]  why you're trying to mess up something that's working very very well and the answer is goes back
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:05.640]  to politics and say disgruntlement uh uh with uh the way the market system works as most progressives
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:11.160]  and liberals are they don't believe in sure why would the chairman not show up to congress that
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:17.240]  seems very belligerent well not only that in my view congress has the right not only to the chairman's
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:22.600]  testimony but to anybody else's you know it's an attempt probably to avoid but it could be very

[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.360]  uh of course the president could veto it but that's a congressional prognosis and and to refuse to
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:40.520]  show up really is another example of how the executive branch has just become almost a one

[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:30.760]  first fine former general counsel the federal communications commission uniquely
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:37.720]  positioned to be able to really tell us what's going on let's go back where you got cut off
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.640]  by the break you're saying you would sanction people more and more i mean i've been following
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:47.880]  c-span for 30 years i've never seen behavior like i've seen uh from the executive and then the
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:52.680]  republican leadership seems to roll over because they're licking their lips i guess to have all
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:58.360]  this power when they get a president in charge so again i'm worried about an imperial presidency
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:04.680]  not even so much obama but i am shocked by the left that if bush was trying something like this
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:11.480]  you would have just heard howls and and now they say hey you know a lot of make obama a dictator
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:16.360]  he can give us some free stuff then uh just incredible political ignorance so so please
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:23.320]  finish up on that mr fine i mean it's a very very important uh alex in a democratic
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.160]  country like ours you know that we have government in the sunshine there are a few things that need
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:32.600]  to be secret location of truth but relatively few transparency sunshine is said to be the best
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:37.000]  disinfectant so we have a right to know what our government is doing how can we give consent
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.840]  to a government that's acting in secret and so the whole idea that in the end and when i was
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:49.000]  working as council on iran contract committee this is uh during reagan period i mean president
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.720]  reagan was having secretary of state george shulls testifies national security advisor was
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:59.880]  testifying cap windberg was testifying secretary of defense it was open in this last time this is
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:04.600]  president reagan and now we have people like you know chairman of the fcc i don't want to answer
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:10.280]  questions i don't want to show up well the congress should be telling you one if you don't show up
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:16.280]  we will impeach and remove you from office because you have an obligation to explain to the american
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:23.960]  people what you're doing and why because you are there representative you work for them not for obama
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:29.080]  you work for we the people who are sovereign and if they are recalculated they should impeach them
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:35.000]  or find them fifty thousand hundred thousand every day that they don't appear and you're right it's
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:41.320]  stunning congress says well please tell us now they ring their hand and do nothing so they get
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:46.360]  they get treated you know like their second and then third tier players because they simply won't
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:50.520]  stand up and defend their authorities but maybe you're right they're just waiting for the white
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:56.360]  house so that they can be the oppressors rather than the oppressed but that's not a very optimistic
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:01.080]  outlook for the future of the country and i don't want to be oppressed by anybody in the white
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:08.040]  house exactly democrat well also they they promised to release the 332 pages as soon as they announced
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:15.480]  it and then they haven't released it or now have the washington post making fun of anybody that asked
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.760]  to see it when we know they printed it up in book form and they've been waving it around on tv for
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:26.120]  a month with this red tape around it so i guess if they don't testify to congress why ever release
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:32.920]  it they can be like the cia will just be secret yes i mean and say secret government is antithetical
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:38.120]  anything like representative democracy how can you have a government that doesn't even tell you
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:43.720]  what it's doing after we get to decide to approve or disapprove what's being done here they don't get
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:49.080]  to issue by decree you know their elections and things can change and there's this arrogance
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:53.880]  that's that's totally antithetical to what our founding fathers thought you know a free and open
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:37:01.480]  government would be about other points where do you expect this to go the hill and i think rightly
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:06.600]  says that this has to go through a gauntlet these rules and that that's why they're not releasing
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:11.720]  them so i guess they think they want to win the propaganda war that they're protecting the internet
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:17.480]  before they roll this out by stealth but that isn't working for obama care because as they
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.280]  roll it out it becomes more unpopular by the day so why are they engaging in this tactic
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:28.920]  well they may be trying to bolster their defenses against what's sure to be a legal attack
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:34.520]  on the net neutrality rules and the court of appeals here in the u.s. court of appeals in the
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:41.480]  district of columbia has rebuked the f-16 on numerous occasions for overreach they may be
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:48.440]  worried that the shallowness of their explanations need busting before they're going to be an immediate
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:57.640]  appeal and perhaps in my expectation alex would be that they'll be a stay of the fdc rules until
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:04.120]  there's a final court adjudication which means there's years away given the legal frailty of their
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:11.160]  promulgation what do you think is going to happen in your gut i mean the sense of congress the sense
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:17.080]  of the country the sense of the other administrators and lawyers you talk to which way is this country
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:23.000]  going because it seems to be stampeding into an accelerated decline of the roman empire
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:29.400]  meets buck rogers in your gut where do you think this country in the world's going bruce fine
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:37.480]  you know what we need is to restore our fundamental precepts as a country which
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:43.960]  hasn't changed in over 200 years human nature hasn't changed you know the the empire uh psychology
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:52.120]  hasn't changed and we have in i think alex anywhere from 30 maybe 35 years to completely
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:57.640]  reorient ourselves as a country whose influence abroad is the influence of example we need to
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:04.520]  restore separation of powers back home transparency we defend ourselves but we don't go abroad in
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:10.280]  church of monsters are destroyed by 18 19 20 trillion dollars running around the world like
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:16.200]  donky hokey thinking that we can change cultures that are a thousand five thousand years old if
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:23.000]  ethnic you know the arrival reason and despotism and the democracies you can't do it you know if
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.360]  you could you know those people who believe that alex i say let's hire me build a perpetual
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:34.680]  motion machine it's truly stunning failure after failure afghanistan fails yemen fails
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:40.440]  iraq fails syria fails nowhere libya fails all of it they keep coming back and doing the same
[01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:45.880]  thing i mean after the libya is a perfect example you got 126 militias the whole thing is is a
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:50.680]  somalia like desert land and now we're going to visit the you know and the limo libya and yemen
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:58.360]  were viewed as the model that obama singled out to pursuing isis i mean my god the model that's
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:03.240]  like saying you know general custer's lab battle the little big orange is the model by which will
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:10.360]  fight the future indian wars you say my god are you crazy and we need to just totally repudiate
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:16.120]  this idea that we have some kind of obligation and expertise to cure all the ills in the world
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:20.920]  nice if it was possible we will destroy ourselves as a consequence well i think this might be
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:26.440]  was ran but if we can get ran power naturally back into the trajectory of where we're going as a
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.720]  country we can save ourselves otherwise we're following the path of the roman empire it'll be
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:36.520]  just a matter of time we'll bankrupt ourselves we'll still overextend ourselves we'll ultimately
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:43.720]  collapse well i agree with you and in closing you notice that ran paul won the c-pack poll
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:47.640]  and he's nowhere in the news and then they have a whisper campaign libertarian movement
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:53.640]  oh he's not perfect you know he's not his dad uh so we better not supporting he's the best in the
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:58.280]  field that's why the power structure is coming after him and ignoring him folks i want you to
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:01.800]  briefly comment on that because you got to go and then also have you heard about the london
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.040]  guardian our reporters have been up there there's a giant five story and then a four story and a
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:12.120]  three-story complex with black sites where people died where people are kept for up to two days
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:18.920]  shackled and aren't even put in the arrest database in chicago to then ring of these fake
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:24.760]  confessions we they send police lieutenants and others from there to then run operations at torture
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:31.320]  camps uh at guantanamo bay cuba uh afghanistan and iraq uh have you heard about this black site
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:37.480]  no there have been cases in the past year i think was one where people just disappeared into the
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:44.120]  jaws of the cia and where you were kidnapped and held for years uh uh you know legally but i have
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.000]  not uh fully apprised of what you've described there i don't want to miss the opportunity to
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.240]  explain rand paul sure he clearly is going to be the one most attacked because he's challenging
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:42:01.240]  military industrial complex that's president eisenhower warned us about no 50 some years ago
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:07.640]  uh so they'll be making up all sorts of things about rand and trying to obscure his popularity
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:14.120]  uh and we need to remember too we're never going to get a candidate that is 100 everything we
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:18.440]  agree on you know no one's a clone of anybody else he runs her office and their different
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:23.400]  demands than than being a philosopher and writing something perfect and we shouldn't squander you
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:29.320]  know the the good on the altar of the perfect stuff this is ridiculous that suggests that
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:33.880]  land doesn't deserve our support you know because there's a few semicolons and probably
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:39.320]  cues that we disagree with uh the fundamental issues of who we are as a nation and of liberty
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:44.200]  being the center of our constitutional universe he's heads and shoulders above any other candidate
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:50.360]  in the last 20 years sure nobody else is saying uh end all the foreign aid nobody else is saying
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:57.480]  massively slash taxes nobody else is doing what he's doing i mean ted cruz is a a moderate second
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:02.120]  but i don't know ted cruzman i know him we've interviewed him but i don't know him like i've
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:06.280]  known rand for 20 years i know you've known the paul's longer than that he's the real deal
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.880]  that's why they're coming after him we need to support him bruce fine thank you so much for the
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:15.000]  time thank you something that is a champion of the first amendment right there and a guy of action
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:21.800]  bruce fine very honored to have him on with bruce fine law dot com i want to open the phones up now
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.840]  specifically on the net nyah who speaks because it's so easy just to hate israel
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:29.880]  and then to look at that perspective it's so easy just to love israel
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:37.320]  i personally understand that it's a big globalist political football and
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:45.080]  and at the same time if you gave what is israel or palestine back to the people that are there
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:52.200]  they start killing each other over it as well i mean this is reality ladies and gentlemen
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:59.320]  and so i've got my beefs with the israeli lobby who tends to be anti-gun
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:05.720]  who tends to promote a lot of social engineering that's i don't like i mean i'll be honest if israel
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:10.680]  use their power to promote the second amendment here and didn't have different israel lobby
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:16.440]  connections like the adl line about me i would be a lot more pro-israel but i take the higher up
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:21.640]  i mean i look at the some of the horrible groups and organizations around israel i'm sure not
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:36.600]  signing on with that rodeo but the anti-israel lobby is is is just unbelievably bad and so it's
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:41.240]  a bad situation if you like if i was on a used car lot and there's like 20 cars and i say
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:45.160]  you know why don't you like any of these cars you know what are you a racist no i mean i don't
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.320]  like what israel's doing i don't like what the Arabs are doing i don't i don't like any of it
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:56.600]  and i'm sick of having to hear about it constantly quite frankly i'm tired of it and it's just all
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:01.880]  the big dialectic create the crisis on both sides this whole thing is pretty much staged
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:07.720]  between net and yahoo obama they're manipulating their supporters it's a real fight between the
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:14.280]  net and yahoo supporters on the right wing side and obama and his socialist i mean the socialist
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:19.240]  the george soros crowd are always super rich and they always support go after the police uh
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:25.800]  you know overthrow israel's the same it's just that they've got their red meat issues that are red
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:36.040]  herons so i'm gonna take a few calls from you on those subjects 800 259 9231 800 259 9231
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:46.440]  800 259 9231 i mean i don't like israel trying to sink the uss liberty and then if you criticize
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:50.840]  that you get called anti-semitic no i'm against false flags our government has staged a bunch
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:59.400]  of false flags people in our government bobby kennedy rfk it was declassified six seven years
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:05.160]  ago was even on front line wanted to blow up the us embassy in Honduras and blame uh his political
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:11.560]  enemies i think bobby kennedy was a pretty good guy in a lot of ways but his brother said no we're
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:15.880]  not going to blow up the embassy and kill people but that's how you start thinking up there at the
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:21.800]  top well if i do this i can blame this and then it'll save all these lives false flags are going on
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:31.000]  you better believe it uh and um but but fast forwarding when our government does a false
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:36.520]  flag or elements of it i don't then hate america so israel's been involved with some nasty stuff
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:45.160]  do you just blame israel ol hog israel's about eight different political parties three big ones
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:48.760]  the political parties are always killing each other just like the arab's are always killing
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:54.360]  each other i mean israel isn't one monolithic structure is what i'm saying and i and i'm not
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:47:01.800]  even defending or apologizing for israel i'm just sick and tired of people that don't stand
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:08.600]  up for the second amendment or sovereignty or or anti gmo all they do is run around bashing israel
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:14.440]  all day and on the other end you've got people to do nothing but support israel all day as if
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:21.000]  israel is the center of the known universe and i'm just tired of it and i don't like the fact
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.200]  that they hand out m16s to israelis to protect themselves and then the israel lobby gives money
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:30.440]  you can look it up to restrict the second amendment i'm angry about that i'm calling israel out i want
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:36.360]  to stop i have a right to defend myself netanyahu just like you have a right to defend yourself
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.440]  and if you think iran's got nukes and you think you can deal with it then do something about it but
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:49.080]  it's all part of this globalism too where i don't like obama and i kind of like seeing him be
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:53.800]  criticized but it is weird to have a foreign leader in the congress criticizing your president
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.200]  i mean are you going to see obama go over there to the kinesit and criticize the vizier manet
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:10.120]  nyahu it just the whole thing stinks to high heaven and i wish that i could be more supportive
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:14.760]  of israel i was a big israel supporter growing up big israel supporter when i was first on air
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:19.560]  everybody knows that the clips are out there because i saw the un and the globalist and
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:26.200]  soros type groups always funding anti-israel stuff so i thought well the un's against israel i must
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:32.360]  be for it but then all bunch of israel lobbies have ever done is try to destroy me so i'm just
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:41.480]  kind of like well that's not very nice so um it's a sick situation it's a complex situation
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:46.680]  but i'm not going to be a hater and i'm not going to hate the Arabs i'm not going to hate the muslims
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:50.200]  i'm not going to hate the israelis i'm not going to hate anybody i'm just going to promote freedom
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:56.680]  common sense private property and my right to defend myself and anybody comes after those freedoms
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:01.000]  i'm coming after you politically and you can say i'm a racist all day long or anti-semitic or whatever
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:08.040]  i don't care i want stability i want prosperity i want a future i believe in humanity every
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:14.040]  cell whether they be palestinian or israeli or german or chinese or mexican i want everybody to

[01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:20.120]  or visit oneworldway.com
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:33.000]  All right here's the deal we're gonna have open phones and news to the bottom of the next hour
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:38.840]  then popping in is world affairs brief editor Joel Scowson to give his take on the Netanyahu
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:47.560]  visit and then we've got dr. Steve Pacinac with his view Pacinac is Jewish and is not a fan of
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:51.640]  Israel at the same time i don't know what his view overall is going to be let's say he's not a fan of
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:58.200]  Netanyahu so we'll get two perspectives from people i know will tell us what they really think
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:05.640]  it is a mess though man i hope Netanyahu doesn't attack Iran just for political points
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:11.720]  i mean if Netanyahu hadn't come out with that fake WMD stuff i'd believe him a lot more
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:18.200]  i just know this the Pentagon says don't hit Iran and you heard fine earlier he's a really smart
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:23.640]  guy saying they don't have nukes that's the CIA's baloney i have talked to high-level people who i
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:30.440]  trust and they say look they got them and they've had them for a long time there are a lot of nukes
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:34.920]  out there folks Saudi Arabia i told just six seven years ago they had them and then last year they
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:41.000]  said we're getting nukes and we probably already have them Saudi Arabia i just don't want to have
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:49.880]  a nuclear war this is not 1980 you know with israel hitting iraq's reactor but if the iranians get
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:55.720]  mad and blow stuff up as a response israel knows they'll get more support and then the government
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:01.080]  could take more liberties here so that's why four tyrants that are above our governments the special
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:06.680]  interests that make money off war this is a good move to start a big war with iran but if you go too
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.480]  far we'll have a nuclear war and everybody's dead then that kind of screw stuff up kind of messes up
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:23.480]  the apple cart doesn't it dana into mexico go ahead you're on the air hi alex listen i wanted
[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:36.840]  to make the point that i had to come come into a mindset that just because israel um they're corrupt
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:41.160]  just like our government is that doesn't mean that the people of israel are bad and i know that's
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:46.360]  not what you're saying absolutely no exactly i'm saying israel has its own problems but i'm not part
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:52.360]  of the religion of hating israel exactly and i think a lot of believers are not opening their
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:59.320]  heads up to the fact that we you know that god says those that bless bless israel will be blessed
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:05.160]  and those that curse is well we're not going against that we're just opening our minds up to those
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.240]  facts that we're having an awakening and so people need to ask themselves that just just regarding
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:15.720]  well look at the bible look look at how god would criticize and admonish israel with israel had bad
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:21.720]  kings or bad leaders it's not god being bad criticizing israel i mean is god god or is israel
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:27.880]  god i think that's what it comes down to exactly and i just want to make you know make that clear
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:34.520]  to other people that they need to open their minds up to that so and i want to let you know that you
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:41.960]  have many many people praying for you and your safety is of your whole crew so you know what it's
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:47.960]  not it's beyond believing in prayer i rely on i totally know it's real thank you so much your
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:54.760]  sweetheart and god bless you dana blake in texas you're on the air go ahead alex yeah i just wanted
[01:57:54.760 --> 01:58:03.560]  to kind of i guess riff off of dana's comment regarding israel um the you know the the situation
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:09.960]  i think we have is that israel is not israel i mean yeah the you know the bible says to support
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:15.560]  israel but not under any circumstances and certainly not when israel has been hijacked
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:22.680]  just like america has i think one message we need to get out to christians is um that um like look
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:30.520]  look at the health basket committee um that was that's israel's um version of the the death panels
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:36.040]  that obama care has where they determine what medical procedures are paid for by the israeli
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:39.720]  government well they voted recently i tell you what stay there i'm gonna come back to you don't

[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:21.480]  um i i recently floored there's a texas senator he could not believe this fact that i told him
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:26.600]  he could not believe it and i think that this could be the key to turning around the the
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:35.800]  vaccine battle that we had it's wi-38 anyone sitting at your computer just google wi-38
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:42.280]  what it is is it's um it's a component of the root of the mmr is um the root you know the
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:50.520]  rubella component um what they do is they um they take uh um boarded fetal cells yes from a fetus
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:56.200]  you know about that yeah it's it's and it's it's it's it's frankly disgusting but this senator
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:02.520]  here in texas could not he did he thought that that we just had religious exemptions uh for
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:06.680]  you know weird religious groups or something like that we need to push that out to the pro-life
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:13.000]  community that that you were if you are taking a vaccine particularly mmr there's several others
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:20.040]  uh the chances chances are you're actually injecting your child with cell lines from an
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:28.040]  aborted fetus and it only comes from white caucasian dead girls yeah exactly exactly who
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:32.760]  happens the mother happened to have rubella or hepatitis by the way let's be clear this is from
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:37.320]  dead children not not just because they say it's not a baby in the one well no this is dead little
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:44.360]  girls yeah exactly and it's in it's in what i said this senator was um documents from the FDA
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:50.200]  it says human diploid lung fiber blast and then you actually why are you being racist against
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:57.560]  three-year-old girls it's an honor that they get to be ground up and put into this what's wrong
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:03.320]  with that children absolutely absolutely but you know i mean i gotta tell you alex he could not
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:09.320]  believe it he was he was he was completely in support of people don't believe that pepsi
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:15.880]  grows off dead baby cells their their flavor testers exactly it's exactly the same type of
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:20.440]  technology exactly the same type of technology and you know what we've all been ejected with it if
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:26.520]  you've had mmr you have aborted fetal cells or components or dna from that which is so bad for
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.040]  you folks i mean everybody knows you don't want to have a bunch of sexual partners because you can
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:38.520]  get all sorts of cancer viruses and stuff from them what about injecting it seriously i i alex i
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:43.320]  think that i think we can win the vaccine battle if we expose it you know you made a great point
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:48.600]  i'll do a special report on this in the next few days because i'd forgotten about wi-38 in fact i
[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:54.040]  didn't even know what was called wi-38 there are let me don't exaggerate hundreds of procedures
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:57.400]  i've read about that probably means there's thousands because i don't know hardly anything
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.880]  that's just so frustrating it's always much worse than i know that for like 50 years they've been
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:06.360]  grinding up dead baby parts and growing them and then growing them in cultures and then mixing them
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:11.720]  with other animal parts and i mean and then just all these viruses are in there i mean it's so over
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:17.400]  the top i knew they were taking lung tissue from dead little girls and uh you for some reason only
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:22.040]  works with caucasians and putting it into the vaccines and i knew it was causing all sorts of
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:27.240]  mutations and really screwing people up but uh absolutely we need to start exposing this
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:34.760]  yeah yeah i i listen i turned around i've turned around a lot of people on just this one issue
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:40.840]  and uh what what what what i i've come to uh uh understand is that listen if you're not if you
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:45.160]  don't work with the cbc they're not going to listen to you about science you know they're
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:49.080]  not going to listen to you about the science of it but if you can expose this one issue if you
[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:53.640]  expose that there's dead little girls in the vaccine um then you can get somebody to wake up
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:59.960]  absolutely keep doing it brother thank you blake and how dare you not want israel to abort Jewish
[02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:05.800]  babies now you're racist the government's department of homeland security is buying up loads of ammo

[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:39.480]  for lying about nigerian deals he made back in the 80s
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:47.160]  so the political class are fighting with each other just like in israel
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:50.200]  so
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:56.040]  former masod head urges israel voters to alice benzeman yet and they all who this is a horribly
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:01.400]  is just a bunch of political groups fighting with each other why do we need to be involved
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:04.920]  we're sick of the bushes we're sick of the clinton's
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:11.160]  how long's benzeman yet and y'all who've been around he's been prime minister three times
[02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:21.000]  six different times it's like kim jones years nine long i i am sick of the same people over
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.360]  and over we need fresh blood new blood we need to get these political classes out of there
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:29.640]  and these political classes i don't care the democrat or republican
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:35.800]  they're taking people's basic freedoms over in israel they've been restricting freedom more and more
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:44.360]  you know why i support a country is when they're a free country that that's how i judge a tree by
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:51.000]  its fruits and i judge these political parties is lacking and that's why they want to keep
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:57.240]  stirring up wars with unsavory groups is because it then gives them the pretext of power grab
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:01.720]  in the name of fighting the outside threat just like we're told we got to give our freedoms up
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:08.200]  now because of al-qaeda which is now isis and then meanwhile i'm going to raise this with bruce fine
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:15.320]  google wants to rank websites based on facts not links but then they will judge the facts
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:18.440]  like don't believe global warming's man made google's going to delist you
[02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:27.080]  the trustworthiness of a web page might help it rise up google's rankings if search giant starts to
[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:33.160]  measure quality by facts not just links and they've hired a research group connected to the usual
[02:10:33.160 --> 02:10:38.680]  suspects to decide this here's the info wars dot com story linking the new scientist google
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:44.360]  moving to shut down alternative media by ranking sites on facts rather than popularity and they list
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:51.800]  snopes as one such site i mean snopes literally is run by another moses on the mountain lady with a cat
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:56.760]  in fact pull up the people that run snopes i mean i mean nothing is living in an apartment having
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:11:01.000]  a cat but i mean she has a husband and a cat she has a husband and a cat i'm pretty sure both are
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:08.600]  neutered and and and and global warming is real uh obama cares a great deal uh two plus two equals
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:17.640]  five whatever i'm sick of it well according to snopes vaccines are safe and effective
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:24.040]  according to snopes you can uh piss up a rope excuse me i apologize for that it slipped out
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:33.560]  you can't do that by the way folks down a rope and they'll still that's hard
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:39.160]  gotta be done with skill i always wonder why would you need to do that do that with a rope
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:42.920]  i'm just so sick of these people can we pull up the snopes people for a moment show them
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:48.040]  for tv viewers you're ready a listener info wars.com forward slash show
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:53.320]  you know what i don't like i don't like having to choose a site when there is no site it's a
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:57.560]  bunch of military industrial complex groups that want to just keep stirring up perma on the middle
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:06.760]  east and i'll tell you she is a beautiful lady though there they are look they have the self
[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:15.960]  of satisfied affected smile of of of an entitled person but they do have the pink afghan woven
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:22.840]  with the obese cat now that what if we got an obese cat and i married a lady just like that
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:26.440]  and then i had this satisfied look on my face look
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:36.200]  then i would know everything then i could say two plus two equals five
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:44.760]  like like obama carrier you know ebonics whatever it's uh common core oh boy
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:49.480]  very frustrating
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:57.640]  snopes got snoped snopes is run by a man and a woman with no background investigation
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:01.640]  using google and then they pick and choose oh my gosh
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:11.800]  i don't know which one's the man which one's the woman i mean i'm not being mean
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:18.120]  hey buckley can you call her up see i'm gonna date with that lady
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:25.160]  the one on the left okay i'm being mean i apologize i should be attacking them on
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:28.840]  their baloney not on what they look like you can attack me on what i look like as well
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:38.280]  i kind of resemble like a human bulldog with my clothes off i even have the hair like black spots
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:44.840]  white spots i'm just joking all right i apologize let's get back to the serious issue of benjamin
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:50.120]  yet nyahu who's going to come over here and speak for congress and then that'll give obama a bunch
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:56.360]  of support with the left this is all just more infighting more theater more more more garbage
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:05.080]  meanwhile uh america's central banker yelling that the private fellow reserve is going to hold
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:11.800]  rates the same we talked about this last week when it's in the news now feds raid texas political
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:20.840]  meeting fingerprint photograph all attendees sees phones
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:29.880]  okay right now let's go back to your calls i apologize let's talk to frank in new york frank
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:35.800]  you're on the air on the subject of israel the speech what's behind this because it's becoming
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:39.320]  a discussion you can say what you want to say about israel i'm asking why is he coming to give
[02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:43.240]  this speech is he really about to hit iran what do you think's gonna happen about that i mean
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.600]  what's the whole point of this and and and is israel against al-qaeda now or for it because
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:52.520]  we know our government helped put him in there but now says they're bombing him is it a real
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:58.520]  alliance with iran we've got right now what do you think's going on frank i think that netanyahu
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:03.960]  needs to come to new york and speaking as a new yorker growing up as a christian as yourself
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:09.800]  you got to respect israel we're all judaeo christians in that regard and some people just
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:15.640]  don't understand that they just don't get it you look at israel just think of the the logic behind
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:22.760]  this they are a small country and they are surrounded by everybody that hates them so you look at bb
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:27.240]  he's going to come to new york he's going to he's going to go he's he's going to come to new york
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:31.320]  he's going to say what he's going to say in front of the un like he has in the past he's going to go
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:35.240]  and he's going to go up in front of congress and the kabuki theater you were talking about between
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:40.040]  the democrats and the republicans or the democrats have to hide you get Pelosi getting up there she
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:46.920]  doesn't want bb to speak why the democrats don't want to speak because obama isn't doing a damn thing
[02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:53.560]  and picking aside and standing up for israel he's not even calling the islamic terrorists islamic
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:58.280]  so when you look at what's fire do you want as an american is your blood red like the rest of us
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:04.360]  but yeah i don't get it so bb yes he has a right to get there he has a right to stand up and he has
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:09.480]  to say look this is what's going on with your permission or without your permission israel
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:15.160]  as a sovereign nation has to stand up for itself and if we've got a fire one off at iran so be it
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:19.080]  well i've already said israel's a sovereign nation and that's what ran paul and everybody
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:27.000]  has said if they want to attack iran that's their issue my question is why is benjamin yahoo doing
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.640]  this now is it political or do they really think iran's getting ready to use a nuke because
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:37.560]  that'll make iran look like victims if israel strikes iran i don't think that's how it's
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:41.480]  going to happen they're like you said there's going to be a flag there's going to be some
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:46.520]  something that's going to happen like you said iran has nukes if iran's had him for a long time
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:51.000]  and i'm a firm believer in that because nobody was scared or that of our guys being over there
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:56.200]  when we were in iraq with our full forces then i was thinking oh crap what would happen if excuse
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:17:00.920]  if i said that on the air what would happen if what would happen if iran decided to unload on
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:07.800]  our boys while we're in iraq so you were over in iraq in the military you're saying no no no no
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:12.440]  you're saying you were concerned if iran decided to well that was the word when the people over
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:17.720]  in iraq was that iran had nukes up on the border and i mean we know saudi arabia's got them now
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:23.720]  they're proliferating everywhere um but i mean look at the lesson of north korea nobody'll
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:28.280]  attack them now even though they really deserve it with all the provocations they do because they've
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:32.600]  got nukes i think that's the lesson iran's going with let me ask you this what do you
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:38.440]  think's going on behind the scenes because you've got israel trying to knock iran out by backing
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:42.840]  bad groups in syria i think that's very bad but all these other governments did it too
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:49.000]  so israel kind of went along with that uh saudi arabia is in the middle of it and then now i mean
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.040]  who's who you can't even tell what's going on there's a lot of confusion there and it's there
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:57.240]  there's and listen if you believe in the end times obviously you're going to say there's
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:01.000]  going to be a lot of confusion and people are going to wonder what to believe wars and rumors
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:07.000]  of wars i i exactly this is what i believe i believe that israel has some hard information
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.560]  and i think that he's coming here to say hey we stand with you you're supposed to stand with
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:16.120]  our best friend over there they're the smallest but they're our best friend over there if they've
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:22.520]  got to take their gloves off so be it although i've heard some say that you know netanyahu
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:27.320]  doesn't have the stones to to do that and that's why he has a lot of opposition right now but i
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:32.040]  think the timing is right i think the time well that's true netanyahu is getting opposition from
[02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:37.000]  groups that think he should have already hit iran there you go and and coming here is the right
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.400]  time and it's the right time because he needs to stand up and this is why i'm glad the republicans
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:46.360]  have stood with him and say hey we and eventually we're bringing you here to stand up and speak
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:51.240]  your mind because you have to because what's going to go on besides our idiot congress they
[02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:55.480]  can't get out of their own way the world is going to be going around sure sure what about this problem
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:19:00.760]  there's some bullying going on by total pro-israel groups uh on the internet if you don't agree with
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:04.680]  everything israel's doing that then backfires and gives support to the super anti-israel
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:11.880]  groups that run around bullying even worse uh and are just i mean i am just uh i think anti-israel
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:18.040]  sentiment is growing do you agree with that i've seen it a lot and i'm a new yorker so sure so
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:21.880]  what do you think's behind that i mean israel's not the center of the world why are people so obsessed
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:27.320]  with it i think it becomes just a political diversion i mean here's an example radical islamists
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:32.840]  have killed about 300 000 people in libya and syria in the last couple years no one talks about them
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:37.160]  but when israel kills like 20 people in a bombing raid it's like the end of the world
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:43.080]  all i'm saying is it becomes a distraction everybody knows what israel does no one else
[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:46.840]  is guilty of anything that's that's all i'm pointing out i appreciate your call

[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:41.320]  monday through friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central we're here live i'm your host alex jones
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:45.320]  mike and illinois you're on the air go ahead
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:54.440]  and alex how are you good brother um okay so syria i ran saudi arabia and israel and isis
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:59.480]  are all connected part of the reason why they've been doing a slow burn in syria is because syria
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:05.480]  has a strategic alliance with iran and israel cannot strike iran until syria is neutralized i
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:09.960]  know so they backed al qaeda along with the west to take out the country which is incredibly immoral
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:15.560]  and wrong so when they sit back and they say obama's done nothing to support israel that's
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:21.400]  not true this whole grinding with isis and syria has been to wear syria down so that it's ability
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:27.640]  to respond when israel attacks iran is negated that's been the whole point no i totally agree and
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:32.200]  i like how you pulled it down simply when i babbled about it for an hour the question is what's the
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:39.080]  background now what's your take on the real power alliances now is there a real double cross of iran
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:45.480]  is is obama gonna double cross iran or is israel mad or bb mad that obama has double cross them
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:51.640]  and is in an alliance with iran i think israel's been terrified of the concept of iran getting
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:56.440]  the nuclear weapons since they started suggesting they were trying to do it and that's why all of
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:01.720]  this stuff that we've watched kickoff with syria has happened this has just been a long slow process
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:06.600]  because we couldn't directly go in and start bombing syria so we had to do it through a proxy
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:11.640]  third party so it's been a long so now israel has to act like the u.s isn't involved to give us cover
[02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:15.880]  when israel does it correct and i'd like you to pose that to pochemic because i'd like to see
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:20.280]  what is responsive to that as well well i wanted to wargame all this out and i think what you just
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:29.160]  said crystallized everything do what i can what else do you have to say about this mic um i it's
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:36.360]  a mess that's about all i can say about it i i see a lot of um hubbub going on about you know i i
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:41.400]  looked at like isis going after christians all of a sudden i mean these guys have never been
[02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:45.480]  they may not like christians but they've never been diehard we're going to go get
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:49.640]  roam i mean where did that come from and i think that was really to spur people on here to get
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:54.440]  people in the united states and then the west and sensed that oh we have to go get them they've
[02:26:54.440 --> 02:27:00.360]  left israel alone syria borders israel they share a border with israel you haven't heard anything
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:05.880]  about isis attacking israel well it's clear that the leadership of isis is completely run by the west
[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:09.000]  as best you can tell who do you think's quarterbacking the isis boys
[02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:16.360]  no idea to be honest with it's too mucky for me to call that one well we know i mean it's we know
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:27.480]  it's it's a fact it's it's uh it's the turks nato the saudi arabians with the money and israel
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:36.840]  is is helping with their arab agents as well the question is how can israel trust al qaeda to do
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:44.840]  things like this if i don't i don't know whether they intend on doing that i think they're just
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:50.040]  using them damascus is in between them and isis anyway so they can be fairly confident that
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:55.480]  syria will act as its own buffer to prevent isis from storming in yes um i know some people that
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:02.600]  have been uh over to turkey recently um first and uh well i don't want to get into why but uh the
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:07.000]  turks are scared of these guys i i don't know totally you know i don't know how much of that
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:12.200]  is just a front but uh from the people that he was meeting with and they're high-level people
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:16.840]  um they're terrified of isis they're really scared of these guys so you know they're
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:21.400]  they're maybe contributing factors they may be helping in some way shape or form you know logistically
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:26.760]  or otherwise but there's there's some well they're terrified because turkey you know exports wine
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:31.960]  and and they're not i mean they're like islam light and and of course they are are worried about
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:36.280]  them because they're afraid there could be an islamic uprising that takes over uh turkey as well
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:40.920]  so there is some evidence that's why saudi arabia is giving them money and exporting them
[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:45.880]  they're like here you go have your country with our enemy iraq and syria you go take them over
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:50.200]  don't take us over but but that's like paying off a pirate that that's only gonna bite them in the
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:55.400]  butt later i i do have one thing and i don't want to say it on air because i'm in the middle of some
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:00.680]  sensitive stuff myself um but i do have one thing that i would like to impart to you about the whole
[02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:05.800]  turkey syria thing um that i think is really important and well do this i can't talk to you

[02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:20.120]  lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way in defense of human liberty alex jones
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:33.480]  and i hope that judging member back in june of 2014 ran paul said iraq is a jihadist wonderland
[02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:38.840]  if we were to get rid of syrian president basher Assad it would be a jihadist wonderland in syria
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:45.560]  he said it's now a jihadist wonderland in iraq presently because we got over involved not because
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:52.760]  we had too little involvement well there's ran paul absolutely spot on and uh joel scowles on
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:58.040]  the world affairs brief dot com was kind of just to pop in with a quick news update i don't know his
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:06.360]  particular view yet on benjamin yetton yahoo's visit or on what he thinks is really going on
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:12.600]  with the real power alliances are things breaking down for the west with their backing of al-qaeda
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:18.520]  groups to take over syria blowback or is it part of a larger plan and is netton yahoo clearing the
[02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:25.640]  way for a joint strike with shawty arabia and then to give the west plausible deniability
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:32.200]  so that obama and the united states cannot have its interest hit uh by iranian retaliation and
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:39.480]  would iran buy that so is the triple cross about to happen first we work with al-qaeda against uh
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:44.760]  multiple middle eastern countries renaming isis double cross them side with iran and then triple
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:50.120]  cross iran what does joel scowles him with all of his contacts and world research think is happening
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:56.200]  we'll find out now joel hi alex good to be with you let me give you some background here going
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:35:03.480]  back to 2004 there was an uninvited insider to a top city of london meeting of globalists
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:08.280]  they didn't realize he wasn't a globalist he was one of the financial experts in the city of london
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:14.760]  he sat in on a meeting in 2010 and he heard them discuss their displeasure that israel that had
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:23.320]  been assigned to attack iran since 2004 had not done so and one of my sources in Israel says the
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:29.320]  reason they haven't done so is they feared syrian retaliation and so they basically put pressure on
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:35.320]  the united states to say you've got to get rid of syria before we'll attack iran and so that's
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:42.920]  what put the u.s. on the road to arming and funding yehadas through saudi arabia katar and bahrain
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:47.640]  um so they could have plausible deniability that's what been god's it was all about is
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:53.240]  shipping arms to the syrian yehadas in order over to a start and then as you know we've talked
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:36:01.800]  about before that program of the ousting aside got derailed by carrie indiscreetly saying or giving
[02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:07.240]  syrian out at a london press conference year and a half ago where he said yeah we wouldn't
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:14.600]  attack if they gave up the chemical weapons and they they did so and so it's set back to us a program
[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:21.480]  that's why they had to create isis to have an excuse to go back into iraq i mean go back into
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:28.520]  iraq and syria in order to take down a start that doesn't happen yet but what you hypothesized i think
[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:35.560]  is right on alex that is there's a triple cross going on but it's really kind of a triple deception
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:45.000]  going on israel has leaked to iraq sheva iraq sheva which is israel news network normally a very
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:52.760]  reliable right wing network news network private news network in israel that obama was going to
[02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:59.240]  threaten to shoot down israeli airplanes if they attacked ran that was completely bogus completely
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:06.040]  disinformation now that's insane i mean he would that that would be political suicide it would not
[02:37:06.040 --> 02:37:11.080]  only that i mean you'd have a tough time with american pilots shooting shooting down his rainy
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:16.520]  pilots who are the best in the world in terms of their you know top flight abilities they fly the
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:21.800]  same airplanes that we do they have the same type of i f f or identification friend and so you'd
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:27.560]  have a real but it was total bogus disinformation the reason it was put out is as you say to give
[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:33.400]  possible deniability to the united states that normally were we not involved with israel we even
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:37.960]  threatened to shoot down israeli airplanes if they did so and by the way you're a former marine
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:40.840]  corps fighter pilot so you know what you're talking about just for folks that don't know
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:47.800]  that's right i know what the israeli tactics are the best in the world but the point is the
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:52.360]  u.s would never threaten to shoot down the great aircraft because of the israeli lobby here in
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:58.440]  the united states but that was disinformation but what it shows is that israeli is getting
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:04.680]  closer to attacking iran you know probably with saudi arabia i know there have parents already
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:11.960]  to go through saudi arabian airspace to do that attack but the israeli seems to be really setting
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:17.240]  itself up for deniability that we don't have anything to do now i don't think that iran will
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:23.400]  buy this i don't think that it will spare us retaliation against us forces and i don't think
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:30.440]  the u.s wants to be spared i think they want to be retaliated against iran then they can join with
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:38.920]  israel to finish off the military of iran remember the purpose there is not to occupy iran that would
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:44.680]  be very unpopular in the u.s the purpose is to take down iran militarily because they're the only
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:52.040]  muslim nation that is on the verge of becoming self-sufficient in arms rockets aircraft weapons
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:57.480]  artillery drones no other arab country so they only want to cover with the american people
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:03.240]  so that obama doesn't look a warmonger so this is all complete theater that's right absolutely alex
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:08.840]  well that put nice bookends on it you know what's scary i can't disagree with anything you just said
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:14.760]  and that's basically what i've been saying and again i'm not a fan of these of these radical
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:20.520]  countries either but at the same time just the deceptiveness of all this the manipulation of
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:26.520]  all of this and then the most unsavory groups being funded and run around and commit all these
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:31.480]  atrocities we know a lot of it's for television but i mean they are going through and really
[02:39:31.480 --> 02:39:35.880]  doing some terrible things what is the end game in all of this joe scowles and where do you think
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:42.120]  it's going well the end game is to take down iran as i say they want to make sure that iran
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:48.440]  is is completely neutered in terms of its ability to produce weapons and arm the rest
[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:54.440]  of the arab world they've got israel are under the thumb side arabia under the thumb turkeys
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:40:00.280]  under the thumb and syria when it goes down hopefully they'll be able to control that with
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:07.000]  uh controlled you know the hottest now which probably are israeli agents israeli arab
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:12.440]  agents that have been trained to go in and do that i think even the speech of netanyahu was
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:18.120]  part of this political theater attempting to and all kinds of leaks came out about the obama
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:22.760]  administration was not in favor of his coming in the congress invited him despite the white
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:29.240]  house displeasure this is all political theater there's no way that the white house was really
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:36.840]  protesting netanyahu's visit but the end game is a major middle east war will not accelerate to
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:42.120]  world war three but i think it will create absolute hatred against israel and the united
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:47.560]  states among the arab world which is part of the rationale for eventually attacking the west
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:53.880]  creating hatred among the world both in the syrian world and in the muslim world against the united
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:41:00.440]  states so that when russia and china finally attack the west that they will feel justified so it's
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:04.840]  another suckering like world war two is suckering in the japanese if you pull back from this
[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:10.760]  i'm just sick of everyone being obsessed over israel and acting like they actually are the
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:15.800]  dominant factor when you can see more and more that the forces running the united states in europe
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:20.760]  are giving the orders to turkey are giving the orders to israel are giving the orders to a certain
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:24.520]  extent to saudi arabia though that's really incestuous we'll have to have you back soon to do a

[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:40.840]  nyahu uh speaking at apac this morning set to address congress tomorrow is this political theater
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:46.360]  or is this a split with the united states angle american establishment beginning to break away
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:53.480]  from israel steve pacinic well this is really once again uh bb stupid arrogant self-destructive
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:43:00.680]  ways he started this when i was involved with james baker under the bush senior administration
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:07.240]  where baker correctly threw him out of the office for calling him insolent stupid and arrogant uh
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:13.640]  this and uh subsequently clinton senior also did the same thing what you see here between bb
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:20.840]  and his right hand man a mr ron derma who's from miami beach is you basically see two americans
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:26.680]  you do not see israelis let's get that very clear these are not israelis these are people who grew
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:33.800]  up in the united states went to mit where he went in mit when i was there in the 70s got a business
[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:39.960]  degree bb never fought in the united states army then went over to israel as a dual citizenship
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:46.200]  was indicted for corruption shamir didn't like him mechana manachem beggin didn't like him nobody
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:52.360]  liked him he was arrogant not very bright and strategically very inept at the same time he
[02:43:52.360 --> 02:43:57.640]  picked the right hand man who was even stupider than he ron derma from an area where i come from
[02:43:57.640 --> 02:44:04.200]  miami beach where his family the rozenfels are the most corrupt mayors in a very corrupt city
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:10.040]  who has no idea what he's talking about in judyism no idea about israel this is nothing to do with
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:16.360]  israel this has to do with two arrogant american jews who've never really been part of israel
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:21.160]  have never fought in the united states have never deserved an american passport and what they're
[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:29.080]  trying to do is really try to justify bb's incipient notion that we should not have an agreement
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:36.200]  with iran which is incorrect number one iran has been our partner for the past eight to nine years
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:42.360]  has helped our military and our intelligence get out of iraq afghanistan and is now the most
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:49.480]  effective partner against isis and al-qaeda who are the members who are fighting alongside isis
[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:57.240]  they are bb netanyahu Saudi arabia and katar bb is very much a part of the isis group that is
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:04.200]  ostensibly beheading everybody bb has formed in a formal alliance with Saudi Arabia so what this is
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:11.320]  is an indictment of bb not israel not zion so are you saying a right-wing breakaway group is in a
[02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:18.520]  proxy war uh basically with the united states over interest in the middle east we're allied it's not
[02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:25.240]  even that alex you're giving him too much legitimacy this is a stupid arrogant blowhard
[02:45:25.240 --> 02:45:31.480]  who was elected to prime minister he doesn't have the popularity vote among the intellectuals or even
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:37.240]  the military or intelligence in israel and basically is trying to blow his own horn when
[02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:42.360]  he was thrown out by our own secretary of the state and our president of the united states
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:49.240]  clinton as well as obama and he's trying to exert some kind of leverage so that he can get
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:53.960]  reelected has nothing to do with israel well i mean to back up some of what you're saying
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:59.480]  mayer degan london guardian former sodhead urges israel voters to al spengeman netanyahu
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:03.800]  and basically says quote destructor the future security of israel he goes on to say that he's
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:09.000]  dangerous he's very dangerous actually what i've always said is what happened to ruby and should
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:16.120]  happen to bb he understands that in okay not on this come on i'm not well i'm saying that i you're
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:22.600]  not saying that i'm saying that but if israel wants to survive which it does it cannot it cannot
[02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:29.640]  bring in american low-level self-aggrandizing jews who know nothing about diaspora have never
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:35.080]  served our country have never really served israel have never been in our military have been nurtured
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:40.280]  by us this guy dermin went to the university of pennsylvania and to think he was smart he went to
[02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:46.600]  oxford where anybody can get a degree you just sit there and read and he's a dumb miami jew
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:52.040]  as well as his family and his wife who's from baltimore see you're not talking about israelis
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:57.320]  you're not talking about sabras you're not talking about her dog whose father was in the british army
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:02.360]  of the israeli army and was head of our ambassadorship you're not talking about sipi liddy
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:08.280]  whose father was headed the agun say lumina monaco begat these are two outcasts from the israeli
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:14.040]  zionist narrative they don't belong there they don't belong in america and they should be thrown out
[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:20.440]  it has nothing to do with israeli military or israeli intelligence they're still a strong part
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:26.600]  of our own military and our own intelligence we will make a deal with iran i guarantee you that
[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:34.120]  it will be to our benefit syria will be staying alive and russia will help us that is the geopolitical
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:38.280]  reality that i said years ago sure you just said that years ago here and what was the whole point
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:43.320]  then of trying to overthrow syria to begin with did the west fail in that project yes it was a very
[02:47:43.320 --> 02:47:50.120]  big mistake made by generals abizade the neocons again the same people will for what steve hadley
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:56.040]  all the ones who are part of jeb bush's new and different uh a coterie of friends jeb bush just
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:48:02.200]  announced he's a different man but he just took on board every one of the old bush okay the neocons
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:06.520]  are such failures why are they always in power then of their justice there's nothing to stop them
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:11.960]  other than what we would normally do because they basically come back in they have the wall
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:18.040]  wall street journal they they cower to people who are incompetent like jeb bush they go back into
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:25.320]  the bush family jeb is a moral hazard he's had a history of ineffective work here in miami and in
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:31.080]  florida he used to like jeb more than huh i used to like him but i said if you stay quiet and you
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:37.000]  keep quiet and you don't go any further than your capabilities then stay shut america needs a leader
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:42.920]  it doesn't need a sycophant whose brothers had destroyed the country including melvin neal who
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:49.720]  gave us the savings and loan crisis and bush jr who gave us the 2008 financial crisis so when you
[02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:55.080]  go out and you say i'm a i'm my own man and you don't have anything to offer and you are not a very
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:49:00.520]  good governor that's an insult to the american people it's an insult to jews to call it am i right
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:04.840]  though that this is dangerous if we do hit iran because russia can get involved or is it not
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:10.360]  dangerous no it's not dangerous russia's interest is basically to make sure that they have a
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:17.000]  perimeter where i ran works with russia syria works with russia and the al qaeda units and ices
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:22.680]  are basically neutralized and that's what we're working on right now we want halibut and we want
[02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:28.600]  schlumberger and all those companies to go back into iran to to beef up the capabilities in the
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:34.360]  middle east and to and to break up the secret what does saudi arabia want saudi arabia is in

[02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:18.600]  the FCC won't release the 300 plus pages won't test five before congress we had the former chief
[02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:25.080]  counsel bruce fine on from the FCC saying it's just that an FCC power grab uh south by southwest
[02:54:25.080 --> 02:54:31.080]  schedule coming up march 17th they're gonna have the FCC subhead they're propagandizing about how
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:34.680]  great and open this is but they won't release the documents so that's what it's all about it's why
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:39.800]  they won't release it is so they can run around and lie about it all day dr. steve pacinic finishing
[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:46.680]  up with uh the statements about preparing for war with russia um what's the latest on ukraine
[02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:51.240]  where do you think that's going well i don't think it's a war with russia basically the ukraine
[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:59.240]  has uh the this administration has been effective in running an economic war and basically reducing
[02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:06.680]  the price of oil and at the same time reducing the ruble by 50 to 60 percent and making uh the
[02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:13.720]  russian bond a junk bond so prudent has a real problem both of inflation economic chaos and
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:20.040]  impending political chaos it's more of an internal issue he cannot fund a war he's not capable of
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:25.400]  funding a war the russians don't want to fight a war they need to reconstruct their own internal
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:30.840]  capacity to grow internally the russians are great people they understand that this cannot
[02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:36.440]  continue they want to live a good life and putin is not able to really control it contrary to what
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:40.760]  a lot of people say putin is not as smart as everybody what do you think about the latest
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:46.120]  assassination the opposition leader well i think it was an old kgb technique i mean i've said it
[02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:51.480]  10 12 years ago when i wrote in the intelligence journal that putin was always going to be kgb
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:56.280]  forever and this is an old awkward technique you don't think it's a false flag to create a martyr
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:03.480]  no no because putin has done this way before with the chechens putin is not that clever to create
[02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:09.160]  a martyr and reverse it because those days are gone false flag has become now the natural narrative
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:16.520]  to this and the cia doesn't have a real uh uh you know uh credible narrative for this right now the
[02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:22.600]  cia is too busy along with our military intelligence running all kinds of other operations in terms of
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:30.280]  economic warfare psychological warfare which is far more effective assassinating a uh an opposition
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:37.080]  leader is very systematic and it's a very old system of operation for the kgb whether putin
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:42.440]  directly did it or he claims the chechens who did it or because the man was jewish it's all
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:48.040]  nonsense the point of fact is he was assassinated the point of fact that's putin is in trouble
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:54.200]  and the people need some liberty it's as simple as that in terms of bb and his representatives
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:59.160]  they don't represent israel they don't represent anybody but theirself doc thank you steven shank

[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:33.480]  there's real fast finish exactly what you're getting at what i'm getting at folks is that they've
[03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:41.160]  been moving israel into the middle east this whole time isis is mozad mi6 mercenaries from all
[03:00:41.160 --> 03:00:46.200]  different countries i don't believe the christians that they're showing being a lot of the stuff alex
[03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:54.200]  is false flag disinformation to keep us in fear uh it's rhetoric look key players were paid 20
[03:00:54.200 --> 03:01:01.080]  million dollars a piece okay to run this garbage for the last point a minute wait you don't believe
[03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:07.240]  that isis has armies of seven foot men you think they might be fake i think they're actually 11
[03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:13.160]  feet tall to tell you the truth i hear you i hear you i hear you there's a real armies they have
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:18.200]  invading and taking over but they are engaged in a lot of pr stuff you can see it's just cartoonish
[03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:25.560]  it's so crazy scott in texas you're on the air go ahead uh yeah alex wanted to run something past
[03:01:25.560 --> 03:01:31.080]  you and get you get your take especially since joel was on and trailed off his comments with
[03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:34.440]  whenever the russians and chinese attack as though it's a foregone conclusion
[03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:41.880]  if they attack iran are they going are the iranians going to set off bombs in this country and would
[03:01:41.880 --> 03:01:48.520]  that trigger anything international on our soil i think there's a good chance the iranians would
[03:01:48.520 --> 03:01:53.640]  or our government would do it and blame it on them so you think it could happen
[03:01:53.640 --> 03:01:58.840]  man the government is running around acting really weird and they're digging in they're
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:03.080]  acting really strange elites are moving to the middle of nowhere everywhere they're planning
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:06.280]  on something big i don't know if it's an economic collapse or a big war i don't know what do you
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:17.880]  think uh i would tend toward economics but when these politicians go crazy anything can happen
[03:02:17.880 --> 03:02:22.520]  well that's right and throughout history they usually end up going crazy and so that's the
[03:02:22.520 --> 03:02:29.240]  problem we're overdue for that we're insane this is utter insanity what's going on yeah
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:35.720]  deciding what i ran uh then backing al-qaeda but then bombing them and then renaming them and then
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:41.720]  i mean i i'll be frank i can't even figure out what's going on at this point i appreciate your
[03:02:41.720 --> 03:02:46.440]  call which is the globalist plan and then they just use the crises to get more power see they
[03:02:46.440 --> 03:02:50.760]  don't care if there's chaos because they always come out on top so it makes no sense to us because
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:56.440]  it doesn't make sense just like people can't figure out what jeffrey dommer did what he did
[03:02:56.440 --> 03:03:02.040]  because you're not jeffrey dommer you you're not gonna figure out crazy but these people are crazy
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:11.640]  like a fox damien and pencil vanya go ahead mind your i can walk i'm calling in about the caller
[03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:18.600]  earlier he was uh talking about nuke and i ran asap of course it would be easy to to survive and to
[03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:23.800]  create such a machine all you would need is a giant complex of computers connected to a group of
[03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:30.920]  belly bombs but why didn't you tell the world it was to be announced at the next party conference
[03:03:31.720 --> 03:03:39.400]  mind fear we must not allow a mineshaft gap sorry sorry you i could take that 10 to one female
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:44.360]  ratio there that'd be all right of course the females would be have to be chosen for the
[03:03:44.360 --> 03:03:51.000]  stimulating qualities for the duties of each male and the 10 females i have so much of a
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:58.120]  great idea there her doctor sorry go ahead and it's just a guy earlier who was talking about
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:04:03.800]  for scowls and he was talking about we need a nuke i ran asap i just i can't believe people
[03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:08.120]  actually think like that what does he what does he think that's going to lead to why i mean why
[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:14.200]  why do people like that think that that's actually an option it just blows me away well scout
