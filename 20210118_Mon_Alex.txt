[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  This year's Davos is very, very different from all the previous.
[00:29.960 --> 00:36.960]  The World Economic Forum, along with the United Nations, along with the International Monetary Fund,
[00:36.960 --> 00:43.960]  and along with any number of prominent globalist organisations and powerful individuals, including Prince Charles,
[00:43.960 --> 00:55.960]  together have jointly promised that the 2021 World Economic Forum will be used to introduce via a vast network of connected big-tech corporations,
[00:55.960 --> 01:03.960]  online activist movements and compliant local and national governments, something they call the Great Reset.
[01:03.960 --> 01:14.960]  It is a global commitment they have made to use the panic and fear generated by the coronavirus as a means to reshape all our economies and laws
[01:14.960 --> 01:20.960]  and move to a new form of capitalism that focuses on net-zero emissions.
[01:20.960 --> 01:28.960]  And this is real evil we're facing. And so folks need to understand that it's coming in to shut everything down.
[01:28.960 --> 01:34.960]  There's a global revolution against the New World Order. Globalism is a consortium of corporations that do not want free market.
[01:34.960 --> 01:37.960]  They want fascist monopoly to carry out eugenics.
[01:37.960 --> 01:42.960]  The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[01:42.960 --> 01:51.960]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[01:51.960 --> 02:00.960]  Australia's vaccine regulator says it's investigating reports of deaths among elderly patients in Norway who have received the Pfizer jab.
[02:00.960 --> 02:05.960]  I call them globalists because they call themselves globalists starting in the 70s of Bigden-Brasinski.
[02:05.960 --> 02:13.960]  Globalist believes in global government, not international man and libertarianism, and you can travel and live wherever you want and their standardized systems.
[02:13.960 --> 02:18.960]  I'm all for that as long as it's free market. As long as people agree to it, it's not authoritarian.
[02:18.960 --> 02:24.960]  But the great reset in saying you're not essential in shutting down small businesses and coming with forced inoculations.
[02:24.960 --> 02:29.960]  And all of this is authoritarian globalism, technocracy in their own words.
[02:29.960 --> 02:36.960]  One of the features of this forced industrial revolution is that it doesn't change what we are doing, but it changes us.
[02:36.960 --> 02:43.960]  This is criminal what's happening. And this is all the great reset. This is all the UN World Government takeover. This is 21st century war.
[02:43.960 --> 02:49.960]  And these are the guys that say we can't have national borders and that we've got to take migrants, quote, into our homes.
[02:49.960 --> 02:54.960]  Outnumbered and facing thousands of people determined to enter Guatemala.
[02:54.960 --> 03:06.960]  It doesn't take long for these Hondurans to push through the lines of soldiers at Guatemala's eastern Amor border and press on their aim to reach the United States.
[03:06.960 --> 03:13.960]  Many were held up after not presenting ideas or asked for proof of a negative coronavirus test before entering.
[03:13.960 --> 03:19.960]  But many ignored the formal crossing, instead illegally breaching the border nearby.
[03:19.960 --> 03:24.960]  We've all got to have COVID passports to travel even inside the country and not even start your car.
[03:24.960 --> 03:27.960]  That's where all this is going. It's all being announced. It's insane.
[03:27.960 --> 03:35.960]  Wow. We have Jack Dorsey caught secretly by Project Veritas communicating what he believed the top executives at Twitter.
[03:35.960 --> 03:49.960]  We, you know, we are focused on one account right now, but this is going to be much bigger than just one account. And it's going to go on for much longer than just this week, the next few weeks to hang on beyond the inauguration.
[03:49.960 --> 03:52.960]  We have to expect that we have to be ready for that.
[03:52.960 --> 04:06.960]  So the focus is certainly on this account and how it ties to real-world violence, but also we need to think much longer term around how these dynamics play out over time.
[04:06.960 --> 04:10.960]  I don't believe this is going away at any time soon.
[04:10.960 --> 04:13.960]  We've got the Mexican president coming out saying he's going to lead a global movement.
[04:13.960 --> 04:20.960]  Trump should have done this to stop big tech from abusing the people and censoring everyone and that this is a criminal combine.
[04:20.960 --> 04:24.960]  It's one of the greatest dangers the world's ever seen. That's what Ted Cruz says, too.
[04:24.960 --> 04:37.960]  I'm just thinking, God, every day that I'm not them and not involved in the incredible evil they're involved in because these are enslaved, demonically controlled people.
[04:37.960 --> 04:40.960]  My friends, thank you so much for joining us.
[04:40.960 --> 04:43.960]  That's the most important video we put out in a long time. That's why I've aired it last night.
[04:43.960 --> 04:50.960]  And today, it's titled The Great Reset Button. It has been pushed. It's at man.video. You might want to share it.
[04:50.960 --> 04:56.960]  I'm Alex Jones and we're 48 hours exactly out from the Communist Chinese dictator being installed.
[04:56.960 --> 04:58.960]  Official martial law will then follow.
[05:02.960 --> 05:05.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts.
[05:05.960 --> 05:07.960]  I have looked at every facet of this.
[05:07.960 --> 05:13.960]  And now, the only days until the inauguration of the Chai Kong agent, it's all coming into place.
[05:13.960 --> 05:18.960]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud. It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[05:18.960 --> 05:24.960]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[05:24.960 --> 05:34.960]  And now, use the already martial law in place for COVID-19, and that's what it is, to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[05:34.960 --> 05:41.960]  They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked. They train and do what you're told for 9, 10 months as training wheels, and now they launch the storm.
[05:41.960 --> 05:49.960]  The storm is here. It's a globalist storm. There's not going to be martial law for Trump. There's going to be martial law for the globalist.
[05:49.960 --> 05:56.960]  They're trying to set you up. Don't be involved in violence. Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[05:56.960 --> 06:06.960]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[06:27.960 --> 06:39.960]  Yes, my friends, you can certainly enjoy the silence of the record number of Christians killed last year worldwide, up 60% from the previous year.
[06:39.960 --> 06:48.960]  And in the last decade, there's been a doubling total in the killing of Christians. And so now you notice it's becoming logarithmic, exponential.
[06:48.960 --> 06:58.960]  So you'll have more Christians dying in the next couple of years than died in the previous 10. That's just a little example of what's really happening.
[06:58.960 --> 07:06.960]  The millions of dead, real people, but you're not going to hear them personalized. You're not going to see their faces.
[07:06.960 --> 07:15.960]  You're not going to be told why they're being exterminated with extreme pleasure or why the UN targets Christians everywhere in Canada, the world, killing millions of them in Africa alone.
[07:15.960 --> 07:22.960]  Because after all, I mean, CNN fights Nazis, right?
[07:22.960 --> 07:31.960]  Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Yooker, they're nice guys. They're going to take good care of you and your family.
[07:31.960 --> 07:48.960]  You can enjoy the silence as carlers have been shut down. Now, they want telegraph shut down. They want everything shut down. They say because 25 million people that were kicked off of Twitter in the last few weeks have gone to this other website in just the last 24 hours.
[07:48.960 --> 07:58.960]  So we can't allow that. And they're all going to band.video. They're going to infowars.com. And we can't let the evil white supremacist exist.
[07:58.960 --> 08:06.960]  And once you have agreed not letting white supremacist exist, it basically aren't many of. Well, then nobody else has any rights either. See how that works?
[08:06.960 --> 08:17.960]  Parlers fired back up on much smaller servers is having a lot of problems. But this is the crippling process we've had to go through just to keep infowars on air as well the last few years.
[08:17.960 --> 08:26.960]  So we've already been through it. It's ongoing every day. And it is you and your word of mouth, but your financial support that keeps us in the position.
[08:26.960 --> 08:42.960]  Millions and millions and millions of dollars extra spent just because of the censorship just because of what we've had to build and infrastructure wise and just all sorts of let's just say this arduous passages that others don't have to take.
[08:42.960 --> 08:46.960]  But it has made us a little bit stronger like the mountain goat.
[08:46.960 --> 09:05.960]  All right, let me tell you what's going on today. Most epic ever each day just gets more insane as we accelerate into the quickening into the singularity of evil has as the world opens up and becomes a public abode of demons or really nasty entities that don't like
[09:05.960 --> 09:17.960]  Christianity very much like the Bible told us like the Peshma. I just played a clip of they say John the Revelator. He's a smooth operator and they say he's a scammer and he stole his religion from the Muslims.
[09:17.960 --> 09:22.960]  Even though Muslims didn't exist for 400 years after Christianity.
[09:22.960 --> 09:25.960]  But why are they attacking John the Revelator?
[09:25.960 --> 09:31.960]  Because he told you everything was going to happen 2000 years ago. I mean, I just told you 2526 years ago before it happened.
[09:31.960 --> 09:36.960]  John the Revelator told you a couple thousand years before. Oh and Daniel.
[09:36.960 --> 09:42.960]  What was that 3000 years ago? I mean, I could just keep going back for you if you'd like me to but.
[09:42.960 --> 09:54.960]  It's here exactly what they warned of specifically and your churches aren't going to tell you they're going to have QR codes to check into the church and they're going to tell you take your vaccines and here's some of the news on that front.
[09:54.960 --> 10:05.960]  French workers angrily reject social distancing collars that track and trace and control you they're already putting them in as wristbands in.
[10:05.960 --> 10:12.960]  Singapore and communist China and other areas but there's something about being around the neck that people really get their slave.
[10:12.960 --> 10:17.960]  So that's all coming up and then I found a Homeland Security report we first reported on.
[10:17.960 --> 10:25.960]  12 years ago how they were looking at making you wear shock bracelets and necklaces then everyone to get on a plane.
[10:25.960 --> 10:27.960]  They said yeah we want to make everybody wear a shock necklace.
[10:27.960 --> 10:30.960]  The folks said that won't fly.
[10:30.960 --> 10:33.960]  But see if you call it a COVID necklace.
[10:33.960 --> 10:38.960]  Well then of course you must and you're not allowed to criticize anything COVID related from the UN.
[10:38.960 --> 10:40.960]  It's our boss.
[10:40.960 --> 10:48.960]  And just like that we're inside the new world order so that's a big stack that's just one of the articles I've got.
[10:48.960 --> 10:58.960]  From infoworks.com and I've got the local newscast in France how wonderful it is and how well don't worry adults are having problems with it but children are going to be made to all wear it in France.
[10:58.960 --> 11:09.960]  And CNN said in two articles last year that it'll be just like wearing a seatbelt everyone will permanently wear a mask and you will permanently take whatever vaccines they say whenever they say.
[11:09.960 --> 11:15.960]  And you will permanently six feet distance because you'll put up with it.
[11:15.960 --> 11:21.960]  And now folks are getting the COVID vaccine and they're still being told oh still got to wear a mask still got to take COVID tests.
[11:21.960 --> 11:22.960]  It never ends.
[11:22.960 --> 11:25.960]  There's no way out except saying no.
[11:25.960 --> 11:38.960]  And finally that's starting to happen in Italy and other areas where tens of thousands of restaurants are declaring themselves as a union in solidarity and saying we are all going to say no you can't enforce against all of us.
[11:38.960 --> 11:49.960]  But once they have you all in a digital currency and digital banking system they will be able to just like New Jersey where they tried to bankrupt that big successful gym.
[11:49.960 --> 12:01.960]  And they were starting to win in court so the state just sees $150,000 every dime the company had to pay payroll and to pay for the bill on the building and to pay for the insurance.
[12:01.960 --> 12:07.960]  They barely had enough money to stay open and now they're going to have to close but they're starting to get cash donations.
[12:07.960 --> 12:17.960]  And all they got to do is call themselves a church or BLM then they'll be protected under the First Amendment and all of us should say we're part of the church of freedom.
[12:17.960 --> 12:20.960]  In fact I really think I'm going to incorporate a church.
[12:20.960 --> 12:24.960]  All I got to do is believe in freedom and a pro human future and you can be part of it.
[12:24.960 --> 12:35.960]  And it's what I believe because I need to get back to the real power of the Republic in the First Amendment because that's where it all is and hell I'm a preacher anyways as everybody knows.
[12:35.960 --> 12:37.960]  So yeah I tend to do that. I tend to move on very very quickly.
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.960]  Remember under Obama they wouldn't even let conservatives set up 501c3s or set up churches.
[12:42.960 --> 12:45.960]  Well under the First Amendment I don't need that.
[12:45.960 --> 12:49.960]  But again we have to get back to that folks. We have to come out of the system.
[12:49.960 --> 12:55.960]  We have to become self-sufficient. We have to stop being domesticated and when I'm telling you that I'm telling myself that.
[12:55.960 --> 13:05.960]  If you've got to work in the city you better get yourself a shack you stay in and then you get yourself a piece of property somewhere where you can grow and and and and
[13:05.960 --> 13:16.960]  and live a subsistence area and hopefully get some good neighbors because that's the only value there's going to be in the future because everything is a giant vice grip coming in to squeeze us around the neck.
[13:16.960 --> 13:25.960]  Now we've got so much news. We've got the giant UN funded caravans that are way more than 7000 smashing through Guatemala's defenses on their way here.
[13:25.960 --> 13:29.960]  The first salvo as soon as the UN knew they had Joe Biden in.
[13:29.960 --> 13:33.960]  Trump had cut off Guatemala's money until they stopped it.
[13:33.960 --> 13:41.960]  But now Biden's going to actually pay them to build refugee centers in Guatemala to move in not hundreds of thousands but millions.
[13:41.960 --> 13:49.960]  It is all being announced. Then the UN will control them. They will vote Democrat. They will be given universal income.
[13:49.960 --> 13:59.960]  They're building all these giant tiny coffin apartments for the third world that's coming here to be exploited and for your wages to be dropped.
[13:59.960 --> 14:01.960]  It's incredible.
[14:01.960 --> 14:12.960]  Most human futures here we told you once they had the COVID lockdowns that would implode the third world and in the local newscast and on the Sky TV newscast on the London Guardian BBC newscast they go oh yeah.
[14:12.960 --> 14:21.960]  COVID lockdowns totally collapsed the third world from Africa to Latin America to Asia and they're all coming here now.
[14:21.960 --> 14:31.960]  And they've also in the Caribbean said no tourism allowed now for 10 12 months. And so those people are all going to the mainland to get here as well because they just don't have a job.
[14:31.960 --> 14:33.960]  See how it works.
[14:33.960 --> 14:43.960]  But the average yuppie wears the little mask and feels all good and oh it's just for 15 days. Oh it's just for two months. It's just for a year. It's just for two years. It's just forever.
[14:43.960 --> 14:52.960]  Because it's a little diaper you wear of your face because you're good and out of the stress. You go on the Stockholm syndrome control.
[14:52.960 --> 15:06.960]  It's all coming up but first when we come back. We have the Bonafides we have the ironclad proof. They're not even hiding it because the official story submitted prompts gone and the martial law moves forward.
[15:06.960 --> 15:12.960]  We have the total absolute complete proof of it all.
[15:12.960 --> 15:27.960]  The deep state use the Boogaloo's and Antifa Boogaloo's posing as proud boys we now know exactly the names to break in that they're bragging about it to launch the attack then to exfiltrate to leave.
[15:27.960 --> 15:38.960]  The media focused in on the few events that happened that were bad made the whole crowd look bad and launched it so they can then wait for it blame the US military.
[15:38.960 --> 15:50.960]  I told you that when they start announcing the military was the enemy that's when you would know the Orwellian Purge plan and now it's official Fox News FBI believes the military is the main enemy.
[15:50.960 --> 15:57.960]  This is the Communist Chinese takeover. This is Hell on Earth.

[18:11.960 --> 18:28.960]  Why you bitchin' about John the Revelator? Me think you quote test too much. Me think you don't like the intel.
[18:28.960 --> 18:43.960]  John the Revelator, put him in a bed, take him up to the highest high. Take him up to the top where the mountains stop, let him tell his poor girl lies.
[18:43.960 --> 18:58.960]  John the Revelator, he's just smooth on the rails, time we cut him down to size. Take him by the hand, put him on the stand.
[18:58.960 --> 19:25.960]  What a half hours there are from the Communist Chinese dictator being sworn in as absolute ruler of the once great republic. You can definitely put on the tombstone the United States of America born July 4th, 1776, died of treason, died of infiltration, died of Satanism.
[19:25.960 --> 19:45.960]  January 21st, the year 2020. But here's the good news. People, unless they're Jesus Christ or Lazarus, are not resurrected from the dead.
[19:45.960 --> 20:01.960]  So many countries can be, though it is very rare. Okay, but just as Winston Churchill in the darkest hours of the Blitz against the Nazis said, I do not come to you with a bunch of lies and telling everything's gonna be fine.
[20:01.960 --> 20:16.960]  I do not come to you with sweat and pain and toil and death. But I tell you this, if we fight, if we're strong, we will come through this better than being slaves and what Hitler has planned for us. And it was true.
[20:16.960 --> 20:33.960]  I say, man, your show is dark. Well, what I say comes true. What the Q people tell you is trust the plan. And let me tell you, you watch in 47 and a half hours, they're gonna march that skeleton up on that scaffolding.
[20:33.960 --> 20:46.960]  Remember, I said, they said they won't be on that scaffolding. I said it 50 times. I said they're lying so no one's out there. So there's not a protest. They're gonna put a fence up around it. See the archivist can find that from like a month ago.
[20:46.960 --> 20:57.960]  And they're going to lock it down. He wants to stand up there and piss on America. He'll bring Hunter up there in front of everybody as well as the Chinese spy, the pedophile to rub it in.
[20:57.960 --> 21:06.960]  It's about rubbing it in and making you give up. And Trump said, have a big demonstration. We did. The Capitol Police stood down. It's not our fault.
[21:06.960 --> 21:15.960]  A handful of people, boogaloo's, posing as proud boys and well-meaning Q people that thought they were liberating the Capitol. They were peaceful.
[21:15.960 --> 21:28.960]  But the boogaloo's were violent. Along with the Antivore violent, they broke in. They got in. And the rest is history. They called it the as bad as Pearl Harbor, uninsurrection, all this ridiculous crap.
[21:28.960 --> 21:36.960]  But now it's confirmed it's Operation Trust 2.0. We'll tell you more about this segment and next.
[21:36.960 --> 21:49.960]  Everything the globalists do is a rerun of the Bolshevik Revolution because it worked in Russia, it worked in China, it worked in Vietnam, it worked in North Korea, it worked in Cuba, it worked in Venezuela.
[21:49.960 --> 21:55.960]  Would you like me to keep going on how it worked here, how it worked there?
[21:55.960 --> 22:18.960]  And it all came out of the sickening occultic left in New York City and London, England on record. The U.S. sent over 100,000 Russian immigrants to invade in 1917 with Joe Stalin and V.I. London.
[22:18.960 --> 22:28.960]  And then they butchered millions of Christians with exceptional deliciousness. They really like it. And the Lenin said, I'm here to kill Christians, that's why we took over. Hail Satan.
[22:28.960 --> 22:36.960]  More blood, more death. They're not atheists, they're devil worshipers. And they're out in the open about that now.
[22:36.960 --> 22:43.960]  So that's who we got a real infestation of, folks. This is what we did to Russia coming home to roost.
[22:43.960 --> 22:50.960]  They're just so pissed that Putin's halfway pulled away from these folks.
[22:50.960 --> 22:57.960]  By the way, the average Russian knows all this. Alexander Shultz and Eatzen told them all about it.
[22:57.960 --> 23:06.960]  So what did I tell you last week? I said they're next going to say the military can't be trusted, it must be vetted by the ADL and the Southern Primary Law Center.
[23:06.960 --> 23:19.960]  And sure as the sun came up this morning, Fox News, FBI vetting National Guard troops in D.C. amid fears of insider attack, using databases provided by the Southern Primary Law Center and the ADL to see if they're pro-Trump.
[23:19.960 --> 23:25.960]  And if they're pro-Trump or pro-America, they can't be trusted.
[23:25.960 --> 23:38.960]  This is the drumming out of the Patriots. And then of course they'll lead opposition under Operation Trust 2.0 of secret societies in the military that will call for an overthrow of Biden.
[23:38.960 --> 23:44.960]  And then they'll start purging the military and arresting the military because that's the real final target is taking over the military.
[23:44.960 --> 23:51.960]  They've already taken over everything else. The media, online, the churches, the universities, the banks, everything.
[23:51.960 --> 24:01.960]  The families, America is falling. Let's be honest that we're falling so we can wake up and take everything the enemy says and do the opposite.
[24:01.960 --> 24:08.960]  Don't shop with the globalists, don't support the globalists, have nothing to do with them, and withdraw completely and realize you are actually occupied.
[24:08.960 --> 24:17.960]  They don't want you to do that. They want you to sit here and see the military and see martial law because you're a bad American and it's there for you when they stage this false flag.
[24:17.960 --> 24:25.960]  And then the whole thing is really to then turn back in our own military because it's Operation Trust.
[24:25.960 --> 24:32.960]  And that's why Q, run by these folks, went in and told the military is in control. You must worship it. It's going to do the right thing.
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.960]  Don't worry. You can be passive. It was a pacification operation. That's what Julian Assange said.
[24:37.960 --> 24:44.960]  Oh, but you can't trust him, of course. You can trust a magical person though over there and trust the plan.
[24:44.960 --> 24:49.960]  So I'm done going on the Q thing because that's a lot of well-meaning people that we're covering.
[24:49.960 --> 24:54.960]  People are like, well, don't you believe Jeffrey Epstein was a pedophile? Yeah, it talks about it 15 years ago.
[24:54.960 --> 25:09.960]  All of this was real stuff, but just that Q was in control and everything was fine and trust the plan and then sprinkling in dates that came not true on purpose to discredit everything else we were doing and that you were doing.
[25:09.960 --> 25:15.960]  It was a way to lead the opposition.
[25:15.960 --> 25:22.960]  And now the Boogaloo Boys, I'm going to show you, are publicly allowed on Twitter, Facebook, everywhere saying they did the capital, they attacked, they did it all.
[25:22.960 --> 25:32.960]  And they were allowed to go in and allowed to leave because the police wanted to stand down so they could then set up.
[25:32.960 --> 25:42.960]  So they could then set up the few Q people. That was mainly who did it. You see all the shirts, all the photos. They're just all friendly. Hey, man, how's it going? Hey, whoa, hey, don't stop me violent.
[25:42.960 --> 25:46.960]  Hey, officer, appreciate it. Take a selfie.
[25:46.960 --> 25:54.960]  But the Antifa and Boogaloo's weren't. They were attacking and they wear rainbow flags. They wear anti-fuss shirts. They are anti-fuss.
[25:54.960 --> 26:06.960]  They are anti-fuss. And the few that got arrested have been released without charge. Email their own video saying, we are going to burn this place down.
[26:06.960 --> 26:17.960]  I'm going to show you all of it. In Austin, they were up there giving anti-fuss speeches, basically promoting Marxism and saying, join the Second American Revolution.
[26:17.960 --> 26:24.960]  Join the Second Amendment and trying to recruit people. But wait till I show you the photos I've got. I forgot to send them to the crew.
[26:24.960 --> 26:33.960]  These people look like mutants from Mars or something. You just see them and you go, oh my God, that's Antifa.
[26:33.960 --> 26:40.960]  Then you listen to their speeches. That's who they are. So it's all coming up, folks. And then are there some Boogaloo's that are real folks?
[26:40.960 --> 26:42.960]  Accelerationists that get sucked in. Yeah.
[26:42.960 --> 26:48.960]  But the guys all wearing the mask, those are FBI informants and FBI HRT leading you right into hell.
[26:48.960 --> 27:13.960]  And their main target is the U.S. military. That's their number one enemy.
[27:13.960 --> 27:19.960]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.960]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine.
[27:24.960 --> 27:30.960]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[27:30.960 --> 27:38.960]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things. We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[27:38.960 --> 27:43.960]  These are real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses,
[27:43.960 --> 27:48.960]  never come out and are taught we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[27:48.960 --> 27:55.960]  You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[27:55.960 --> 28:09.960]  Q is a Bolshevik operation. Q is a relaunch of operation trust that the Soviets used in the 1920s to identify who their opposition was.
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.960]  That's when George Arwell wrote 1984 that was about a futuristic, Stalinistic world government system.
[28:15.960 --> 28:25.960]  He talked about Emmanuel Goldstein, who was the supposed leader of the resistance, but really worked for the controllers to be able to identify anyone that was a dissident.
[28:25.960 --> 28:31.960]  That's what's happening. So the storm of Q is real. It's a globalist martial law takeover of America.
[28:31.960 --> 28:39.960]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but you have been had. I was suspicious of it, knew what it was early on, but did not realize it was the main thrust.
[28:39.960 --> 28:47.960]  The main thrust the globalist takeover is Operation Trust 2.0. We're covering it all live on the air at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[28:47.960 --> 28:52.960]  We'll have reporters on the ground covering the inauguration of the Communist Chinese spy Biden.
[28:52.960 --> 28:55.960]  The globalists are planning false flags. We pray we can stop them.
[28:55.960 --> 29:07.960]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[29:07.960 --> 29:13.960]  Where did it come from?

[30:18.960 --> 30:35.960]  Newswars.com is tomorrow's news. Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:35.960 --> 30:39.960]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to understand something.
[30:39.960 --> 30:55.960]  I now know exactly what's going on. And it's important people understand this is not just another radio show, not just another TV show, or not just some conspiracy person that covers UFOs or things like that.
[30:55.960 --> 31:08.960]  I actually study and immerse myself in what's going on. I'm not just on the air. I'm not just reading and researching or talking to a wide spectrum of individuals, but I'm also in the field.
[31:08.960 --> 31:12.960]  I also grew up around people that were involved in a lot of things.
[31:12.960 --> 31:16.960]  And when I tell you this is going on, this is what's going on.
[31:16.960 --> 31:28.960]  I told you a week and a half ago when they staged this false flag in DC that I wasn't sure what happened. I was there, but I had limited perspective in the middle of the crowd, in the middle of people arriving.
[31:28.960 --> 31:37.960]  Within the 24 hours, I had a good understanding. I had an excellent understanding, but I wasn't 100% sure. I'm 100% sure who did this now.
[31:37.960 --> 31:41.960]  I'm going to show you a stack of articles where they even admit it all. It's all right there.
[31:41.960 --> 31:49.960]  A coordinated, organized group did this. The feds wanted to go down that path and suddenly the U.S. attorney goes, oh, we're not looking at that now.
[31:49.960 --> 31:55.960]  No, no, no. No organized. Nothing was organized. No.
[31:55.960 --> 31:59.960]  Because it was organized by them.
[31:59.960 --> 32:14.960]  I don't think the U.S. attorney obviously that guy, but I mean up the chain, this was done by really evil people at the CIA and the Pentagon who know they're going to go to robot forces soon and need to now spike and phase out the human element.
[32:14.960 --> 32:17.960]  So humance being removed.
[32:17.960 --> 32:24.960]  And so the globalist AI system is the enemy that is parasitically sucking the U.S. dry.
[32:24.960 --> 32:33.960]  And there's only a competition with globalists about who gets the AI takeover will be China's AI or the U.S. AI, but it's Satan's plan that it's really all the same AI.
[32:33.960 --> 32:39.960]  Lord of the Rings allegory 10 rings given to 10 kings of the earth above all seek power.
[32:39.960 --> 32:47.960]  So Christian allegory Tolkien said this about what he experienced a super high level professor at the highest levels of the insider knowledge.
[32:47.960 --> 32:55.960]  And so 10 rings are given to 10 kings for power. But when they take the power, they actually become enslaved.
[32:55.960 --> 32:59.960]  And there's one secret ring that controls them all. That's Satan.
[32:59.960 --> 33:04.960]  That's a spiritual element.
[33:04.960 --> 33:06.960]  So.
[33:06.960 --> 33:08.960]  Got chills.
[33:08.960 --> 33:10.960]  Let's let's go over it.
[33:10.960 --> 33:19.960]  The FBI vetting National Guard troops in DC have been fears of insider attack Fox News. You just can't trust that military.
[33:19.960 --> 33:24.960]  Because again, the key thing is the secret military going to overthrow Trump.
[33:24.960 --> 33:30.960]  Going to overthrow Biden coming up on the 20th.
[33:30.960 --> 33:34.960]  But really it's the overthrow of Trump who was really elected by landslide.
[33:34.960 --> 33:41.960]  America and it's a military dictator ship being brought in. But the real purge is going to be of the military, just like they did in Russia.
[33:41.960 --> 33:51.960]  Just like they did in China, just like they did in Guatemala, just like they did in Venezuela, just like they did in Cuba in North Korea.
[33:51.960 --> 33:59.960]  And they will then control the opposition through Boogaloo's and others.
[33:59.960 --> 34:04.960]  And they will then recruit people in who think they're in the opposition so they can imprison them.
[34:04.960 --> 34:17.960]  Absolutely insane. And the Q people will go to these events believing they're there to save the country and they'll be the people that are actually arrested while they let the convicted terrorists and other people that were there who were arrested go.
[34:17.960 --> 34:20.960]  Let's go over it.
[34:20.960 --> 34:25.960]  FBI vetting National Guard troops in DC amid fears of insider attack.
[34:25.960 --> 34:31.960]  Moving concerns. Razor wire and no Trump at inauguration like no other.
[34:31.960 --> 34:37.960]  Now this is the key article from zero hedge dot com about it added to the live show feed of the show today.
[34:37.960 --> 34:41.960]  Under the feet of the broadcast dealing with the death of America.
[34:41.960 --> 34:48.960]  We have this article posting says all the tweets and all the videos showing the Boogaloo's with their rainbow flags.
[34:48.960 --> 35:04.960]  They're tropical shirts saying we're with BLM we're for violence and then you can see the military HRT types that you never see their faces next to just totally low IQ 75 IQ idiots they recruited.
[35:04.960 --> 35:11.960]  And they're just waiting to try to trick them into violence as accelerationist to clamp down on the country.
[35:11.960 --> 35:20.960]  So this is just how gangs use the low level gang members it's the exact same exact same psychology they've all been promised immunity you name it.
[35:20.960 --> 35:31.960]  Arm protests begin to arrive at state capitals around the nation and notice covid was a mastermind program to take over the banking to take over the digital tracking to take over total control to make you stay in your house to say you're not essential.
[35:31.960 --> 35:41.960]  But also during the period of the global revolution everyone's wearing mask usually someone wearing a mask you know is the bad guy because they're hiding what they're doing and they're doing something the various.
[35:41.960 --> 35:47.960]  But now they can all wear their mask because you're supposed to you see how it's all super computer.
[35:47.960 --> 35:52.960]  But there's a little something extra there a master intelligence that's not a supercomputer if you know what I mean.
[35:52.960 --> 35:54.960]  Old scratch.
[35:54.960 --> 36:02.960]  So arm protesters begin to arrive at state capitals around the nation. They hate Trump.
[36:02.960 --> 36:09.960]  But they want civil war to demonize the Second Amendment to be the trigger for the total breakdown.
[36:09.960 --> 36:19.960]  They saw our Virginia rally last January 4050,000 people peacefully black white old young together under freedom it scared the hell out of the globalist another reason they trigger this whole operation.
[36:19.960 --> 36:29.960]  They know we were successfully healing the nation and getting self defense positioned again and causing a great unification and great awakening via the great realignment.
[36:29.960 --> 36:34.960]  That article has been reposted with all the photos all the videos and then four wars dot com it's okay.
[36:34.960 --> 36:41.960]  FBI arrest hardcore anti the leftist for planning to attack Florida State Capitol. You got to go look at this guy.
[36:41.960 --> 36:43.960]  Pull up this article guys I'm going to show this guy's face.
[36:43.960 --> 36:51.960]  Now this is the idiot. The big tough guys that are in good shape with their faces all covered their uniforms all perfect are the Boogaloo leaders.
[36:51.960 --> 37:00.960]  But the little meth head guys and the fat boys and all the rest of them the video game warping players they're like cute people.
[37:00.960 --> 37:06.960]  They just believe that they're there and they're going to carry out this big glorious attack and they're going to kill the military and kill the police.
[37:06.960 --> 37:08.960]  They're just meant to usher in the crisis.
[37:08.960 --> 37:14.960]  This article of police look at it. They all have that same look. You know mama left him in a crib 20 hours a day.
[37:14.960 --> 37:20.960]  You know his brains are third the size of it should be I'm not being mean here and he just he wants to be a man.
[37:20.960 --> 37:24.960]  He wants to be tough and he's totally programmed and now he's in federal custody.
[37:24.960 --> 37:29.960]  That's who the fed shame on them set up what a nasty creature continuing.
[37:29.960 --> 37:37.960]  Oh did you notice the issue with the news about an insider attack on inauguration day town hall saying it.
[37:37.960 --> 37:39.960]  Yeah we were told it was an insider attack.
[37:39.960 --> 37:43.960]  But now town hall says why have they gone away from that because it shows that Trump didn't want this to happen.
[37:43.960 --> 37:45.960]  Of course Trump didn't want to get violent.
[37:45.960 --> 37:49.960]  It was a show that America is awake and then a show that he could get big numbers.
[37:49.960 --> 37:54.960]  That's why I like the idea of it to say that we're not going to stand for fraud and we want an investigation in Congress.
[37:54.960 --> 37:56.960]  That was the open stated aim with Trump.
[37:56.960 --> 37:58.960]  You always know he's very very transparent.
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.960]  But they're going to say why did this happen because it makes Trump look good if somebody else organized it.
[38:03.960 --> 38:10.960]  That's not the issue. Who organized it. The Boogaloo's are in the zero hedge article.
[38:10.960 --> 38:19.960]  The leaders bragging that they've come that they work with BLM that has 10.6 billion dollars and George Soros and they hate Trump and that they hate conservatives.
[38:19.960 --> 38:21.960]  But they want a violent revolution now.
[38:21.960 --> 38:24.960]  They're just communists calling themselves Boogaloo's.
[38:24.960 --> 38:32.960]  But how do you get regular military and FBI and an ADL troops and the rest of them into a group.
[38:32.960 --> 38:34.960]  You cover your faces. You call yourselves Boogaloo's.
[38:34.960 --> 38:36.960]  And now you can lead it.
[38:36.960 --> 38:38.960]  True terrorist organization.
[38:38.960 --> 38:40.960]  And they're stated that.
[38:40.960 --> 38:42.960]  But see, they're above the law.
[38:42.960 --> 38:45.960]  Look at this article. John Sullivan, father's a top general,
[38:45.960 --> 38:50.960]  released conditionally without bail by Utah federal judge after he's done these attacks over and over again before.
[38:50.960 --> 38:52.960]  They say he leads them all.
[38:52.960 --> 38:56.960]  Hundreds of rioters destroyed property, set fires during Trump's 2017 inauguration,
[38:56.960 --> 38:59.960]  and all charges were dropped, including Senator Cain's son.
[38:59.960 --> 39:02.960]  Because they have to get out of jail free card.
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.960]  Trump bans, Twitter bans Trump.
[39:04.960 --> 39:10.960]  But left wing activists charged in capital riots still active on platform.
[39:10.960 --> 39:13.960]  They're talking about their little darling.
[39:13.960 --> 39:16.960]  The Fed just released John Sullivan.
[39:16.960 --> 39:18.960]  You see how it works?
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.960]  In a communist revolution, their forces pose as the opposition under operations trust and others.
[39:24.960 --> 39:29.960]  And then they never get in trouble or arrested or they get released and you go to prison for nothing.
[39:29.960 --> 39:31.960]  This is how they're going to do it.
[39:31.960 --> 39:34.960]  They're not coming. They're here.
[39:34.960 --> 39:37.960]  Meanwhile, homeless people set a tent on fire on accident.
[39:37.960 --> 39:41.960]  So they locked the whole capital out. Everybody ran screaming in all directions like cockroaches.
[39:41.960 --> 39:45.960]  This is the mind control we're under as America is now on its knees,
[39:45.960 --> 39:49.960]  shaking in its boots, afraid of its own shadow, being politically correct.
[39:49.960 --> 39:53.960]  And all that's going to give you total depression, forced inoculation and death.
[39:53.960 --> 39:56.960]  And I know you want it. So you're going to get three, two, one.
[40:24.960 --> 40:28.960]  Paul and Block again is available in this one minute ad.
[40:28.960 --> 40:33.960]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally.
[40:33.960 --> 40:39.960]  Unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[40:39.960 --> 40:41.960]  This is naturally occurring.
[40:41.960 --> 40:47.960]  It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us.
[40:47.960 --> 40:49.960]  You chew up the pills. They taste great.
[40:49.960 --> 40:54.960]  It's available again at infowarstore.com.
[40:54.960 --> 40:59.960]  I want to warn all patriots in the United States and across the world that listen to my voice.
[40:59.960 --> 41:05.960]  I'm Alex Jones. I've been in this fight 27 years and I've studied every angle of their operations.
[41:05.960 --> 41:09.960]  And I'm here to tell you as clear as day.
[41:09.960 --> 41:17.960]  They have organizations on message boards and other groups posing as patriot leaders and posing as President Trump,
[41:17.960 --> 41:23.960]  anonymously telling you to have arm marches in all 50 states coming up on the 20th and before that.
[41:23.960 --> 41:25.960]  You are being set up.
[41:25.960 --> 41:33.960]  I was there in D.C. with a million peaceful people and I watched Antifa and other leftist groups pose our people and set us up.
[41:33.960 --> 41:36.960]  Thank God the Patriots did not engage in the rioting.
[41:36.960 --> 41:38.960]  So only a few people did it.
[41:38.960 --> 41:40.960]  So the thing was a misfire.
[41:40.960 --> 41:45.960]  It was a dud, but the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters terrorist
[41:45.960 --> 41:50.960]  and they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th to blame the American people.
[41:50.960 --> 41:52.960]  Do not be part of it.
[41:52.960 --> 41:55.960]  We are peaceful. We are not violent.
[41:59.960 --> 42:01.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[42:01.960 --> 42:03.960]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[42:03.960 --> 42:09.960]  I have looked at every facet of this and now the only days until the inauguration of the CHICOM agent,
[42:09.960 --> 42:11.960]  it's all coming into place.
[42:11.960 --> 42:13.960]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[42:13.960 --> 42:15.960]  They change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[42:15.960 --> 42:21.960]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order
[42:21.960 --> 42:26.960]  and now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19 and that's what it is,
[42:26.960 --> 42:31.960]  to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[42:31.960 --> 42:32.960]  They train you to stay in your houses.
[42:32.960 --> 42:33.960]  They train you to be tracked.
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.960]  They train you to do what you're told for nine, ten months as training wheels and now they launch the storm.
[42:38.960 --> 42:40.960]  The storm is here.
[42:40.960 --> 42:42.960]  It's a global storm.
[42:42.960 --> 42:44.960]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[42:44.960 --> 42:46.960]  There's going to be martial law for the globalist.
[42:46.960 --> 42:48.960]  They're trying to set you up.
[42:48.960 --> 42:50.960]  Don't be involved in violence.
[42:50.960 --> 42:53.960]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[42:53.960 --> 42:56.960]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[42:56.960 --> 43:00.960]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[43:00.960 --> 43:04.960]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[43:04.960 --> 43:08.960]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[43:08.960 --> 43:13.960]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[43:13.960 --> 43:19.960]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[43:19.960 --> 43:23.960]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque
[43:23.960 --> 43:29.960]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[43:29.960 --> 43:34.960]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[43:34.960 --> 43:41.960]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[43:41.960 --> 43:46.960]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[43:46.960 --> 43:49.960]  about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[43:49.960 --> 44:06.960]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[44:19.960 --> 44:26.960]  I almost forgot Alex Jones here back live.
[44:26.960 --> 44:32.960]  One of our great listeners in the show, I'll leave it at that since you're discriminating against,
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.960]  went down the supposed right wing uprising to overthrow the capital
[44:36.960 --> 44:41.960]  and it was literal Antifa all looking like methad child molesters.
[44:41.960 --> 44:43.960]  I'm not saying they're methad or child molesters.
[44:43.960 --> 44:45.960]  I'm just saying, wait till I show the people next hour.
[44:45.960 --> 44:51.960]  I mean, they look like if you were casting for, there was a giant nuclear war that killed 98% of human life,
[44:51.960 --> 44:58.960]  but 400 years later, a new mutant race emerged and I'm going to show you these people
[44:58.960 --> 45:04.960]  and they're literally like spouting, we're with BLM, overthrow the government, blow everything up,
[45:04.960 --> 45:09.960]  we're with Trump because they're so dumb, they're sent out there as leftists to do this
[45:09.960 --> 45:13.960]  and say that they're with the patriots and the news is like, look at right wing extremists.
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.960]  They've got like rainbow flags on.
[45:18.960 --> 45:19.960]  It's all next level.
[45:19.960 --> 45:21.960]  It's coming up next hour.
[45:21.960 --> 45:30.960]  Greg Reese and some of our other team members are on top of rooftop that we've rented nearby there to cover the inauguration
[45:30.960 --> 45:37.960]  and you can see the armored fortress that they have built around the once quasi free capital.
[45:37.960 --> 45:41.960]  You can see the stage built there for Biden to perch atop.
[45:41.960 --> 45:44.960]  Maybe get the guys to zoom in a little bit and I'll go to them in a few minutes.
[45:44.960 --> 45:49.960]  We're going to be talking to Greg Reese here in a second, but understand.
[45:49.960 --> 45:56.960]  We need to put quick, easy, compact special reports together like five, ten minutes long, we will today.
[45:56.960 --> 45:58.960]  We'll post a Band-Aught video that you can share.
[45:58.960 --> 46:03.960]  So it's not just this four hour show where we have the names of the Boogaloo's.
[46:03.960 --> 46:07.960]  We have them admitting they went into the capital violently that they led the insurrection
[46:07.960 --> 46:14.960]  and then you look at them and it's obvious real paramilitary professionals that look better than the regular military
[46:14.960 --> 46:19.960]  totally covered up with a bunch of middle patients.
[46:19.960 --> 46:23.960]  And I'll show the next clip with the guys with their faces totally covered leading these people.
[46:23.960 --> 46:25.960]  This is a takeover.
[46:25.960 --> 46:31.960]  These guys all have PhDs in psychology and stuff and sociology and it's not these guys.
[46:31.960 --> 46:35.960]  You showed some of them earlier with their faces totally covered in their military outfits.
[46:35.960 --> 46:40.960]  But yeah, this is a giant honeypot operation.
[46:40.960 --> 46:46.960]  And then the media says the Boogaloo's are with Trump even though they're not.
[46:46.960 --> 46:51.960]  And then if they ever talk out of school, it's all Marxist-Leninist crap.
[46:51.960 --> 46:54.960]  I have photos of them with the arm patches with it all.
[46:54.960 --> 46:55.960]  Yeah, that's not it.
[46:55.960 --> 46:56.960]  We've already shown this a bunch.
[46:56.960 --> 46:58.960]  You showed it earlier in an earlier segment.
[46:58.960 --> 47:00.960]  Just don't show it anymore until you find it.
[47:00.960 --> 47:01.960]  It's fine.
[47:01.960 --> 47:06.960]  It's a bunch of people in full camo with their faces covered as well.
[47:06.960 --> 47:09.960]  And they're dressed right and they're in shape.
[47:09.960 --> 47:12.960]  And they've got a bunch of what looks like mutants around them.
[47:12.960 --> 47:14.960]  That's what I'm talking about, but it's fine.
[47:14.960 --> 47:16.960]  The crew's doing a great job.
[47:16.960 --> 47:19.960]  It's a TV show, so I'm directing it from the chair.
[47:19.960 --> 47:20.960]  So it's a little weird.
[47:20.960 --> 47:22.960]  Nobody else does it like this.
[47:22.960 --> 47:28.960]  And so then I'm just telling them what I want live on air and they're not telepathic, so it's not their fault.
[47:28.960 --> 47:29.960]  But it doesn't matter.
[47:29.960 --> 47:33.960]  The videos are in the Zero Hedge article that if you go to the live show feed, we put that up.
[47:33.960 --> 47:37.960]  The live show feed article of the show today.
[47:37.960 --> 47:40.960]  Zero Hedge has done the best job showing you these groups.
[47:40.960 --> 47:47.960]  They don't point out that the Boogaloo's are leftist and want to start a war and enter with the George Soros funded BOM.
[47:47.960 --> 47:48.960]  But that is all effect.
[47:48.960 --> 47:54.960]  And we have the same group here in Austin, not even calling themselves Boogaloo's.
[47:54.960 --> 47:55.960]  Can we show the live feed of the show?
[47:55.960 --> 47:56.960]  It's an article here.
[47:56.960 --> 47:57.960]  I'll pull it up.
[47:57.960 --> 47:58.960]  No problem.
[47:58.960 --> 47:59.960]  I'll just have to do it myself.
[47:59.960 --> 48:00.960]  Let me see.
[48:00.960 --> 48:02.960]  All righty then.
[48:02.960 --> 48:04.960]  And we will go through the live show feed.
[48:04.960 --> 48:10.960]  Ron Paul, the unwelcome return of the real purveyors of violence, Twitter.
[48:10.960 --> 48:11.960]  Yeah, there it is.
[48:11.960 --> 48:12.960]  It's official.
[48:12.960 --> 48:18.960]  The United States of America no longer exists and is in an occupied vassal state.
[48:18.960 --> 48:19.960]  Watch live.
[48:19.960 --> 48:22.960]  And again, I don't want to be negative like that.
[48:22.960 --> 48:24.960]  I don't want to tell you this kind of stuff.
[48:24.960 --> 48:28.960]  But do you understand why I'm so pissed off right now and about to start screaming?
[48:28.960 --> 48:34.960]  I have a stack of news articles and quotes and videos from the people saying they attacked
[48:34.960 --> 48:36.960]  the Capitol, saying they did it to set up Trump.
[48:36.960 --> 48:39.960]  I have the name of the guy that's been caught everywhere doing it, being released by a federal
[48:39.960 --> 48:43.960]  judge, bragging he came with a hundred Antifa to set us up.
[48:43.960 --> 48:44.960]  The police stood down.
[48:44.960 --> 48:45.960]  They did this.
[48:45.960 --> 48:47.960]  A few coup people followed in.
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.960]  And it absolutely nothing wrong except take a couple of pieces of paper.
[48:52.960 --> 48:58.960]  Nothing wrong except take a couple pieces of mail or sit in the speaker of the House
[48:58.960 --> 49:01.960]  of the leader of the Senate, Mike Pence's chair.
[49:01.960 --> 49:05.960]  And I'm not saying do that, but they got totally led into it.
[49:05.960 --> 49:08.960]  Like, let's play that clip of the Q shaman.
[49:08.960 --> 49:12.960]  This is the video you'll be seeing all over Tucker Carlson tonight.
[49:12.960 --> 49:17.960]  The Q shaman marching in and they're having a little bit of a celebration and one guy's
[49:17.960 --> 49:19.960]  been shot in the face by a rubber bullet.
[49:19.960 --> 49:20.960]  The only violence is against them.
[49:20.960 --> 49:23.960]  And the cops like, Hey, can you take your feet off the coffee table?
[49:23.960 --> 49:27.960]  Basically, you're in a sacred house of these globalist devils.
[49:27.960 --> 49:28.960]  Here's the video.
[49:28.960 --> 49:29.960]  Hey.
[49:29.960 --> 49:30.960]  Hey, man.
[49:30.960 --> 49:32.960]  Glad to see you guys.
[49:32.960 --> 49:33.960]  You guys are.
[49:33.960 --> 49:34.960]  Patriots.
[49:34.960 --> 49:35.960]  Look at this guy.
[49:35.960 --> 49:36.960]  He's got covered in blood.
[49:36.960 --> 49:37.960]  God bless you.
[49:37.960 --> 49:38.960]  Yes.
[49:38.960 --> 49:39.960]  You good, sir?
[49:39.960 --> 49:40.960]  Do you need medical attention?
[49:40.960 --> 49:41.960]  I'm good.
[49:41.960 --> 49:42.960]  Thank you.
[49:42.960 --> 49:43.960]  All right.
[49:43.960 --> 49:45.960]  I got shot in the face.
[49:45.960 --> 49:49.960]  I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet.
[49:49.960 --> 49:52.960]  Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate?
[49:52.960 --> 49:53.960]  Wait, wait a minute.
[49:53.960 --> 49:56.960]  I'll be making sure they're disrespecting the place.
[49:56.960 --> 49:57.960]  Okay.
[49:57.960 --> 49:59.960]  This is like the sacredest place.
[49:59.960 --> 50:00.960]  The sacredest place.
[50:00.960 --> 50:04.960]  We're Chuck E. Schumer and all those hunchback devil worshipers walking around.
[50:04.960 --> 50:06.960]  So it's a perfect dichotomy.
[50:06.960 --> 50:08.960]  You have Antifa leading the attack.
[50:08.960 --> 50:10.960]  They got there before Trump even began speaking.
[50:10.960 --> 50:12.960]  Riot police come out to face them.
[50:12.960 --> 50:16.960]  Then Antifa attacks cops and then retreats into the crowd to try to trick the crowd,
[50:16.960 --> 50:21.960]  which is in the 2015 documents we got from Maryland headline,
[50:21.960 --> 50:27.960]  Obama planned martial law using Antifa in Maryland.
[50:27.960 --> 50:29.960]  And it all is how they tried to trigger black crowds.
[50:29.960 --> 50:31.960]  Well, this is the same thing.
[50:31.960 --> 50:34.960]  The news says, oh my God, an innocent black man got killed.
[50:34.960 --> 50:35.960]  Go out and riot.
[50:35.960 --> 50:37.960]  A couple hundred black folks show up.
[50:37.960 --> 50:38.960]  Antifa starts burning things.
[50:38.960 --> 50:41.960]  Black people get the blame.
[50:41.960 --> 50:44.960]  So Antifa leads the attack.
[50:44.960 --> 50:46.960]  Bogalus go in, help break in.
[50:46.960 --> 50:48.960]  Bragg, they've done the whole thing online.
[50:48.960 --> 50:50.960]  They don't get in trouble.
[50:50.960 --> 50:57.960]  But Q. Shaman and the rest of the folks believing that they were there and that the storm was here
[50:57.960 --> 50:59.960]  and they were acting for the president.
[50:59.960 --> 51:02.960]  They just sat back and relaxed because you've got the president.
[51:02.960 --> 51:03.960]  Trust the plan.
[51:03.960 --> 51:06.960]  As we one go, we all go.
[51:06.960 --> 51:08.960]  See, they didn't do anything wrong.
[51:08.960 --> 51:10.960]  They just meant well and were delusional,
[51:10.960 --> 51:13.960]  but they're the ones that will go to federal president now.
[51:13.960 --> 51:16.960]  Not all the organizers, not the people that said burn it down,
[51:16.960 --> 51:18.960]  not the ones that handed out clubs on video.
[51:18.960 --> 51:20.960]  No, some FBI did their job and arrested them,
[51:20.960 --> 51:22.960]  but as soon as they get in front of a federal judge,
[51:22.960 --> 51:24.960]  you may go free my son.
[51:24.960 --> 51:30.960]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[51:30.960 --> 51:31.960]  See how it works.
[51:31.960 --> 51:32.960]  And then it goes on.
[51:32.960 --> 51:35.960]  They say a prayer and then they leave.
[51:35.960 --> 51:36.960]  That video is on infowars.com.
[51:36.960 --> 51:39.960]  They say a prayer and then they leave.
[51:39.960 --> 51:42.960]  But see, you see hundreds of thousands of people like I did.
[51:42.960 --> 51:44.960]  I told them that they're attacking inside.
[51:44.960 --> 51:46.960]  I thought hundreds of thousands were.
[51:46.960 --> 51:48.960]  No, maybe 150.
[51:48.960 --> 51:50.960]  I've watched all the footage has been released.
[51:50.960 --> 51:54.960]  That's why most people walked within the velvet ropes.
[51:54.960 --> 51:58.960]  Let's cut back for a moment of our rooftop vantage of the capital
[51:58.960 --> 52:02.960]  and the throne area that has been at a live feed.
[52:02.960 --> 52:06.960]  We have a live cam feed, by the way, at band.video
[52:06.960 --> 52:10.960]  in the martial law inauguration section
[52:10.960 --> 52:12.960]  where they're posting all of the videos.
[52:12.960 --> 52:14.960]  So be sure and follow all that at band.video.
[52:14.960 --> 52:16.960]  And then I'm just going to say this if I want to settle down,
[52:16.960 --> 52:17.960]  because I'm very, very upset.
[52:17.960 --> 52:19.960]  I'm going to start the next hour and I'm going to walk all through this
[52:19.960 --> 52:21.960]  very judiciously.
[52:21.960 --> 52:23.960]  And then there's the dog collars you're going to wear
[52:23.960 --> 52:25.960]  and the shot collars you're going to wear that are being announced
[52:25.960 --> 52:26.960]  to make sure you come and comply.
[52:26.960 --> 52:27.960]  I'm not joking.
[52:27.960 --> 52:29.960]  The force inoculations are now saying,
[52:29.960 --> 52:31.960]  we're going to give you 5, 10, 20 shots.
[52:31.960 --> 52:33.960]  It just, it didn't matter if you die.
[52:33.960 --> 52:35.960]  Hundreds dead now confirmed.
[52:35.960 --> 52:37.960]  They're covering up thousands very sick.
[52:37.960 --> 52:38.960]  Total hell on earth.
[52:38.960 --> 52:40.960]  I mean, this is the main assault.
[52:40.960 --> 52:42.960]  This is the main assault.
[52:42.960 --> 52:44.960]  Because we killed all those babies and said they weren't human.
[52:44.960 --> 52:46.960]  And the God said, OK, protection gone
[52:46.960 --> 52:48.960]  and the globalists are going to gang rape us.
[52:48.960 --> 52:50.960]  So we can get back to God.
[52:50.960 --> 52:52.960]  And I'll just separately, if you want to keep us on air, fine.
[52:52.960 --> 52:54.960]  If you don't, that's fine as well.
[52:54.960 --> 52:55.960]  I appreciate all your support.
[52:55.960 --> 52:56.960]  I appreciate your prayers.
[52:56.960 --> 52:58.960]  I appreciate your support in the local stations.
[52:58.960 --> 52:59.960]  I'm not trying to be negative here.
[52:59.960 --> 53:01.960]  I'm just telling you the reality of this.
[53:01.960 --> 53:03.960]  America better understand what's happening.
[53:03.960 --> 53:05.960]  Get right with God and get right back to basics
[53:05.960 --> 53:07.960]  like the CEO of Goya Foods said.
[53:07.960 --> 53:09.960]  And you better start supporting the truth,
[53:09.960 --> 53:11.960]  those local radio stations that are picking us up.
[53:11.960 --> 53:13.960]  You better start telling folks about those
[53:13.960 --> 53:15.960]  because with the censorship coming,
[53:15.960 --> 53:18.960]  that's all that's going to be on the air, folks.
[53:18.960 --> 53:20.960]  Because even if they take us off the internet,
[53:20.960 --> 53:22.960]  we're going to still be beaming out to those local stations
[53:22.960 --> 53:24.960]  and they're going to be able to put it out on their internet
[53:24.960 --> 53:25.960]  for at least a while.
[53:25.960 --> 53:27.960]  Or they can roll over to the New World Order.
[53:27.960 --> 53:29.960]  That's up to them.
[53:29.960 --> 53:31.960]  What we're seeing is more stations picking us up,
[53:31.960 --> 53:33.960]  stations taking us from nighttime to daytime
[53:33.960 --> 53:35.960]  and really investing in their future,
[53:35.960 --> 53:37.960]  rolling over to this means total destruction.
[53:37.960 --> 53:40.960]  This is do or die time, George Washington time
[53:40.960 --> 53:42.960]  when it comes to information warfare.
[53:42.960 --> 53:44.960]  The great globalist reset is here.
[53:44.960 --> 53:46.960]  Get prepared while you still can.
[53:46.960 --> 53:50.960]  All those big 50% off deals on X2 back in stock
[53:50.960 --> 53:53.960]  and on all those great products
[53:53.960 --> 53:55.960]  that were massively discounted.
[53:55.960 --> 53:57.960]  Supermell Vitality, X2,
[53:57.960 --> 53:59.960]  Alpha Power Chill Force, Lung Clean,
[53:59.960 --> 54:00.960]  Survival Shield X3,
[54:00.960 --> 54:03.960]  the liquid pure turmeric extract is super strong,
[54:03.960 --> 54:05.960]  just as good as bodies in my view.
[54:05.960 --> 54:07.960]  Some people like it better, some people don't.
[54:07.960 --> 54:09.960]  They like it as much, it's excellent.
[54:09.960 --> 54:10.960]  Pure turmeric extract.
[54:10.960 --> 54:12.960]  All that 50% off.
[54:12.960 --> 54:14.960]  Polyblock 25%, Alpha Power 50%.
[54:14.960 --> 54:16.960]  Pure turmeric extract again,
[54:16.960 --> 54:18.960]  selling out fast bodies.
[54:18.960 --> 54:20.960]  That's selling out all.
[54:20.960 --> 54:22.960]  Those are all 50% off, it's at Polyblock 25.
[54:22.960 --> 54:24.960]  They're all selling out.
[54:24.960 --> 54:27.960]  So I've got to have the prices go up next Sunday or Monday.
[54:27.960 --> 54:29.960]  You've got about six, seven days of those deals
[54:29.960 --> 54:30.960]  and then they've got to go away.
[54:30.960 --> 54:32.960]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[54:32.960 --> 54:34.960]  Whatever you do, tell folks to tune in now.
[54:34.960 --> 54:36.960]  That's how we override the globalists.
[54:36.960 --> 54:38.960]  What they're doing, so criminal, so crazy.
[54:38.960 --> 54:40.960]  We've got a chance to beat them,
[54:40.960 --> 54:42.960]  but first people got to know what's really happening
[54:42.960 --> 54:44.960]  and what's coming next.
[54:44.960 --> 54:47.960]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[54:47.960 --> 54:50.960]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[54:50.960 --> 54:52.960]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[54:52.960 --> 54:54.960]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday
[54:54.960 --> 54:56.960]  when I heard you got that fresh shipment
[54:56.960 --> 54:58.960]  of Living Defense in from Utah.
[54:58.960 --> 55:01.960]  I said, man, I got to get on that show
[55:01.960 --> 55:03.960]  and get him an update.
[55:03.960 --> 55:06.960]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones' show,
[55:06.960 --> 55:09.960]  I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense
[55:09.960 --> 55:11.960]  and what it did for me personally.
[55:11.960 --> 55:14.960]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old, going on 20,
[55:14.960 --> 55:17.960]  thanks to this info for store products.
[55:17.960 --> 55:20.960]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night,
[55:20.960 --> 55:23.960]  so I'm doing what I can, brother.
[55:23.960 --> 55:27.960]  My contention is, why don't we start this new year off right
[55:27.960 --> 55:30.960]  with everybody getting a couple bottles of Living Defense?
[55:30.960 --> 55:33.960]  Now, you got to follow that up with the Microsoft VX.
[55:33.960 --> 55:34.960]  I learned that.
[55:34.960 --> 55:36.960]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.960]  We didn't know. We didn't screen your call.
[55:38.960 --> 55:39.960]  We had no idea.
[55:39.960 --> 55:41.960]  And I go to you a year later,
[55:41.960 --> 55:43.960]  and you're here telling people about Living Defense,
[55:43.960 --> 56:01.960]  Living Defense.
[56:13.960 --> 56:16.960]  You might want to find out who this super villain is,
[56:16.960 --> 56:19.960]  but you see, he believes because he's hidden playing you,
[56:19.960 --> 56:21.960]  and you're not speaking out against it,
[56:21.960 --> 56:23.960]  that he has the right to do it for you.
[56:23.960 --> 56:25.960]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[56:25.960 --> 56:27.960]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[56:27.960 --> 56:30.960]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[56:30.960 --> 56:33.960]  That means worldwide neo-futilism in his own words.
[56:33.960 --> 56:36.960]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines
[56:36.960 --> 56:38.960]  to sterilize you before you take those shots.
[56:38.960 --> 56:41.960]  You might just want to find out who this super villain is,
[56:41.960 --> 56:43.960]  all right?
[56:43.960 --> 57:12.960]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[57:12.960 --> 57:38.960]  We survived that.
[57:38.960 --> 57:41.960]  All you Yuppies that got to settle the sidelines.
[57:41.960 --> 57:44.440]  You're going to have everything, you're going to wrap it up.
[57:44.440 --> 57:48.120]  Yeah, finally, nothing.
[57:48.120 --> 57:49.280]  It's not that I like any of this.
[57:49.280 --> 57:50.920]  I'm not an acceleration.
[57:50.920 --> 57:53.400]  I love peace more than anybody.
[57:53.400 --> 57:58.520]  But once we get God's protection gone,
[57:58.520 --> 58:00.960]  I would be surprised if God didn't blow this whole planet up
[58:00.960 --> 58:05.280]  or so satanic and just start over completely.
[58:05.280 --> 58:07.000]  We already got told the plan, though.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.360]  Oh, it's trust the plan.
[58:09.360 --> 58:12.800]  You can say it was a misunariat protectorate, the type of thing
[58:12.800 --> 58:14.200]  that Frank Herbert wrote about.
[58:14.200 --> 58:16.600]  But I think that's a delusion of the globalist.
[58:16.600 --> 58:18.080]  And they are following God's plan,
[58:18.080 --> 58:20.680]  even though they think they're going to outsmart God.
[58:20.680 --> 58:22.040]  God is in charge.
[58:22.040 --> 58:24.720]  And I trust the plan.
[58:24.720 --> 58:30.440]  Not the plan of 8chan, but the real plan of Jesus of Nazareth.
[58:30.440 --> 58:32.400]  OK, I did an OK job first hour.
[58:32.400 --> 58:34.880]  But I went into manic phase because I'm so upset about what's
[58:34.880 --> 58:45.640]  happening, things are so epic, I'm going to breathe, because you
[58:45.640 --> 58:49.240]  tune in to hear the breakdown.
[58:49.240 --> 58:50.800]  And after Gregory sleeves us, he's
[58:50.800 --> 58:54.520]  going to be popping in our great reporter from the rooftop
[58:54.520 --> 58:57.520]  there above the Capitol and all the checkpoints
[58:57.520 --> 59:00.000]  he went through and what he witnessed,
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.600]  just to get from his hotel two blocks away.
[59:02.600 --> 59:04.400]  That's his camera right there, you see.
[59:04.400 --> 59:11.120]  If you're a TV viewer, we are going to take your calls.
[59:11.120 --> 59:13.800]  And then Jason Jones is going to pop in as well while we take
[59:13.800 --> 59:15.000]  calls.
[59:15.000 --> 59:18.560]  He's a great patriot, a great veteran, a very smart fellow.
[59:18.560 --> 59:21.240]  And he witnessed the false flag at the Capitol.
[59:21.240 --> 59:23.040]  And I want to get his take on where
[59:23.040 --> 59:25.680]  he thinks we should go and what we should do as well.
[59:25.680 --> 59:29.480]  But I intend to take calls coming up.
[59:29.480 --> 59:31.040]  And I intend to take calls from anyone
[59:31.040 --> 59:33.440]  that was at the Capitol.
[59:33.440 --> 59:35.760]  And what your view of this is now,
[59:35.760 --> 59:38.200]  and law enforcement and military.
[59:38.200 --> 59:40.600]  Law enforcement military that were at the Capitol a week
[59:40.600 --> 59:43.000]  and a half ago or there now, anybody
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.720]  involved in security in DC, your view of what's happening.
[59:45.720 --> 59:48.320]  But you have to understand, the reason I'm so pissed
[59:48.320 --> 59:51.320]  is I wanted to just think, OK, maybe this isn't as bad
[59:51.320 --> 59:51.800]  as I thought.
[59:51.800 --> 59:53.080]  This is an operation.
[59:53.080 --> 59:55.800]  Trust, 100% it is.
[59:55.800 --> 59:58.280]  And I'd already talked about trust in Emmanuel Goldstein
[59:58.280 --> 1:00:02.440]  and things like that months ago, but before this even happened
[1:00:02.440 --> 1:00:08.200]  and the Boogaloo's, but I just, they
[1:00:08.200 --> 1:00:11.640]  were so inactive compared to what they did
[1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:14.120]  and their capabilities on the sex.
[1:00:14.120 --> 1:00:16.200]  And I was just worried about, hey, Trump's in control.
[1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:18.440]  And I'm sure, but no, he was isolated.
[1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:21.800]  That we walked right into a damn trap.
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:23.160]  And you can arm share quarterback.
[1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:24.680]  And you can fight the last war forever.
[1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:32.480]  But this morning and last night, I was watching footage
[1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:37.880]  that people posted on Facebook of these things around the country.
[1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:44.920]  And I mean, it is literally communists saying they're
[1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:46.840]  communists dressed up saying they're patriots.
[1:00:46.840 --> 1:00:50.360]  I mean, they're so dumb that they're like, we're communists.
[1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:51.120]  We're a BLM.
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:54.200]  And we we're going to have guns and overthrow things.
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:55.640]  And then the media, they go to media.
[1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:57.760]  Yeah, I'm here because of the election in Trump.
[1:00:57.760 --> 1:00:59.160]  And then the guy goes over five minutes later
[1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:00.760]  and admits everybody, I'm not with Trump.
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:02.880]  I mean, it's crazy.
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:05.600]  And the Boogaloo's admit they did this.
[1:01:05.600 --> 1:01:08.040]  And of course, you're going to see them arrested.
[1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:11.120]  No, they're not going to arrest HRT members.
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:14.400]  I mean, you've got FBI agents in there running this damn thing.
[1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:18.240]  God, we're in so much trouble.
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:20.480]  And again, I'm not saying those guys, the agents,
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:23.600]  the guys with the Black Lives Matter and the Antifa Shirts.
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:26.600]  It's it's the video you showed later of the people in full camo
[1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:31.640]  and full mask that are definitely got squared away there.
[1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:34.120]  And I can just tell you learn things.
[1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:36.400]  Just look at them and simply, you know, what's going on.
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:41.080]  OK, so much more coming up later.
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:42.600]  We'll review the show later when we show it.
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:44.640]  Find that clip, play it for you tomorrow.
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:47.760]  But I'm going to stop obsessing on that at this point.
[1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:54.440]  We'll stop now and we'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[1:01:54.440 --> 1:02:00.720]  Q is a Bolshevik operation.
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:03.800]  Q is a relaunch of Operation Trust
[1:02:03.800 --> 1:02:06.160]  that the Soviets used in the 1920s
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:08.120]  to identify who their opposition was.
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:10.640]  That's when George Arwell wrote 1984
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:12.680]  that was about a futuristic, Stalinistic,
[1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:14.040]  world government system.
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:16.520]  He talked about Emmanuel Goldstein,
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:18.880]  who was the supposed leader of the resistance,
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:21.480]  but really worked for the controllers
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:23.920]  to be able to identify anyone that was a dissident.
[1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:24.920]  That's what's happening.
[1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:27.000]  So the storm of Q is real.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.480]  It's a globalist martial law takeover of America.
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:33.760]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but you have been had.
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:35.920]  I was suspicious of it, knew what it was early on,
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:38.560]  but I didn't realize it was the main thrust.
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:40.200]  The main thrust, the globalist takeover,
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:42.560]  is Operation Trust 2.0,
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:46.760]  we're covering it all live on the air at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:48.360]  We'll have reporters on the ground
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:51.440]  covering the inauguration of the Communist Chinese spy bite.
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:53.120]  The globalists are planning false flags.
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:03:13.000]  We pray we can stop them.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:25.200]  Let's get out on the highway, looking for adventure, and whatever comes our way.
[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:27.280]  I look at you all excited and jazzed up.
[1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:29.960]  Yeah, I got stuck in my finger in a light socket, man.
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:31.880]  This is the end of America.
[1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:33.440]  And I'm warming my hands on the fire.
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:37.600]  I'm not happy about it.
[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:42.080]  I like using the analogy from that great John Carpenter movie I talked about last week,
[1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:47.000]  where they're burning down the whole Antarctic base to try to kill the alien.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:50.480]  There's two guys left, and they think one of the guys is the alien, the other isn't.
[1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:54.160]  And he says, yeah, we better enjoy this really hot, you know, fires.
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:56.360]  We're all sweating here, because in about an hour, they'll be out.
[1:03:56.360 --> 1:03:58.560]  We'll freeze to death in minutes.
[1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:01.280]  So, I mean, I mean, there's a lot of energy going on,
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:03.760]  because, I mean, this is the end of the country, folks.
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:08.000]  And I don't say that to be exaggerating or be mean about it.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:11.120]  You better mark the point we got taken over,
[1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:13.480]  and then they're going to start the mass reeducation,
[1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:16.400]  starving everybody out, making you salute them,
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:19.560]  making you prove to them you're a good little minion to have a job.
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:23.760]  This is going to be so humiliating for the American people.
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:28.640]  This is going to make Sherman's reconstruction of the South look like a cake walk,
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.720]  a tea party, an exercise in enjoyment.
[1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:34.480]  I mean, you're going to, let me tell you,
[1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:39.000]  in five years to even have a job, you'll have to cut your son's balls off at a government facility.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.120]  And I'm not joking.
[1:04:40.120 --> 1:04:42.040]  That's the sacrament already in the UK.
[1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:45.240]  They're putting only executives in that are transgender everywhere now,
[1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:46.800]  men that cut their testicles off.
[1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:50.360]  It's not, you have to have the paperwork that you cut your balls off.
[1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:52.440]  I mean, the globalists are like, you want a job?
[1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:53.600]  Chop your testicles off.
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:04:56.920]  I mean, this is a cult that the UK's announcing it.
[1:04:56.920 --> 1:04:59.920]  They already have it in New Zealand.
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:01.360]  They just announced it in France.
[1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:05.600]  You're going to wear dog collars that track you to go outside.
[1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:06.880]  I'm not joking.
[1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:08.720]  There's no limit.
[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:10.760]  The floor's out, the bottom's out.
[1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:11.760]  It's over.
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:12.640]  It's over.
[1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:15.840]  It's over.
[1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:22.120]  Until people get educated about the facts we're covering and what's really going on.
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:26.120]  You want me to show you a newscast about taser bracelets that you're going to have to wear to travel?
[1:05:26.120 --> 1:05:31.200]  It's all been planned already.
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:32.840]  And I said I'd be calm in this segment.
[1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:38.120]  I want to take your calls, first time callers who were at the event
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:42.560]  on the 6th or have been in DC since then or if you're part of the military that's there
[1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:45.680]  now or law enforcement, I want to hear from those groups.
[1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:46.680]  Please, folks.
[1:05:46.680 --> 1:06:06.000]  Don't call if you're not those groups because I want to hear from those folks, 877-789-2539-877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539-877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539-877-789-ALEX.
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  And I just want to boom.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:11.360]  I can tell me what you saw, what you thought in a minute, I'll move the next person.
[1:06:11.360 --> 1:06:22.200]  But if you just tuned in, the whole last hour could have been condensed into two minutes.
[1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:29.040]  It's confirmed that the deep state ran the Boogaloo Boys via the Southern Primary Law
[1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:34.680]  Center ADL and the FBI to break in and attack the Capitol.
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:36.600]  They've all bragged about it with Antifa.
[1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:37.600]  They've been protected.
[1:06:37.600 --> 1:06:41.680]  When they were arrested, they were released.
[1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:43.640]  And we walked right into a trap.
[1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:44.640]  They did stand down.
[1:06:44.640 --> 1:06:51.360]  They ushered the Q people who were not violent in to be killed and in to be arrested as sacrificial
[1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:55.560]  dummies, just like in spies like us, a great comedy, but very accurate.
[1:06:55.560 --> 1:06:59.400]  You're like, oh, we're going to accelerate you guys to be front-line spies, really, with
[1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:00.400]  like two weeks' training.
[1:07:00.400 --> 1:07:01.400]  Yeah.
[1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:02.400]  And they put them in as decoys.
[1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:05.880]  Of course, they end up doing a better job than the actual spies, which is how it actually
[1:07:05.880 --> 1:07:09.560]  works, because real people get real stuff done, not you mentally ill, sick of freaks
[1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:13.040]  that have Asperger's or whatever it is, Satanic Asperger's.
[1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:14.760]  I don't mean Asperger's is Satanic.
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:23.080]  I mean, a form of it that's like Satanic is disgusting.
[1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:24.760]  So it's all right here.
[1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:29.080]  And I told you last week, I said, watch, they'll start saying it's the military has to be
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:30.080]  watched.
[1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:31.080]  They're a Trump supporter.
[1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:33.760]  So if you're a Trump supporter, it's illegal and the FBI is going to get you.
[1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:40.960]  Now Fox News is reporting that FBI vetting National Guard troops in DCM in fears of insider
[1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:41.960]  attack.
[1:07:41.960 --> 1:07:42.960]  Oh, anti-terrorism.
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:48.640]  So now if you support free speech or support election integrity or support President Trump,
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:49.640]  you're a terrorist.
[1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:54.240]  So now you've got to, like all the Green Berets were up in Utah last week wearing red high
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:58.440]  heels and learning about transgenderism as part of their brainwashing.
[1:07:58.440 --> 1:07:59.440]  Did you know that?
[1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:00.440]  You won't see that on the news.
[1:08:00.440 --> 1:08:03.960]  This is what's going on.
[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:04.960]  Now they're seeing it.
[1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:10.480]  Oh, we can't trust the military, especially they've got to be put through sensitivity
[1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:11.480]  training.
[1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:13.680]  They're bad people.
[1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:17.600]  And that's all operation trust, targeting the military, telling people they're part
[1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:21.560]  of secret agent operations, getting them to carry out terror attacks, which are then blamed
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.320]  on the military in general.
[1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:26.920]  The military is the target or the final groups to be taken down.
[1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:32.520]  Joining us is another veteran Marine Corps veteran and Patriot and great journalist,
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:33.520]  Greg Reaves.
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:36.880]  You normally see his amazing reports at man.video, some of our best right up there with John
[1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:42.640]  Bown and the rest of the great crew, but he's there on top, that rooftop right above
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:45.440]  the Capitol, watching the martial law below.
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:46.680]  Thank you for joining us.
[1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:49.640]  You've got the floor here to describe what you saw, what you witnessed and what it's
[1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:50.640]  like there.
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:54.800]  And what do you make the first of the Boogaloo's officially admitting that they attacked the
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:59.840]  Capitol with antifa, they're very proud of themselves, none of them would be arrested.
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:02.440]  Any that are being released without bail, they're being celebrated.
[1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:06.800]  I mean, they're even, they might have like awards on TV for them for setting up Trump
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:10.920]  in this oxymoron world where they blame us, but they did it, they're very proud of themselves
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:11.920]  right now.
[1:09:11.920 --> 1:09:14.560]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex.
[1:09:14.560 --> 1:09:18.360]  The only time I ever ran into the Boogaloo boys was in Richmond, Virginia on the stop
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:20.040]  to steal caravan.
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:23.560]  When we arrived in Virginia, they showed up fully armed.
[1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:27.840]  And what was very strange was they were extremely upset that we had our own armed security.
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:32.400]  They were claiming, as if it was their jurisdiction, as if they were there to protect everyone,
[1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:34.400]  which right off the bat seemed extremely...
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:38.840]  Well, the feds always take over a group segment of the security, that's FBI, those are FBI
[1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:39.840]  agents.
[1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:44.520]  They sent this big old FBI agent over and playing clothes with us and it was so, it's so obvious.
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:46.520]  These guys are so shameful.
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:51.680]  You were talking about dog, dog collars and there's zero hyperbole in that because our
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:56.320]  dumbed down population, they want to be slaves, they love the masks and now they're coming
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:00.960]  out in the open with hatred towards any veteran, towards any man who wants to stand up for
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:02.880]  his family, for his country.
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:07.920]  So we're dealing with a massive dumbed down population that is completely ready for the
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:10.680]  dog collars, for the masks, they want it all.
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:15.720]  And when they're being led by these, not just communists, but this crazy Luciferian American
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:20.400]  version of communists, sadomasochist perverts that want nothing more than to mask us all
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:24.920]  up, put us in dog collars and humiliate us to the entire world, which is exactly what's
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:28.480]  happening and the American people seem to love it, they can't get enough of the humiliation.
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:32.640]  Well, that's right, for those that don't know, they're announcing everywhere from Singapore
[1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:36.560]  to France that you will not, you will wear masks permanently, you will not shake hands
[1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:40.720]  and you will wear dog collars and now they're saying they want shocking dog collars.
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:44.040]  If you get closer than six feet, they're going to shock you, I've got that coming up.
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:45.040]  Yeah.
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:46.040]  And the people will love it.
[1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:49.880]  They'll, they'll get, they'll get their special bedazzled decorated dog collars and they'll
[1:10:49.880 --> 1:10:51.520]  be happy with it.
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:56.680]  What I'm seeing out here, Alex is very strange because on one side, you can see they want
[1:10:56.680 --> 1:10:59.240]  to show this massive show of force.
[1:10:59.240 --> 1:11:04.440]  They have the National Guard have rifle slung, but with no magazines, no ammunition, barbed
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:06.240]  wire, concertina wire everywhere.
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:10.400]  But then on the other hand, if you try to take a camera out to take video of it within
[1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:15.360]  10, 20 feet of you at any, at any point we've been, there is law enforcement telling us
[1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:16.360]  to put our cameras away.
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:20.840]  So they don't want us filming it, but yet they're rolling all this drama out.
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:21.840]  It's very strange.
[1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:23.080]  And right here we're on media row.
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:28.480]  So all the longest, we're right next to CNBC, all the longest are the CIA corporate run
[1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:34.040]  mainstream media ready to I'm sure just zoom in on the stage and make this thing look as
[1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:35.160]  normal as can be.
[1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:41.400]  But when you're outside here looking, there's at least 40,000 law enforcement here, the
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:43.480]  curfew at 10 PM, you can't walk on the streets.
[1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:46.760]  If you want to walk on the streets in the daytime, you need an arm bracelet showing
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:48.040]  that you're in a hotel.
[1:11:48.040 --> 1:11:49.720]  So it's a complete lockdown.
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:51.680]  But then on the other hand, they don't want people taking video.
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:53.760]  So it's very strange.
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:55.320]  Never seen anything like this before.
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:59.280]  Well, Greg, you did a great job and I briefed you, you're what they call essential under
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:00.280]  the First Amendment.
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:02.880]  So that's how CNN and others are getting turned to the Capitol.
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:07.840]  So you need to explain to them that your media, that that's your job and then do it with out
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:08.840]  in plain view.
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:11.840]  They've just been trained, it's all a class system, but you're in the media, so you're
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:12.840]  in the God level.
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:15.560]  Have you tried to explain to them that you're the media?
[1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:16.560]  Yes.
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:19.800]  Well, we were really just worried about getting in here at first, but then now that we got
[1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:23.480]  in here and we do have our media badges now, everything looks legit.
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:26.560]  So we should have no problem operating as any other media here.
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:27.560]  Well, sure.
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:29.720]  But I mean, that's the thing is that is that media acts all arrogant.
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:30.720]  Somebody kisses their ass.
[1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:34.440]  We don't act arrogant, we're exercising our free speech and talk to those troops and
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:35.440]  expose them.
[1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:36.440]  You're doing a great job.
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:38.800]  We're going to come back and talk more about what you're witnessing there in our former
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.760]  Capitol now under globalist control.
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:42.800]  We are now officially occupied.
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:49.360]  Joe Biden will be installed in about 46 hours as the first dictator of the United States.
[1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:50.360]  Okay.
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:53.360]  And then we'll all be shut down after that.
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:54.360]  The resistance.video.
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:55.360]  The resistance.video.
[1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:56.360]  The resistance.video.
[1:12:56.360 --> 1:12:57.360]  The resistance.video.
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:12:58.360]  The resistance.video.
[1:12:58.360 --> 1:12:59.360]  The resistance.video.
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:00.360]  The resistance.video.
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:15.200]  Infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video, and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:16.200]  been banned.
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:24.320]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Bill Gates
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:26.560]  and the globalists are on our tail.
[1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:31.200]  But the new website is theresistance.video.
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.200]  The resistance.video.
[1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:37.560]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and it can defeat them.
[1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:43.080]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries,
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:48.080]  all the special reports, and all the suppressed information is at theresistance.video.
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:54.160]  Share the link, theresistance.video, theresistance.video.
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:58.840]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products,
[1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:03.160]  Infowars are no longer available, and I thought that pollen block might be gone forever, but
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:08.840]  after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:10.960]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:16.760]  It's a proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:21.560]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:27.880]  So get your pollen block back in stock at infowarsstore.com today, and by the way, activated
[1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:30.760]  charcoal toothpaste sold out for months is now back in stock as well.
[1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:35.120]  They're great products and it funds the infowar, so get your pollen block and get your activated
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:37.480]  charcoal toothpaste at infowarsstore.com today.
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:42.640]  Again, our activated charcoal toothpaste doesn't have additives, it's concentrated, people
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:46.800]  love it, it's amazing, there's no toothpaste out there like it, and pollen block is a proprietary
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:47.800]  as well.
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:15:15.640]  All right, let me try to be calm right now, and then I'll come back in the next segment
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:20.200]  and take your calls, Alex Jones here back live.
[1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:25.280]  I can talk about solutions and how to fix this as well, and I probably shouldn't obsess
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:29.800]  for the entire broadcast about the Boogaloo's, bragging they went and staged a capital event
[1:15:29.800 --> 1:15:32.640]  with anti-further there above the law.
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:37.440]  It's all admitted, we sent people down to the Texas capital, other folks posted photos
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:41.600]  and videos that we'll be showing you here on screen while Greg Reese talks of the folks
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:46.840]  in Austin that the news says are rightly extremists there to overthrow the election, when it's
[1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:48.440]  the globalist that stole the election.
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:53.120]  So this is all just a discredit protest, discredit the Second Amendment ahead of false flags
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:54.120]  that are coming.
[1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:57.600]  But you got a lot of stuff going on, look at this article, panic.
[1:15:57.600 --> 1:16:02.680]  Pelosi sends a letter to Acting Defense Secretary Miller demanding an immediate halt to attempt
[1:16:02.680 --> 1:16:07.520]  to install new NSA General Counsel Michael Ellis, cites it as highly irregular and highly
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:08.520]  suspect.
[1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:14.360]  The NSA is refusing to declassify the illegal spying and crossfire hurricane.
[1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:17.240]  So it's the president's right to release that.
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:22.640]  And I think with this type of action, Trump is going to pardon Julian Assange tomorrow.
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:24.360]  I'm predicting that right now.
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:30.120]  My gut tells me that Trump's good, and that Trump is the final crucible to the right thing.
[1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:33.680]  So get ready for that, I believe it's what my gut tells me that that's Trump's decision
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:34.680]  right now.
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:38.080]  I don't have any inside sources, just my spirit tells me Trump may change his mind, but that's
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:39.080]  what's happening right now.
[1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:43.680]  I think he'll pardon him at 8 a.m. Eastern tomorrow morning.
[1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:47.480]  Okay, so we've got that information.
[1:16:47.480 --> 1:16:52.280]  Going back to Gregory's and the meager crew we have up there in D.C. doing a great job.
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:57.440]  Other observations, other things you've seen, what you think's coming next here, my friend?
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:04.200]  Well, what I can't help but think is they're trying to stage this whole thing for some
[1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:07.640]  kind of false flag narrative.
[1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:11.420]  The reason I say that is because we just got a report that they shut down the rehearsal
[1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:14.200]  just now because of a threat.
[1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:17.040]  Apparently it's being reported that it was a homeless man's tent on the other side of
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:18.160]  the Capitol.
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:20.640]  That reminds me of Antifa in Austin, Texas.
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:24.520]  We got that viral video of Antifa burning the homeless people's mattresses.
[1:17:24.520 --> 1:17:26.760]  So that seems like they're here now.
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:31.320]  The other three, they apparently had some threat today and they had to not let people
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:32.320]  in.
[1:17:32.320 --> 1:17:36.520]  CNN was doing the crazy reporting on the gunman who came in with 500 rounds.
[1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:40.760]  So all the National Guard are here with rifles, no ammunition, no magazines.
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:42.760]  So what exactly is going on?
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:47.840]  It almost does seem like they are preparing for some major false flag event, just something
[1:17:47.840 --> 1:17:52.800]  to another excuse to come after our guns, strike while the iron's hot, because right
[1:17:52.800 --> 1:18:00.280]  now this dumbed-down population, the Maskeys, they're just openly hating on any veterans,
[1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:05.400]  any masculine man, any God-fearing country-loving woman and man.
[1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:09.000]  They're just out in the open hating on us as if we're some kind of archaic-nustle threat.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.120]  That's why they got their boogaloo's out doing all this.
[1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:16.400]  And since you mentioned it, a couple hours ago they had to halt setting things up because
[1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:21.840]  a homeless camp, one tent burned and then they used that to shut stuff down like a backfire
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:22.840]  happened a few years ago.
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:24.040]  They evacuated the Capitol.
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:26.360]  This is the wicked fleeing when none pursue.
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:32.680]  Here's what happened.
[1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:36.440]  Can you compare this to the inauguration in 2017 of Donald Trump?
[1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:43.560]  I mean, there were riots out in the open cars burning and the media applauded it.
[1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:44.560]  You're absolutely right.
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:46.440]  A new footage got released at Gateway Pundit.
[1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:50.080]  Film crew released an ever-foreseen footage of 2017 inauguration riots.
[1:18:50.080 --> 1:18:51.080]  We were there.
[1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:54.240]  They were physically attacking us, attacking women and children, trying to get in, beating
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:55.240]  up reporters.
[1:18:55.240 --> 1:18:56.880]  I mean, hundreds were arrested.
[1:18:56.880 --> 1:19:00.400]  They were all charges dropped for savage attacks.
[1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:07.480]  Absolutely, the woman who bombed the Capitol in 1983 gets taken care of by Bill Clinton.
[1:19:07.480 --> 1:19:12.560]  So if you want to destroy this country, if you want to riot and loot and burn things
[1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:19.320]  down and destroy private businesses, then you're protected, then you're a hero.
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:23.800]  But if you want to stand up for your country, if you want to protect your birthright, if
[1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:27.720]  you want to stand up for freedom and independence, now you're an enemy of the state.
[1:19:27.720 --> 1:19:28.720]  I totally agree.
[1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:30.120]  It's completely upside down.
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:31.960]  Where do you see this going, Greg?
[1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:36.160]  Well, you know, coming out here was a very interesting feeling because it's like God
[1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:40.880]  only knows what's going to happen now because right now they've got the momentum.
[1:19:40.880 --> 1:19:42.560]  They've got the narrative.
[1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:48.960]  And so to me, I don't see this going anywhere but south very quickly because they've got
[1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:50.360]  the momentum.
[1:19:50.360 --> 1:19:54.640]  They can honestly start rounding up patriots and Trump supporters right now and it'll
[1:19:54.640 --> 1:19:56.320]  satiate the population.
[1:19:56.320 --> 1:19:57.720]  The people will cheer it.
[1:19:57.720 --> 1:19:59.040]  So why wouldn't they do that?
[1:19:59.040 --> 1:20:00.040]  That's what I wonder right now.
[1:20:00.040 --> 1:20:02.920]  Why wouldn't they take advantage of this opportunity and do that?
[1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:05.880]  Yeah, it'll look terrible to the rest of the world, but the rest of the world is going
[1:20:05.880 --> 1:20:07.280]  to the New World Order too.
[1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:09.680]  So it'll just be setting an example for the whole world.
[1:20:09.680 --> 1:20:13.960]  Humiliate and destroy America and that'll destroy the spirit of patriots all over the
[1:20:13.960 --> 1:20:15.520]  world.
[1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:18.360]  Why wouldn't they do that?
[1:20:18.360 --> 1:20:20.440]  It's just an insane time to live.
[1:20:20.440 --> 1:20:24.760]  We are witnessing such incredible history unfold and I want to stop it and I want to
[1:20:24.760 --> 1:20:25.760]  have answers.
[1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:28.000]  But we have a dumbed-down immoral population.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:32.600]  We have a large minority of black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young Christians who
[1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:34.040]  are the main opposition.
[1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:37.200]  We have the murder of Christians up 60% just last year alone.
[1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:39.200]  It's already doubled the decade before that.
[1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:42.320]  I mean, this is an exponential slaughter of Christians worldwide.
[1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:45.400]  We see pure evil rising, pedophilia rising.
[1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:49.400]  We see open Marxist groups attacking the capital dressed up like us.
[1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:51.360]  A few Q idiots follow in, that's it.
[1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:53.920]  They call it a New Pearl Harbor.
[1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:55.920]  Have you seen the footage of the Q wizard?
[1:20:55.920 --> 1:20:58.760]  He just walks in joking and laughing.
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:01.680]  And then they call that the most vicious assault the planet's ever seen.
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:03.520]  He gets arrested and charged.
[1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:08.520]  But Boogaloo is saying they came there for violence, caught, nothing happens to them.
[1:21:08.520 --> 1:21:13.400]  And whatever these people are told by the media, they just believe without question.
[1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:18.760]  It's unbelievably humiliating, I think, for America, for the whole world to be seeing
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:20.640]  what's happening here right now.
[1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:21.640]  And you're right.
[1:21:21.640 --> 1:21:27.960]  How can you get across the point that all summer long, all over the country, cities
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:33.960]  are burning, people are getting murdered, hundreds killed, and everyone's OK with that.
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:40.000]  And one small event at the capital in DC, and now they're ready to lock us all up and
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:41.920]  put us in reeducation camps.
[1:21:41.920 --> 1:21:42.920]  It's a...
[1:21:42.920 --> 1:21:43.920]  Oh, by the way, I forgot that.
[1:21:43.920 --> 1:21:49.800]  From Brian Stelter to AOC to the View, they say put Trump supporters in prisons.
[1:21:49.800 --> 1:21:54.640]  They're saying reeducation camps on TV, and just notice that's totally normal now.
[1:21:54.640 --> 1:21:59.880]  They burn down thousands of buildings, they're good, a few patriots follow their people in
[1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:03.920]  and break some glass, and it's the end of America, sorry, you're all getting arrested.
[1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:04.920]  Yeah.
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:10.280]  And you know, Alex, for years, for years, you've been warning people about this, and
[1:22:10.280 --> 1:22:13.760]  people may have accused you of fear mongering or whatever.
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:16.520]  We are way beyond that point right now.
[1:22:16.520 --> 1:22:18.320]  We are sitting at the cliff.
[1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:22.760]  I don't see...I don't see any way out of this, I mean, because it seems like they've got
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:25.680]  us backed up into a corner.
[1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:28.320]  I don't know what they're about to do here Wednesday.
[1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:29.320]  Maybe it'll just be a normal...
[1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:32.760]  Oh, this is just all an exercise of power, they'll probably stage a false flag in the
[1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:34.240]  states or something.
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:38.480]  But yeah, this is all just about an exercise of their...to show China, hey, we're in total
[1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:43.120]  martial law control, to show China that they own us.
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:46.040]  And they're doing a good job, because I'll tell you what, the elite in China have got
[1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:49.560]  to be celebrating, toasting champagne, and laughing their asses off right now.
[1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:53.600]  Oh, they actually are, and they're major people's daily saying, we own America, they're over,
[1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:57.400]  we will use COVID, they will never reopen, they're telling investors, and they're flooding
[1:22:57.400 --> 1:22:58.400]  into China.
[1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:03.120]  They say, Biden's going to cut U.S. energy off, we are open, America's over.
[1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:04.120]  It's over, man.
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:05.120]  I mean, they are announcing it.
[1:23:05.120 --> 1:23:06.120]  It's over.
[1:23:06.120 --> 1:23:09.840]  And they act like, oh, the Navy's recruiting to fight China BS, we've been sold out, we've
[1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:12.960]  been sold out, it's over, unless we admit it's over.
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:14.120]  We are gone.
[1:23:14.120 --> 1:23:15.120]  It's over.
[1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:19.840]  Unless we, all of us come together, our state legislatures, our pastors, our people, and
[1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:23.360]  break with the globalist, if we don't have that instinct, it's over.
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:26.960]  Greg Rees, you are doing a great job, get out there, I know, on the street, get some
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:27.960]  more live reports.
[1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:31.480]  I'd go to them and say, hey, we're media, let's see it into the capitals, say you want
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:32.480]  to go show what happened there.
[1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:36.840]  CNN wasn't trying to stop the riots like we did, they were with this guy inside trying
[1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:38.720]  to fan the flames.
[1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:44.880]  So great job, there's a section now at band.video, Biden's installation via DC martial laws,
[1:23:44.880 --> 1:23:49.160]  the name of the section, Biden's installation is the section at band.video.
[1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:50.960]  Greg Rees, God bless and good luck.
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:54.600]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:58.640]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer,
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:02.600]  all pushing the covers, the most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's
[1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:07.600]  a very weak flu or cold, but if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:10.240]  That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing homes.
[1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:15.560]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:21.040]  come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically bioweapons
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:25.520]  that are super deadly and now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically when
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:29.480]  they take it just like newborn babies, they give vaccines, they have to resuscitate them
[1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:33.320]  all the time or a lot of times they just let them die and that's on the record, it does
[1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:34.320]  that.
[1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:38.000]  Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you, safe and
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  effective.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  No one's getting hurt.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  And then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:47.640]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous
[1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:53.320]  because the media says it's safe, they do it.
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:56.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history, I've interviewed all the experts.
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:02.120]  I have looked at every facet of this and now, only days until the inauguration of the Chai
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:04.760]  Com agent, it's all coming into place.
[1:25:04.760 --> 1:25:07.960]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud, it's how they change the subject from
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:14.400]  Hunter's laptop, it's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda
[1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:20.000]  and the New World Order and now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19 and that's
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.200]  what it is, to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:28.120]  They train you to stay in your houses, they train you to be tracked, they train and do
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:32.640]  what you're told for nine, ten months as training wheels and now they launch the storm.
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:36.120]  The storm is here, it's a globalist storm.
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:40.920]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump, there's to be martial law for the globalist.
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:45.600]  They're trying to set you up, don't be involved in violence, expose the New World Order and
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:50.320]  expose the takeover with information, that's how we beat these people, with truth.
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:54.640]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:59.360]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including
[1:25:59.360 --> 1:26:04.440]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune
[1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:05.440]  system.
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:11.400]  Producing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at InfowarsStore.com.

[1:26:53.240 --> 1:27:17.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:27.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:30.360]  It is the Alex Jones show and I'm your host Alex Jones and we are going to go to your
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:31.360]  phone calls right now.
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:36.400]  We'll have Jason Jones on about 15 after next hour because I'm going to run a little bit
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:37.400]  late today.
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:38.400]  We really appreciate him joining us.
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:41.920]  He was at the Capitol and witnessed what happened as well.
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:47.560]  Okay, I've mainly focused on the martial law and I'm mainly focused on how they say
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:52.080]  the military is the enemy now and no one can be trusted but leftists that are avowed communists.
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:53.080]  They are the good guys.
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:54.080]  They can be trusted.
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:55.320]  Communist China can be trusted.
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:57.080]  Kamala Harris can be trusted.
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:01.360]  Joe Biden can be trusted and then the Boogaloo Boys all brag how they broke in and attacked
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:02.360]  the Capitol.
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:05.760]  Let me show you all their tweets and those are up and the other individual that launched
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:07.920]  the attack with 100 Antifa, he brags he did it.
[1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:14.640]  He was with CNN leading the attack and the CNN even has him on and he's released by a
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:20.800]  federal judge with no, no, no, no bond, no bail.
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:25.040]  So that's where all this is folks and these people can do whatever they want.
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:28.640]  They're above the law because they're backed by the billionaires and by the chai comms and
[1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:31.960]  by the globalist and they think they're just going to push Americans out of the way and
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:39.000]  ban our rights and call the attack the greatest attack in U.S. history because they killed
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:43.600]  four U.S. citizens and one copped out of our attack two days later.
[1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:50.040]  Yep, there's John Sullivan in there saying burn it down, burn it down, lead the whole
[1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:58.960]  thing with a CNN reporter with the CIA operative Anderson Cooper screwing America over again.
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:04.560]  Anderson Cooper supported the Arab Spring burning down our allies attacking Egypt.
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:06.840]  That was all good killing tens of thousands of Christians.
[1:29:06.840 --> 1:29:15.320]  Oh, but when people get led into the capital by Anderson Cooper's best buddy, whose dad's
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:20.800]  a big U.S. general who got caught sneaking off with the nuclear triggers, oh yes, a really
[1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:22.880]  nice group of people.
[1:29:22.880 --> 1:29:24.280]  He's here to hurt Trump and hurt America.
[1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:27.920]  Well, you do that by, oh, you're coming to protest our election theft, we'll just break
[1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:28.920]  in and blame it on you.
[1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:29.920]  How does that sound?
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:34.000]  I mean, how many thousands of times do you hear about, oh, a synagogue attack or, oh,
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:38.400]  a black college attack or, oh, the dorm got attacked, you know, in the Air Force or whatever.
[1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:44.720]  Somebody was writing in word on the, on the refrigerators and then an officer orders the
[1:29:44.720 --> 1:29:51.280]  young black cadet to do it and it staged to create division and control because the
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:29:53.160]  globalists are taking over.
[1:29:53.160 --> 1:29:55.040]  They don't want our country to exist.
[1:29:55.040 --> 1:29:56.200]  This is the infiltration.
[1:29:56.200 --> 1:29:57.200]  This is the end of America.
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:01.160]  And if you don't admit it's the end of America, it will be.
[1:30:01.160 --> 1:30:05.000]  By admitting we're under attack, by admitting this is globalist, by admitting that they've
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:09.920]  collapsed the third world with the COVID lockdowns and now the UN has set up giant refugee centers
[1:30:09.920 --> 1:30:14.560]  to make the hundreds of thousands that caravan here a few years ago that Trump stopped look
[1:30:14.560 --> 1:30:18.080]  like insignificant.
[1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:22.200]  Let's go ahead for radio listeners, TV viewers can see this, roll that little newscast about
[1:30:22.200 --> 1:30:27.160]  the 7,000 folks, that isn't 7,000, let me give you a news flash.
[1:30:27.160 --> 1:30:29.520]  It's 50,000.
[1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:34.440]  I've seen the footage and that's just the first group of UN trains, they've got debit
[1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:38.080]  cards they paid for by the State Department, Trump cut off the money, but now they do it
[1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:41.880]  directly from Soros and I'm going to go to your phone calls, but that's what's happening.
[1:30:41.880 --> 1:30:43.880]  Go ahead and roll that piece.
[1:30:43.880 --> 1:31:00.880]  Go ahead and roll that piece.
[1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:10.880]  Go ahead and roll that piece.
[1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:17.440]  This is not the video, but it's okay, we've got a lot going on today.
[1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:25.160]  We're going to find the video of the local news and of Sky Television, there's several
[1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:30.840]  of them, you understand what I'm saying, because the key is you need to hear from them that
[1:31:30.840 --> 1:31:36.160]  the COVID lockdown has caused this, has collapsed the third world, they have no jobs, they have
[1:31:36.160 --> 1:31:40.400]  no food, and so the UN then organizes them after shutting them down, after taking their
[1:31:40.400 --> 1:31:45.720]  businesses away, after taking their farming away, after shutting everything down and saying,
[1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:50.760]  creating a global food crisis, now you're going El Norte, now you're going to America,
[1:31:50.760 --> 1:31:56.320]  and as soon as they know Biden is set, they then release and break the dam for the assault.
[1:31:56.320 --> 1:32:13.200]  Here's the newscast.
[1:32:13.200 --> 1:32:16.440]  Seems like when I come in here with this angry energy, it makes the computer not work in
[1:32:16.440 --> 1:32:22.760]  there, it's okay, it's alright, but I'm going to, if somebody just tells me my ear what's
[1:32:22.760 --> 1:32:24.760]  going on, I'll be better.
[1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:30.480]  Central America have ramped up their border controls, as thousands of migrants from Honduras
[1:32:30.480 --> 1:32:34.200]  and Guatemala are heading to the U.S. for a new life.
[1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:39.680]  The region is reeling from a growing hunger crisis after hurricanes hit, as well as violence
[1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:44.400]  and lockdown measures that disrupted the job markets.
[1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:49.800]  On Friday, the first migrant caravan of the year departed Honduras, small skirmishes broke
[1:32:49.800 --> 1:32:56.800]  out between Honduran security forces and migrants at the border with Guatemala as night fell.
[1:32:56.800 --> 1:33:01.760]  But groups of migrants continue to trickle past the border, even as Guatemala military
[1:33:01.760 --> 1:33:07.280]  detained hundreds of migrants, including many families with young children.
[1:33:07.280 --> 1:33:13.920]  Guatemalan officials estimate around 6,500 people to be heading north to the U.S.
[1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:21.720]  Doris Sanchez is one of them. We just want a chance to work. We are defeated. We have
[1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:28.000]  nothing. We are left on the streets. We lost everything. Here, most of us have nothing,
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:37.480]  not even a blanket, tuck into. Guatemala declared emergency powers in seven border
[1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:42.000]  provinces on Thursday, citing pandemic concerns.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:48.080]  Mexico also deployed soldiers and riot police to its border with Guatemala on Friday.
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:53.960]  The exodus comes less than a week before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden,
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:56.480]  who has promised a more humane approach.
[1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:02.240]  Oh, more humane. So they cut their food off, they cut their businesses off, they cut their
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:07.200]  exports to us off, and then they flood here. While we're cut off, we're all under attack.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:10.560]  That woman's under attack, you're under attack, I'm under attack, period.
[1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:13.600]  All right, I'm going to go to break, and I promise for at least four segments, three
[1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:17.920]  segments, I'm going to go write the calls. I'm going to go to Michael, Steve, John,
[1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:23.880]  Christian, Houston, Scott, Preston, Izzy, Richard, Nuthers, and listen, I want to explain
[1:34:23.880 --> 1:34:29.080]  something here to everybody. Okay. If I seem really irritable and mad, it's not with the
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:35.640]  crew. I'm just done with all this, and I meant to come in here today and say this is my last
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:40.080]  broadcast. And by that, I'm going to keep doing shows, but I mean, you understand, folks,
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:42.640]  I believe they're going to shut everything down the next few months. They're going to
[1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:46.720]  blow up federal buildings. They're going to put poison in water supplies. I mean, it's
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:52.080]  over. I mean, it's over. You understand? Your only shot you've got is realizing that we're
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:56.080]  screwed. Your Kandiyash church isn't going to do it. Your Kandiyash boss isn't going
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:00.600]  to do it. We're a trained group of monkeys in this country. We're not what Americans
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:04.120]  used to be. We're not rugged individualists. We don't stand up for the Bill of Rights and
[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:09.840]  Constitution. We're a joke, okay? And so they got people like Brian Skelter up there saying,
[1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:16.760]  shut down all of his competition on TV now. He thinks he owns you. Jeff Sucker thinks he
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:23.200]  owns you. These are bad people, okay? So I've done the best job I can. I'm not bitching
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:27.520]  at the crew or you or anybody. I'm just saying it's hard for me to get up here and do a normal
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:35.760]  show. When we have a group of corporate criminals literally gang raping us. I mean, if we ever
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:40.880]  beat this thing, it'll be in the history of like these people were Hitler. I mean, this
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:45.440]  is unbelievable. It's not like, oh, we're getting there. It's bad. Things are out of
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:50.360]  control. It's, it's, they've just begun. They're going to take your pension funds. They're
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:53.880]  going to bankrupt. They're going to cut the power off the oil off. They're going to open
[1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:58.960]  the borders. It's over, man. It's over. It's all gone. It's all over. They're going to
[1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:03.960]  activate the Boogaloo's FBI ADL terror forces. They're going to start blowing everything
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:07.680]  up. Then they're going to come arrest all the patriots. The idiots will cheer it. They're
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:11.600]  going to shut your power off. They want you starving in the street. They want to rape
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:20.160]  your wife. They're Bolsheviks. They're Jacobins. It's all over, man. All over. Enjoy all your
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:25.880]  games. In fact, America is rotting and deserves it. Now, the Satanists aren't good. They're
[1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:31.840]  not God. God just lets them have their way now. So all your games are over all the TV
[1:36:31.840 --> 1:36:38.200]  watching, all the laziness, all the slack drawings over. It's over. You're going to be just like
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:43.000]  a baby at six months being chopped up at its mother's womb. You're not a human. You're
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:49.480]  not essential. You're dead. They're going to kill you because you don't care.
[1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:52.160]  The best product. I'm not, I'm not supposed to be biased. I'm going to tell you all now
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:57.600]  if you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything.
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:01.040]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:04.680]  crazy week. I don't, I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, turbo force
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:08.560]  is my favorite and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking
[1:37:08.560 --> 1:37:14.280]  control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in
[1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:18.760]  the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going
[1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:22.200]  to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:25.840]  guy over there healthier, happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and
[1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:29.000]  a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:32.320]  had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve
[1:37:32.320 --> 1:37:35.560]  your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that and
[1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:39.200]  that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:42.240]  I want to take control of my health. And that's why you need to go to infowars.com, take control
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:45.800]  of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:50.160]  the Kool-Aid, drink the turbo force. Kool-Aid's bad and the turbo force is good.
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:54.160]  I want to warn all patriots in the United States and across the world that listening
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:37:59.120]  to my voice. I'm Alex Jones. I've been in this fight 27 years and I've studied every
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:05.920]  angle of their operations. And I'm here to tell you as clear as day. They have organizations
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:11.480]  on message boards and other groups posing as patriot leaders and posing as President
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:16.760]  Trump anonymously telling you to have arm marches in all 50 states coming up on the
[1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:22.400]  20th and before that. You are being set up. I was there in DC with a million peaceful
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:28.480]  people and I watched Antifa and other leftist groups, poses our people and set us up. Thank
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:33.320]  God the Patriots did not engage in the rioting. So only a few people did it. So the thing
[1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:39.320]  was a misfire. It was a dud. But the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:43.840]  terrorist and they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th to blame the
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:54.840]  American people. Do not be part of it. We are peaceful. We are not violent. Q is a
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:39:02.640]  Bolshevik operation. Q is a relaunch of operation trust that the Soviets use in the 1920s to
[1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:07.400]  identify who their opposition was. That's when George Arwell wrote 1984 that was about
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:12.920]  a futuristic Stalinistic world government system. He talked about a manual Goldstein
[1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:18.040]  who was the supposed leader of the resistance but really worked for the controllers to be
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:22.120]  able to identify anyone that was a dissident. That's what's happening. So the storm of
[1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:28.600]  Q is real. It's a globalist martial law takeover of America. I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:32.560]  but you have been had. I was suspicious of it, knew what it was early on, but did not
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:37.720]  realize it was the main thrust. The main thrust, the globalist takeover is Operation Trust
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:43.360]  2.0. We're covering it all live on the air at infowars.com and newswars.com. We'll have
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:48.320]  reporters on the ground covering the inauguration of the Communist Chinese spy Biden. The globalist
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:51.360]  are planning false flags. We pray we can stop them.
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:57.960]  The Post Industrial World. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:05.520]  de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:10.320]  a post industrial world plow schwa with the Davos Group, Trudeau and the Prime Minister
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:16.720]  of Canada. They're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030. Well, you might
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:22.320]  want to find out what Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:28.520]  It is making the population more by designs. We can be controlled with a medical technocracy
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:33.520]  over you and your family. They're destroying civilization, rebuild it in their dystopic
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:41.120]  image. We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com. We are fighting for a pro-human
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:46.120]  future and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others and
[1:40:46.120 --> 1:41:12.120]  join the fight. God bless you. Visit us, spread the word at infowars.com.
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:16.560]  That was a very powerful three and a half minute video, a compilation of what I had to say
[1:41:16.560 --> 1:41:23.200]  in a live rant of really clairvoyant level understanding. I only hit those places sometimes.
[1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:28.840]  It's always just like dead on and it's not me. It's God speaking through me in a limited
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:32.920]  way through the rose color darkly that I still distort. Sometimes the light really shines
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:40.720]  through clearly. I explained how they build up the attack until you just get used to submitting
[1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:45.760]  to it and they hit you with a fatal dose of evil. This is the fatal dose. When I tell
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:49.640]  you we're screwed, I don't do that to demoralize you. I think you're like me. I think you want
[1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:54.000]  to know the truth. But the other people are just, oh, I'll wear the mask. Oh, I'll wear
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:58.840]  the dog collar. Oh, I'll have the smart phone. Oh, I'll take the inoculation. Oh, I'll, oh,
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:04.360]  I'll. And then the U.N.'s got 50,000 probably people marching up to break the border. It
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:08.800]  will be millions after that. We know the game plan. My God, they tell us what they're going
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:15.000]  to do. And then it just gets worse and worse. Once we're in a collapsed economy, they can
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:20.160]  dictate every facet of your life to you. That's why they're on these shows. I mean, five years
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:25.280]  ago, if we had one clip of national TV saying, let's put people in reeducation camps, we'd
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:30.640]  be airing in every segment. I probably saw five clips this morning of national news saying,
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:34.520]  we need to arrest all Trump supporters and reeducate them in camps. They're not saying
[1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:41.640]  that for no reason. We need emergency legislative events. We need the states lining up against
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:45.640]  this. We need all the big churches coming out against it. We need all the men that I
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:51.680]  see on the golf courses or polishing their porches or their jet boats to spend some time
[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:59.080]  caring about this. But all the successful men keep their heads down. And it makes me
[1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:03.640]  sick because you're not successful. You're the ones that took our birthright and crapped
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:10.200]  it away. That's why I'm pissed, man. I'm really pissed off right now. We got a case of communist
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:15.080]  cancer. I just love the crew and I love the listeners and I appreciate you all. And I've
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:20.040]  been trying to not get mad like this on here. Well, I tell you, we're screwed, folks. It's
[1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:31.320]  not to demoralize you. It's to let you know. We have to stop taking this like it's normal.
[1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:37.560]  Where I go now, I take my mask off or refuse to wear it and have a whole discussion at
[1:43:37.560 --> 1:43:40.320]  a Mexican food restaurant with people and they take their mask off and agree with me
[1:43:40.320 --> 1:43:45.440]  and shake my hand. And my family goes, you know, well, they've got used to it now. Now
[1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:50.400]  they do it. I'm at war with these people, not just on air. I'm constantly fighting them
[1:43:50.400 --> 1:44:00.760]  and I'm not, I'm not special. I'm just not dead inside. I mean, I can see where this
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:06.040]  is leading. It's an avalanche, folks. Before it was just the snow of tyranny on us. No,
[1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:12.520]  I like snow. It's okay. And all of a sudden, it collapses. All right, I said I go to your
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:15.840]  calls. I really appreciate you getting Christian and John. Everybody's holding on. I'm trying
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:21.080]  to get to Ollie and I really appreciate you. But I mean, when I start thinking about my
[1:44:21.080 --> 1:44:25.600]  last broadcast, because any one of these should be my last broadcast. I mean, this is, this
[1:44:25.600 --> 1:44:30.080]  is it, folks. I start thinking about all the things I want to say and all the things I
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:34.880]  want to do. It just makes me mad that our precious country is being literally sucked
[1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:50.280]  into a black hole of world government. You understand they are announcing shock collars
[1:44:50.280 --> 1:44:55.360]  and shock bracelets and bracelets and dog collars for everyone to wear. Okay. I mean,
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:45:02.640]  I have the newscast. The plan is they're going to be shocking collars. But I was, oh, you're
[1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:08.120]  wearing a collar now to show your COVID thing and it tracks you and social businesses. No,
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:12.120]  no, no. The actual meetings are about having a shocker in it. And the public's like, I
[1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:19.960]  love my shocker. I'm not joking. Not communist China. Homeland security is having meetings
[1:45:19.960 --> 1:45:27.840]  about shockers you wear around your neck. I mean, hell, you let convicted pedophiles
[1:45:27.840 --> 1:45:31.320]  go to elementary schools and have your six year old daughters and sons bounce up and
[1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:37.800]  down on their erections. I mean, literally, I watch these videos. We can't even air these
[1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:42.320]  on air. I can't even look at them of some fat pot belly dude with a little six year
[1:45:42.320 --> 1:45:47.680]  old girl on him riding his crotch. He's got an erection. This is what they do on TV. And
[1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:51.200]  then they cut to the local newscaster. He goes, well, gotta get them when they're young.
[1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:56.440]  Oh, he's a leader. He just goes along with it. Gotta get the children when they're young.
[1:45:56.440 --> 1:46:01.960]  Huh? Do you think you're safe in a world where they got kids with pedophiles on TV? Do you
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:10.360]  think you're safe? You dumb son of a bitch. You think they're safe when they're now we
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:13.840]  know the COVID vaccine kills old people at a very high percentage rate. You think we're
[1:46:13.840 --> 1:46:23.520]  safe when they're killing all the old people? And do you think God likes us when we do that?
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:28.560]  It's all going to burn. All of you that think you're smart and you're part of the system
[1:46:28.560 --> 1:46:33.480]  is you can manipulate those under you. It's all going to come back on you a trillion fold.
[1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:44.320]  I'm just saying right now, I will not be part of this. I will not submit to it. You know,
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:53.000]  simply safe cells a social distancing sweater. All right, I said I go to your calls. Show
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:57.200]  them show them the Homeland Security video where you were taser bracelets. I'm not making
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:02.600]  this up, folks. I know I'm saying this stuff. It just sounds fantastic. I'm not lying.
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:08.480]  Is there a solution to hijacking? Yes, everyone will wear a shocking bracelet. Homeland Security
[1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:14.840]  says it's okay. Only if you're bad will the stirrer to shock you. Oh, I'm sorry. The flight
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:24.640]  attendant don't put me in a reeducation center. And I'll have these. Okay. I'm going to just
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:29.280]  say this and go to a call. It could be your last chance to get an info wars t shirt, a

[1:48:03.160 --> 1:48:07.840]  today's my last show to me like Joe said today was last show. But he was on the next day.
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:15.840]  I'm saying we're out of time. We're living on borrowed time. They're getting ready for
[1:48:15.840 --> 1:48:25.240]  some big event. We're in trouble. The establishments made a deal with the devil literally and figuratively
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:31.640]  and so don't lie to yourselves anymore. All the stupid crap don't matter anymore. Your
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:38.280]  eyelashes in your fingernail crap or your golf clubs. It's all a diversion from God
[1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:43.120]  and the devil and where you're going to be in eternity. All right. I'm shutting up John
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:47.960]  and DC marching DC city on lockdown. What will Trump do? Well, Trump's going to leave
[1:48:47.960 --> 1:48:54.760]  in 45 hours or whatever it is. Go ahead. That's right. Alex. I got the call from from the
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:59.960]  president to be here on January 6th and I'm still here. Well, God bless you, brother.
[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:05.480]  What do you see there? What's unfolding? I see a lot of a lot of buses, a lot of buses
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:13.560]  with the tentative windows and I'm hoping that there are troops, real troops, US soldiers.
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:20.400]  One thing that you're not mentioning at all is where's Trump? If he doesn't say something
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:26.200]  and start the insurrection act or something to slow this down, this will be worse than
[1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:27.200]  the Bay of Pigs.
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:33.680]  Brother, I hear you. That's what I'm saying is he surrounded. No one is supporting him.
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.000]  The cube movement was to make people think he was invincible. They set us up on the sixth
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:43.280]  to demonize us. And so Trump's going to have Trump's going to leave. I mean, that's what's
[1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:47.240]  going down here, brother. Those troops. But but here's the weird wrinkle. They're now
[1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:51.360]  saying the troops are terrorist. Fox News is saying and CNN is reporting they don't
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:54.880]  trust the troops either. So who knows what's going on up there? I mean, this is crazy,
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:49:56.760]  brother. We're about to find out, aren't we?
[1:49:56.760 --> 1:50:00.880]  We the people know what the truth is. We know there was election fraud. We know COVID is
[1:50:00.880 --> 1:50:06.640]  a hoax. We know there's a rampant pedophilia going on. We know Epstein didn't kill himself.
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:11.760]  We know we didn't send send help for the Benghazi soldiers. We know that Joe Biden's
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:18.760]  a senile. What in the heck? How can a man get on it on a plane and fly away from all
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:25.320]  of this? He also said he would never surrender. So I'm here in the belly of the beast, waiting
[1:50:25.320 --> 1:50:31.280]  for the command not to do violence. But the civil disobedience, all of it. They're acting
[1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:35.800]  like that's totally criminal saying no protesting allowed. Exactly. This is so evil. Well, brother,
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:39.640]  I appreciate your steadfastness. I heard the president's call as well. I love you. God's
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:43.280]  watching. That's all that matters. But what are you in 50 seconds left? What are you witnessing
[1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:50.480]  in DC? We have not yet begun the fight. What are you witnessing in DC? I'm witnessing a
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:56.720]  major lockdown. I'm right at the Capitol Skyline Hotel. I can see the Capitol and I can see
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:02.600]  the Washington Monument. I see a lot, like I say, a lot of buses, a lot of security check
[1:51:02.600 --> 1:51:07.720]  points and everything. I'm leaving this hotel tomorrow, taking my phone with me and I'll
[1:51:07.720 --> 1:51:13.480]  record everything. But Donald J. Trump has got to make a move. If he walks away from
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:17.840]  this, like I say, it'll be worse than the Bay of Pigs. We were hung out. I hear you,
[1:51:17.840 --> 1:51:22.720]  brother. God bless you. Here's what happened. Marshall Law. Let's get that guy's number.
[1:51:22.720 --> 1:51:26.960]  He's already gone. Marshall Law, I want to have him as another guest. Another great source
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:33.080]  in the DC. Marshall Law is put in place for the Chinese handover. The storm was the Chinese
[1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:38.080]  handover. Now you're seeing the storm. Then you'll see the mass arrest of the Patriots,
[1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:44.380]  probably. Our activated charcoal toothpaste became a bestseller overnight because activated
[1:51:44.380 --> 1:51:48.720]  charcoal is already one of the top selling fastest growing toothpaste out there. The problem
[1:51:48.720 --> 1:51:53.040]  is a lot of the other over the counter ones have aspartame as their flavoring, very, very
[1:51:53.040 --> 1:51:57.160]  toxic. And also they have fluoride in it. This does not have the fluoride. It doesn't have
[1:51:57.160 --> 1:52:02.160]  the additives. This is a concentrated, really is high quality. It's been sold out for months
[1:52:02.160 --> 1:52:06.480]  because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID Marshall Law garbage. But now
[1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:12.760]  it's back in stock. Info Wars, Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal toothpaste. Now back in

[1:52:40.840 --> 1:52:45.880]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would. They've always been part of the
[1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:50.240]  establishment and it's only going to get worse. If they're able to keep Trump from
[1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:55.320]  rightfully taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:53:00.000]  the hammer harder than ever on this Republic. They are going to explode gas prices. They're
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:03.440]  going to shut down our cold power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source
[1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:08.640]  to us. So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination.
[1:53:08.640 --> 1:53:13.040]  This is economic war. We're being consolidated. We're being taken over. The Democrats aren't
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:17.640]  mismanaging their blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control to
[1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:22.640]  bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:27.080]  all the infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the
[1:53:27.080 --> 1:53:32.160]  great reset is. Clow Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing
[1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:38.440]  is. So your business is only a 25% for several more years. No small businesses will be there.
[1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:40.080]  This is a master plan. Say no.
[1:53:40.080 --> 1:53:50.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:59.800]  President Trump has come out in just the last 24 hours and released the documents proving
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:04.240]  Communist China manipulated the election but still Trump won. So they said Trump had to
[1:54:04.240 --> 1:54:07.560]  go with no evidence of Russian collusion. They had the evidence of Chinese collusion.
[1:54:07.560 --> 1:54:13.520]  My God, China brags on their newspapers are trying to put Joe Biden in. Pelosi said that
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:18.080]  China wants Biden. So they're not even hiding any of this. So I get people are like, he's
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:22.160]  a Communist Chinese agent. They stole the election. It's illegitimate. The military's
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:28.280]  on our side. What's going on? The military takes orders from the globalists. And so Trump
[1:54:28.280 --> 1:54:32.160]  knows he's isolated. He's surrounded. He tried to have a big peaceful rally. Tried to get
[1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:35.560]  the Senate to have a 10-day hearing to show the fraud. He's never been able to show it.
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:41.640]  He had the evidence. And then they had Boogaloo's and others. Antifa raided the Capitol. A few
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:46.360]  Q people went in to be the useful idiots. And then now they demonize this. And Trump
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:52.040]  lost his support in D.C. So Trump's isolated. I'm not going to give you false hope, folks.
[1:54:52.040 --> 1:54:56.800]  I'm never going to lie to you. And it is my educated opinion that it's over for Trump
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:54:59.680]  and that we have to admit how much trouble America's in and that Biden's going to cut
[1:54:59.680 --> 1:55:02.760]  our energy off and so much more. And we'll talk about that. I want to go back to your
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:08.760]  phone calls. But this thing about Fox News and CNN, oh, the FBI is visiting the National
[1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:13.360]  Guard, the Army. They can't be trusted. They're with Trump. They're planning something. Well,
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:17.240]  that's all operation trust type stuff where they put out to the guys, oh, you're in a
[1:55:17.240 --> 1:55:21.080]  secret Q group. And now they can find it in your email and arrest you to act like, see,
[1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:27.040]  no one's trusted. That's how this works, folks. But I'll guarantee you there's not some secret
[1:55:27.040 --> 1:55:32.000]  military operation to save the country. That's not true. At the top, it's rotten. And you're
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:38.440]  going to see that. You're going to witness that in my opinion. So don't be part of any
[1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:43.040]  violence and he part of any secret group. Don't be set up, folks. Live to fight the
[1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:47.040]  info war another day. Houston in Delaware. Thanks for holding. I really appreciate it.
[1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:51.800]  Go ahead, Mr. Jones. Thank you for taking my call. You sound a little stressed today.
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:55.040]  So I wanted to bring you some comfort and remind you that they don't make taser bracelets
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:56:01.840]  and shot collars that'll fit us. Gorillas. That's right. I'm a I'm a prior service and
[1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:07.080]  Marine Corps. I was at the Capitol on the 6th. Um, we actually didn't get that. I mean,
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:12.040]  my wife and I were there. We didn't get to hear the end of, uh, president's speech because,
[1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:17.600]  uh, probably, uh, around the same time that the violence broke out or was about to break
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:23.720]  out. My wife turned to me and we saw an individual in black block trench coat. And ironically
[1:56:23.720 --> 1:56:29.960]  enough, we didn't notice his outfit so much as we noticed a, uh, uh, uh, an odor as he
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:35.120]  walked by, which calls me and my wife to both glance at him and see a firearm, not in a
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:41.720]  holster, not in, not in any, we, we both concealed carry where legal. Um, it was just tucked
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:46.320]  in a pocket hanging out of his pocket and both me and my wife shared a, uh, a look.
[1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:50.040]  And we immediately left the speech started heading back to our vehicle, noticed the violence
[1:56:50.040 --> 1:56:56.200]  and left. So if, uh, if anything, to be an echo of, uh, of what's been said, that there's
[1:56:56.200 --> 1:57:02.040]  without a doubt the cat, the Patriots that were there were their peaceful. Uh, and, and
[1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:07.120]  we've been lied to about it, but I was, I was reading the Bible second Timothy three.
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:11.480]  I won't read the whole thing to you just about how people are going to be in the end times.
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:16.760]  And if it doesn't describe the, the delusion that's in the minds of folks today, how you
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:22.640]  cannot see the truth. Uh, and I want to thank you, your whole team, Mr. Shroyer, Mr. Smith
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:28.680]  for, uh, for spreading that truth. I've really only recently become politically awake, active
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:32.960]  seeing what's going on. Um, well, I'm going to come back to you. I'm going to go to break
[1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:37.400]  because what I know the Bible passage, you're about to read. I want people to hear this when
[1:57:37.400 --> 1:57:43.120]  we come back, brother. So don't hang up Houston, Delaware. And then Jason Jones is coming
[1:57:43.120 --> 1:57:45.720]  on, but he's a great guy. He'll be happy to take your phone calls. We'll do one more
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:48.600]  segment of calls and then we'll have Jason Jones on it. We'll take calls, take a little
[1:57:48.600 --> 1:57:53.280]  bit of Salente's time and continue. And again, I'm not a fake. I'm not one of these calculating
[1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:58.640]  psychos. So I do blow up. I do get mad. I try to control myself and I, I'm bad on the
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:05.000]  crew that they put up with me. Um, I'm just really pissed off because I mean, this is
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:09.040]  so real people, but we just, listen, you don't hurt the globalist going and attacking the
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:14.320]  Capitol. I know, you know, that are shooting a cop. We all know that. And believe me, all
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:18.520]  the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and the Bill Gates is are in bunkers right now. And they
[1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:22.400]  want to sit back and manipulate us. And that's what I hate is watching these guys think they're
[1:58:22.400 --> 1:58:27.120]  smarter than us when they're not really smarter than us. They're just evil. The average person
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:30.600]  doesn't think like them. And so that's why they're able to do this. I saw a lot of videos
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:35.360]  of patriots trying to stop auntie for breaking in, but it didn't work. The globalist hired
[1:58:35.360 --> 1:58:39.480]  a bunch of thugs and sent them in there under FBI control under Southern Poverty Law Center
[1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:51.520]  and ADL control. That's what we're facing. Get right with God. We're back in 60 seconds.
[1:58:51.520 --> 1:58:55.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts. I have looked
[1:58:55.400 --> 1:59:01.600]  at every facet of this. And now only days until the inauguration of the Chai Con agent,
[1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:05.080]  it's all coming into place. That's how they change the subject from election fraud. It's
[1:59:05.080 --> 1:59:09.520]  how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop. It's how they change the subject from
[1:59:09.520 --> 1:59:16.240]  Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order. And now use the already martial
[1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:21.900]  law in place for COVID-19. And that's what it is to then be expanded and become political
[1:59:21.900 --> 1:59:25.920]  and become permanent. They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked.
[1:59:25.920 --> 1:59:29.440]  They train and do what you're told for nine, 10 months as training wheels. And now they
[1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:35.200]  launch the storm. The storm is here. It's a globalist storm. There's not going to be
[1:59:35.200 --> 1:59:39.760]  martial law for Trump. There's to be martial law for the globalist. They're trying to set
[1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:44.800]  you up. Don't be involved in violence. Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover
[1:59:44.800 --> 2:00:04.480]  with information. That's how we beat these people with truth. From the front lines of
[2:00:04.480 --> 2:00:14.720]  the information war, it's Alex Jones. We have reporters on the ground in D.C. I'm your host
[2:00:14.720 --> 2:00:19.360]  Alex Jones. We're taking your phone calls. I really appreciate everybody holding. We
[2:00:19.360 --> 2:00:23.320]  have the left caught red handed stage in the attacks with Antifa and with the Boogaloo
[2:00:23.320 --> 2:00:27.640]  boys. They don't even try to hide it now. They're taking credit for it because I know
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:32.480]  the media will lie for them. It's so sick. It's like watching Al Qaeda stage chemical
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:36.720]  attacks in Syria and shoot videos bragging because they wanted to get funding from their
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:41.080]  Islamic groups. But then our media would say that Assad did it. It's not that Assad's a
[2:00:41.080 --> 2:00:45.400]  good guy. It's just that it's not true what we're being told. And it's the same story
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:49.400]  over and over again. This is the takedown of America. I mean, Biden says he's open to
[2:00:49.400 --> 2:00:54.440]  the borders for the caravans. He's cutting the gas industry, the oil industry off. He's
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:58.960]  not just going to shut down the coal power plants. I mean, folks, 60% of our power comes
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:03.680]  from coal. The rest from oil and gas. We're done. The lights are going off. They're going
[2:01:03.680 --> 2:01:10.040]  to downsize you into a coffin size apartment. This is so brutal. What they're doing, man.
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:14.160]  The media won't tell you. All right, let's go back to Houston and Delaware. Then I'll
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:18.480]  go to Christian and others. Houston, you were going to read a Bible passage about the Antichrist
[2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:24.560]  the end times. Go ahead and read it to us. Yes, sir. We got second chemistry three, but
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:29.720]  realize this that in the last day, difficult times will come for people will be lovers
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:33.520]  of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant slanderers, disobedient to parents and grateful
[2:01:33.520 --> 2:01:39.760]  and holy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips without self control. Brutal, haters
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:43.840]  of good, treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure. I don't want to read
[2:01:43.840 --> 2:01:48.960]  the whole thing. We go on always learning and never able to come to the truth. Verse
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:55.720]  7 says, I just see the delusion that folks have about what's going on and how the truth
[2:01:55.720 --> 2:02:01.880]  is being hidden to us. It's again, why I want to thank you and everyone at Info Wars. And
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:05.200]  I had a question for you today. If you got time, I want to respectfully, I know we got
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:11.400]  some dollars, but I was reading through the strategic relocation, not the plug, but wonderful
[2:02:11.400 --> 2:02:18.480]  read. And me and my wife are fortunate enough to have family in a red state who have some,
[2:02:18.480 --> 2:02:24.040]  we have some, some land, a place that our family can, can retreat to and sustain themselves.
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:29.840]  And my question to you is coming from a blue state, you know, in a populated area, we got
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:37.880]  a thousand people per square mile easy here. Is the time to go here? You know, we continue
[2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:44.200]  to question for those who 100% is, is, is, is downsize your life and have, and have cultural
[2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:48.080]  goodness with God. It's worth everything not to be part of the system. You must flee blue
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:52.400]  states and blue cities. They're designed to totally collapse and bring down the entire
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:56.080]  United States. God bless you, brother. I mean, if I could leave the infrastructure that I
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:03:00.440]  have here in Austin, I would leave here immediately. And it's in an okay area of Texas, but it's
[2:03:00.440 --> 2:03:05.080]  still, it's all doomed. It's all doomed. This will collapse later. They're meant to hurt
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:10.040]  everybody here first. But that's how it's working. Thank you so much. Christian in Idaho, Christian,
[2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:16.480]  you're on the air. Thanks for calling. Hello, Alex. Thank you. Yeah, Christian, former Marine
[2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:23.000]  0311. You know, I really hope that the people understand that this has been planned for
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:29.720]  a long time. In 1998, I was part of a training off in the Bay Area called Operation Urban
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:36.800]  Warrior, where they were trying to train the military to do these martial law lockdowns
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:44.880]  and take care of the citizens that way. So these are things that need to be understood,
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:50.680]  you know, and there was a lot of the same movements happening in DC when I was there
[2:03:50.680 --> 2:03:56.760]  that I was able to identify, you know, when I got, excuse me, I got attached with Matt
[2:03:56.760 --> 2:04:01.520]  Bracken and Phil to seal that whole day. And we were noticing all the exact same things
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:08.680]  happening. And it's something we need to be careful for because it's here. It is absolutely
[2:04:08.680 --> 2:04:15.200]  here now. You know, I was actually an Operation Urban Warrior. That was the I ever heard of
[2:04:15.200 --> 2:04:21.080]  you. We were on the roof at Oakville Hospital, and we were watching you through a spotter
[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:27.160]  scope like you're on the Berkeley Hill or the Oakland Hill. And some cops were harassing
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:32.040]  you. And that was the first time I ever learned about you. Well, I knew from Marines that
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:35.800]  blew the whistle that it was a takeover US cities gun confiscation drill. And then they
[2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:40.560]  basically admitted that on the video. Yeah, and that's exactly what it was. And at that
[2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:48.080]  time, they were utilizing robots that they are releasing now. I have photos from all
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:56.640]  the disposable cameras of the robot systems that they're releasing to the public now
[2:04:56.640 --> 2:05:02.640]  in operation. You know, it's all in my film, police state 2000. And as soon as I bring
[2:05:02.640 --> 2:05:06.360]  up the robots, the kernel flip cycles, you got to get out of here, Jones, because at
[2:05:06.360 --> 2:05:12.040]  first they let me in. And then they totally flipped out. Some liaison officer ran over
[2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:15.600]  named Jones. He wasn't military anymore. He's like, you got to get out of here, Jones.
[2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:20.720]  But yeah, I totally remember that. And then also later, I had some Navy SEALs come to
[2:05:20.720 --> 2:05:24.480]  Austin. They wanted to meet with me and they took me at the Access TV studio. They go,
[2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:28.520]  watch this, they put a VHS tape on. And it was a drone following me and my crew out of
[2:05:28.520 --> 2:05:33.080]  the hotel. And they used us as part of the exercise of how to track terrorists. And they
[2:05:33.080 --> 2:05:38.520]  only let us see them following our SUV and following us. And then, you know, took the
[2:05:38.520 --> 2:05:41.600]  VHS tape out of the machine, but just wanted to show me that. Isn't that crazy?
[2:05:41.600 --> 2:05:46.960]  Oh, it's not. And what people need to understand is when we did this operation, they had hired
[2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:52.280]  actors with FX kits, everything. They said, please, I'm an American, not the camp. Don't
[2:05:52.280 --> 2:05:54.680]  take my guns. I've got the video. It's in my film, police state.
[2:05:54.680 --> 2:05:59.120]  Yeah. And they're screaming the whole nine yards. The same thing has happened. And now
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:03.880]  in America, in the world, better understand, I heard Steve Quill say something very interesting
[2:06:03.880 --> 2:06:09.040]  on your show, where he said, we're getting ready to enter the Red Sea moment. And that's
[2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:13.000]  almost the moment I'm praying for, that God works a great miracle. But from everything
[2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:18.200]  I'm seeing, all the research I've done, we are getting ready to enter the Nezah Kenebra
[2:06:18.200 --> 2:06:23.600]  moment. We are now getting ready to have God's hedge of protection removed. And it is going
[2:06:23.600 --> 2:06:30.840]  to be up to the men of this country to stand up and do something. We must fight peacefully.
[2:06:30.840 --> 2:06:37.520]  We must do civil disobedience, but understand they are not going to stop. At some point,
[2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:38.840]  you need to become men again.
[2:06:38.840 --> 2:06:43.000]  Well, that's what's happening is the first is the awakening because they want us upfront
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:47.120]  for the public. It's going on to be violent. No, the legislatures organizing with leaders
[2:06:47.120 --> 2:06:50.880]  is whether going up for Ted Cruz and Josh Olly. They know they're real leaders. Yeah,
[2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:56.640]  this is California. This is Oakley. So this was hundreds of actors trained. Now that's
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:07:00.080]  skipping ahead to like Maine. No, no, go back, go back. This was being the intro of
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:04.200]  the film. But the point is I have like an hour of them saying, I'm sorry, where'd you
[2:07:04.200 --> 2:07:09.440]  get the gun? Well, I got it in San Francisco and like literally go door to door admitting
[2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:13.680]  gun confiscation drills. But you're saying you were there, Christian. Yeah, no, I was
[2:07:13.680 --> 2:07:17.800]  a part of the entire two week operation. And you guys had those big six wheeled armored
[2:07:17.800 --> 2:07:23.160]  vehicles. What are one of those called? Well, we had we had everything there. I'm not sure
[2:07:23.160 --> 2:07:30.720]  the parts you're in. We were we were directly in the Oak Knoll Hospital area off Seminole.
[2:07:30.720 --> 2:07:37.640]  But when we were doing the door to doors through Oakland, we were utilizing robots to go through
[2:07:37.640 --> 2:07:43.720]  the doors to all these robots were seeing now. They were there. I have the photos.
[2:07:43.720 --> 2:07:51.120]  Yeah, that was 21 22 years ago. Yeah, 1998. That's an affirmative. Operation Urban War
[2:07:51.120 --> 2:07:58.640]  your Bay Area. And then we caught them. The Marines aren't bad. It's the officers doing
[2:07:58.640 --> 2:08:03.320]  it. We caught them on the East Coast, doing drills where they get the local YMCA kids
[2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:08.920]  to go spy on their parents and report where the guns are in the small towns. Yeah, that's
[2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:14.160]  correct. You know, and it's it's just amazing because there was a lot of movements that
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:19.040]  I'm seeing in DC now that are the same thing, you know, and for our military, brothers and
[2:08:19.040 --> 2:08:25.760]  sisters out there understand that the highest ups are corrupt tyrants. Well, they're pedophiles
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:31.480]  in Oath. Yes, you've made an oath. You don't get in that club unless you screw little kids
[2:08:31.480 --> 2:08:35.760]  that you're damn right. You are damn right. You do bloodletting. You screw them. You use
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:40.600]  them up. And that's how you start making your bones with Satan. You know, and our military
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:44.320]  needs to understand they made that oath to defend the Constitution United States from
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:50.360]  all enemies, foreign and domestic. And we have domestic enemies and they will need to
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:57.960]  do something or they will be on the downside of the greatest takeover in the world's history.
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:03.440]  And they need to understand that. You know, this is this is not a game, you know, and
[2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:09.600]  even for a quick story, DC off of Virginia Avenue, we walk up, there's a man dead in
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:14.400]  the middle of the street on Virginia Avenue. There's five police officers standing around
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:20.280]  him doing nothing. So I run up there, you know, and I ask her, Hey, what's going on?
[2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:26.440]  Oh, he's dead. You're not doing CPR. Well, due to new COVID regulations, we don't have
[2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:33.840]  to perform CPR. And the family's there crying. So I finally had an officer throw me a one
[2:09:33.840 --> 2:09:41.280]  way valve mask, perform CPR for 25 minutes. The fire department finally shows up. It took
[2:09:41.280 --> 2:10:11.120]  the fire department five more minutes. God bless you, brother. It's a breakdown of society.
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:18.880]  Every month, we launch a new URL before they ban it. But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists
[2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:27.080]  are on our tail. But the new website is the resistance.video, the resistance.video. They're
[2:10:27.080 --> 2:10:32.880]  trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them. So the new URL that links
[2:10:32.880 --> 2:10:37.480]  right to banned out video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special
[2:10:37.480 --> 2:10:42.960]  reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video share the link,
[2:10:42.960 --> 2:10:48.920]  the resistance.video, the resistance.video. Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for
[2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:53.280]  holding. How are you doing, Alex? Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:58.200]  a critical time. Brother, how are you? I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that
[2:10:58.200 --> 2:11:03.640]  DNA force. I love it. I've been using it quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients
[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:09.840]  again the other day and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published
[2:11:09.840 --> 2:11:17.600]  studies that Dr. Merkula has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:22.800]  channel the zinc into the cells. So people might want to take a look at that. All I know
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:28.920]  is with DNA force, we went out and looked at these high end products that they sell through
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:32.760]  doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle
[2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:36.080]  because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:40.440]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:50.040]  this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[2:11:50.040 --> 2:12:03.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Yeah, here's our new single record from highway
[2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:29.720]  and I'm going to steal me a silver stallion with not a mark on it. Silky high, he can
[2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:37.640]  trust me like a brother. All right, Jason Jones is an army veteran, a patriot, a major film
[2:12:37.640 --> 2:12:41.920]  director. He's made international awards at huge hit films. He's also written the race
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:49.920]  to save our century. Jason Scott Jones and John Zamerick five core principles to promote
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:55.400]  peace, freedom and culture of liberty. He was there in DC. I saw him up there peacefully
[2:12:55.400 --> 2:12:59.520]  on the edge of the Capitol and we witnessed what unfolded that day over a million people
[2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:04.360]  there, a few hundred that went in, most of them peaceful. Some feds posing as they said
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:09.720]  Boogaloo's and Antifa was posing as patriots. I'm not saying all the Boogaloo's are bad,
[2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:14.080]  but I am saying it's obviously an accelerationist group that says they are with BLM. So I'm
[2:13:14.080 --> 2:13:17.280]  against anybody that's with BLM. I mean, I agree with Black Lives Matter. I don't agree
[2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:24.160]  with any of the nuclear family and all the black trans women are the most important thing
[2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:27.320]  in the world. I don't believe in chopping black men's balls off is the most important thing.
[2:13:27.320 --> 2:13:32.840]  But that's all a separate issue here. Mr. Jones, good to have you here with us. You've
[2:13:32.840 --> 2:13:36.480]  got the floor here for this little, this is a shorter segment, longer segment coming up.
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:39.480]  You've got the floor because I want to interrupt you to tell us what you witnessed, what you
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:45.640]  saw on your gut level about where this country is right now. 44 hours from Joe Biden being
[2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:50.600]  inaugurated the new communist imperial emperor. Well, first of all, Alex, it's a privilege
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:55.280]  to be on your show. And in these past couple of weeks, I have appreciated you and your
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:14:00.960]  team more than ever because you guys, your courage and your leadership has put you on
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:05.880]  the hot seat. So I want to thank you for being in the vanguard of liberty, the vanguard of
[2:14:05.880 --> 2:14:13.320]  freedom. And I told my friends that were with me at the March to Save America, remember
[2:14:13.320 --> 2:14:20.240]  what you saw with your own eyes. Remember it because the media will begin to get us to
[2:14:20.240 --> 2:14:26.120]  even doubt what we saw. And I have to tell you, Alex, that as somebody who was almost
[2:14:26.120 --> 2:14:32.080]  a never-trumper in 2016, came to really appreciate President Trump and his administration for
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:36.320]  their leadership and fighting for the Uyghur and the other communities I work with, vulnerable
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:40.920]  ethnic minorities that have suffered from our neoliberal foreign policy, as I became
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:46.240]  a part of his team, I really don't think I understood the MAGA movement or I didn't
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:52.520]  really understand who the deplorables were until that day. Because what I saw with my
[2:14:52.520 --> 2:14:57.040]  own eyes is I was a few rows behind you when the president was speaking and then we had
[2:14:57.040 --> 2:15:03.320]  to leave early to race to the stage that was never set up for us to speak. So as I was
[2:15:03.320 --> 2:15:08.760]  racing through the crowd, the very first thing I saw when I left the VIP area was hundreds
[2:15:08.760 --> 2:15:14.840]  and hundreds of Chinese activists standing up against the CCP. They were doing lion dancing,
[2:15:14.840 --> 2:15:22.680]  they had big drums, and there were Hong Kong flags, Taiwan flags, and it was a real festive
[2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:28.880]  environment. And as I looked towards the capital from the Washington Monument, I saw a sea
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:33.480]  of American flags, but I was struck by the flags of East Turkistan, the flags of Hong
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:37.680]  Kong. And I don't know if you saw this, Alex, but the Vietnamese community was there in
[2:15:37.680 --> 2:15:45.240]  course. I saw dozens of flags of the former South Vietnam. As we raced through the crowd
[2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:49.440]  trying to get to the Supreme Court, the parking lot between the capital and Supreme Court,
[2:15:49.440 --> 2:15:54.840]  where we thought the stage was going to be set up, again, just a very beautiful, and
[2:15:54.840 --> 2:16:00.920]  I hate using this word because it's a word of virtue signaling, but it just accurately
[2:16:00.920 --> 2:16:05.400]  says what was there. It was the most diverse crowd I had ever seen in my life. You would
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:11.600]  see the rainbow Trump flags, you would see Christian groups praying the rosary walking
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:19.600]  together. And as we went around the capital to go back, we already saw people up on the
[2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:26.880]  steps. And the steps to the backside, it was very peaceful. My concern was tear gas was
[2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:32.280]  coming, I guess, from the other side, and there was an elderly woman, and it was actually
[2:16:32.280 --> 2:16:39.080]  very dramatic when you're watching it, in a wheel, in a walk or climbing up the stairs,
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:43.400]  I guess, to take a selfie. And that's when I saw the look, you came around and I saw
[2:16:43.400 --> 2:16:50.680]  the look on your face, and you just had real concern, and you went up there, and you probably
[2:16:50.680 --> 2:16:55.800]  stopped on the side of the capital facing the Supreme Court. I don't know if it ever
[2:16:55.800 --> 2:17:00.040]  breached. There was no breach while we were there, and you got most of the people, you
[2:17:00.040 --> 2:17:05.680]  asked them to leave, and seas of people poured off the steps of the capital. It was very
[2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:13.720]  heroic, very brave. Then we were walking away. I went back up there, as everyone came off,
[2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:17.960]  I went back up there to see what was going on, and then your team called me back over
[2:17:17.960 --> 2:17:23.840]  to where you guys were, and then as we were walking away, someone had texted someone on
[2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:29.280]  your team a photo from inside the capital, and I believe it was you, or someone on your
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:34.480]  team said, oh, that's Photoshop. And I said, oh, thank God, that's a good answer, it was
[2:17:34.480 --> 2:17:40.480]  Photoshopped. Of course, we found out that it wasn't, but the reality is for 95% of the
[2:17:40.480 --> 2:17:45.360]  people that were there, and I don't know how to judge the size of these crowds, they didn't
[2:17:45.360 --> 2:17:51.840]  see any violence, they didn't see any property destruction. And then to the question of who
[2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:58.400]  was there, I've been involved with the Republican Party for 30 years, and many people could
[2:17:58.400 --> 2:18:03.640]  say, look, I've worked for the RNC, I've been maybe a part of what you call the swamp, and
[2:18:03.640 --> 2:18:09.920]  I didn't understand what was MAGA. That day I realized, what are all these rainbow Trump
[2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:14.120]  flags in the South Vietnamese community, and all these Cubans, and all these, what do they
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:21.880]  all have in common? One thing, it dawned on me. These were the folks that the neoliberal
[2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:26.720]  establishment that transcends both parties truly see as deplorable, as Hillary Clinton
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:31.720]  gave them that name, actually. And what she means by that is they don't deserve representation
[2:18:31.720 --> 2:18:36.840]  in Washington, D.C. We destroyed their countries and they emigrated here, their interests don't
[2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:44.040]  matter. You're gay and you're a conservative, shut up, deplatformed. You're black and conservative,
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:48.400]  we can call you any name in the book and abuse you on all social media platforms, you don't
[2:18:48.400 --> 2:18:55.960]  matter. You're a Uyghur, and Apple uses your family to make the products go away, you can't
[2:18:55.960 --> 2:19:01.080]  share those articles on Facebook. President Trump and the Trump administration fought
[2:19:01.080 --> 2:19:07.320]  for them, and that's what that group had in common. And the media will never tell the
[2:19:07.320 --> 2:19:11.160]  truth about the people that were there, but I said to my friends who were with me, it's
[2:19:11.160 --> 2:19:16.360]  going to be a scary time, and it is going to be dangerous to stand with these folks,
[2:19:16.360 --> 2:19:20.800]  but we must stand with these folks. We must stand with these people that no one has wanted
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:27.880]  to represent. And now they're trying to paint with broad brushes. As you and your team have
[2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:34.160]  as a reporter, I've gone to Antifa events and I've seen a lot of violence and arson
[2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:42.320]  and serious crimes, and those are called peaceful protests. This event where well over 95% of
[2:19:42.320 --> 2:19:49.680]  those folks were peaceful and didn't even see any shenanigans from their perspective.
[2:19:49.680 --> 2:19:57.080]  The gaslighting to me was, the gaslighting by the media, and then this response to the
[2:19:57.080 --> 2:20:01.880]  gaslighting by our military and our government, it's one thing to tell a lie, it's another
[2:20:01.880 --> 2:20:08.240]  to seem like you believe your own lies. It was all quite horrifying, Alex, and it just
[2:20:08.240 --> 2:20:15.760]  convinced me that we have to double down on our commitment to freedom of speech, freedom
[2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:22.400]  of religion, re and fair elections. And, you know, we're not, we're not going anywhere.
[2:20:22.400 --> 2:20:32.160]  We're going to keep standing up. Oh, I thought Alex was still here. Um, I thought, okay,
[2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:49.480]  so yeah, I, uh, that, that's what I got. As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:57.640]  in vitality, energy and overall wellness. And that's why we made one of our most popular

[2:21:52.920 --> 2:21:58.400]  trust that the Soviets used in the 1920s to identify who their opposition was. That's
[2:21:58.400 --> 2:22:03.360]  when George Arwell wrote 1984 that was about a futuristic Stalinistic world government
[2:22:03.360 --> 2:22:09.160]  system. He talked about a manual Goldstein, who was the supposed leader of the resistance,
[2:22:09.160 --> 2:22:14.320]  but really worked for the controllers to be able to identify anyone that was a dissident.
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:19.520]  That's what's happening. So the storm of Q is real. It's a globalist martial law takeover
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:24.920]  of America. I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but you have been had. I was suspicious of
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:29.440]  it, knew what it was early on, but I didn't realize it was the main thrust. The main thrust,
[2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:34.760]  the globalist takeover is Operation Trust 2.0. We're covering it all live on the air

[2:23:47.640 --> 2:24:04.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:19.720]  All right, Jason Jones is our guest. When I told me this host of the segment, I, I meant
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:20.720]  it. I was listening on my headphones. I got a wireless headphones, earpiece, but I was
[2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:25.220]  assigning some documents and shoving a chicken feet in my mouth. I was taking a little five
[2:24:25.220 --> 2:24:29.320]  minute, six minute break. I'm like, I'm finishing up as I'm walking back to the desk. I'm listening
[2:24:29.320 --> 2:24:32.760]  to everybody saying like, I'm trying to get back to the desk. Like, Alex, are you there?
[2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:37.920]  Now Jason Jones is here. Great author, great filmmaker. And look, I want to be so clear
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:43.040]  here. Thank you for coming to DC on the six. Trump called for it. We're fighting for all.
[2:24:43.040 --> 2:24:47.720]  We wanted 10 days of investigation by the Senate, totally constitutional. The Democrats
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:51.120]  have done similar things before. Now they're trying to outlaw our speech, but they did
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:58.960]  have Antifa and groups saying they were proud boys, which I thought was more Antifa staging
[2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:02.840]  the attack. And then they got a few idiots from, from Q who were not violent. The woman
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:06.480]  wasn't violent. Q shaman wasn't violent. Other than she broke a window out. She didn't deserve
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:10.640]  to die. But you could see this coming a mile away. So I'm not mad at somebody that got
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:16.800]  into Q because Q covered a lot of real stuff. I'm not mad at anybody. I'm not saying if
[2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:21.800]  you're in the Boogaloo's that you yourself are a bad person. I'm saying this is a perfect
[2:25:21.800 --> 2:25:25.440]  cut out for the feds to come in and lead groups and do things. And a bunch of Boogaloo said
[2:25:25.440 --> 2:25:30.320]  they were in the Capitol and were part of this. I mean, you don't want that known. I mean,
[2:25:30.320 --> 2:25:34.720]  wow. So, so that's the reality. I'll go wherever the truth is. It doesn't matter to me. I'm
[2:25:34.720 --> 2:25:39.560]  like a heat seeking missile. That's just boom. I'm, I'm trapped in. I'm signed over to God
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:44.160]  literally. I have free will, but I've turned it over. I can't stop going towards the truth.
[2:25:44.160 --> 2:25:47.640]  And so you warned about Q and its esoteric nature and how with Christ, everything is
[2:25:47.640 --> 2:25:51.920]  out the open with the occult. It's hidden. And you're really worried about a term you're
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:57.240]  coining and I am to what happens when it all crashes in and Trump is gone a couple days
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:26:01.440]  and the delusion is over. Don't do something crazy. The globalist are hoping. Don't just
[2:26:01.440 --> 2:26:05.600]  understand that you were deceived, but not all the info. The less like, oh, Jones is
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:10.000]  attacking Q now. That means he doesn't believe there's child molesters. What about Jeffrey
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:13.840]  Epstein? We expose it all or he doesn't believe there's a new order. See, it's like Q then
[2:26:13.840 --> 2:26:18.480]  owned all that so that when Q lies about all these other things, these dates, it discredits
[2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:23.720]  it. You can see it. So the movement was exploding. Q came along to take control of it. But with
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:27.920]  intelligence ops, we now know that well known intelligence ops that I know personally flipped
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:32.160]  to Q at the end because they were controlled. General Flynn's a great guy. He just wanted
[2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:35.400]  to lead an army that was waiting there with Q, but he still didn't control it. He's a
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:39.360]  good guy. So Jason, go ahead and we'll take some calls at next segment. A little bit in
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:44.560]  the next hour, Joe Salante said on the 15 after, get into Q aside. This term you're
[2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:50.880]  calling. Yeah, you know, I have a great worry because people have such faith in Q. I've
[2:26:50.880 --> 2:26:54.760]  been startled at people in my life, people I love and know from I went to high school
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:26:59.360]  with college with served in the army. They're just I'm getting inundated with these texts
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:03.280]  and forwards that their source, they all have these sources. And I'll call them and I'll
[2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:07.920]  say, listen, you know, put put that aside for now. Please stop sharing this information.
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:13.160]  It's from an anonymous source. It's communicated in a way that's ambiguous and you can verify
[2:27:13.160 --> 2:27:19.200]  what they state. When you have an ambiguous statement from an anonymous source that cannot
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:25.160]  be verified, you can't support it or refute it. All that can lead to is infighting and
[2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:30.880]  mistrust. And then that's the structure, the very structure. It doesn't matter even
[2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:34.800]  the content of what they say. It doesn't matter what you say. When it's from an anonymous
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:42.280]  source, set in an ambiguous way that cannot be verified or refuted. The only thing you
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:48.360]  have then is argument. It is a satanic action. God's laws are out in the open in blaze and
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:54.440]  totally clear with Satan. It's all secretive. It's all esoteric. Right. And then they linked
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:59.960]  it to Trump. And so there are all of these folks who have rightly understood that they
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:05.760]  don't have representation in Washington, the big tech companies treat them like garbage.
[2:28:05.760 --> 2:28:10.240]  Then they place all of their hope in Trump through queue, not even Trump. And here's
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:16.800]  something I predict that they made a messiah out of Trump. And then what happens? We know
[2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:22.440]  this. They wave you in with palms, then they nail you to the cross. So I expect to see
[2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:28.520]  a turn against President Trump from queue for not being the messiah that they said he
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:32.920]  was. He's just a man. He's just a political, you know, he's just a man who ran for president
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:36.000]  who fought hard against overwhelming odds that we should celebrate and pray for and
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:41.200]  support him. That's right. So they waved them in with palms and I anticipate queue will
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:46.600]  then nail him to the cross. And I really try not even to follow it closely because you
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:53.280]  should never follow something you know is not true. You know, if it's anonymous, ambiguous
[2:28:53.280 --> 2:28:58.000]  and not verifiable, don't even look at it because all it can do is taint your mind.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:01.160]  Well, notice whatever you talk about or I talk about, I show them right here. Here's
[2:29:01.160 --> 2:29:04.840]  the person saying it. But notice the media say, Jones said he hates black people. They
[2:29:04.840 --> 2:29:08.520]  won't show the clip. This is a lie. Or Trump hates all Mexicans won't show the clip. This
[2:29:08.520 --> 2:29:14.160]  is a lie. It's the same tactic. They don't show you because they're lying. Yeah, they're
[2:29:14.160 --> 2:29:18.640]  lying and that's what's really been startling. Alex, I don't know about you. Maybe I am naive.
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:23.600]  I always assume that if you're a writer for a major news publication that you went to
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:28.380]  college, you became a journalist because you were interested in truth. What happened along
[2:29:28.380 --> 2:29:36.240]  the way that they flock like birds, you know, with overwhelming dishonesty. And that's
[2:29:36.240 --> 2:29:40.480]  what's shocking. I even got worried because I did three episodes on my podcast, the Jason
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:44.760]  Jones show on Q and I thought I hope I wasn't overly charitable because I try to be and
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:50.400]  I was I was kind and gentle and I asked a lot of questions, but it was clear, very clear
[2:29:50.400 --> 2:29:55.720]  that I was, you know, opposing Q. I just wanted to make sure they couldn't take a clip
[2:29:55.720 --> 2:30:00.640]  because that's what they do. And again, I completely understand we do have a problem
[2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:05.960]  in all of our institutions or public schools. I'm Catholic, the Catholic Church, Hollywood
[2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:11.840]  with sex abuse. We're not saying these things are not real. But there's one thing to say
[2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:16.520]  that there's a Hollywood has a pedophile problem, which it most definitely does. There was a
[2:30:16.520 --> 2:30:22.480]  great documentary several years ago, Open Secret that talks about it. Then to say somebody
[2:30:22.480 --> 2:30:27.280]  has a strange Instagram page and they're a well known liberal, then they call this person
[2:30:27.280 --> 2:30:34.200]  a pedophile. It creates an inquisition or a witch hunt about things that are not proven
[2:30:34.200 --> 2:30:39.440]  or don't even have evidence when all the pedophilias on TV, the pedophilias everywhere, the pedophilias
[2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:45.960]  at Drag Queen Storytime and all these Netflix shows, what are you looking for it in a gutter
[2:30:45.960 --> 2:30:52.080]  hole instead of when it's on television? Yeah, or ritualistic child sacrifice. We all
[2:30:52.080 --> 2:30:55.280]  have abortion clinics in our neighborhoods. You don't have to look very far for all of
[2:30:55.280 --> 2:30:56.280]  these things.
[2:30:56.280 --> 2:30:59.560]  And by the way, it turns out a lot of abortionists are Satanists, high priests, and they are
[2:30:59.560 --> 2:31:05.920]  doing rituals. Yeah, there was that abortionist several years ago in New Orleans, who was
[2:31:05.920 --> 2:31:09.200]  arrested for using the fat. It's not anyone. I don't even want to say there's another one
[2:31:09.200 --> 2:31:13.760]  in Kansas, a bunch of them. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's despicable. When you're doing late
[2:31:13.760 --> 2:31:16.800]  term abortions, particularly killing eight month old babies all day, you're satanic.
[2:31:16.800 --> 2:31:22.280]  I mean, there's no 100% but what you haven't seen like the doctors go, I like the babies
[2:31:22.280 --> 2:31:28.820]  that mine go by a, I don't want Jesus never Jesus. You see those videos? No, I did see
[2:31:28.820 --> 2:31:32.180]  the one at the hotel. That was very weird. I'll show them. They'll, they'll, they'll,
[2:31:32.180 --> 2:31:35.760]  they'll just go, how are you doing? I love Satan, the babies are mine. I'll find the
[2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:41.040]  videos. It's, it's crazy. No, Alex, I saw it with my own eyes and you saying it, it
[2:31:41.040 --> 2:31:45.960]  just even, even though I saw it, when you say it, it's like, Oh, that's crazy. But I,
[2:31:45.960 --> 2:31:49.880]  it's true. So there's enough true things out there that we can say. And the other thing
[2:31:49.880 --> 2:31:54.880]  is my other problem with Q is not just that it's Gnostic, but that it's Calumny. It's,
[2:31:54.880 --> 2:31:58.480]  it, you know, I was on a Q site after being on your show. I was talking to you and I did
[2:31:58.480 --> 2:32:02.280]  this and they said, they said I was signaling. I don't even know what I was doing, but I
[2:32:02.280 --> 2:32:07.640]  did that. And it's so strange where they'll, they'll, they'll, it makes everyone guilty,
[2:32:07.640 --> 2:32:11.480]  but themselves, which again, I grew up watching seven up commercials and they're like, Oh,
[2:32:11.480 --> 2:32:15.200]  delicious. I mean, that to me means it's delicious. I mean, in Italian, it means delicious.
[2:32:15.200 --> 2:32:20.080]  So no, no, no, my intense, what matters if I put my thumb and my index finger together,
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:24.120]  I'm not a Satanist judge of free by its truths as Christ said, but that guy, that's how the
[2:32:24.120 --> 2:32:28.280]  Pharisees will always work too. They did all these evil things, but they would nitpick
[2:32:28.280 --> 2:32:29.280]  everybody else.
[2:32:29.280 --> 2:32:34.400]  Yeah, no, and the cat, and that's exactly right. Alex. The one thing is like Calumny,
[2:32:34.400 --> 2:32:41.080]  you have been probably, you should write a book on maintaining inner peace because you
[2:32:41.080 --> 2:32:48.920]  have been, and your team, you have been the target of the worst types of Calumny calling,
[2:32:48.920 --> 2:32:52.800]  you know, race is big at the things that you have people you love that you don't want them
[2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:56.240]  to hear that because you love them and you don't want them to think that you think some
[2:32:56.240 --> 2:32:57.240]  way about them.
[2:32:57.240 --> 2:33:02.160]  I don't know how you can handle that really Calumny. So you know better than anyone saying
[2:33:02.160 --> 2:33:08.160]  something about someone that's not true is horrible. And it's sometimes we can get swept
[2:33:08.160 --> 2:33:12.560]  away in anger and politics and say something, but we need to be very disciplined and we
[2:33:12.560 --> 2:33:18.160]  cannot go around spreading gossip or sharing unsubstantiated rumors. And that's something
[2:33:18.160 --> 2:33:22.480]  else that we see in the cute community. And then, you know, my friends will say, I'm just
[2:33:22.480 --> 2:33:28.720]  sharing information. It's up for other people to decide. Well, Tom Hanks wasn't arrested.
[2:33:28.720 --> 2:33:32.520]  Hillary wasn't arrested. And it's bulls. So stay there. I want to come back and take calls
[2:33:32.520 --> 2:33:37.360]  with you from Jefferson and Preston and Izzy and Richard. We'd really appreciate them holding
[2:33:37.360 --> 2:33:42.520]  today from the DC March. They were all there with you and I. We appreciate them holding
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:47.880]  it. Three, two, one, here we go. It's back in stock. It's been sold out for over eight
[2:33:47.880 --> 2:33:51.560]  months. We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock. Let me tell
[2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:55.360]  you a real quick about it. But the power of quail egg concentrate pollen block acts differently.
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:33:58.440]  The traditional line of history means that it's clinically studied to alleviate seasonal
[2:33:58.440 --> 2:34:02.760]  distress symptoms by helping to clear sonic passages and eating respiratory function.
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:07.340]  It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't
[2:34:07.340 --> 2:34:14.640]  get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock. 25% off at infowarsstore.com pollen block again
[2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:18.760]  is available in this one minute ad. I don't have time to tell you all about it. But believe
[2:34:18.760 --> 2:34:23.120]  me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally. Unlike some of the stuff
[2:34:23.120 --> 2:34:27.920]  that's over the counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:32.720]  This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress
[2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:38.080]  and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us. You chew up the pills. They taste great.
[2:34:38.080 --> 2:34:43.320]  It's available again. Infowarsstore.com pollen block. Infowarsstore.com.
[2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:48.200]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute
[2:34:48.200 --> 2:34:53.120]  wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and global
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:56.760]  corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your
[2:34:56.760 --> 2:35:03.320]  skin. It's all now completely official part of the UN Great Reset of the Debo Scoop and
[2:35:03.320 --> 2:35:08.080]  Cloud Schwab. All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:12.760]  Foundation, all the rest of them, at 10 to 21, at 20 to 30, it's here. And only gets
[2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:18.040]  worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[2:35:18.040 --> 2:35:24.080]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil, and stopping
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:29.800]  abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not
[2:35:29.800 --> 2:35:36.160]  expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we are
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:41.160]  all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:51.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts. I have
[2:35:51.040 --> 2:35:56.520]  looked at every facet of this. And now, only days until the inauguration of the Chai-Kom
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:36:00.440]  agent, it's all coming into place. That's how they change the subject from election
[2:36:00.440 --> 2:36:04.240]  fraud. It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop. It's how they change the
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:11.720]  subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order and now use the already
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:16.440]  martial law in place for COVID-19. And that's what it is, to then be expanded and become
[2:36:16.440 --> 2:36:21.040]  political and become permanent. They train you to stay in your houses. They train you
[2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:24.880]  to be tracked. They train you to do what you're told for nine, ten months as training wheels
[2:36:24.880 --> 2:36:30.920]  and now they launch the storm. The storm is here. It's a globalist storm. There's not
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:35.000]  going to be martial law for Trump. There's to be martial law for the globalist. They're
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:40.080]  trying to set you up. Don't be involved in violence. Expose the New World Order and expose
[2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:44.760]  the takeover with information. That's how we beat these people, with truth.
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:50.040]  Decentive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:55.640]  with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[2:36:55.640 --> 2:37:01.920]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com. Studies have
[2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:07.880]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[2:37:07.880 --> 2:37:13.440]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:19.920]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:27.020]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[2:37:27.020 --> 2:37:33.160]  and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and
[2:37:33.160 --> 2:37:39.560]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:46.560]  a friend, family member or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:38:09.560 --> 2:38:16.560]  Want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide.
[2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:20.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:31.560]  No one was buying the election. No one was buying the fraud. And then a consortium of
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:39.560]  fraud. And Boogaloo's went into accelerate. I've got the Boogaloo's right here taking credit for it.
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:47.560]  I've had some people tell me in minority listeners, well, it's time for a war, really, led by Hugh
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:54.560]  Shaman taking selfies and people getting shot. Whatever bullets this was a joke. The government
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:38:58.560]  is the political system. We have to change it. Anyone that says we don't want any government
[2:38:58.560 --> 2:39:05.560]  to kill all the police, overthrow, they don't want to get rid of the police. They want to take it over.
[2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:10.560]  So yes, I'm identifying who I saw with my own eyeballs and who I went and later realized online with
[2:39:10.560 --> 2:39:16.560]  their own admissions was involved in this. Antifa launched the attacks. They were in charge.
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:23.560]  People claiming they were with the Boogaloo's. And then they got some cue people to follow
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:28.560]  them. And then I went and looked and saw all these people with the Boogaloo's saying they did it.
[2:39:28.560 --> 2:39:34.560]  They were there, tracked who they are. They're not even hiding it. So I just wonder, you know, why
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:40.560]  these guys are being protected? Because the FBI created a bunch of militias they controlled.
[2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:45.560]  I'm not against the militia. I believe in the Constitution. But that's a well-regulated local
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:51.560]  controlled civil defense. I don't want just random warlords running around saying they're the militia
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:56.560]  in mask storming, storming buildings. So if it isn't the Boogaloo's, I invite them on.
[2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:00.560]  One of the Boogaloo guys called my security guy that he met in Virginia that we actually had on
[2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:04.560]  the show when we were in D.C. saying how glorious it was. We had him on to give us a view.
[2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:10.560]  Then come on. I mean, I'm not a powerful enough like cue or a Boogaloo, but you know, I mean,
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:14.560]  if one of you people want to come on the show and debate this, I'd love to do it. But Jason Jones,
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:19.560]  I want to take a few calls from Jefferson, Preston, Izzy and Richard. But the term you're
[2:40:19.560 --> 2:40:26.560]  coining here, cue aside, yes, I'm really worried that some people, when Trump flies away on Air Force One,
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:32.560]  they're saying like 35 hours. They say he's going to leave pretty early in the morning to Mar-a-Lago.
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:36.560]  The Democrats are already trying to keep him from being in Mar-a-Lago. It's crazy.
[2:40:36.560 --> 2:40:41.560]  What do you expect the cue people to do when Joe Biden's sworn in?
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:45.560]  Well, I think this is where it just is a Christian. We need to make sure people have hope.
[2:40:45.560 --> 2:40:50.560]  I mean, you know, people, even at the rally, when the first stop is steel rally, I said,
[2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:55.560]  I have hope. Whatever happens, I have hope. Christians had hope at the collapse of the Weimar Republic.
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:41:00.560]  Christians had hope in Bolshevik, Russia. The collapse of Rome.
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:06.560]  The collapse of Rome. We are still, even though they're these dark clouds, we are still in a better position
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:12.560]  than most Christians in the history of humanity. So why would I lose my hope?
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:19.560]  So we need to be a strong voice of hope. There was a woman who was at the Fluor Private Jet to the Capitol.
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:25.560]  My wife said she saw her on a news program today where she said that she's done with politics,
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:31.560]  that the government's controlled by pedophile groups, and so she's never going to vote again and she's done.
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:37.560]  And that's my fear. That's a mild reaction. You know, she's just done with politics.
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:44.560]  I'm afraid some are just going to really despair. And so that's where we need to be just a strong voice
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:49.560]  of hope and say that we know my daughter always quotes Frodo from Lord of the Rings.
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:53.560]  We saved the Shire, but not for us. We're on the long walk to Mordor.
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:58.560]  Our responsibility is to leave this country better than we found it for our posterity,
[2:41:58.560 --> 2:42:04.560]  regardless of the odds before us, and go forward, you know, daily, happily.
[2:42:04.560 --> 2:42:08.560]  But isn't it the Shire that matters? Because we're going to die, but the Shire goes on.
[2:42:08.560 --> 2:42:13.560]  Our communities go on. That really is all that matters. In fact, that's not selfless to die for your people.
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:17.560]  You should selflessly do that because you came out of those people and others will come out of you.
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:19.560]  This is the community.
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:25.560]  Yes, that's right. I think a lot of the Q impulse is a lack of fortitude.
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:30.560]  They hope that there's a secret team of patriots that has a plan that's getting everything done for them.
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:36.560]  That's reassuring. What's not reassuring is we live in a dark and chaotic time,
[2:42:36.560 --> 2:42:42.560]  like most times in human history. In most places and most times are dark and confused and chaotic,
[2:42:42.560 --> 2:42:46.560]  and we have to sail our little boats across these raging seas.
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:52.560]  And sometimes the sun is out and it's calm, and sometimes a storm is raging.
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:55.560]  Well, that's right. I don't want to apologize, but to be honest with the audience,
[2:42:55.560 --> 2:42:59.560]  I got very negative earlier in the show, but only people to wake up because there's a balance.
[2:42:59.560 --> 2:43:03.560]  I want hope, but that was you said, but admit how bad it is to make it better.
[2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:07.560]  Because other people need to hear how bad it is to finally, they're not even worried about hope.
[2:43:07.560 --> 2:43:10.560]  They just think everything's okay, and it's those folks I'm worried about.
[2:43:10.560 --> 2:43:16.560]  Yeah, no, you got to look at nightmare in the face to tame it, and we can't hide from it.
[2:43:16.560 --> 2:43:22.560]  We have to look what we're facing, you know, abortion. Today, Joe Shidler passed away.
[2:43:22.560 --> 2:43:23.560]  I don't know if you heard.
[2:43:23.560 --> 2:43:29.560]  A great hero of the pro-life movement, really the godfather, founding father of the pro-life movement.
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:36.560]  And, you know, we have now abortion through all nine months in many states like New York for any reason.
[2:43:36.560 --> 2:43:43.560]  And we'll see a push for that. We see the CCP clamping down from Hong Kong to East Turkistan.
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:47.560]  So there we see famine right now in Ethiopia. There's a famine.
[2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:51.560]  I wish the mainstream media would cover these things, which they do not.
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:57.560]  So the ones that they label as hateful and bigots, we're the ones that are fighting for these people,
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:44:00.560]  donating to charities that are caring for these folks.
[2:44:00.560 --> 2:44:04.560]  And we just need to keep doing that. We need to double down, start close to home.
[2:44:04.560 --> 2:44:08.560]  I just got rid of all big tech. I'm doing what I call big techs it.
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:11.560]  I'm leaving. I'm getting away from big tech every way possible.
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:16.560]  I've already moved off of all my social media accounts.
[2:44:16.560 --> 2:44:24.560]  And what I want to do is now become very intentional in how I communicate and very intentional in how I do my work.
[2:44:24.560 --> 2:44:27.560]  That's right. We think use those big platforms that gives them the power.
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:32.560]  We take our art somewhere. You build it. They will come. You have to then start making it about the speciality.
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:35.560]  And that's what they want to cut off. Big tech wants to cut off in person, don't they?
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:41.560]  Because there's that communal experience where you all see the same film or hear the same orchestra or hear the same pastor.
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:46.560]  Or you all see the same event. They want it because our souls touch each other much closer than we have.
[2:44:46.560 --> 2:44:51.560]  Really, it's not esoteric. It's a psychic spiritual event that they want to cut off.
[2:44:51.560 --> 2:44:55.560]  Yeah, and that's what we need to do. Let's read it together. Our communities.
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:45:02.560]  Let's be intentional. I made up a list of my wife, my kids, my grandkids, the godparents to my children, my siblings.
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:09.560]  And I made a chart and said, you know, I've been so pulled into social media for a decade or more now
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:16.560]  that it's made me lazy and lacking intent in how I build relationships with the people I'm most responsible to.
[2:45:16.560 --> 2:45:19.560]  And I think so we should all reassess.
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:23.560]  Exactly. It cheapens it all. Let's take some calls. You can make a summation on that.
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:26.560]  That's a great idea. I want to have you back on. Jason Jones is talking about it specifically.
[2:45:26.560 --> 2:45:29.560]  Thank you, Preston and Izzy and Richard and Jefferson. I don't want to abuse you guys.
[2:45:29.560 --> 2:45:32.560]  So if you've been holding over an hour and 20 minutes, I apologize.
[2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:35.560]  Izzy in Ohio, you're on the air with two Joneses. Go ahead.
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:42.560]  Alex. Hey, I was actually trying to catch up with you on the march down to the Capitol.
[2:45:42.560 --> 2:45:43.560]  Yes, sir.
[2:45:43.560 --> 2:45:50.560]  Yeah, you were long gone, but I know it's once I got down there, they shot that flare up into the sky by the inauguration stage.
[2:45:50.560 --> 2:45:51.560]  Did you see that?
[2:45:51.560 --> 2:45:53.560]  The red flare in an emergency. Yeah.
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:46:01.560]  Yeah. Well, then I saw like these people coming back and one guy, I stopped him and he said, I said, where are you going?
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:09.560]  He said, I just beat up three cops and they had a police baton sticking out of his, his hoodie had like a gray hoodie on.
[2:46:09.560 --> 2:46:17.560]  And then then I'm walking up further and this guy and this lady are walking out and she said she just got tear gas and I'm standing face to face with her and I didn't smell a thing.
[2:46:17.560 --> 2:46:21.560]  And I said, here, I say a backpack full of water. You need it.
[2:46:21.560 --> 2:46:25.560]  And they looked at me like I had 10 heads.
[2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:33.560]  And then then I get up and I'm right by the base of the scaffold on the left and I'm looking up and I'm like, man, this ain't grassroots.
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:37.560]  And then all of a sudden this group shoves me aside.
[2:46:37.560 --> 2:46:47.560]  And they were being led by a guy with a red leather Chigavara communist type hat on with like a little chains on it with a hammer and sickle.
[2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:51.560]  And they were making a beeline for that back door.
[2:46:51.560 --> 2:46:59.560]  Well, that's what I saw was a bunch of communists and a bunch of Boogaloo's and then the Boogaloo's went and bragged that they invaded and ran the whole thing.
[2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:02.560]  And now I guess, I guess their federal bosses don't want that set on air.
[2:47:02.560 --> 2:47:05.560]  But I mean, they can come on and debate that all day how they're allowed to do that.
[2:47:05.560 --> 2:47:07.560]  Everybody else gets arrested.
[2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:10.560]  The last thing we want to attack the capital, but see, I'm not an accelerationist.
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:11.560]  I'm a restorationist.
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:12.560]  I want a republic back.
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:13.560]  I want our country back.
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:15.560]  I want to move forward without all the Satanism.
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:22.560]  And I'm not here to win popularity contest with the globalist or the FBI or the Q people or the Boogaloo's or anybody.
[2:47:22.560 --> 2:47:26.560]  And that's what it comes down to.
[2:47:26.560 --> 2:47:31.560]  And then I'm saying in there, we're kind of pondering what we're going to do, you know, whether we're going to leave or not.
[2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:39.560]  And all of a sudden this guy walks up next to me and he's got a backpack and it looked like he had like some brass sticking out of the top of it.
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:42.560]  Like you just robbed some offices or something inside the capital.
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:46.560]  So me and my buddy, me and my partner, we just got the hell out of there.
[2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:47.560]  Well, brother, God bless you.
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:48.560]  You came for the right reason.
[2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:49.560]  It got hijacked by evil.
[2:47:49.560 --> 2:47:51.560]  All the other Trump events were peaceful.
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:53.560]  We got set up by a bunch of rabble.
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:47:54.560]  99% of people didn't go in.
[2:47:54.560 --> 2:47:55.560]  A few hundred went in.
[2:47:55.560 --> 2:47:57.560]  And we'll talk about that with Jason Jones.
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:47:58.560]  We come back.
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:47:59.560]  I want to play a few of these clips.
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:00.560]  You have 50 more minutes with Jason Jones.
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:02.560]  We're going to talk to Richard Preston and Jefferson.
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:04.560]  That'll be it for calls.
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:08.560]  We'll be right back with our number four, the Gerald Salinte at 20 after it takes over.
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:12.560]  Please don't forget, if you don't find this, we won't be here and we're up against the enemy.
[2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:13.560]  We want to stay on air.
[2:48:13.560 --> 2:48:14.560]  This platform for everybody.

[2:49:31.560 --> 2:49:36.560]  The Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[2:49:36.560 --> 2:49:38.560]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:42.560]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:46.560]  for a political or financial reason.
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:50.560]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[2:49:50.560 --> 2:49:53.560]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:56.560]  You see the headlines from CNN and you see news.
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:49:58.560]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:01.560]  COVID more devastating than they ever imagined.
[2:50:01.560 --> 2:50:05.560]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:08.560]  just eight months ago, within three months.
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:09.560]  Okay?
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:13.560]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:16.560]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:17.560]  These are real numbers.
[2:50:17.560 --> 2:50:18.560]  These are real facts.
[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:21.560]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses,
[2:50:21.560 --> 2:50:23.560]  never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[2:50:23.560 --> 2:50:26.560]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[2:50:26.560 --> 2:50:28.560]  You could stand up against it.
[2:50:28.560 --> 2:50:30.560]  This is slavery.
[2:50:30.560 --> 2:50:57.560]  It is not something you can pull up with and survive.
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:51:01.560]  You must all give our rights up because of the shocking footage you're about to see.
[2:51:01.560 --> 2:51:03.560]  Hey!
[2:51:03.560 --> 2:51:05.560]  Fucking hey, man.
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:06.560]  Glad to see you guys.
[2:51:06.560 --> 2:51:07.560]  You guys are fucking patriots.
[2:51:07.560 --> 2:51:08.560]  Look at this guy.
[2:51:08.560 --> 2:51:09.560]  He's got covered in blood.
[2:51:09.560 --> 2:51:10.560]  God bless you.
[2:51:10.560 --> 2:51:12.560]  Yes.
[2:51:12.560 --> 2:51:13.560]  You good, sir?
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:14.560]  Do you need medical attention?
[2:51:14.560 --> 2:51:15.560]  I'm good.
[2:51:15.560 --> 2:51:16.560]  Thank you.
[2:51:16.560 --> 2:51:17.560]  All right.
[2:51:17.560 --> 2:51:19.560]  I got shot in the face.
[2:51:19.560 --> 2:51:23.560]  I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic mullet.
[2:51:23.560 --> 2:51:26.560]  Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing?
[2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:27.560]  No.
[2:51:27.560 --> 2:51:28.560]  We will.
[2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:30.560]  I may make a show that I didn't suspect in the place.
[2:51:30.560 --> 2:51:31.560]  Okay.
[2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:35.560]  I just want to let you guys know this is like the safest place.
[2:51:35.560 --> 2:51:37.560]  So I get there was some people attacking cops.
[2:51:37.560 --> 2:51:38.560]  One guy crushed a cop in the door.
[2:51:38.560 --> 2:51:39.560]  It's all wrong.
[2:51:39.560 --> 2:51:40.560]  But I mean, I'm sorry.
[2:51:40.560 --> 2:51:43.560]  Chuck Schumer, Mr. Jones saying this was the as bad as Pearl Harbor.
[2:51:43.560 --> 2:51:48.560]  That is really a criminal level of exaggeration, I might be.
[2:51:48.560 --> 2:51:49.560]  Yeah.
[2:51:49.560 --> 2:51:54.560]  The gas and what's even more shocking than the Democrats taking to TV and telling lies
[2:51:54.560 --> 2:51:59.560]  is to see the military response to the lies, like they tell the lies.
[2:51:59.560 --> 2:52:01.560]  And then there's a response on Capitol Hill.
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:05.560]  That's enough trips to take a major country they got in DC.
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:06.560]  Yeah.
[2:52:06.560 --> 2:52:07.560]  No.
[2:52:07.560 --> 2:52:11.560]  And what scares me about that is, you know, as a boxer, you throw your jab out and someone
[2:52:11.560 --> 2:52:17.560]  over commits a defend against the jab, you make them available to a hook.
[2:52:17.560 --> 2:52:23.120]  You see that the gas lighting and the deception in the media and then this response, what message
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:30.120]  does this send to our enemies, to Russia, to China, Iran, that this kind of overreaction
[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:35.120]  to gas lighting is really unbelievable.
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:40.120]  And this would have been an overreaction to the occupation of part of Portland for a summer.
[2:52:40.120 --> 2:52:46.120]  You know, and again, the American people see the same clips over and over and over and
[2:52:46.120 --> 2:52:47.120]  over.
[2:52:47.120 --> 2:52:50.120]  I didn't see the side of the Capitol where the chaos happens.
[2:52:50.120 --> 2:52:51.120]  And I believe that you did.
[2:52:51.120 --> 2:52:53.120]  I didn't see that till I got to my hotel room.
[2:52:53.120 --> 2:52:56.120]  And it is, it is startling when you see those same clips over and over.
[2:52:56.120 --> 2:53:03.120]  But then even when you see this, this gentleman angel or whatever is the guy with the horns,
[2:53:03.120 --> 2:53:07.120]  you know, when you see how he walked in and the confusion.
[2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:12.120]  And I hate to say this because my heart goes out and I've gotten attacked for saying this,
[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:17.120]  but my heart goes out for those Capitol Hill police officers, especially the one that shot
[2:53:17.120 --> 2:53:20.120]  the woman and people get really offended me for saying that.
[2:53:20.120 --> 2:53:26.120]  I blame whoever is responsible for there being very little.
[2:53:26.120 --> 2:53:29.120]  Whoever they admit they were understaffed that day.
[2:53:29.120 --> 2:53:31.120]  People get a lot of people have gotten fired.
[2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:35.120]  So I don't think it should be controversial to say this was a policing and planning problem.
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:43.120]  And I wanted to, I have seen more police at local rock festivals than I saw at the Capitol.
[2:53:43.120 --> 2:53:44.120]  I totally agree.
[2:53:44.120 --> 2:53:45.120]  Let's jam in a call from Richard and Tennessee.
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:46.120]  Richard, go ahead.
[2:53:46.120 --> 2:53:47.120]  Thanks for holding.
[2:53:47.120 --> 2:53:49.120]  Hey, buddy, how you doing?
[2:53:49.120 --> 2:53:50.120]  Good.
[2:53:50.120 --> 2:53:51.120]  Go ahead.
[2:53:51.120 --> 2:53:52.120]  Hey, I love talking to you.
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:53.120]  We were there.
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:53:56.120]  There's just a couple of things I want to cover.
[2:53:56.120 --> 2:54:00.120]  At the first part of the speech, it was pretty secure area.
[2:54:00.120 --> 2:54:02.120]  Everything felt fairly normal.
[2:54:02.120 --> 2:54:04.120]  But there were even right down.
[2:54:04.120 --> 2:54:08.120]  I haven't heard anybody mention mentioned this, but like even the music they were playing,
[2:54:08.120 --> 2:54:13.120]  when we walked up, the loud music was they were playing the Titanic theme song and guys
[2:54:13.120 --> 2:54:15.120]  are just kind of giggling and laughing.
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:20.120]  But after that, it'd be like, you know, three or four Michael Jackson songs in a row or just
[2:54:20.120 --> 2:54:21.120]  different.
[2:54:21.120 --> 2:54:25.120]  It's not music for the people that were there, you know, but we all gathered afterward.
[2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:28.120]  We walked down K Street and everything.
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:32.120]  And I haven't heard a lot of people mention of just how big of a ghost town it was right
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:35.120]  down to there was no one.
[2:54:35.120 --> 2:54:39.120]  It was like, if you took I am legend movie and you filmed it, you took us all out of
[2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:40.120]  there.
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:41.120]  That's how it seems for blocks.
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:42.120]  There was no one.
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:47.120]  We were funneled down and you could start hearing some loud rap music and playing and
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:50.120]  we were forced to walk kind of through an area with BLM.
[2:54:50.120 --> 2:54:56.120]  So no police officers or anything before that, but they were lined behind them with just rows
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:01.120]  of police officers while they're yelling at old men, men that were with Keynes that could
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:06.120]  barely walk down through their column names, screaming, fitting.
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:08.120]  And then we just funneled through that and walked down the Capitol.
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:10.120]  I had my adult son with me.
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  And as we approached the Capitol, he's just like, you can't do this.
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:17.120]  You can't walk up here, you know, like this and just there was no one as the previous
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:18.120]  guy said.
[2:55:18.120 --> 2:55:19.120]  Don't hang up.
[2:55:19.120 --> 2:55:21.120]  One minute break for Stacey to join us.
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:22.120]  Richard, I want you to finish your story.
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:26.120]  Then President Jefferson, then a final comment from Mr. Jones.
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:28.120]  Jason Jones, the race to save our century.
[2:55:28.120 --> 2:55:29.120]  Great book.
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:33.120]  I've read it and we'll give you his website and more when we come back.
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:35.120]  Ours is info wars.com.
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:36.120]  Only way to get spread is word of mouth.
[2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:37.120]  Please do it.
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:44.120]  We'll be right back.
[2:55:44.120 --> 2:55:47.120]  Stay with us.
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:48.120]  Q is a Bolshevik operation.
[2:55:48.120 --> 2:55:55.120]  Q is a relaunch of operation trust that the Soviets used in the 1920s to identify who their
[2:55:55.120 --> 2:55:56.120]  opposition was.
[2:55:56.120 --> 2:56:01.120]  That's when George Arwell wrote 1984 that was about a futuristic, Stalinistic world
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:02.120]  government system.
[2:56:02.120 --> 2:56:07.120]  That was about a manual Goldstein, who was the supposed leader of the resistance, but
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:12.120]  really worked for the controllers to be able to identify anyone that was a dissident.
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:13.120]  That's what's happening.
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:15.120]  So the storm of Q is real.
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:18.120]  It's a globalist martial law takeover of America.
[2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:22.120]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but you have been had.
[2:56:22.120 --> 2:56:26.120]  I was suspicious of it, knew what it was early on, but did not realize it was the main thrust.
[2:56:26.120 --> 2:56:30.120]  The main thrust, the globalist takeover is operation trust 2.0.
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:34.120]  We're covering it all live on the air at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[2:56:34.120 --> 2:56:38.120]  We'll have reporters on the ground covering the inauguration of the Communist Chinese
[2:56:38.120 --> 2:56:39.120]  by Biden.
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:40.120]  The globalists are planting false flags.
[2:56:40.120 --> 2:57:02.120]  We pray we can stop them crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:12.120]  Thanks, Alex Jones.
[2:57:12.120 --> 2:57:14.120]  Kick them while they're up.
[2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:15.120]  Kick them while they're down.
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:18.120]  Jason Jones' book that I've read is exactly what's happening today.
[2:57:18.120 --> 2:57:21.120]  He wrote a few years ago, The Race That Saved, our center will have him back on sometime to
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:22.120]  talk about it.
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:24.120]  Taking some phone calls.
[2:57:24.120 --> 2:57:25.120]  Right now, I'm Alex Jones.
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:29.120]  Your host, Charles Salente, takes over in just a few minutes in the war room with almost
[2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:30.120]  Troyer.
[2:57:30.120 --> 2:57:35.120]  Richard, you were talking about all the police presence behind BLM and behind some of the
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:41.120]  folks, the close to million people for the Trump rally, and then you start marching towards
[2:57:41.120 --> 2:57:42.120]  Pennsylvania Avenue.
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:43.120]  I was the same.
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:49.120]  I was marching once, probably 100,000 had already started marching to the Capitol long
[2:57:49.120 --> 2:57:50.120]  before Trump finished.
[2:57:50.120 --> 2:57:55.120]  And I get out there and there's all these crowds and not one cop car, not one person,
[2:57:55.120 --> 2:57:56.120]  nothing.
[2:57:56.120 --> 2:57:57.120]  And I remember saying, this is weird.
[2:57:57.120 --> 2:57:59.120]  We got to hurry up and get to the Capitol.
[2:57:59.120 --> 2:58:00.120]  I had a bad feeling.
[2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:02.120]  So please finish up.
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:06.120]  There was just an area to it because we, I was waiting for my friend.
[2:58:06.120 --> 2:58:08.120]  He was interviewed by somebody there.
[2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:10.120]  And so we're a little bit, you know, back of the way.
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:14.120]  But yeah, there was just that eeriness to it that you felt like it just like if you took
[2:58:14.120 --> 2:58:16.120]  us out of there, there's no one.
[2:58:16.120 --> 2:58:18.120]  It's almost like the rats would flee.
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:20.120]  For blocked seats, there was no one.
[2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:22.120]  There wasn't anybody looking out a window.
[2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:24.120]  There wasn't anybody there.
[2:58:24.120 --> 2:58:30.120]  And then as we approached the Capitol down at the bottom of the hill and now just did
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:34.120]  I'll remember it forever, but there's guys standing on type of a podium.
[2:58:34.120 --> 2:58:35.120]  It's like a little atrium.
[2:58:35.120 --> 2:58:37.120]  One guy's dressed like Uncle Sam.
[2:58:37.120 --> 2:58:39.120]  The other one.
[2:58:39.120 --> 2:58:41.120]  Dress like Darth Vader.
[2:58:41.120 --> 2:58:42.120]  I kid you not.
[2:58:42.120 --> 2:58:43.120]  This is dark and light.
[2:58:43.120 --> 2:58:44.120]  This is good and evil.
[2:58:44.120 --> 2:58:45.120]  All of it.
[2:58:45.120 --> 2:58:49.120]  But he's got the green and Tifa helmet on with the rest in full Darth Vader outfit.
[2:58:49.120 --> 2:58:52.120]  And I have a video of it and he takes his hand.
[2:58:52.120 --> 2:58:54.120]  He turns up to the top of the Capitol.
[2:58:54.120 --> 2:58:58.120]  He's looking up and he takes his hand to his ear because he's got an earpiece then and
[2:58:58.120 --> 2:59:00.120]  they're communicated and the Uncle Sam character.
[2:59:00.120 --> 2:59:05.120]  He's got a full bullhorn and they're just trying to get people, you know, motivated
[2:59:05.120 --> 2:59:07.120]  and fired up and you've got a little old lady.
[2:59:07.120 --> 2:59:09.120]  You've got, I mean, I helped the guys.
[2:59:09.120 --> 2:59:11.120]  Well, we've had a lot of witnesses and I've heard the audio.
[2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:12.120]  They were saying attack.
[2:59:12.120 --> 2:59:15.120]  Alex Jones has attacked before I got there.
[2:59:15.120 --> 2:59:16.120]  This is yours.
[2:59:16.120 --> 2:59:17.120]  Take this.
[2:59:17.120 --> 2:59:18.120]  This is your building.
[2:59:18.120 --> 2:59:19.120]  This is yours.
[2:59:19.120 --> 2:59:20.120]  This is yours.
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:22.120]  And I said, just look, calm down.
[2:59:22.120 --> 2:59:23.120]  You know, like they just, but it was...
[2:59:23.120 --> 2:59:25.120]  And look, that whole sea of people for analysters can't see it.
[2:59:25.120 --> 2:59:29.120]  They were peaceful and a few 1000 climbed up on the thing.
[2:59:29.120 --> 2:59:34.120]  And then a few hundred went in and we need Trump to go on the offense and expose all that.
[2:59:34.120 --> 2:59:35.120]  I appreciate your call.
[2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:37.120]  Richard, thegranthofCu été.
[2:59:37.120 --> 2:59:38.120]  It's showtipsinfowar Those dot com.
[2:59:38.120 --> 2:59:39.120]  Please folks, it isn't important.
[2:59:39.120 --> 2:59:44.320]  Jason will take two more calls from president Jefferson the seven nearly left,
[2:59:44.320 --> 2:59:47.120]  but obviously that, I mean, I disagree this is a false flag.
[2:59:47.120 --> 2:59:53.960]  What can Trump do with 40-something hours left in office? He's declassifying. He's getting ready to pardon a bunch of people
[2:59:54.320 --> 2:59:57.680]  What else can President Trump do? I think he can make a statement about now
[2:59:57.680 --> 3:00:02.640]  We have evidence of this was leftist groups leading the attack and show where they've taken credit for it
[3:00:03.800 --> 3:00:06.520]  Yeah, I do think he needs to make one final statement
[3:00:07.320 --> 3:00:11.160]  That would be gracious and magnanimous and point to the future
[3:00:12.080 --> 3:00:16.080]  And yeah, we need to stand with those folks Alex. I shudder to think
[3:00:16.080 --> 3:00:23.520]  if I was one of the people in the middle of the crowd just moving forward with the sea of folks laughing and singing and
[3:00:23.640 --> 3:00:27.920]  They could have walked right up those steps into the Capitol and they find themselves on an FBI
[3:00:28.640 --> 3:00:34.160]  Website and that could have happened to anybody that was there and we need to stand with those people as well
[3:00:34.560 --> 3:00:36.560]  the president should stand with them and
[3:00:37.600 --> 3:00:44.200]  And but I think really I'm looking forward to seeing not only what the president is going to do in
[3:00:44.200 --> 3:00:45.840]  In the coming weeks
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:52.920]  But what are we going to do and I think the gaslighting the misinformation the draconian control of social media and big tech
[3:00:52.920 --> 3:00:54.600]  And thank God it's big tech
[3:00:54.600 --> 3:01:02.040]  I mean if it was big tech partnering with big government, you know, you couldn't unsubscribe from the Stasi or the KGB
[3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:05.760]  But we can we can close down our Google email accounts
[3:01:05.760 --> 3:01:06.240]  No, I agree
[3:01:06.240 --> 3:01:10.320]  But now they're teamed up with these Republican groups about the articles the Republicans are involved
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:14.800]  They're now going they're suing Google and Facebook to take more people off and now they're moving to other
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:16.920]  ISPs to remove everybody else to disagree with it
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:21.640]  So I agree with you that we should have done the exodus like Matt drudge before he did whatever he did
[3:01:22.120 --> 3:01:27.440]  Said you better leave big tech now. It's gonna be too late. Well, we've done this five years ago. It's sort of the exodus
[3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:29.440]  We wouldn't be in this position now
[3:01:30.400 --> 3:01:34.200]  Yeah, and if we don't do it now what position we've been in five years, it's challenging
[3:01:34.200 --> 3:01:39.320]  But I hope you know necessity is the mother of invention and in the past couple of weeks
[3:01:39.320 --> 3:01:41.320]  We've seen the necessity
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:48.320]  You know and and not only that why would I be on Facebook when or Twitter when all it's doing is dividing my own family and my own friends
[3:01:48.320 --> 3:01:51.160]  I'm watching best friends. Are you back and forth then?
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:01:59.560]  You can still create a very inexpensive cheap website and take photos of trees and your cats and your dogs or horseback riding or how you
[3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:05.680]  Cook food or whatever and there's lots of third-party sites that have you post video and and then talk about God in there
[3:02:05.680 --> 3:02:12.120]  Whatever it's a point. It's move it away from them decentralize the information build it and they will come Preston
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:16.040]  Thanks for holding from Oklahoma than Jefferson. They're our last caller. Thanks guys Preston. Go ahead
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:19.080]  Hey, Alex, thanks for having me on. Yes, sir
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:23.000]  Hey, I just wanted to share with you and the listeners the same story
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:26.400]  I've been telling all my friends is don't listen to the mainstream media
[3:02:26.800 --> 3:02:31.080]  Listen to the people who are on the ground that were there because there's ones that are gonna be telling the truth
[3:02:31.080 --> 3:02:35.600]  You know and like the first night I was there, which was the fifth
[3:02:35.600 --> 3:02:41.560]  I saw some dingy guys wearing like one or a mega hat one has just a
[3:02:42.600 --> 3:02:48.520]  Trump flag as a cake and one will have like a hockey stick as a flagpole and you could just tell there
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:51.000]  There's just something off and I was like man something
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:56.920]  Something just doesn't seem right about these people and then you know going into the six
[3:02:56.920 --> 3:03:02.400]  It was just the most beautiful thing I've ever seen hearing all those people
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:08.880]  Seeing in the national anthem together and hearing it echo throughout the city was just it was beautiful
[3:03:08.880 --> 3:03:14.400]  I wish every American could could experience that you know and then you have things like
[3:03:14.600 --> 3:03:18.000]  There's a 77 year old lady there who it was her birthday
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:22.620]  And she went there all by herself so that she could see the president speak before she died
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:24.880]  and she had a bag with
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:31.200]  snacks and emergency blankets and she was handing out snacks and emergency blankets to people who were cold and and
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:37.120]  You know it was it was it was stuff like that and then when we marched to the Capitol
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:41.360]  I saw this giant flag like flags you see up at
[3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:48.720]  carlots in big cities and there's probably 40 people carrying this flag and I marched with them all the way to the Capitol and
[3:03:48.720 --> 3:03:57.720]  I at one point I accidentally got underneath it and it was just kind of a cool thing because I watched them carry it up
[3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:00.840]  Sure, this is all fascinating and I apologize you had to hold so long
[3:04:00.840 --> 3:04:05.720]  We got a lot of breaks like regular radio. What what happened once you got there? What's your takeaway here? Well?
[3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:07.360]  so
[3:04:07.360 --> 3:04:11.760]  All that was beautiful, but then at the end of the day when it when we went on the lockdown
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:17.080]  It was like a weird dystopia feeling so it was like I saw two different futures
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:21.840]  I saw the future of freedom and exactly good loving people together a good president
[3:04:21.840 --> 3:04:26.920]  And then all of a sudden a few people ruin it and the martial laws declared and it was all a setup and so you saw
[3:04:27.360 --> 3:04:33.560]  Saw all of it right there. Yeah, you saw the jaws of darkness clothes on something beautiful and vibrant
[3:04:33.560 --> 3:04:34.440]  Yeah, yep
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:37.840]  And then in the evening, you know because you couldn't buy food all day ever everything was closed
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:42.920]  And so if you didn't have food there yourself, you're gonna go hungry and like after the
[3:04:42.920 --> 3:04:47.960]  The lockdown happened you couldn't go out of your hotel room and it's incredible
[3:04:47.960 --> 3:04:52.560]  Preston and now they want to make it worldwide real quick. Jefferson in Virginia on the air with Jason Jones. Go ahead
[3:04:53.520 --> 3:04:55.520]  Thank You mr. Jones. Good to talk to mr. Jones
[3:04:56.280 --> 3:04:58.280]  Go ahead brother. I believe
[3:04:58.880 --> 3:05:05.480]  President is going to put the country in continuity of government so that he denies the Biden Harris administration ascension
[3:05:05.520 --> 3:05:10.360]  By inauguration there will be no president on January 20th, and that's just fine with Trump
[3:05:10.360 --> 3:05:17.120]  Well, that's kind of what Pachinic was hinting at is there won't be any president and then there will have martial law
[3:05:17.120 --> 3:05:20.040]  How is that good? I mean who runs that who's in charge of that?
[3:05:20.520 --> 3:05:24.360]  Well, we've had continuity a government plan for this country since the nuclear age
[3:05:24.360 --> 3:05:29.040]  This shouldn't shock us now that this is a possibility. Yeah, we don't have a little Congress taken out
[3:05:30.320 --> 3:05:33.160]  To the me could you Congress will be Chuck E. Schumer in charge?
[3:05:33.880 --> 3:05:36.480]  No, they're all gonna be arrested under 18 code
[3:05:36.480 --> 3:05:40.160]  242 deprivation of rights under color law
[3:05:40.880 --> 3:05:42.880]  Jefferson, I want your name and number
[3:05:43.160 --> 3:05:47.520]  Call me on Wednesday. We're gonna be doing a long broadcast into the evening
[3:05:47.520 --> 3:05:52.600]  And we're just gonna merge all the shows and go to like midnight. We're gonna take thousands of calls if I can

[3:05:56.360 --> 3:05:58.360]  Jason Jones, please join us on Wednesday
[3:05:59.160 --> 3:06:00.360]  after
[3:06:00.360 --> 3:06:03.800]  I'll probably go commercial-free. I mean stations. We still have to fire the tones
[3:06:03.800 --> 3:06:06.920]  So they'll have their ads but people just hear it'll cut off and go
[3:06:06.920 --> 3:06:11.560]  I think I'm gonna go commercial-free for the inauguration. It's pretty historic on Wednesday

[3:08:45.720 --> 3:09:13.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente
[3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:18.720]  Hello
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:21.720]  Alex Jones show and
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:31.520]  Boy is it important? I should say girl too. I don't want to be boy girl. You say amen. You got to say a women and
[3:09:33.720 --> 3:09:35.720]  You know anyway
[3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:40.280]  This censorship is real and it's only going to worsen
[3:09:41.240 --> 3:09:44.240]  Actually, it was one of our top trends for 2018
[3:09:44.240 --> 3:09:49.320]  Censorship 2.0, you know, this is just the beginning of it and
[3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:52.960]  It's really important that everybody do all they can
[3:09:53.600 --> 3:09:56.200]  The support info was to keep the truth alive
[3:09:56.840 --> 3:10:01.040]  And of course, you know, we we ask you to subscribe to the trends journal as well
[3:10:01.440 --> 3:10:07.920]  There's no the magazine like it and we do everything we can to give you the truth and trends and
[3:10:07.920 --> 3:10:19.240]  What's going on today, you you look at the headlines from for example, the cartoon news network CNN
[3:10:19.240 --> 3:10:23.440]  And they have a thing about the riots and the cap and they show the video. I
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:30.080]  Mean, you know, these are really deadly riots and people would be coming with guns and bop-a-bop-a-bop-a-bop-a
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:33.120]  You know, I don't know the details behind it
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:38.040]  But I see a lot of cops opening up doors and a few of them letting people through
[3:10:39.320 --> 3:10:41.320]  So if this was
[3:10:41.920 --> 3:10:46.720]  Staged or there was something going on behind the scenes that let it happen
[3:10:47.840 --> 3:10:49.840]  You know, that's one thing
[3:10:49.840 --> 3:10:56.560]  But to see this kind of thing and there's the cop over there walking behind them, you know, where are all these guys?
[3:10:56.560 --> 3:10:59.240]  I mean you could break into the Capitol that easily
[3:10:59.240 --> 3:11:05.880]  So it's one of two things either it was planned to let it happen like this or
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:10.680]  It shows you the total incompetence of
[3:11:11.680 --> 3:11:13.680]  America's
[3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:16.760]  Military
[3:11:16.800 --> 3:11:18.800]  industrial complex
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:23.760]  How can I not let this thing happen and people walking in like that?
[3:11:23.760 --> 3:11:29.800]  There was no gun violence there five dead. They keep putting that number up. Okay. How did it happen? Who got killed?
[3:11:29.800 --> 3:11:36.800]  Oh, yeah, how about that poor woman whose brains were blown out by the cops and the other people had what natural things, you know
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:45.320]  Something heart disease or whatever that killed them and the one police officer that was killed and now we're hearing different stories on how he was killed
[3:11:47.280 --> 3:11:49.280]  That is not
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:51.800]  a riot
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:54.400]  a riot that takes over
[3:11:55.520 --> 3:11:57.320]  the Capitol
[3:11:57.320 --> 3:12:03.280]  That these people could have been walked in like this shows you the total incompetence of
[3:12:04.280 --> 3:12:06.280]  America America
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:15.440]  Is it military industrial complex that has robbed us of trillions upon trillions of
[3:12:16.200 --> 3:12:19.120]  countless tens of trillions of dollars
[3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:21.120]  to
[3:12:21.400 --> 3:12:30.000]  Build a military industrial complex and the cops tough cops is all dressed up in their military drag
[3:12:30.840 --> 3:12:33.440]  Yeah, it'll blow your brains out
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:37.200]  If you're not wearing a mask
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:44.800]  You're not socially distanced maybe that's still kill you for necks look at this
[3:12:44.800 --> 3:12:50.760]  America the land of the free how about the land of the freaks?
[3:12:51.640 --> 3:12:58.440]  The freaks that are destroying this nation. Oh, I like Pelosi. I'm so happy Biden's there
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:03.960]  I like me McConnell. Hey Lindsay. Did you come out of the closet yet? Graham?
[3:13:05.160 --> 3:13:07.440]  Look at the freak show

[3:13:21.720 --> 3:13:24.760]  Arrogant arrogant nobody

[3:13:34.360 --> 3:13:42.000]  What wolf this guy got cojones smaller than a mothball? What wolf?
[3:13:43.040 --> 3:13:46.280]  Nobody got Rachel Levine behind him to back him up
[3:13:47.400 --> 3:13:48.680]  America
[3:13:48.680 --> 3:13:53.480]  The land of the free being occupied by the military
[3:13:54.320 --> 3:13:55.720]  for the
[3:13:55.720 --> 3:14:06.600]  Operation of a guy has been sucking off the public kit for 47 years a warm monger not a war that that guy didn't like
[3:14:07.840 --> 3:14:09.840]  America's military industrial complex
[3:14:11.040 --> 3:14:12.440]  There he is

[3:15:08.240 --> 3:15:09.840]  destroying the freedom
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:15.240]  The peace and justice of we the people of the United States just to get this straight

[3:15:45.120 --> 3:15:47.120]  willing to respect or
[3:15:47.840 --> 3:15:49.840]  accept behavior or opinions
[3:15:50.960 --> 3:15:52.960]  different from one's own
[3:15:53.840 --> 3:15:57.520]  Open to new ideas. What a joke
[3:15:58.200 --> 3:16:02.400]  They're libtards. I'm in libtard land New York, New York
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:08.040]  Yeah, this is from the toilet paper record
[3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:10.040]  Yesterday
[3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:19.360]  How Twitter coaxed its boss on Trump banned? Mr. Dorsey was concerned about the move
[3:16:19.600 --> 3:16:24.640]  Said two people with knowledge of the call for four years. He had
[3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:27.960]  resisted demands by liberals
[3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:34.440]  And others that Twitter terminate mr. Trump's account
[3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:37.520]  Look at that guy
[3:16:38.720 --> 3:16:40.720]  Liberals
[3:16:41.080 --> 3:16:50.640]  Liberals resisted demands by liberals. They are destroying the word liberal. Hey, who's this little jerk that wrote this?
[3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:54.320]  Oh, there's a couple of them, maybe. Oh, there are his Katie
[3:16:54.320 --> 3:16:59.240]  Conga Katie Conga and Mike Isaac. Hey, you jerks
[3:16:59.760 --> 3:17:05.320]  You misuse the word liberal moron toilet paper propaganda sheet
[3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:12.040]  Turlet paper record. That's all you're good for crabsters because liberals
[3:17:14.480 --> 3:17:19.520]  Are willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions different from one's own
[3:17:19.520 --> 3:17:26.440]  Haha, but not in the turlet paper. Look at this guy. Look at this guy. Dorsey. Look at the freak show. It's a freak show
[3:17:27.000 --> 3:17:29.000]  Welcome aboard 2020
[3:17:29.760 --> 3:17:31.760]  One who'd be right back
[3:17:32.080 --> 3:17:34.080]  a few I
[3:17:34.840 --> 3:17:39.440]  Want to warn all patriots in the United States and across the world listening to my voice
[3:17:39.440 --> 3:17:41.440]  I'm Alex Jones. I've been in this fight
[3:17:41.800 --> 3:17:45.160]  27 years and I've studied every angle of their operations
[3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:51.680]  And I'm here to tell you as clear as day. They have organizations on message boards and other groups
[3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:55.920]  Posing as patriot leaders and posing as president Trump
[3:17:56.480 --> 3:18:03.680]  Anonymously telling you to have arm marches in all 50 states coming up on the 20th and before that you are being set up
[3:18:03.680 --> 3:18:09.520]  I was there in DC with a million peaceful people and I watch Antifa and other leftist groups
[3:18:09.520 --> 3:18:14.720]  Poses our people and set us up. Thank God the Patriots did not engage in the rioting
[3:18:14.720 --> 3:18:18.720]  So only a few people did it. So the thing was a misfire
[3:18:18.720 --> 3:18:20.160]  It was a dud
[3:18:20.160 --> 3:18:27.360]  But the left is hungry to declare all Trump supporters terrorist and they're planning terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20
[3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:33.120]  To blame the American people. Do not be part of it. We are peaceful. We are not violent
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  We are peaceful
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  We are not violent
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:44.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts
[3:18:44.400 --> 3:18:51.040]  I have looked at every facet of this and now only days until the inauguration of the chai-kong agent
[3:18:51.120 --> 3:18:54.800]  It's all coming into place. That's how they change the subject from election fraud
[3:18:54.800 --> 3:18:57.200]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop
[3:18:57.200 --> 3:19:03.600]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order and
[3:19:03.600 --> 3:19:11.160]  Now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19 and that's what it is to then be expanded and become political
[3:19:11.160 --> 3:19:15.520]  And become permanent. They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:22.080]  They train do what you're told for nine ten months as training wheels and now they launched the storm the storm is here
[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:24.400]  It's a globalist storm
[3:19:24.400 --> 3:19:28.640]  There's not to be martial law for Trump. There's to be martial law for the globalist
[3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:35.600]  They're trying to set you up. Don't be involved in violence expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information
[3:19:35.600 --> 3:19:37.800]  That's how we beat these people with truth
[3:19:38.400 --> 3:19:40.400]  the post-industrial world
[3:19:40.800 --> 3:19:44.280]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:46.600]  Rio de Janeiro
[3:19:46.600 --> 3:19:49.440]  Agenda 21 conference back in 1992
[3:19:50.040 --> 3:19:52.040]  Now they've launched agenda
[3:19:52.200 --> 3:19:56.280]  2030 which is a post industrial world plows swap with the Davos group
[3:19:56.280 --> 3:20:03.000]  Trudeau the Prime Minister of Canada. They're all on record saying the great reset is agenda 2030
[3:20:03.320 --> 3:20:07.840]  Well, you might want to find out what agenda 2030 is it is the destruction of
[3:20:08.600 --> 3:20:14.400]  Society as we know it it is making the population poor by designs. We can be controlled with a medical
[3:20:15.480 --> 3:20:21.080]  Technocracy over you and your family. They're destroying civilization rebuild it in their dystopic
[3:20:21.720 --> 3:20:23.000]  image

[3:21:23.600 --> 3:21:25.600]  It's uptight all right

[3:22:09.560 --> 3:22:13.000]  Look what this country looks like militarized
[3:22:14.840 --> 3:22:21.680]  Again alex jones said it perfectly and I've been saying this for years. I'm the guy that launched occupy peace
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:24.040]  This has to be done peacefully
[3:22:25.080 --> 3:22:28.200]  You will not win a war in fighting it
[3:22:30.160 --> 3:22:33.600]  It'll be slaughter violence worth nothing
[3:22:33.600 --> 3:22:40.840]  America look at this. Oh, and I love those pictures. You want to show how?
[3:22:41.520 --> 3:22:46.720]  Stupid how what a bunch of losers the pentagon is
[3:22:48.440 --> 3:22:52.720]  When you had all those people laying around everywhere in the Capitol
[3:22:56.240 --> 3:22:59.040]  All dressed up in their military drag
[3:22:59.040 --> 3:23:04.960]  What kind of crap is this and I mentioned this because
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:13.160]  America starts wars all over the world. Hey, you remember that on the lying low-life piece of garbage
[3:23:13.160 --> 3:23:21.080]  Look at this. There's not as a there's a trained military for you. Look at this. It's a side show
[3:23:21.560 --> 3:23:25.560]  It's a freak show step right up step right up

[3:23:31.200 --> 3:23:34.760]  Just like they robbed us of our rights after 9 11
[3:23:35.960 --> 3:23:40.080]  They're doing it again. This is 9 11 on steroids
[3:23:41.320 --> 3:23:48.440]  This what's going on in America would be a reason for the slimy low lives like George W. Bush
[3:23:48.440 --> 3:23:52.360]  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and look at us. Look at us

[3:32:36.040 --> 3:32:42.040]  Q is a bolshevik operation
[3:32:42.760 --> 3:32:49.800]  Q is a relaunch of operation trust that the soviets used in the 1920s to identify who their opposition was
[3:32:50.040 --> 3:32:55.640]  That's what when george arwell wrote 1984 that was about a futuristic Stalinistic world government system
[3:32:55.880 --> 3:33:00.680]  He talked about a manual goldstein who was the supposed leader of the resistance
[3:33:00.680 --> 3:33:06.440]  But really worked for the controllers to be able to identify anyone that was a dissident. That's what's happening
[3:33:06.680 --> 3:33:11.880]  So the storm of q is real. It's a globalist martial law takeover of america

[3:37:21.080 --> 3:37:23.320]  And the story and i'm making it up
[3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:28.280]  From the toilet paper record last sunday this past sunday cued it yesterday
[3:37:28.840 --> 3:37:30.840]  How twitter coaxed his boss
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:37.480]  On trump band mr. Dorsey was concerned about the move said two people with knowledge of the call
[3:37:38.280 --> 3:37:41.880]  For four years. He had resisted demands from liberals
[3:37:41.880 --> 3:37:49.560]  That wanted to terminate mr. Trump's account they are not liberals
[3:37:50.520 --> 3:37:57.400]  This is this is propaganda and it's a destruction of the word liberal
[3:37:58.360 --> 3:38:00.360]  again
[3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:04.520]  Willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions
[3:38:05.320 --> 3:38:07.320]  different from one's own
[3:38:07.320 --> 3:38:14.680]  So little clown boys and girls who wrote the stupid story in the toilet paper record
[3:38:15.080 --> 3:38:18.280]  You misuse the word or maybe you didn't
[3:38:19.240 --> 3:38:21.240]  Your propagandists
[3:38:21.960 --> 3:38:23.960]  All right, what else they have on the liberal
[3:38:24.360 --> 3:38:26.360]  tolerant why
[3:38:26.440 --> 3:38:28.920]  A tolerant person wouldn't want to
[3:38:30.760 --> 3:38:32.520]  Get rid of trump
[3:38:32.520 --> 3:38:38.440]  Or an unprejudiced person or an unbigoted person or a broad minded person
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:44.360]  Why i find broad minded sexist how about the well we got to change that name
[3:38:45.400 --> 3:38:53.000]  Open minded enlightened for bearing permissive free free and easy easy going laissez faire libertarian
[3:38:54.600 --> 3:38:58.120]  Unbiased impartial non-partisan lenient
[3:38:58.760 --> 3:39:01.240]  lenient you got it lying little
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:03.240]  Territory paper freaks
[3:39:04.120 --> 3:39:07.080]  They're libtards not liberals
[3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:12.840]  Slimy little libtards. You don't believe in what I believe in you have no right to be free
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:20.600]  I'm one of the freaks walking around everywhere with nobody on the street with a mask on so beautifully designed
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:22.760]  So I can hide my
[3:39:23.320 --> 3:39:24.840]  face
[3:39:24.840 --> 3:39:26.840]  And not be anybody
[3:39:26.840 --> 3:39:28.840]  But looking to my eyes
[3:39:28.840 --> 3:39:30.840]  What do you see
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:32.840]  who
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:36.200]  Freaks libtards. There we go
[3:39:36.920 --> 3:39:43.560]  There we go in and out up and down inside out. I have a designer mask. Why I'm so cool
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:51.560]  I'm such a fool. Oh, yes, s.c. is doing great all those designer masks on the masked out freaks
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:40:00.120]  Lip cards why you don't wear a mask. Why how dare you come by me without your mask
[3:40:00.120 --> 3:40:01.720]  Hey
[3:40:01.720 --> 3:40:02.840]  Wanker
[3:40:02.840 --> 3:40:06.600]  You're wearing a mask. It's safe. Why tell me to wear one
[3:40:07.800 --> 3:40:11.000]  Oh, selenity. You're gonna die if you don't wear one. That's right
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:14.600]  All the libtards went after me when I held the rally up here in Kingston
[3:40:15.640 --> 3:40:17.640]  I had over 100s of people in the
[3:40:18.520 --> 3:40:19.960]  the garden
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:22.680]  The crown garden on the most historic four corners in america
[3:40:24.840 --> 3:40:27.000]  And I died that was july 4th
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:29.240]  Look at them. Look at the freaks
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:32.600]  July 4th. I died. This is not selenity
[3:40:33.080 --> 3:40:37.640]  Judge napolitano from foxes the keynote speaker that he died to we all died
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:40.200]  Everybody died
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:43.160]  Oh, and we all caught the virus and died
[3:40:44.040 --> 3:40:46.040]  from the virus
[3:40:46.840 --> 3:40:52.600]  So you're wearing a mask take your mask and shove it don't tell me what to do
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:59.640]  And any governor any president any mayor
[3:41:01.640 --> 3:41:03.240]  Any
[3:41:03.240 --> 3:41:05.240]  politician poly tick
[3:41:06.040 --> 3:41:09.160]  That wants to put a mask on me come over here and try to do it
[3:41:10.040 --> 3:41:11.720]  And vaccinate me
[3:41:11.720 --> 3:41:15.160]  You could take that vaccination and I'll just shove it where you want to put it
[3:41:15.720 --> 3:41:17.720]  And it ain't gonna be on me
[3:41:17.720 --> 3:41:22.920]  And I don't mean that in a violent way. I'll put it into your adam's apple
[3:41:23.320 --> 3:41:26.520]  So that when the virus comes in it'll stop right there
[3:41:30.360 --> 3:41:31.800]  Freedom
[3:41:31.800 --> 3:41:33.320]  What freedom?
[3:41:33.320 --> 3:41:35.320]  Freak dumb
[3:41:35.640 --> 3:41:37.640]  libtard america
[3:41:38.280 --> 3:41:46.200]  You don't believe what I believe. Hey, if you're being vaccinated jr. Shut up. You're shut up like crazy anyway
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:48.200]  You ain't alive man
[3:41:49.560 --> 3:41:51.400]  You're safe
[3:41:51.400 --> 3:41:55.080]  You're safe. So why tell me to get vaccinated?
[3:41:58.360 --> 3:41:59.320]  But
[3:41:59.320 --> 3:42:03.320]  You know, they're gonna do it. They're gonna keep pushing for it. And that's why you have to support info wars
[3:42:03.800 --> 3:42:05.560]  by their products and
[3:42:05.560 --> 3:42:12.600]  Subscribe to the trends journal. No other magazine like it. Puff another last week was about 92 pages this week a week before like
[3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:18.600]  110 no advertisements all facts helps you plan for the future and here's the future
[3:42:21.640 --> 3:42:24.760]  They're gonna keep pumping in more cheap money into the system
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:27.560]  It is the great reset
[3:42:27.720 --> 3:42:32.200]  They give the little people of slave land to you a couple of bucks. See you don't need to own your own business
[3:42:32.600 --> 3:42:34.600]  We gave it all to amazon
[3:42:35.400 --> 3:42:37.560]  We gave it all the target in walmart
[3:42:38.440 --> 3:42:40.680]  We made the billionaires billionaires bigas
[3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:42.680]  You don't need to open your own place
[3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:48.760]  Yeah, I owe nothing. It's the new world order
[3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:51.960]  You have no privacy
[3:42:52.280 --> 3:42:57.800]  And life has never been better because we are giving you the people of slave land
[3:42:57.960 --> 3:43:02.600]  Yeah, everything you need and we're just gonna keep printing all this fake money to make it happen
[3:43:05.160 --> 3:43:07.800]  So I remain bullish on gold
[3:43:07.800 --> 3:43:14.840]  Particularly silver. I see it rising at a higher percentage rate in gold this year
[3:43:15.960 --> 3:43:18.920]  I see it going well over $50 an ounce
[3:43:20.600 --> 3:43:25.000]  The silver makes it like $25 an ounce now in change
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:28.760]  I call the rise in silver when
[3:43:30.200 --> 3:43:33.800]  It was at $17 less summer
[3:43:33.800 --> 3:43:49.000]  And I called gold full run when gold was $1,332 on I believe it was June 6th, 2019
[3:43:51.000 --> 3:43:53.000]  In bitcoin
[3:43:53.160 --> 3:43:55.080]  Read the trends journal
[3:43:55.080 --> 3:44:02.040]  It was $8,000 several months ago. I saw in a break Soviet 10,000 solidifies. It's going to keep shooting higher
[3:44:02.040 --> 3:44:05.240]  And now we're right in the $35,000 rain
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:09.400]  So
[3:44:10.360 --> 3:44:13.960]  It's gonna keep going higher because they're printing all this fake money
[3:44:15.080 --> 3:44:17.080]  Back by nothing and printed on nothing
[3:44:17.720 --> 3:44:19.720]  And then they're gonna go digital
[3:44:19.960 --> 3:44:28.040]  So now with the military in full control in the USA and the United Soviet states of America
[3:44:28.040 --> 3:44:32.440]  They know every penny is spent where you spent it who you spent it on
[3:44:32.680 --> 3:44:38.520]  What where and when so they could get the money in taxes so all these little poly ticks
[3:44:39.160 --> 3:44:46.280]  These little slimy politicians who never worked a day in their lives. They don't have to worry because they got your money in taxes
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:50.920]  They keep their jobs their benefits their pensions and their salary
[3:44:50.920 --> 3:44:55.880]  So here we are
[3:44:56.440 --> 3:45:02.040]  Wining down and I want to thank Alex Jones everything that he's doing and the staff great staff
[3:45:02.680 --> 3:45:04.680]  Terrific people hard workers
[3:45:05.080 --> 3:45:11.400]  Do what you can to support info wars and most of all most of all be the best person that you can
[3:45:12.200 --> 3:45:14.200]  Rise to the highest level
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:16.200]  spiritually emotionally and physically
[3:45:16.200 --> 3:45:20.200]  Fight for freedom fight for peace and justice
