[00:42.580 --> 00:47.400]  is going to be jam-packed and extremely informative as we try to rally the
[00:47.400 --> 00:51.500]  population of the planet against the scientific dictatorship being set up with
[00:51.500 --> 00:56.180]  a private banking families that are known as the New World Order thank you
[00:56.180 --> 01:00.420]  so much again for joining us last week we had phone trouble for some reason with
[01:00.420 --> 01:06.900]  her and I want to interrogate her about Barack Obama as the from a quote
[01:06.900 --> 01:11.380]  progressive or liberal perspective Naomi Wolf who wrote the end of America and
[01:11.380 --> 01:17.220]  has been out there exposing the whole police state and fascism so Naomi Wolf
[01:17.220 --> 01:22.860]  coming up in T-minus 30 minutes Steve quail will be joining us he has a lot
[01:22.860 --> 01:27.820]  of military and police contacts he's been pretty accurate in the past when it
[01:27.820 --> 01:32.140]  comes to his police state predictions he's got a lot of amazing information
[01:32.140 --> 01:36.660]  he's gonna be joining us coming up after wolf leaves us and we've got Gerald
[01:36.660 --> 01:41.900]  Salente we were sitting there in the studio yesterday during a break we were
[01:41.900 --> 01:47.260]  ABC news I mean broadcast ABC we're watching a local news channel national
[01:47.260 --> 01:53.900]  ABC news there's Gerald Salente talking about banking collapses and rioting but
[01:53.900 --> 01:58.100]  they of course edited him down to about 20 seconds did let him explain that it
[01:58.100 --> 02:03.140]  was all being done by design so the system is definitely hyping breakdown
[02:03.140 --> 02:07.580]  they want that to happen by design I don't know how we can stop it but we'll
[02:07.580 --> 02:11.980]  talk more about that later with Gerald Salente in a full hour interview so it
[02:11.980 --> 02:17.980]  isn't just sound bites with him but then I got home and was checking clips on
[02:17.980 --> 02:23.020]  YouTube he was on CNN and Fox this weekend I mean it seems like whoever we
[02:23.020 --> 02:28.780]  have on his guest just just ends up all over Fox television except for myself
[02:28.780 --> 02:33.700]  and of course Peter Schiff's all over the place they ought to get his dad out of
[02:33.700 --> 02:39.060]  prison Erwin Schiff and he went to jail for writing a book about the IRS the
[02:39.060 --> 02:42.820]  judge said you write another you know you keep publishing that book about how
[02:42.820 --> 02:45.500]  we're a collection agency with a proper Federal Reserve I'll have you arrested
[02:45.500 --> 02:49.620]  he said I'm gonna publish it judge I remember when he had him on air before
[02:49.620 --> 02:52.900]  it all happened he said I don't care what they say I'm gonna do it they said
[02:52.900 --> 02:58.660]  you think you're loving a free country brother you're going to prison because
[02:58.660 --> 03:02.300]  this is the land of the slaves and home of the cowards not land of the free home
[03:02.300 --> 03:08.340]  of the brave speaking of that I mean nobody's really talking about this well
[03:08.340 --> 03:12.260]  some people are but they're not getting as upset as they should FBI and states
[03:12.260 --> 03:16.460]  vastly expand DNA databases FBI says they're increasing their collection
[03:16.460 --> 03:23.300]  yearly by 17 fold that's what the New York Times says and if you get detained
[03:23.300 --> 03:27.740]  at a roadside checkpoint they're gonna take your tissue swab out of your cheek
[03:27.740 --> 03:32.100]  that's some of the largest and most easy to scrape off cells England already does
[03:32.100 --> 03:36.820]  this Germany already does this and it's so they can make sure you're innocent
[03:36.820 --> 03:41.980]  uh-huh yeah right once they've got your cells folks well they do a lot of stuff
[03:41.980 --> 03:46.420]  they admit they sell it to biotech firms to develop bio weapons and biotech
[03:46.420 --> 03:52.180]  cures as well they can frame you with it the list goes on and on but I made the
[03:52.180 --> 03:55.700]  point on the Sunday show yesterday that what does this matter if you're 36 years
[03:55.700 --> 03:59.540]  older younger and live under global government control that's every Western
[03:59.540 --> 04:03.340]  nation now it's going worldwide your blood has been taken since birth for 36

[04:08.900 --> 04:13.620]  years ago Europe adopted in the last 20 years because it's a global government
[04:13.620 --> 04:18.740]  even has the same name collected the same way and finally it's mainstream news

[10:22.900 --> 10:26.100]  new developments with the nationalization of the banks not really
[10:26.100 --> 10:30.820]  nationalization but private banker takeover of other banks men bear the

[10:41.340 --> 10:45.660]  entire energy supply of the planet that's called tyranny energy tyranny they've
[10:45.660 --> 10:49.860]  really got this figured out they put scientists into the positions of
[10:49.860 --> 10:54.820]  figuring out new forms of tyranny also AP's reporting tons of released drugs
[10:54.820 --> 11:04.980]  taint US water supply 21 271 million pounds alone from drug makers versus
[11:04.980 --> 11:10.300]  other manufacturers it just gets into the unbelievable compounds in the water
[11:10.300 --> 11:15.300]  supply 271 million pounds of pharmaceuticals in the waterways that
[11:15.300 --> 11:18.820]  often provide drinking water contamination the federal government has
[11:18.820 --> 11:22.140]  consistently overlooked well of course they overlook anything that's really an
[11:22.140 --> 11:26.300]  environmental crisis how do you think they want to stop any of the real stuff
[11:26.300 --> 11:32.820]  that they're allowing to go on okay that's some of what's coming up today but
[11:32.820 --> 11:36.820]  as promised I want to take a lot of calls wolf's only on for 30 minutes
[11:36.820 --> 11:40.740]  with us because her phone kept screwing up last week and an hour interview we
[11:40.740 --> 11:45.300]  had set up so I just rescheduled it for 30 minutes today then we've got as I
[11:45.300 --> 11:49.580]  said Steve Coyle always informative and interesting always compelling and
[11:49.580 --> 11:55.300]  Gerald Salente coming up today but right now let's go to Chris in Kansas Chris
[11:55.300 --> 12:03.860]  you are on the air hello yes sir welcome hi I was just wondering not really sure
[12:03.860 --> 12:07.540]  what your personal beliefs are on the subject but I'm from a religious
[12:07.540 --> 12:14.140]  standpoint how do you see I guess the NWO in their goals in the tie-in to I
[12:14.140 --> 12:20.700]  guess the Bible and what it states in there well let me be clear most people
[12:20.700 --> 12:25.340]  never get anything done against evil because there are 20 plus thousand
[12:25.340 --> 12:29.820]  Christian subsects that all fight with each other everybody else everybody's
[12:29.820 --> 12:35.500]  going to hell but they're one group and so I don't ever try to get into all of
[12:35.500 --> 12:40.080]  that because if I did I would just spend all my time fighting with all the
[12:40.080 --> 12:44.980]  Pharisees and Sadducees that are the predominant Christian movement plus most
[12:44.980 --> 12:50.100]  the churches are on covert now public government payroll training their flocks
[12:50.100 --> 12:53.260]  to stand down to turn in their guns to go to the FEMA camps they're called
[12:53.260 --> 12:57.500]  clergy response teams at dovetails with the infraguard if you don't know what
[12:57.500 --> 13:02.940]  this is folks Google it and you know all the other secret police and domestic
[13:02.940 --> 13:09.020]  CIA they're setting up now that said I personally am a Christian and have a
[13:09.020 --> 13:13.780]  personal relationship with the maker of the universe publicly known as Jesus
[13:13.780 --> 13:17.780]  Christ like they call Easter ish tar it's really Yahweh but they always try to
[13:17.780 --> 13:22.380]  superimpose their names over everything regardless I'm gonna fight evil that's
[13:22.380 --> 13:27.860]  my duty I'm gonna take action but I from a secular position cover the news and
[13:27.860 --> 13:33.180]  info and as an anthropologist as a sociologist as a historian a lay
[13:33.180 --> 13:39.780]  researcher the elite do worship Lucifer they do believe in blood sacrifice and
[13:39.780 --> 13:43.220]  they do openly stayed in hundreds of books and government publications and
[13:43.220 --> 13:48.460]  UN documents and State Department memorandums that they plan to kill 80 to
[13:48.460 --> 13:54.100]  99% they have a debate but 80s the low number 99% is the high number of
[13:54.100 --> 13:59.900]  humanity for Lucifer and that and your phone's bad I'm gonna let you go but
[13:59.900 --> 14:04.020]  atheists and people say oh I don't believe in the devil well that matter if
[14:04.020 --> 14:07.660]  you believe in the devil or not there are people who rule the planet who believe
[14:07.660 --> 14:12.420]  in the devil and so even if you don't believe in an entity you know whatever
[14:12.420 --> 14:16.900]  you want to call it as if you know it's going on in the universe you know some
[14:16.900 --> 14:21.500]  type of entity from deep space whatever it is even if you don't believe in that
[14:21.500 --> 14:26.700]  an interdimensional being whatever there are humans who believe in it and who
[14:26.700 --> 14:33.460]  are manifesting it you got that Mac it's real one way or the other
[14:33.460 --> 14:40.620]  period Satan is real period period end of story and it's manifesting now what
[14:40.620 --> 14:43.740]  are you gonna do about it you're gonna stick your thumb in your mouth and
[14:43.740 --> 14:47.580]  you're gonna watch the TV evangelist and you're gonna let your kids drink
[14:47.580 --> 14:51.660]  sodium fluoride or you can wake up and fight it and break your conditioning it
[14:51.660 --> 14:56.100]  is literally a spell people are under I you know I was a kid I'd laugh at you
[14:56.100 --> 14:59.980]  know reading history books and things about the Romans the Babylonians the
[14:59.980 --> 15:05.260]  Aztecs the Mayans others doing quote spells on the public but then you
[15:05.260 --> 15:08.140]  research it'd be a big throng of people there in the village with the witch
[15:08.140 --> 15:13.220]  doctor talking in a chanting voice mesmerizing them hypnotizing them
[15:13.220 --> 15:17.780]  throwing some gunpowder or whatever in the fire and with some colors and you
[15:17.780 --> 15:23.740]  know big poofs of blue they were hypnotizing people that's all government
[15:23.740 --> 15:29.300]  does now and people are hypnotized by television the culture the drugs the
[15:29.300 --> 15:35.060]  stuff in the food or the drugs they're willingly on and they're hypnotized in
[15:35.060 --> 15:40.500]  the position to put up with anything stand up awaken take the blinders off I
[15:40.500 --> 15:47.740]  don't even ask you to believe what I believe but I want to do an analogy a
[15:47.740 --> 15:52.180]  YouTube video where I have a video camera up against a wall or maybe up against
[15:52.180 --> 15:58.300]  fabric on macro and you can see the weaving in and then back out and it's a
[15:58.300 --> 16:02.940]  curtain and then back out away from that and pull the curtain back and be
[16:02.940 --> 16:08.660]  shooting video out a window at a vista and say see the general public is right
[16:08.660 --> 16:13.340]  up against the curtain they can't see anything they don't know what's going on
[16:13.340 --> 16:18.540]  they think that's the whole universe and if you just pull the curtain back you'll
[16:18.540 --> 16:23.180]  be looking out an open window into a vista into a wider world does that mean
[16:23.180 --> 16:27.900]  the vista I'm seeing is everything no there's it's endless knowledge it's so
[16:27.900 --> 16:30.500]  exciting to be alive and the average person doesn't know that they they don't
[16:30.500 --> 16:37.540]  feel fulfilled we're on a planetoid orbiting a huge sun in deep space the
[16:37.540 --> 16:42.300]  stars around last night's gorgeous weather the birds are nesting its spring
[16:42.300 --> 16:48.700]  time it's like Valhalla in Austin Texas I want to be in mountain screams right
[16:48.700 --> 16:54.060]  now with the cypress trees you know wearing a mask and snorkel snorkeling
[16:54.060 --> 16:59.100]  around looking at big bass up underneath the tree roots and then going back to
[16:59.100 --> 17:05.540]  a little fire and camping out and hiking up mountain sides but no I am here
[17:05.540 --> 17:09.940]  fighting the New World Order and I enjoy that as well because in my mind I'm in
[17:09.940 --> 17:15.540]  that mountain stream Scott Scott were you calling from today
[17:15.540 --> 17:21.380]  I don't know Alex welcome yes I'm I hate to I know you got a lot of news today I
[17:21.380 --> 17:25.300]  just hate to lump one up on there but I got a nice big juicy story for you that
[17:25.300 --> 17:29.780]  just looking at right now on the computer it's off of raw story and it's out
[17:29.780 --> 17:35.940]  of New York Times and they're saying that it Obama's economic advisor says
[17:35.940 --> 17:40.220]  that they can convert the loans from the 19 biggest banks no I'm not doc and not
[17:40.220 --> 17:45.140]  the third stock common stock so they're straight up gonna steal the money
[17:45.140 --> 17:48.340]  they're gonna convert it into common stock next month go bank up dope your
[17:48.340 --> 17:52.940]  stocks worth nothing so you don't get no money back well I know that's one of
[17:52.940 --> 17:56.860]  our top stories I mentioned it but didn't detail it you has to put conditions
[17:56.860 --> 18:00.540]  on tarp repayment so now they're saying oh you're not even allowed to pay the
[18:00.540 --> 18:04.500]  money back guess what we own you and he's already feel fired the head of GM
[18:04.500 --> 18:11.180]  yeah New York Times banks bailouts may convert to equity MSNBC reporting why
[18:11.180 --> 18:15.900]  don't you tell folks what that means where they're gonna convert it the the
[18:15.900 --> 18:20.660]  loans over into common stock that way when the when the company goes bankrupt
[18:20.660 --> 18:24.460]  in a few months like most of them are going to do all that common stock is
[18:24.460 --> 18:28.460]  worth zero so we don't get no money at all instead of it being alone so that in
[18:28.460 --> 18:31.820]  the bankruptcy court we could argue for our money and get part of the assets
[18:31.820 --> 18:36.140]  back for our loan it'll be in common stock where it's worth nothing and we
[18:36.140 --> 18:39.580]  that's right that's right they lied and said and I reported this in the in the
[18:39.580 --> 18:46.340]  Obama deception they lied and said from day one they said don't worry we're
[18:46.340 --> 18:50.780]  gonna make money off these loans wink wink in the trillions and trillions of
[18:50.780 --> 18:54.180]  dollars to the banks but I said look at the bill it says they never have to pay
[18:54.180 --> 18:57.740]  it back no one can be investigated no agency can look at them no government
[18:57.740 --> 19:01.420]  can look at them I said it's designed for fraud look at them in the past and I
[19:01.420 --> 19:05.060]  said look you know they claim they're getting a you know they're buying an
[19:05.060 --> 19:09.780]  a interest in here this is the private banks using the government to fund
[19:09.780 --> 19:13.300]  themselves not the government nationalizing them and I said if we're
[19:13.300 --> 19:15.620]  gonna give them all this money they need to be nationalized these are offshore
[19:15.620 --> 19:19.900]  banks though folks it's not gonna happen and then yes by making it common stock
[19:19.900 --> 19:26.820]  that means that they can now gamble with it out there they'll run it up at first
[19:26.820 --> 19:31.300]  the market's gonna probably go back up to 9,000 and then when they finally plunge
[19:31.300 --> 19:36.660]  it later this year next year then they'll would have swindled the American
[19:36.660 --> 19:41.900]  taxpayer you're absolutely right and they're converting that that that US
[19:41.900 --> 19:46.380]  taxpayer money out to the private interest now that own the stock so open
[19:46.380 --> 19:50.940]  absolute complete theft good point I'm glad you called anything else you want to

[25:11.140 --> 25:15.500]  totally behind everything that you see in the sky on what this one program
[25:15.500 --> 25:20.180]  which is probably those who just joined us AP headline Obama looks at climate
[25:20.180 --> 25:26.740]  engineering and then his science headed science advisor John Holdren told the
[25:26.740 --> 25:30.620]  AP they may have to spray the atmosphere to save us from global warming but all
[25:30.620 --> 25:35.020]  the studies show it actually creates global heating what they're doing and
[25:35.020 --> 25:39.540]  notice he is a big global warming advocates saying they have to geo
[25:39.540 --> 25:43.860]  engineer to save the earth that's their cover the meteorologist and others we've
[25:43.860 --> 25:48.900]  interviewed say the giant secret chemtrail spraying program that they're
[25:48.900 --> 25:53.340]  now kind of unveiling to the public that's a cover story saying it's for
[25:53.340 --> 25:57.780]  the environment they're actually manipulating the weather and causing a
[25:57.780 --> 26:02.340]  lot of the floods and droughts and things so they can say we're having global
[26:02.340 --> 26:07.300]  warming they're actually trying to heat the planet go ahead exactly I but I
[26:07.300 --> 26:10.740]  would like the listeners to you know not use the word chemtrails anymore

[26:16.220 --> 26:19.180]  have to to be able to get to get listeners who've been listening for
[26:19.180 --> 26:23.420]  years and know what we're talking about I mean it's the slang term but if we
[26:23.420 --> 26:27.060]  start talking about direct and semi-direct aerosol spray campaigns yeah

[26:30.020 --> 26:33.900]  their chemtrailing us I mean you've got a point maybe I should always introduce

[34:06.540 --> 34:10.740]  much a part of this fight against the new world order as you are in America and
[34:10.740 --> 34:15.860]  I'm telling as many people as I can about your show of it's it's it's really
[34:15.860 --> 34:20.340]  great what you're doing well we appreciate you you know it sounds like I
[34:20.340 --> 34:25.060]  recognize your voice or maybe it just sounds similar to one of the guys who
[34:25.060 --> 34:31.700]  was here with that Australian film crew are you one of those guys Daniel no I'm
[34:31.700 --> 34:35.740]  not no no oh there must be a big delay all the way to Australia that's why he
[34:35.740 --> 34:42.700]  pauses for a moment and we go back and forth on each other yeah Alex just
[34:42.700 --> 34:47.180]  wanted to ask you about one thing I got interested in studying the new world
[34:47.180 --> 34:51.620]  order when this New Zealand preacher came to Australia his name is Barry
[34:51.620 --> 34:57.580]  Smith and one thing one particular thing that I'd like to bring up is he
[34:57.580 --> 35:03.980]  told us back in the 1960s our Prime Minister Menzies he borrowed money off
[35:03.980 --> 35:10.700]  the IMF and in doing so signed up to some certain conditions just like any
[35:10.700 --> 35:15.140]  loan any mortgages always conditions apply one of those conditions was
[35:15.140 --> 35:21.340]  apparently that Australia would have to introduce a goods and services tax now
[35:21.340 --> 35:26.260]  as the evidence seems to show that every single country in this world that has
[35:26.260 --> 35:31.420]  borrowed money from the IMF now has introduced the goods and services tax
[35:31.420 --> 35:35.700]  against the will of the people the Australian people voted against it they
[35:35.700 --> 35:38.780]  voted against it but the government brought it in because they had to they
[35:38.780 --> 35:43.420]  had no other choice that well I absolutely that's why I don't want to know
[35:43.420 --> 35:50.660]  go ahead oh sorry yeah yeah I just want to know I mean this was back in the 60s
[35:50.660 --> 35:55.660]  for crying out loud with all the money that has been borrowed off the IMF of
[35:55.660 --> 36:00.700]  recently I'd like to know what kind of secret conditions as part of the loan
[36:00.700 --> 36:04.660]  conditions how governments are signing up to of course they don't they don't
[36:04.660 --> 36:08.380]  tell the people this they don't tell the conditions that they're signing up to I
[36:08.380 --> 36:12.620]  know that one of the conditions are a certain change they have to change
[36:12.620 --> 36:17.700]  certain things in the educational system the curriculum there's lots of what
[36:17.700 --> 36:21.340]  why does the IMF have to be dictating these kinds of conditions to our
[36:21.340 --> 36:25.380]  governments anyway I hear you and I appreciate your call let me comment on
[36:25.380 --> 36:30.180]  that yeah that's why the third world was laughing a few weeks ago with the G20
[36:30.180 --> 36:33.540]  meeting I've got another one coming up in a few days when they said we're going
[36:33.540 --> 36:37.300]  to take a trillion dollars and help the third world they were all laughing they
[36:37.300 --> 36:40.700]  know what that means it means loan a billion here a billion there a US taxpayer
[36:40.700 --> 36:45.060]  money European money the US contributes about half the IMF and World Bank
[36:45.060 --> 36:51.740]  actually about 60% last number I saw and then they take it to the country and
[36:51.740 --> 36:57.620]  give it to them about 25 30% interest but that interest is paid to private
[36:57.620 --> 37:11.900]  banks and so it is then paid to private banks and on top of that it's 100 and
[37:11.900 --> 37:16.620]  something I don't want to give a wrong number out I want to say it's 119
[37:16.620 --> 37:23.100]  conditions it got leaked in early 2002 when Joseph Stiglitz of course left the
[37:23.100 --> 37:26.780]  IMF World Bank it's reported that he may be the one that leaked it but he's
[37:26.780 --> 37:30.300]  denied that here on air regardless the IMF World Bank admitted those were their
[37:30.300 --> 37:34.740]  documents and oh yeah it's the country's got to be signed on to UNESCO
[37:34.740 --> 37:38.380]  United Nations Educational Cultural Organization that sets all of its
[37:38.380 --> 37:49.460]  parameters and policies so that's got to happen and it just controls every
[37:49.460 --> 37:53.580]  facet of your life they've it's come out they've got conditions where you've
[37:53.580 --> 37:56.580]  got to restrict the second amendment you've got to restrict the right to keep
[37:56.580 --> 38:01.380]  their arms and the UN has said this publicly in their unidire meeting July
[38:01.380 --> 38:07.140]  7th 2001 in New York they said we must ban the civilian ownership of firearms
[38:07.140 --> 38:11.980]  because that threatens the power monopoly of the state the legitimate
[38:11.980 --> 38:19.220]  power monopoly of the state as they say it as they call it so they loan fiat
[38:19.220 --> 38:23.660]  money to the third world countries and first world nations and then they
[38:23.660 --> 38:29.620]  basically overthrow the nation the the politicians take the payout take the
[38:29.620 --> 38:33.300]  fraud money they then retire on to global organizations and global
[38:33.300 --> 38:39.100]  corporations or global governmental operations and hand the nation over to
[38:39.100 --> 38:43.340]  the private banking system and now the global system the New World Order the
[38:43.340 --> 38:47.020]  private banking cartel is bankrupted every major nation on earth but a
[38:47.020 --> 38:51.300]  handful that they don't control and those are always countries you see being
[38:51.300 --> 38:56.740]  invaded and attacked and governments tend to be evil so it doesn't mean that
[38:56.740 --> 39:00.660]  the governments of the globalist are attacking are always good either so see
[39:00.660 --> 39:04.660]  that's how the globalist can try to morally say oh we're going into iraq or
[39:04.660 --> 39:09.060]  we're going into iran or we're going after libya we're going after sudan or
[39:09.060 --> 39:14.380]  we're going after indonesia because you know they're terrorist or they don't
[39:14.380 --> 39:18.580]  like women or they're mean to children are they there they're hurting the
[39:18.580 --> 39:22.940]  environment but if it's a fog that works with the globalist they can do
[39:22.940 --> 39:27.700]  whatever they want and then it's a okay and the globalist will defend them and
[39:27.700 --> 39:32.460]  able to try to get moral authority to attack the few quote rogue nations the
[39:32.460 --> 39:36.900]  bankers don't control and so there's kind of a mopping up exercise going on
[39:36.900 --> 39:44.980]  and then the globalist can turn purely to feeding on the population of the
[39:44.980 --> 40:00.340]  planet now this is just the way it works i mean this is mainline international
[40:00.340 --> 40:06.020]  finance this is mainline economics this is not even debated or denied this is
[40:06.020 --> 40:10.540]  an admitted fact in the real world and anybody living in a third world country
[40:10.540 --> 40:15.300]  who isn't literally homeless who's had any education knows the imf and world
[40:15.300 --> 40:20.380]  bank are the predatory arms of the private banking cartel whose consortium
[40:20.380 --> 40:33.980]  is bundled together in the system bundled together in the international bank of
[40:33.980 --> 40:38.740]  settlements and so we're openly going into world government we're openly
[40:38.740 --> 40:44.380]  going into tyranny and yes generally the agreements one of the first pieces of
[40:44.380 --> 40:47.980]  an agreement of a nation going into receivership the private fraudulent
[40:47.980 --> 40:51.940]  made-off bankers basically is a good way to describe on the ponzi scheme
[40:51.940 --> 40:57.660]  operators is that it be secret and that's what the north american union is
[40:57.660 --> 41:00.420]  is that created new political system where you don't have rights don't have
[41:00.420 --> 41:03.660]  liberties so that this so the establishment can say that it's
[41:03.660 --> 41:08.860]  legitimately taking your rights and freedoms away see when they set up a
[41:08.860 --> 41:12.620]  new system they get to rewrite the rules and then they'll have all these if you
[41:12.620 --> 41:16.020]  look at the un declaration of human rights or the spp declaration of rights
[41:16.020 --> 41:20.060]  it always says oh you have all these great liberties and freedoms until the
[41:20.060 --> 41:28.660]  last few sections like article 29 30 and 31 of the un charter and declaration of
[41:28.660 --> 41:34.140]  human rights it says you have no rights though if the un wants to revoke them kind
[41:34.140 --> 41:40.460]  of like the new lisbon treaty to expand e you control of what's left of
[41:40.460 --> 41:46.820]  sovereignty in once free Europe it says they're banning the death penalty but
[41:46.820 --> 41:50.340]  then when you read the subsection it says unless fearing rioting or break down
[41:50.340 --> 41:54.660]  of society or emergencies directed by the EU well the death penalty has been
[41:54.660 --> 42:01.020]  banned in Europe for decades in every nation every nation in Europe western
[42:01.020 --> 42:05.340]  Europe is banded so why would they need to pass a new law banning it because it
[42:05.340 --> 42:15.500]  doesn't ban it it legalizes it just like they say oh we're passing a bill so
[42:15.500 --> 42:21.700]  that you have rights so that your medical information is protected bush did
[42:21.700 --> 42:25.620]  it and Obama did it the stimulus package got rid of all privacy it's all
[42:25.620 --> 42:30.340]  conduited directly to the federal government any prescriptions I mean
[42:30.340 --> 42:42.140]  anything I medicine pain pills prescription Advil it doesn't matter
[42:42.140 --> 42:49.660]  everything you go get a prescription fungus medicine those right into the
[42:49.660 --> 42:54.580]  federal database total control out of the Patriot Act you buy a house you
[42:54.580 --> 42:59.140]  lease a house you buy a car you rent a car you get a hotel all goes right
[42:59.140 --> 43:03.540]  through those computers are wired in and you pay for it in new added hotel fees
[43:03.540 --> 43:08.980]  added plane fees added car fees all part of Patriot Act compliance you know
[43:08.980 --> 43:14.780]  these money boxes these little check cashing places around the country all
[43:14.780 --> 43:19.940]  goes right through the feds which themselves are in a standardized system
[43:19.940 --> 43:25.100]  under the OECD under the International Bank of Settlements which are openly
[43:25.100 --> 43:29.460]  announcing globally setting one tax rate globally setting the interest rates
[43:29.460 --> 43:34.700]  globally setting the currency values and the private bankers can manipulate the
[43:34.700 --> 43:38.540]  currency manipulate interest rates manipulate things even more however
[43:38.540 --> 43:50.380]  they want so that's how these people operate
[43:56.100 --> 44:08.020]  so that's why I'm dumbfounded because the corruption in our society is just we
[44:08.020 --> 44:14.420]  are totally and completely dominated and conquered by a bunch of Larry Summers
[44:14.420 --> 44:23.260]  and and and Madoff's we are totally and completely conquered by a bunch of
[44:23.260 --> 44:30.140]  Tashkaris and Geithners and they just sit up there openly stealing robbing
[44:30.140 --> 44:35.300]  everything engineering Ponzi schemes blowing them out feeding all the
[44:35.300 --> 44:39.860]  taxpayer money the entire GDP and six months into their mouth
[44:39.860 --> 44:44.140]  militarizing the police ignoring the governors openly announcing they're
[44:44.140 --> 44:48.020]  going to put regular troops on the streets now testing regular army and
[44:48.020 --> 44:53.220]  Air Force MPs all over the nation running checkpoints openly demonizing
[44:53.220 --> 44:57.540]  veterans openly demonizing conservatives openly demonizing anybody that talks
[44:57.540 --> 45:03.220]  about the new world order openly having the regular army spy on the tea parties
[45:03.220 --> 45:07.700]  in the in the Fed protests you know a month ago we got the secret document
[45:07.700 --> 45:11.260]  about the army said we were terrorist and we're watching our every move and had
[45:11.260 --> 45:15.220]  page after page about how to be careful and don't let them know your army when
[45:15.220 --> 45:18.460]  you're in the crowds when you know they're up there protesting the Fed in
[45:18.460 --> 45:22.380]  Dallas and Houston when they're spying on Ron Paul myself and Ron Paul's
[45:22.380 --> 45:28.180]  brother who was at the rally we had and wash them they may try to kill you if
[45:28.180 --> 45:32.300]  they live because they hate the military so much don't let them know your
[45:32.300 --> 45:38.260]  military they may try to bomb you I mean and we published the document people
[45:38.260 --> 45:41.500]  deny it they deny the my act document they deny the one that came out a week
[45:41.500 --> 45:45.820]  and a half ago that the feds put out then later admit they're real and then
[45:45.820 --> 45:50.420]  now papers in Maryland papers in California papers in Tennessee go oh
[45:50.420 --> 45:56.220]  yeah the army spying on the tea parties because they may be terrorist and the
[45:56.220 --> 46:03.260]  army spying on the in the Fed just a secret police it's like East Germany and
[46:03.260 --> 46:07.860]  then they just announced the feds just come right out in the house oh yeah
[46:07.860 --> 46:12.300]  we're if we stop you at a checkpoint we're gonna take your tissue swab out of
[46:12.300 --> 46:18.140]  your cheek and they announcing Kansas and Missouri and Texas and all over the
[46:18.140 --> 46:21.580]  country that's just what I saw the last week Texas Kansas and Missouri oh yeah
[46:21.580 --> 46:25.220]  we're gonna have warrantless checkpoints we're gonna take your blood at the
[46:25.220 --> 46:28.780]  checkpoints but don't worry we have a warrant a rubber stamp warrant where a
[46:28.780 --> 46:33.500]  judge just gives them a warrant to do it to everybody that's not a real warrant
[46:34.220 --> 46:39.380]  and that is enough all over the country body scanners are going in and they
[46:39.380 --> 46:43.020]  direct whole families into them and scan your sons and daughters your wives
[46:43.020 --> 46:47.020]  your entire neck and body it spins around you in enough to take your shoes
[46:47.020 --> 46:51.140]  off and walk through all the athletes foot on the ground where thousands walk
[46:51.140 --> 47:00.100]  through every day you know I played football and sports and all that there's
[47:00.100 --> 47:03.860]  always really bad athletes foot fungus in those gyms and I was always having to
[47:03.860 --> 47:08.780]  spray ten actin and everything else on my feet till I learned how to just throw
[47:08.780 --> 47:12.900]  away my socks after football season because the spores stand there even if
[47:12.900 --> 47:16.660]  you wash them in bleach but you know when I get athletes foot now even though I
[47:16.660 --> 47:21.900]  changed my socks twice a day I get it when I will when I'm do the ritual of
[47:21.900 --> 47:25.860]  being humiliated prostrating myself before the establishment oh you got a
[47:25.860 --> 47:29.020]  bottle of water got to throw it away oh the secret police are gonna ask you
[47:29.020 --> 47:32.180]  questions you got to walk through the athletes foot because you might want to
[47:32.180 --> 47:37.820]  shoe bomb things it's all part of a ritual and now oh go over here we're
[47:37.820 --> 47:41.900]  gonna send you into a scanner that's gonna scan around your body and then we're
[47:41.900 --> 47:47.380]  gonna have a 360 biometric that sonar they bombard you with sound waves and
[47:47.380 --> 47:52.820]  your genitals everything I mean if you've got a mole on your genitals it's
[47:52.820 --> 47:57.260]  that detailed you ever heard the term more human than human or it's as it's as
[47:57.260 --> 48:02.060]  if that painting by Rembrandt captured the person's soul even more than a photo
[48:02.060 --> 48:06.740]  could the light the way you you know you can add more to it almost bring what
[48:06.740 --> 48:11.860]  you what the mind's eye sees out that's what these scanners do it gives you a
[48:11.860 --> 48:17.580]  better image of the body than playboy you know with some girls spread out in
[48:17.580 --> 48:23.220]  there in the centerfold because it shows every pore in your skin every
[48:23.220 --> 48:28.780]  contour mathematically calculated out diagramed and then you know why they
[48:28.780 --> 48:34.020]  admit they want that remember seeing when the CIA a few years ago it came out
[48:34.020 --> 48:39.140]  was funding a couple of big clothing stores for upscale suits for men and
[48:39.140 --> 48:42.060]  women they would have oh you step in here we get your proper fitting the
[48:42.060 --> 48:46.260]  machine scans you turns out they were selling that data to the feds as a beta
[48:46.260 --> 48:54.620]  test and also getting people acclimated that body scanner is getting a 360
[48:54.620 --> 48:59.060]  biometric read then they've got cameras that through your clothes can get a
[48:59.060 --> 49:02.940]  hundred percent match on your walk just like a fingerprint a retina scan a
[49:02.940 --> 49:08.780]  blood vessel scan in your eye a hand scan they know your walk and not even
[49:08.780 --> 49:12.380]  your walk that's some of the stuff 10 years old they can just look at your
[49:12.380 --> 49:17.540]  body off the scan and get enough key points of that off your knees your
[49:17.540 --> 49:23.900]  elbows your chest line your brow ridges to tell who you are even if you're in a
[49:23.900 --> 49:29.300]  disguise and that's what they're using in Iraq they take digital photos of
[49:29.300 --> 49:32.980]  people they're after the news face scans on them they have heat resonance
[49:32.980 --> 49:40.740]  signatures and they admit every US city has a blimp over it already at 95,000
[49:40.740 --> 49:48.900]  feet scanning everything we do and they even put it in mainstream news and I go
[49:48.900 --> 49:52.900]  on mainstream shows and they laugh at me and say he thinks there's imaginary
[49:52.900 --> 49:58.100]  blimps and I go well here's MSNBC and AP and they go it didn't real and laugh
[49:58.100 --> 50:03.340]  even when the blimps are there and the public gets telephoto lenses out and
[50:03.340 --> 50:09.460]  shows it Larry King live on CNN ABC News say aliens are invading they're the
[50:09.460 --> 50:14.100]  conspiracy theorist they know full well those are blimps they got rudders on
[50:14.100 --> 50:18.060]  them they got their the blisters of surveillance equipment on their bellies
[50:18.060 --> 50:25.180]  they got the solar panel wings and the public is so dumb that when they on a
[50:25.180 --> 50:29.660]  clear day see the blimps and get their telephoto video cameras out the news goes
[50:29.660 --> 50:36.140]  flying saucers alien cigar craft see how it works and Larry King laughs at you
[50:36.140 --> 50:40.740]  blend back knows he's meant to divide people in the right wing Oberman knows
[50:40.740 --> 50:44.620]  he's meant to divide people in the left wing to control us they know that's
[50:44.620 --> 50:48.740]  their job Larry King knows his job is to call surveillance blimps flying
[50:48.740 --> 51:00.500]  saucers will come back take more your phone calls stay with us
[51:00.500 --> 51:05.460]  this year many of us will have to make the tough decision on what to cut back on
[51:05.460 --> 51:10.180]  and what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future in these troubled
[51:10.180 --> 51:14.140]  times one of the most important things your family can have is good health some
[51:14.140 --> 51:18.060]  of the contributors to poor health are parasites viruses toxins and heavy

[54:46.700 --> 54:54.980]  greetings Alex how you doing good sir hey you know it's uh Friday night I had a
[54:54.980 --> 54:58.020]  friend of mine on here it's interesting you were talking about the occult and
[54:58.020 --> 55:01.860]  stuff and I was trying to you know he's a fresh college graduate from one of
[55:01.860 --> 55:07.020]  these wonderful prison grade colleges here and it was like a literal exorcism
[55:07.020 --> 55:12.580]  with this guy I mean I was running I mean it's like I needed a partner to tag
[55:12.580 --> 55:19.540]  team on these on him and it's like this ever the active denial systems are just
[55:19.540 --> 55:24.380]  it's so amazing I'm you know the guy's brain is and not just him but others
[55:24.380 --> 55:28.780]  their brains have never worked so hard in their lives they are programmed to
[55:28.780 --> 55:34.860]  deny everything they're in a lazy spell I mean I use the Lord of the Rings
[55:34.860 --> 55:38.300]  analogy but remember when the row him king it's like sitting there in his
[55:38.300 --> 55:42.060]  throne all old and he's got a bad attitude and he can't do anything he
[55:42.060 --> 55:45.860]  can't even get up and then finally it gets broken he looks 20 years younger
[55:45.860 --> 55:50.620]  over you know second that's what it is it's like they are under a spell when
[55:50.620 --> 55:54.380]  you've got open evil and corruption running wild everywhere but they've
[55:54.380 --> 55:58.660]  incrementally denied it denied it so they're invested in continuing denying
[55:58.660 --> 56:03.500]  it oh yeah I mean you know and it's it's like I try to tell people you know it's
[56:03.500 --> 56:09.220]  like I voted for Bush I voted for Bush in 2000 I've been over work because he was
[56:09.220 --> 56:14.340]  talking big government I was I know the spell because I was under it but we
[56:14.340 --> 56:18.340]  think I it took me five years to get out of it and we ain't got five years for
[56:18.340 --> 56:23.740]  people to get over the fact they backed a bad play the fact that they backed the
[56:23.740 --> 56:27.300]  you know because I told the guy Friday night I said buddy you felt for the
[56:27.300 --> 56:32.220]  slickest package I've ever seen and I've been studying I mean I'm only 35 but
[56:32.220 --> 56:35.780]  politics are the interest of me when I was seven I watched Bill Emerson in a
[56:35.780 --> 56:40.260]  debate live with my mom and ever since then you know but Obama's the slickest
[56:40.260 --> 56:44.820]  well it's more than one last thing I'll let you go or you can let me go Alex
[56:44.820 --> 56:50.100]  here in Chicago I just want everybody to know I heard the damn bomb the the
[56:50.100 --> 56:55.020]  alarms the sirens that usually run on Tuesdays at 10 o'clock Chicago people
[56:55.020 --> 56:58.380]  know what I'm talking about I heard him the other night Thursday night at like
[56:58.380 --> 57:02.460]  one between 1 30 and two in the morning running for a while on a clear night
[57:02.460 --> 57:07.460]  kind of scared me don't know what's up with that maybe it's a test but uh hey
[57:07.460 --> 57:10.540]  thanks for let me have a minute Alex sure no I appreciate you calling I was
[57:10.540 --> 57:14.780]  just gonna back you up what you were saying about being mesmerized that's
[57:14.780 --> 57:20.580]  how con men work they act so confident so slick you know it's I saw a story in
[57:20.580 --> 57:25.820]  the Austin Chronicle about a guy that had stolen he's been caught with the
[57:25.820 --> 57:30.020]  bikes hundreds and hundreds of expensive 10 $15,000 bikes he go to these bike
[57:30.020 --> 57:34.300]  rallies he would get to be people's friends they said he was so charming so
[57:34.300 --> 57:37.420]  nice so over the top he'd go to their houses he'd see what they had and then
[57:37.420 --> 57:41.580]  he'd come and break in later and people couldn't believe it when he finally got
[57:41.580 --> 57:48.980]  caught and that's how a confidence man works is they get you invested in the
[57:48.980 --> 57:55.980]  fact that this is your friend and then even as you start getting conned you
[57:55.980 --> 57:58.900]  can't pull out of it because you don't want to admit you were conned so you
[57:58.900 --> 58:02.740]  kind of just go along with the con because you don't want to admit you were
[58:02.740 --> 58:10.180]  conned here's an example I do a radio show you know out of another studio and
[58:10.180 --> 58:15.060]  there's a lot of different news people come through there and a lot a lot of
[58:15.060 --> 58:18.260]  them didn't like Bush and as soon and they were all real friendly towards me
[58:18.260 --> 58:22.540]  now that I'm always going after Obama they're not sophisticated enough to
[58:22.540 --> 58:27.900]  understand I'm saying they're all bad they won't even talk to me now I mean
[58:27.900 --> 58:32.380]  that's mind control and also that's intellectual ignorance how would you
[58:32.380 --> 58:37.980]  not talk to somebody but see this is their God this is their savior and it's
[58:37.980 --> 58:46.140]  attacking them when you attack Obama thank you for listening to GCN visit

[1:01:09.140 --> 1:01:14.620]  you're on the year yes at least I want I want to thank you very much and I also
[1:01:14.620 --> 1:01:20.980]  want to apologize to you because I have just recently found your program on the
[1:01:20.980 --> 1:01:26.180]  on the internet and I wish I would have found it a long time you long time ago
[1:01:26.180 --> 1:01:32.100]  you and and Steve quail we found Steve quail's program first and we've been
[1:01:32.100 --> 1:01:37.620]  listening to him now for oh probably about a couple months and been listening
[1:01:37.620 --> 1:01:42.780]  to you now here for probably about a month I'm a non-didomination old pastor
[1:01:42.780 --> 1:01:50.580]  in Ohio and and I'll tell you what I have home churches the Lord told me to
[1:01:50.580 --> 1:01:55.780]  shut down the church we right from the beginning I've been a pastor since 87
[1:01:55.780 --> 1:02:01.980]  1987 I've never received a paycheck from the church and I've never we never
[1:02:01.980 --> 1:02:09.300]  became 501c3 either and I still receive letters in the mail every year
[1:02:09.300 --> 1:02:17.060]  sometimes two that talks about us being part of the government and they know it
[1:02:17.060 --> 1:02:21.860]  has a it has a it's a one full page letter tells you everything that you
[1:02:21.860 --> 1:02:29.700]  know they would like the pastors to do and and so if I'm getting it the only
[1:02:29.700 --> 1:02:32.900]  thing I can figure is the the states must be going down through the list of
[1:02:32.900 --> 1:02:38.700]  who pastors are and sending it to every pastor in every state not just big
[1:02:38.700 --> 1:02:47.140]  churches now explain to folks exactly what you were sent well I do I don't have
[1:02:47.140 --> 1:02:49.900]  time to get the letter I didn't get it out I didn't even think I'd actually get
[1:02:49.900 --> 1:02:53.940]  through to be honest with you but I do have a little specifically re I mean
[1:02:53.940 --> 1:02:59.220]  recap what's happening okay I've got the letter and what it is is they want us to
[1:02:59.220 --> 1:03:06.420]  help other words you know share with our people and they even mentioned Romans
[1:03:06.420 --> 1:03:13.380]  13 as far as how you to be suburbian to the to the government well I'm pretty
[1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:20.260]  much like the pastor down in and in Arizona who got tasered for the way he
[1:03:20.260 --> 1:03:23.700]  speaks out I tell you what happened pastor you say you've only been
[1:03:23.700 --> 1:03:31.060]  listening a few months or a month let me explain what this is in 2006 they
[1:03:31.060 --> 1:03:35.860]  recruited and paid 13,000 preachers the first one we learned about it was in
[1:03:35.860 --> 1:03:41.540]  Ohio where you're calling from and they said this is a secret FEMA plan we got
[1:03:41.540 --> 1:03:46.460]  hundreds of pages of secret documents from him how to turn your guns in how to
[1:03:46.460 --> 1:03:51.300]  go to FEMA camps Romans 13 how it's of the Lord then we reported it people
[1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:56.940]  denied it then mainstream news a year and a half later in the end of 2007
[1:03:56.940 --> 1:04:03.340]  admitted it was real and then it's now 26,000 preachers now they're now even
[1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:08.020]  going out to all the small preachers as you know there's probably well over a
[1:04:08.020 --> 1:04:13.100]  hundred thousand or more and I would guess are you a smaller pastor sir we
[1:04:13.100 --> 1:04:18.260]  average anywhere we have home churches and we average oh probably about 50
[1:04:18.260 --> 1:04:23.300]  people yes so see they're even down to the home churches now the final phase
[1:04:23.300 --> 1:04:28.460]  and if you go back to them and say I disagree with you they put you on a
[1:04:28.460 --> 1:04:36.380]  Cointel probe assassination list I'm not kidding you if you were to respond back
[1:04:36.380 --> 1:04:42.900]  they put you on a pick up or kill list stay there I got Naomi Wolf coming up

[1:09:32.340 --> 1:09:36.180]  we are now under their control
[1:09:36.180 --> 1:09:49.180]  are we gonna resist are we gonna let them feed on us we're gonna let them have
[1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:51.620]  a bloody harvest
[1:09:51.620 --> 1:10:06.220]  to the court of the crimson stand up it is the light that they cannot stand it
[1:10:06.220 --> 1:10:15.660]  is courage that defeats them it is the spirit of courage the spirit of
[1:10:15.660 --> 1:10:25.020]  goodness for those of us that love innocence beauty and our willingness to
[1:10:25.020 --> 1:10:31.660]  stand up against the new world order now we just went live at prison planet dot
[1:10:31.660 --> 1:10:36.060]  TV and Naomi Wolf has so many phone line problems I just canceled again and
[1:10:36.060 --> 1:10:42.900]  we're done with her for now well we just went live at prison planet dot TV and
[1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:46.740]  we just had a caller earlier but we had to go to break he's a pastor in Ohio he
[1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:52.620]  said I just got a letter from the feds saying Romans 13 tell my home church of
[1:10:52.620 --> 1:10:57.060]  50 people to go along basically with the things that are happening Romans 13
[1:10:57.060 --> 1:11:01.700]  and he's a new listener he said he didn't know about the clergy response
[1:11:01.700 --> 1:11:06.220]  teams so will you guys Google clergy response teams on YouTube I want to
[1:11:06.220 --> 1:11:11.460]  play this for the pastor because he said he didn't know about it in 2006 we got
[1:11:11.460 --> 1:11:15.300]  secret documents pastor butch paw did I didn't talk to the two preachers got the
[1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:21.300]  documents published them at info wars dot com one of the pastors they figured
[1:11:21.300 --> 1:11:25.500]  that he went to a local store faxed the documents I said should I erase these
[1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:29.580]  fax numbers he said oh no it's just a store 20 miles from where I live they'll
[1:11:29.580 --> 1:11:34.060]  never figure that out I said okay we won't take the fax number off within 24
[1:11:34.060 --> 1:11:37.740]  hours of us posting at FBI went in there with homeland security federal
[1:11:37.740 --> 1:11:42.100]  marshals threatened the place looked at their surveillance cameras looked at
[1:11:42.100 --> 1:11:46.020]  highway surveillance cameras figured out who the pastor was came to his office
[1:11:46.020 --> 1:11:49.740]  were waiting for him in his office threatening him when he got there he
[1:11:49.740 --> 1:11:53.860]  also worked at the hospital as their chaplain had his own office for free they
[1:11:53.860 --> 1:11:57.380]  said get out of here you don't work here anymore now he had a pretty good size
[1:11:57.380 --> 1:12:05.940]  church people still didn't believe it people still didn't believe then it
[1:12:05.940 --> 1:12:12.420]  came out on mainstream news they have doubled it to 26,000 pastors they've
[1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:15.260]  built the FEMA camps notice the bill introduced for FEMA camps for the
[1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:18.580]  already built ones said oh we're gonna pay to have medical centers and local
[1:12:18.580 --> 1:12:23.620]  pastors to help in the community they're gonna call them horrible work camps it's
[1:12:23.620 --> 1:12:28.380]  oh it's a loving government camp and how does it start how about predict a year
[1:12:28.380 --> 1:12:32.420]  ago it would start as people become homeless they force you out of the tent
[1:12:32.420 --> 1:12:37.220]  cities on national parks state parks and other places into the facilities where
[1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:40.940]  your prisoners where your frisk and control that's now happening in
[1:12:40.940 --> 1:12:48.980]  California Hawaiian other areas so this is actually going on right now I want
[1:12:48.980 --> 1:12:57.580]  folks to understand that let's go ahead and cut over here let's go ahead and go
[1:12:57.580 --> 1:13:04.060]  to that YouTube clip here it is law ever become a reality in America some fear
[1:13:04.060 --> 1:13:09.700]  any nuclear biological or chemical attack on u.s. territory might trigger just
[1:13:09.700 --> 1:13:13.940]  that and as case lay news 12 Jeff Farrell discovered the clergy would help the
[1:13:13.940 --> 1:13:22.340]  government with potentially their biggest problem us Charlton Heston's famous
[1:13:22.340 --> 1:13:27.300]  declaration captures a truly American value the overarching desire to
[1:13:27.300 --> 1:13:31.620]  protect our freedoms but gun confiscation is exactly what happened
[1:13:31.620 --> 1:13:36.100]  during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans us
[1:13:36.100 --> 1:13:40.740]  troops also arrived something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's
[1:13:40.740 --> 1:13:47.340]  elimination of the 1878 posse comatose act that forbid us troops from policing
[1:13:47.340 --> 1:13:53.300]  on American soil if martial law weren't acted here at home like depicted in the
[1:13:53.300 --> 1:13:57.740]  movie the siege easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical and
[1:13:57.740 --> 1:14:01.780]  that's exactly what the clergy response team as it's called help to
[1:14:01.780 --> 1:14:05.780]  accomplish in New Orleans the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's
[1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:09.180]  cooperate get this thing over with and then we'll settle the differences once
[1:14:09.180 --> 1:14:13.820]  the crisis is over such clergy response teams would walk a tight rope between the
[1:14:13.820 --> 1:14:17.980]  needs of the government versus the wishes of the public in a lot of cases
[1:14:17.980 --> 1:14:21.380]  these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're
[1:14:21.380 --> 1:14:26.180]  helping to diffuse that situation for the clergy one of the biggest tools that
[1:14:26.180 --> 1:14:30.940]  they will have in helping calm the public down or obey the law is the Bible
[1:14:30.940 --> 1:14:36.260]  itself specifically Romans Romans 13 because the government is established
[1:14:36.260 --> 1:14:39.860]  by the Lord you know and that's what we believe in the Christian faith that's
[1:14:39.860 --> 1:14:43.660]  what stated in the scripture civil rights advocates believe the amount of
[1:14:43.660 --> 1:14:48.660]  public cooperation may depend largely on how long they expect a suspension of
[1:14:48.660 --> 1:14:55.020]  their rights might last Jeff Farrell KSLA News 12 reporting
[1:14:55.020 --> 1:14:59.220]  now let's play that in part about martial law I want to finish up we we we
[1:14:59.220 --> 1:15:02.340]  cut the tape off about 10 seconds early go ahead and back it up according to
[1:15:02.340 --> 1:15:06.100]  Tuberville during Hurricane Katrina the clergy response team provided 38
[1:15:06.100 --> 1:15:11.500]  chaplains a day around the clock at eight different camps now remember oh
[1:15:11.500 --> 1:15:18.060]  camps this was secret until 2007 we told you a year and a half before with the
[1:15:18.060 --> 1:15:23.020]  documents it's like we broke the my act and everything else because folks that
[1:15:23.020 --> 1:15:26.620]  are involved in all this nowhere to send their documents to send to the
[1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:33.500]  address that's on info wars.com ladies and gentlemen this is what's going on so
[1:15:33.500 --> 1:15:37.940]  now they've gotten even down and found out who the small churches are and
[1:15:37.940 --> 1:15:42.020]  they're sending them letters pastor I would like you to fax us I know we just
[1:15:42.020 --> 1:15:44.820]  moved offices a few months ago and I still forget our new fax number well you
[1:15:44.820 --> 1:15:48.460]  get the guys to give me the toll-free fax number you can scrub your name out any
[1:15:48.460 --> 1:15:53.340]  numbers on there or put tape over them or make a copy of the document and black
[1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:56.620]  that out I want you to black out your original I want you to fax that to me
[1:15:56.620 --> 1:16:01.900]  and what other pastors to do this because again secret police training
[1:16:01.900 --> 1:16:05.340]  pastors to tell their flocks to go to FEMA camps take injections turn their
[1:16:05.340 --> 1:16:08.620]  guns in that's in the original FEMA documents we posted almost three years
[1:16:08.620 --> 1:16:14.180]  ago this is very creepy then you know that Romans 13 didn't really say that
[1:16:14.180 --> 1:16:19.580]  the whole chapter doesn't say that the mean if you are a Christian and follow
[1:16:19.580 --> 1:16:24.340]  that faith almost all of the prophets in the Old New Testament were killed or
[1:16:24.340 --> 1:16:30.100]  tortured or imprisoned Christ wouldn't follow the government's orders it's all
[1:16:30.100 --> 1:16:35.380]  taken out of context but pastor for those that just tuned in we're also live
[1:16:35.380 --> 1:16:40.820]  at prisonplanet.tv recap the letter you got go over it for folks okay I've been
[1:16:40.820 --> 1:16:45.700]  looking for it my wife and I we've been telling our fires apart our files apart
[1:16:45.700 --> 1:16:50.660]  because I left it in the envelope and when you send back your response you are
[1:16:50.660 --> 1:16:56.220]  to put it in your church letterhead what your responses to that and you send it
[1:16:56.220 --> 1:17:01.100]  back a copy of that letter with the... I understand you called in didn't think you'd
[1:17:01.100 --> 1:17:04.500]  get on air but it's problems that you did and it's somewhere in your stacks of
[1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:07.860]  stuff look I've seen similar letters you know we wrote the secret document so I
[1:17:07.860 --> 1:17:12.140]  believe you paraphrase them from memory what it says and the point is they're
[1:17:12.140 --> 1:17:15.740]  doing a survey just like Obama with millions door-to-door do you support
[1:17:15.740 --> 1:17:20.980]  him or not now they're even down to small churches not just recruiting them but
[1:17:20.980 --> 1:17:25.100]  doing a survey of you respond back that you do believe in Romans 13 that we
[1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:27.980]  should do whatever the government says they're now going to try to recruit you
[1:17:27.980 --> 1:17:32.500]  so you hear CIA ads on radio and TV they're tripling the size of humid
[1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:36.540]  domestically literally taking over everything but specifically tell folks
[1:17:36.540 --> 1:17:39.260]  what's happening go ahead okay
[1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:43.100]  first of all you are right because i received two phone calls and it was just
[1:17:43.100 --> 1:17:45.500]  like a survey
[1:17:45.500 --> 1:17:47.820]  and it asked us for do you support
[1:17:47.820 --> 1:17:50.220]  obama and do you support uh...
[1:17:50.220 --> 1:17:54.100]  uh... his agenda here's and congress is agenda
[1:17:54.100 --> 1:17:55.980]  well i said no
[1:17:55.980 --> 1:17:58.060]  because i didn't vote for him to begin with
[1:17:58.060 --> 1:18:02.140]  and then i hung up well it's like two weeks later we got the same thing
[1:18:02.140 --> 1:18:06.220]  and and i just hung up i didn't even didn't even answer anything
[1:18:06.220 --> 1:18:07.180]  but then
[1:18:07.180 --> 1:18:09.940]  i got i've gotten two letters now so far
[1:18:09.940 --> 1:18:12.780]  and one of the things that point out one of the first things that a point
[1:18:12.780 --> 1:18:13.620]  out is
[1:18:13.620 --> 1:18:14.820]  that if uh...
[1:18:14.820 --> 1:18:18.060]  the your church being five oh one c three
[1:18:18.060 --> 1:18:20.420]  uh... in other words tax exempt
[1:18:20.420 --> 1:18:23.620]  that it states that you're not allowed to uh...
[1:18:23.620 --> 1:18:26.940]  you know make any political statement things like that from the pulpit and
[1:18:26.940 --> 1:18:29.620]  stuff like in other words it tells you all the things that you
[1:18:29.620 --> 1:18:30.780]  cannot do
[1:18:30.780 --> 1:18:32.980]  you know just kind of briefly touches over them
[1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:37.260]  what you cannot do if you're a five oh one c three stop right there
[1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:42.420]  again and i've seen those letters they are intimidating people congress make no
[1:18:42.420 --> 1:18:46.020]  law congress will make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[1:18:46.020 --> 1:18:48.100]  or prohibiting the free exercise there of
[1:18:48.100 --> 1:18:51.740]  congress can have five oh one c threes it's not in their jurisdiction but they
[1:18:51.740 --> 1:18:52.940]  issue them
[1:18:52.940 --> 1:18:56.300]  to charities they trick churches to sign a contract
[1:18:56.300 --> 1:18:58.100]  then waving their rights
[1:18:58.100 --> 1:18:59.140]  didn't they say
[1:18:59.140 --> 1:19:01.660]  by the way you're not allowed to be political during the crisis that's
[1:19:01.660 --> 1:19:05.380]  coming but would you like to join us and be our political mouthpiece
[1:19:05.380 --> 1:19:09.300]  then you get to keep your five oh one c three of these lazy preachers
[1:19:09.300 --> 1:19:10.780]  we've got mistresses
[1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:12.980]  nice cars a bash fish
[1:19:12.980 --> 1:19:15.820]  four or five days a week i grew up around a bunch of men Dallas
[1:19:15.820 --> 1:19:18.260]  and in the upper middle-class neighborhood i grew up in
[1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:20.380]  uh... they're drunk constantly
[1:19:20.380 --> 1:19:24.300]  to them it's a big business you know their kids you know they are out partying
[1:19:24.300 --> 1:19:27.420]  every day that's how i knew these preachers a lot of famous ones
[1:19:27.420 --> 1:19:29.580]  was much of my neighborhood in Dallas
[1:19:29.580 --> 1:19:32.380]  and then we go to other preachers you know houses that they knew
[1:19:32.380 --> 1:19:33.460]  and so
[1:19:33.460 --> 1:19:37.020]  that's why they're there they're like oh my god my five oh one c three my swimming
[1:19:37.020 --> 1:19:38.020]  pools

[1:19:52.060 --> 1:19:54.860]  uh... just like our government funded poll pot and rags about it to kill three
[1:19:54.860 --> 1:19:55.900]  million people
[1:19:55.900 --> 1:19:57.380]  they want to find out

[1:24:27.820 --> 1:24:34.060]  double that again the next year in 2008 we're now into 2009 I mean that's
[1:24:34.060 --> 1:24:38.020]  classic tyranny hardcore secret police total violation of the first amendment

[1:24:57.060 --> 1:25:01.180]  heavy from a big Baptist church he goes to out and dripping springs I think I
[1:25:01.180 --> 1:25:06.020]  got a copy of that around here somewhere and it was telling the church and the
[1:25:06.020 --> 1:25:09.460]  preacher you do not talk about any politics you do not discuss things if
[1:25:09.460 --> 1:25:14.700]  you have a church dinner at a restaurant church members aren't allowed to talk
[1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:18.380]  see and pretty soon it's you go to a church you can't talk about politics in
[1:25:18.380 --> 1:25:24.620]  your house sorry don't talk about it at a church dinner and the pastors get up
[1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:28.220]  and admonish people that's what Raymond was saying you don't talk bad about the
[1:25:28.220 --> 1:25:31.420]  government you don't talk about it in the pews you don't talk about it in
[1:25:31.420 --> 1:25:38.140]  Sunday school that's what America's about think about that think about how

[1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:40.380]  the pastor Terry in Ohio so they're sitting your letters telling you what
[1:27:40.380 --> 1:27:44.020]  you can and can't do but they're also reminding you in there to not be
[1:27:44.020 --> 1:27:47.700]  political and to follow Romans 13 in that a free country get government
[1:27:47.700 --> 1:27:52.100]  letters saying here's the scripture for you Hitler's favorite scripture pastor
[1:27:52.100 --> 1:27:56.380]  can't know what does it like to be getting this well to be honest with you
[1:27:56.380 --> 1:28:02.940]  it didn't bother me a bit because first of all as soon as I started the church
[1:28:02.940 --> 1:28:06.580]  when we had the elders together and stuff like that we started at home and
[1:28:06.580 --> 1:28:10.820]  then we grew and and we had a church and I told the people right then and there
[1:28:10.820 --> 1:28:15.100]  that first of all I wouldn't be taking a paycheck because I thought according to
[1:28:15.100 --> 1:28:19.300]  what the Lord has shown me that this is a calling and not an occupation so I
[1:28:19.300 --> 1:28:24.140]  worked a 40 to 50 hours a week job had my own benefits and everything else and I
[1:28:24.140 --> 1:28:28.980]  taught and preached on Wednesdays Sunday morning Sunday night by the way Paul
[1:28:28.980 --> 1:28:36.060]  finance everything he did absolutely he he made tents and shared sheep and but
[1:28:36.060 --> 1:28:39.260]  one of the things that I wanted to point out to share with you and your
[1:28:39.260 --> 1:28:44.780]  listeners is that first of all thank God for you Alex and Mr. Jones and and

[1:34:14.660 --> 1:34:18.220]  covered here and if you watch what happened in Iraq in places like Fallujah
[1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:23.340]  they admitted they had a red and blue list that goes back to Vietnam with the
[1:34:23.340 --> 1:34:28.620]  phoenix teams and in and the rest of it and folks they admit publicly there
[1:34:28.620 --> 1:34:33.820]  didn't I mean I've got army documents where I am called a terrorist for going

[1:34:56.780 --> 1:35:00.900]  all be stolen everything else all right I said I get to other callers I want the
[1:35:00.900 --> 1:35:05.180]  pastor to be able to finish up pastor Romans 13 the way they the government
[1:35:05.180 --> 1:35:08.020]  sends you letters saying worship the government do what they say then we
[1:35:08.020 --> 1:35:10.900]  should have followed Hitler because all governments are of God is that pastor
[1:35:10.900 --> 1:35:13.980]  said on the news earlier the founding fathers shouldn't have fought King
[1:35:13.980 --> 1:35:20.220]  George why was John the Baptist the head cut off why was Paul killed why were
[1:35:20.220 --> 1:35:24.180]  people crucified what why were they boiled in oil why were they imprisoned
[1:35:24.180 --> 1:35:30.180]  why did Moses follow the orders I mean the whole Bible is about fighting evil
[1:35:30.180 --> 1:35:34.060]  standing up to tyranny you know you know who will protect the innocent from the
[1:35:34.060 --> 1:35:39.060]  wicked ones there's all those verses and when they went when the you know the
[1:35:39.060 --> 1:35:43.220]  evil comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord lift up a standard against it
[1:35:43.220 --> 1:35:47.220]  I mean if that evil government that's coming against you's a government how
[1:35:47.220 --> 1:35:51.420]  could you stand up against it because it's of the Lord I mean this is kind of
[1:35:51.420 --> 1:35:55.820]  an eastern mysticism view really of you make what you believe you know look at
[1:35:55.820 --> 1:36:01.580]  India intelligent smart people but they believe in just magical the secret
[1:36:01.580 --> 1:36:05.020]  thinking and then so everybody's literally living in feces on the side of
[1:36:05.020 --> 1:36:08.380]  the street and people are starving that everywhere you know it's just magical
[1:36:08.380 --> 1:36:12.420]  thinking of I saw all these comments on the preacher with hundreds of thousands
[1:36:12.420 --> 1:36:16.780]  views on the show tomorrow who got beat up at the checkpoint you know 75 miles
[1:36:16.780 --> 1:36:21.940]  over the border the he's a carpenter in his spare time he had his tools you
[1:36:21.940 --> 1:36:28.220]  know real he owns the real preachers actually have a day job but they beat
[1:36:28.220 --> 1:36:31.260]  him up savaging split his head open for saying you can't search my car without a
[1:36:31.260 --> 1:36:35.020]  warrant this is becoming a big issue because the Constitution free zones a
[1:36:35.020 --> 1:36:39.740]  hundred miles into the border and they were under there going Romans 13 you got
[1:36:39.740 --> 1:36:42.820]  what you deserve pastries you know what they said I mean if he said throw your
[1:36:42.820 --> 1:36:47.020]  child into a meat grinder that the Lord you don't like false of doom come to me
[1:36:47.020 --> 1:36:50.980]  my child come to me and you know they just jump off the balcony because you
[1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:55.300]  know the preachers of the Lord the the governments of the Lord go ahead and
[1:36:55.300 --> 1:36:59.580]  make your point there is I want to do this because I want people on your show
[1:36:59.580 --> 1:37:03.780]  to that he doesn't hear so to understand what the Bible really says in Romans
[1:37:03.780 --> 1:37:09.020]  13 because this is the truth and I already put this together it was if you
[1:37:09.020 --> 1:37:14.180]  are blinded by spiritual truth you will be blinded by natural truth in other
[1:37:14.180 --> 1:37:18.020]  words if you are lied to as far as what you're being told the Bible says then
[1:37:18.020 --> 1:37:21.820]  the people in the world the natural world they can tell you that whatever they
[1:37:21.820 --> 1:37:25.820]  want to tell you because you're already blinded but listen to what Romans 13
[1:37:25.820 --> 1:37:31.300]  chapter 13 verses 1 through through 7 listen to what it says it says the
[1:37:31.300 --> 1:37:37.260]  government the government's governments are ordained of God and are to be
[1:37:37.260 --> 1:37:43.060]  obeyed they are to bear the sword and execute vengeance on evildoers and they
[1:37:43.060 --> 1:37:48.540]  are entitled to gather taxes from the citizenry or from the citizens the
[1:37:48.540 --> 1:37:55.660]  rights of the government are derived from the governed that's us a citizen
[1:37:55.660 --> 1:38:01.220]  should neither cringe before government nor be subvergent to it he is a
[1:38:01.220 --> 1:38:07.980]  patriot who should love his country he is not a slave to it only as long as God
[1:38:07.980 --> 1:38:14.100]  as God given rights of religious and political liberty exist if he compelled
[1:38:14.100 --> 1:38:19.380]  to render government its taxes import duties and the like it's just like when
[1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:25.700]  Caesar's laws required the Christians to break God's law he must resist Caesar and
[1:38:25.700 --> 1:38:33.140]  obey God period absolutely I'm already on the red list I'm a non-denominational
[1:38:33.140 --> 1:38:39.020]  pastor I'm a Vietnam vet and I have a license to carry so you know what they
[1:38:39.020 --> 1:38:44.780]  can't touch me unless God says it's my time and even then I still win exactly
[1:38:44.780 --> 1:38:47.980]  and that's why when you get past the fear isn't that a liberating feeling you
[1:38:47.980 --> 1:38:52.300]  really start living when you just don't care what you do to me I'm standing up
[1:38:52.300 --> 1:38:58.220]  to you it's it's it's liberating I've seen how how the government truly was
[1:38:58.220 --> 1:39:03.820]  when I was overseas and during Vietnam because every time we'd go out they
[1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:07.940]  always told us if you get caught you weren't supposed to be there but they
[1:39:07.940 --> 1:39:12.820]  were the ones that sent us absolutely well God bless you listen everybody
[1:39:12.820 --> 1:39:16.140]  faxes those will do an article on it be sure in blackout anything you don't
[1:39:16.140 --> 1:39:27.420]  want seen 866-894-1767 866-894-1767 oh boy okay I said I take a lot of calls we
[1:39:27.420 --> 1:39:32.380]  got that caller I had him on for about 35 minutes because it was just so

[1:39:40.140 --> 1:39:45.380]  Alex good sir first I'd like to say thank you for leading up the charge and
[1:39:45.380 --> 1:39:50.900]  opening people's eyes and standing up to the New World Order something I want to
[1:39:50.900 --> 1:39:55.740]  bring to life it's kind of got pushed under the rug lately is Fiat getting
[1:39:55.740 --> 1:39:59.260]  forced by the government will dodge getting forced by the government to
[1:39:59.260 --> 1:40:05.540]  sell to Fiat I know listen they come in with our tax money give them you know
[1:40:05.540 --> 1:40:09.860]  20 billion a piece and then order it handed over to globalist when the head
[1:40:09.860 --> 1:40:15.460]  of Fiat is that Builderburg group member that's right egg Natalie was he was
[1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:20.900]  founder of tri-lateral Commission so not only are they going after Chrysler they
[1:40:20.900 --> 1:40:25.580]  said let's just go after the biggest auto maker in the world now the government
[1:40:25.580 --> 1:40:29.980]  and now the government took our money and is going to privatize the stock the
[1:40:29.980 --> 1:40:33.180]  government money into stock and just give it to themselves I mean just I mean
[1:40:33.180 --> 1:40:37.620]  it's just and then that then you I mean sir I keep going back to this do you
[1:40:37.620 --> 1:40:42.460]  realize how creepy and evil and confirmed bad it is when they are telling
[1:40:42.460 --> 1:40:45.540]  preachers you can't preach and criticize government and by the way do you
[1:40:45.540 --> 1:40:49.460]  want to work for us I mean you wouldn't know how secret police that is when
[1:40:49.460 --> 1:40:52.140]  they're recruiting the executives and the preachers and the community leaders
[1:40:52.140 --> 1:40:58.740]  and running CIA ads on radio and TV everywhere and admittedly got CIA
[1:40:58.740 --> 1:41:02.580]  operating in every town and city I mean we and they're bringing the drugs in and
[1:41:02.580 --> 1:41:05.940]  then they put our kids in jail if they're dumb enough to get caught using them
[1:41:05.940 --> 1:41:10.500]  young people everybody get off drugs don't ever use them not because you're
[1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:13.620]  not old enough or it's too cool for you or you're getting away with something
[1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:17.860]  Hollywood makes it sexy so that you'll use their product and end up in their
[1:41:17.860 --> 1:41:21.140]  presence that's why they've been in Afghanistan for eight years is to get in
[1:41:21.140 --> 1:41:25.580]  the opium is up by eight fold what it was before the globalist went in don't use
[1:41:25.580 --> 1:41:30.900]  drugs beat the man don't use any of their crap in fact don't smoke cigarettes
[1:41:30.900 --> 1:41:36.260]  don't drink don't smoke any don't don't use any of their drugs don't use any of
[1:41:36.260 --> 1:41:42.620]  it let's beat them scumbag filth government go ahead another thing that
[1:41:42.620 --> 1:41:46.940]  I wasn't gonna hit on this I was I was on the internet I don't don't remember
[1:41:46.940 --> 1:41:50.820]  exactly where I was and they were talking about getting information about
[1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:55.540]  them trying to bankrupt Iran and all the old producing countries instead of
[1:41:55.540 --> 1:41:59.460]  fighting I mean that that's a sure enough way to beat them so I mean that
[1:41:59.460 --> 1:42:04.380]  that just that just solidifies with the Obama deception that that there is a
[1:42:04.380 --> 1:42:08.340]  secret society that's running everything and I just want to say with you and the
[1:42:08.340 --> 1:42:13.020]  rest of America that I'm tired of it I'm gonna stand up against tyranny and I'm
[1:42:13.020 --> 1:42:16.780]  mad as hell and I ain't gonna take this shit no more all right I appreciate your
[1:42:16.780 --> 1:42:22.180]  call sir take care let's go ahead and take another call here let's go ahead
[1:42:22.180 --> 1:42:26.060]  and talk to Ken in Texas Ken you're on the air
[1:42:26.060 --> 1:42:30.580]  hello Alex has an important question and a quick statement afterwards I'm really
[1:42:30.580 --> 1:42:35.500]  concerned people that were camped out out there that y'all see them down in
[1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:39.860]  California I understand that they're all gone now and I'm thinking oh wow
[1:42:39.860 --> 1:42:44.060]  where they ship them on top of that mountain in Idaho do you have any idea
[1:42:44.060 --> 1:42:52.220]  I'm concerned about them yeah there was only 150 beds in the sports stadium where
[1:42:52.220 --> 1:42:55.380]  they frisk them and they're basically prisoners and so they just kicked them
[1:42:55.380 --> 1:42:59.260]  off and then harass them and arrest them if they're caught sleeping under bridges
[1:42:59.260 --> 1:43:05.380]  and stuff so they're the show our guys were there and my guys are in Boston
[1:43:05.380 --> 1:43:08.940]  from the Tea Party are in Lexington to be technical they're flying back right
[1:43:08.940 --> 1:43:12.740]  now so my two guys handling that story I don't have personnel to be up on it
[1:43:12.740 --> 1:43:17.060]  we'll make some phone calls when they get back and see if they can get a hold of
[1:43:17.060 --> 1:43:22.460]  in sector they cleared all of them yeah they clear them all out everywhere I'm
[1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:25.940]  concerned about where they are well they're that they're on the streets
[1:43:25.940 --> 1:43:29.380]  being hunted down they say you can't sleep here right statement when you're
[1:43:29.380 --> 1:43:34.780]  through is that you answered me yes or go ahead and I've been thinking there
[1:43:34.780 --> 1:43:39.900]  is least minimum a hundred thousand things that our government is doing to
[1:43:39.900 --> 1:43:45.020]  a fitness from every direction and I'm thinking instead of fighting a hundred
[1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:51.980]  thousand different battles why not we all focus on taking our government back
[1:43:51.980 --> 1:43:56.900]  and then we won't have to fight a hundred thousand different fights well I
[1:43:56.900 --> 1:44:00.620]  agree yeah and when you do the the government the federal government is
[1:44:00.620 --> 1:44:04.300]  ceremonial private banks under international treaties control the US
[1:44:04.300 --> 1:44:08.420]  our government's fully controlled by the IMF World Bank XM Bank International
[1:44:08.420 --> 1:44:13.460]  Bank of Settlements World Trade Organization publicly so you discredit
[1:44:13.460 --> 1:44:17.300]  the New World Order you call for grand jury state and federal to indict the
[1:44:17.300 --> 1:44:21.180]  bankers for the crimes they've publicly committed you take your counties your
[1:44:21.180 --> 1:44:25.500]  cities your states back that's why Fox News is trying to be anti-New World
[1:44:25.500 --> 1:44:29.820]  Order now to pose his opposition to get the people that are waking up
[1:44:29.820 --> 1:44:34.500]  neutralize under their control meanwhile the left is calling anybody who's in
[1:44:34.500 --> 1:44:38.420]  the state sovereignty or anything terrorist to try to sick the police and
[1:44:38.420 --> 1:44:43.900]  military on them because that's the main threat and so take your county your
[1:44:43.900 --> 1:44:48.660]  city your city council back organize pick issues and just keep hammering and
[1:44:48.660 --> 1:44:52.260]  hammering the number one thing is sir the people are awake now that they've
[1:44:52.260 --> 1:44:55.940]  been conned they just don't know how or they don't know one one hundredth of how
[1:44:55.940 --> 1:45:01.420]  bad it is that's why you have to get a radio show or a website or a local
[1:45:01.420 --> 1:45:06.500]  newsletter to create your own group in your area none of us are gonna fix it by
[1:45:06.500 --> 1:45:13.660]  ourselves as a process but you arrest the bankers you arrest the bankers you
[1:45:13.660 --> 1:45:16.820]  arrest the bankers and that's why they're coming out after me all over
[1:45:16.820 --> 1:45:20.340]  national news that's why I'm getting death threats right now like I never had
[1:45:20.340 --> 1:45:25.300]  before and a lot of stuff's coming after me right now because they know that's
[1:45:25.300 --> 1:45:28.820]  their Achilles heel they've committed crimes publicly said opposing his
[1:45:28.820 --> 1:45:32.380]  saviors let's bring him to justice this can all stop and you'll still have the
[1:45:32.380 --> 1:45:35.740]  corrupt apparatus of government there and all the corrupt systems but for now
[1:45:35.740 --> 1:45:39.700]  they won't be able to get their next phase of total global dictatorship in
[1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:43.860]  place let's go ahead and talk to Robert in California Robert you're on the
[1:45:43.860 --> 1:45:52.460]  air Alex yes thank you for your work I found you on the internet about four to
[1:45:52.460 --> 1:45:58.500]  five weeks ago I wanted to let you know that I'm here in San Diego you had had
[1:45:58.500 --> 1:46:01.980]  a caller earlier when I was listening I've been on hold for a while he was
[1:46:01.980 --> 1:46:06.100]  talking about alarms going off in Chicago yeah they've been having in big
[1:46:06.100 --> 1:46:09.580]  cities like Dallas and New York and I'm in New York where it happens they've been
[1:46:09.580 --> 1:46:14.020]  having the air raid sirens go we know which haven't been on in decades is all
[1:46:14.020 --> 1:46:18.380]  part of the fear well interesting let you know I just heard this off the news
[1:46:18.380 --> 1:46:24.460]  cast this morning that Coronado which is a big military town they have not they
[1:46:24.460 --> 1:46:28.060]  said the reason they were going to let their their sirens off were too well
[1:46:28.060 --> 1:46:32.460]  because they didn't know if the system was working or not but I find it quite
[1:46:32.460 --> 1:46:38.440]  interesting that this is happening around the whole United States absolutely
[1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:42.980]  sir they're practicing taking over the FEMA control boxes and radio TV they're
[1:46:42.980 --> 1:46:45.420]  now telling stations of the government's going to be popping in with
[1:46:45.420 --> 1:46:48.980]  announcements now not just about old ladies or kids that are lost but also
[1:46:48.980 --> 1:46:54.540]  terrorists and the weather and other service announcements all radio all TV
[1:46:54.540 --> 1:46:58.260]  internet's controlled by them they're now publicly not just going to control the
[1:46:58.260 --> 1:47:02.060]  big internet hubs but all the small hubs to quote shut the web down for our
[1:47:02.060 --> 1:47:06.260]  safety New York Times they're making their move sir they've stolen everything
[1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:11.900]  they've destroyed us financially but liberty could re-energize and regenerate
[1:47:11.900 --> 1:47:16.220]  all this in a matter of years but let me tell you something once they kill liberty
[1:47:16.220 --> 1:47:19.980]  once they kill liberty see they're threatened by new wealth they don't
[1:47:19.980 --> 1:47:25.700]  want they issue the money they want to end wealth go ahead I'm a Christian and
[1:47:25.700 --> 1:47:29.180]  I gotta say something I attended a new I won't name the church out here it's a
[1:47:29.180 --> 1:47:35.340]  typical Judeo-Christian church and I was listening to one of the messages online
[1:47:35.340 --> 1:47:38.860]  and went to the website I missed a couple weeks and wanted to see where the
[1:47:38.860 --> 1:47:45.980]  pastor's head was at he's up there on the net talking about this church that he
[1:47:45.980 --> 1:47:51.100]  had always went out to speak to and that how they were not prospering and you
[1:47:51.100 --> 1:47:55.140]  know but to them prospering is having a big huge church that's what you know
[1:47:55.140 --> 1:47:58.580]  instead of the gospel and the good news of Jesus Christ with these evil
[1:47:58.580 --> 1:48:03.780]  bastards yeah most well let me stop you most Christian searches are our voodoo
[1:48:03.780 --> 1:48:09.580]  yeah they do rituals they chant and they demand from God what they want that's
[1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:13.500]  that that's what magic is magic is I'm gonna do a ritual and have a little
[1:48:13.500 --> 1:48:18.580]  demon give me a piece of gold or you know give me power and and and and so
[1:48:18.580 --> 1:48:24.660]  most these churches are New World Order big phallus symbols out front satanic
[1:48:24.660 --> 1:48:28.820]  worship centers I mean and the pastors know that they know Easter is an Easter
[1:48:28.820 --> 1:48:34.180]  it's ishtaria ishtar they know the eggs and the rabbit playboy you know is a
[1:48:34.180 --> 1:48:39.140]  symbol of sex the goddess of fertility they know all that these are Satan
[1:48:39.140 --> 1:48:43.740]  worshipers of course they're gonna sit there and tell you that go ahead of the
[1:48:43.740 --> 1:48:49.780]  old canaanite you know religion of you know about the gate do you know about
[1:48:49.780 --> 1:48:53.620]  the ishtar gate you went through the ishtar gate and we beyond that was the
[1:48:53.620 --> 1:49:00.420]  seat of Satan that's what that's in the Old Testament those are the word that's
[1:49:00.420 --> 1:49:05.940]  folks that's how matrix like it is the churches are satanic worship centers
[1:49:05.940 --> 1:49:11.820]  for ishtar and it's even called ishtar and it's on all the Sun cycle dates and
[1:49:11.820 --> 1:49:17.940]  they know that and they don't care it's a big joke they are Satan worshipers and
[1:49:17.940 --> 1:49:23.500]  they know it go ahead well you're 100% correct but I can I went on to their
[1:49:23.500 --> 1:49:27.860]  website and I'm listening to this pastor and so he goes out and he visits this
[1:49:27.860 --> 1:49:32.860]  church and now all of a sudden this new church is big and he asked the pastor
[1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:36.580]  said you know tell me what what was the difference of the church becoming as
[1:49:36.580 --> 1:49:40.860]  big as that it is with you guys he was well we had some anti-government people
[1:49:40.860 --> 1:49:47.340]  in our church and I finally came out and said you know Romans 13 you're to you
[1:49:47.340 --> 1:49:51.740]  know that God ordains governments and you're to to obey God and we've been
[1:49:51.740 --> 1:49:56.900]  prospering ever since bunch of nonsense I told my wife that we are not that
[1:49:56.900 --> 1:49:59.420]  means government money that will go ahead and say the name of the church that
[1:49:59.420 --> 1:50:05.100]  means government money well this is a church in San Diego and it's called the
[1:50:05.100 --> 1:50:10.500]  city church and I heard it online and and after I heard that I told myself I
[1:50:10.500 --> 1:50:14.660]  will not be going back back to that church you know I listen to a lot of
[1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:19.300]  stuff online pastor butch Paul there's a pastor Peters is a bunch of preachers
[1:50:19.300 --> 1:50:23.620]  that are not controlled by the New World Order and that's where I get you know
[1:50:23.620 --> 1:50:28.220]  most of it unless I'm you know reading my Bible for myself and these small
[1:50:28.220 --> 1:50:33.540]  churches gatherings of people doing home churches we were doing that back in the

[2:00:20.220 --> 2:00:22.980]  Alex Jones
[2:00:22.980 --> 2:00:26.900]  all right Steve Cuell has a lot of military and police sources but what he's
[2:00:26.900 --> 2:00:31.100]  about to tell you is already confirmed Maryland and California papers reported
[2:00:31.100 --> 2:00:37.780]  regular army was spying on the tea parties all over the country the FBI was
[2:00:37.780 --> 2:00:40.700]  out there putting people in databases they're even announcing this on the news
[2:00:40.700 --> 2:00:44.620]  to create a chilling effect so you think you're not allowed to protest or
[2:00:44.620 --> 2:00:48.300]  demonstrate it doesn't matter get past the fear we're the majority if they get
[2:00:48.300 --> 2:00:52.700]  us to cower and act all you know that's when the Berlin Wall finally fell and
[2:00:52.700 --> 2:00:56.940]  folks just didn't care anymore we can do this but this is a cowling a Psyop
[2:00:56.940 --> 2:01:03.740]  calling the troops terrorist you know Canada Free Press is reporting FBI
[2:01:03.740 --> 2:01:08.020]  spied on Tea Party Americans we've posted reports as well about the army
[2:01:08.020 --> 2:01:12.620]  doing this up on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com we're gonna get into that
[2:01:12.620 --> 2:01:16.740]  and so much more for the next hour than Gerald Salente joins us Steve Cuell
[2:01:16.740 --> 2:01:20.340]  from Steve Cuell.com we'll get his website up on screen as well we're
[2:01:20.340 --> 2:01:26.060]  simulcasting at prisonplanet.tv Steve Cuell it was a powerful show we did last
[2:01:26.060 --> 2:01:29.940]  Thursday on your show thanks for having me it's good to have you here well Alex
[2:01:29.940 --> 2:01:34.020]  I think the synergy that was present in the show that you did with me was the
[2:01:34.020 --> 2:01:37.740]  one that had to get as much information the shortest amount of time out because
[2:01:37.740 --> 2:01:42.260]  again what you have done and and what I'm trying to do and together we're doing
[2:01:42.260 --> 2:01:47.340]  it is giving different sources and combining our sources and our Intel
[2:01:47.340 --> 2:01:51.140]  gathering abilities and presenting I'd say the most realistic picture to the
[2:01:51.140 --> 2:01:55.260]  people that they could ever hope for and if they listen to mainstream news Alex
[2:01:55.260 --> 2:01:59.820]  I'm telling them they're already mind-controlled dead as zombies because
[2:01:59.820 --> 2:02:04.660]  the mainstream news is nothing more than the mouthpiece of the Illuminati and
[2:02:04.660 --> 2:02:08.220]  let me go to immediately the story the FBI spying on the Tea Party Americans
[2:02:08.220 --> 2:02:12.220]  what most people don't understand is that there's compartmentalized
[2:02:12.220 --> 2:02:16.980]  intelligence within all of the areas of the military and all the national
[2:02:16.980 --> 2:02:22.380]  security agencies and their offshoots and even to some extent obviously the FBI
[2:02:22.380 --> 2:02:26.940]  has compartmentalizers special compartmentalized intelligence what
[2:02:26.940 --> 2:02:33.420]  happened is a directive went out to the 56 special agents in charge across the
[2:02:33.420 --> 2:02:38.980]  country to basically film and to put into the database in Washington and we'll
[2:02:38.980 --> 2:02:42.540]  talk about the restricted access access to that database the moment but
[2:02:42.540 --> 2:02:46.940]  everybody is basically being targeted in other words the Obama administration
[2:02:46.940 --> 2:02:51.540]  is going to quell all First Amendment rights I've been told by my sources deep
[2:02:51.540 --> 2:02:57.460]  inside that the entire if you will patriot movement is to be categorized
[2:02:57.460 --> 2:03:01.100]  it's to be catalogued and we've known this Alex we've told people this but
[2:03:01.100 --> 2:03:06.580]  they don't believe us now it's basically mainstream news and police should know
[2:03:06.580 --> 2:03:10.100]  they've been they've been categorized they don't just say troops in the more
[2:03:10.100 --> 2:03:13.500]  internal documents that I've talked to sources and even allowed to see but
[2:03:13.500 --> 2:03:17.180]  they're so classified you know that we can't even bring them out here because
[2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:21.460]  that's the agreement with sources they're classifying police I mean don't
[2:03:21.460 --> 2:03:23.980]  just think for a minute they're saying number one threat is veterans and gun
[2:03:23.980 --> 2:03:27.780]  owners and leaving cops out that aren't going to play along with this when the
[2:03:27.780 --> 2:03:32.180]  Soviet takeover Nazi takeover happens they always have purges of the military
[2:03:32.180 --> 2:03:36.180]  and police go ahead absolutely I want to make it clear the police and all
[2:03:36.180 --> 2:03:40.660]  corresponding people that go along with the purges of the people that were
[2:03:40.660 --> 2:03:45.420]  listed by Janet Apolitano are absolutely they're the blue list they get
[2:03:45.420 --> 2:03:49.260]  taken out that means liquidated exterminated within 30 to 60 days after
[2:03:49.260 --> 2:03:52.660]  helping of the powers that be the new world order people to go after us now
[2:03:52.660 --> 2:03:55.540]  let me read something because it's important Alex is a really critical
[2:03:55.540 --> 2:04:00.740]  okay the information that was collected by the special agents in charge was
[2:04:00.740 --> 2:04:04.260]  submitted to Washington where at the level of the national security branch
[2:04:04.260 --> 2:04:07.420]  this information was to include the opposite director of intelligence the
[2:04:07.420 --> 2:04:11.740]  DI and integrated with the restricted access database one of the reportedly
[2:04:11.740 --> 2:04:16.020]  is accessible by only two agencies of the 14 agencies that comprise US
[2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:20.100]  intelligence community according to the source over the years when I have talked
[2:04:20.100 --> 2:04:23.940]  about the red and blue list people always say well I want a copy of the list
[2:04:23.940 --> 2:04:29.100]  well it's probably some of the most controlled information or data out there
[2:04:29.100 --> 2:04:33.340]  it evens goes on to say that not all special agents in charge they weren't to
[2:04:33.340 --> 2:04:38.380]  inform everybody within their department so this was a national security
[2:04:38.380 --> 2:04:43.220]  directed Intel gathering event to put into the database to basically come
[2:04:43.220 --> 2:04:48.900]  after everybody Steve quell.com info wars.com Steve stay there well they

[2:06:12.060 --> 2:06:16.500]  I think all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the
[2:06:16.500 --> 2:06:20.460]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while
[2:06:20.460 --> 2:06:25.100]  Obama's already fucking yeah but since day one in this election if you have a
[2:06:25.100 --> 2:06:29.940]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[2:06:29.940 --> 2:06:35.100]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs that's
[2:06:35.100 --> 2:06:41.580]  fascist it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government this

[2:07:04.940 --> 2:07:09.060]  important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health most experts
[2:07:09.060 --> 2:07:12.740]  agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher
[2:07:12.740 --> 2:07:17.500]  alcovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline
[2:07:17.500 --> 2:07:21.780]  ingredients using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water
[2:07:21.780 --> 2:07:26.660]  alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy simply put

[2:08:14.060 --> 2:08:19.620]  okay some stations don't care that first five minutes Steve quail recap who
[2:08:19.620 --> 2:08:22.900]  you are what you do for us I've got a lot of new affiliates lately some of us
[2:08:22.900 --> 2:08:26.700]  may not know who you are just like a lot of folks don't know who I am and I'm on
[2:08:26.700 --> 2:08:31.260]  your show tell folks a little bit about yourself the intel you've got it
[2:08:31.260 --> 2:08:34.220]  integrates a hundred percent everything you were saying when I was on your show
[2:08:34.220 --> 2:08:38.220]  last Thursday was clicking and making connections and we got all the pieces of
[2:08:38.220 --> 2:08:43.620]  the puzzle we know it's classic tyranny but the most virulent form ever and we
[2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:49.020]  know it's a fast-growing viral infection of tyranny we know this is the
[2:08:49.020 --> 2:08:57.700]  virulent signature or wavelength or type I mean I mean no doubt this is what
[2:08:57.700 --> 2:09:01.340]  folks when I get up here and I tell you they're instead of a bank of the world
[2:09:01.340 --> 2:09:07.420]  with a you know world carbon taxes on everything you do and ban fireplaces
[2:09:07.420 --> 2:09:11.220]  it's already happening in many states what I mean all I'm doing is reading
[2:09:11.220 --> 2:09:14.660]  their documents you have to understand these are the people that funded Stalin
[2:09:14.660 --> 2:09:21.420]  Hitler Mao Pol Pot they are vicious okay and that we have always been who they
[2:09:21.420 --> 2:09:26.740]  want to take down and they want to do a Ukrainian type takedown of this nation
[2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:30.980]  Steve quail you've got the floor and you've got the floor I'm gonna just sit
[2:09:30.980 --> 2:09:37.060]  back go well the idea is that you nailed you nailed it so correctly Alex this
[2:09:37.060 --> 2:09:42.980]  is a slaughter in the preparation mode okay and we've got to basically make as
[2:09:42.980 --> 2:09:47.340]  many duplicates of copies of your your videos and get them out to everybody but
[2:09:47.340 --> 2:09:51.300]  here's the thing I think that people need to understand well there is yet a
[2:09:51.300 --> 2:09:55.420]  whisper of time to make a difference you've got to seriously write your
[2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:59.220]  Senators Congress women scream at the top your logs write editorials get on
[2:09:59.220 --> 2:10:05.100]  cocktails and demand Janet Napolitano's resignation now here's why I say that
[2:10:05.100 --> 2:10:09.260]  when these guys and they test they always take it's three you know steps
[2:10:09.260 --> 2:10:12.660]  forward two steps backward but they still end up a step ahead at the end of the
[2:10:12.660 --> 2:10:18.020]  day the idea that all returning vets would be painted with terrace brush and
[2:10:18.020 --> 2:10:21.740]  Alex we need to cover this the reason the definition of terrorism is being
[2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:25.980]  broadened is so that under the terrorism rule you will be denied dude you'll be
[2:10:25.980 --> 2:10:30.580]  denied due process and all those issues that you've talked about the bar on your
[2:10:30.580 --> 2:10:35.180]  shows this is where we're headed ladies and gentlemen and and it's everybody but
[2:10:35.180 --> 2:10:39.500]  them Alex and that's what I think is the missing link in our conversations with
[2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:42.980]  all the listening audience and all the audience that's viewing your taste
[2:10:42.980 --> 2:10:46.340]  videos listening to you and I around the world and by the way the rest of the
[2:10:46.340 --> 2:10:50.500]  world sees what's going on in retrospect I'm getting half a dozen emails a day
[2:10:50.500 --> 2:10:53.060]  from people all around the world that listen to you listen to I would that
[2:10:53.060 --> 2:10:57.220]  people put us up on YouTube you're up on YouTube I'm up on YouTube but the deal
[2:10:57.220 --> 2:11:02.460]  is that people have got to understand this is when you've drawn the attention
[2:11:02.460 --> 2:11:07.700]  of the world's population to the occult nature of the Illuminati and the
[2:11:07.700 --> 2:11:11.740]  Bohemian Grove and everything I don't think people understand once the blood
[2:11:11.740 --> 2:11:16.060]  begins to flow it does not stop and I can tell you I've talked to the highest
[2:11:16.060 --> 2:11:20.180]  ranking military officials that there are way beyond what most people even know
[2:11:20.180 --> 2:11:25.500]  exist I've talked to people from Northcom I've talked to different individuals and
[2:11:25.500 --> 2:11:28.700]  and all the thing they're saying get ready get ready get ready get ready I
[2:11:28.700 --> 2:11:33.140]  talked to one of the world's lead surveillance providers of equipment to
[2:11:33.140 --> 2:11:37.340]  the government and he said a retired Navy SEAL friend of his said get all the
[2:11:37.340 --> 2:11:40.580]  guns you can't I'm just telling what I'm being told get all the food you can
[2:11:40.580 --> 2:11:44.860]  because very soon the economy is going to be brought to a screeching hold so all
[2:11:44.860 --> 2:11:50.100]  this yippie-skippy feel-good talk that's out there coming well things have
[2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:55.420]  turned around oh really what's changed what is what has changed so dramatically
[2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:59.820]  that things have turned around the idea Alex at the bio event or nuclear event
[2:11:59.820 --> 2:12:04.340]  very soon now here's the thing that people got to realize that list that was
[2:12:04.340 --> 2:12:10.020]  posted especially but that you went into great detail with the that we talked
[2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:14.300]  about together you talked about separately is absolutely the hit piece
[2:12:14.300 --> 2:12:19.380]  for billifying a group of people who will be blamed for what is going to be
[2:12:19.380 --> 2:12:24.820]  initiated in this country and because the events are going to be so horrific
[2:12:24.820 --> 2:12:29.220]  and so awesome when I say awesome not in a good sense but just so overwhelmingly
[2:12:29.220 --> 2:12:33.820]  wicked and evil people will do anything they'll clamor they'll they'll they'll
[2:12:33.820 --> 2:12:39.620]  scamper they'll absolutely run in in total amazement at the level of
[2:12:39.620 --> 2:12:43.740]  devastation because again when you and I have detailed the globalist plan to take
[2:12:43.740 --> 2:12:47.940]  the population of world down from six some six billion to 500 million they're
[2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:52.820]  serious about that and I want to share something else the idea that we're being
[2:12:52.820 --> 2:12:57.340]  told anything close to the truth you've got to get through your mind ladies and
[2:12:57.340 --> 2:13:02.780]  gentlemen that there is no truth coming out of mainstream news did you see
[2:13:02.780 --> 2:13:09.740]  Anderson Cooper you know mocking in his gay overtones the the entire tea bag
[2:13:09.740 --> 2:13:12.820]  movement you know that's not what it's called but that that means something
[2:13:12.820 --> 2:13:17.620]  they're now saying anyone on MSNBC on show after show it's a talking point who
[2:13:17.620 --> 2:13:23.340]  protests the banks hates black people so they're trying to stir up race war they're
[2:13:23.340 --> 2:13:28.540]  creating division and that's their talking point you're a neo-nazi if you
[2:13:28.540 --> 2:13:32.340]  don't like the bankers or you're a rightly extremists when it's the majority
[2:13:32.340 --> 2:13:36.540]  98% of people in polls are against the bankers they're making their move and
[2:13:36.540 --> 2:13:40.540]  Steve as you know they have now called for what we knew they were going to do
[2:13:40.540 --> 2:13:44.260]  and predicted they would do on record they're going to make it public stock
[2:13:44.260 --> 2:13:48.620]  the money the federal government put in the banks is going to be public stock
[2:13:48.620 --> 2:13:52.980]  that means it's being stolen completely absolutely and this is the thing that
[2:13:52.980 --> 2:13:57.220]  people don't understand money always is transferred from weak hands to strong
[2:13:57.220 --> 2:14:02.900]  hands and the powerhouse now and I said this ten years ago I said China will be
[2:14:02.900 --> 2:14:07.020]  built up the Chinese economy will become the greatest economy in the world at
[2:14:07.020 --> 2:14:11.020]  the expense of the American economy our technology our entire banking system
[2:14:11.020 --> 2:14:13.820]  will ship to the east and obviously that's what Jimmy Rogers and the fan
[2:14:13.820 --> 2:14:17.780]  for yours too but the thing that people don't understand is this is a
[2:14:17.780 --> 2:14:23.820]  blueprinted destruction of the American way of life that's why they pay listen
[2:14:23.820 --> 2:14:26.540]  I mean I hate to interrupt but you're right that folks you're not just saying
[2:14:26.540 --> 2:14:30.660]  this that's why they pay tax incentives to leave that's why only the US and
[2:14:30.660 --> 2:14:34.580]  Western Europe and Canada and Australia New Zealand have to do the carbon cuts
[2:14:34.580 --> 2:14:38.140]  they're saying in the next two to ten years are phasing in over the next ten
[2:14:38.140 --> 2:14:42.540]  that will destroy what's left of our industry China and India don't have to
[2:14:42.540 --> 2:14:48.180]  make those cuts this is designed to shut us down go ahead well I think the best
[2:14:48.180 --> 2:14:51.740]  example that is the credit up the ask what's going on with credit cards and
[2:14:51.740 --> 2:14:55.540]  by the way information came into me I think over the weekend that Chase was
[2:14:55.540 --> 2:14:58.660]  down on their credit card processing from people that actually worked for
[2:14:58.660 --> 2:15:03.740]  Chase so I think that what people have got to understand is look the we were
[2:15:03.740 --> 2:15:09.220]  all sold of this bill of goods called what would you call it forever
[2:15:09.220 --> 2:15:13.860]  forever prosperity or prosperity forever and just that the houses would never go
[2:15:13.860 --> 2:15:18.300]  down your job is secure blah blah blah blah blah and go out and borrow 125% of
[2:15:18.300 --> 2:15:22.620]  your house your house or your home's value what people don't understand is
[2:15:22.620 --> 2:15:28.140]  the court this is what's important when when actual Rothschild made the statement
[2:15:28.140 --> 2:15:31.300]  give me control of the nation's money and I care not who writes its laws
[2:15:31.300 --> 2:15:35.580]  Jesus said the love of money is a rid of all evil and I'm saying that they who
[2:15:35.580 --> 2:15:40.140]  control the money control the evil look at it now change from those evil
[2:15:40.140 --> 2:15:44.180]  bankers that are caught literally you know with their five hundred million
[2:15:44.180 --> 2:15:47.580]  dollar golden parachutes and now it's all the Patriots fault and we're all a
[2:15:47.580 --> 2:15:53.700]  bunch of racist Alex I used to write extensively on Cold War scenarios for
[2:15:53.700 --> 2:15:57.340]  war given the access I was given to different documents and people over
[2:15:57.340 --> 2:16:01.540]  the years and I have sat down with double agents both the United States
[2:16:01.540 --> 2:16:05.860]  government and former Russian agents after the break of Soviet Union in public
[2:16:05.860 --> 2:16:09.860]  and they said you Americans are so stupid we're going to steal your country now I'm
[2:16:09.860 --> 2:16:14.460]  not just saying this is a Russian thing and you we're going to generate a civil
[2:16:14.460 --> 2:16:19.020]  war now if you look at it and they said and and even even people who have have
[2:16:19.020 --> 2:16:22.700]  argued against you in all these years now they can't deny it when they're out of a
[2:16:22.700 --> 2:16:26.740]  job when they're for once 201k or whatever it's half of what it's worth
[2:16:26.740 --> 2:16:30.380]  and then by the way 60 minutes did a piece on that I've told people you've
[2:16:30.380 --> 2:16:34.460]  told people look they've got to get out of 401ks or IRAs but the same group of
[2:16:34.460 --> 2:16:40.100]  sinister scumbag international elitists are sucking the last dollars out of the
[2:16:40.100 --> 2:16:43.740]  American population pocket by saying oh what a buying opportunity what a
[2:16:43.740 --> 2:16:46.740]  bottom line you're gonna have Gerald Solante on the next hour aren't you
[2:16:46.740 --> 2:16:51.380]  yes and Gerald has as said look at it's going to be revolution of streets and
[2:16:51.380 --> 2:16:54.860]  the thing that's important for people understand the ladies and gentlemen I
[2:16:54.860 --> 2:17:00.620]  use the term whisper of time left and the the point is that you have got to
[2:17:00.620 --> 2:17:04.700]  stand up you can't just count on Alex Jones well you can you can't just count
[2:17:04.700 --> 2:17:07.900]  on me and all the other voices out there it's got to be your voice and I'm
[2:17:07.900 --> 2:17:13.900]  serious Alex every single veteran should be writing a letter to their
[2:17:13.900 --> 2:17:19.220]  congressman senator demanding Janet Napolitano's resignation let me stop you
[2:17:19.220 --> 2:17:23.700]  it's not that they even so much listen it's a trial balloon they admit this
[2:17:23.700 --> 2:17:27.700]  they're always testing things out of Obama said a month ago we're gonna put
[2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:31.500]  satellite tracker boxes in all your cars and taxing by the mile the public said
[2:17:31.500 --> 2:17:36.460]  no they backed off but they're still gonna try it later they do this on every
[2:17:36.460 --> 2:17:40.900]  single issue like he's saying I don't want to ban all your guns now it's too
[2:17:40.900 --> 2:17:44.660]  politically unpopular and then his own people snicker in Congress yeah we've
[2:17:44.660 --> 2:17:49.860]  got a rob them all first and it is the fact imagine you're the globalist they
[2:17:49.860 --> 2:17:53.140]  want to bring the US down it's always been their main target they've uses an
[2:17:53.140 --> 2:17:55.740]  engine of the new world order now they're done with us what do they do about
[2:17:55.740 --> 2:17:59.580]  a hundred million gun owners they use that against us they can't march out
[2:17:59.580 --> 2:18:04.220]  against us so they destroy the economy crime breaks down society breaks down
[2:18:04.220 --> 2:18:08.820]  the military is already trained and ready to go out on the streets then they
[2:18:08.820 --> 2:18:12.380]  stayed shootouts between patriots in the military they send the military into
[2:18:12.380 --> 2:18:16.660]  missions where the patriots will fight them then the globalist main enemy that
[2:18:16.660 --> 2:18:20.020]  I've been saying for years and now it's public news the military and the
[2:18:20.020 --> 2:18:25.020]  American people kill each other that's that's what three-dimensional real
[2:18:25.020 --> 2:18:29.540]  chess in the new world order is all about they are divide and conquer divide
[2:18:29.540 --> 2:18:33.220]  and conquer at multi-levels everything they do is divide liberal for a
[2:18:33.220 --> 2:18:38.020]  conservative black from white everything they do is divide the military from the
[2:18:38.020 --> 2:18:41.700]  people you know police from the people so they can play us off against each
[2:18:41.700 --> 2:18:46.460]  other while they sit back offshore and do it Steve what do we do then knowing
[2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:49.900]  they're running a psi op and how they're hyping the rioting and all of this and
[2:18:49.900 --> 2:18:53.580]  pushing it well the brotherhood of darkness cannot stand the light but
[2:18:53.580 --> 2:18:57.700]  even more than that there is the ability to resist you know the Bible says resist
[2:18:57.700 --> 2:19:01.380]  the devil and he will flee first thing you people forgot to understand and you
[2:19:01.380 --> 2:19:06.500]  built this case so many years alec is that this is a supernatural Lucifer
[2:19:06.500 --> 2:19:13.180]  worshipping a cadre of intensely evil people and you can't even put evil in
[2:19:13.180 --> 2:19:17.100]  the context of the standard understanding is basically a thousand Sith
[2:19:17.100 --> 2:19:22.980]  lords well absolutely and and let that I'd add on steroids okay yes because
[2:19:22.980 --> 2:19:27.260]  because again the thing that we've got to realize and not only realizes this
[2:19:27.260 --> 2:19:33.100]  they can be held back what they can be stopped or not you and I both know if
[2:19:33.100 --> 2:19:38.340]  they go to their dirty deed that bag of tricks and and use a hyper plague and

[2:24:02.900 --> 2:24:11.260]  Steve quail we know since at least the late 1970s everything the federal
[2:24:11.260 --> 2:24:15.100]  government has done is prepare for massive emergencies and taking over
[2:24:15.100 --> 2:24:21.020]  county and city governments John Ward and fence authorization act PDD 51 and
[2:24:21.020 --> 2:24:26.620]  others clearly state that the attack is based on the governors and the Congress
[2:24:26.620 --> 2:24:31.140]  that the government will that the illegitimate national security counsel
[2:24:31.140 --> 2:24:34.220]  as the Washington Post reported last month is basically already in a
[2:24:34.220 --> 2:24:39.140]  dictatorship through North com through space command which is there's a real
[2:24:39.140 --> 2:24:41.980]  space command but the public is even aware of it even though it's published
[2:24:41.980 --> 2:24:47.580]  this is the real government they're gearing up for bird flu we know that
[2:24:47.580 --> 2:24:51.820]  they put it in the vaccines in Europe shipped it all over the world suddenly
[2:24:51.820 --> 2:24:55.380]  we're getting broiders and London telegraph articles about people dying
[2:24:55.380 --> 2:25:00.620]  being given the vaccine weird trials where they tell people it's one shot and
[2:25:00.620 --> 2:25:06.780]  give it to them and they die do you think we're really coming up to the point
[2:25:06.780 --> 2:25:12.620]  where they're gonna do it because in my gut I've never been so upset absolutely
[2:25:12.620 --> 2:25:17.220]  and Alex I think the time may have already been telegraphed by FEMA you
[2:25:17.220 --> 2:25:21.140]  know their national level exercise that's coming on through the 27th to 31st of
[2:25:21.140 --> 2:25:26.740]  July are you familiar with that yes and the situation that's going to be
[2:25:26.740 --> 2:25:30.020]  telling on that I think most people need to understand that tell folks about it
[2:25:30.020 --> 2:25:34.620]  man I'll be aware okay well the the FEMA national level exercise is going to go
[2:25:34.620 --> 2:25:40.100]  on throughout the country and it's all scaled around domestic terrorism now why
[2:25:40.100 --> 2:25:44.420]  this is critical is because command control and communication is the key
[2:25:44.420 --> 2:25:49.340]  and during an exercise you and I have always cautioned and most people are
[2:25:49.340 --> 2:25:52.860]  alert enough that listen to us to know now that when there is an exercise
[2:25:52.860 --> 2:25:57.980]  taking place it could be a cover for the real thing yeah when back in 2000 they
[2:25:57.980 --> 2:26:01.900]  released the weaponized foot and mouth they later admitted accidentally out of
[2:26:01.900 --> 2:26:05.100]  out of port and down in England they were doing an exercise around the
[2:26:05.100 --> 2:26:08.540]  country and then magically it popped up in a two-day period where they were
[2:26:08.540 --> 2:26:12.460]  doing the exercise absolutely and so the thing that's important for everyone
[2:26:12.460 --> 2:26:17.380]  to recognize it only takes one command word from North com to change it from
[2:26:17.380 --> 2:26:21.500]  an exercise into full-scale implementation now Alex I've been
[2:26:21.500 --> 2:26:24.500]  talking to too many people in the background about Henry Kissinger's
[2:26:24.500 --> 2:26:29.260]  statement about there will be no private firearms ownership in the United
[2:26:29.260 --> 2:26:33.500]  States after September this year so if it's going to take thirty sixty days to
[2:26:33.500 --> 2:26:36.740]  slaughter everybody they're going to slaughter and you know I get a lot of
[2:26:36.740 --> 2:26:41.540]  blackout like when I talk about this but I can tell you point blank is that
[2:26:41.540 --> 2:26:45.660]  right now we're seeing that quelling are the ending of all First Amendment rights
[2:26:45.660 --> 2:26:50.860]  period okay and now it's getting we know the government's wargaming attacking
[2:26:50.860 --> 2:26:55.020]  people systems of the internet in which a Rockefeller saying we we'd be better
[2:26:55.020 --> 2:27:00.100]  off without the internet absolutely and I think the thing is is that and I want
[2:27:00.100 --> 2:27:05.620]  to share this I'm going to be posting today later on orange alert and it's
[2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:09.140]  going to basically make the appeal to everyone who's taking their oath of
[2:27:09.140 --> 2:27:12.860]  office and I know you've had the oathkeepers I had guy on and stuff but
[2:27:12.860 --> 2:27:16.660]  what I don't think people understand is that over the next several months
[2:27:16.660 --> 2:27:21.060]  law enforcement and the military are going to be given unlawful illegal orders
[2:27:21.060 --> 2:27:25.380]  and unconstitutional orders to round up and purge dissidents against all the
[2:27:25.380 --> 2:27:28.740]  New World Order crowd now you've never talked like this Steve you're saying
[2:27:28.740 --> 2:27:33.620]  you believe they're preparing to move how do we are how do we short circuit them
[2:27:33.620 --> 2:27:38.260]  doing that well first of all we know for a fact that we've been able to short
[2:27:38.260 --> 2:27:43.180]  circuit by exposing this stuff okay now all I know as Alex I believe we're buying
[2:27:43.180 --> 2:27:47.260]  time we're buying time for people to get prepared but the fact is is that the
[2:27:47.260 --> 2:27:51.380]  red list and the red list is still a real issue you know it's funny isn't it
[2:27:51.380 --> 2:27:55.660]  that I do we've been getting they now have the no fly list with over a
[2:27:55.660 --> 2:27:59.340]  million 100,000 totally innocent people on it and now they're saying that's
[2:27:59.340 --> 2:28:03.900]  going to be a no buy list go ahead you got it see it goes from no fly to no buy
[2:28:03.900 --> 2:28:07.140]  and also let me share this all the global stuff how to do is stop the
[2:28:07.140 --> 2:28:11.420]  importation of goods and that's why you know obviously we're seeing guns and
[2:28:11.420 --> 2:28:15.500]  we're seeing firearms and ammunition short supply blah blah blah but it goes
[2:28:15.500 --> 2:28:19.460]  all the way through the whole system people are saying they go to this mark
[2:28:19.460 --> 2:28:25.140]  the military refuses to sell its brass now to the gun manufacturers for ammo I've
[2:28:25.140 --> 2:28:29.660]  got if you just google homeland security visits gun owner thousands of hits I did
[2:28:29.660 --> 2:28:34.180]  it yesterday you bought a thousand rounds why Homeland Security secret police
[2:28:34.180 --> 2:28:37.580]  arresting people who bought a few thousand rounds of ammo saying it's an
[2:28:37.580 --> 2:28:41.220]  arsenal when it's not even against the law go ahead right and I want to share
[2:28:41.220 --> 2:28:45.580]  this people are noticing and I'm getting massive amounts of data telling us that
[2:28:45.580 --> 2:28:50.420]  checkpoints are are being set up on the on and off ramps especially in Virginia
[2:28:50.420 --> 2:28:55.260]  south of Washington DC now these are new things out even up here in Montana you
[2:28:55.260 --> 2:28:59.580]  know we're we're about probably 40 to 50 miles between any city if you've got a
[2:28:59.580 --> 2:29:03.540]  regular army popping up when governors say that you're not allowed to do this
[2:29:03.540 --> 2:29:08.900]  the intent is see the army still comes out yep and and again the thing is is
[2:29:08.900 --> 2:29:11.780]  that what I'm saying is I believe we have the real debt now listen here's the
[2:29:11.780 --> 2:29:15.860]  other thing I'm telling everybody and I want to make this clear and I can't
[2:29:15.860 --> 2:29:20.580]  go into detail but you can read between the lines the idea ladies and gentlemen
[2:29:20.580 --> 2:29:26.420]  that if veterans are billified to ultimately be liquidated then you've
[2:29:26.420 --> 2:29:31.780]  got to understand those with special qualifications are going to be the ones
[2:29:31.780 --> 2:29:35.340]  in the first site so I'm telling all former combat veterans special forces
[2:29:35.340 --> 2:29:41.820]  Green Berets Delta and special special operations personnel who are out of the
[2:29:41.820 --> 2:29:45.820]  service that they must change their physical location now I'm telling you
[2:29:45.820 --> 2:29:50.580]  there's a reason why the for a long time and I don't think people understand
[2:29:50.580 --> 2:29:56.780]  stay there stay there we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones and the

[2:34:01.380 --> 2:34:04.260]  the government tells you and these are of course preachers that have been
[2:34:04.260 --> 2:34:05.820]  speaking out against the government
[2:34:05.820 --> 2:34:09.100]  i mean steve this is a secret police this is a criminal
[2:34:09.100 --> 2:34:12.820]  government that knows it's about to do even more horrible things so it's
[2:34:12.820 --> 2:34:15.860]  trying to get everybody to stand down
[2:34:15.860 --> 2:34:18.740]  but then they know it's going to blow up in the rebellion and then they're going
[2:34:18.740 --> 2:34:20.580]  to call everybody that's standing up
[2:34:20.580 --> 2:34:21.880]  terrorist
[2:34:21.880 --> 2:34:25.300]  my god this is going to be a horrible situation steve
[2:34:25.300 --> 2:34:29.380]  but i mean police military former special forces
[2:34:29.380 --> 2:34:31.940]  uh... you're really saying the government's going to come after them i
[2:34:31.940 --> 2:34:34.020]  mean where they're going to get these forces
[2:34:34.020 --> 2:34:37.340]  in the first wave i see him playing us off against each other
[2:34:37.340 --> 2:34:39.740]  in the first wave to society breaks down
[2:34:39.740 --> 2:34:42.940]  then going into the red and blue list but but you say you've got other intel
[2:34:42.940 --> 2:34:43.700]  go ahead
[2:34:43.700 --> 2:34:48.140]  got other intel and let me share this it comes from the highest realms of the
[2:34:48.140 --> 2:34:50.220]  military themselves and it comes from
[2:34:50.220 --> 2:34:53.820]  some of the best place sources and when i say this you know look
[2:34:53.820 --> 2:34:58.260]  the deal is alex is that the hunter killer teams are coming nato has been
[2:34:58.260 --> 2:34:59.900]  brought in this country member when
[2:34:59.900 --> 2:35:04.100]  secretary defense gate said that they may need to call on nato to bring in troops
[2:35:04.100 --> 2:35:06.660]  we were deployed all over the world we told people
[2:35:06.660 --> 2:35:09.980]  that was a plan to deploy u.s. troops will be loyal to the united states are
[2:35:09.980 --> 2:35:10.580]  old
[2:35:10.580 --> 2:35:12.260]  depend the constitution bill of rights
[2:35:12.260 --> 2:35:14.460]  and to bring in nato troops
[2:35:14.460 --> 2:35:19.180]  there are agencies that specifically do nothing but what we monitor at the
[2:35:19.180 --> 2:35:20.140]  where
[2:35:20.140 --> 2:35:24.020]  of the uh... of the whereabouts of all these different individuals and i don't
[2:35:24.020 --> 2:35:27.180]  always know that i mean they constantly spy on the vets
[2:35:27.180 --> 2:35:30.340]  who think that doing all these black ops the government loves them they
[2:35:30.340 --> 2:35:34.500]  hate you because they know you're going to resist when they try the soviet style
[2:35:34.500 --> 2:35:35.780]  purge go ahead
[2:35:35.780 --> 2:35:38.940]  right and i think that that we know they could have called us about
[2:35:38.940 --> 2:35:41.860]  bs brokers or whatever they've called me worse than that i'm sure you had it
[2:35:41.860 --> 2:35:43.420]  worse than that but the point is
[2:35:43.420 --> 2:35:44.900]  the pilot panel
[2:35:44.900 --> 2:35:48.780]  basically validated everything that you and i've been warning about for these
[2:35:48.780 --> 2:35:50.860]  past fifteen ten years whatever
[2:35:50.860 --> 2:35:52.620]  the point is ladies and gentlemen
[2:35:52.620 --> 2:35:54.100]  how dare they
[2:35:54.100 --> 2:35:58.020]  bill of five a group of men and women who would lay down their lives for their
[2:35:58.020 --> 2:35:58.980]  country
[2:35:58.980 --> 2:36:03.260]  and then turn them into the enemy with the same brushes all those gun owners of
[2:36:03.260 --> 2:36:05.220]  the constitution of those patriots of
[2:36:05.220 --> 2:36:10.100]  right wing terrorist blah blah blah if we don't come and a lawsuit a
[2:36:10.100 --> 2:36:12.420]  multi-faceted lawsuit
[2:36:12.420 --> 2:36:15.620]  against the uh... and i'm telling you these are hate crimes ladies and
[2:36:15.620 --> 2:36:16.340]  gentlemen
[2:36:16.340 --> 2:36:18.620]  their totalitarian hate crimes
[2:36:18.620 --> 2:36:21.780]  and they are violating your civil rights and i would be violating your
[2:36:21.780 --> 2:36:26.620]  civil civil rights there and that's what alex at the napolitano document
[2:36:26.620 --> 2:36:29.820]  has so little by the execution warrants that are already
[2:36:29.820 --> 2:36:33.860]  issue and it shows there the bad guys i mean the of the look foreign banks are
[2:36:33.860 --> 2:36:34.620]  looting
[2:36:34.620 --> 2:36:36.780]  the gdp in six months
[2:36:36.780 --> 2:36:40.620]  the whole all the production of the country stolen in half a year
[2:36:40.620 --> 2:36:42.060]  for an entire year
[2:36:42.060 --> 2:36:45.540]  uh... they are just running rampant stealing everything all the old the
[2:36:45.540 --> 2:36:48.140]  only reason i think you may be right they may go hot
[2:36:48.140 --> 2:36:52.260]  and sooner rather than later steven let's forget the word out like our lives
[2:36:52.260 --> 2:36:55.140]  is because all the rich people for three years have been leaving the united
[2:36:55.140 --> 2:36:56.620]  states i mean the billionaires
[2:36:56.620 --> 2:37:00.060]  and i don't know what i've talked to him a lot of money in austin
[2:37:00.060 --> 2:37:01.220]  and uh...
[2:37:01.220 --> 2:37:04.220]  and then and then and they're freaked out themselves don't know yeah you don't
[2:37:04.220 --> 2:37:05.060]  know the elite
[2:37:05.060 --> 2:37:08.460]  i'm getting a lot of you know yeah there won't even be in america and i go
[2:37:08.460 --> 2:37:10.660]  what do you mean there won't be in america
[2:37:10.660 --> 2:37:12.820]  and they just said there won't be in america
[2:37:12.820 --> 2:37:16.380]  i don't know what that means but i i just can't believe they're doing this
[2:37:16.380 --> 2:37:19.540]  well here and they are doing it alexand the problem is that
[2:37:19.540 --> 2:37:23.140]  when it becomes so in your face it's one thing to warn about it for years or
[2:37:23.140 --> 2:37:24.820]  decade or decade and a half
[2:37:24.820 --> 2:37:27.720]  it's nothing when everything you've warned about is now present on your
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:28.540]  plate
[2:37:28.540 --> 2:37:32.660]  now also the feds are going to tell the military and law enforcement people
[2:37:32.660 --> 2:37:36.460]  to send their families to so-called faith zone and they're going to say that
[2:37:36.460 --> 2:37:39.260]  we're going to have a little bit
[2:37:39.260 --> 2:37:41.820]  see this is key and i've always had this thought and researched it and i was
[2:37:41.820 --> 2:37:42.900]  pretty good on air
[2:37:42.900 --> 2:37:44.300]  they're going to kill
[2:37:44.300 --> 2:37:46.500]  some of the select police and military
[2:37:46.500 --> 2:37:48.820]  i just differ on how many with you
[2:37:48.820 --> 2:37:51.300]  and then blame it on us sorry
[2:37:51.300 --> 2:37:54.860]  and that's the nature of my orange alert that's going up on my website today
[2:37:54.860 --> 2:37:56.420]  or baby up tomorrow
[2:37:56.420 --> 2:37:57.540]  but here's the deal
[2:37:57.540 --> 2:38:00.940]  understand this alexa military and law enforcement will be
[2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:03.660]  uh... promise the protection of families okay
[2:38:03.660 --> 2:38:07.260]  and then their family members are going to be used as a lever to get them to
[2:38:07.260 --> 2:38:11.220]  comply with the illegal orders to kill u.s. citizens around
[2:38:11.220 --> 2:38:14.580]  them up in family camps and children to remember we were
[2:38:14.580 --> 2:38:18.300]  breaking the info about all these kids will be locked down in schools and move
[2:38:18.300 --> 2:38:20.140]  to safe zones
[2:38:20.140 --> 2:38:23.120]  you do anything to keep your family alive wouldn't you know i remember you
[2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:26.300]  say that twelve thirteen years ago myself reporting and
[2:38:26.300 --> 2:38:27.780]  then we got sent footage
[2:38:27.780 --> 2:38:30.900]  from places like missouri in the ozards where they load the elementary up with
[2:38:30.900 --> 2:38:31.860]  their hands up
[2:38:31.860 --> 2:38:34.580]  on buses without telling them where they were going to take them to a fema
[2:38:34.580 --> 2:38:35.340]  camp
[2:38:35.340 --> 2:38:37.980]  and then call the parents and say you've got to come here to pick them up and it
[2:38:37.980 --> 2:38:38.900]  was admitted
[2:38:38.900 --> 2:38:43.180]  drill and now the news admits during the collapse of society they are going to
[2:38:43.180 --> 2:38:45.860]  have the military and police quote move in
[2:38:45.860 --> 2:38:49.020]  to defended camps for themselves
[2:38:49.020 --> 2:38:51.820]  my god what a sickening plan they've devised
[2:38:51.820 --> 2:38:55.620]  well this is that i think the word sickening satanic diabolic
[2:38:55.620 --> 2:38:56.820]  a luciferian
[2:38:56.820 --> 2:39:00.380]  wickedness and jesus said an alexa recording jesus because when he tells
[2:39:00.380 --> 2:39:01.420]  it like it is
[2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:05.140]  you don't have to question like it is he said there's never been a time like
[2:39:05.140 --> 2:39:06.300]  it in history
[2:39:06.300 --> 2:39:10.220]  nor would be again and i got to tell you that upset me when i even worse than
[2:39:10.220 --> 2:39:11.500]  the days of no
[2:39:11.500 --> 2:39:12.900]  absolutely
[2:39:12.900 --> 2:39:16.340]  and the thing i think that people need to recognize right now
[2:39:16.340 --> 2:39:17.580]  is that look
[2:39:17.580 --> 2:39:21.940]  every girl hope for dreams or future they're earning capacity there everything
[2:39:21.940 --> 2:39:24.940]  that they've uh... worked hard for our life has been
[2:39:24.940 --> 2:39:29.660]  uh... literally taken away from them by the very people that are now using the
[2:39:29.660 --> 2:39:33.340]  media and the mouthpieces and the bomb at brokering horrors
[2:39:33.340 --> 2:39:37.700]  to bill of five i can remember they identify they bill of five they know
[2:39:37.700 --> 2:39:41.860]  of five and now they destroyed and so what i'm telling people i could not be
[2:39:41.860 --> 2:39:42.980]  more serious
[2:39:42.980 --> 2:39:46.940]  the latest of the our demands that people become active they can't let alex
[2:39:46.940 --> 2:39:47.820]  jones do it
[2:39:47.820 --> 2:39:51.820]  they can't let steve quail do it they can't let whoever their favorite or
[2:39:51.820 --> 2:39:55.500]  non-favorite heart ratio they have to do it and see again
[2:39:55.500 --> 2:40:00.620]  well the idea is listen they can even tell of the level of resistance by how
[2:40:00.620 --> 2:40:01.980]  many people
[2:40:01.980 --> 2:40:04.100]  are complained you follow me
[2:40:04.100 --> 2:40:08.420]  yes only a million people complain they go that's a piece of cake and we are
[2:40:08.420 --> 2:40:10.100]  defenses they're testing
[2:40:10.100 --> 2:40:11.460]  our picket line
[2:40:11.460 --> 2:40:15.500]  you got it thank you that's what i was trying to say
[2:40:15.500 --> 2:40:18.660]  that's what i'm trying to say so they're testing the picket line now here's one
[2:40:18.660 --> 2:40:21.500]  thing that everyone can take a great hope in
[2:40:21.500 --> 2:40:25.500]  the thing is that there is a promise and there are promises that they that know
[2:40:25.500 --> 2:40:28.860]  that they're the living god shall be strong and do exploits
[2:40:28.860 --> 2:40:33.740]  there are amazing people alex still in the military that are amazing people
[2:40:33.740 --> 2:40:37.540]  not all of them are sold out to the devil but the problem is and this is the
[2:40:37.540 --> 2:40:38.380]  big issue
[2:40:38.380 --> 2:40:41.660]  i have been told by top-level military brass
[2:40:41.660 --> 2:40:46.100]  that literally the u.s. military assets are going to basically be left in europe
[2:40:46.100 --> 2:40:48.500]  so that the loose appearance and let me share this with you
[2:40:48.500 --> 2:40:51.420]  the whole private hessian army thing
[2:40:51.420 --> 2:40:52.500]  is all
[2:40:52.500 --> 2:40:53.780]  based on the fact
[2:40:53.780 --> 2:40:57.020]  that all the money has been diverted from the regular military notice their
[2:40:57.020 --> 2:40:58.340]  budgets are being cut
[2:40:58.340 --> 2:41:03.020]  but is it amazing that multi-billion-dollar contracts are being given
[2:41:03.020 --> 2:41:07.820]  to defense contractors i.e. blackwater now v and also i don't know there's no
[2:41:07.820 --> 2:41:11.180]  major news articles written there's a major articles written
[2:41:11.180 --> 2:41:14.220]  about how all these big companies have hired their own armies are produced
[2:41:14.220 --> 2:41:15.140]  their own armies
[2:41:15.140 --> 2:41:18.180]  they've been getting ready for a siege mode for decades
[2:41:18.180 --> 2:41:22.460]  hardening their corporate and government facilities to literally shot
[2:41:22.460 --> 2:41:24.980]  that the economy down in a great depression
[2:41:24.980 --> 2:41:28.220]  but now we're not uh... agrarian were not rural
[2:41:28.220 --> 2:41:32.140]  so that that's their main weapon is just shutting everything off go ahead
[2:41:32.140 --> 2:41:34.740]  absolutely and again the situation
[2:41:34.740 --> 2:41:38.220]  uses that listen if if you if you're uh...
[2:41:38.220 --> 2:41:39.020]  taking
[2:41:39.020 --> 2:41:42.900]  uh... assets that should be used to defend the country because what i will i
[2:41:42.900 --> 2:41:44.420]  wish the military would
[2:41:44.420 --> 2:41:47.700]  would understand especially those who still of this country
[2:41:47.700 --> 2:41:51.180]  they basically a lot of the with the multi-star generals of stuff that have
[2:41:51.180 --> 2:41:54.380]  been gone into retirement or portion of retirement etc
[2:41:54.380 --> 2:42:00.620]  they basically are are not aware of the degree of uh... sub-tribuge on the
[2:42:00.620 --> 2:42:05.340]  international financial scene i have contacts alex and both Beijing and
[2:42:05.340 --> 2:42:10.060]  hong kong and they tell me point blank and you can't get any better connected
[2:42:10.060 --> 2:42:15.100]  that most of the bailout money is being sent overseas to buy commodities and a
[2:42:15.100 --> 2:42:19.260]  big story comes on that china's buying all the copper they can China knows
[2:42:19.260 --> 2:42:22.300]  what's getting ready to happen the united states which has been one of the
[2:42:22.300 --> 2:42:27.140]  most amazing producing countries in the world we've exported in the good days
[2:42:27.140 --> 2:42:28.500]  we exported food
[2:42:28.500 --> 2:42:31.860]  uh... we exported our technology we export things that could help people's
[2:42:31.860 --> 2:42:33.020]  lives be better
[2:42:33.020 --> 2:42:36.060]  event the greed monsters from hell show up
[2:42:36.060 --> 2:42:40.020]  and if i were a we're not done just plundering the united states we got a
[2:42:40.020 --> 2:42:41.260]  plunder the planet
[2:42:41.260 --> 2:42:45.860]  and it's planetary plundering on a demonic super natural luciferian level
[2:42:45.860 --> 2:42:47.660]  that's taking place
[2:42:47.660 --> 2:42:50.540]  people you know uh... what i watched let me jump to sixty minutes
[2:42:50.540 --> 2:42:53.980]  what i watched the common theme of all the people that lost
[2:42:53.980 --> 2:42:57.500]  all half the retirement or all the retirement they were too busy to pay
[2:42:57.500 --> 2:42:59.220]  attention alex
[2:42:59.220 --> 2:43:02.300]  they were too busy to pay attention to their future
[2:43:02.300 --> 2:43:05.700]  to their finances because they let somebody else do it do you hear what i'm
[2:43:05.700 --> 2:43:09.260]  saying yes look to you and i could be the only guy to do that's why you've
[2:43:09.260 --> 2:43:11.180]  got a copy with your right
[2:43:11.180 --> 2:43:14.180]  that you think you've got to do everything you can do those of you in
[2:43:14.180 --> 2:43:17.180]  the military they're given an unlawful and unconstitutional order
[2:43:17.180 --> 2:43:20.180]  at the time it's given that's the point you have to deal with it
[2:43:20.180 --> 2:43:23.420]  and i'll let the imaginations of those getting back to some of you said why
[2:43:23.420 --> 2:43:25.220]  special forces delta
[2:43:25.220 --> 2:43:28.580]  all the guys that have specialized training because they can teach others
[2:43:28.580 --> 2:43:30.420]  and this is the thing alex
[2:43:30.420 --> 2:43:31.740]  too many
[2:43:31.740 --> 2:43:35.300]  coincidences right now civil and our criminal investigation division of
[2:43:35.300 --> 2:43:36.060]  military
[2:43:36.060 --> 2:43:39.700]  is investigating couple army death that one of the army hospital well they
[2:43:39.700 --> 2:43:43.180]  killed uh... they're constantly killing the delta force people
[2:43:43.180 --> 2:43:48.140]  when they come back and i saw a report suicides are like ten times i think it
[2:43:48.140 --> 2:43:49.180]  was even higher
[2:43:49.180 --> 2:43:52.820]  i just google record military suicides it was just astronomical
[2:43:52.820 --> 2:43:55.660]  off the charts most of these are suicides
[2:43:55.660 --> 2:43:57.140]  they're killing people
[2:43:57.140 --> 2:44:01.540]  absolutely another big story by c more harsh about a former high-level
[2:44:01.540 --> 2:44:05.740]  u.s. vice president that was hitting heading up the hit squad
[2:44:05.740 --> 2:44:06.900]  absolutely
[2:44:06.900 --> 2:44:07.980]  and so if you don't
[2:44:07.980 --> 2:44:09.860]  ladies and gentlemen here's the thing
[2:44:09.860 --> 2:44:13.100]  here's the thing you've got to do you've got to turn off the bloody tv that
[2:44:13.100 --> 2:44:15.100]  i call it the zombie machine
[2:44:15.100 --> 2:44:19.580]  that's on the machine is a mind-controlling neuro linguistic programming
[2:44:19.580 --> 2:44:23.660]  uh... device that's why they're even bigger out you walk into cost go
[2:44:23.660 --> 2:44:27.220]  you know a hundred tbs basically you know forty fifty inches whatever big
[2:44:27.220 --> 2:44:27.780]  there
[2:44:27.780 --> 2:44:28.740]  right there
[2:44:28.740 --> 2:44:33.020]  being out streaming out but what i don't think i took our tea at fifteen
[2:44:33.020 --> 2:44:34.580]  plus years ago
[2:44:34.580 --> 2:44:38.500]  and they openly admitted there was subliminals in billboards radio
[2:44:38.500 --> 2:44:40.700]  tv all the big productions
[2:44:40.700 --> 2:44:42.660]  and then they admit the flicker rate
[2:44:42.660 --> 2:44:44.940]  the way they put all the different screens on there they'll have like ten
[2:44:44.940 --> 2:44:45.980]  screens behind him
[2:44:45.980 --> 2:44:49.780]  where yours conscious mind can't pick it all up your subconscious mind kicks in
[2:44:49.780 --> 2:44:52.060]  then the info beams right and
[2:44:52.060 --> 2:44:55.220]  i mean that they've got multi-layers of propaganda
[2:44:55.220 --> 2:44:57.700]  and programming and i catch myself
[2:44:57.700 --> 2:45:01.780]  watching obama listing week when he does that perfect cadence windows uh...
[2:45:01.780 --> 2:45:03.700]  uh... they can do it like he does it
[2:45:03.700 --> 2:45:05.300]  and then i read top
[2:45:05.300 --> 2:45:08.300]  neuro linguistic programmers that are you know mainstream scientists working
[2:45:08.300 --> 2:45:09.020]  for government
[2:45:09.020 --> 2:45:11.500]  they say he's a master at it he's up there
[2:45:11.500 --> 2:45:14.620]  literally hypnotizing people
[2:45:14.620 --> 2:45:17.940]  and and this is something again before people booboo
[2:45:17.940 --> 2:45:20.700]  or say all your boat crazy here's the thing
[2:45:20.700 --> 2:45:24.300]  uh... you know the people that were uh... fattened sassy with a heavy
[2:45:24.300 --> 2:45:25.820]  retirement and you know
[2:45:25.820 --> 2:45:29.180]  happening in our house in austin and no worries now they're out on the streets
[2:45:29.180 --> 2:45:32.620]  not in austin but all the major cities united states after south is waiting
[2:45:32.620 --> 2:45:34.620]  gentlemen
[2:45:34.620 --> 2:45:38.820]  isn't that everybody who sought coming in those of us were warning about it way
[2:45:38.820 --> 2:45:39.740]  before
[2:45:39.740 --> 2:45:42.820]  even uh... petership and gerald came on the scene we've been warning about it
[2:45:42.820 --> 2:45:44.660]  but we were always marginalized
[2:45:44.660 --> 2:45:47.620]  now the bottom line is you know that he's out in such a plain sight you know
[2:45:47.620 --> 2:45:49.380]  how if you put the same thing i've heard
[2:45:49.380 --> 2:45:52.220]  there's nothing you can do to stop us that's their threat
[2:45:52.220 --> 2:45:55.500]  they're you know we don't care what you tell it's too late
[2:45:55.500 --> 2:45:59.100]  why remain tain as long as somebody's got breath at the will of the sire
[2:45:59.100 --> 2:46:03.060]  to take their own seriously you know even god says don't don't
[2:46:03.060 --> 2:46:07.460]  they take an old thought haphazardly but your yeas be a near may be made for
[2:46:07.460 --> 2:46:09.460]  any more than that proceeds out of that
[2:46:09.460 --> 2:46:11.660]  that's been simply stated
[2:46:11.660 --> 2:46:15.060]  do you think you know what the something that someone bind themselves to
[2:46:15.060 --> 2:46:19.060]  and so the new post that are being uh... bounced out there you know this
[2:46:19.060 --> 2:46:22.180]  is that under the new administration post will not be taken to the
[2:46:22.180 --> 2:46:25.060]  constitutional project of which i want to make a statement
[2:46:25.060 --> 2:46:28.340]  when the very images of historic christianity
[2:46:28.340 --> 2:46:32.300]  are covered up at the college of georgetown by request of the white
[2:46:32.300 --> 2:46:32.980]  house
[2:46:32.980 --> 2:46:37.180]  and appear in the day is placed over that image on a block banner
[2:46:37.180 --> 2:46:40.180]  and and the president i think is basically
[2:46:40.180 --> 2:46:43.140]  the uh... had in the middle of the pyramid
[2:46:43.140 --> 2:46:46.300]  let me share this what that means let me stop you let me stop you come to new
[2:46:46.300 --> 2:46:47.220]  world order
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:50.460]  look yeah but start over because i want to put that on screen
[2:46:50.460 --> 2:46:52.860]  uh... guys who were present planet dot tv
[2:46:52.860 --> 2:46:55.940]  uh... google uh... georgetown university
[2:46:55.940 --> 2:46:59.020]  uh... a white house request christian images taken down georgetown
[2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:01.020]  university or white house request
[2:47:01.020 --> 2:47:02.620]  uh... removal of christian
[2:47:02.620 --> 2:47:05.620]  and then put it up and show folks the black pyramid exactly
[2:47:05.620 --> 2:47:08.220]  they didn't just remove the cross
[2:47:08.220 --> 2:47:11.860]  they brought in the black pyramid explain to people what that means a
[2:47:11.860 --> 2:47:15.220]  hierarchical mass death here is our
[2:47:15.220 --> 2:47:17.540]  man on the uh... black horse
[2:47:17.540 --> 2:47:19.140]  uh... the man on the white horse
[2:47:19.140 --> 2:47:21.820]  uh... you know it's bringing you death to start over steve
[2:47:21.820 --> 2:47:25.220]  well again that the idea was that prior to
[2:47:25.220 --> 2:47:29.340]  uh... the president speaking at georgetown the request was made uh...
[2:47:29.340 --> 2:47:32.540]  by the white house and by the staffers at all
[2:47:32.540 --> 2:47:34.660]  christian imagery recovered up
[2:47:34.660 --> 2:47:37.340]  knowing that but especially the i h s the
[2:47:37.340 --> 2:47:41.220]  the uh... a very presentation of jesus behind the place that obama would be
[2:47:41.220 --> 2:47:42.220]  speaking
[2:47:42.220 --> 2:47:45.860]  now to put a black pyramid up there the pyramid is the ultimate
[2:47:45.860 --> 2:47:48.740]  go to your dollar bill a gentleman the new world order
[2:47:48.740 --> 2:47:52.740]  basically alex what that went with and i'm telling the luciferian
[2:47:52.740 --> 2:47:55.140]  symbology is the old
[2:47:55.140 --> 2:47:57.820]  epic or the old days are over
[2:47:57.820 --> 2:48:00.060]  gone to the state states right
[2:48:00.060 --> 2:48:02.940]  comes up the new deliverer okay
[2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:05.860]  it's not enough to just put that imagery up there the
[2:48:05.860 --> 2:48:09.980]  the ramification is that all bomb is typing are being typed with the all
[2:48:09.980 --> 2:48:11.620]  seeing i on the pyramid
[2:48:11.620 --> 2:48:14.420]  the i of course they told our u s
[2:48:14.420 --> 2:48:18.860]  and not only that that's probably the most in your face lap against heaven book
[2:48:18.860 --> 2:48:20.340]  i'm not privy to the
[2:48:20.340 --> 2:48:23.580]  conversations going on in heaven right now i'm not being a wise guy when i'm
[2:48:23.580 --> 2:48:24.460]  saying this
[2:48:24.460 --> 2:48:29.460]  but of all the insults that i think could ever be levied against the lord jesus
[2:48:29.460 --> 2:48:32.820]  christ that has to be one of the most dramatic now let me share this to the
[2:48:32.820 --> 2:48:33.940]  people
[2:48:33.940 --> 2:48:38.140]  a man who is superstitious obama carries talismans in his pocket he paid
[2:48:38.140 --> 2:48:39.460]  paper that into the
[2:48:39.460 --> 2:48:43.140]  the uh... of a report you remember that he had a little monkey god named hanuman
[2:48:43.140 --> 2:48:47.500]  he carries the same talismans are remembered the big sports team owner
[2:48:47.500 --> 2:48:48.940]  uh... in men first
[2:48:48.940 --> 2:48:51.980]  and those rumors there were little talismans up in a pyramid up in the
[2:48:51.980 --> 2:48:53.340]  top of the pyramid
[2:48:53.340 --> 2:48:55.420]  yet we have the news articles
[2:48:55.420 --> 2:48:59.020]  when they opened it up it's the same talismans that obama carries they put
[2:48:59.020 --> 2:49:00.460]  it in time in newsweek
[2:49:00.460 --> 2:49:04.860]  these are high satanic talismans so exactly it isn't just go get that jesus
[2:49:04.860 --> 2:49:08.260]  out from behind me he believed that would lessen his power go ahead
[2:49:08.260 --> 2:49:11.260]  yeah and now you nailed it it's power alex
[2:49:11.260 --> 2:49:14.740]  power is the quintess book i've known billionaires i've known billionaires
[2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:15.980]  i've talked to people that
[2:49:15.980 --> 2:49:18.980]  that uh... i i don't know you the trillionaires but i know the people that
[2:49:18.980 --> 2:49:20.340]  work for the trillionaires
[2:49:20.340 --> 2:49:22.100]  but but i'm not a trillionaires
[2:49:22.100 --> 2:49:26.780]  that thing is that that when you take a talisman you are invoking the power of
[2:49:26.780 --> 2:49:27.540]  that
[2:49:27.540 --> 2:49:31.220]  and the invocation of the power you know the last person do that in history
[2:49:31.220 --> 2:49:32.460]  on a major level
[2:49:32.460 --> 2:49:33.180]  hitler
[2:49:33.180 --> 2:49:36.380]  yeah it worked and he did it in berlin and ladies and gentlemen if you want to
[2:49:36.380 --> 2:49:39.180]  read a great book read the third rike in the occult
[2:49:39.180 --> 2:49:42.300]  because again what i'm saying alex is this
[2:49:42.300 --> 2:49:46.580]  even in the bible when evil spirits are cast out they go and seek someone else
[2:49:46.580 --> 2:49:48.100]  to possess okay
[2:49:48.100 --> 2:49:52.140]  i wonder personally where that spirit that left hitler was
[2:49:52.140 --> 2:49:55.740]  when i saw who was speaking in berlin i didn't have to wonder anymore well you
[2:49:55.740 --> 2:49:59.340]  know he really he literally went to hitler's favorite speaking spot
[2:49:59.340 --> 2:50:00.420]  you've got it
[2:50:00.420 --> 2:50:04.860]  and behind him was a state of of this uh... what was it called the uh...
[2:50:04.860 --> 2:50:07.780]  all good night to see the state and that she spoke about in the book of
[2:50:07.780 --> 2:50:08.820]  revelation
[2:50:08.820 --> 2:50:11.680]  and the actual i don't know if you know this but it would have resided in
[2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:15.660]  forgot pergamos which is in turkey it was brought to the berlin museum and a
[2:50:15.660 --> 2:50:19.660]  copy of it was literally behind him as he spoke to berlin
[2:50:19.660 --> 2:50:21.340]  no i didn't know that
[2:50:21.340 --> 2:50:23.900]  well i think this is the thing i was it's amazing
[2:50:23.900 --> 2:50:26.620]  how many years you've been talking about the bohemian growth of the bohemian
[2:50:26.620 --> 2:50:27.140]  growth
[2:50:27.140 --> 2:50:29.220]  the occult nature of the illuminati
[2:50:29.220 --> 2:50:33.060]  and i have such a luministic symbols right from your face
[2:50:33.060 --> 2:50:34.380]  i gotta tell you brother
[2:50:34.380 --> 2:50:36.420]  i don't know if there are any
[2:50:36.420 --> 2:50:40.020]  seriously i don't know if the thing that makes me curious is the ministers in
[2:50:40.020 --> 2:50:40.860]  this country
[2:50:40.860 --> 2:50:44.460]  that should be speaking the truth are now being castigated castrated
[2:50:44.460 --> 2:50:47.700]  and silent by the world i mean i mean you know what we've got a lot of atheists
[2:50:47.700 --> 2:50:51.220]  and agnostic listening even if they don't believe in god our point is
[2:50:51.220 --> 2:50:54.540]  as a scientific historical fact the elites do
[2:50:54.540 --> 2:50:57.460]  and they believe in satan and destruction and blood
[2:50:57.460 --> 2:50:59.140]  i mean it's a fact
[2:50:59.140 --> 2:51:02.020]  look out

[2:55:51.340 --> 2:55:55.660]  before I sign off with you we're getting reports from all over the country that
[2:55:55.660 --> 2:55:59.940]  census takers are showing up but they're not showing up at every home in the
[2:55:59.940 --> 2:56:04.780]  neighborhood they're selectively showing up and taking GPS readings they seem to
[2:56:04.780 --> 2:56:10.980]  be going off another list and somebody that had this happen said he and his
[2:56:10.980 --> 2:56:14.580]  neighbor are both gun owners and they were the only two in the neighborhood
[2:56:14.580 --> 2:56:19.860]  that had that happen now of course they could be going off the ATF form 4's or
[2:56:19.860 --> 2:56:25.340]  4473's or whatever you know is filed with whomever but I suggest ladies and
[2:56:25.340 --> 2:56:32.260]  gentlemen that you do not identify vilify and to make them the the brunt of
[2:56:32.260 --> 2:56:36.540]  all the world's evil like Janet Napolitano did and without the object
[2:56:36.540 --> 2:56:39.980]  all ultimate object of being the destruction of everyone and Alex I
[2:56:39.980 --> 2:56:44.700]  agree with you we buy every second of time we can for people we buy every
[2:56:44.700 --> 2:56:49.540]  minute every hour every day is one more moment of God's infinite mercy
[2:56:49.540 --> 2:56:53.700]  pleading with people to see what's coming down you know listen when when the
[2:56:53.700 --> 2:56:58.100]  God is out there those who worship Satan are to figure out that obviously if
[2:56:58.100 --> 2:57:02.260]  Satan hates God and Satan identifies that God Christians and Jesus are his
[2:57:02.260 --> 2:57:06.220]  enemies then maybe there's another side to the story besides the one they've
[2:57:06.220 --> 2:57:11.940]  been indoctrinated with all these years Alex we're at the latest point in all
[2:57:11.940 --> 2:57:16.380]  time and given the rhetoric is increasing and I tell you this we know
[2:57:16.380 --> 2:57:20.340]  actions follow rhetoric but ladies and gentlemen if you will step up if you
[2:57:20.340 --> 2:57:25.340]  will absolutely as veterans let your voices be heard and those of you who
[2:57:25.340 --> 2:57:29.660]  will not step up then at least help the veterans financially some of these men
[2:57:29.660 --> 2:57:32.580]  and women who are some of the most amazing men and women in the world are
[2:57:32.580 --> 2:57:36.980]  on the streets or in a flop houses because everybody's abandoned them and
[2:57:36.980 --> 2:57:41.220]  Alex the idea of cutting off veterans benefits has tantamount to executing them
[2:57:41.220 --> 2:57:44.620]  that's why I'm gonna hold you over one more minute take a few calls you got
[2:57:44.620 --> 2:57:50.180]  time for that sure but going back to him saying cover up the name of Jesus in
[2:57:50.180 --> 2:57:53.620]  the church where he was gonna speak I mean politicians have always gone and
[2:57:53.620 --> 2:57:57.020]  spoken at churches even if they're not even Christians right this this is a
[2:57:57.020 --> 2:58:01.380]  message you know they do this on purpose this is a highly religious man
[2:58:01.380 --> 2:58:05.460]  people say he's a Muslim no he's not a Muslim he's a Luciferian right the
[2:58:05.460 --> 2:58:11.500]  promised one has come and if you take the if you understand okay when when the
[2:58:11.500 --> 2:58:14.700]  Illuminous talk about the great one or the promised one they're not talking
[2:58:14.700 --> 2:58:20.620]  about the Messiah they're talking about the literal physical wait a minute
[2:58:20.620 --> 2:58:24.820]  carnation Lucifer on the planet you're saying you believe the Illuminous
[2:58:24.820 --> 2:58:29.500]  believe he is the Antichrist believe that I don't know that he's the Antichrist
[2:58:29.500 --> 2:58:32.940]  but I'm telling you they look at him now remember there's a time in the Bible
[2:58:32.940 --> 2:58:36.580]  where the Antichrist is the Antichrist and then he gets literally possessed by
[2:58:36.580 --> 2:58:43.940]  the devil oh you're saying he's a prototype over I thought thank you for

[3:00:07.140 --> 3:00:10.820]  final segment was Steve quail
[3:00:10.820 --> 3:00:15.140]  vanity fair came out this month in the cover story i have the magazine
[3:00:15.140 --> 3:00:19.940]  and admits that christian conservative leaders go and have gay orgies there
[3:00:19.940 --> 3:00:26.340]  and that they do rituals but it goes on to say it's fun and no big deal
[3:00:26.340 --> 3:00:30.980]  now again people can say all bohemian growth they're just having fun no they
[3:00:30.980 --> 3:00:33.940]  take it seriously
[3:00:35.220 --> 3:00:39.220]  these people are lunatics jeryl salante coming up with two calls for
[3:00:39.220 --> 3:00:42.420]  steve quail quickly have your question ready please
[3:00:42.420 --> 3:00:46.420]  lennie in new york lennie and then barock that'll be it for calls for
[3:00:46.420 --> 3:00:50.180]  steve go ahead lennie hey with that man i heard you heard just the call and
[3:00:50.180 --> 3:00:53.540]  write our officials and have our voices be heard and i agree but
[3:00:53.540 --> 3:00:56.340]  since the thousand to one calls against the bailout in october and congress
[3:00:56.340 --> 3:01:00.660]  still passed it i just had no confidence in our officials
[3:01:00.660 --> 3:01:03.860]  well i agree with that but the thing is we're all demanding one thing we're
[3:01:03.860 --> 3:01:10.420]  demanding that napolitano step down and resign and why i'm saying this is that
[3:01:10.420 --> 3:01:14.580]  if everyone will focus on a specific individual who has targeted them
[3:01:14.580 --> 3:01:18.020]  the pressure this is one thing washington does respond to
[3:01:18.020 --> 3:01:22.500]  and i i'll go on to basically say alex i'm saying all we can do is buy time i
[3:01:22.500 --> 3:01:26.500]  don't know and then the message goes out that this is criminal and bad you
[3:01:26.500 --> 3:01:29.940]  have to punish them for saying all the veterans are basically terrorist and
[3:01:29.940 --> 3:01:34.260]  gun owners buying guns or terrorists and actually says that you have to
[3:01:34.260 --> 3:01:37.300]  they've thrown down the gauntlet you have to send the message to everybody
[3:01:37.300 --> 3:01:42.020]  that that was bad what she did if not the precedent set go ahead lennie
[3:01:42.020 --> 3:01:46.020]  no absolutely i just i just uh but you know we call the thousand to one
[3:01:46.020 --> 3:01:48.900]  against the bailout and they still you know they have an agenda they're going
[3:01:48.900 --> 3:01:51.700]  to go through with this but it's gotta be on record
[3:01:51.700 --> 3:01:55.380]  but it's gotta be on record that they're criminals doing the opposite of what
[3:01:55.380 --> 3:01:59.540]  the people in the constitution the law says appreciate your call correct steve
[3:01:59.540 --> 3:02:02.900]  yeah absolutely yeah i mean we've got to continue to fight
[3:02:02.900 --> 3:02:07.460]  uh... brock in long island brock here on the air oh hi alex and steve uh...
[3:02:07.460 --> 3:02:10.020]  you know i had a just a couple questions uh...
[3:02:10.020 --> 3:02:12.820]  you know one question i had was you know we've been talking about fighting the
[3:02:12.820 --> 3:02:16.340]  new world order and uh... i was thinking you know
[3:02:16.340 --> 3:02:19.860]  how about we use our systems against them uh... for example like
[3:02:19.860 --> 3:02:22.900]  what if we were to open our own bank and then be able to use fractional
[3:02:22.900 --> 3:02:26.420]  reserve to create funds and well they have to be regulated right now they
[3:02:26.420 --> 3:02:29.940]  may be either affiliated or marginalized it doesn't work
[3:02:29.940 --> 3:02:33.060]  they won't even if we were to have like you know i mean everybody on alex
[3:02:33.060 --> 3:02:36.020]  jones show as depositors and taking the money out of the major
[3:02:36.020 --> 3:02:38.900]  sir sir they will say that they will send a hit team to kill you they've done it
[3:02:38.900 --> 3:02:42.900]  to hundreds of people we know of or you can even be selling silver coins
[3:02:42.900 --> 3:02:46.260]  uh... and saying it's a new monetary system which is not illegal
[3:02:46.260 --> 3:02:49.300]  they still swat team you look at the liberty dollar steve telling
[3:02:49.300 --> 3:02:52.180]  well absolutely the bottom line is that listen
[3:02:52.180 --> 3:02:55.620]  the power to tax and the power to basically print money
[3:02:55.620 --> 3:02:59.380]  are the two most powerful and when i say this earthly powers
[3:02:59.380 --> 3:03:03.620]  that the illuminati basically uh... controls jesus said the love of money
[3:03:03.620 --> 3:03:07.300]  is a real evil to control of it so the point is that that is their power
[3:03:07.300 --> 3:03:12.100]  source they bribed they killed a steel they distort they absolutely use money
[3:03:12.100 --> 3:03:16.660]  and then when they acquire the power look it's why you think they shut the money
[3:03:16.660 --> 3:03:20.340]  supply off as soon as they get the power they shut it off to you so everything
[3:03:20.340 --> 3:03:22.980]  implodes so they can come consolidate steve great point
[3:03:22.980 --> 3:03:26.500]  but just in closing brock i'm not knocking you for the idea
[3:03:26.500 --> 3:03:31.940]  that's why if you are my exactly if you start becoming successful they come
[3:03:31.940 --> 3:03:34.900]  after you if you're some town or city with your own script
[3:03:34.900 --> 3:03:37.780]  and it's only being used here and there they leave you alone but if it gets
[3:03:37.780 --> 3:03:41.220]  popular they come after you right steve absolutely that's what we're seeing with
[3:03:41.220 --> 3:03:44.020]  the whole tea party movement with what what we put up on the site and we've
[3:03:44.020 --> 3:03:45.780]  talked about on the show today
[3:03:45.780 --> 3:03:48.580]  yeah brock anything else yeah you know you have one more question you had
[3:03:48.580 --> 3:03:51.460]  mentioned about uh... getting out of your ira i mean do you do you recommend
[3:03:51.460 --> 3:03:54.180]  just getting you know completely cashed it out and getting and paying the
[3:03:54.180 --> 3:03:57.220]  penalties and just having the money out of it or steve steve and jeryl
[3:03:57.220 --> 3:04:00.660]  salente and all our guests that are real real experts that get out when it was
[3:04:00.660 --> 3:04:02.660]  fourteen thousand three years ago
[3:04:02.660 --> 3:04:06.180]  yeah now it's probably gonna run back up maybe nine or ten
[3:04:06.180 --> 3:04:09.220]  then there'll be an even bigger plunge next time steve do you agree
[3:04:09.220 --> 3:04:13.060]  i agree alex the bottom line is they only put the best
[3:04:13.060 --> 3:04:17.060]  bait in the biggest trap and that's what this is this is a baiting going on
[3:04:17.060 --> 3:04:20.900]  right now look everybody is absolutely uh...
[3:04:20.900 --> 3:04:25.620]  uh... urged by me to get control i've talked to people have lost millions of
[3:04:25.620 --> 3:04:27.940]  dollars alex tens of thousands of thousands
[3:04:27.940 --> 3:04:30.980]  and i said why wouldn't you listen to me two years ago you know what they said
[3:04:30.980 --> 3:04:34.100]  because my broker said you guys are all nutcases
[3:04:34.100 --> 3:04:37.460]  well guess what when your seven-year-old woman lost two million bucks
[3:04:37.460 --> 3:04:42.020]  maybe the nutcases had more flavor to offer than the lying shill

[3:09:59.860 --> 3:10:04.500]  today's show um i i told the story before you were
[3:10:04.500 --> 3:10:07.540]  here with us about i see all these people that were at a local radio station i do
[3:10:07.540 --> 3:10:11.140]  a sunday show out of and back when i was bashing bush that was popular and
[3:10:11.140 --> 3:10:15.700]  trendy they liked me and would talk to me now one of them won't even talk to me
[3:10:15.700 --> 3:10:20.180]  and then sits out in the control room talking crap whenever i'm bashing obama
[3:10:20.180 --> 3:10:25.140]  saying he's a puppet because they have invested their psychology who they are
[3:10:25.140 --> 3:10:28.340]  their identity with him they've been suckered by the con man
[3:10:28.340 --> 3:10:32.820]  and can't admit it this is so infantile and so sad
[3:10:32.820 --> 3:10:37.940]  so it's not even they're stupid they are under the mind control of the system
[3:10:37.940 --> 3:10:41.220]  aren't they well you've really uh put it perfectly
[3:10:41.220 --> 3:10:47.700]  and before we go on i i want to thank you for including me in your wonderful
[3:10:47.700 --> 3:10:53.940]  production the obama deception and applaud you also for putting it out
[3:10:53.940 --> 3:10:57.940]  there so quickly cleanly and accurately
[3:10:57.940 --> 3:11:03.060]  and i'm i'm i'm honored to be a part of it and having that opportunity
[3:11:03.060 --> 3:11:05.620]  great you've had a chance to see it i mean give us your review
[3:11:05.620 --> 3:11:09.060]  all right that's right i think it's excellent you know i'm come i'm honored
[3:11:09.060 --> 3:11:12.820]  to be a part of it and uh we're going to say that
[3:11:12.820 --> 3:11:18.420]  lightly you know and uh as i said i i applaud you for getting out there
[3:11:18.420 --> 3:11:22.740]  quickly and and pointing out what a deception this is this is a song and
[3:11:22.740 --> 3:11:26.500]  dance show and you you aptly said it these people
[3:11:26.500 --> 3:11:31.700]  have this psychologically invested in this agent of change
[3:11:31.700 --> 3:11:36.820]  and when you look at the people who he's brought in for example
[3:11:36.820 --> 3:11:42.100]  to fix the the financial problems such as geithner and
[3:11:42.100 --> 3:11:49.220]  or zag and and summers uh clinton retreads robert rubin protégés
[3:11:49.220 --> 3:11:53.700]  it's like bringing in mireland ski machine gun kelly
[3:11:53.700 --> 3:11:58.020]  and bugsy seagull to win the war on crime
[3:11:58.020 --> 3:12:01.220]  i mean these are the same criminals that made it happen
[3:12:01.220 --> 3:12:05.220]  and now they're going to fix it so the what happens is
[3:12:05.220 --> 3:12:10.020]  and we see this the liberals are bigger hypocrites than the conservatives the
[3:12:10.020 --> 3:12:13.780]  conservatives believe they're they're lying if they want to go to war you
[3:12:13.780 --> 3:12:16.020]  know they'll go to war you know they'll they'll we're
[3:12:16.020 --> 3:12:19.860]  going to go kick butt they believe that they'll do it right or wrong
[3:12:19.860 --> 3:12:23.220]  they believe it the liberals on the other hand
[3:12:23.220 --> 3:12:28.100]  they're the bigger hypocrites they make every excuse that you could imagine
[3:12:28.100 --> 3:12:33.780]  for obama sending more troops to afghanistan with 21 000 now and i love
[3:12:33.780 --> 3:12:37.860]  it the last 4 000 they're really not troops they're advisors
[3:12:37.860 --> 3:12:42.180]  what am i an imbecile i grew up during a vietnam war i remember those advisors
[3:12:42.180 --> 3:12:47.380]  as well but they say things like well he inherited this situation
[3:12:47.380 --> 3:12:53.540]  they always make excuses they've they've drank the the kool-aid
[3:12:53.540 --> 3:12:58.340]  and their brains have been washed and they refuse to see
[3:12:58.340 --> 3:13:05.780]  what a big lie this is he is he is the antithesis of everything that liberals
[3:13:05.780 --> 3:13:11.780]  believe look what's going on now with the uh finding about it about the cia
[3:13:11.780 --> 3:13:16.100]  torture and then say oh no no no we're not going to prosecute them
[3:13:16.100 --> 3:13:21.540]  oh why not it was you arrived at this that we would be brought to justice
[3:13:21.540 --> 3:13:24.820]  but there's always an excuse the liberals will give
[3:13:24.820 --> 3:13:29.380]  forgiving obama who we have decided we're writing about it
[3:13:29.380 --> 3:13:35.060]  in the next edition of our transjournal that he is really the worst of clinton
[3:13:35.060 --> 3:13:42.340]  and the best of bush explain that well the worst of clinton in that
[3:13:42.340 --> 3:13:46.020]  this is the guy you know that clinton being the guy that
[3:13:46.020 --> 3:13:49.860]  really destroyed our economy he pushed through
[3:13:49.860 --> 3:13:55.380]  nafta and globalization that george bush the first and ronald reagan
[3:13:55.380 --> 3:13:59.460]  couldn't get through with the great promise with him and al gore
[3:13:59.460 --> 3:14:05.540]  that this was going to create more jobs and elevate our standard of living and
[3:14:05.540 --> 3:14:10.020]  of course it did nothing to do that it it drove us down
[3:14:10.020 --> 3:14:14.020]  in reverse this has nothing to do with free trade
[3:14:14.020 --> 3:14:18.740]  all it had to do with was opening up markets to slave labor
[3:14:18.740 --> 3:14:24.100]  opportunities so that ceo's could get their products made by slaves
[3:14:24.100 --> 3:14:28.900]  and ship them back overseas so they can make those absorbent salaries that
[3:14:28.900 --> 3:14:31.540]  they've got and that's phase one then it also
[3:14:31.540 --> 3:14:35.540]  vertically integrates the economy and creates a wasteland back in the us and
[3:14:35.540 --> 3:14:38.020]  western europe so the bankers can come back in and buy
[3:14:38.020 --> 3:14:41.060]  everything up correct correct and that's the other clinton
[3:14:41.060 --> 3:14:44.180]  one let's remember again who he's brought in
[3:14:44.180 --> 3:14:50.020]  machine gun kelly bugsy seagull and mayo lansky
[3:14:50.020 --> 3:14:53.940]  and when you look at these guys these are the clinton crew
[3:14:53.940 --> 3:14:59.380]  that destroyed the glass seagull act the banking act that was put in place
[3:14:59.380 --> 3:15:03.540]  so the banksters couldn't be get in the brokerage business
[3:15:03.540 --> 3:15:08.340]  and they would do traditional banking and the casinos couldn't gamble
[3:15:08.340 --> 3:15:16.020]  these are the same gangsters that deregulated the financial equity
[3:15:16.020 --> 3:15:20.980]  business so that they could come up with all these so-called exotic financial
[3:15:20.980 --> 3:15:25.540]  instruments such as derivatives credit swap defaults and you name whatever
[3:15:25.540 --> 3:15:28.260]  else that nobody knows what they're talking about
[3:15:28.260 --> 3:15:33.140]  these are the same people under under under clinton and of course you know
[3:15:33.140 --> 3:15:37.300]  clinton you know people forget that he was bombing a rock just about
[3:15:37.300 --> 3:15:40.740]  what on a weekly basis for almost eight years
[3:15:40.740 --> 3:15:44.340]  and when madeline all bright was asked by leslie
[3:15:44.340 --> 3:15:50.340]  stall on cbs's 60 minutes if the sanctions against the rock were worth
[3:15:50.340 --> 3:15:55.700]  the death of over 500 000 iraqi children under the age of five
[3:15:55.700 --> 3:16:00.100]  according to the u n she said quote it was worth the price
[3:16:00.100 --> 3:16:03.620]  so that's the worst of clinton without going into more of it
[3:16:03.620 --> 3:16:08.420]  and then the best of bush is he keeps keeping these wars going
[3:16:08.420 --> 3:16:12.900]  on easter weekend when nobody was paying attention to the news when i say
[3:16:12.900 --> 3:16:17.460]  nobody the majority uh... he asked for more money to wage the
[3:16:17.460 --> 3:16:22.260]  iraq war and the afghan war he's keeping these wars going
[3:16:22.260 --> 3:16:25.620]  innocent people are being killed in iraq for false
[3:16:25.620 --> 3:16:29.300]  reasons the reasons that bush gave us was that there were ties
[3:16:29.300 --> 3:16:34.020]  stalkata and weapons of mass destruction both of them are false
[3:16:34.020 --> 3:16:38.660]  so he's he's the way they are and also the rendition he's keeping that going
[3:16:38.660 --> 3:16:42.420]  where you could all we're closing guantanamo we'll just send them overseas
[3:16:42.420 --> 3:16:45.460]  to get tortured oh and look what he's doing with the wire
[3:16:45.460 --> 3:16:49.780]  tapping he's defending bush's wire tapping excesses
[3:16:49.780 --> 3:16:54.100]  he's actually he's actually expanding it and if you look at total troop numbers
[3:16:54.100 --> 3:16:56.420]  first they said instantly he'll bring the troops on
[3:16:56.420 --> 3:17:00.660]  then sixteen months then twenty three now is top generals are saying maybe
[3:17:00.660 --> 3:17:04.020]  never maybe we'll just keep a hundred and fifty thousand iraq
[3:17:04.020 --> 3:17:09.220]  but they've already doubled afghanistan uh... so total it's an increase
[3:17:09.220 --> 3:17:13.620]  across the board and you talk to the leftist they're not really the leftist
[3:17:13.620 --> 3:17:17.300]  they're just literally buying this this madison avenue creation
[3:17:17.300 --> 3:17:21.780]  and they say well he you know at least it's him doing it now
[3:17:21.780 --> 3:17:26.580]  i mean this is unbelievable it is it's hypocrisy is that as i said and you
[3:17:26.580 --> 3:17:29.620]  aptly put pointed it out that he's increasing the bush
[3:17:29.620 --> 3:17:34.180]  wire tapping excesses he's doing everything that the liberals hate
[3:17:34.180 --> 3:17:38.740]  and and again it's the song and dance america i mean look at this guy i mean
[3:17:38.740 --> 3:17:41.940]  can you imagine a president appearing with comics
[3:17:41.940 --> 3:17:46.500]  on a late night comic show like jay leno where's the dignity but they'll do
[3:17:46.500 --> 3:17:50.100]  anything to push it through hey what do you think about him
[3:17:50.100 --> 3:17:52.820]  uh... lying about everything i mean not just big issues but
[3:17:52.820 --> 3:17:56.260]  bowing grabbing his hand bowing all the way straight down
[3:17:56.260 --> 3:17:59.140]  and then saying oh i dropped something on the floor all i was
[3:17:59.140 --> 3:18:03.300]  he was too short when the guys almost as tall as him he clearly bowels and then
[3:18:03.300 --> 3:18:04.980]  lies about it
[3:18:04.980 --> 3:18:08.100]  well look what sarcosis said about him uh...
[3:18:08.100 --> 3:18:13.380]  about uh... this hardly made the news as well when he he talked about
[3:18:13.380 --> 3:18:18.740]  basically what a lightweight obama is and uh... he said he's a groveling
[3:18:18.740 --> 3:18:22.900]  uh... kiss but fake total lightweight who just literally just grovels and
[3:18:22.900 --> 3:18:24.580]  sarcosis said
[3:18:24.580 --> 3:18:27.700]  all he does is put out rhetoric it's not even real
[3:18:27.700 --> 3:18:30.340]  that they're actually gonna you know keep all their missiles
[3:18:30.340 --> 3:18:33.460]  but he's running around saying they're gonna slash him and sarcosis doesn't
[3:18:33.460 --> 3:18:35.860]  even care about that the point is he just said this guy
[3:18:35.860 --> 3:18:39.540]  even in private meetings is a complete liar and a complete groveling
[3:18:39.540 --> 3:18:42.980]  lightweight again uh... you you would hit it
[3:18:42.980 --> 3:18:47.140]  you write on the numbers and when we look what's happened to america
[3:18:47.140 --> 3:18:50.500]  and this is one of the the trend alerts that we put out
[3:18:50.500 --> 3:18:54.580]  is we're calling for an intellectual revolution people better get smart
[3:18:54.580 --> 3:18:55.540]  about this
[3:18:55.540 --> 3:18:58.740]  and stop listening to comics and clowns and
[3:18:58.740 --> 3:19:02.500]  and buffoons and and that's and con men
[3:19:02.500 --> 3:19:05.380]  and that's what we call obama you know he
[3:19:05.380 --> 3:19:09.540]  he he's the con man in chief and and the
[3:19:09.540 --> 3:19:10.420]  again
[3:19:10.420 --> 3:19:13.540]  it would be they you go to any of these liberal
[3:19:13.540 --> 3:19:18.100]  websites or any of the web sites even i mean in newspapers

[3:24:27.300 --> 3:24:32.900]  is to stall the left long enough for the banks to end up
[3:24:32.900 --> 3:24:38.180]  as sanguating or sucking the nation dry and also drive a left right wedge you
[3:24:38.180 --> 3:24:41.700]  notice uh how the media is trying to say anybody who
[3:24:41.700 --> 3:24:45.140]  protests the taxes is a racist period that's been a
[3:24:45.140 --> 3:24:50.740]  talking point on cnn and msnbc like parrots
[3:24:50.740 --> 3:24:54.500]  uh... and then you've got fox playing a part of oh yes this is all right wing
[3:24:54.500 --> 3:24:57.380]  then they've automatically got the people divided if 98 percent are against
[3:24:57.380 --> 3:25:00.660]  the bank or takeover they gotta make it a left right issue don't they
[3:25:00.660 --> 3:25:03.940]  uh... do you see folks i mean you speak to that system of control and then do
[3:25:03.940 --> 3:25:07.940]  you see that working with your trends research
[3:25:07.940 --> 3:25:12.100]  well the left is going to stay with obama
[3:25:12.100 --> 3:25:16.100]  regardless of what he does just like they did with clinton
[3:25:16.100 --> 3:25:20.180]  as i said the liberals are bigger hypocrites than the
[3:25:20.180 --> 3:25:24.340]  than the conservatives the conservatives believe what they're doing the liberals
[3:25:24.340 --> 3:25:28.900]  turn blind eyes to make excuses on the issues of the tax
[3:25:28.900 --> 3:25:34.340]  revolts and how they've defied divine divided this between left and right
[3:25:34.340 --> 3:25:38.180]  it's very important to understand what's going on here
[3:25:38.180 --> 3:25:43.540]  in the sense that if you go back to our trends journal
[3:25:43.540 --> 3:25:49.700]  and this went out in december of 2007 for our top trends coming up
[3:25:49.700 --> 3:25:55.700]  in the coming years one of them was tax revolts now remember bush was president
[3:25:55.700 --> 3:25:59.300]  when we wrote this and this is what we said
[3:25:59.300 --> 3:26:03.460]  it was the reason for starting the first american revolution
[3:26:03.460 --> 3:26:09.300]  and as the trends add up it will also be a reason for starting the second
[3:26:09.300 --> 3:26:13.220]  fed up and not willing or able to take it anymore
[3:26:13.220 --> 3:26:20.260]  overtaxed americans will begin the battle against politicians and bureaucrats
[3:26:20.260 --> 3:26:24.660]  in the fight to lower and or repeal taxes
[3:26:24.660 --> 3:26:28.820]  this has nothing to do with obama
[3:26:28.820 --> 3:26:33.780]  this has to do with property taxes school taxes
[3:26:33.780 --> 3:26:42.500]  sin taxes hassle taxes sales taxes people are losing their jobs
[3:26:42.500 --> 3:26:48.500]  they're losing their homes they've lost alex in the last year
[3:26:48.500 --> 3:26:55.700]  11 trillion dollars worth of wealth the american people
[3:26:55.700 --> 3:27:00.500]  in terms of stocks and lost values in their homes
[3:27:00.500 --> 3:27:04.020]  that's what this is about this has nothing to do
[3:27:04.020 --> 3:27:07.700]  with left or right and what's happening
[3:27:07.700 --> 3:27:11.700]  are different people out there are exploiting it
[3:27:11.700 --> 3:27:16.580]  particularly the politicians and some of the people in the media
[3:27:16.580 --> 3:27:20.260]  this is not a left-wing what we called it was
[3:27:20.260 --> 3:27:27.460]  the coalition of the cash strapped will lead a mainstream american tax battle
[3:27:27.460 --> 3:27:33.300]  we wrote this in 2007 so we always get a kick out of
[3:27:33.300 --> 3:27:38.740]  how the people that didn't see it coming are now saying what it's all about
[3:27:38.740 --> 3:27:41.860]  and then they proclaim what's going to happen next
[3:27:41.860 --> 3:27:46.260]  and then history was made start over as i interrupted you
[3:27:46.260 --> 3:27:51.140]  then we have janine garofalo and on cnn and the and the uh... rachel madow
[3:27:51.140 --> 3:27:54.260]  on msnbc what a disgusting

[3:28:10.580 --> 3:28:13.940]  with a snotty little teabagging routine
[3:28:13.940 --> 3:28:17.460]  but she must have said a hundred times in ten minutes
[3:28:17.460 --> 3:28:23.060]  you know it's again it's those people that are trying to deride everyone
[3:28:23.060 --> 3:28:27.460]  that this is a pocketbook issue this has nothing to do with ideology
[3:28:27.460 --> 3:28:30.180]  well that's what i was going to say next and she cold bloodedly knows that
[3:28:30.180 --> 3:28:32.900]  none oberman was there i lost all respect for him
[3:28:32.900 --> 3:28:37.220]  knowingly saying that we were engaged in weird fallacious for those that don't
[3:28:37.220 --> 3:28:41.460]  know that's what the teabagging thing is to see national tv anderson cooper
[3:28:41.460 --> 3:28:44.660]  was doing it on cnn and then she said they're all
[3:28:44.660 --> 3:28:48.100]  racist they hate black people that is the racism

[3:28:56.260 --> 3:29:00.740]  foreign banks looting everything uh... we're on the verge of riots and she
[3:29:00.740 --> 3:29:04.900]  injects race into it so poor black folks when they see people out there
[3:29:04.900 --> 3:29:06.900]  protesting you know there's a lot of black folks there
[3:29:06.900 --> 3:29:11.540]  think it's about giant kukluck's clan rally is that not literally

[3:33:32.420 --> 3:33:36.100]  a good term for them they know though they think they're these big smart
[3:33:36.100 --> 3:33:39.700]  geniuses that they're desperate they know their parasites they're not really
[3:33:39.700 --> 3:33:42.980]  liberals it's like Margaret singer all her private papers how much she hated
[3:33:42.980 --> 3:33:46.180]  blacks or to kill them all of it she would go around explaining the blacks
[3:33:46.180 --> 3:33:49.060]  how much she loved him as a liberal and you know let's just sterilize you're
[3:33:49.060 --> 3:33:51.620]  having abortion it's the same thing with these people
[3:33:51.620 --> 3:33:54.740]  they love to pimp around limousine liberals you know like
[3:33:54.740 --> 3:33:58.660]  they're helping everybody and they're good but her and oberman scientifically
[3:33:58.660 --> 3:34:02.420]  know that ninety eight percent of the american people that's a conservative
[3:34:02.420 --> 3:34:04.900]  number some poll show ninety nine percent against the banker takeover as you
[3:34:04.900 --> 3:34:08.100]  know jerald are together so they gotta make this
[3:34:08.100 --> 3:34:12.500]  a left-wing right-wing issue and fox financing trying to take that over
[3:34:12.500 --> 3:34:15.700]  they're the party out of power the republicans so they can act like
[3:34:15.700 --> 3:34:19.060]  their patriots now rick perry and all these politicians
[3:34:19.060 --> 3:34:22.420]  can you elaborate on that and i mean just the cold-blooded
[3:34:22.420 --> 3:34:26.420]  treason of this trying to get the american people fighting with each other
[3:34:26.420 --> 3:34:32.100]  and on national tv injecting race and racism into things
[3:34:32.100 --> 3:34:35.300]  so that black folks when you see them you know at the grocery store think you're
[3:34:35.300 --> 3:34:38.180]  out to get them i mean this is amazing
[3:34:38.180 --> 3:34:42.100]  well again what they're trying to do as we see it
[3:34:42.100 --> 3:34:46.340]  with minimizing this tax revolts is that
[3:34:46.340 --> 3:34:50.420]  this has legs as i said we're the folks that saw it coming
[3:34:50.420 --> 3:34:53.700]  first and wrote about it as far as we know
[3:34:53.700 --> 3:34:57.940]  and we're saying this was his story a historical event
[3:34:57.940 --> 3:35:01.860]  so when you have the president senior white house advisor
[3:35:01.860 --> 3:35:08.020]  axlerot going on face the nation and saying this country this is a country
[3:35:08.020 --> 3:35:12.900]  where we value liberties and our ability to express ourselves
[3:35:12.900 --> 3:35:17.220]  and he goes these expressions are unhealthy and then you have that guy
[3:35:17.220 --> 3:35:21.060]  carville uh... he's he called the tea party
[3:35:21.060 --> 3:35:25.780]  movement quote harmless and damaging to republicans
[3:35:25.780 --> 3:35:29.380]  so clearly what they're trying to do is
[3:35:29.380 --> 3:35:34.180]  they know the power of this and they're trying to marginalize it
[3:35:34.180 --> 3:35:39.940]  by putting people in these categories this has nothing to do with ideology
[3:35:39.940 --> 3:35:43.700]  are they libertarians and and republicans out there of course there
[3:35:43.700 --> 3:35:48.420]  are but they're just angry people that are losing everything
[3:35:48.420 --> 3:35:53.380]  and that's the bigger picture so this is meant and this is meant
[3:35:53.380 --> 3:35:56.260]  to keep the democrats from coming out and joining
[3:35:56.260 --> 3:36:00.660]  the american people the democrats that are exactly exactly it's keeping the
[3:36:00.660 --> 3:36:04.340]  democrats and other people out from joining them
[3:36:04.340 --> 3:36:07.700]  and they're driving a wedge and they're doing a good job at
[3:36:07.700 --> 3:36:11.860]  but it's only going to be temporary because when it gets down to the pocket
[3:36:11.860 --> 3:36:15.140]  book issue then it becomes real which by the way
[3:36:15.140 --> 3:36:19.380]  that's the next thing and as you well know from our trends journal
[3:36:19.380 --> 3:36:22.580]  uh... in the spring edition we wrote a lot about it
[3:36:22.580 --> 3:36:25.940]  and that this recovery that we're seeing
[3:36:25.940 --> 3:36:28.900]  is in the stock market what we called it was a
[3:36:28.900 --> 3:36:33.620]  false flag recovery these banks as you well know
[3:36:33.620 --> 3:36:38.260]  they're now allowed to value their toxic assets at any number that they want to
[3:36:38.260 --> 3:36:41.620]  give them and they're promote they're producing
[3:36:41.620 --> 3:36:47.780]  fake earning uh... increases and it's like you giving i you give me
[3:36:47.780 --> 3:36:52.100]  couple of billion dollars i'll report some some earnings increases
[3:36:52.100 --> 3:36:55.540]  oh i'll show your profit give me some more billions
[3:36:55.540 --> 3:36:58.660]  this thing is going down it's going to be non-stop
[3:36:58.660 --> 3:37:03.700]  and the people that don't see what's coming and do not take preventive measures
[3:37:03.700 --> 3:37:07.220]  and you pointed it out very clearly in the obama deception
[3:37:07.220 --> 3:37:10.980]  and if anyone didn't see it yet they don't know what they're missing
[3:37:10.980 --> 3:37:13.860]  and and and and people need to know this
[3:37:13.860 --> 3:37:17.540]  that they better take precautionary measures now
[3:37:17.540 --> 3:37:22.820]  because the ship is sinking and as you well know also alex
[3:37:22.820 --> 3:37:26.180]  they're calling what we're putting out pessimism
[3:37:26.180 --> 3:37:31.300]  porn you know they and and they have this you know they laugh about it oh
[3:37:31.300 --> 3:37:35.780]  you're so lengthy predicted this he predicted jerald jerald jerald let me
[3:37:35.780 --> 3:37:38.100]  stop you let me stop you there for just a second
[3:37:38.100 --> 3:37:41.460]  i need you to your phone receiver so good it's kind of overdrive and so back
[3:37:41.460 --> 3:37:43.060]  off the phone because i want to talk to you
[3:37:43.060 --> 3:37:45.540]  no no no no it's it's probably our fault but um
[3:37:45.540 --> 3:37:49.460]  yeah yeah start over with this pessimism porn and then that leads into my next
[3:37:49.460 --> 3:37:52.820]  question we have these myack reports that we broke
[3:37:52.820 --> 3:37:56.580]  and the federal reports saying those buying guns the number one threat to
[3:37:56.580 --> 3:38:00.500]  the government and ammo uh... reports that the veterans of the
[3:38:00.500 --> 3:38:04.260]  number one threat so they built up this anti-terror apparatus
[3:38:04.260 --> 3:38:07.460]  as i've been predicting for years they've been swung around
[3:38:07.460 --> 3:38:11.700]  overnight and pointed it at the tax protesters gun owners
[3:38:11.700 --> 3:38:14.820]  i mean this is turning into hardcore tyranny so can you
[3:38:14.820 --> 3:38:18.580]  elaborate on what you were just talking about uh... with them calling us
[3:38:18.580 --> 3:38:21.460]  uh... pessimism porn and then leading into
[3:38:21.460 --> 3:38:25.220]  we're terrorists in the new domestic cia to watch us
[3:38:25.220 --> 3:38:29.540]  well that the new york times in an op-ed piece on march 26 they called what
[3:38:29.540 --> 3:38:35.220]  what i'm putting out pessimism porn and even though of course they cite all the
[3:38:35.220 --> 3:38:38.820]  accuracies that we have produced over the
[3:38:38.820 --> 3:38:43.380]  nearly thirty years of business so they came out with this one we're calling
[3:38:43.380 --> 3:38:47.300]  what they're putting out optimism opium
[3:38:47.300 --> 3:38:51.940]  you won't die from porn but boy you'll die from this optimism opium
[3:38:51.940 --> 3:38:56.260]  because the ship is going down and they've drug the people
[3:38:56.260 --> 3:38:59.860]  and then you pointed it out with the with this left-wing movement
[3:38:59.860 --> 3:39:02.660]  and these liberals they're drugging the people
[3:39:02.660 --> 3:39:06.820]  into believing the lines it's optimism opium
[3:39:06.820 --> 3:39:10.980]  they keep selling it and at the same level by the way they're always pushing
[3:39:10.980 --> 3:39:14.660]  out you know the economist say this the economist say that
[3:39:14.660 --> 3:39:18.820]  but we need to be confident we need to be optimistic wait a minute if you're
[3:39:18.820 --> 3:39:22.500]  going to stick with the economics and use mathematical formulas
[3:39:22.500 --> 3:39:25.700]  and call it a science even though it's a pseudo science
[3:39:25.700 --> 3:39:29.300]  then what is optimism and confidence have with this
[3:39:29.300 --> 3:39:33.220]  this isn't about pessimism the ship has hit an iceberg
[3:39:33.220 --> 3:39:38.260]  it's sinking and you better grab a lifeboat a lifejacket or a life raft
[3:39:38.260 --> 3:39:40.820]  because it's not even going to be debris to hang on to
[3:39:40.820 --> 3:39:46.180]  this thing's going down quickly and they're causing the people into thinking
[3:39:46.180 --> 3:39:50.980]  that this is going to be saved by a song and dance man out there
[3:39:50.980 --> 3:39:55.860]  that's going to to bring the country into a new age it's not happening
[3:39:55.860 --> 3:39:59.940]  well gerald it's worse than that i mean it's even worse from from my research
[3:39:59.940 --> 3:40:03.060]  what you're saying they're taking lifeboats and have left
[3:40:03.060 --> 3:40:07.460]  and have got bull horns telling us to not grab pieces of you know the deck to
[3:40:07.460 --> 3:40:10.660]  try to float on and and and they're telling us we're not even on a ship
[3:40:10.660 --> 3:40:14.260]  we're not even on the north atlantic and then meanwhile
[3:40:14.260 --> 3:40:17.620]  they're now saying people that don't like the banks are terrorists and we found
[3:40:17.620 --> 3:40:20.740]  out when we were protesting the fed that's in the obama deception we got the
[3:40:20.740 --> 3:40:25.300]  secret document now it's mainstream news the army was watching us and the army
[3:40:25.300 --> 3:40:28.820]  document that got leaked to us and then we put it out and now the news confirmed
[3:40:28.820 --> 3:40:32.980]  it says look out military don't let them know your military spying on them
[3:40:32.980 --> 3:40:38.180]  they're terrorists and may kill you i mean this is entering cuckoo land
[3:40:38.180 --> 3:40:42.580]  well it's not entering cuckoo land what it's entering is fascism
[3:40:42.580 --> 3:40:48.580]  and that's what this is the merger of of of corporate and state powers
[3:40:48.580 --> 3:40:52.500]  according to musolini who knew a thing or two about fascism
[3:40:52.500 --> 3:40:56.660]  that's what he called it and that's what's going on now
[3:40:56.660 --> 3:41:00.980]  and and this is just the first now it's versus the economic fascism
[3:41:00.980 --> 3:41:04.260]  secondly is going to be the political fascism
[3:41:04.260 --> 3:41:08.580]  america's turning into a fascist state and i'm not a right-winger i'm not a
[3:41:08.580 --> 3:41:13.700]  left-winger i'm a political atheist i call a spade a spade i have no trouble
[3:41:13.700 --> 3:41:18.420]  with that and when you look again at the definition by musolini
[3:41:18.420 --> 3:41:25.380]  the merger of corporate and state powers is called
[3:41:25.380 --> 3:41:29.620]  fascism so what you're talking about with it with the
[3:41:29.620 --> 3:41:32.900]  with the intelligence and with the wire tapping
[3:41:32.900 --> 3:41:37.140]  and calling us extremists that's the next level
[3:41:37.140 --> 3:41:41.540]  that's to put down the revolt and the and and and the revulsion
[3:41:41.540 --> 3:41:46.580]  of what's going on but we're obviously on the right saying we shouldn't have
[3:41:46.580 --> 3:41:49.060]  offshore banks hijacking the government
[3:41:49.060 --> 3:41:53.380]  bipartisan liens stealing 12.8 trillion the gdp
[3:41:53.380 --> 3:41:59.060]  in six months and you know that's in uh... you know late april 2009 god knows
[3:41:59.060 --> 3:42:01.300]  what it'll be soon they're saying it's online to be
[3:42:01.300 --> 3:42:04.580]  26 trillion by the end of the year uh... that'll be
[3:42:04.580 --> 3:42:09.220]  double the gdp i mean this is just open crime
[3:42:09.220 --> 3:42:12.820]  and i guess then gerald or you're saying they're going for broken
[3:42:12.820 --> 3:42:16.340]  uh... there i mean because now they're announcing white house official says
[3:42:16.340 --> 3:42:20.740]  we'll bail out the newspapers and tv but then the government will own it and
[3:42:20.740 --> 3:42:22.900]  tell them what to say that's all eight times
[3:42:22.900 --> 3:42:27.620]  and then we have them firing the head of gm and telling them what to do
[3:42:27.620 --> 3:42:31.220]  and telling the head of dodge you will let fiat the bill deberg group on
[3:42:31.220 --> 3:42:34.820]  thing take you over i mean i it really is fascism
[3:42:34.820 --> 3:42:39.780]  again you know americans are drug with the most medicated country in the world
[3:42:39.780 --> 3:42:43.540]  and now we're drugged on this optimism opium
[3:42:43.540 --> 3:42:46.500]  that we have the uh... showman in chief
[3:42:46.500 --> 3:42:48.900]  uh... singing and dancing it out there
[3:42:48.900 --> 3:42:51.620]  you know putting on all these state shows
[3:42:51.620 --> 3:42:57.300]  so uh... that they're drugged the people are drugged in more ways than one
[3:42:57.300 --> 3:43:00.180]  and then now you know that i mean you could you go out
[3:43:00.180 --> 3:43:03.380]  you see people there with it whether with their twittering
[3:43:03.380 --> 3:43:08.580]  they're text messaging they're out of their minds they're not watching what's
[3:43:08.580 --> 3:43:12.820]  going on and when you have that kind of situation alex
[3:43:12.820 --> 3:43:15.540]  you could get any you could push everything over on that
[3:43:15.540 --> 3:43:20.100]  it's a little going on right now it's a spell it's like they've been hypnotized
[3:43:20.100 --> 3:43:25.460]  right again it's optimism opium they sell it every day
[3:43:25.460 --> 3:43:29.540]  can't you say stuff look at the baby can't you say something positive
[3:43:29.540 --> 3:43:33.780]  that's a guy i have a times i hear that i mean look at the last words of the
[3:43:33.780 --> 3:43:37.620]  guy who entered it did the uh... good morning america
[3:43:37.620 --> 3:43:40.820]  uh... uh... interview with me said something like
[3:43:40.820 --> 3:43:44.820]  oh you know you're not a happy guy or something like that you know i mean
[3:43:44.820 --> 3:43:47.700]  sometimes silly thing is a nice enough guy
[3:43:47.700 --> 3:43:51.140]  and by the way i have to tell you fox has been very good with me
[3:43:51.140 --> 3:43:55.380]  and and i've got to know in a number of the people on the fox happy hour
[3:43:55.380 --> 3:43:59.540]  and i can't say enough good things about them and they don't they're not
[3:43:59.540 --> 3:44:04.180]  the people that i talked to on the set and i've been on that show quite a bit
[3:44:04.180 --> 3:44:08.020]  i have to tell you you know they're not they're not taking stands they're not
[3:44:08.020 --> 3:44:11.220]  republican or democrat right or left you know they're
[3:44:11.220 --> 3:44:14.420]  set up with this stuff let me tell you let me tell you i've talked over the
[3:44:14.420 --> 3:44:18.180]  years a lot of fox producers and their listeners of the show they know about
[3:44:18.180 --> 3:44:21.620]  the new world order they can't stand what they're doing
[3:44:21.620 --> 3:44:26.580]  uh... and also murdoch is smart he will brand whatever country he's in he'll
[3:44:26.580 --> 3:44:30.820]  go with what the prevailing attitude is and so right now he knows just like
[3:44:30.820 --> 3:44:33.780]  you said this is the trend patriotism liberty
[3:44:33.780 --> 3:44:38.100]  getting back to seventeen seventy six instead of two nineteen eighty four
[3:44:38.100 --> 3:44:41.940]  culture they know that this is the rising tide and so
[3:44:41.940 --> 3:44:46.900]  uh... yes they want to be popular uh... now the msnb season others they're
[3:44:46.900 --> 3:44:47.940]  trying to
[3:44:47.940 --> 3:44:51.860]  go along with the uh... optimism opium other you were trying to uh...
[3:44:51.860 --> 3:44:56.340]  talk about right there now gerald what do you see on the front of
[3:44:56.340 --> 3:45:00.340]  trying to restrict free speech because
[3:45:00.340 --> 3:45:04.660]  uh... they're now announcing senator j rockefeller has said hey
[3:45:04.660 --> 3:45:07.620]  we'd be better off without an internet we need to have a new internet too we
[3:45:07.620 --> 3:45:11.540]  don't have any of these freedoms uh... where we control what you can do where
[3:45:11.540 --> 3:45:16.100]  sites are restricted uh... all over the west from australia to
[3:45:16.100 --> 3:45:20.500]  canada they're announcing chinese style net censorship that's a headline
[3:45:20.500 --> 3:45:24.820]  uh... but saying it's good how do you see them going after the internet
[3:45:24.820 --> 3:45:28.340]  they're gonna go after everything they're going to try to take as many of our
[3:45:28.340 --> 3:45:32.660]  rights away as possible and obama is going to be able to do it even
[3:45:32.660 --> 3:45:36.260]  better than bush because he has broad support
[3:45:36.260 --> 3:45:40.100]  and they've also may try a false flag incident
[3:45:40.100 --> 3:45:43.620]  that they're going to say we have to you know because of this incident
[3:45:43.620 --> 3:45:47.780]  we have to restrict your rights just like they push through the patriot act
[3:45:47.780 --> 3:45:51.380]  and of course we also know that obama as well
[3:45:51.380 --> 3:45:56.260]  uh... voted to reinstate the patriot act and is bringing it to new levels as
[3:45:56.260 --> 3:46:00.100]  well so we see more and more restrictions
[3:46:00.100 --> 3:46:04.020]  and there's going to be more and more of a clamp down and net neutrality is going
[3:46:04.020 --> 3:46:05.860]  to be a huge issue
[3:46:05.860 --> 3:46:10.980]  jerald salente going back to torture then the media tried to spin it
[3:46:10.980 --> 3:46:14.980]  except for agency french press and a few others the media tried to spin that
[3:46:14.980 --> 3:46:19.380]  he had rebuked torture but when you read the orders in the statements he says
[3:46:19.380 --> 3:46:22.180]  we've got to protect our professionals that did the torture
[3:46:22.180 --> 3:46:26.500]  and followed orders so what he really did in precedent was overthrow
[3:46:26.500 --> 3:46:30.980]  what was decided at nurenberg uh... that just following orders doesn't cut it
[3:46:30.980 --> 3:46:34.100]  he now says no you're going to be protected in government
[3:46:34.100 --> 3:46:37.860]  if you follow orders to commit brutal crimes including torturing children
[3:46:37.860 --> 3:46:42.100]  with insects yeah i i know it's uh... it's
[3:46:42.100 --> 3:46:45.220]  again this is where the country is heading
[3:46:45.220 --> 3:46:48.820]  and people better as i said they better wake up quickly
[3:46:48.820 --> 3:46:52.180]  uh... not only are we going to lose our rights
[3:46:52.180 --> 3:46:56.020]  but before you know it you're going to lose all your money too
[3:46:56.020 --> 3:47:00.820]  because what they're also talking about this with new reserve currency
[3:47:00.820 --> 3:47:05.620]  you we see with china they're not dumping dollars they're buying up assets
[3:47:05.620 --> 3:47:09.380]  we still believe there's going to be it the dollars going to
[3:47:09.380 --> 3:47:14.500]  dive hyperinflation and we're still very bullish on gold
[3:47:14.500 --> 3:47:19.940]  and it's very important now that people again take proactive measures
[3:47:19.940 --> 3:47:24.820]  in anticipation of what's to come we're already seeing the brakes again now in
[3:47:24.820 --> 3:47:28.500]  the stock market today the markets down well over two hundred
[3:47:28.500 --> 3:47:32.980]  points banks are now again reporting week earnings
[3:47:32.980 --> 3:47:37.140]  it's just at the beginning there's no way out
[3:47:37.140 --> 3:47:40.900]  well general i want this in your you know your perspective on this but
[3:47:40.900 --> 3:47:45.540]  what i see is a massive contraction layoffs uh... you know more than six
[3:47:45.540 --> 3:47:48.740]  hundred thousand every month now in the real economy
[3:47:48.740 --> 3:47:51.540]  while they try to pump up their fiat economy so
[3:47:51.540 --> 3:47:54.340]  you know there's a disconnector like well that's doing better but this is
[3:47:54.340 --> 3:47:56.660]  doing worse can you explain that to people
[3:47:56.660 --> 3:47:59.940]  well you know what they're doing is as you well know for example let's take it
[3:47:59.940 --> 3:48:03.700]  with uh... unemployment where they have there's the official
[3:48:03.700 --> 3:48:07.060]  unemployment number and then there's the total unemployment
[3:48:07.060 --> 3:48:10.660]  number when you look at total unemployment according to
[3:48:10.660 --> 3:48:13.860]  some statisticians at the university of Maryland
[3:48:13.860 --> 3:48:17.540]  it's at seventeen percent these include people that
[3:48:17.540 --> 3:48:20.980]  no longer are looking for work because they've given up
[3:48:20.980 --> 3:48:23.860]  they can't find jobs they're off the unemployment rolls
[3:48:23.860 --> 3:48:28.660]  and people that are working uh... part-time and they want full-time work
[3:48:28.660 --> 3:48:33.620]  we're going to see unemployment rolls hitting unemployment real unemployment
[3:48:33.620 --> 3:48:38.100]  at about twenty five percent they're going to keep spinning the data as much
[3:48:38.100 --> 3:48:41.780]  as they can they do it all the time they come out with numbers
[3:48:41.780 --> 3:48:45.780]  and then they adjust them after a month later and they're much worse than they
[3:48:45.780 --> 3:48:48.500]  are and then that way we go ahead
[3:48:48.500 --> 3:48:52.100]  we also have to look at what's going on globally
[3:48:52.100 --> 3:48:56.340]  we're seeing coming out of japan for example uh... last month
[3:48:56.340 --> 3:49:00.580]  uh... february's numbers february exports were off
[3:49:00.580 --> 3:49:04.980]  forty nine percent taiwan exports are off
[3:49:04.980 --> 3:49:08.740]  forty two percent the eastern european
[3:49:08.740 --> 3:49:11.620]  well used to be called the eastern european bloc
[3:49:11.620 --> 3:49:16.180]  they're under water latvia, lithuania, hungary, romania
[3:49:16.180 --> 3:49:21.060]  they're gone you saw riots in iceland that was just the beginning
[3:49:21.060 --> 3:49:26.180]  spain, ireland, you name the country the u k
[3:49:26.180 --> 3:49:29.540]  this we're going into the greatest depression
[3:49:29.540 --> 3:49:33.220]  this is no joke it's not pessimism porn
[3:49:33.220 --> 3:49:37.540]  the people that believe the opposite again they're taking the drug
[3:49:37.540 --> 3:49:40.900]  they're drinking the kool-aid their brains are washed
[3:49:40.900 --> 3:49:45.860]  and they're dying from optimism opium they better take measures now
[3:49:45.860 --> 3:49:50.820]  that was my next question they announced this g20 they've engineered the crisis
[3:49:50.820 --> 3:49:52.900]  now the very banks that engineered it say
[3:49:52.900 --> 3:49:56.900]  we're setting up a bank of the world you're going to pay carbon taxes
[3:49:56.900 --> 3:50:01.700]  to us uh... they're going to cut the carbon in the us but not in china and
[3:50:01.700 --> 3:50:04.980]  india that'll further destroy our economy
[3:50:04.980 --> 3:50:08.500]  they don't care about our economy
[3:50:08.500 --> 3:50:12.980]  it's about bottom line we know that from the top
[3:50:12.980 --> 3:50:18.420]  and that's why the discrepancy between the average worker and the ceo
[3:50:18.420 --> 3:50:20.820]  depending on whose numbers you look at
[3:50:20.820 --> 3:50:23.780]  can range as high as five hundred to one
[3:50:23.780 --> 3:50:26.740]  when i was a young man getting into the workforce
[3:50:26.740 --> 3:50:30.980]  in the late nineteen sixties it was twenty to one
[3:50:30.980 --> 3:50:34.500]  that's the only thing they're interested is bottom line
[3:50:34.500 --> 3:50:38.260]  profits you're going to start seeing some major failures
[3:50:38.260 --> 3:50:41.860]  remember the commercial real estate collapse i was talking about
[3:50:41.860 --> 3:50:45.620]  it's starting to happen let's talk about that in the final segment with jeryl
[3:50:45.620 --> 3:50:48.980]  salente friendsresearch.com is the website put it up
[3:50:48.980 --> 3:50:51.460]  on screen for folks there in the break watching in prison

[3:51:05.220 --> 3:51:07.940]  difficult decision to cut back on our expenses

[3:52:05.540 --> 3:52:10.020]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them a stake
[3:52:10.020 --> 3:52:14.260]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see
[3:52:14.260 --> 3:52:17.540]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:52:17.540 --> 3:52:20.740]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:52:20.740 --> 3:52:25.220]  well obama's already fudging yeah fudged since d1 in this election

[3:54:48.340 --> 3:54:51.620]  this is a regular guest but i wanted to get into what you talked about on
[3:54:51.620 --> 3:54:54.180]  russian tv we haven't talked about that yet you're saying we now in your own
[3:54:54.180 --> 3:54:57.540]  words need a revolution why and what should that
[3:54:57.540 --> 3:55:00.100]  revolution look like against this fascism
[3:55:00.100 --> 3:55:03.940]  well we're asking for an intellectual revolution and that's the only thing that
[3:55:03.940 --> 3:55:06.900]  we can see changing this in the terms that
[3:55:06.900 --> 3:55:11.780]  the systems are totally corrupt we have a two-headed one-party system
[3:55:11.780 --> 3:55:15.060]  our our financial institutions wall street
[3:55:15.060 --> 3:55:18.420]  it's the criminal gangs i mean it's a dc heist
[3:55:18.420 --> 3:55:23.700]  the wall streets take it over washington and the media is monopolizing our minds
[3:55:23.700 --> 3:55:27.460]  with this moron talk they have these buffoons you know when i talk
[3:55:27.460 --> 3:55:30.820]  about you know fox i mean i'm not talking about
[3:55:30.820 --> 3:55:36.500]  you know people like uh a hannity or a royally i mean to me these guys are
[3:55:36.500 --> 3:55:40.340]  you know they were you know i there's nothing about them that i would support
[3:55:40.340 --> 3:55:43.780]  you know i want to make that really clear i was talking about just a group of
[3:55:43.780 --> 3:55:48.260]  people i know on on happy hour and and a few others
[3:55:48.260 --> 3:55:52.900]  but um it was so we have to stop this mind poison that they they keep
[3:55:52.900 --> 3:55:57.380]  killing us with and people my father may so rest in pieces to say to me
[3:55:57.380 --> 3:56:01.220]  when i would repeat anything that everybody else was saying he said to
[3:56:01.220 --> 3:56:06.500]  me in italian papagallo parrot stop repeating what everybody else is
[3:56:06.500 --> 3:56:10.900]  saying and think for yourself and this is a time when people need to think for
[3:56:10.900 --> 3:56:13.780]  themselves the only way that we can get out of
[3:56:13.780 --> 3:56:18.420]  this is by coming up with intelligent decisions rather than
[3:56:18.420 --> 3:56:21.700]  having the president go out on comedy shows
[3:56:21.700 --> 3:56:26.500]  and put out these spin and and and throwing out these one-line
[3:56:26.500 --> 3:56:29.860]  sound bites and making decisions based on that
[3:56:29.860 --> 3:56:32.820]  and the other president you know he didn't go on comedy shows
[3:56:32.820 --> 3:56:35.940]  but he had this whole sound bite thing down as well
[3:56:35.940 --> 3:56:39.060]  this is very weird a critical time in our nation
[3:56:39.060 --> 3:56:42.580]  and either the nation is going to go under in fascism
[3:56:42.580 --> 3:56:46.580]  and control or we can emerge as a better nation
[3:56:46.580 --> 3:56:50.260]  in terms of looking toward the future in a more positive way
[3:56:50.260 --> 3:56:55.300]  and saying that by the way uh one of the things as you know we have said
[3:56:55.300 --> 3:56:58.740]  is that the only thing that could get us out of the financial crisis
[3:56:58.740 --> 3:57:04.180]  is a productive capacity you're hearing now more and more again about coal
[3:57:04.180 --> 3:57:07.860]  fusion which a lot of people believe that was suppressed
[3:57:07.860 --> 3:57:12.420]  by the big energy companies and there's going to be an alternative energy and
[3:57:12.420 --> 3:57:14.980]  people should start looking in those directions
[3:57:14.980 --> 3:57:19.620]  for opportunities as well so in talking about it and
[3:57:19.620 --> 3:57:24.340]  an intellectual revolution these are the kind of things that we're talking
[3:57:24.340 --> 3:57:27.700]  about well i don't see how the tyrants are going to get
[3:57:27.700 --> 3:57:30.980]  away with what they're doing in closing as i interrupted you with a break
[3:57:30.980 --> 3:57:34.020]  real fast how bad's real estate going to get because you know i mean it's now
[3:57:34.020 --> 3:57:37.220]  coming out that it's just totally screwed as well it is and now you're going
[3:57:37.220 --> 3:57:40.980]  to start seeing as we've been saying the next shoe that's going to be falling
[3:57:40.980 --> 3:57:45.220]  is going to be a commercial real estate sector we just saw the second largest
[3:57:45.220 --> 3:57:49.220]  small developer go bankrupt general growth i love it
[3:57:49.220 --> 3:57:54.420]  bad year for generals isn't it general motors general growth about you know
[3:57:54.420 --> 3:57:58.900]  general malaise this thing is over they've over expanded they've over
[3:57:58.900 --> 3:58:02.900]  built you're going to see ghost malls popping up all over the country
[3:58:02.900 --> 3:58:06.980]  this is no time to invest now in real estate
[3:58:06.980 --> 3:58:11.300]  friendsresearch.com you can see him all over television radio you name it
