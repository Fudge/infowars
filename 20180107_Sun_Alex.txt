[00:00.000 --> 00:23.920]  Well, let me tell you, we are a man in the guns in the information war.
[00:23.920 --> 00:27.960]  We're having victory thanks to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, but I will tell you we
[00:27.960 --> 00:32.980]  are under sustained attack, not just in the media, but by operations behind the scenes
[00:32.980 --> 00:35.080]  that will soon be revealing.
[00:35.080 --> 00:40.040]  There is so much to get to, so much to break down here today.
[00:40.040 --> 00:47.040]  You know, I am rarely ashamed of myself, and I came up here two or three hours before
[00:47.040 --> 00:48.040]  the broadcast today.
[00:48.040 --> 00:51.960]  I don't normally do that on Sunday, I get ready at home, but it's so much preparation
[00:51.960 --> 00:57.320]  last night in the day for this broadcast because I don't normally get up on air and
[00:57.320 --> 01:00.800]  say that I'm ashamed of something I've done.
[01:00.800 --> 01:04.360]  And I don't do it to be self-deprecating, I don't do it as some type of apology stunt.
[01:04.360 --> 01:09.240]  That's why it's very proud of 95% of what I've done in my life.
[01:09.240 --> 01:15.760]  I do it because we need to really all of us think about this so that we're more conscious
[01:15.760 --> 01:22.440]  in our lives when we are especially involved in political operations.
[01:22.440 --> 01:27.440]  And that said, because I've got so much to cover today, at the start of the next segment,
[01:27.440 --> 01:35.880]  I'm just going to briefly get into Steve Bannon.
[01:35.880 --> 01:43.480]  I have a certain arrogance to me, and I don't even know how to quantify it.
[01:43.480 --> 01:51.240]  It's that I'm so anti-enfighting and so anti-talking crap behind people's backs.
[01:51.240 --> 02:00.920]  And so high-rope that I refuse to get involved in intrigue and palace intrigue and behind
[02:00.920 --> 02:07.080]  the scenes things and just try to project onto people that I've decided are in the liberty
[02:07.080 --> 02:10.520]  movement that they're good.
[02:10.520 --> 02:14.720]  When the evidence mounted and mounted and mounted and mounted and mounted and mounted,
[02:14.720 --> 02:18.520]  they were bad.
[02:18.520 --> 02:22.840]  I kind of did with these people that are into the secret or whatever, the Oprah Winfrey stuff,
[02:22.840 --> 02:24.360]  just saying it's all going to be okay.
[02:24.360 --> 02:31.760]  I got so positive because of interfacing with you, interfacing with my own intent, that
[02:31.760 --> 02:34.440]  I start projecting the positivity.
[02:34.440 --> 02:38.200]  And I can be super negative about the globalists because they admit they're devil-worshipping
[02:38.200 --> 02:39.200]  pedophiles.
[02:39.200 --> 02:42.480]  God, I've got stacks of news on that coming up.
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.680]  I get so focused on the globalists in Hollywood and Orthodox radical Islam and just all this
[02:47.680 --> 02:56.280]  stuff that I intellectually think, well, if I engage in infighting or exposing people
[02:56.280 --> 03:01.520]  that are doing bad in our movement, I'm adding to all this and I'm above it.
[03:01.520 --> 03:08.720]  So just as you can be super low involved in infighting, you can also be even lower not
[03:08.720 --> 03:12.600]  doing it and just ignoring like blinders on.
[03:12.600 --> 03:22.600]  I spent, I'm not going to exaggerate, even though it was my wife and I's first anniversary.
[03:22.600 --> 03:23.600]  She was like, what do you do?
[03:23.600 --> 03:32.600]  I spent five hours yesterday, five hours researching and I spent another good, it's not exaggerate,
[03:32.600 --> 03:37.440]  four hours this morning getting a crash course and Stephen Bannon and everything that happened
[03:37.440 --> 03:40.640]  and I got so angry.
[03:40.640 --> 03:44.160]  I remember saying on air, why didn't Matt Rudge warn us and I'm not lionizing Matt
[03:44.160 --> 03:45.160]  Rudge.
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.160]  I just have to say the truth.
[03:46.160 --> 03:48.560]  See, because everything I, that's my North Star, it's just the truth.
[03:48.560 --> 03:49.560]  My job's easy.
[03:49.560 --> 03:53.680]  Just tell the truth, even if it hurts me.
[03:53.680 --> 03:55.440]  Why didn't Matt Rudge call and warn me?
[03:55.440 --> 03:59.480]  You know, he come visit me, why didn't he warn me that Bannon was so horrible and he knew
[03:59.480 --> 04:03.240]  and I'll be honest, the last six months since Drudge started really exposing him, I just
[04:03.240 --> 04:04.240]  never really saw it.
[04:04.240 --> 04:05.240]  I never really paid him.
[04:05.240 --> 04:11.000]  A few times though, I did see it and was like, oh whatever, some of you, when if somebody
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.840]  really helped the country and only selflessly helped me and prove they really had good discernment,
[04:15.840 --> 04:21.240]  why didn't I, when Matt Rudge rang the alarm bell, and then I remember everything now,
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.040]  the behind the scenes stuff and Bannon trying to meet with me and all the weirdness and
[04:26.040 --> 04:27.920]  all the leaks were from him.
[04:27.920 --> 04:30.640]  He was the one undermining, like a Sith Lord.
[04:30.640 --> 04:38.040]  He was the one the whole time in there sabotaging Trump and as soon as he was gone, everything
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.000]  got better and we got the agenda through and they even had me on air bitching about Kelly
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.600]  and all these other, Jared Kushner when they were the ones actually helping Trump get the
[04:46.600 --> 04:49.160]  agenda through, because Trump's in charge.
[04:49.160 --> 04:55.680]  I mean, it was just like, it's few things that I feel embarrassed about and I do and
[04:55.680 --> 05:00.280]  I'm sharing it so we don't make the mistake again.
[05:00.280 --> 05:04.680]  The elusive Matt Drudge has hinted there may be a shake up at Breitbart News.
[05:04.680 --> 05:08.560]  He tweeted a photo of Andrew Breitbart with the accompanying text.
[05:08.560 --> 05:13.680]  The terrific Larry Salove and Susie Breitbart will take Breitbart into the fresh future.
[05:13.680 --> 05:18.640]  Has it really been 10 years since Andrew told me on Santa Monica Pier he was going to do
[05:18.640 --> 05:19.640]  it?
[05:19.640 --> 05:23.680]  His first hire, Alex Marlowe, became one of the best news editors in the world.
[05:23.680 --> 05:28.400]  The Washington Times reports that Salove was Andrew Breitbart's longtime friend and business
[05:28.400 --> 05:33.680]  partner, who became the president and CEO of Breitbart News after Andrew's sudden and
[05:33.680 --> 05:35.760]  tragic death in 2012.
[05:35.760 --> 05:40.160]  Although he was brought on initially to serve in a more advisory function, Bannon's influence
[05:40.160 --> 05:42.880]  has steered the site in recent years.
[05:42.880 --> 05:47.520]  After the president's verbal dressing down of his former staffer, it seems unlikely Steve
[05:47.520 --> 05:49.800]  Bannon will stay at the helm of Breitbart.
[05:49.800 --> 05:54.520]  Drudge's tweet suggests a decision has all but been made to oust Bannon and those who
[05:54.520 --> 05:57.840]  helped create Breitbart are taking back the reins.
[05:57.840 --> 05:59.840]  Leigh-Anne McAdoo, Infowars.com.
[06:27.840 --> 06:39.520]  The People Who's Manufacturing Jobs Have Left, who've been besieged by high-crime communities
[06:39.520 --> 06:43.160]  and who've been affected by a policy of uncontrolled immigration.
[06:43.160 --> 06:47.720]  Those voices, those experiences, don't get covered on this network.
[06:47.720 --> 06:52.720]  To prove the point, I was booked to talk about the very issues I'm just describing you're
[06:52.720 --> 06:55.720]  not even asking about them because they're not interesting facts to you.
[06:55.720 --> 06:57.920]  That's not true, I have plenty of questions in immigration.
[06:57.920 --> 07:00.520]  You've attempted to fill a buster by talking about your flight to the president.
[07:00.520 --> 07:02.880]  I want to ask you a question because you have to do it.
[07:02.880 --> 07:03.880]  No, don't be condescending.
[07:03.880 --> 07:04.880]  Jake.
[07:04.880 --> 07:05.880]  Stephen.
[07:05.880 --> 07:06.880]  The president and the White House.
[07:06.880 --> 07:08.880]  The reason why I want to talk about the president and the White House.
[07:08.880 --> 07:13.920]  Jake, the reason why I want to talk about the president's experiences, what I've seen
[07:13.920 --> 07:18.160]  with him traveling to meet dozens of foreign leaders, with his incredible work.
[07:18.160 --> 07:19.160]  Okay.
[07:19.160 --> 07:20.160]  You're not answering the questions.
[07:20.160 --> 07:21.160]  No, I understand.
[07:21.160 --> 07:24.720]  You have 24 hours a day of answering my materials and you're not going to give three minutes
[07:24.720 --> 07:25.720]  for the American people.
[07:25.720 --> 07:26.720]  I get it.
[07:26.720 --> 07:27.720]  The real experience of Donald Trump.
[07:27.720 --> 07:31.000]  There's one viewer that you care about right now and you're being obsequious, you're being
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.560]  a fact totem in order to please him, okay?
[07:33.560 --> 07:34.560]  You know who I care about.
[07:34.560 --> 07:35.560]  I think I've wasted enough of my viewers' time.
[07:35.560 --> 07:36.560]  You know who I care about.
[07:36.560 --> 07:37.560]  Thank you, Stephen.
[07:37.560 --> 07:42.240]  As Republicans lawmakers call for a judge at Jeff Sessions to resign, in a major reversal,
[07:42.240 --> 07:43.480]  Democrats are now coming to his defense.
[07:43.480 --> 07:44.480]  What changed?
[07:44.480 --> 07:47.000]  We'll ask the top Democrat.
[07:47.000 --> 07:59.560]  So that was Jake Tapper panicking this weekend and cutting the White House communications
[07:59.560 --> 08:03.120]  officer Stephen Miller off.
[08:03.120 --> 08:04.280]  And I've watched the whole interview.
[08:04.280 --> 08:11.360]  It was riveting to see him march into the devil's palace right into hell and stand up
[08:11.360 --> 08:14.200]  against those guys.
[08:14.200 --> 08:19.640]  And in the full clip, he gets into, hey, you're the ones that put out the fake quote that
[08:19.640 --> 08:24.440]  Trump directed General Flynn to meet months before he was even elected with the Russians
[08:24.440 --> 08:25.440]  knowing it was fake.
[08:25.440 --> 08:30.800]  You're the ones that reported on and on and on and on and on all this fake news and Tapper
[08:30.800 --> 08:31.800]  didn't want to discuss it.
[08:31.800 --> 08:32.800]  He said, you're not answering our questions.
[08:32.800 --> 08:38.240]  He'd already been there 20 minutes answering all the questions, but they didn't want somebody
[08:38.240 --> 08:39.720]  to stand up for truth.
[08:39.720 --> 08:45.960]  You know that when Larry King left CNN, he had about 8 million viewers tonight at his
[08:45.960 --> 08:46.960]  peak.
[08:46.960 --> 08:47.960]  He had about 20 million.
[08:47.960 --> 08:50.280]  It's one of the hottest shows ever.
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.040]  When Pierce Morgan left, he had about 400,000 viewers on a good night.
[08:55.040 --> 08:59.720]  I got there in the middle of it and he still had about a million and a half viewers.
[08:59.720 --> 09:04.640]  He had 3 million the night I was on 4 million the night after that 5 million, 6 million.
[09:04.640 --> 09:08.840]  And he went up to over 6 million in the week after, but didn't implode it because he was
[09:08.840 --> 09:13.720]  like a dying star or a dead cat bouncing.
[09:13.720 --> 09:17.200]  Why if somebody gave them the best ratings that show ever had?
[09:17.200 --> 09:18.280]  They admitted that in the news.
[09:18.280 --> 09:21.000]  They had the Nielsen ratings out at the end of the year 2013.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.140]  They said Alex Jones on Pierce Morgan was the number one ratings Pierce Morgan ever had.
[09:26.140 --> 09:29.040]  They didn't want meth head Hollywood stars.
[09:29.040 --> 09:31.960]  They wanted straight shooting, but I don't need to go on there to get that.
[09:31.960 --> 09:38.480]  We have videos with 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 million views every week, despite their censorship.
[09:38.480 --> 09:43.600]  The point was, if it was ratings they're looking for, why was I never back?
[09:43.600 --> 09:47.880]  Because they don't like the ball face, hey, I'm calling your curtain, I'm calling your
[09:47.880 --> 09:52.360]  Allison Wonderland, I'm calling your Wizard of Oz, Koto, pull back the curtain.
[09:52.360 --> 09:59.480]  They don't know what to do when a Stephen Miller marches in.
[09:59.480 --> 10:01.160]  Who by the way, I've now done my research.
[10:01.160 --> 10:02.160]  I'm just so busy.
[10:02.160 --> 10:03.640]  You haven't focused on King's court stuff.
[10:03.640 --> 10:10.520]  I did a crash course yesterday and today, read probably, probably read 200 articles,
[10:10.520 --> 10:16.120]  probably scanned another couple of hundred, probably watched a hundred videos, okay?
[10:16.120 --> 10:18.200]  Or more in the last week.
[10:18.200 --> 10:22.400]  And I figured out Stephen Miller is the guy that Trump likes.
[10:22.400 --> 10:23.400]  We don't know it.
[10:23.400 --> 10:27.640]  Stephen Miller is the guy that wrote the memos, that stayed up with Trump 18 hours a day.
[10:27.640 --> 10:28.640]  Bannon was never even there.
[10:28.640 --> 10:32.320]  He's so lazy on whatever he's doing with his body that he never gets seen.
[10:32.320 --> 10:34.680]  He's reclusive, very paranoid.
[10:34.680 --> 10:38.280]  It was Miller that could keep up with Trump when Trump was 70, now 71.
[10:38.280 --> 10:40.080]  It was Miller, 37 years old.
[10:40.080 --> 10:44.280]  Then I researched Miller and I remembered Miller because it's not about Miller even
[10:44.280 --> 10:46.960]  Trump, it's about their path and who they are.
[10:46.960 --> 10:51.640]  And this is a guy in high school that was anti-communist and it was against the left
[10:51.640 --> 10:53.800]  creating anti-white racism.
[10:53.800 --> 10:59.640]  He's a Jewish guy, but he recognizes race-based stuff and he comes from a liberal family and
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.680]  you know, from what I read, but he was like, oh my God, this is like Nazi, but it's against
[11:04.680 --> 11:05.680]  white people.
[11:05.680 --> 11:08.560]  So they call him a white nationalist because he's a guy that's anti-racist.
[11:08.560 --> 11:12.000]  He sounds like Martin Luther King, the actualist of Martin Luther King, but that's how far
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.800]  they've come.
[11:13.800 --> 11:16.720]  So here's Stephen Miller on there just telling the truth.
[11:16.720 --> 11:22.520]  And Jake Tapper, I mean, I watched the whole thing like twice and watched some of it three
[11:22.520 --> 11:23.520]  times.
[11:23.520 --> 11:29.720]  And the point was, is that he destroyed him and Tapper went to break early and didn't know
[11:29.720 --> 11:37.120]  what to do because a 31, 32 year old person who's actually immersed in things and researches
[11:37.120 --> 11:41.520]  everything had every angle of what they were about to try and what they were about to do.
[11:41.520 --> 11:47.160]  And then I began to see it was Miller would transcribe what the president said and say,
[11:47.160 --> 11:49.400]  what about this sir and add a point or two?
[11:49.400 --> 11:50.840]  And it was Miller.
[11:50.840 --> 11:54.760]  And what's crazy is, that's what's crazy is I know Trump isn't word for word copying
[11:54.760 --> 11:57.200]  my talking points or just truth.
[11:57.200 --> 11:58.560]  I'm so synced up.
[11:58.560 --> 12:04.080]  It's Miller I've been synced up with because I can say stuff at the same time I found Miller
[12:04.080 --> 12:08.360]  giving a press conference and it's the same thing because it's the truth.
[12:08.360 --> 12:13.640]  Hey, you know, you go, as soon as Miller heard about this book, he looks up, okay, who is
[12:13.640 --> 12:17.480]  this Michael Wolf, a known charlton, known yellow journalism.
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.320]  A guy quoted as hundreds of witnesses saying that he manufactures quotes.
[12:22.320 --> 12:23.320]  Okay.
[12:23.320 --> 12:26.760]  Oh, I witnesses in journalistic schools left and right say this guy manufactures quotes
[12:26.760 --> 12:31.840]  and is literally a wolf in journalistic clothing and is a total absolute charlton and banning
[12:31.840 --> 12:35.800]  letting man blah blah and then Miller says the exact same thing sometimes before me sometimes
[12:35.800 --> 12:42.000]  after because if we're looking at the same red fire engine, we're looking at this and
[12:42.000 --> 12:43.120]  see that's the difference.
[12:43.120 --> 12:47.040]  The globalist they put out a talking point that says the fire engine's purple or it's
[12:47.040 --> 12:48.600]  pink or it's black.
[12:48.600 --> 12:51.280]  No, it's flaming red and it's the same thing.
[12:51.280 --> 12:53.160]  It's like them saying Trump's insane.
[12:53.160 --> 12:54.800]  Trump's a failure.
[12:54.800 --> 12:55.800]  Trump's going down.
[12:55.800 --> 12:56.800]  Oh, really?
[12:56.800 --> 13:04.800]  This is out of the labor statistics bureau, ladies and gentlemen, record black employment,
[13:04.800 --> 13:09.960]  record white Hispanic employment, record stock market, record thousands of new companies
[13:09.960 --> 13:10.960]  coming back.
[13:10.960 --> 13:11.960]  Zero hedge was a great job.
[13:11.960 --> 13:16.280]  The story is on infowars.com number of black people not in labor force reaches all time.
[13:16.280 --> 13:22.440]  Hi, as with other BLS data, it is amazing how when you change the rules, everything
[13:22.440 --> 13:23.440]  looks better.
[13:23.440 --> 13:29.560]  The BLS reported black unemployment, 6.8 December at all time low, it's like 15 points under
[13:29.560 --> 13:31.120]  Obama at one point.
[13:31.120 --> 13:35.480]  That's kind of funny considering around 40% of working-age black people are not working.
[13:35.480 --> 13:38.680]  These statistics should not include the two to three million black men sitting in prison.
[13:38.680 --> 13:45.400]  And then it goes over again, judge a tree by its fruits and it goes on and on and on and
[13:45.400 --> 13:50.680]  you know how happy I was when I learned when my top CPA came in and he said, Alex, Trump
[13:50.680 --> 13:52.960]  has raised taxes on you and me.
[13:52.960 --> 13:58.160]  We're both big libertarian patriots, but he said, doesn't matter, we're all going to
[13:58.160 --> 14:00.960]  be more successful and so is America.
[14:00.960 --> 14:05.160]  Massive cuts to the middle class and poor, massive incentives for factories, massive
[14:05.160 --> 14:08.520]  bonuses coming, doubling the child credit to help families.
[14:08.520 --> 14:12.720]  This is $13,000 for the average family, not to mention what happens in the economy.
[14:12.720 --> 14:18.000]  My CPA who's on the board of some major corporations, he estimates that this is going to people
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.480]  that want to work after you add the tax cuts and money up to $32,000 per family of working-medium
[14:25.480 --> 14:26.480]  women.
[14:26.480 --> 14:30.960]  Let me tell you something, call me a cheese ball, call me a nerd, call me an idiot, call
[14:30.960 --> 14:32.720]  me a mark because I'm not a sociopath.
[14:32.720 --> 14:38.200]  I feel real good promoting something that does that and to know that my property taxes
[14:38.200 --> 14:41.720]  got checked up and my state income tax, we don't have it in Texas, but they have it under
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.240]  the franchise deal, so I do have a property tax, most people don't, at a certain level
[14:46.240 --> 14:52.560]  you get it, can know that I'm paying more taxes, I pay 2% less on income tax, but way
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.600]  more on everything else with a $10,000 cap on all state taxes, which I know will then
[14:57.600 --> 15:04.200]  supercharge the economy and make states lower taxes, it's just genius what's just happened.
[15:04.200 --> 15:07.560]  There was some pork and some Christmas tree stuff there under the Christmas tree, but
[15:07.560 --> 15:12.440]  it's just so exciting, ladies and gentlemen, to be alive right now and to see this happening
[15:12.440 --> 15:17.880]  and to know that the globalists want us at each other's throats, they want us poor, they
[15:17.880 --> 15:24.800]  want us dumbed down and to see Trump delivering like this and to see them panicking so hard
[15:24.800 --> 15:29.160]  and to then, because I don't do research on castle intrigue and the people themselves
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.320]  once I did it on Trump that was it, I do it on what's happening with the big global picture,
[15:33.320 --> 15:38.800]  the globalist plan, where they're taking us, how we stop that, prosperity, free market,
[15:38.800 --> 15:41.840]  family, but I don't sit there like everybody else does and obsess over because I already
[15:41.840 --> 15:47.200]  got my big platform, I'm not trying to get into a platform, but then I got played by
[15:47.200 --> 15:51.160]  Bannon and others by just going, oh, Bannon's the nationalist, he's the one defending it,
[15:51.160 --> 15:56.800]  he was the one sabotaging it and leaking everything the whole time and we now know and understand
[15:56.800 --> 16:02.600]  it, so you learn something every day, Matt and Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt,
[16:02.600 --> 16:03.600]  go ahead.
[16:03.600 --> 16:07.840]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of Enforced
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.240]  and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely
[16:12.240 --> 16:17.520]  fantastic and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the Enforced.
[16:17.520 --> 16:22.080]  It might seem like a simple thing, but they particularly these slogan t-shirts that you
[16:22.080 --> 16:24.880]  guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[16:24.880 --> 16:29.960]  Well thank you, my favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't
[16:29.960 --> 16:34.400]  tread on me and it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake and then it's got the American
[16:34.400 --> 16:38.720]  flag Enforced.com on the right arm, I mean that's a great way just to meet like-minded
[16:38.720 --> 16:44.560]  people and spread the word and also exercise free speech and the newest one is trigger

[16:50.560 --> 16:56.400]  sign and then Enforced.com on the back, that is the new shirt of the month available exclusively

[18:30.600 --> 18:35.040]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation like canning or dehydrating,

[19:00.240 --> 19:06.600]  Brett Smith, author of Thump the First Bundred Days, explained to people about Thump and
[19:06.600 --> 19:09.000]  why this is an important book and how it ties into things.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.280]  And I just thought to myself, you know, this is brilliant.
[19:11.280 --> 19:16.000]  This is the ultimate juxtaposition of what everyone says about the president.
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.840]  You know, they say that he's a racist, misogynist, sexist, bigoted, homophobic Nazi.
[19:20.840 --> 19:25.760]  So what better way to counter that than by turning him into an incredibly cute, lovable,
[19:25.760 --> 19:26.760]  fluffy little bunny.
[19:26.760 --> 19:29.480]  It's got that fun, rhyming structure to it.
[19:29.480 --> 19:30.480]  It's actually hilarious.
[19:30.480 --> 19:33.240]  I was cracking up reading the whole book, my wife was cracking up.
[19:33.240 --> 19:35.920]  And it's a great book for adults, it's a great book for children.
[19:35.920 --> 19:37.160]  We're selling the book.
[19:37.160 --> 19:43.000]  We've got it bundled as well here with a one-off poster that's a collector's item.
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.080]  Both of these, the book, the graphic novel, and the poster are $29.95 that helps support
[19:48.080 --> 19:49.080]  us.
[19:49.080 --> 19:53.440]  So get the book Thump the First 100 Days and Alan Jones and Thump the Art of InfoWars
[19:53.440 --> 20:19.440]  for a limited edition at infowarsstore.com.
[20:23.440 --> 20:41.840]  Here's what happened.
[20:41.840 --> 20:46.940]  A lot of corporate interest crept into the western world and the third world, the old
[20:46.940 --> 20:52.120]  world as well, with high-tech radio and television and then movies.
[20:52.120 --> 20:55.840]  And people that had never experienced it before fell hook, line, and sinker for the
[20:55.840 --> 20:57.680]  propaganda that was embedded in it.
[20:57.680 --> 21:02.440]  Because at first the propaganda was pretty pro-family, pro-God, pro-sovereignty.
[21:02.440 --> 21:05.200]  They knew how to get you addicted first.
[21:05.200 --> 21:09.920]  But the globalists took the fact that they had America under a spell for the fact that
[21:09.920 --> 21:16.960]  they had intimidated America or the human spirit, whether you're in Mexico or South
[21:16.960 --> 21:22.600]  Africa or Germany or Japan, it doesn't matter.
[21:22.600 --> 21:23.600]  Because they're cowards.
[21:23.600 --> 21:24.600]  They're scumbags.
[21:24.600 --> 21:29.080]  So they think you're operating according to fear instead of being an open, loving person
[21:29.080 --> 21:32.200]  who's not perfect but has good will for people.
[21:32.200 --> 21:35.200]  And so they study evil.
[21:35.200 --> 21:38.480]  They study ways to oppress people.
[21:38.480 --> 21:42.960]  And they think we're fools because we don't do that because we're God-fearing.
[21:42.960 --> 21:48.520]  They don't have a connection to God, so they don't spiritually, when they even think about
[21:48.520 --> 21:54.160]  something evil, have that recoiling, which is a fear of God, not a fear of man.
[21:54.160 --> 21:59.840]  And this is very important because criminology shows this, the research shows this I've interviewed.
[21:59.840 --> 22:04.040]  As many of you have heard of the top psychiatrist and psychologist for serial killers, you name
[22:04.040 --> 22:05.040]  it.
[22:05.040 --> 22:12.160]  The more evil you are, the more programmed, there's only maybe 20 different types of
[22:12.160 --> 22:14.280]  evil people.
[22:14.280 --> 22:19.280]  And it's beyond the tabletop psychology or pop psychology, you see.
[22:19.280 --> 22:21.080]  It's the real criminology.
[22:21.080 --> 22:26.120]  And people that are into it are shook up because if you were an atheist before, you become
[22:26.120 --> 22:30.880]  a religious person very, very quickly because you realize you're facing a program.
[22:30.880 --> 22:37.200]  You're facing something that people are manifesting, that's shining through them.
[22:37.200 --> 22:41.440]  It's like mob psychology is proven, everybody's happy at a big party, everything's good.
[22:41.440 --> 22:43.360]  Whatever starts going bad, it gets real negative.
[22:43.360 --> 22:51.520]  But it's not just the behavior, it's a spiritual transmission, it's a internet of minds that
[22:51.520 --> 22:53.120]  is transmitting.
[22:53.120 --> 22:59.560]  And the globalists know about this and spend all their time trying to manipulate that for
[22:59.560 --> 23:05.680]  their own personal power instead of empowering everybody and then themselves rising.
[23:05.680 --> 23:11.400]  And that's the difference between a follower of God and a follower of Satan.
[23:11.400 --> 23:12.760]  Satan wants it all.
[23:12.760 --> 23:14.240]  Satan doesn't want free will.
[23:14.240 --> 23:23.120]  And so Satan is a delusional narcissist, borderline personality disorder psychotic who can't even
[23:23.120 --> 23:30.840]  imagine what it's like to be in the real world inside the utopia that is God's mind.
[23:30.840 --> 23:34.040]  You've already been delivered, you've already been successful.
[23:34.040 --> 23:39.760]  You already have the keys of the kingdom, you already understand it.
[23:39.760 --> 23:49.200]  The psychopath, the devil whisperer thinks that you're weak because you don't want to
[23:49.200 --> 23:54.640]  tear people apart and then they can never understand once good people finally come after
[23:54.640 --> 23:56.640]  them, what's happening?
[23:56.640 --> 24:01.560]  You're supposed to be afraid of me, I'm supposed to rule you, no, you are only the
[24:01.560 --> 24:06.560]  test to keep the people faithful.
[24:06.560 --> 24:18.320]  Now that said, there's a manifestation happening in a big way where Hollywood is admitting
[24:18.320 --> 24:22.000]  it's satanic, Hollywood is admitting it's pedophilic.
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.600]  They're having major newspapers in the UK, say here's Sex Manuals, Have Sexual Kids,
[24:26.600 --> 24:32.160]  The Biggest Paper in London, The Metro.
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.480]  That's their attempt when we expose them to go, okay, normalize, we're not bad, let
[24:36.480 --> 24:39.280]  us do what we're doing.
[24:39.280 --> 24:43.200]  And that's why you see Chelsea Clinton tweeting the Church of Satan, how cool she thinks they
[24:43.200 --> 24:47.240]  are, how she likes him and then retweeting him last week and then saying, oh, I'm not
[24:47.240 --> 24:48.240]  a satanist.
[24:48.240 --> 24:52.520]  Yeah, we've seen the spirit cooking email sweetheart.
[24:52.520 --> 24:58.160]  Only a bug-eyed, slack-jawed, genetically fallen sack of garbage like you would want
[24:58.160 --> 25:03.000]  to believe me, sweetheart, you're spiritually ugly, we know why you're in satanism.
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.160]  And I don't say that to be mean, I just want people to realize there's not power in the
[25:07.160 --> 25:09.720]  devil, there's enslavement and there's failure.
[25:09.720 --> 25:18.880]  So there's a powerful article that is at Hannity.com, you guys got me the Daily Beast
[25:18.880 --> 25:20.160]  and that's great.
[25:20.160 --> 25:24.880]  And I think I sent the clip to them, maybe it didn't come through, but if you just type
[25:24.880 --> 25:34.160]  in this exact headline, it'll come up, give that exact headline, it is, Democrats blame
[25:34.160 --> 25:42.520]  the rise of satanism on Donald Trump, and I'll pull up on my phone right here.
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.320]  And I know you're working on it, I'm saying I've got it right here in the text messages
[25:45.320 --> 25:46.320]  I sent.
[25:46.320 --> 25:49.000]  It's great, I asked for it, I've got a couple other ones.
[25:49.000 --> 25:56.640]  And they said, oh, the reason satanism is exploding in the left, and the reason all
[25:56.640 --> 26:01.000]  this is happening is Trump has made people so desperate they're turning to the devil.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.640]  No, they already turned to the devil.
[26:05.640 --> 26:15.400]  And my point is, is that this is the type of crazy garbage that they're pushing.
[26:15.400 --> 26:19.360]  This is who they think we are.
[26:19.360 --> 26:25.800]  This is how dumb they think we are.
[26:25.800 --> 26:33.480]  And it goes on and on and on and on from there.
[26:33.480 --> 26:40.040]  So when you look at that, and you think about that mindset, and you think about people that
[26:40.040 --> 26:42.440]  are, and we'll have the article next segment for you.
[26:42.440 --> 26:49.640]  When you think about just how incredibly turned over to selfishness these people are, then
[26:49.640 --> 27:03.360]  it makes total sense when President Trump is doing all these amazing things, and empowering
[27:03.360 --> 27:07.920]  the average person, they want you dependent, not independent, then you understand the LA
[27:07.920 --> 27:08.920]  Times article.
[27:08.920 --> 27:09.920]  Let's put it up on screen.
[27:09.920 --> 27:10.920]  Thanks for finding it, crew.
[27:10.920 --> 27:18.720]  A new generation of LA satanist finds community and blasphemous times.
[27:18.720 --> 27:24.640]  And it gets into how they believe they're turning themselves over to pure evil to counter
[27:24.640 --> 27:25.960]  the evil that is Trump.
[27:25.960 --> 27:33.080]  LA Times article suggests Trump is driving people into satanism.
[27:33.080 --> 27:37.960]  Now I see the news every day, and it tends to be the most beautiful women and the most
[27:37.960 --> 27:43.040]  handsome men who really get on this power trip about themselves, that they're supposed
[27:43.040 --> 27:47.440]  to be movie stars, or they're supposed to be incredibly powerful.
[27:47.440 --> 27:53.400]  And then because you're a beautiful Hungarian woman and you're a handsome German man, but
[27:53.400 --> 27:58.040]  you didn't get the movie roles, and you didn't get the, and it didn't happen, that you believe
[27:58.040 --> 27:59.040]  doesn't matter.
[27:59.040 --> 28:01.080]  Satan will love you when you enter hell.
[28:01.080 --> 28:07.360]  So the Daily Mail reports on a woman and her husband on their wedding honeymoon, splitting
[28:07.360 --> 28:13.000]  their wrist and committing suicide together in Spain last week, or it was Greece, I'm
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  going from memory.
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  You can pull that up.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.600]  It's linked on infowars.com.
[28:17.600 --> 28:22.080]  But the point is, you look at this young woman, and she's a beautiful young woman, he's a
[28:22.080 --> 28:29.920]  good looking guy, and the power trip is so strong that they don't feel like they're cool
[28:29.920 --> 28:33.000]  that somehow if they hurt themselves, that'll give them real power.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.400]  Now I'll give it to them.
[28:34.400 --> 28:37.840]  Every Satanist will kill a little kid to think, well, you get real power once you do these
[28:37.840 --> 28:41.880]  horrible things, at least to get the power they kill themselves, which shows they weren't
[28:41.880 --> 28:43.680]  true Satanists.
[28:43.680 --> 28:48.360]  I think they had so much humanity in them that they didn't see that their humanity
[28:48.360 --> 28:50.080]  ordered them to kill themselves.
[28:50.080 --> 28:55.360]  And that's why you shouldn't dabble in Satanism, because your body, your subconscious will
[28:55.360 --> 28:56.440]  order you to kill yourself.

[33:02.960 --> 33:11.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.560 --> 33:16.560]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:16.560 --> 33:28.960]  Watch me, watch me, I got it, watch me, I got it, hey, I got something that makes me want
[33:28.960 --> 33:38.960]  to shout, I got something that tells me what it's all about, I got some and I'm super bad,
[33:38.960 --> 33:54.000]  I got some and I'm super bad, now I gotta move, that tells me what to do, sometimes I
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.360]  expect to shoot.
[33:59.360 --> 34:05.480]  I'm a little bit late getting back to this segment because we got CNN, Fox News, MSNBC,
[34:05.480 --> 34:11.020]  got mainstream dinosaur media on the control room and I saw the weekend fox show comparing
[34:11.020 --> 34:18.300]  Michael Wolf, who is literally the BuzzFeed of individual reporters.
[34:18.300 --> 34:22.940]  I mean BuzzFeed has a long train of made-up stories and edited tapes and fraud
[34:23.500 --> 34:30.140]  They've been sued and lost lawsuits. They're going bankrupt because of it the PP gay that just goes off the stuff about me
[34:30.140 --> 34:34.800]  Just incredible horse winner. That's why I'm not worried about it. It's like there's not much
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.420]  I'm actually embarrassed of my life and what have they already made up. It just gets crazy
[34:39.180 --> 34:41.180]  But they were comparing
[34:42.100 --> 34:44.420]  Michael Wolf to dr. Evil
[34:44.420 --> 34:48.860]  At least dr. Evil goes out and actually takes people on. No, he doesn't look dr. Evil
[34:48.860 --> 34:54.220]  There was one photo I saw on Friday morning on my phone of him actually smiling. You can't find wolf
[34:54.860 --> 34:59.380]  Anywhere somebody finds it email because I couldn't find it again to show tips at info wars calm
[34:59.380 --> 35:03.740]  Nobody could find the author of this made-up book this piece of garbage this pile of garbage
[35:05.060 --> 35:09.280]  Nobody can find a photo of me smiling so I I made the point. It looks like Brian Stelter's father
[35:09.280 --> 35:15.280]  And I did this tongue-and-cheek piece about Brian Stelter runs your life Brian Stelter wants to control you
[35:15.280 --> 35:17.880]  But I said I mean mainstream media. He's an archetype
[35:17.920 --> 35:24.040]  Well, they added it together and said that I literally say Brian Stelter runs your life and Brian Stelter brings your children's blood
[35:24.040 --> 35:28.800]  I said they drink your children's future. He pushes lies on the family. So he's drinking our children's blood
[35:29.560 --> 35:33.680]  But if we could put the image up that I've seen of the two side-by-side
[35:33.680 --> 35:40.800]  Stelter put out a tweet with this tiny CNN fell show and said glad you put out a good photo of me
[35:40.800 --> 35:42.800]  That was the whole point of the rant
[35:44.320 --> 35:46.320]  Who in the hell
[35:47.240 --> 35:49.240]  That looks like a
[35:50.120 --> 35:52.120]  Somebody had a central casting as a
[35:52.800 --> 35:58.640]  Not a serial killer and I'm not saying Brian Stelter's a child molester. He just looks like in my mind
[35:58.880 --> 36:02.960]  What a child molester looks like? I'm sure he's a great family guy and everything
[36:02.960 --> 36:04.960]  at Wolf
[36:05.160 --> 36:09.840]  Looks like a slime ball in this photo, but I mean if I find the photo of him smiling
[36:09.840 --> 36:13.720]  I mean, it's like hair on the back of your neck stands up
[36:13.720 --> 36:17.560]  But but let's not just say what they look like because you can say I look like a child molester
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.600]  Okay, you could say Bugs Bunny looks like one, but I look like one. Let's put my mugshot on
[36:23.360 --> 36:28.840]  Wikipedia and let's say do you look at that guy? What do you think that guy's gonna do? I mean who who sits there?
[36:28.840 --> 36:33.720]  Pull Stelter back up for a moment for me because again, if you're a radio listener, you're like show me
[36:33.800 --> 36:36.480]  Yes, we're a radio TV show
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.760]  I was the first to do it going back but on there 23 years but going back 18 years ago
[36:40.760 --> 36:44.080]  I began to not just simulcast a webcam. I began to simulcast
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.640]  Video or tapes of what I did so people could see what I was saying
[36:49.120 --> 36:52.280]  If someone doesn't know and this is a powerful image
[36:52.280 --> 36:54.800]  But if you just kind of back it out roots off the head as well
[36:54.800 --> 37:03.040]  Because he's known to shave his head just to look old. This is what a joke. He is. Can you imagine actually smiling like this and
[37:04.120 --> 37:06.680]  Thinking it makes you look credible for TV viewers. Here it is. I
[37:12.840 --> 37:14.040]  Mean
[37:14.040 --> 37:20.920]  It's it's the Joker, but that's what I've learned about sociopath psychopaths and globalist is they always go I
[37:20.920 --> 37:24.880]  Can't even make the face wolf does and let me try to make it and they'll use it against me
[37:24.880 --> 37:29.040]  It's just ingenious, but I really get the spirit. I see I hate America hate freedom love the lie
[37:29.040 --> 37:35.160]  I have a real low self-esteem level. I'm a piece of garbage. I want to prove everybody. I've you know got the big wave
[37:35.160 --> 37:37.160]  Oh, so let me just try I
[37:37.960 --> 37:39.960]  Can't even do it just like
[37:43.920 --> 37:45.920]  Okay, I cannot
[37:45.920 --> 37:51.320]  These are the creepiest damn people. I would not if my waiter walked up and looked like this
[37:51.320 --> 37:54.400]  I would leave they tried to sell me a car. I would run if I was a woman
[37:56.720 --> 38:03.600]  And somebody walked up to me like stelter and I mean imagine you're posing for your CNN photo and this is what you do
[38:03.600 --> 38:05.600]  Look imagine just
[38:09.280 --> 38:13.200]  I'm Brian stelter. Hello. Hope you're doing Walmart
[38:13.200 --> 38:18.600]  He doesn't know how psychotic he looks. Maybe he does. I'm powerful
[38:18.600 --> 38:24.000]  I am Brian stelter and maybe the executives above him looking even more jack-o-lantern face
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.480]  I mean, that's what I'm saying. It's just my gut my gut hates these guys and then of course what flows out of their mouth
[38:30.480 --> 38:32.480]  It's really a giant ash
[38:32.960 --> 38:40.320]  The diarrhea that comes out of their asses is excuse me. I'm trying to stop. I just have to be honest with a filth the froth
[38:40.320 --> 38:43.800]  That comes out of their mouth is just
[38:45.080 --> 38:47.080]  Unbelievable I
[38:47.680 --> 38:50.920]  Had some really heavy stuff. I was gonna cover and I've got stacks of news here
[38:50.920 --> 38:57.740]  It just it just comes down to this fundamental thing that can you imagine being the type of globalist tart that stelter is
[38:58.480 --> 39:06.040]  That he literally posed for publicity photos and half of them. He looks like a serial killer mugshot
[39:06.040 --> 39:12.840]  Okay, I mean, can you I mean if anybody cuz I joke around sometimes to take photos that look creepy as a joke and
[39:13.040 --> 39:17.640]  The media runs with him. Can you imagine as your official publicity photo?
[39:18.240 --> 39:20.240]  putting this out
[39:21.360 --> 39:25.320]  Even do it it's like a it's like so fake it's like a
[39:29.040 --> 39:31.040]  You can trust me
[39:31.040 --> 39:35.520]  Ha ha ha ha just let us run your kids. Let us have your families. Oh
[39:37.640 --> 39:43.480]  Economy's not doing well Trump's you look at that. Look oh, oh my god. Oh, I'm not just saying it
[39:43.480 --> 39:48.720]  He he blessed mom after stelter. He just is so evil looking at my soul
[39:49.160 --> 39:55.960]  Has serious pain looking at it. There's only one other person makes me more nauseous and that's Hillary Clinton
[39:55.960 --> 40:00.360]  But look at the entitlement the surety
[40:00.760 --> 40:06.760]  The I've made it. I've been embraced from the black wings the new order and I'm here and I'm gonna rape your mind
[40:06.760 --> 40:08.760]  And oh god, it's so much fun
[40:14.160 --> 40:16.160]  I'm gonna be a good boy now
[40:16.160 --> 40:21.360]  I've got really important pertinent notes. I wrote I really write notes for the show, but I've got some important stuff
[40:21.360 --> 40:23.360]  I want to say in the next segment
[40:23.360 --> 40:25.360]  And I've got a bunch of clips
[40:25.360 --> 40:29.400]  When we had a clock in here, but I've heard that computer broke down. We're gonna get it back someday
[40:29.840 --> 40:31.840]  Can you got what we got three minutes to break? I?
[40:32.280 --> 40:38.220]  Want to play one more clip here just to be positive and look at somebody that comes off as genuine like the president and that's
[40:38.720 --> 40:41.720]  You may have always liked that we now learn was the through brain of
[40:42.040 --> 40:46.840]  Bannon that Brandon took credit for the guy that actually wrote all the stuff that Trump added to I mean
[40:46.840 --> 40:48.840]  I'm saying it wasn't Trump, but it was
[40:48.880 --> 40:50.880]  Trump resonates with Stephen Miller and
[40:50.880 --> 40:57.240]  So since you guys are telling me how long I have a long guy up two minutes. Thank you. I'm gonna go ahead and play
[40:58.320 --> 41:01.880]  White House age Stephen Miller calls Bannon's comments grotesque here it is
[41:02.720 --> 41:07.280]  President Trump of the White House have been calling the Russia investigation a witch hunt and a nothing burger
[41:07.440 --> 41:13.800]  But obviously in this new Michael Wolf book fire and fury Bannon offered a different take on the Trump Tower meeting
[41:14.160 --> 41:19.040]  Between Donald Trump Jr. Jared Kushner Paul Manafort and these and these other officials including a Russian lawyer
[41:19.040 --> 41:21.640]  He called it treasonous and unpatriotic
[41:21.640 --> 41:28.600]  And he said that quote the chance that Don Jr. Did not walk these Jemos up to his father's office on the 26th floor is
[41:29.520 --> 41:35.600]  Zero did President Trump meet with any so-called I'm gonna come back from break and play this all but
[41:36.200 --> 41:40.840]  No one's even from Mueller ever said that and that's the thing I sort of started the show with this
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.360]  I said back when this all broke on Wednesday or Thursday. It seems like a lifetime ago
[41:45.360 --> 41:50.800]  I said, why is it Bannon saying he's misquoted by a known charlatan and why is he doing this shows?
[41:50.800 --> 41:56.000]  He's behind it. He never even walked back to clips. He apologized today and said I'm sorry. It was taken wrong
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  I think these people are all great
[41:59.280 --> 42:05.600]  It it's it's exactly what you do if you were a charlatan, which is what we already know, which is what we know about the leaking
[42:06.080 --> 42:08.080]  and everything else but
[42:08.760 --> 42:11.320]  again, it is grotesque
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.600]  To be brought into something and then the whole time be leaking to the media
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.940]  Acting like you're not doing it and then posed everybody. I'm just so glad a few months ago
[42:21.760 --> 42:27.840]  Three four months ago, whatever it was whenever Bannon wanted me to toadie up to New York and come into a meeting with him
[42:28.720 --> 42:30.600]  that I didn't go
[42:30.600 --> 42:32.600]  Roger Stone was happy to go I sent him
[42:33.400 --> 42:38.520]  and Roger's a nice guy and has not told anybody what went on the meeting but
[42:38.520 --> 42:45.840]  I'm so sick of being holding confidence man. He just said let's just say this Roger Stones never liked Bannon
[42:45.920 --> 42:48.640]  Which makes it worse the stone and I?
[42:49.120 --> 42:56.080]  Smoked a lot of Bannon's BS dope. I don't mean cannabis. I mean his Bravo Sierra. We'll be back. Stay with us

[46:55.320 --> 46:57.600]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[46:57.600 --> 47:06.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:06.240 --> 47:22.000]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news it's Alex Jones
[47:28.600 --> 47:32.000]  Welcome back I'm Alex Jones your host news wars dot com
[47:32.000 --> 47:37.600]  President planet dot com info wars dot com about to get into some hard news here
[47:37.600 --> 47:41.600]  But it was the crew that pointed this out and that's how the zeitgeist works
[47:41.600 --> 47:43.900]  I saw this last night this morning doing research
[47:44.800 --> 47:50.560]  Into a bunch of different issues that Jared Fogle the former subway guy that convicted pedophile
[47:53.360 --> 48:00.160]  Listers noticed that when I kept showing him and I didn't know this was a meme already online creepy Jared Fogle
[48:00.160 --> 48:02.160]  Creepy Brian Stelter
[48:02.960 --> 48:08.800]  Creepy Joe Biden that the guys look like they could be brothers very very close and again
[48:08.800 --> 48:14.160]  I must say anything about Brian Stelter's a yellow journalist a globalist in my view of fraud
[48:14.480 --> 48:20.520]  I'm just saying why do these people all look the same. Can we put Michael wolf up on screen?
[48:21.680 --> 48:23.200]  Let's put a wolf up again
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.320]  I found one photo of Friday morning of wolf smiling and no one can find it but just it's it's lucky
[48:28.320 --> 48:35.520]  It's he's like it's his dead that there's a self-assuredness a pleasure and enjoyment about them and everything that comes out of them as a fraud
[48:36.400 --> 48:38.400]  So let's put up my mugshot
[48:39.200 --> 48:41.760]  I don't normally put out things that aren't true on purpose
[48:42.560 --> 48:46.320]  But when I do put out things that aren't exactly right. What wasn't wrong. I was asking the question
[48:47.440 --> 48:50.560]  About a week and a half ago. I took the mugshot photo
[48:50.560 --> 48:57.280]  Or the I guess passport photo to go to Russia. I mean, I've been here and I worked for Russia for three years and
[48:57.760 --> 49:01.440]  Congressional hearings and all and it's all falling apart and it's not true and I've ever been to Russia
[49:01.760 --> 49:06.240]  I've never been to Eastern Europe yet been to Europe many times. So I thought okay. Well, let's let's get a visa
[49:06.240 --> 49:10.560]  But like any other country out in the US you got to go months before and get a visa
[49:10.560 --> 49:13.200]  And they want me to go on national TV and speak to the universe. She's much other stuff
[49:13.200 --> 49:15.600]  I'm gonna go promote americana and free market over there
[49:15.600 --> 49:19.680]  You know 30 years ago the CIA would have paid me to do it but now it's called treason. So
[49:22.080 --> 49:25.360]  It was crazy without even looking I saw
[49:26.240 --> 49:30.640]  When I typed my name into Google do a search to see what the latest hit piece was because I've monitored every few hours
[49:31.200 --> 49:36.080]  I saw my image from from what I'd taken as as the as the shot here in the office
[49:36.640 --> 49:40.640]  Going down the Russian embassy in Houston and I was like, how is my
[49:41.360 --> 49:43.360]  passport photo
[49:43.360 --> 49:47.920]  Passport photo for a Russian visa. How is that?
[49:51.120 --> 49:54.880]  On Wikipedia and then they went Alex, you don't know how to read Wikipedia the crew told me
[49:55.200 --> 49:59.280]  It's Michael Zimmerman one of our great video editors and researchers going to go to Russia with us
[49:59.680 --> 50:01.840]  He went and helped you know put in the stuff of the visas
[50:02.240 --> 50:06.560]  He thought it'd be a better photo for you in Wikipedia. He did it. So I had tweeted out
[50:06.560 --> 50:12.880]  Last night, uh, this is weird a week ago or so. We took this photo for me to go to Russia
[50:13.840 --> 50:17.360]  And then now it's on Wikipedia and now I know why so it's an authorized photo
[50:18.160 --> 50:20.660]  But that's an example the left hand. I don't know what the right hand's doing
[50:22.160 --> 50:24.160]  But let's just put me back up on screen
[50:24.320 --> 50:25.840]  But let's just look I mean
[50:25.840 --> 50:29.440]  Let's be honest if you're a radio listener, you obviously can't see it in fours.com first. Let's show
[50:29.920 --> 50:32.800]  Does that guy look like he wants to screw you over?
[50:32.800 --> 50:34.800]  Or
[50:36.800 --> 50:38.800]  Does that guy look like
[50:38.800 --> 50:41.360]  He wants to break people's necks and screw people over
[50:42.320 --> 50:44.880]  And the reason I raise that is there's a bunch of studies on this
[50:44.880 --> 50:49.600]  But a big one came out last week out of the Journal of Science and several others but one last week where
[50:50.560 --> 50:57.440]  Within an hour to two hours if you've been affected by bacteria where they did this in the studies or a virus you're it's not even replicating
[50:59.200 --> 51:01.200]  It hasn't even spread yet
[51:01.200 --> 51:03.200]  Almost a hundred percent of the time
[51:04.400 --> 51:06.880]  Respondents at universities could tell you were sick
[51:07.920 --> 51:12.400]  Just by looking at a photo taken between an hour and two hours after you were infected
[51:13.200 --> 51:16.320]  Now, isn't that amazing? It's like it's like I said last week
[51:16.800 --> 51:20.400]  Trump has this famous quote where he says the deepest thing I ever did was learned to be shallow
[51:20.720 --> 51:24.000]  These two I sit there and over analyze stuff now and learn to scope my first approximation
[51:24.320 --> 51:26.400]  So let's put brian stelter back up if we can't
[51:26.400 --> 51:31.120]  Let's put michael wolf back up not just their history of lies and bs and this info
[51:31.360 --> 51:35.360]  But let's I mean look at that guy if you walked into a friend's house
[51:35.680 --> 51:38.640]  And there was a party and a dude walked up and smiled at you like that
[51:39.120 --> 51:44.320]  I personally would go to my friend and say who the hell is this? I mean if I look at the
[51:45.120 --> 51:47.360]  convicted pedophile that is the former head of
[51:48.560 --> 51:50.560]  the former spokesperson for
[51:50.560 --> 51:51.760]  subway
[51:51.760 --> 51:57.760]  Who's in prison enjoying a footlong right now if I looked at that I would say holy Toledo
[51:58.480 --> 52:00.480]  Run don't walk
[52:01.440 --> 52:03.680]  But see I'm not saying and I don't believe
[52:04.400 --> 52:06.480]  Stelter is a convicted pedophile like this guy
[52:07.120 --> 52:13.680]  It's a spirit of a predator is what I'm saying and at a gut level now. I'm learning at 43 about be 44
[52:14.640 --> 52:16.640]  To do something I've
[52:16.640 --> 52:20.720]  When I was like 15 I never followed my gut when I was 20 I followed it sometimes
[52:20.720 --> 52:26.880]  When I was 30 I followed it a third of the time when I was 35 maybe half the time. I'm now becoming
[52:29.040 --> 52:32.320]  A person completely around with my gut I go off research. I cover it but
[52:33.360 --> 52:38.160]  What's happened is and it's actually incredibly empowering. I it's the it's the greatest thing in my life
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.080]  I am totally turning myself over to my spirit
[52:42.960 --> 52:47.200]  We call it the gut, but it's it's the great collective. It's your individual
[52:47.200 --> 52:54.320]  Connection to the great collective see global to say be a collective think what we want to no no you're an individual
[52:55.760 --> 53:00.960]  That plugs into the collective and not just currently alive people it's been proven you're
[53:01.920 --> 53:08.640]  Plugging in electrochemically to a compressed just like there is with software or music or files
[53:09.040 --> 53:14.800]  You're you're you're dialing in to compressed knowledge and what's crazy about human knowledge is
[53:14.800 --> 53:19.280]  Evil people get the first layer and then use it to control people
[53:19.280 --> 53:24.000]  They don't know that only people that are truly committed to the spirit deep dive
[53:25.360 --> 53:27.920]  And I'm not trying to get metaphysical here. I can't help it
[53:29.280 --> 53:35.280]  I am deep diving so much now into my ancestry into who I am and what I stand for and I love you so much
[53:36.000 --> 53:41.040]  I love black people so much. I love Hispanics. I love white people. We're all mongrels
[53:41.040 --> 53:44.640]  We're all from this. I just love you so much and I just I
[53:45.600 --> 53:52.640]  Just want to succeed. I it is so empowering that I don't even fear anything now except failure of our species
[53:53.280 --> 53:56.800]  I love my children more than anything and I love them so much that I have to
[53:57.680 --> 54:00.960]  I have to not let them be used as pawns in this. I have to not let the enemy
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  Use them as a threat against me. I have to
[54:04.800 --> 54:06.800]  I have to do some
[54:06.880 --> 54:08.880]  strong things
[54:08.880 --> 54:12.240]  And I'm you know, and I'm proud of it. So
[54:13.520 --> 54:15.520]  Because they don't have any future if we don't beat this
[54:16.800 --> 54:19.520]  We're all in this together. We're all going down together
[54:20.800 --> 54:22.800]  and
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.600]  It's all being manifested my god, they're in hundreds of publications a day now new york times washington post
[54:30.480 --> 54:33.760]  LA Times saying we are devil worshipers. We are going to kill you
[54:33.760 --> 54:39.840]  To everybody and they're doing that because they're scared. They've been creeping around and now they're exposed
[54:40.480 --> 54:41.920]  and
[54:41.920 --> 54:44.240]  I am just so honored to be here with you
[54:45.440 --> 54:48.480]  As impure as any of us are standing against this
[54:49.200 --> 54:51.200]  Because this is what it's all about
[54:53.120 --> 54:55.120]  And make no mistake ladies and gentlemen
[54:57.440 --> 55:00.800]  Our entire future is on the line our children are on the line and
[55:00.800 --> 55:02.400]  I
[55:02.400 --> 55:04.960]  Don't care where you come from or who you are what you do
[55:06.160 --> 55:08.320]  It isn't about left wing. It's not about right wing
[55:09.360 --> 55:12.160]  It's about humanity and it's about coming together
[55:13.040 --> 55:15.040]  And I just want you to know that
[55:17.600 --> 55:19.600]  You got to go with your spirit
[55:19.920 --> 55:21.600]  and
[55:21.600 --> 55:23.680]  We already got a break and I haven't played this clip yet
[55:24.320 --> 55:27.840]  Let's go out to break as I cut it off with a steven miller clip where he talks about
[55:27.840 --> 55:31.520]  Bannon it isn't about bannon. It's about betrayal
[55:33.280 --> 55:36.320]  And it's about now knowing who did leak everything and I even knew
[55:37.040 --> 55:40.880]  Six months ago and I chose to try to ignore it to be the big guy
[55:41.760 --> 55:43.760]  but sometimes you can't be
[55:44.400 --> 55:47.680]  It's not even pure you think you're being pure staying out of it
[55:48.240 --> 55:49.600]  Because everybody else jumps into it
[55:49.600 --> 55:56.160]  But what the real purity is gauging when you've got to be involved when you're not involved and realizing sometimes the enemy's in our camp
[55:56.160 --> 55:58.800]  Which everybody knows you're like alex. Tell us something. We don't know
[55:59.680 --> 56:01.680]  I know that
[56:03.760 --> 56:05.760]  I know that I just
[56:10.320 --> 56:12.320]  It doesn't shake me up
[56:13.120 --> 56:17.040]  Because I could take one look at steven bannon and see that he was a self-centered globalist
[56:17.440 --> 56:19.840]  hollywood takeover operation in brightmark
[56:20.080 --> 56:24.160]  They thought they could take that over from what drudge and brightmark created and lead the movement
[56:24.160 --> 56:28.800]  And trump just took it in so we could analyze what it was doing and then flush it out
[56:29.920 --> 56:31.920]  and
[56:34.560 --> 56:36.320]  Makes me sick though
[56:36.320 --> 56:38.320]  But I know that I'm going to deliver
[56:38.800 --> 56:40.800]  Just like trump's delivering on the economy
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.840]  And delivering his political correctness and delivering for the veterans and delivering with our sovereignty
[56:46.400 --> 56:50.240]  He is dynamiting at every level what they push and what they've done
[56:50.240 --> 56:55.680]  So I'm going to come back and play those clips and then we probably should open the phones up. It's just I wrote all these notes today
[56:55.680 --> 56:57.680]  I wanted to get into as well
[56:58.480 --> 57:00.480]  I'll try to get some of those but
[57:00.720 --> 57:02.720]  What hit me the strongest today
[57:03.120 --> 57:05.360]  As I was driving to work at like noon
[57:06.640 --> 57:10.640]  What hit me like a colax like a ton of bricks like a lead pipe
[57:14.960 --> 57:16.960]  Was we're right
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.920]  The globalists really are as bad as we say they are and they really are out to get us
[57:23.040 --> 57:25.040]  And they really are fallen
[57:25.200 --> 57:27.920]  There really is a devil that really is a god. We're on the planet
[57:28.560 --> 57:30.560]  And it's all up to us and it's so real
[57:31.360 --> 57:37.120]  And then the movies and the hollywood and the nfl and people posing on red carpets don't mean anything anymore
[57:37.760 --> 57:40.240]  What matters is getting yourself lined up with gods
[57:41.040 --> 57:45.600]  That's the greatest treasure you could ever imagine stay with us our number two straight ahead. Please spread the live links
[57:45.600 --> 57:47.600]  That's an active rebellion

[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.960]  Of somebody that i've seen that i've really liked that's been dead on
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.640]  And who we now know was basically helping trump write the talking points of what trump already believed
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:33.440]  Not steven bandon i mean i already knew bandon was never on the trail bandon was always slobbing around
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.960]  Let's put this photo of bandon up and i don't here's the thing i don't infight i don't attack people they stab us in the back
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.760]  And man that's bandon years ago
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.160]  I've talked to folks
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.720]  That have been around it and it just shows
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.600]  A fallen he is
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.600]  and the fact that he thinks
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.200]  He can then come apologize
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.120]  Without even apologizing five days later
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.240]  The time to do it was when it was first put out which shows you thought
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.600]  Your gamble because you were banding close to trump that that would knock him down
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.960]  And then you'd have this big trophy for your pissing contest
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.840]  I never get why these lesser men look for greater men's trophies on their walls
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.760]  If i was a great man i'd want great men that were good to live forever and great women i wouldn't want to
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.960]  See them fall because that would be an aspect of myself falling
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.600]  But you're not a king bandon
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.060]  You don't know the things of nobility
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.400]  The peasants know nobility
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:50.880]  The people know nobility the kings know nobility but the chicken, you know what sh double i you know what t
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.840]  The chicken, you know what dimension it doesn't know it. It only knows conquest
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:01.360]  And ban is an art type and a test for all of us. I don't spend time on him because he's important
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.600]  He's been obsolete for months
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.000]  It's that to learn that he
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.800]  Was the mole he was the trader confirmed and then
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:18.880]  I was all about unity and just ignoring and fighting and i'm a schmuck, but you know what admitting i'm a schmuck
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.880]  Helps me not become one again
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:29.200]  Because it's arrogant people like him that can't admit defeat and get better next time. I admit it
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.960]  I should have known i mean everything with bright bar was 100 one way
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.400]  The devil is never to make her
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.720]  The less that you give her to take her to quote rodney james dio
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.600]  and heaven and hell
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:53.680]  It's absolutely true. They can't give even though it helps them. They don't get it. They don't build worlds
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.920]  They don't build systems. They don't
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.600]  Build bright bar or help build info wars like matt rudge did. Yes, we were here. We did a lot of work
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.000]  The listeners did most of it, but there's that magic
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.120]  stardust
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:13.280]  Devils don't build they come in they take over after somebody dies. I'ma stop right there. Let's go ahead and play uh
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.720]  Stephen miller who was 15 years old doing this
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.520]  17 18 years ago. That's when you know somebody's real here it is
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.400]  President trump and the white house have been calling the russian investigation a witch hunt and a nothing burger
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.600]  But obviously in this new michael wolf book fire and fury
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.800]  Bannon offered a different take on the trump tower meeting
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.160]  Between donald trump jr. Jared cusner paul maniford and these and these other officials including a russian lawyer
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:45.280]  He called it treasonous and unpatriotic and he said that quote the chance that don jr. Did not walk these jemos up to
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.280]  His father's office on the 26th floor
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.560]  Is zero did president trump meet with any of the so-called jemos?
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.360]  Who were in that trump tower meeting?
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.040]  steve bannon's eloquence in that description notwithstanding
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.680]  It's tragic and unfortunate that steve would make these grotesque
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:12.480]  Comments so out of touch with reality and obviously so vindictive and the whole white house staff is deeply disappointed in his comments
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.800]  which were grotesque
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.880]  and with respect to the
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.280]  Trump tower meeting that he's talking about he wasn't even there when this went down
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.720]  So he's not really a remotely credible source on any of it
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:31.360]  It reads like an angry vindictive person spouting off to a highly discredible author
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.600]  The book is best understood as a work of very poorly written fiction
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.720]  And I also stay there and back this up. I want to finish this. I got a bunch of these clips from him
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:51.680]  Makes me sick that I got conned because bannon never produced nothing all trump's doing is delivering just like you the voters did
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:05:05.840]  I'm so excited the new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle two months servings filled to the brim
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:12.000]  Filled with the absolute top the real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.480]  A new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:22.480]  Because it's beyond that quite frankly. Uh, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.240]  Prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people a hundred two hundred dollars
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.800]  for the formulae
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.200]  And I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers non-gmo
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.240]  Made right here in america 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:48.240]  You add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.640]  It is amazing
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:56.480]  Red pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.480]  You
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:20.320]  They call us walking corpses waging war on corruption. It's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.320]  The
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.200]  Globalist said america western society free market was dead
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.320]  And had all the communist hells to offer us heaven
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.600]  But humanity came alive and they said no we have the submarine individual
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.240]  Joining us
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.880]  Coming up. I probably need a guess sheet. Sorry. I forgot to tell you guys that
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.040]  uh
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.960]  Who trump keeps pointing out took a photo of a 40 year old submarine
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.800]  And then somebody found it in a junk pile if you believe that and then he was sent to prison for a couple years
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.400]  Uh, we've had sauciers his name on before
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:04.320]  He's coming back on because now trump. He's going to hillary has 30 000 emails all the secret stuff. She's sharing it all
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:11.680]  Petraeus, you know gets a conviction for a couple of secret things. He took home his briefcase that his girlfriend that was probably an operative
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.160]  leaked out
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.160]  Not defending betraeus either, but man
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.040]  This is like sitting somebody in jail because they stole a dollar, but not soon as he stole a billion dollars
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.680]  Navy sailor in jail for submarine photos. Please for mercy from trump
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.720]  He wants a pardon from it. He has a criminal background now because of there's no criminal background previously
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.120]  He's joining us in the next segment, but because I
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.080]  Said I'd get to it
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:42.000]  Uh, let's go ahead here and let's go to this next clip finishing up with steven miller the white house communications director
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.920]  Getting into the grotesqueness of what uh, bannon did again. I'm not obsessing on bannon. He was already a dead letter
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.280]  We're doing it
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:57.920]  Show that people understand the anatomy of betrayal because here's the thing my greatest weakness is
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.600]  I take people at face value
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.320]  at the low level and at the
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:09.440]  Big international level and things I can endless data and like I always get it right and blah blah
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:12.800]  But then if I personally interface with somebody
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.240]  I didn't give them benefit of the doubt which is fine to do but like reagan would say trust but verify
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:27.040]  So again, let's finish up with steven miller. Here it is. It's tragic and unfortunate that steve would make these grotesque
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.760]  comments so
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.760]  Out of touch with reality and obviously so vindictive and the whole white house staff is deeply disappointed in his comments
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.840]  I'm sorry so vindictive. I mean he finally five days later says. I'm sorry
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:45.920]  I think people are great. He doesn't say the quotes are wrong because he knows it's been recorded
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:51.440]  I thought the horrible reporter of a history of you know, disinfo. It was his fault day one people were mad at me saying
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.480]  No, Trump's he's full of crap and I said, well, let's hear from bannon and then now people that said I was wrong
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.480]  You notice cnn
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.440]  Associated press Reuters bannon all of them say. Well bannon said I'm sorry
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.960]  Bannon all of them say well bannon says he should have come out earlier
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.800]  Blah blah blah, but oh cnn says bannon did it because trump attacked him at five in the afternoon
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.360]  This thing comes out at like six a.m
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.400]  So six hours five hours
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.280]  11 hours later that's a lifetime. No bannon wanted to see
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.280]  If his base went with him what he was in his base
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:32.240]  It was a pure just crazy power trip a reckless power trip
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.240]  Even if you were like a satanist
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.120]  But again these satanists even he's not a satanist in his own heart. I mean, that's what it is
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.520]  Wrecklessness power trip thinking about other things, you know
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.400]  Other than yourself only thinking about yourself
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:54.400]  That's what it is. So so again, that's the fraud that is steven bannon. Let's continue in his comments, which were grotesque
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.040]  and with respect to the
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  Trump tower meeting that he's talking about
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.760]  He wasn't even there when it just went down. So he's not oh yeah hit pause again
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:08.240]  He's not there for months. It's and then he says oh he went up to see trump
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.480]  Trump's a russian agent and then he thinks he can paper over it with
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:18.800]  Oh, I like everybody since my plan didn't work and if we let him back in it's our ball
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.920]  I'm ashamed for just not seeing it
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.400]  I apologize and feel guilty, you know, I wasn't involved just one way support and right bar
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.840]  They never linked to me. They never helped us. I don't care had a lot of good articles
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.280]  But it wasn't steven bannon. It was people like steven miller there that did that
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.160]  bannon isn't
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.400]  Bannon, let me tell you something right now
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.320]  I want the people over there at bright bar to know something whatever threats he's got
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.800]  Everything he claims he has leverage
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.240]  This guy's 110 done
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.880]  And if you don't feel the will of the people
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:00.640]  And you act like a bunch of cowards and I think it goes back to however you got control of bright bar to begin with
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:09.120]  So you all been threatened whatever it's time to man up time to do the right thing and understand here's the message
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.480]  Because I'm asking for a war with bannon
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.960]  I didn't sit there and be nice to him because oh he's god. He's steve bannon. He might say something bad about me
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.960]  I don't love it do whatever
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.720]  I did it because maybe I thought I wasn't gonna be a backbutter and wouldn't be jealous of something that was successful
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.640]  I wanted to win but now I tell you if you don't get rid of
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.760]  steven bannon, that's your choice
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.000]  I'm going to
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.680]  oppose you
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.680]  and you need to get that through your head
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.840]  And I know somebody shoots my mouth off about things but my listeners in our reach is five times bright bar
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.840]  And so you need to understand something right now that uh
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.320]  steve benedict arnold
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.560]  bannon
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.560]  deserves to be thrown
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.560]  down a political mine shaft
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.560]  and if you don't do that
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.560]  and play some
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.760]  side deal
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:08.800]  to let him still creep around as a big fricking slob
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.880]  that after we destroyed the fake russian narrative and all these victories and brought back the economy and did all this together
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.880]  he did this crappy thing
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.880]  if you don't throw him off the plank
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880]  into whatever hell he wants to live in
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.880]  then I hold you personally responsible
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.880]  and I'm giving you upfront notice right now
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.880]  that I'm not andrew bribard
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.880]  he was a great guy smart guy
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.880]  I'm not andrew bribard
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880]  you understand
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.880]  you understand right now
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.880]  you're not playing with bribard
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.880]  you're playing with the real deep state
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.880]  of america, the people
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.880]  deep state don't worry about
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.880]  worry about the real deep state
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.880]  christians, conservatives, libertarians
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.880]  good people that hate evil
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.880]  there's not some secret organization
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.880]  some code here
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.880]  this is spiritual we're connected together
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.880]  and we're ready for war
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.880]  and all you slobs think
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.880]  just because we hold back that we're weak
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.880]  you're gonna find out
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.880]  let's go to the next clip
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.880]  finish this clip and I want to go to the clip with him
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.880]  where jake tapper flips out
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.880]  and cuts the segment short here it is
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.880]  you understand
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.880]  the people who's manufacturing jobs have left
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.880]  who've been besieged by high crime communities
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.880]  and who've been affected by a policy
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.880]  of uncontrolled immigration
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.880]  those voices, those experiences
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.880]  don't get covered on this network
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.880]  to prove the point
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.880]  I was booked to talk about
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.880]  the very issues I'm just describing
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.880]  you're not even asking about them
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.880]  because they're not interesting facts to you
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.880]  you've attempted to filibuster
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.880]  by talking about your flights
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.880]  I want to ask you a question
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.880]  jake
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.880]  the president and the white house
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.880]  the president and the white house
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.880]  the reason why I want to talk about
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.880]  the president's experiences
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.880]  what I've seen with him traveling
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.880]  to meet dozens of foreign leaders
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.880]  with his incredible work
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.880]  you have 24 hours a day
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.880]  you're not gonna give
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.880]  3 minutes for the American people
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.880]  I get it
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.880]  there's one viewer that you care about
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.880]  right now and you're being obsequious
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.880]  you're being a fact told him in order to please him
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.880]  you know who I care about
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.880]  you know who I care about
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.880]  jake
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.880]  you know who I care about
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.880]  in a major reversal, Democrats are now coming to his defense
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.880]  what changed?
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.880]  let's change the subject
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.880]  so here's where I stand
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.880]  just like when I was on Pierce Morgan
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.880]  had the best ratings he ever had
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.880]  after I was on
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.880]  it broke their will
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.880]  to just say you're full of crap
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.880]  they cannot deal with it
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.880]  they say come on talk about everything you want
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.880]  once they get there they go
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.880]  oh you're not supposed to talk about this
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.880]  you're not supposed to talk about that
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.880]  you're a bad person
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.880]  when it's all a fraud
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.880]  when they're a known fake network
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.880]  we're gonna go to break and come back with our next guest
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.880]  who was put in jail for a year or so
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.880]  for taking a photo of an old submarine
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.880]  no idea but Hillary can run around
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.880]  and do something a million times worse
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.880]  literally that's coming up

[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.880]  and why this is an important book and how it ties into things
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.880]  and I just thought to myself you know this is brilliance
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.880]  this is the ultimate juxtaposition
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.880]  of what everyone says
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.880]  about the president you know
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.880]  they say that he's a racist, misogynist
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.880]  sexist bigoted homophobic Nazi
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.880]  so what better way to counter that
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.880]  than by turning him into an incredibly cute
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.880]  lovable fluffy little bunny
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.880]  it's got that fun rhyming structure to it

[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.880]  and it's a great book for adults
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.880]  great book for children we're selling the book

[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.880]  coming to you live from the front lines
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.880]  of the Infowar
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:32.880]  so back during the campaign
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.880]  President Trump today
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:36.880]  but candidate Trump then kept saying
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.880]  why does Hillary have 30 plus thousand
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.880]  illegal emails and secret servers
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.880]  and foreign deals and foundations
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.880]  and uranium and all that
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.880]  and then we've got Christian Saussier
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.880]  or Saussier of helpchrissaussier.com
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:50.880]  this navy veteran
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:52.880]  I think it's very suspicious that
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.880]  oh his camera got thrown in the landfill
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.880]  and showed a picture of a 40 year old submarine
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.880]  he was on board I mean
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.880]  I'm not a submarineer
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.880]  but I've been on tours of decommissioned
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.880]  subs both diesel
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.880]  and nuclear many years ago
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.880]  and I mean it's
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.880]  okay
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.880]  okay and this is like a joke
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.880]  so he went to jail for was a year or whatever
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.880]  he can recap the story
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.880]  and then meanwhile
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.880]  you've got this total sell-out to globalism
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:22.880]  helpchrissaussier

[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.880]  he was on Fox News, Handy last week
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.880]  he was on this months ago
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.880]  Trump has brought him back up in tweets
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.880]  let's put Trump's tweet up if we can
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.880]  before we go to Christian
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.880]  and it just
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.880]  Crooked Hillary Clinton's top aide Uma Abedine
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.880]  has been accused of
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.880]  disregarding basis treaty protocol
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.880]  classified passwords in the hands of foreign agents
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.880]  you put those in there
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.880]  remember sailors pictures of a submarine
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.880]  jail, deep state justice
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.880]  department must act also on Comey
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.880]  and others, Comey admittedly
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.880]  now the head of the
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.880]  judiciary committee
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.880]  has come out
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.880]  and said it's clearly illegal
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.880]  a Chuck Grassley so this is a big deal
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.880]  ladies and gentlemen and our guest
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.880]  takes credit
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:12.880]  and says okay put me in jail for a year
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.880]  really to do anything
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.880]  he just has just punished them
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.880]  so Christian, Saussier thank you for joining us
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.880]  back on Alex
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.880]  so we only got like
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.880]  eight, nine minutes you got the floor
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.880]  tell folks what's happened and the president's
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.880]  back talking about you in the news
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.880]  and in tweets what do you make of this
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.880]  well I make of it that the president
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.880]  is very correctly calling out
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.880]  a clearly corrupt
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.880]  upper, you know, echelon of the FBI
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.880]  and the DOJ under the Obama administration
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.880]  to include Andrew McCabe taking
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.880]  financial donations for his wife's
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.880]  campaign and
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.880]  leaking James Comey, leaking
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.880]  classified information to the press while punishing
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.880]  people like me for doing far less
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.880]  you know these are the
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.880]  guys that ran the investigation that destroyed
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.880]  my life for a few pictures that I took because I was
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.880]  proud of where I worked and I wanted to be able to
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.880]  remember it and by the way everybody in the
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.880]  military does that
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.880]  you know and then let the Hillary Clinton
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.880]  campaign and all of her cronies get a pass
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.880]  for doing
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.880]  a million times worse
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.880]  the pictures I took were
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.880]  by the way you're not exaggerating
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.880]  we're talking just I mean
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.880]  it's not even comparable
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.880]  no and it's clear
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.880]  I think now to the American people that
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.880]  these humabidine emails come out where she
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.880]  gave them access to a pedophile
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.880]  that there was clearly some
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.880]  cover up within the FBI and the DOJ
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.880]  at the very same time that they were
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.880]  prosecuting me for the
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.880]  most of infractions which is usually
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.880]  you forget you didn't mention my problem
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.880]  is to mention it takes hours
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.880]  you've got like 20 something of the 26
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.880]  people already resigned or gone or retired
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:48.880]  you've got org or whatever his name is
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.880]  giving 2 million to his wife heading up
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.880]  the fusing GPS fake
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.880]  he's giving his wife 2
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.880]  million I mean that right I mean this
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.880]  is and it's all made up
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.880]  it's a criminal
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:02.880]  you know headed by the Obama
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.880]  administration and Loretta Lynch is right
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.880]  on board meeting on an airplane tarmac
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.880]  with a target of an investigation
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.880]  spouse and that reeks of all
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.880]  kinds of misconduct but the
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.880]  American people are just now seeing it
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.880]  because we have a president who's not afraid
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.880]  to call out the people that are doing
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.880]  illegal acts that are at the top of the
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.880]  echelon you know the elites he's not afraid
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.880]  to call out Hillary Clinton and say
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:26.880]  what the heck is going on there even in the news
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.880]  calling him mentally ill saying
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.880]  he doesn't do politics or inside deals
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.880]  he only cares about the people
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.880]  who see it
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.880]  well because he's calling out the people
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.880]  that run this country in the dark
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.880]  rooms you know behind the in the dark
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.880]  alleys and he's not afraid to
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.880]  because he's a president for the people
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.880]  and so the first way to discredit him
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:48.880]  is to try to call him mentally unstable
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.880]  which is anything but true
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.880]  I agree shouldn't he just like he's getting ready
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.880]  with a son he's already done it judicially
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.880]  pardon you just to
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.880]  expose something they attack him he can
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.880]  even more point out what Hillary did
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.880]  well absolutely I mean I think he would send
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.880]  a very clear example if you pardon me
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.880]  don't get me wrong you know my life's been destroyed
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.880]  pardoning me would definitely help me
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.880]  restore my good name but I think more importantly
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.880]  it would send a message to the American people
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880]  and to the people who serve in the military
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.880]  I served 11 years honorably I'm proud of my service
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.880]  I wasn't a traitor like Bo Bergdahl
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.880]  Bradley Manning I
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.880]  served my country I did two deployments in the
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.880]  Middle East I never left anybody behind
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.880]  and I would go back and do it again
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.880]  I would gladly give my life for this country
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.880]  I don't buy that they found the camera in a landfill
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.880]  it sounds like you were the victim of
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.880]  an intelligence operation
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.880]  my ex-wife turned over the camera
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.880]  because she was
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.880]  ticked off at me and
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:41.880]  she knew I had the
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.880]  and then she just said it was in a landfill
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.880]  well her friend that worked at the landfill
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:47.880]  said he discovered it
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.880]  so yeah but
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.880]  yeah so I mean what more important though is
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.880]  is just the fact that
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.880]  you know these people are allowed to get away with
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.880]  the far more serious offense
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.880]  when if anything my case should have served as an example
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.880]  of why they should have been prosecuted
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.880]  if they're willing to go after me for low level class
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:05.880]  or portray us but
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.880]  yeah I went to prison for a year
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.880]  my life was destroyed all the skills
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.880]  that I learned in the Navy and then I served 11 years
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.880]  doing operating nuclear power plants
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.880]  right now I work as a trash collector
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.880]  that was the only job I could get don't get me wrong
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.880]  I'm proud to be working and contributing
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.880]  to society because I'm not going to be a
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.880]  deadbeat living off welfare but
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.880]  I you know it's upsetting that
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.880]  when I go to apply to employers then they know
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.880]  maybe we should hire you as a reporter
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.880]  because I'm about to launch a bunch of new shows
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.880]  we decided to do it even though we're under attack
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.880]  and every let's talk this week
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.880]  we got about a minute and a half left
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.880]  what do you make of record
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.880]  unemployment employment for blacks
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.880]  record economy coming back
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.880]  and they're saying Trump is Armageddon
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.880]  he would destroy the economy and the left won't
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:49.880]  give him any credit for it
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.880]  I think they just won't admit it I mean they don't want to admit
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.880]  that they've been wrong all this time CNN
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.880]  all the liberal news networks
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.880]  just don't want to admit that they were wrong
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.880]  they haven't recovered my story at all because
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.880]  they don't want to because it proves that there's a double standard
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.880]  of justice in that they're you know
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.880]  it's all sick of fancy this Hillary Clinton is
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.880]  perfectly exactly I don't like
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.880]  betray us for his globalism but he's not all bad
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.880]  but he took home some files
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.880]  and some operative woman
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.880]  set him up for that a general
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.880]  can't take files home I mean this is
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.880]  ridiculous but I'll tell you what
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.880]  the sick part about the Obama administration is
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.880]  they were more than willing to use somebody like
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.880]  me who honorably served in the military
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.880]  as an example
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.880]  you know and and throw us under the bus
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.880]  and use us for political gain I mean
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.880]  even Bo Bergdahl he used for political gain I mean he called
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.880]  him a hero when he knew he was a traitor
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.880]  just so he could get people released from Guantanamo
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.880]  so you know I think
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.880]  President Trump by pardoning me would send
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.880]  a very clear message to the people of the military
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.880]  constantly put their lives on the line defending freedom
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:49.880]  and I agree that was my final question that he'll stand by him
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.880]  what do you think about the word that he may
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.880]  pardon Assange and is already
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.880]  into the grand jury and things
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.880]  well I think Julian Assange for all
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:59.880]  that there you know the complaints
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.880]  that people have again he's putting the truth out there
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.880]  he was not afraid to put out
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.880]  the truth about Hillary Clinton
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:07.880]  Hillary Clinton plays herself office as liberal
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.880]  but she's one of the worst people in this country
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.880]  she has sold our country out
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.880]  on numerous occasions and Julian Assange
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.880]  was afraid to put that out so that the world could see
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.880]  and I think that
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.880]  to some extent that's what we need
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.880]  we need people like Trump and Assange who are willing
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.880]  to speak the truth regardless of the blowback
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.880]  that they're going to receive because that's

[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.880]  of preservation
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.880]  like canning or dehydrating

[01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.880]  there is no comparison
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.880]  harvest right freeze dryers
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.880]  retain 97% of the food's
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.880]  taste, color and nutritional value

[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.880]  or in weeks, months and years
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.880]  previous
[01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.880]  what we see the globalists really doing
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:33.880]  is not just assaulting the truth
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.880]  itself but attacking the very
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.880]  underpinning
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.880]  of genetic creation
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.880]  on this planet
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.880]  trying to break down the way plants
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.880]  reproduce
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.880]  the way animals reproduce
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.880]  the way reptiles reproduce
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:51.880]  attempting to really
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:53.880]  take control of the system
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.880]  and
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.880]  capture creation within a synthetic
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.880]  terminator gene
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.880]  program
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:03.880]  that is the advanced
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.880]  but wicked intelligence
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.880]  that we Christians call the devil
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.880]  that others just call plain evil
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:11.880]  that is animating
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.880]  and manipulating the servants of this system
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.880]  and the servants of this system are
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.880]  not even really
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.880]  getting any true power
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.880]  out of what they do
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:23.880]  they get some temporal power
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.880]  but it's completely empty
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.880]  within the current power structure
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.880]  it is a dehumanizing power
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:31.880]  any
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.880]  worldly power they get
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.880]  they lose at the expense of their soul
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.880]  of their spirit
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.880]  so
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.880]  I've been trying to figure out why I get so mad
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:43.880]  when the globalists lie about Donald Trump
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:45.880]  or put out their talking points or misrepresent
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.880]  and it's because
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.880]  I realize it's a fundamental attack
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.880]  on the truth
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.880]  not that Donald Trump is truth
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.880]  or that I'm perfect truth
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:57.880]  but that we are worshiping the truth
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:59.880]  which is God
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.880]  that we are trying to be good and honorable
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.880]  and strong and we believe in a civilization
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:05.880]  and a world
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.880]  that will be good for our children, grandchildren
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.880]  great grandchildren
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:11.880]  times a thousand generations to live in
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.880]  we're not out
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:15.880]  to totally control and dominate
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:17.880]  the public
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.880]  and turn them into our slaves
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.880]  and so
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:23.880]  it is the very human condition
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:25.880]  and the very social compact
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.880]  that is under attack by the globalists
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.880]  they are consciously
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.880]  adherents to corruption
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:35.880]  because to give into evil
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:37.880]  to give into manipulation
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.880]  to give into cheating
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.880]  well you gotta give into it completely
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:43.880]  there's no half measures
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.880]  with evil
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.880]  it always gets worse or it gets better
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.880]  there is no equilibrium
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:51.880]  or great balance that we're always
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.880]  hearing about from the Luciferians
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:55.880]  the truth is
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.880]  the only balance is the struggle
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:59.880]  between good and evil
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.880]  but you're either
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:03.880]  pulling towards good
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.880]  or you're pulling towards evil
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.880]  and they have consciously
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:09.880]  decided
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.880]  that humanity is crap
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:13.880]  that their own children are garbage
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.880]  and that they want to write a hate letter
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.880]  to humanity
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:19.880]  but if you just study history
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.880]  or common sense
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.880]  2 plus 2 equals 4
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.880]  or how do you judge
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.880]  an apple tree
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.880]  well does it grow juicy sweet
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.880]  plentiful apples
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.880]  how do you judge a plum tree
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.880]  how do you judge
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.880]  a line of potato seeds
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.880]  are they big do they grow in drought ridden
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.880]  weather are they tasty
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.880]  are they pest resistant
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.880]  do they last a long time after you dug them out of the ground
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.880]  how do you judge a spring
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.880]  is it clear is it pure
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.880]  does it taste good is it healthy
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.880]  how do you judge a liar
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.880]  do they betray you do they lie to you
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.880]  over and over again
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.880]  it's the same thing and as I covered earlier
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.880]  we should probably put this up
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.880]  on screen behind me if we can
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.880]  info wars.com has the article
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.880]  even NBC news was forced to cover it
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:11.880]  but zero hedge is an excellent breakdown of it
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.880]  another false narrative
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.880]  black unemployment at record
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:17.880]  lows and there's a graph
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:19.880]  that in the history
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:21.880]  since they've been recording
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.880]  black unemployment
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.880]  it is the lowest it has ever been
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:29.880]  and wages even
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:31.880]  adjusted for inflation
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.880]  are the highest for African Americans
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:35.880]  in just
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.880]  one year
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:39.880]  we're 11 months
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.880]  and what 15 days
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.880]  or something
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.880]  20 days coming up on the 20th
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.880]  is the one year anniversary we're less than a year
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.880]  in and we already have
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.880]  the best
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:53.880]  black employment numbers
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.880]  we've ever had we've got the best
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:57.880]  general numbers since 1984
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.880]  we've got a 25,000
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.880]  stock market we've got 2,000 plus companies
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.880]  announcing they're coming back
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.880]  I've seen the media
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.880]  go oh look
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:09.880]  Donald Trump in the White House
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:11.880]  copy Alex Jones' talking points
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:13.880]  which really 99% of the time
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.880]  it's not true though I'd love to flatter
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:17.880]  myself and say that
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.880]  but when I see White House
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:23.880]  talking points a lot of times the same time
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:25.880]  I put them out or a day early or a day after
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.880]  it varies
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.880]  why is it so similar to what I say
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:31.880]  and vice versa
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.880]  not because we're talking
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.880]  or conferring or lining it up
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:37.880]  but because we're looking
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.880]  at the facts
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.880]  we're looking at the reality
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.880]  so see we don't have to get together
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.880]  in some smoky room and come up with what the
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.880]  talking point is because the truth
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.880]  doesn't have talking points
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.880]  you can
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.880]  put the truth together and look at what's happened
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.880]  and have those talking points but the truth doesn't
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.880]  need to line up a teleprompter
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.880]  message
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.880]  the truth is based in the fruit
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.880]  you may have a big
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.880]  old bushy pretty plum tree
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.880]  I remember my grandma had a bunch of plum trees
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:11.880]  going out in front of her house and apple trees you name it
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.880]  and I remember her looking out saying that's a big old
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.880]  pretty plum tree
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:17.880]  but it's bigger than all the others don't you see some
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:19.880]  and I was like 8 years old staying there one summer
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.880]  and I said yes
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.880]  to Patty Jones
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.880]  and she said I'm going to have them
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.880]  cut that down
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.880]  she said you know it's a pretty tree son it's not
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.880]  producing any plums
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.880]  but she said you see those little smaller trees
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.880]  they're full of plums see that one
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.880]  that's hanging down to the ground with plums
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:41.880]  that can turn into plum jelly
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.880]  and give to our friends and family and we can eat
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.880]  and she was giving me a parable
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:47.880]  right then I didn't realize how smart she was
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:49.880]  always educating always giving me heart
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.880]  types always showing me
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:53.880]  but now we don't hang out
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:55.880]  with our grandmothers on the front porch
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.880]  for 3-4 hours drinking lemonade
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:59.880]  eating cookies
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:01.880]  no we play
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:03.880]  Xbox and we watch the NFL
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.880]  and I'm not saying that's pure evil
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.880]  it just distracts us from our real humanity
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:09.880]  and so you judge
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.880]  a tree
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.880]  by its fruits
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:17.880]  and by every
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.880]  yardstick not the rhetoric not the talk
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.880]  but what's been deployed
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:23.880]  Trump has delivered
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.880]  you know they come out as we predicted
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:27.880]  as we didn't predict as we were told by sources
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:29.880]  as we broke keep saying predicted as we broke
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.880]  back in April
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:33.880]  back in March back in May
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.880]  you play those clips many times when you play them here again with our sources
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:37.880]  Roger Stone and others that they would then say
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:39.880]  he has Alzheimer's he's mentally ill
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:41.880]  wow how bad was the previous
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.880]  controllers if you believe
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:45.880]  their story he has Alzheimer's which obviously isn't true
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:47.880]  and
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.880]  we've got
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:51.880]  the best unemployment numbers ever
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.880]  the best for blacks the best for whites
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.880]  the best for Hispanics we've got the best
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.880]  new jobs numbers the best small business numbers
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.880]  the best stock market ever
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.880]  and optimism coming back
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:03.880]  in
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.880]  because he simply removed the boot from our neck
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.880]  at least partially his job was pretty easy
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.880]  if he could get into the presidency
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.880]  and not be killed because the globalists were
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.880]  artificially
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.880]  doing this and then he said
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.880]  you know
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:19.880]  I've been huge in real
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.880]  state and successful and I've been number one
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.880]  on TV and then out of nowhere never running
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.880]  for office which nobody does just
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:27.880]  never ran for office then you first time
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.880]  you win the presidency against all odds
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:31.880]  I'd say that's pretty genius
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:33.880]  and you know Trump wasn't
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.880]  bragging there
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.880]  it was genius
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.880]  and you were genius going up against
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.880]  the globalist and mainstream media and them demonizing
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.880]  that you and them trying to demoralize you
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:45.880]  and them attacking you
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.880]  you had the innate
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.880]  spiritual genius of the sermon to not
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.880]  go with the crowd in the line but to
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.880]  head down do what's right and then
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:55.880]  see the real
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.880]  evidence of goodness
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:59.880]  which is delivering
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.880]  on your promises and prosperity
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.880]  and standing up for the innocence
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.880]  and standing up for Christianity
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.880]  and standing against the bullies
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.880]  and the thugs and the controllers
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.880]  and
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.880]  that said what Trump has done
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.880]  is beyond genius it is
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.880]  honor it is strength it is
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.880]  will it is
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.880]  it is divine providence
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:23.880]  just like George Washington witnessed and we are
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.880]  seeing 245 years
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:27.880]  after the founding of our nation
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.880]  the oxygen coming back into the room
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:31.880]  and here's the key when I come back
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.880]  it's a test if we
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.880]  reject this God always gives you a test
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:37.880]  especially a nation like America he loves
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.880]  if we reject this
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.880]  the hatch will be lowered and the real evil
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:43.880]  will be let in this is our final chance
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.880]  right back
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.880]  defending the republic from enemies
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:51.880]  foreign and domestic
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:43:09.880]  music
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:13.800]  help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.280]  in the gut.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:17.440]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.640]  Cardivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:24.840]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:29.400]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.160]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.400]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:40.360]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:44.720]  Cardivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:47.400]  you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:48.760]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.440]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of b-vitamins we need
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:12.440]  every day.
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.080]  U-up, u-up, u-up, optimum levels.
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:15.920]  B-vitamins we need every day.

[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:23.920]  U-up, u-up, u-up, optimal absorption.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:29.640]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:32.400]  Secret 12 – Optimal Absorption
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:37.560]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:44.960]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.

[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.240]  probiotic.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:11.960]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:19.640]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:24.600]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over

[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:28.640]  There are many secrets in this world, but all of them are basically prima facie, they're
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:31.760]  there on its face.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:36.000]  But the master does not appear until the student is ready.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.200]  That's an old Zen saying and it's absolutely true.
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:44.720]  Trump, and I could instinctually but also in a Machiavellian way see this three years
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:51.280]  ago when this all started, saw the global wave against the globalist and he knew that
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:48:00.080]  when he bound himself to this that his entire destiny and everything he had been was and
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:12.480]  would be and his very family name would be inexorably tied in a good way the way metaphysically
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:21.680]  in the archetype of J.R. Tolton's Lord of the Rings, Soran's soul was tied to the ring.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:28.400]  And so with Trump in a good way delivering and producing good fruit and doing what he
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:38.120]  said he would do and being in your corner is what sets up his family for an incredible
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:42.800]  unparalleled historical dynasty with power.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:48.800]  Things tend to get corrupt with absolute power, corrupts absolutely the core word acting.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:54.240]  But I spiritually at a sermon level do not pick up evil from Trump.
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.920]  Is the dynasty the best thing in the world?
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:58.040]  Probably not.
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:05.960]  But the point is, is that Trump's already been everywhere, he's already seen it all
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:12.280]  and you see the response by true evil that is real and that tells you Trump's for real.
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:19.840]  But then you see what he's claimed he would do being delivered, the tax cuts, securing
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:24.240]  the borders, the sovereignty, taking care of the veterans, boosting the market, bringing
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.040]  jobs back, standing up against the communist Chinese that are oppressing their own people
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.040]  and bringing our jobs back.
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:33.440]  Oh no, no, no, I'm not going to list it all.
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.680]  The globalists didn't build all this, just reverse it at the end.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.920]  They didn't just construct all this to then have it all turned on its head.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.680]  And that's why they're fighting for their lives.
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:52.440]  So the big secret of Trump is in the collective will, in the collective zeitgeist, in the
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:50:03.000]  collective unconscious, in the internet of the mind, in the sixth sense, Trump is us.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:12.280]  And he's channeling the will of the people to have a strong male leader that the globalist
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.880]  fear stand against them.
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:21.080]  So he is a reflection and a shadow and an echo of the will of those that came before
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:23.800]  us to empower the species.
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:30.920]  Trump is a manifestation of the life force coming out of a long stage of hibernation,
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:35.040]  the life force coming out of a coma and being manifest again.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:41.400]  And that's why, despite all the attacks and all the demonization and all the talking points
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:46.800]  and all the dirty tricks, everything they do turns against them because Trump has turned
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:54.400]  himself over to destiny and not some evil destiny to burn down the world, but the destiny
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:01.280]  of building a better world and committing honorably to that path.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.960]  That's when God gets involved.
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:07.320]  When you line yourself up in the right time in history with other people that are lined
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:12.400]  up as well as the planets align culturally, spiritually, metaphysically.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.280]  I don't mean literally.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:20.000]  As that season enters, humanity then has that great choice of where they want to go in the
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  future.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.880]  So that's why the enemy hates him so much.
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:30.400]  And I happened along a AOL compilation video today this morning when I was doing research.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:35.480]  And I watched like 30 minutes of video after video of just the Sunday and Saturday news
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:42.160]  shows, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, and it was all the same talking point.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:43.160]  Bannon's in trouble.
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:48.920]  Everything we disagree with him because Trump doesn't stand for anything.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:52.920]  And so Bannon does not deal with somebody that's such a psychopath and so fake.
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:57.040]  And this is Al Sharpton telling us this, and then we go to the next clip and the next clip
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:01.640]  and the next clip of Michael Wolf, the known fraud, and the next fraud, the next fraud,
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:02.920]  the next fraud.
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:09.760]  But there was the proof of the fraud that they're all telling me he's not real.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:15.680]  But then everything I see is real and happening to their heart and against their plan and
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:21.960]  all over the world, men and women are standing up against globalism and saying no and bringing
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:25.920]  back sovereignty and bringing back the family and bringing back what Hollywood and this
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:30.720]  whole satanic poisonous system that wants to stun us to control us before it takes us
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:31.720]  over.
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:37.000]  So there are really five pillars to this whole thing.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:45.000]  And most important is spirit and then his shelter and food and medicine.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:54.480]  Those are all real, those five, but what are the frauds, status, where you are in the perch
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:00.520]  and magic, imaginary thinking, delusions, imagining you're something you're not because
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:04.240]  you have God's seed in you, you have the ultimate potential.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:09.080]  But that doesn't mean you have gone through the stages that this species has to go through
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:13.240]  just because you can imagine the mind of God, just because you can commune with the mind
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:20.480]  of God, just because you can interface with that, does not mean you are that.
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:27.840]  With great wisdom comes great sorrow and then you learn the wicked sleigh with none pursue
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:37.520]  and then you understand that these people want power, but they don't want responsibility.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:47.880]  They want the castles and the red carpets and the red carpets were paid in the blood
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.320]  of those countries that conquered.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.920]  We don't walk on red carpets.
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:54:05.240]  We walk on the gates to the heavens indescribably beautiful, deepest blue with stars and planets
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:11.280]  and the firmament, we are walking on the blue carpet of life with our soul interfacing
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:19.760]  with God and all the time before us and all the time to flow out from this moment and
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:29.340]  the attempt of some people who weren't Satanist, who weren't pedophiles, some people who really
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:34.200]  believe in humanity, who'd already been at the tops of power and maybe even delved into
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:42.440]  the darkness as I have done and pulled back and said, I want Christ, who done the parasitic
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:49.360]  things, the casinos and the structure and found that there's nothing there on earth.
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:54.440]  There is only God in our connection to God and that's the big secret they do everything
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:55:01.280]  to take your food, your shelter, your medication, your spirit, your defense to make you the opposite
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:06.840]  of independent dependent and that's the big secret and you see Trump under attack, gone
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:15.760]  through the fire, stronger than ever, standing there at Camp David laying out the truth and
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:22.160]  saying it is genius what we did together to come from nowhere against the entire global
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.320]  estates and win the presidency and then get the tax cuts and everything they didn't want
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:30.120]  the prosperity because they want to make us dependent to break their back in less than
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:31.120]  one year.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:37.080]  If that isn't genius, nothing is, but bigger than genius, it was destiny, it was Providence
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:38.080]  and it was courage.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:39.080]  Here's the president.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:43.200]  You're talking about the policy issues that you all were focusing on last few days here
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:46.800]  at Camp David, but this morning you were tweeting about your mental state.
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.080]  Why did you feel the need to tweet about that this morning?
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:54.040]  Well, only because I went to the best colleges or college.
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:59.320]  I went to a, I had a situation where I was a very excellent student, came out, made billions
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:04.280]  and billions of dollars, became one of the top business people, went to television and
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:10.560]  for 10 years was a tremendous success, as you probably have heard, ran for president
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:12.440]  one time and won.
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.200]  And then I hear this guy that does it not know me, doesn't know me at all, by the way
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:21.080]  did not interview me for three, he said he interviewed me for three hours in the White
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:22.080]  House.
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:23.080]  It didn't exist.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.080]  Okay.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.080]  It's in his imagination.
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:29.960]  And what I was heartened by because I talk about fake news and the fake news media was
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:36.200]  I really was the fact that so many of the people that I talk about in terms of fake
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:43.320]  news actually came to the defense of this great administration and even myself because
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:46.480]  they know the author and they know he's a fraud.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:50.600]  And when I saw some of the people say, and you look at some of his past books, he did
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:55.480]  a book on Rupert Murdoch, it was a terrible expose and it was false.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:57.040]  So much of it was false.
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:00.040]  I consider it a work of fiction.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:05.320]  And I think it's a disgrace that somebody's able to have something, do something like
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:06.320]  that.
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:07.520]  The libel laws are very weak in this country.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:11.080]  If they were strong, it would be very helpful.
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:15.320]  You wouldn't have things like that happen where you can say whatever comes to your head.
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:18.200]  But just so you know, I never interviewed with him in the White House at all.
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:20.000]  He was never in the Oval Office.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.760]  We didn't have an interview.
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:28.320]  And I did a quick interview with him a long time ago having to do with an article.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:29.320]  But I don't know this man.
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:33.680]  I guess sloppy Steve brought him into the White House quite a bit and it was one of
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:34.680]  those things.
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.720]  That's why sloppy Steve is now looking for a job.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:37.720]  Okay.
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:38.720]  Who else you have?
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:39.720]  Yes.
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:45.280]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:51.200]  This is Alex Jones introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.760]  by Infowars Life.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:57.880]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:02.080]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:06.200]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:09.640]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:14.000]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  your wallet.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.640]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.200]  immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:26.280]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:30.840]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:35.560]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:38.920]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:43.160]  Head to InfowarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:48.280]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
