[00:00.000 --> 00:22.880]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, Owen Schroder sitting in for Alex just momentarily as he
[00:22.880 --> 00:25.400]  will be joining us once he finishes up a special project.
[00:25.400 --> 00:28.520]  We got great guest Gavin McGinnis joining us, Mark Dice joining us.
[00:28.520 --> 00:32.800]  I want to talk to you guys and Alex about a video we had taken down from YouTube.
[00:32.800 --> 00:37.040]  We've got new discoveries regarding fake news about human evolution.
[00:37.040 --> 00:38.160]  We'll get to that as well.
[00:38.160 --> 00:42.240]  But first, a report from John Bowne talking about the healthcare reform bill that is heading
[00:42.240 --> 00:43.240]  to the Senate.
[00:43.240 --> 00:48.000]  I think that the Republicans, including Trump, have celebrated just a little bit too early
[00:48.000 --> 00:49.000]  on this one.
[00:49.000 --> 00:50.880]  Here's the report from John Bowne.
[00:50.880 --> 00:55.600]  Trickle-down crowd is now having a beer party in the Rose Garden.
[00:55.600 --> 01:00.440]  The Trump administration plan to overhaul the Obamacare nightmare is headed to a Senate
[01:00.440 --> 01:03.040]  that is drafting its own version of the bill.
[01:03.040 --> 01:08.080]  And thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, welcome to the beginning of the
[01:08.080 --> 01:10.080]  end of Obamacare.
[01:10.080 --> 01:17.560]  As we suffered with Obamacare, I went through two years of campaigning and I'm telling
[01:17.560 --> 01:25.400]  you no matter where I went, people were suffering so badly with the ravages of Obamacare.
[01:25.400 --> 01:30.120]  And I will say this, that as far as I'm concerned, your premiums, they're going to start to
[01:30.120 --> 01:31.520]  come down.
[01:31.520 --> 01:33.800]  We're going to get this passed through the Senate.
[01:33.800 --> 01:36.040]  I feel so confident.
[01:36.040 --> 01:41.560]  Your deductibles, when it comes to deductibles, they were so ridiculous that nobody got to
[01:41.560 --> 01:47.520]  use their current plan, this non-existent plan that I heard so many wonderful things
[01:47.520 --> 01:50.440]  about over the last three or four days after that.
[01:50.440 --> 01:53.440]  I mean, I don't think you're going to hear so much right now.
[01:53.440 --> 01:58.560]  The insurance companies are fleeing, it's been a catastrophe, and this is a great plan.
[01:58.560 --> 02:02.640]  I actually think it will get even better, and this is make no mistake.
[02:02.640 --> 02:09.120]  This is a repeal and a replace of Obamacare, make no mistake about it.
[02:09.120 --> 02:15.320]  Today we're passing a bill out of fairness and transparency to ensure that Congress operates
[02:15.320 --> 02:21.360]  under the same laws as private citizens.
[02:21.360 --> 02:25.080]  A principle that both Republicans and Democrats should support.
[02:25.080 --> 02:29.760]  Do not buy into this hoax, there's no money left, they want to go back to the old system
[02:29.760 --> 02:31.960]  and the old system stunk.
[02:31.960 --> 02:37.000]  It's not, what we did was correct the problems of the old system, so don't believe this cruel
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  hoax.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.040]  John Kerry said, no, no, no, we're going to tax your health insurance, we're going to
[02:41.040 --> 02:44.720]  tax those evil insurance companies, we're going to impose a tax that if they say health
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.960]  insurance is too expensive, we're going to tax them, and conveniently the tax rate will
[02:47.960 --> 02:51.280]  happen to be the marginal tax rate under the income tax code.
[02:51.280 --> 02:55.000]  So basically it's the same thing, we just tax the insurance companies, they pass it
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.040]  on higher prices, that offsets the tax break we get, it ends up being the same thing.
[02:59.040 --> 03:04.080]  So a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the
[03:04.080 --> 03:05.200]  American voter.
[03:05.200 --> 03:09.640]  Any moderate in the crowd who voted for this bill turned radical today.
[03:09.640 --> 03:15.560]  In order to avoid a Democratic filibuster, special budget rules under the guise of reconciliation
[03:15.560 --> 03:20.920]  are in effect requiring only 51 votes rather than the standard 60 votes.
[03:20.920 --> 03:26.560]  Republican senators are already approaching the bill with kid gloves, among their concerns
[03:26.560 --> 03:32.400]  include the proposal to allow states to define the regulations requiring insurers to cover
[03:32.400 --> 03:38.720]  certain services, a 30 percent surcharge for lapsed insurance plans, and the increase in
[03:38.720 --> 03:43.200]  charging older adults five times the amount that of young adults.
[03:43.200 --> 03:48.240]  House Freedom Caucus made the bill a lot less bad, but what I'm still concerned with is
[03:48.240 --> 03:53.240]  this will be the first time that Republicans have affirmatively put their stamp of approval
[03:53.240 --> 03:58.240]  on a program where federal money, taxpayer money, is paid to insurance companies.
[03:58.240 --> 04:02.920]  And I really frankly am not too excited about, you know, subsidizing the profit of insurance
[04:02.920 --> 04:03.920]  companies.
[04:03.920 --> 04:05.440]  They make a great deal of profit.
[04:05.440 --> 04:10.600]  Their profits went from 6 billion a year to 15 billion a year under Obamacare, and now
[04:10.600 --> 04:14.960]  they want to quadrant off the individual market where they don't make money and say, oh, we
[04:14.960 --> 04:18.920]  want everybody to have insurance, we're so magnanimous, but as long as the taxpayer pays
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.640]  for it, and premiums will come down as long as you subsidize the people that get sick,
[04:23.640 --> 04:27.960]  which is what's supposed to be what the insurance is about when you get in sick, that's when
[04:27.960 --> 04:29.840]  the insurance company is supposed to pay.
[04:29.840 --> 04:31.120]  They don't want to pay when you get sick.
[04:31.120 --> 04:35.560]  They just want to reap the profit and then stick the taxpayer with the rest of the bill.
[04:35.560 --> 04:40.240]  So there's about three or four hundred billion dollars in this bill for insurance company
[04:40.240 --> 04:45.640]  profit, and it boggles my mind how that became a Republican idea.
[04:45.640 --> 04:50.680]  Is putting a Band-Aid on Obamacare really the best way forward, or should we just go
[04:50.680 --> 04:55.120]  back to the way it was before the unaffordable Health Care Act?
[04:55.120 --> 05:00.200]  John Bown for Infowars.com.
[05:00.200 --> 05:04.720]  While the Trump effect on relationships, according to the Washington Examiner, is causing breakups,
[05:04.720 --> 05:10.280]  the Trump effect on the Democrats and liberals is surely mad, as if the 178-year-old millennial
[05:10.280 --> 05:12.480]  Maxine Waters wasn't getting enough attention.
[05:12.480 --> 05:16.920]  The James Brown wig wearing a corpse took to the stage of the MTV Movie Awards to a roaring
[05:16.920 --> 05:17.920]  ovation.
[05:17.920 --> 05:21.440]  The wig won the award for Best Fight Against the System, another side Trump effect on the
[05:21.440 --> 05:23.160]  left, giving themselves awards.
[05:23.160 --> 05:26.040]  Check Chelsea Clinton, Barack Obama, now a James Brown wig.
[05:26.040 --> 05:31.040]  The classy Democrat Senator Kamala Harris, also from California, decided to drop an F-bomb
[05:31.040 --> 05:33.920]  while speaking about health care during a public event.
[05:33.920 --> 05:37.520]  Speaking to the young turds for more than 60 seconds, and you're likely to hear a belligerent
[05:37.520 --> 05:39.200]  rant involving many curses.
[05:39.200 --> 05:43.000]  But now the Hill has published a story, The 43 People Who Might Run Against Trump, which
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.240]  includes the worst of the Democrat Party, and then Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne The Rock
[05:47.240 --> 05:48.240]  Johnson.
[05:48.240 --> 05:52.120]  At this point, President Trump has turned the political left into an absolute circus
[05:52.120 --> 05:53.760]  act fit of berserking.
[05:53.760 --> 06:00.440]  I'm Owen Shroyer, and for Infowars.com, the Trump effect has been huge.
[06:00.440 --> 06:05.400]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[06:05.400 --> 06:08.760]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[06:08.760 --> 06:13.960]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with
[06:13.960 --> 06:20.160]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.560]  great tasting formula.
[06:21.560 --> 06:25.960]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that
[06:25.960 --> 06:30.160]  are our superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[06:30.160 --> 06:34.520]  Only one knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[06:34.520 --> 06:39.840]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full
[06:39.840 --> 06:43.760]  of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[06:43.760 --> 06:46.320]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[06:46.320 --> 06:50.680]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[06:50.680 --> 06:54.280]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[06:54.280 --> 06:57.800]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[06:57.800 --> 07:00.320]  at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[07:00.320 --> 07:03.400]  A new shipment of bio-truth selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:03.400 --> 07:05.280]  We've been sold out for months.
[07:05.280 --> 07:10.400]  Our one of a kind InfoWarsLife bio-truth selenium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:10.400 --> 07:14.280]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its
[07:14.280 --> 07:15.280]  core.
[07:15.280 --> 07:19.040]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium,
[07:19.040 --> 07:24.160]  but bio-truth selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[07:24.160 --> 07:27.720]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[07:27.720 --> 07:32.220]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, bio-truth
[07:32.220 --> 07:37.200]  selenium is also the perfect supercharger to survive shield X2 nascent iodine, as both
[07:37.200 --> 07:39.800]  help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[07:39.800 --> 07:44.800]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of bio-truth selenium before we sell it again.
[07:44.800 --> 07:49.120]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help
[07:49.120 --> 07:53.880]  yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360Win.
[07:53.880 --> 07:55.880]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[07:55.880 --> 07:56.880]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[07:56.880 --> 07:57.880]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:57.880 --> 08:09.880]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[08:09.880 --> 08:14.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[08:14.600 --> 08:18.320]  And now your host, Owen Schreuer.
[08:18.320 --> 08:22.520]  You know, the fake news goes well beyond politics, folks, and we're going to get into some of
[08:22.520 --> 08:23.520]  this later.
[08:23.520 --> 08:26.120]  They are claiming to have found a new link in human evolution.
[08:26.120 --> 08:27.440]  That's total fake news.
[08:27.440 --> 08:31.920]  But Al Gore, and we're going to go to a report from Alex Jones talking about Al Gore's new
[08:31.920 --> 08:33.800]  video coming out, An Inconvenient Truth.
[08:33.800 --> 08:34.960]  I guess this is part two.
[08:34.960 --> 08:37.520]  An Inconvenient Truth part one, Al Gore was wrong.
[08:37.520 --> 08:40.560]  An Inconvenient Truth part two, Al Gore will be wrong again.
[08:40.560 --> 08:43.200]  But here's the watch and examiner headline, and they talk about it.
[08:43.200 --> 08:45.880]  They break it down how he's a total fool in this story.
[08:45.880 --> 08:48.600]  Al Gore's $15 trillion carbon tax.
[08:48.600 --> 08:51.920]  You know, we'll get into the story later when Alex returns, I'm sure.
[08:51.920 --> 08:57.800]  But you know that all the liberal professors are going to show the new Al Gore movie in
[08:57.800 --> 08:59.480]  their college courses.
[08:59.480 --> 09:01.040]  Let's show the old one.
[09:01.040 --> 09:04.280]  Why not show an Inconvenient Truth the original to show how wrong he was?
[09:04.280 --> 09:26.120]  Here's Alex Jones breaking down the new movie coming out.
[09:26.120 --> 09:31.080]  Climate change is an absolute 100% total fact.
[09:31.080 --> 09:35.440]  The next generation would be justified in looking back at us and asking, what were you
[09:35.440 --> 09:36.440]  thinking?
[09:36.440 --> 09:37.760]  Couldn't you hear what the scientists were saying?
[09:37.760 --> 09:41.000]  Couldn't you hear what Mother Nature was screaming at you?
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.520]  But studies by scientists, astrophysicists, you name it, prove humans don't even affect
[09:46.520 --> 09:47.840]  one percent of it.
[09:47.840 --> 09:54.160]  And Al Gore and his global corporate carbon taxes are absolutely not the solution to save
[09:54.160 --> 09:55.160]  us.
[09:55.160 --> 10:01.160]  Al Gore Paramount Classics comes a film that has shocked audiences everywhere they've seen
[10:01.160 --> 10:02.160]  it.
[10:02.160 --> 10:06.160]  I am Al Gore.
[10:06.160 --> 10:13.040]  I used to be the next president of the United States of America.
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.960]  In 2006, Al Gore put out the film, An Inconvenient Truth.
[10:17.960 --> 10:25.560]  Now in 2017, An Inconvenient Truth Part 2 is set to hit screens across the world.
[10:25.560 --> 10:31.880]  We are about to fully debunk his previous film and, of course, his current film.
[10:31.880 --> 10:37.360]  And we've also gotten a synopsis, a spoiler sneak peek of what's in the film, and of
[10:37.360 --> 10:40.240]  course we have the trailer here for review.
[10:40.240 --> 10:48.680]  An Inconvenient Load of Manure Part 2 by Mr. Gore sets him up as the savior of the world
[10:48.680 --> 10:54.320]  and someone who is on a pedestal above the people who must be listened to like he is
[10:54.320 --> 11:00.360]  Jesus Christ or Moses speaking from the mountaintop throughout the new sequel.
[11:00.360 --> 11:07.640]  We are treated to fawning minions, literally holding his hand and crying in joy that they
[11:07.640 --> 11:13.600]  have met the Christ-like figure, the archetypal savior of the world.
[11:13.600 --> 11:19.360]  The film begins as our guru, Al Gore, leads us through what's happening in the world and
[11:19.360 --> 11:26.000]  his attempts to save it and how the evil Antichrist, Donald Trump, has come to overheat the planet
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.040]  and kill us all.
[11:28.040 --> 11:34.160]  It's supposed to be 70 degrees today, it's freezing here, speaking of global warming.
[11:34.160 --> 11:41.040]  Where is, we need some global warming, it's freezing.
[11:41.040 --> 11:46.120]  Gore tells us in that down home Tennessee accent that this is our home, this is Earth
[11:46.120 --> 11:48.200]  and we've hit the peak of human development.
[11:48.200 --> 11:52.080]  We're not going to get on rocket ships and fly to Mars.
[11:52.080 --> 11:57.680]  Don't let anybody tell you that we're going to get on rocket ships and live on Mars.
[11:57.680 --> 11:58.920]  This is our home.
[11:58.920 --> 12:05.520]  The film is decidedly anti-America, we're shown how the world has unanimously come together
[12:05.520 --> 12:11.600]  through the UN and Al Gore to save the planet from evil carbon dioxide that plants breathe,
[12:11.600 --> 12:15.840]  but only the evil America and Donald Trump stands in the way.
[12:15.840 --> 12:22.920]  The truth is India, China, Mexico and over 150 other countries are exempt from the carbon
[12:22.920 --> 12:26.280]  taxes that Europe, Australia and the United States are under.
[12:26.280 --> 12:30.560]  So of course they have dirty burning coal, they have all these other systems with no
[12:30.560 --> 12:35.840]  regulations, of course they want more regulations on us so they can shut us down and that's
[12:35.840 --> 12:37.800]  what this is really all about.
[12:37.800 --> 12:44.520]  The carbon taxes were developed in the 1980s by then Senator Al Gore and Ken Lay of Enron
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.720]  fame, a way to tax the carbon cycle on the planet.
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.440]  People know oxygen is good, they know sunlight is good, they know water is good, but the
[12:52.440 --> 13:00.240]  fourth part carbon dioxide has a scary sounding name like carbon monoxide, so this life-giving
[13:00.240 --> 13:06.080]  trace gas that's at the lowest level it's ever been recorded on this planet is demonized
[13:06.080 --> 13:12.640]  and then if we pay carbon taxes to Al Gore's carbon trading company we'll all be saved.
[13:12.640 --> 13:18.480]  And of course just like Obamacare all the major companies like General Electric are
[13:18.480 --> 13:24.400]  exempt from the regulations shutting down their competitors.
[13:24.400 --> 13:29.760]  After the devil Donald Trump has introduced to us in the film we then see Al Gore telling
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.120]  you that he made a prediction that lower Manhattan would be flooded by a hurricane.
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.640]  The most criticized scene in the movie An Inconvenient Truth was showing that the combination of sea
[13:39.640 --> 13:46.040]  level rise and storm surge would flood a 9-11 memorial site and people said what a terrible
[13:46.040 --> 13:47.040]  exaggeration.
[13:47.040 --> 13:51.240]  The hurricane sadly slammed into New York City last night, flooding the World Trade
[13:51.240 --> 13:53.080]  Center site.
[13:53.080 --> 13:58.800]  That happens every decade or so on record, but he predicts specifically an area by the
[13:58.800 --> 14:04.840]  World Trade Center destruction where they put in a slurry wall and an area designed
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.920]  for the hurricanes that come in and routinely flood the area.
[14:08.920 --> 14:14.720]  So he manufactures this one prophecy that came true, but of course his new film doesn't
[14:14.720 --> 14:20.080]  get into his big prediction in 2006 that didn't come true.
[14:20.080 --> 14:26.760]  And that was that both the northern and southern ice caps, arctica and Antarctica would be
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.600]  completely melted by 2013-2014.
[14:31.600 --> 14:38.800]  He would use satellite footage that's time-lapse showing it shrinking in the spring and summer,
[14:38.800 --> 14:43.080]  but he'd cut there and not showing it get big in the fall and winter.
[14:43.080 --> 14:45.640]  That's what the ice caps do.
[14:45.640 --> 14:51.880]  The ice caps of Mars get bigger and smaller during its winter and its summers as well.
[14:51.880 --> 14:57.000]  Another big one in his previous film was the implication that polar bears couldn't swim
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.680]  when they were out hunting on ice flows and that the ice was all disappearing and they
[15:00.680 --> 15:02.360]  wouldn't have a home.
[15:02.360 --> 15:07.560]  Al Gore knows full well that the glaciers shrink again in the summer, expand in the winter,
[15:07.560 --> 15:12.840]  and that polar bears are the best land animal swimmers in the world, measured swimming over
[15:12.840 --> 15:18.960]  300 miles hunting seal walrus and of course whale.
[15:18.960 --> 15:23.400]  But again, he knows his young audience, mainly school children, don't know that.
[15:23.400 --> 15:26.120]  So it tugs at the strings of their hearts.
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.160]  He also doesn't tell them that polar bear populations are up five times what they were
[15:31.160 --> 15:33.760]  measured in the 1950s.
[15:33.760 --> 15:36.240]  But of course that's another big lie.
[15:36.240 --> 15:39.880]  First it was going to be the great ice age in the 70s and 80s that we needed carbon
[15:39.880 --> 15:40.880]  taxes for.
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.880]  Then it was going to be the great warming phase in the 90s and 2000s.
[15:45.880 --> 15:51.480]  But the last 16, 17 years conclusively, the decline in temperature has happened.
[15:51.480 --> 15:55.640]  That's why six years ago in Copenhagen at the UN summit, they had to quote, hide the
[15:55.640 --> 15:59.160]  decline and all of that came out in climategate.
[15:59.160 --> 16:04.160]  But Al Gore hopes you forget that and just believe he's the second coming of Christ and
[16:04.160 --> 16:18.080]  pay him billions, making him the carbon billionaire.
[16:18.080 --> 16:23.680]  He talks about the despair of global destruction and the forest fires and all the rest of it
[16:23.680 --> 16:26.000]  says, don't worry, there's hope.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.760]  Global governance and world carbon taxes paid to him and other select corporations.
[16:31.760 --> 16:33.760]  Let's look at those forest fires.
[16:33.760 --> 16:39.600]  It's admittedly forest service policy not letting farmers and ranchers cut fire breaks
[16:39.600 --> 16:44.960]  in the last 60 years that has caused huge mega fires to continue to spread.
[16:44.960 --> 16:48.640]  There's always been wildfires as long as there's been plants and lightning and it's part of
[16:48.640 --> 16:53.000]  the carbon cycle and produces a lot of nitrogen and other things for the soil.
[16:53.000 --> 16:59.440]  But again Al Gore points cameras at these forest fires and shows humans driving through
[16:59.440 --> 17:04.320]  them and implies that forest fires are something new on this planet.
[17:04.320 --> 17:09.560]  He says the great change we've seen is the solar farms and the big wind farms.
[17:09.560 --> 17:12.000]  But if you look at the statistics, it's clear.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.120]  Solar produces far less energy than coal, oil or natural gas.
[17:17.120 --> 17:22.520]  But it's still much better than wind who produces the least amount of any energy system out
[17:22.520 --> 17:28.960]  there and creates absolute devastation to wildlife in the areas where it's being implemented.
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.800]  But the reason Al Gore's for it is that he and his friends through government contracts
[17:33.800 --> 17:39.560]  are making hundreds of billions of dollars off the wind farms and off the solar farms.
[17:39.560 --> 17:41.960]  But there's something even more insidious here.
[17:41.960 --> 17:46.760]  They get to imply that they're cutting edge, that they are there promoting new technologies
[17:46.760 --> 17:52.440]  when they're the ones blocking fish infusion, zero point energy, carburetors that where
[17:52.440 --> 17:58.360]  you can go 100 miles on a single gallon and so many other systems of so-called disruptive
[17:58.360 --> 18:03.600]  technologies we know the globalists have been blocking the development and deployment
[18:03.600 --> 18:05.560]  of in the last 60 years.
[18:05.560 --> 18:10.480]  I saw in the news just a few days ago that Bill Nye's latest episode of his TV show was
[18:10.480 --> 18:14.560]  about how we shouldn't have more than one child like China and how we should be penalized
[18:14.560 --> 18:15.560]  if we do.
[18:15.560 --> 18:17.040]  And then I noticed the name of the show.
[18:17.040 --> 18:18.880]  I hadn't seen it on Netflix.
[18:18.880 --> 18:21.360]  Bill Nye Saves the World.
[18:21.360 --> 18:25.320]  When I saw that trailer for Al Gore's new film a few weeks ago, I was intending to shoot
[18:25.320 --> 18:28.840]  this review and call it Al Gore Saves the World.
[18:28.840 --> 18:32.480]  But you actually look at the people pushing the modern environmental agenda.
[18:32.480 --> 18:34.880]  It's all about cutting off human resources.
[18:34.880 --> 18:40.680]  All about saying humans are cast as the bad guys except for the elite who are busy reducing
[18:40.680 --> 18:44.560]  our population and enslaving us all for our own good.
[18:44.560 --> 18:51.080]  Al Gore and Bill Nye are a bunch of eugenicist globalist on record.
[18:51.080 --> 18:52.520]  This is not about the environment.
[18:52.520 --> 18:55.280]  It's about making carbon the evil.
[18:55.280 --> 19:02.440]  Instead of genetic engineering, cross-human animal chimeras, open-air pollination of cross-species
[19:02.440 --> 19:08.680]  pharmacological crops, massive rise of new bacteria and mutated viruses that threaten
[19:08.680 --> 19:13.120]  not just human life but human life on the face of this globe.
[19:13.120 --> 19:19.880]  This movement is in the tradition of every great movement that has advanced humankind.
[19:19.880 --> 19:24.680]  They want a system, a new dark age for the general public, where they use environmentalism
[19:24.680 --> 19:28.800]  and political correctness to shut down free thought and bring in a great psychological
[19:28.800 --> 19:29.800]  tyranny.
[19:29.800 --> 19:34.840]  We need to expose Al Gore's last film and his latest fraud for what it is.
[19:34.840 --> 19:41.160]  A piece of sophistic fraud meant to demonize humanity, make us hate ourselves and turn
[19:41.160 --> 19:47.160]  off our life force so the parasite globalist can rule and control us into the future.
[19:47.160 --> 19:50.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[19:50.320 --> 19:54.480]  It's Tuesday, the ninth day of May, 2017.
[19:54.480 --> 19:57.040]  Get ready because I'm locked and loaded straight ahead.
[19:57.040 --> 20:00.320]  It is an act of resistance against tyranny to spread our show.
[20:00.320 --> 20:04.800]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark U.S. government study
[20:04.800 --> 20:09.920]  confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:32.160]  Canada has Trudeau.
[1:57:32.160 --> 1:57:34.160]  France has Macron.
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:36.160]  So as far as the Western world, there's still a lot of battles.
[1:57:36.160 --> 1:57:40.160]  But in America, no one takes these leftist nuts seriously anymore.
[1:57:40.160 --> 1:57:42.160]  They see them as loonies.
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:47.160]  I think they screwed up by bringing trans into the game and all these mentally ill people poured in.
[1:57:47.160 --> 1:57:53.160]  And now they go, aren't you the guys that scream about bathrooms and put pepper spray in people's eyes when they try to have a speech?
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:56.160]  So everything you see right now is a death knell.
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:57:59.160]  It's a fish swapping in the boat, screaming hysterically.
[1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:01.160]  But they're done.
[1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:07.160]  And since we're talking about winning too, it's always worth mentioning and it seems to be forgotten a lot is what's going on in Brazil right now.
[1:58:07.160 --> 1:58:14.160]  Brazil is actually probably leading the way for draining the swamp, much like Iceland did with the central bankers a few years ago.
[1:58:14.160 --> 1:58:17.160]  We got a lot of visitors from Brazil. They love it. Yeah, they're awake.
[1:58:17.160 --> 1:58:19.160]  Brazil is the only one that asks you about this.
[1:58:19.160 --> 1:58:21.160]  What's next when we're back in 70 seconds?
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:28.160]  Five more minutes with Gavin McGinnis and then Mark Dice joined just they've had the new Gender Neutral MTV Awards.
[1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:37.160]  Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour and more straight ahead and they've discovered Saturn's mysterious hexagonal storm.
[1:58:37.160 --> 1:58:39.160]  Stay with us.

[1:59:11.160 --> 1:59:13.160]  Welcome to GCNLive.com.
[1:59:41.160 --> 1:59:44.160]  This is the essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.

[1:59:52.160 --> 2:00:01.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:01.160 --> 2:00:12.160]  Another world. Another time.
[2:00:12.160 --> 2:00:17.160]  In the age of wonder.
[2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:22.160]  Another world. Another time.
[2:00:22.160 --> 2:00:25.160]  This life was green and good.
[2:00:25.160 --> 2:00:32.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:32.160 --> 2:00:37.160]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:39.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:42.160]  My evil extends across all time.
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:46.160]  All galaxies, all dimensions.
[2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:52.160]  Look into me one last time.
[2:00:52.160 --> 2:00:55.160]  Got him again. This is our guest. I want to show you a shot gun with me.
[2:00:55.160 --> 2:00:59.160]  Got a bunch of other guests coming up in the next segment.
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:01.160]  Drudge had this length. I didn't get to it yet.
[2:01:01.160 --> 2:01:04.160]  But it's the threat of nuclear war.
[2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:06.160]  North Korea is threatening to nuke everybody.
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:07.160]  All these countries are out of control.
[2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:09.160]  Russia is the only country actually not threatening us.
[2:01:09.160 --> 2:01:11.160]  I'm not some Russia file.
[2:01:11.160 --> 2:01:12.160]  Russ file.
[2:01:12.160 --> 2:01:14.160]  I've not been to Russia, whatever.
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:16.160]  It's just like a geopolitical look.
[2:01:16.160 --> 2:01:18.160]  They're being ganged up on by the globalists as well.
[2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:19.160]  No, quit calling it like it is.
[2:01:19.160 --> 2:01:21.160]  They're fighting radical Islam.
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:25.160]  And I do see Trump becoming more and more chumped by this.
[2:01:25.160 --> 2:01:27.160]  And notice the more he gives in to John McCain,
[2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:29.160]  the more they say he's a Russian agent.
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:33.160]  And oh my God, once General Flynn went and hosted a show
[2:01:33.160 --> 2:01:34.160]  and got paid to go to Russia,
[2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:37.160]  that's all these generals do is get paid to go give speeches.
[2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:40.160]  Obama's about to get paid millions for some new damn speech.
[2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:43.160]  So Gavin, let's be critical of Trump.
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:45.160]  I mean, I love Trump. He's totally delivering.
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:50.160]  But optically, he is kind of getting chumped by going along
[2:01:50.160 --> 2:01:54.160]  with this whole thing that he's got to prove he's tough on Russia
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:01:55.160]  and people.
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:01:57.160]  I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:01:59.160]  Well, I like Syria.
[2:01:59.160 --> 2:02:02.160]  I thought it was a fun little fireworks show that I call it
[2:02:02.160 --> 2:02:04.160]  40 chests in four different ways.
[2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:05.160]  No, I get it.
[2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:06.160]  Blow up the empty base.
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:08.160]  Look tough, but it hasn't backed them off.
[2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:09.160]  Yeah, I like that part.
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:10.160]  But I'll tell you why.
[2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:13.160]  It's hard to disagree with Coulter when she says,
[2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:15.160]  where's the wall?
[2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:17.160]  Can we have one brick please?
[2:02:17.160 --> 2:02:19.160]  Can we have a little bit of fence?
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:24.160]  You know, that was a big, you know, one of his biggest campaign
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:25.160]  things.
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:28.160]  And what I found Alex, when I talked to people at his events,
[2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:31.160]  when I do polls on Twitter, the wall is number one.
[2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:32.160]  There's the deal.
[2:02:32.160 --> 2:02:33.160]  He's delivering on the economy.
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:35.160]  He's delivering on Glass-Steagall.
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:36.160]  He's amazing.
[2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:38.160]  I feel bad even when I'm critical of him.
[2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:41.160]  But Gavin, let me ask this last two minutes we have left.
[2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:42.160]  You've got so much on your mind.
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:43.160]  What else are you focused on?
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:46.160]  What other tidbits do you want to impart to this audience?
[2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:48.160]  To keep fighting for free speech.
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:52.160]  I think the amendments are in order of importance.
[2:02:52.160 --> 2:02:56.160]  The second is the second most important amendment.
[2:02:56.160 --> 2:02:59.160]  I think it's because with the First Amendment, with free speech,
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:04.160]  you get to explain to people counterintuitive concepts like more guns, less crime.
[2:03:04.160 --> 2:03:07.160]  You benefit everyone with the First Amendment.
[2:03:07.160 --> 2:03:08.160]  And you know what?
[2:03:08.160 --> 2:03:11.160]  The government wasn't so bad with free speech.
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:14.160]  In the past few years, the Supreme Court's been pretty good with that.
[2:03:14.160 --> 2:03:17.160]  It's the people that didn't seem to understand it.
[2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:20.160]  They wanted you fired when you used a bad word.
[2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:23.160]  They wanted to take your kids away when you're the kind of guy
[2:03:23.160 --> 2:03:27.160]  who never stops talking about his kids like, say, Alex Jones.
[2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:31.160]  They wanted to shut down entire companies because they donated to the wrong thing.
[2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:33.160]  And that is finally changing.
[2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:36.160]  That culture where Americans are against free speech.
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:37.160]  And that's what Trump's really done is say,
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:39.160]  no, the bully's not a political correctness.
[2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:40.160]  That's the big victory.
[2:03:40.160 --> 2:03:41.160]  Yeah.
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:44.160]  I mean, I'll never forget when he was saying anchor baby and someone said,
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:48.160]  why do you use that term? It is offensive as some Mexican journalist.
[2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:49.160]  And he goes, what do you want me to say?
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:50.160]  And the guy hadn't even thought of it.
[2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:54.160]  He said, maybe a undocumented child of foreign born.
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:56.160]  And he goes, nah, I'm saying anchor baby.
[2:03:56.160 --> 2:03:59.160]  And that's all of America went.
[2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:02.160]  Finally, we can just speak normally again.
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:04.160]  We can be Americans again.
[2:04:04.160 --> 2:04:06.160]  All right, Gavin McGinnis.
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:07.160]  Thank you so much.
[2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:10.160]  I love how you guys are shooting interviews like in the interest of the building.
[2:04:10.160 --> 2:04:11.160]  It's kind of cool though.
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:14.160]  Like these people are like super like fishbongers. Oh, I got this.
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:15.160]  I got that.
[2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:16.160]  We're doing this.
[2:04:16.160 --> 2:04:17.160]  Everything.
[2:04:17.160 --> 2:04:18.160]  It's kind of a fun thing you're doing there.
[2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:20.160]  Gavin, thank you so much for the time.
[2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:21.160]  Sure is Alex.
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:22.160]  Thanks for having me.
[2:04:22.160 --> 2:04:23.160]  Let me ask this 30 second question.
[2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:25.160]  Do you think Trump can select into a second term?
[2:04:25.160 --> 2:04:27.160]  Or does he just not even want to do it like LBJ?
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:29.160]  He's definitely getting elected to a second term.
[2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:30.160]  He's got a lot of work to do.
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:33.160]  We've got to, we've got to get rid of Kushner and the neocons.
[2:04:33.160 --> 2:04:34.160]  We've got to build that wall.
[2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:38.160]  And if there's one president on earth who needs two terms to do all he's going to do,
[2:04:38.160 --> 2:04:39.160]  it's Trump.
[2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:41.160]  I mean, we had Obama wrecking the...
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:43.160]  I agree, but he needs our love.
[2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:44.160]  He's actually real.
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:45.160]  He actually needs our love.
[2:04:45.160 --> 2:04:46.160]  Gavin, thank you so much, my friend.
[2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:47.160]  Cheers.
[2:04:47.160 --> 2:04:48.160]  Oh, it's great to have him on.
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:49.160]  I'm just staying with me.
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:51.160]  I'm just glad with Trump we'll have another election.
[2:04:51.160 --> 2:04:52.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:54.160]  Mark Dice is coming up.
[2:04:54.160 --> 2:05:20.160]  We're going to get into the whole, whole trans MTV Awards.
[2:05:25.160 --> 2:05:31.160]  So, of course, there's going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that vaccines are not really safe.
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:34.160]  And people are going to come out and attack it and say, oh, they just talked to parents.
[2:05:34.160 --> 2:05:36.160]  Or they'll say, oh, there was a bias in the study.
[2:05:36.160 --> 2:05:38.160]  These people think vaccines are unsafe.
[2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:40.160]  One, the study proves they're unsafe.
[2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:44.160]  And two, any other vaccine study is done and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies.
[2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:46.160]  Of course, they think vaccines are safe.
[2:05:46.160 --> 2:05:50.160]  Just go to our article, bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier.
[2:05:50.160 --> 2:05:53.160]  We have archive links to the studies and you can see for yourself.
[2:05:53.160 --> 2:05:56.160]  Because drug companies will do anything to keep you from the truth.
[2:05:56.160 --> 2:05:59.160]  Rob Dew reporting for info wars.com and info wars nightly news.
[2:05:59.160 --> 2:06:05.160]  After being sold out for months, our best selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at info wars store.com.
[2:06:05.160 --> 2:06:07.160]  Research across the board is clear.
[2:06:07.160 --> 2:06:12.160]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.

[2:06:34.160 --> 2:06:41.160]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[2:06:41.160 --> 2:06:46.160]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[2:06:46.160 --> 2:06:50.160]  We have created the new bubble gum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.
[2:06:50.160 --> 2:06:59.160]  Learn more about the new bubble gum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[2:07:58.160 --> 2:08:11.160]  Out of my way, globalists. You want to be slaves? Go ahead and do it. Not me.
[2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:13.160]  From the front lines.
[2:08:13.160 --> 2:08:18.160]  From the front lines of the Information War. It's Alex Jones.
[2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:21.160]  Out of my way, out of my days.
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:28.160]  Well, Mark Dice, I first met in 2006, 11 years ago. He'd been active for years before that.
[2:08:28.160 --> 2:08:35.160]  He's got a degree in media and analysis and PR and he's changed the world.
[2:08:35.160 --> 2:08:37.160]  He's reached billions of people.
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:39.160]  Billions of people on YouTube alone.
[2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:40.160]  He's been censored.
[2:08:40.160 --> 2:08:41.160]  He's been blocked.
[2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:43.160]  He's been banned off YouTube before.
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:45.160]  He's been to the gauntlet.
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:52.160]  And that's really the mark of somebody that's really doing the right thing is that they're banned, they're blocked, they're attacked.
[2:08:52.160 --> 2:08:54.160]  And so I don't want to build us up here.
[2:08:54.160 --> 2:08:57.160]  But know this, Mark Dice, they're trying to block.
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:08:59.160]  They tried to buy off and he wouldn't sell out.
[2:08:59.160 --> 2:09:01.160]  They tried to block me. They tried to get me to sell out.
[2:09:01.160 --> 2:09:08.160]  But it's not hard to not sell out when you realize you're selling out to a loser system.
[2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:13.160]  I'd sell out to some new great system that was so free and empowering people.
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:17.160]  Please let me have a power structure to work with.
[2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:20.160]  I don't want to just be out here like the Lone Ranger all day.
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:22.160]  I'm ready to work with people.
[2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:24.160]  I'm ready to have bosses over me.
[2:09:24.160 --> 2:09:29.160]  Please show me somebody that is more committed than I am.
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:36.160]  But it's great to see Mark going from reaching millions a week to millions a day in all his work.
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:44.160]  And just to illustrate the insanity and the attempted overthrow of reality that is going on with the MTV Awards and all the rest of it.
[2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:46.160]  And just the hate.
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:50.160]  And we were putting a video together of Maxine Waters going,
[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:52.160]  My millennials stay woke.
[2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:54.160]  We're the resistance.
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:10:04.160]  This establishment crone like Pelosi, not knowing who's president, just dumber than a third grader.
[2:10:04.160 --> 2:10:11.160]  When it comes to geopolitical issues and they're in charge, they're in charge because the spiders up above them want dumbasses in play.
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:14.160]  So Mark Dice, Mark Dice.com.
[2:10:14.160 --> 2:10:22.160]  Let's go to this clip of him just yesterday, breaking down the MTV Awards and their psychological warfare.
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:23.160]  We'll go to Mark Dice.
[2:10:23.160 --> 2:10:24.160]  Here it is.
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:31.160]  The MTV Movie Awards went full blown social justice warrior this year so far over the top that it's difficult to wrap your mind around the insanity.
[2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:36.160]  I know what you're thinking. MTV is still on the air? Yes, but not because it's a profitable network,
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:40.160]  but rather because it is a leftist subsidized enemy propaganda program.
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:44.160]  The show was kicked off by this idiot who looked like he was dressed as boffamette,
[2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:46.160]  who just crawled out of the pits of hell,
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:50.160]  and a performance supposedly dedicated to Beauty and the Beast,
[2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:55.160]  which I could only assume is probably just a wink and a nod to MTV's supportive bestiality,
[2:10:55.160 --> 2:10:59.160]  considering they did an entire performance last year about having sex with animals.
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:05.160]  Oh, I'm not kidding. They did an entire dance number simulating sex with animals called Leo Got F***ed by a Bear.
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:08.160]  After the bizarre opening sequence, they introduced the first presenter,
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:17.160]  which is this gender non-binary actress, Asia Kate Dillon, who they said is the breakout star of 2017.
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:21.160]  I've never heard of her. I'm sorry. She doesn't go by he or she.
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:25.160]  Gender non-binary means that they are neither male nor female.
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:34.160]  So when I went to its Twitter account, I realized that the breakout star of 2017 barely had 7,000 followers.
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:39.160]  In fact, the entire theme of the 2017 MTV Movie Awards was that of gender bending,
[2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:44.160]  and they did away with the different categories for men and women because that's just sexist.
[2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:48.160]  Instead, they united the categories into just best person.
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:51.160]  Let's have this new gender non-binary actress try to explain this to us.
[2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:58.160]  If you don't know me, my name is Asia Kate Dillon.
[2:11:58.160 --> 2:12:00.160]  We don't know you. Thank you.
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:01.160]  This year has been for...
[2:12:01.160 --> 2:12:03.160]  I don't have children.
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:11.160]  I'm the first openly non-binary actor to play a non-binary character on a major television show.
[2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:14.160]  Fist juice. What the hell is going on over here?
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:20.400]  And now, it's so cool to be here presenting the first acting award ever that celebrates
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:23.400]  performance free of any gender distinctions.
[2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:26.400]  Because genders are humanity.
[2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:29.400]  This is an enormous stand.
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:35.400]  Tonight, we celebrate portrayals of the human experience because the only distinction we
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:40.400]  should be making when it comes to awards is between each outstanding performance.
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:47.080]  Yes, that's right. Now, the award for best actor or best actress is considered to be
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:48.080]  sexist.
[2:12:48.080 --> 2:12:50.080]  Oh, this is just the beginning of the insanity.
[2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:53.200]  I literally feel ill after having watched most of the show.
[2:12:53.200 --> 2:12:57.080]  The first award went to Emma Watson, who I can't even believe I'm wasting brain cells
[2:12:57.080 --> 2:12:58.080]  remembering her name.
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:03.080]  And when she took to the stage to thank everybody, she took the gender-bending baton and decided
[2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:04.080]  to keep running with it.
[2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:11.480]  Firstly, I feel I have to say something about the award itself. The first acting award in
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:18.960]  history that doesn't separate nominees based on their sex says something about how...
[2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:23.200]  By the way, that's a transgender woman named Gigi Gorgeous, of course, seated in the front
[2:13:23.200 --> 2:13:27.840]  row with the camera cutting directly to her, the fact that I even know her name is probably
[2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:29.840]  going to give me brain cancer.
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:39.760]  And we... about how we perceive the human experience and TV's move to create a genderless
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:46.080]  award for acting will mean something different to everyone, but to me...
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:49.560]  Of course, she's just not reading this off the teleprompter. This is just off the top
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:55.120]  of her head, right? This certainly is inscripted. The entire award show is nothing but the most
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:14:01.960]  far-left liberal propaganda. In fact, the award for best kiss went to these two guys.
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:06.000]  When this woman won an award, she got on stage and started crying about how great diversity
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:10.320]  is. And I'm sorry to tell you Fast and Furious fans, but when Vin Diesel got on stage to
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:15.480]  accept the Generation Award for the Fast and Furious franchise, he said that the only
[2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:21.400]  reason that it was a success is because the younger generations have been open and accepting
[2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:25.840]  to multiculturalism. Oh, you don't believe me? Well, you must be a new viewer then. I'll
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:29.320]  show you the clip in just a second, because all the long-time viewers know that I don't
[2:14:29.320 --> 2:14:30.320]  bully people.
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:35.320]  But most importantly, I got to thank our generation.
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:36.320]  Most importantly?
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:37.320]  Our generation.
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:38.320]  Most importantly.
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:47.320]  I got to thank our generation that was willing to accept this multicultural franchise where
[2:14:47.320 --> 2:14:50.280]  it didn't matter what color your skin was or what country you belong to.
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:54.560]  I'm willing to accept. What the hell does that mean? I wouldn't watch your family.
[2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:59.360]  Wasn't the Cosby show like one of the top TV shows on television 30 years ago? White
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:04.000]  America accepted that. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot how that turned out. Bill Cosby's on trial
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:07.880]  for like, drugging and raping dozens of women. Okay, you pretty much get the point by now.
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:13.560]  MTV is just pure cultural poison, trying to promote the most perverted and abnormal behaviors
[2:15:13.560 --> 2:15:18.000]  as if it were not only normal, but cool and something to be celebrated.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  It's like a hip-hop.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:25.880]  How much? Subscribe to my channel at MarkDice.com and on YouTube. Let me skip this break so
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:31.040]  Mark has more time here with us. But again, I don't care if my things are a man or a woman.
[2:15:31.040 --> 2:15:35.760]  It's that they're force feeding it to kids. It's the end having children. This is biological
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:41.680]  chemical warfare. Mark Dice, you're covering all this. The globalist left only seems to
[2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:46.600]  be intensifying their efforts right now. Where would you state the state of the world is
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:50.800]  right now? We're in the middle of a battle. I mean, having
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:55.160]  Trump winning was a tremendous victory, but the left came back pretty viciously. First,
[2:15:55.160 --> 2:15:59.560]  they called us all alt-right, trying to smear us as white supremacists. Then they called
[2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:03.960]  us fake news. Now they're just going after our wallet and trying to strip our advertisers
[2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:08.680]  and are stripping our advertisers and really trying to de-platform us. Just yesterday, Alex,
[2:16:08.680 --> 2:16:12.160]  I got a warning from Twitter saying that a meme that I had posted saying that there are
[2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:18.080]  only two genders is being investigated for being possible, hateful, and a violation.
[2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:22.800]  Now, I'm sure that most of my posts get reported, get flagged. This is the first time that they
[2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:28.080]  have ever actually emailed me in saying that this post is under investigation. So not only
[2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:33.880]  are they pushing this just cultural poison as if it's normal and as if it's cool as
[2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:41.880]  this new non-binary breakout star is supposedly some superhero, but any opposition to it,
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:48.560]  any jokes about them, any reasonable arguments countering their insanity is considered to
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:53.880]  be hate speech. Now, just a few weeks ago, I was banned on Facebook suspended for a week
[2:16:53.880 --> 2:17:00.600]  for posting a link to a story about a Dove soap commercial that featured real mothers,
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:06.160]  wasn't actors, and so it was called real moms. And one of the quote moms was a transgender
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:13.040]  man who identifies as this newborn baby's mother. Let's be clear, you're not a woman
[2:17:13.040 --> 2:17:17.240]  just like Bill Nye banning saying chromosomes make male and female. You can say you're a
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:22.280]  woman if you want, but we're not going to believe your false science garbage. And that's
[2:17:22.280 --> 2:17:26.680]  one aspect. Now they want to push it to the next where there's the 58 different genders
[2:17:26.680 --> 2:17:31.400]  or really unlimited genders just to make up their total societal collapse. What's behind
[2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:37.520]  this, Mark Dice? This is to finally break up the fabric of society. This is the missile
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:43.760]  to destroy the nuclear family. It is to make the government the new God so that the government
[2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:50.160]  and the media, which is really largely in collaboration, controls the quote truth, dictates
[2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:56.440]  what is real. This is such a science fiction movie. Can you believe it's this crazy? I started
[2:17:56.440 --> 2:18:01.560]  out 20 something years ago. You like 17 years ago. Could you believe Mark? We'd be in such
[2:18:01.560 --> 2:18:07.120]  an insane asylum. No, we saw what was coming, but it's far beyond what we could have even
[2:18:07.120 --> 2:18:13.480]  imagined. And in George Orwell's 1984, at least there were only two different genders.
[2:18:13.480 --> 2:18:18.160]  Now you're considered to be neither male nor female or your gender fluid. Sometimes it
[2:18:18.160 --> 2:18:23.280]  changes and they want everybody to be bisexual. It's brave new world. It's brave new world.
[2:18:23.280 --> 2:18:29.600]  It is. It's beyond a science fiction fantasy. Now, Facebook suspended me for making a joke
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:36.320]  about the dove transgender quote mother commercial by saying that I need some Irish spring, which
[2:18:36.320 --> 2:18:40.640]  is a competitor's brand of soap to clean up the puke because the commercial made me sick.
[2:18:40.640 --> 2:18:45.200]  They said that that was hateful and they suspended me for practice. It's hateful for them to
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:51.960]  tell you a man can have a baby, which denigrates women. It's a war against reality. First of
[2:18:51.960 --> 2:18:56.360]  all, it wasn't hateful. Second of all, it was a joke. And third of all, they let all
[2:18:56.360 --> 2:19:01.120]  the leftists run around saying kill conservatives, kill Trump all day. We'll get this. So a few
[2:19:01.120 --> 2:19:07.840]  weeks ago, I came across a video on faith on YouTube, which was a clear criminal intent,
[2:19:07.840 --> 2:19:12.760]  someone calling for the murder of police. And I saw you cover it and nothing was done.
[2:19:12.760 --> 2:19:17.080]  And this wasn't just a random guy talking about black. I mean, it was, it was so vicious
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:22.920]  and so despicable that I didn't want to publicize it because I don't want to give the person
[2:19:22.920 --> 2:19:28.240]  any credit. He was being investigated by multiple agencies. I have later come to realize, but
[2:19:28.240 --> 2:19:31.640]  I reported it to Facebook or to YouTube. I flagged. I heard the, I don't care what anybody
[2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:36.760]  says, but you can't do what he's doing. It was beyond incitement. It was, it was a clear,
[2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:41.600]  you know, criminal video. YouTube got back to me and said that they reviewed it and said
[2:19:41.600 --> 2:19:43.240]  it did not violate the policies.
[2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:47.280]  Okay. Well, I saw you covered separate ones. So it's a video saying go out and kill police,
[2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:49.160]  how to do it. And that's allowed.
[2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:54.640]  The title of the video, Alex was kill all cops. And he was talking about how people
[2:19:54.640 --> 2:19:56.400]  need to go and kill police officers.
[2:19:56.400 --> 2:20:00.920]  But then meanwhile, we can't show Muslims attacking police. We're not in some police
[2:20:00.920 --> 2:20:04.440]  butt kissing thing. We criticize cops when they're bad, but we don't just as a group
[2:20:04.440 --> 2:20:10.720]  say they deserve to die or black people or Hispanics or women. It's like as real cultural
[2:20:10.720 --> 2:20:17.120]  liberals, my liberal, we're for freedom. We're against this. So it's, it's crazy.
[2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:21.560]  With the whole fire coal bear hashtag, I don't, I don't support having him pulled from
[2:20:21.560 --> 2:20:25.200]  the airwaves. I don't think he should be fired. He should be able to say sure, but he promotes
[2:20:25.200 --> 2:20:26.640]  for each destruction.
[2:20:26.640 --> 2:20:30.440]  Yeah. Without criminal incitement, he should be able to say whatever he wants to. I just
[2:20:30.440 --> 2:20:35.240]  wanted to end to the double standard. And in fact, I was, I was referencing that saying
[2:20:35.240 --> 2:20:40.280]  on social media, how if you use certain words to describe certain segments of the liberal
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:44.880]  population, you know, a word that, you know, starts with an F and rhymes with the maggots,
[2:20:44.880 --> 2:20:50.920]  right? Or a particular part of a vehicle that is also used to describe, but it's transgenderism.
[2:20:50.920 --> 2:20:54.040]  They want you banned because you use those words.
[2:20:54.040 --> 2:20:58.720]  I was going to ask you this wire trainees who, hey, have a great life. I don't care.
[2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:03.040]  And Muslims so protected, they're like the new gods.
[2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:06.520]  It's, and again, it's not just transgenderism. I mean, let's just say that there is a birth
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:10.920]  effect that some people have in a, in a rare case where they have a female brain developed
[2:21:10.920 --> 2:21:11.920]  in a male body.
[2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:12.920]  That's right.
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:16.040]  Let's just say that that's the case. Then there should be, we should be finding a cure.
[2:21:16.040 --> 2:21:20.280]  We should be people are attracted to the same sex. Women, women. I mean, I'm Christian.
[2:21:20.280 --> 2:21:23.480]  I get it. But I mean, I'm attracted to women. I get women like a woman. I, as long as you
[2:21:23.480 --> 2:21:29.480]  don't hurt somebody, their adults, whatever, my thing is, why are you forcing it on kids?
[2:21:29.480 --> 2:21:34.240]  Kids believe that Santa Claus flies around the entire world and brings presence to people.
[2:21:34.240 --> 2:21:38.520]  Things can be taught in condition to believe. You're a five-year-old boy that you're a girl.
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:40.360]  Yeah. And, and so this is the,
[2:21:40.360 --> 2:21:43.920]  That's all religious, your teacher wants to stick their wee wee in you.
[2:21:43.920 --> 2:21:48.120]  This is to get the society so broken down. So there's no moral compass through the family,
[2:21:48.120 --> 2:21:52.080]  through religion, so that they only look to their celebrity gods and to the government
[2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:55.000]  dictating what is the moral compass.
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:59.040]  And I agree. And there's a total rejection of Hollywood. Where do you see this going?
[2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:04.400]  You know, we've, this was the first year that YouTube was seen as a platform, not just for
[2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:10.000]  funny cat videos, not just for sharing news clips, but where people like me and people
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:16.400]  like you and, and hundreds of thousands of others can use the platform to amass subscriber
[2:22:16.400 --> 2:22:18.520]  bases of millions of people.
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:23.720]  It was seen as a war machine against globalism, a free speech sub box. Now they're panicking.
[2:22:23.720 --> 2:22:29.200]  Yeah. And so that's why, I mean, most news channels have been virtually demonetized.
[2:22:29.200 --> 2:22:34.400]  And so it's under this disguise, this cloak of, it's to stop hateful content.
[2:22:34.400 --> 2:22:38.800]  And I love how they think if they demonetize news, we're going to stop telling the truth
[2:22:38.800 --> 2:22:42.280]  like we only care about money. That hasn't worked, has it, Mark?
[2:22:42.280 --> 2:22:47.600]  It only blows up in their face because there's other ways to become fan funded as your, your
[2:22:47.600 --> 2:22:52.880]  revenue model has changed over the last few years. And you are, you know, a self promoted
[2:22:52.880 --> 2:22:56.960]  self made guy because of their attacks, their attacks made us stronger.
[2:22:56.960 --> 2:23:02.720]  Yes. And so this, this only confirms everything that we've been saying. The YouTube CEO, a
[2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:07.640]  woman named Susan Wojcicki just did an interview with CNN last week and Poppy Harlow was interviewing
[2:23:07.640 --> 2:23:13.200]  her and asked her what kind of sexism problems are there in Silicon Valley? And she sat there
[2:23:13.200 --> 2:23:17.080]  and she hand in HOD. She couldn't come up with anything other than saying that there's
[2:23:17.080 --> 2:23:22.280]  not enough women in Silicon Valley, which that's not a sexism problem. There's not
[2:23:22.280 --> 2:23:27.440]  enough women in the, in the bricklaying industry either. There's not enough women, you know,
[2:23:27.440 --> 2:23:32.600]  roofing. Okay. There's women, women to run stuff as long as they do the job. I don't
[2:23:32.600 --> 2:23:37.520]  give a damn what you got between your legs. Sometimes women just don't like to be in particular
[2:23:37.520 --> 2:23:38.520]  industries. Okay.
[2:23:38.520 --> 2:23:43.960]  Let's just say women on average like to go find a big powerful man that they run who
[2:23:43.960 --> 2:23:47.880]  then takes care of them. It's not that they're weak. They're really the species. Men are
[2:23:47.880 --> 2:23:53.880]  created sexually chosen by the woman to serve them. So women have given up their big power
[2:23:53.880 --> 2:23:58.200]  role. Don't even get it. Men march off to war. Men build big buildings. They build these
[2:23:58.200 --> 2:24:02.360]  giant nest for women. Women don't get their running stuff. The globalists have convinced
[2:24:02.360 --> 2:24:08.160]  women to give up their power and give it to the state. The women are the state.
[2:24:08.160 --> 2:24:12.960]  Now this woman, the CEO of YouTube, one of the most powerful websites in the entire world,
[2:24:12.960 --> 2:24:18.920]  as you know, said that the sexism that she has experienced are, quote, microaggressions.
[2:24:18.920 --> 2:24:24.600]  This video is on my YouTube channel when people interrupt her when she's talking. Now you're
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:25.600]  in Silicon Valley.
[2:24:25.600 --> 2:24:28.600]  I've been interrupting you constantly. Is that a microaggression?
[2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:32.440]  And it's sexist too, apparently, because only men interrupt women when they're talking,
[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:38.480]  right? So her sexism that she's been facing, the problem of Silicon Valley is men interrupting
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:44.360]  women when they're talking. In an industry filled with alpha males and alpha females.
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:47.360]  Constantly interrupt everybody. People brainstorming and she's very angry.
[2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:50.600]  I get in meetings with alpha males. I don't even get to talk.
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:54.920]  And that was her example of sexism. This is the woman who's running YouTube.
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:25:00.200]  She's making $50 million a year in benching. Oh, and by the way, now she may not, you know,
[2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:03.840]  there may not be a big sexism problem over there in the industry, but there certainly
[2:25:03.840 --> 2:25:10.120]  appears to be some nepotism behind her career because her sister married the Google co-founder
[2:25:10.120 --> 2:25:15.680]  Sergey Brin. So it appears that the only real reason why she got that job is because
[2:25:15.680 --> 2:25:19.920]  of little nepotism there. Google, obviously, the parent company of YouTube.
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:24.960]  But these are the people who are running the most powerful platform who are rolling out
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:30.440]  these new rules about, oh, that's offensive. That's sensitive. My entire channel has been
[2:25:30.440 --> 2:25:36.760]  flagged as sensitive content. Hundreds of videos completely demonetized because of
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:42.000]  the new algorithm. I mean, it's virtually, it might as well be completely demonetized.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.760]  And that's what they're trying to do to stop people like me.
[2:25:44.760 --> 2:25:49.000]  But the good news is people can buy your books, go to your website, support you knowing we're
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:53.520]  under attack. Go to infowarstore.com, buy great products you need anyways, and literally
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:25:57.280]  stick a stick in the eye of these control freaks who wouldn't even have a website if
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:00.960]  it wasn't for us. All this does is make us stronger. It just
[2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:05.400]  gives us more ammo to show that they're trying to shut us down. It causes more people to
[2:26:05.400 --> 2:26:10.040]  come after Facebook banned me for a week. Breitbart did an article about it, and then more people
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:14.840]  came to see what's going on. Why are they suspending somebody about a joke about a transgender
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:18.600]  soap commercial? Oh, and by the way, in Dove, the transgender
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:24.120]  mom commercial, Alex, they're coming out with new shampoos, new social justice warrior shampoo
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:32.640]  bottles, because a shampoo bottle apparently is sexist and it's against heavier, larger
[2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:37.200]  women because the bottle they think represents the shape of a woman's body. So now they're
[2:26:37.200 --> 2:26:43.560]  coming out with eight different shapes of shampoo bottles so that women can buy a shampoo
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:47.800]  bottle that reflects their body type. This is designed to turn people into mentally
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:52.400]  old basket cases. It's so obvious. We're going to come back from break and close some clips
[2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:57.840]  to get your take on it, but now more than ever, people have to realize this is an assault
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:04.000]  on the species. Where is this coming from, Mark? I mean, it world government, microchips.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:09.760]  I mean, it's in the news today on infowars.com that your smartphones are communicating with
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:14.040]  your TVs and spying on you. I mean, it's just crazy.
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:19.360]  It's been an old plan that's been in motion for a long time, and they have the technology,
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:24.400]  they have the money, they have the funding, and now they have the distraction of society,
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:28.960]  the detachment of people from reality, from real news, the breakdown of the family now
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:34.800]  going into its third generation. And so that's why, you know, there's still a lot of hope.
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:38.040]  It's still just the battle is really heating up because
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:41.720]  Sure, but I mean, as Christians, you look at this, there's no way people are directing
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:45.760]  this. I mean, you study this weirdness and how it works and everything, you can really
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:51.880]  see there's like an anti-human force. Whatever it is, this, we're on a planet and space and
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:56.440]  I mean, this is a science fiction movie, bro. Yeah, we're definitely in the middle of Bible
[2:27:56.440 --> 2:28:00.640]  prophecy, probably really on the on the on the kind of the last few chapters of Bible
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:05.600]  prophecy being fulfilled and is intelligent as we think we are. We're using this technology
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:10.120]  to communicate with across the country and we've figured out humanity has figured out
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:15.440]  a large portion of the Trojan horses. Yeah, we've been able to figure out
[2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:19.880]  a decent amount of information about who we are, where we are and what this place is,
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:24.560]  but it's really just a small fraction of the reality. What is this? We're in space and
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:29.360]  they got TVs watching us and the elite want to kill us. What the hell's going on? It's
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:34.280]  a spiritual war. It was foretold in the Bible, which is why they're trying to demonize Christians
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:38.800]  and Christianity, which is another thing that which is an emergency transmission. I mean,
[2:28:38.800 --> 2:28:43.040]  that is a literal transmission warning us. We got the transmission. We better follow
[2:28:43.040 --> 2:28:47.280]  it. Well, Bible also predicts that in the end times that what is considered good will
[2:28:47.280 --> 2:28:52.320]  be considered evil and what is evil is considered good. And I don't think that that's more properly
[2:28:52.320 --> 2:28:56.600]  illustrated than in today's society where on mainstream media, we have people calling
[2:28:56.600 --> 2:29:03.320]  for the assassination of police officers. We're demonizing the police where we're demonizing
[2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:09.280]  Christians. We're promoting these people who believe that they're not a male or a woman,
[2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:16.000]  but there's some new kind of. And so we have to give up our our identity for them. Yeah,
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:20.960]  the truth is considered to be hate speech now. And unfortunately now with everybody relying
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:27.120]  on social media and being beholden to those terms of service, there's not much recourse
[2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:31.160]  people could do when they shut you down, which is why we just need to keep on going and not
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:35.000]  be silenced and illustrate every attempt. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about the
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:38.880]  state of the republic, the state of the world and how we fight back with mark dies really
[2:29:38.880 --> 2:29:43.520]  smart cookie to quote Trump straight ahead info wars dot com. It's censored. It's under
[2:29:43.520 --> 2:29:47.120]  attack. And I'm not complaining. I'm saying this is an epic battle. We're in the center
[2:29:47.120 --> 2:29:51.520]  of it. Please pray for us. I'm praying for you. We're on the march. The empire's on
[2:29:51.520 --> 2:30:02.160]  the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Last week info wars dot com published the
[2:30:02.160 --> 2:30:06.680]  article bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children.
[2:30:06.680 --> 2:30:10.960]  The two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:16.320]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschool children, 39% who were not vaccinated. When
[2:30:16.320 --> 2:30:21.720]  asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies while only 6.9%
[2:30:21.720 --> 2:30:27.480]  were unvaccinated autism 4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated. So of course there's
[2:30:27.480 --> 2:30:31.160]  going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that vaccines are not really
[2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:34.360]  safe and people are going to come out and attack it and say, Oh, they just talked to
[2:30:34.360 --> 2:30:38.360]  parents or they'll say, Oh, there was a bias in the study. These people think vaccines
[2:30:38.360 --> 2:30:42.680]  are unsafe. One, the study proves they're unsafe and two, any other vaccine study is
[2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:47.320]  done and paid for by the pharmaceutical companies. Of course they think vaccines are safe. Just
[2:30:47.320 --> 2:30:51.240]  go to our article bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier. We have
[2:30:51.240 --> 2:30:54.920]  archive links to the studies and you can see for yourself because drug companies will
[2:30:54.920 --> 2:30:58.400]  do anything to keep you from the truth. Rob, you're reporting for info wars dot com and

[2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:49.920]  capability to make the world's first bionic man. Steve Austin will be that man better
[2:33:49.920 --> 2:34:08.360]  than he was before. Better, stronger, faster. Put out in the 1970s is already a reality.
[2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:14.520]  Now declassified cybernetic humans, dogs, cats, you name it, 1960. And it cost about
[2:34:14.520 --> 2:34:22.680]  $6 million. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:31.520]  lines of the info war. We live in the year 2017. The elite or at least a 2050. The singularity
[2:34:31.520 --> 2:34:38.240]  is already close. That's why they act like we don't even exist. Confidence really shows
[2:34:38.240 --> 2:34:44.560]  where they're at. Mark Dice has written about that as John Connor under the pen name. It's
[2:34:44.560 --> 2:34:48.680]  funny to see the Democrats saying, if you're watching this transmission, you're the resistance.
[2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:54.520]  It shows how weak they are. That's why we're under such attack is because we're over the
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:59.320]  target. We are on target. Not only news tonight, seven o'clock. I'm going to take more calls
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:03.400]  today. We'll do it tomorrow. But Mark, we don't pre script these interviews. You've
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:07.800]  been a busy guy hard to get on lately. But talking about the state of the world right
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:15.400]  now and where we are and what the globalist want to build. I see so many awake people
[2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:21.640]  that I also see a lot of the public are like zombies, as you call them. And we don't feel
[2:35:21.640 --> 2:35:26.440]  powerful if they're like zombies. We feel upset. The elite love the zombie osis. Where
[2:35:26.440 --> 2:35:34.440]  would you say in a football game? Team humanity, team enlightenment, team empowerment is versus
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:41.280]  team technocracy, team enslavement, team psychopath. You know, we just scored a big touchdown with
[2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:46.120]  the victory of President Trump and with the resurgence of conservatism amongst the millennials
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:51.920]  and even perhaps amongst Generation Z now getting politically inclined. And so it's
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:57.240]  really hard to say, but they are in overtime. So it's not the time for us to celebrate and
[2:35:57.240 --> 2:36:01.880]  to fall asleep at the wheel because they're just continuing to go forward with their agenda.
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:05.880]  We've got to stay in the zone. We've been tracking. It's great that, you know, people
[2:36:05.880 --> 2:36:10.520]  like you've been tracking this for a long time, but you can see patterns. And now it's
[2:36:10.520 --> 2:36:14.360]  just becoming clear what it is that they're doing. And we see their end game plan and
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:19.520]  we can't let them get there because if they do, we're going to have a Chinese level styled
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:24.520]  censorship of a Google, which we probably have to some degree already. They've already
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:29.080]  admitted that they are quote, redirecting search results. The Federal Trade Commission
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:34.160]  has investigated them and admitted that they manipulate the search results. Facebook has
[2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:40.520]  been caught multiple times manipulating the news feeds of hundreds of thousands of people
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:41.520]  in order to gauge.
[2:36:41.520 --> 2:36:47.360]  They just banned tens of thousands of accounts ahead of elections in the UK.
[2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:51.560]  Not just that, but multiple times they've been caught and admitted that they've conducted
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:57.480]  experiments manipulating what people see on their news feeds or in their status updates
[2:36:57.480 --> 2:37:02.640]  feeds to determine how that shapes their opinion. They've done experiments to try to get out
[2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:03.640]  the vote even.
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:08.160]  They've done experiments, as you said a year ago, it's now come out. They had sort, they're
[2:37:08.160 --> 2:37:13.320]  preying on millennials, preying on weak-minded people to keep them depressed.
[2:37:13.320 --> 2:37:17.200]  And so those are just the cases that we know of. So we know that they're doing this. We
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:23.040]  know what they're trying to do with these experiments. So you can reasonably extrapolate
[2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:28.040]  from that an array of other experiments that they've done that we haven't caught them with.
[2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:36.760]  And so this new, all internet technology news cycle, 24-7, it's not even a 24-7 news cycle,
[2:37:36.760 --> 2:37:40.680]  it's really just a 15 minutes. Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame is really a 15 minute news
[2:37:40.680 --> 2:37:47.000]  cycle because of the story that would have caused outrage and stuck in the news cycle
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  for perhaps a week.
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:51.200]  That's right. We thought having all this openness would defeat them, but it's almost just become
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:54.080]  conditioned. Our greatest strength is our greatest weakness. Let me ask you a selfish
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:57.680]  question. You've got a degree in this, but you've also proven you're a smart guy and
[2:37:57.680 --> 2:38:01.480]  have a different, you know, perspective. Why have they picked me the last few months as
[2:38:01.480 --> 2:38:07.320]  just the full on assault has actually gotten us more viewers, more listeners, but I get
[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:10.920]  for our own audience, that doesn't matter. They're in a general audience demonizing an
[2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:14.400]  archetype. What do you think that full assault's about?
[2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:19.000]  Well, it's vicious because they realize that you're independent. You're not beholden
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:24.080]  to advertisers like Fox News. You have your own platform. You're on YouTube, but you're
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:29.400]  on hundreds of radio stations. As your loyal viewers know, they were hitting you just far
[2:38:29.400 --> 2:38:35.840]  below the belt. I mean, far beyond just ordinary criticism, far beyond just attacking, really
[2:38:35.840 --> 2:38:40.200]  just unconscionable attacks against you and your family, which is completely despicable
[2:38:40.200 --> 2:38:44.720]  and crosses the line. And when Hillary Clinton mentioned you by name, I mean, I think we
[2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:46.720]  all kind of knew that you were the target.
[2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:50.440]  Yeah, you called me. You said, get ready. That was a green light.
[2:38:50.440 --> 2:38:55.080]  We all kind of knew that that's, that's not put you on the map. Put a target on your back
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:59.440]  because they can ignore you. And I'm quite surprised at this point, they're still kind
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:04.280]  of ignoring me. I see articles of attacking, you know, kind of smaller YouTube channels.
[2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:08.720]  Well, they do that because you're scared, Mark. You're informed, you're slick. You come
[2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:13.080]  off much better than their Polish writers with 20, 30 writers. Let's just say it's true.
[2:39:13.080 --> 2:39:17.120]  You're scared of you. I think they are. And they don't want to, they don't know what to
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:19.520]  do because they know if they attack me, they're just going to give me more attention. So they're
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:23.520]  kind of going after some smaller people, but with you, you just, you got too big to ignore
[2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:30.480]  anymore. And so when Stephen Colbert is doing entire segments, three, four days a week about
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:36.160]  you, I mean, you know that all, all the guns are pointed on you. And so it's great that
[2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:41.200]  you have an independent platform and what they're trying to do to really engulf the
[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:46.640]  entire, you know, media stream, the information stream is to get everybody to rely on Facebook
[2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:52.320]  and on Twitter. Facebook is having no, I agree. So what is the attack? It wasn't just a message.
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:55.920]  Don't do this or we'll do this to you, but it doesn't really do anything to you. It's
[2:39:55.920 --> 2:40:00.040]  like, I think they're just trying to scare people away from being patriots. What do you
[2:40:00.040 --> 2:40:04.160]  think this full assaults about? No, I don't think they know what to do. They're panicking
[2:40:04.160 --> 2:40:09.040]  because they see someone like you rising up, having more viewers, you know, in an hour
[2:40:09.040 --> 2:40:15.080]  or more than most of these shows will get in an entire day. The MTV news YouTube channel
[2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:20.760]  can barely get 20,000 views on a single video. Yeah. They're trying to promote this as if
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:22.600]  this is the premier, you know,
[2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:26.520]  So they're discredited. They're hated. All the polls show it. What did they do next then?
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:30.880]  I mean, what does all this signify in a warfare model for you then, Mark? You've been banned
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:34.280]  off Google. You've been banned off YouTube. You've been at your websites blog. You've
[2:40:34.280 --> 2:40:39.200]  already been through that fail made you bigger. That's what I see. Like if they fail shutting
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:42.320]  me down, what does that do? I mean, it's just crazy.
[2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:47.000]  You know, they're going after you so hard. I mean, on your Wikipedia page, it calls
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:54.160]  in for a quote, fake news website on my Wikipedia page. Alex, they refuse the editors refused
[2:40:54.160 --> 2:41:00.560]  to call me a media critic or a media analyst. Get this, despite links to the Washington
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:06.720]  Times, Fox News and other outlets, the BBC, very well respected news outlets calling me
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:11.040]  a media analyst and a media critic. You agree on it. You've hosted national TV shows. You've
[2:41:11.040 --> 2:41:15.360]  got best selling books. You've been around for 15, 17 years, but they just dehumanize
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:19.880]  you. They call me a conspiracy theory. So I started tweeting about it finally. So get
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:25.280]  this, Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, we started chatting through DMs on Twitter.
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:29.920]  Okay. And he was gracious enough. I don't know if this is because he liked some of my
[2:41:29.920 --> 2:41:34.800]  work or if he just kind of wanted this to go away, wanted me to quiet down. The founder
[2:41:34.800 --> 2:41:39.760]  of Wikipedia, a board sitting on the board of directors went himself. And you can see
[2:41:39.760 --> 2:41:43.720]  this in the edit logs that he did this. This isn't some secret that I'm, you know, throwing
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:50.160]  them out of the bus for doing. He edited my page himself and added that I am a media analyst.
[2:41:50.160 --> 2:41:54.880]  Sighted these citations because you need, you know, sources. So he sourced the Washington
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:42:00.240]  Times, all these other outlets that I mentioned, the other editors overruled him, reverted
[2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:04.920]  it back to conspiracy theorists. And then in the talk page said that those just are
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:12.520]  quote, very poor sources. Okay. So the founder of the site isn't even allowed to cite me
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:13.520]  as a media analyst.
[2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:18.240]  What shows this social justice warrior, anti-free speech attitude?
[2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:22.280]  It's insane. And so I haven't got around to making a video about it. But all I'm going
[2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:25.600]  to do is just make a video about it. And then a million people are going to see that. Now
[2:42:25.600 --> 2:42:29.240]  your audience is sure. So don't they just make themselves says, where does this go?
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:36.320]  They're making themselves illegitimate by doing this. They might as well just give up
[2:42:36.320 --> 2:42:40.560]  and have some reasonable arguments like, like we did, you know, in previous. Why don't they
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:46.000]  just argue with us instead of ban us because they can't know. And they've positioned themselves
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:50.920]  as if they are the liberals of the moral authority. And so, you know, I have a lot of people,
[2:42:50.920 --> 2:42:54.920]  a lot of liberals will tweet to me and say, well, the First Amendment doesn't protect,
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:42:58.840]  you know, you from being banned on social media for violating their terms of service.
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:43:02.240]  Well, we just want fairness. You know, we don't want this double standard.
[2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:06.280]  Yeah, you're saying kill Trump and promoting radical Islam. And then we just can't say,
[2:43:06.280 --> 2:43:08.080]  don't cut women's genitals off.
[2:43:08.080 --> 2:43:13.240]  And at the same time, they're suing businesses if they won't do special products for certain
[2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:18.800]  segments of the population. If a photographer won't go and take photos of a gay wedding,
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:22.800]  they want them sued, they want them out of business. Well, those same people, I guarantee
[2:43:22.800 --> 2:43:26.640]  you, if you were to go to a baker, if some Nazis were to go to a baker and want some
[2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:30.320]  swastikas put on a cake, I guarantee you that the baker's not going to do it.
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:33.560]  Exactly. Let me ask you, where does all this bullying go? Because I don't want to call
[2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:39.160]  them betas, but it seems like open free society, modern world, all the alphas were like, Hey,
[2:43:39.160 --> 2:43:43.040]  let's be nice here, buddy. Let's put betas in charge. Now betas want to be aggressive
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:48.360]  alphas. So they're now aggressing against alphas. Where does this go?
[2:43:48.360 --> 2:43:53.320]  You know, they're really causing people to get more polarized, to get more angry, to
[2:43:53.320 --> 2:43:59.120]  get possibly even more extreme, because reasonable people are seeing this, these unreasonable
[2:43:59.120 --> 2:44:04.160]  arguments and they're getting upset at being treated unfairly. So I just hope that we can
[2:44:04.160 --> 2:44:09.800]  still counter them by reasonable arguments, by demonstrating and showing and proving how
[2:44:09.800 --> 2:44:10.800]  this is an example.
[2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:15.120]  I'm interrupting you. I've never been a butt kisser of the police. I don't like government
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:18.920]  programs that are unconstitutional, bad cops. I call them out. I wrote books about it. Everybody
[2:44:18.920 --> 2:44:23.560]  knows that, but I don't hate cops in average. That's the lowest level of municipal government.
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:28.840]  That's our issue. There's a problem. We should fix it. I come out and say, like you do, look,
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:32.880]  this guy says randomly kill cops, more cops get killed. They go, Oh, you're a butt kisser
[2:44:32.880 --> 2:44:37.600]  of the establishment. No, I don't randomly pull up at a gas station and see a cop and
[2:44:37.600 --> 2:44:41.640]  shoot them in the back. Don't even know their name, who their kids are. Did the cop attack
[2:44:41.640 --> 2:44:45.880]  me? Did he come after me? I'll sue him or whatever. The point is they have to do something
[2:44:45.880 --> 2:44:50.600]  innocent until proven guilty. You just can't as a class say, kill the cops like George
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:54.640]  Soros has been doing. And then they call us butt kissers. No, we're not. We don't want
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:57.680]  to kill people that haven't done something.
[2:44:57.680 --> 2:45:01.960]  You know, you were one of the ones on the forefront when smartphones started to become
[2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:06.200]  popular with video cameras. And there was a big problem of police officers arresting
[2:45:06.200 --> 2:45:10.800]  people and threatening people and even attacking citizens for recording them. And you were
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:15.720]  one of the first people to start alerting about this. And so thankfully there were, you know,
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:20.760]  there were memos sent to all police stations finally saying, no, this isn't a wiretap there.
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:24.200]  They can do this. Don't, you know, because it was so new because before the smartphones
[2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:27.880]  had that technology in it, it was very rare to somebody for somebody to just have a video
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:32.320]  camera, you know, walking around and videotape something. But now as more and more people
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:35.960]  had those in their pocket, the police officers didn't know how to deal with that. They were
[2:45:35.960 --> 2:45:40.840]  abusing their power, trying to stop people from videotaping them. And so you were one
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:45.240]  of the people that was on the front lines of trying to, you know, alert and persuade
[2:45:45.240 --> 2:45:51.040]  the police departments to stop abusing their authority by false arrest and by assaulting
[2:45:51.040 --> 2:45:53.880]  citizens. So it's just insane how.
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:59.000]  Exactly. I'm against cops being bad and I'm against randomly killing cops. And they go,
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:02.280]  oh, you're not being reasonable. Hate the cops or love them. How about just treat them
[2:46:02.280 --> 2:46:04.960]  like normal people?
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:08.600]  One more thing about Wikipedia, of course, they'll just allow any random garbage on your
[2:46:08.600 --> 2:46:13.760]  page or, you know, they refuse to call me what I actually am. They refuse to have my
[2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:18.640]  YouTube stats. For a while, somebody put on there that, oh, Mark runs the YouTube channel.
[2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:25.000]  It's got 900,000 subscribers. And every, you know, popular quote, YouTuber has on their
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:27.720]  page how many stats that they're with their stats.
[2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:30.400]  Sure, but they don't want to show that you're almost a million subscribers.
[2:46:30.400 --> 2:46:36.400]  Exactly. And so they, they remove that. And so just a few double standards again from them.
[2:46:36.400 --> 2:46:42.560]  The Wikipedia people will not allow large controversy sections on liberal pages. Meanwhile,
[2:46:42.560 --> 2:46:49.320]  if you go to your page or encultures page, the controversies page or criticism, it's
[2:46:49.320 --> 2:46:55.440]  like 25% of the craziest thing is they'll randomly claim some employee says that I have, you
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:47:00.600]  know, flying pigs in my office. No proof. It's just made up insane crap. They would never
[2:47:00.600 --> 2:47:03.000]  link to that with somebody else.
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:07.400]  They won't even mention, at least the last I checked last week, they won't even mention
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:12.720]  on Lawrence O'Donnell's page. He's an MSNBC host. And he mentioned of his conspiracy theories
[2:47:12.720 --> 2:47:19.400]  about supposedly he probably covered this. He thought that the Syrian chemical attack
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:25.760]  was orchestrated by Putin in order to bait Trump into a response, all that in order to
[2:47:25.760 --> 2:47:34.320]  have the American media distracted and don't play your video. No proof. No, no common sense.
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:38.320]  No motive. And then he just isn't.
[2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:43.880]  That is the definition of a conspiracy theory. And there is no mention of that on his Wikipedia
[2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:47.960]  page. At least there wasn't last week when I checked when I was putting together a story
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:54.080]  on this. So they won't allow legitimate criticism. And that was reported even in the Washington
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:59.200]  Post, which is run by the psycho Jeff Bezos, who, you know, wants to go into space and
[2:47:59.200 --> 2:48:04.680]  have AI take over. So even the Washington Post, probably the far left, leftist, most
[2:48:04.680 --> 2:48:09.960]  liberal newspaper, not website, obviously. But as far as print papers,
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:17.240]  Sure. So since you mentioned Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, we've known for decades, the globalist
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:20.640]  believe they're going to merge the machines, become these gods. They believe that's what
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:25.000]  they believe. So the Bible says they believe thousands of years ago. Don't they get those
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:29.600]  transcend all this if they believe in humanity, instead of believing we're all done and it's
[2:48:29.600 --> 2:48:34.480]  over. I mean, it's just crazy. Al Gore's new movies coming out, you know, claiming that
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:39.000]  we're all going to die if we don't pay him carbon taxes in your gut. Where do you think
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:42.400]  the next few years is going, Mark Dice?
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:47.720]  It's going to be crazy. We may see the birth of almost human and level intelligence AI.
[2:48:47.720 --> 2:48:52.960]  They're trying to create AI to monitor all live streams on Facebook and YouTube and to
[2:48:52.960 --> 2:49:00.040]  monitor all uploads to determine whether they're already putting AI in charge of censoring
[2:49:00.040 --> 2:49:05.000]  us. So robots are already not judges, not Jerry's robots.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:09.400]  Now as great as the technology is, it, you shouldn't rely on it because it, it fails
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:14.200]  at the most, you know, unexpected times. I mean, when the argument that it's independent,
[2:49:14.200 --> 2:49:17.200]  they program it for how they want.
[2:49:17.200 --> 2:49:22.200]  It's so complicated. Nobody knows the algorithms. And so those who are controlling the algorithm,
[2:49:22.200 --> 2:49:26.600]  at least until the AI possibly controls the algorithm, controls it all.
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:31.360]  Yeah. Now maybe five years ago when the iPhone was becoming pretty popular, when the time
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:35.760]  changed, all of us, a lot of people use obviously their phones for their alarms. It's it has
[2:49:35.760 --> 2:49:39.680]  replaced the alarm clocks. And so when the time changed at the, you know, during daylight
[2:49:39.680 --> 2:49:45.520]  savings time, millions of people's alarms were an hour off because the clocks now, as
[2:49:45.520 --> 2:49:49.280]  you know, automatically change, you know, you have to go and manually change your clock,
[2:49:49.280 --> 2:49:53.440]  your table box automatically changes. So we're relying on this technology to tell us what
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:56.440]  it, what time it is, to tell us what to do, tell us what to think.
[2:49:56.440 --> 2:50:01.760]  So there was a glitch in the system where the alarm clock still was, was based off of
[2:50:01.760 --> 2:50:07.000]  the previous time. So everybody's alarms were an hour off. Okay. So, and then this shows
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:11.120]  how we're totally dependent on this to make the decisions. Pretty soon as a robot helped
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:12.120]  me breathe.
[2:50:12.120 --> 2:50:17.440]  Oh, it gets better. It gets better. So I was, I was a victim of this. I woke up and I thought,
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:20.320]  wait a minute, I thought I had my alarm set. What the heck is going on? So I, when I got
[2:50:20.320 --> 2:50:24.440]  to work later that day, I checked the blogs and sure enough, major glitch, you know, on
[2:50:24.440 --> 2:50:28.960]  Apple causes millions of people's alarms to go up. It's even better. So it was like four
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:33.600]  months later, five months later when the time changes back, it happened again. They didn't
[2:50:33.600 --> 2:50:36.240]  fix it to go the reverse way, Alex.
[2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:41.520]  So it shows how the elites are turning everything over to AI and then they're giving control
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:47.240]  up themselves. The ultimate control freaks are giving up control to their silicon God.
[2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:51.080]  And I've talked to a lot of engineers. They don't even know how stuff works now or how
[2:50:51.080 --> 2:50:55.920]  chips get made. It's like computers are already doing it for like five years and no one knows.
[2:50:55.920 --> 2:51:00.000]  They're already captured by AI. Is it already conscious?

[2:54:39.640 --> 2:54:42.720]  sparking fears of 1984's Donald's censorship.
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:45.800]  Digitized books altered original sources destroyed
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:47.440]  just like 1984.
[2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:51.720]  But it's all done with a liberal coding
[2:54:51.720 --> 2:54:54.640]  and establishment Republican packaging.
[2:54:54.640 --> 2:54:56.120]  I'm gonna finish up with Mark Dyson,

[2:55:39.680 --> 2:55:40.760]  And I wanna thank all the listeners
[2:55:40.760 --> 2:55:42.160]  for helping build this organization
[2:55:42.160 --> 2:55:43.560]  and what we've done so far.
[2:55:44.520 --> 2:55:46.660]  I wanna grow in the face of this.
[2:55:46.660 --> 2:55:48.840]  I wanna in the next six months to a year
[2:55:48.840 --> 2:55:53.360]  have like 16, 18, 20 hours a day of live radio slash TV
[2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:55.160]  because there's so many great minds,
[2:55:55.160 --> 2:55:57.600]  so many great people that I wanna get on air
[2:55:57.600 --> 2:55:58.800]  to really reach people.
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:02.040]  I wanna roll over to this anti-human force.
[2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:05.320]  I take it personally, so infoorstore.com.
[2:56:05.320 --> 2:56:07.600]  Mark Dice, we were getting into a lot of points.
[2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:09.720]  I've asked a lot of questions here today,
[2:56:09.720 --> 2:56:11.360]  but in the last three, four months we have,
[2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:13.480]  what are other issues or other topics
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:14.920]  you wanna impart to people?
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:17.600]  No, newer is not always better.
[2:56:17.600 --> 2:56:21.360]  We see that in society we tend to come up with new
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:23.560]  and synthetic ways of doing things.
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:26.460]  And then oftentimes we later discover
[2:56:26.460 --> 2:56:29.360]  that those only create more problems like the food.
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:30.640]  They create the GMO foods.
[2:56:30.640 --> 2:56:34.800]  It creates these cheap, sometimes delicious tasting foods,
[2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:36.680]  unfortunately, it just ends up harming you.
[2:56:36.680 --> 2:56:40.920]  And then people go back to then the original organic.
[2:56:40.920 --> 2:56:44.920]  And so we're seeing a backlash now against e-books.
[2:56:44.920 --> 2:56:48.160]  For the first time, paperback books or P-books
[2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:50.240]  or physical books, as they're being called,
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:53.400]  are getting more popular because people are realizing
[2:56:53.400 --> 2:56:55.120]  the dangers of e-books.
[2:56:55.120 --> 2:56:57.600]  They don't like to just have to hold their tablet.
[2:56:57.600 --> 2:56:59.920]  People like to write in a book and forward it.
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:02.640]  The moonlight messes your brain up.
[2:57:02.640 --> 2:57:03.480]  Yeah, they like to.
[2:57:03.480 --> 2:57:04.880]  And you don't physically hold it, exactly.
[2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:06.880]  We need to get back to organic.
[2:57:06.880 --> 2:57:09.320]  If I drop a book, I mean, nothing's gonna happen.
[2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:10.720]  But if you're sitting on your patio
[2:57:10.720 --> 2:57:12.920]  and you happen to drop your iPad, well, guess what?
[2:57:12.920 --> 2:57:14.040]  There's $500.
[2:57:14.040 --> 2:57:16.080]  And they're going in, like you said, I just read it.
[2:57:16.080 --> 2:57:18.800]  You're editing the famous books.
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:22.040]  Look at Bill and I, the science guy cut chromosomes,
[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:24.240]  men and women out, we didn't know.
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:27.160]  I had, one of my books was removed
[2:57:27.160 --> 2:57:29.080]  from the Apple iBooks store
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:31.320]  because they were auto-scanning it.
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:34.160]  And it happened to mention in my book,
[2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:37.200]  like at the very end, hey, if you like this book,
[2:57:37.200 --> 2:57:38.160]  check out my other ones.
[2:57:38.160 --> 2:57:39.800]  You can get them on Amazon.com
[2:57:39.800 --> 2:57:42.120]  or download them from any of the e-book stores.
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:45.040]  They said that I violated their terms of service
[2:57:45.040 --> 2:57:48.640]  because I was promoting a competitor's store.
[2:57:48.640 --> 2:57:49.760]  So, you know.
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:53.840]  You've got AI robots censoring your speech saying, support me.
[2:57:54.920 --> 2:57:57.640]  Yeah, just mentioning another competitor's store.
[2:57:57.640 --> 2:57:59.640]  I mean, that would be,
[2:57:59.640 --> 2:58:02.960]  we may get into a digital book burning phase here
[2:58:02.960 --> 2:58:06.040]  where these isolated incidents could go full blown
[2:58:06.040 --> 2:58:08.680]  or Amazon could start removing certain books
[2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:10.800]  or just decide not to carry books.
[2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:13.320]  Well, remember when they banned a 1984 for a while?
[2:58:14.880 --> 2:58:17.560]  Or now, they, they overwhelmingly deleted it, yeah,
[2:58:17.560 --> 2:58:21.040]  from Kindle because somebody who uploaded it
[2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:23.200]  to the digital store didn't have the rights.
[2:58:23.200 --> 2:58:24.960]  And so a lot of people went and bought the book
[2:58:24.960 --> 2:58:26.680]  and not knowing, you know, I mean,
[2:58:26.680 --> 2:58:28.560]  publishers, different publishers have the rights.
[2:58:28.560 --> 2:58:30.400]  So the bottom line is, be conscious,
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:32.920]  make decisions, change the world, we have the power,
[2:58:32.920 --> 2:58:34.680]  not the globalist if we choose to have it.
[2:58:34.680 --> 2:58:36.720]  Mark Dice Amazing, markdice.com.

[3:00:34.200 --> 3:00:38.080]  All Watson's about to take over.
[3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:41.240]  You know they don't want us to be romantics, they don't want us to actually care about
[3:00:41.240 --> 3:00:48.160]  ourselves, our family, anybody else, but I gotta tell you, we've changed the world together
[3:00:48.160 --> 3:00:52.680]  and we're changing the world now more than ever and that's why we're under attack.
[3:00:52.680 --> 3:01:01.000]  This is the great animating contest of liberty and you look at the servile minions that serve
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:05.120]  this global system, thank God we're not with those Tim and Soltz.
[3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:09.080]  Doesn't mean I have all the answers, doesn't mean I'm on some pedestal, some high horse,
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:23.240]  but I fundamentally see a couple thugs going after some woman, mugging some woman.
[3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:30.800]  I feel like some tough guy, but it's like water flowing down hill, I'm gonna go over
[3:01:30.800 --> 3:01:35.600]  there and I'm gonna beat the living crap out of them, that's not talk, it's what we've
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:38.640]  done with the politicians, what we've done with the globalists, it's not talk, it's
[3:01:38.640 --> 3:01:42.640]  real, it's not me being a tough guy, the guys talk tough all day, they never do anything,
[3:01:42.640 --> 3:01:46.200]  they ain't gonna show up when you need them, but I'm sure to tell you, I don't like thugs,
[3:01:46.200 --> 3:01:50.880]  I don't like scum and I believe in you, I know you're good, I know your heart's just
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:56.120]  like mine and I wanna stomp globalist guts all over the map, you know I'm Paul Watson,
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:02:00.480]  hired Paul Watson 15 years ago, saw his website, saw the great work he was doing, I saw a
[3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:04.200]  beautiful soul right there, I knew that's the leader, we're gonna get him hired, we're
[3:02:04.200 --> 3:02:07.920]  gonna empower him and we're gonna push him out of the nest and make him be a leader
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:11.520]  and now he's done it and I'm telling you, I know we're talking to millions and millions
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:16.040]  of people right now and I'm telling you, there's tens of thousands of youth leaders,
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:21.560]  all of you can take action, we're all leaders in one way or the other, so I wanna invite
[3:02:21.560 --> 3:02:25.760]  you to be part of the animating contest of liberty and to realize when you support us,
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:29.240]  when you spread the links, when you spread the articles, it is an act of defiance against
[3:02:29.240 --> 3:02:35.280]  globalist scumbags, I think they're better than you and your family.
[3:02:35.280 --> 3:02:40.000]  I can't just roll over to these people and just turn my will over to them when they're
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:49.240]  against the human system, they tell me they've evolved though they've devolved, I have transcended.
[3:02:49.240 --> 3:02:53.240]  Don't wave your finger at me Zuckerberg or Schmidt or any of you and tell me how I'm
[3:02:53.240 --> 3:02:58.000]  falling because I don't see your mission, I know your mission better than you and I'll
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:05.560]  have no part of it, I'll have no part of BLC Bob and his damn system.
[3:03:05.560 --> 3:03:11.680]  The devil didn't build this, we did because we made the image of God, not you fallen failure.
[3:03:11.680 --> 3:03:16.120]  Paul Watson, take over my great friend, tell us what's coming up in the next hour.
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:21.440]  Hi Alex, yeah we got Cassandra Fairbanks coming up at the bottom of the hour to talk about
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:26.680]  what happened with her being demonized as a white supremacist last week for doing the
[3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:32.040]  old case, I know a White House press briefing, she also broke a big news article about Buzzfeed
[3:03:32.040 --> 3:03:36.520]  in relation to their employees, joking about the assassination of Donald Trump.
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:40.120]  And then you broke a big deal with Buzzfeed when on a fake story.
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:44.880]  Yeah, and that's what we've broken today which is the massive story and this is interesting
[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:48.920]  Alex because you know, as I acknowledge in the article, people who do this for years
[3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:53.600]  and years, if you're writing two, three articles a day, you will occasionally get things wrong,
[3:03:53.600 --> 3:03:57.680]  you will get trolled, that happened to us, it happened to me specifically probably like
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:03:58.680]  four months ago.
[3:03:58.680 --> 3:04:00.200]  But Buzzfeed lies on purpose.
[3:04:00.200 --> 3:04:01.200]  Yeah.
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:06.800]  But Buzzfeed reveled in that Alex, they absolutely loved it, oh my God, Info Wars trolled by
[3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:10.720]  a fake news story, they absolutely cherished that.
[3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:15.880]  Well now Alex, the shoe is on the other foot because Buzzfeed has been completely trolled,
[3:04:15.880 --> 3:04:19.160]  they published fake news, but it gets worse than that.
[3:04:19.160 --> 3:04:22.840]  They didn't retract the story, they didn't even delete the story.
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:27.760]  They changed the headline and the entire article and made it look as if they never got trolled
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:28.760]  in the first place.
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:30.640]  To show how much they disdain their listeners.
[3:04:30.640 --> 3:04:31.640]  Their viewers.
[3:04:31.640 --> 3:04:32.640]  Exactly.
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:37.920]  Yeah, so we're going to expose it and we're going to talk more about their dishonest
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:40.600]  behavior in response to this story and why not.
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:47.640]  Well Buzzfeed is the name, it is the standard of well quite frankly mentally ill fallen
[3:04:47.640 --> 3:04:51.000]  twisted dwarfs that are in this factory of lies.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:55.880]  Paul Watson straight ahead in the uncensored human resistance against the technotronic
[3:04:55.880 --> 3:04:56.880]  takeover.
[3:04:56.880 --> 3:05:00.200]  Stay with us and spread the word.
[3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:04.520]  Last week Info Wars.com published the article, bombshell study proves unvaccinated children
[3:05:04.520 --> 3:05:06.440]  are healthier than vaccinated children.
[3:05:06.440 --> 3:05:10.720]  The two studies were pulled from the Journal of Transitional Science without any explanation.
[3:05:10.720 --> 3:05:16.080]  The studies surveyed parents of 666 homeschooled children, 39% who were not vaccinated.
[3:05:16.080 --> 3:05:20.040]  When asked about allergies, 22% of vaccinated children were shown to have allergies while
[3:05:20.040 --> 3:05:26.720]  only 6.9% were unvaccinated autism 4.7% were vaccinated versus 1% unvaccinated.
[3:05:26.720 --> 3:05:29.780]  So of course there's going to be pushback when a study like this comes out proving that
[3:05:29.780 --> 3:05:33.480]  vaccines are not really safe and people are going to come out and attack it and say, Oh,
[3:05:33.480 --> 3:05:37.040]  they just talked to parents or they'll say, Oh, there was a bias in the study.
[3:05:37.040 --> 3:05:39.080]  These people think vaccines are unsafe.
[3:05:39.080 --> 3:05:43.120]  One the study proves they're unsafe and to any other vaccine study is done and paid
[3:05:43.120 --> 3:05:45.080]  for by the pharmaceutical companies.
[3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:47.040]  Of course they think vaccines are safe.
[3:05:47.040 --> 3:05:50.720]  Let's go to our article bombshell study proves unvaccinated children are healthier.
[3:05:50.720 --> 3:05:54.560]  We have archive links to the studies and you can see for yourself because drug companies
[3:05:54.560 --> 3:05:56.560]  will do anything to keep you from the truth.
[3:05:56.560 --> 3:06:00.080]  Rob Dew reporting for info wars.com and info wars nightly news.
[3:06:00.080 --> 3:06:05.080]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[3:06:05.080 --> 3:06:08.400]  before it became lost to our modern diet of processed junk.

[3:06:19.840 --> 3:06:22.200]  great tasting formula caveman.
[3:06:22.200 --> 3:06:26.200]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[3:06:26.200 --> 3:06:27.200]  superior ancestors.
[3:06:27.200 --> 3:06:32.240]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that everyone knew that you used all the parts
[3:06:32.240 --> 3:06:33.240]  of the animal.
[3:06:33.240 --> 3:06:37.880]  You use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength
[3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:42.320]  from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[3:06:42.320 --> 3:06:43.400]  the blood for the body.
[3:06:43.400 --> 3:06:45.960]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[3:06:45.960 --> 3:06:50.320]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as they'll try to get back
[3:06:50.320 --> 3:06:53.960]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[3:06:53.960 --> 3:06:57.760]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and for
[3:06:57.760 --> 3:06:59.400]  worse life.com today.

[3:08:23.800 --> 3:08:28.000]  Live on this May 9th edition, it is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:32.600]  At the bottom of the hour, we have Cassandra Fairbanks coming on of bigleaguepolitics.com.
[3:08:32.600 --> 3:08:38.000]  Of course, she broke the big story last week about BuzzFeed employees joking about the
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:40.320]  assassination of Donald Trump.
[3:08:40.320 --> 3:08:45.840]  BuzzFeed came out after and said, how dare you imply that this suggests any bias whatsoever.
[3:08:45.840 --> 3:08:46.840]  I mean, the temerity.
[3:08:46.840 --> 3:08:52.080]  They said, oh, this is BuzzFeed employees, where BuzzFeed news, this has no reflection
[3:08:52.080 --> 3:08:55.360]  on our bias on our agenda.
[3:08:55.360 --> 3:08:56.360]  Absolutely ludicrous.
[3:08:56.360 --> 3:08:59.520]  But okay, let's talk about BuzzFeed news, shall we?
[3:08:59.520 --> 3:09:02.240]  Because they've got caught today putting out fake news.
[3:09:02.240 --> 3:09:07.400]  In fact, it was out for four days before the people responsible for the troll contacted
[3:09:07.400 --> 3:09:08.400]  info wars.
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:13.480]  And again, to set the table, everybody who writes news articles for years and years,
[3:09:13.480 --> 3:09:16.200]  maybe two, three a day, we occasionally make mistakes.
[3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:17.200]  We get trolled.
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:19.520]  I've made a couple of mistakes in the past.
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:24.120]  Again, I put it in the article, hands up, made a mistake about four months ago when
[3:09:24.120 --> 3:09:28.840]  I got trolled with a fake news story differences.
[3:09:28.840 --> 3:09:31.560]  There are consequences when we make a mistake.
[3:09:31.560 --> 3:09:33.560]  No consequences for BuzzFeed.
[3:09:33.560 --> 3:09:36.120]  They don't even publish a retraction.
[3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:38.920]  They don't get accused of fake news.
[3:09:38.920 --> 3:09:40.800]  They don't get put on lists.
[3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:45.120]  They don't get people calling for Facebook to censor them Twitter to censor them.
[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:47.920]  They don't get snow fact checked.
[3:09:47.920 --> 3:09:48.920]  But we do.
[3:09:48.920 --> 3:09:53.120]  They don't get little tags on Facebook where you can flag things for fake news.
[3:09:53.120 --> 3:09:58.480]  CNN doesn't, of course, because the same rules don't apply to them.
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:00.160]  They can put out fake news.
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:06.840]  They can refuse to retract and get away with it with virtually no consequences whatsoever.
[3:10:06.840 --> 3:10:08.480]  This is why this is a big story.
[3:10:08.480 --> 3:10:10.400]  It needs to get out there.
[3:10:10.400 --> 3:10:14.600]  The headline is BuzzFeed tricks into publishing fake news story.
[3:10:14.600 --> 3:10:17.240]  So you had a bunch of conservative trolls.
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:22.720]  Basically, it's an online comedy group pretending to be transgender women.
[3:10:22.720 --> 3:10:26.520]  So born male pretending to be female transgender.
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:32.960]  They approached a video game tournament and tried to enter as transgender.
[3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:35.800]  The tournament was women only.
[3:10:35.800 --> 3:10:41.440]  Now they planned this from the very beginning weeks in advance specifically to try to troll
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:48.960]  BuzzFeed and bait them, fool them, trick them into writing a story based on fake news.
[3:10:48.960 --> 3:10:49.960]  They're not transgender.
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:52.520]  They're a conservative troll group.
[3:10:52.520 --> 3:11:00.080]  And from the very outset, they did it purely to troll BuzzFeed and BuzzFeed took the bait.
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:06.360]  Again, proving that they have a bias because the bait tied in directly to their social
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:13.200]  justice, gender hysteria narrative, they failed to do basic fact checking.
[3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:18.600]  This comedy group gave them the name of their own troll group.
[3:11:18.600 --> 3:11:24.200]  They could have done one single Google search and found out that this group had a goofy
[3:11:24.200 --> 3:11:29.760]  website, had a YouTube channel in which they make fun out of Hillary Clinton voters and
[3:11:29.760 --> 3:11:32.440]  make comedic videos.
[3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:33.600]  It was an obvious troll.
[3:11:33.600 --> 3:11:37.680]  It was an obvious conservative group baiting BuzzFeed.
[3:11:37.680 --> 3:11:40.720]  They failed to do basic due diligence.
[3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:46.000]  Again, these are the same people who will point fingers at us all day and call us fake
[3:11:46.000 --> 3:11:47.120]  news.
[3:11:47.120 --> 3:11:48.600]  Say that we should be censored.
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:52.880]  Say that there should be consequences for us that we should be put on a blacklist.
[3:11:52.880 --> 3:11:56.840]  When they get caught doing the exact same thing, what happens?
[3:11:56.840 --> 3:11:57.840]  Nothing.
[3:11:57.840 --> 3:12:04.120]  They put out the Trump pgate dossier months and months ago, completely debunked, completely
[3:12:04.120 --> 3:12:10.360]  fraudulent, completely fabricated the details anyway, and again, no consequences whatsoever.
[3:12:10.360 --> 3:12:16.080]  You don't get calls for BuzzFeed to be fact checked by Snopes, do you?
[3:12:16.080 --> 3:12:19.760]  Even though Snopes is a completely bias left-wing news outlet itself.
[3:12:19.760 --> 3:12:23.960]  Oh, they're going to do the fact checking because they're neutral.
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:24.960]  They're not bias at all.
[3:12:24.960 --> 3:12:25.960]  They don't have an agenda.
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:27.960]  They're right.
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:28.960]  Absolute BS.
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:33.160]  They don't get put on blacklists, which get published by the Washington Post, again,
[3:12:33.160 --> 3:12:37.800]  based on completely bizarre, obscure groups that just dream them up out of thin air.
[3:12:37.800 --> 3:12:39.200]  Oh, and what a coincidence.
[3:12:39.200 --> 3:12:42.800]  It's daily caller, bright bought, gateway pundit, info wars.
[3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:44.960]  Oh, it's all conservative news sites.
[3:12:44.960 --> 3:12:47.600]  Isn't that a coincidence?
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:53.120]  Could it be that you're just putting your ideological adversaries on a blacklist so people don't
[3:12:53.120 --> 3:12:54.760]  read their content?
[3:12:54.760 --> 3:13:00.760]  Could it be that we're not actually fake news, we just have a different opinion?
[3:13:00.760 --> 3:13:06.360]  Fake news, and there are fake news websites, they didn't have an impact on the US election
[3:13:06.360 --> 3:13:12.080]  as a Stanford University study proved, but the mainstream media never talks about that.
[3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:18.640]  But there are fake news websites that put out deliberate fake news, knowing it's fake,
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:21.320]  simply to get advertising clicks to make money.
[3:13:21.320 --> 3:13:26.920]  Okay, there's a difference between that and having a different opinion.
[3:13:26.920 --> 3:13:30.440]  There's a difference between that and making a mistake and publishing something that's
[3:13:30.440 --> 3:13:35.040]  fake and then withdrawing it later, which we have done and will continue to do in the
[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:39.880]  future if it's a mistake and which Buzzfeed has done.
[3:13:39.880 --> 3:13:43.400]  But again, the consequences are never the same.
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:48.360]  So they've changed this article in which they were completely baited by this troll group
[3:13:48.360 --> 3:13:54.920]  into thinking that they were a bunch of transgender gamers facing discrimination.
[3:13:54.920 --> 3:13:56.800]  They changed the article entirely.
[3:13:56.800 --> 3:14:02.440]  They changed the headline to bury the fact that they got trolled, that they got tricked
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:05.720]  and baited in the first place.
[3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:11.360]  Even though this electronic sports league, which rejected their application to join the
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:17.360]  tournament because they were transgender, not born women, even though the electronic sports
[3:14:17.360 --> 3:14:24.760]  league told Buzzfeed that pranksters were trying to enter as transgenders as a joke,
[3:14:24.760 --> 3:14:25.760]  as a troll.
[3:14:25.760 --> 3:14:30.480]  So they actually warned Buzzfeed that people were doing this and Buzzfeed just went along
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:34.280]  with the story anyway, again, because it fit into their narrative.
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:41.240]  ESL's director of communications, Anna Roswanowicz, even told Buzzfeed that there had, and this
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:46.760]  is a quote, there had been multiple incidents of male players trying to enter female tournaments
[3:14:46.760 --> 3:14:49.680]  as a joke.
[3:14:49.680 --> 3:14:56.080]  They directly told Buzzfeed that this is what was happening, but Buzzfeed failed to realize
[3:14:56.080 --> 3:15:02.000]  that that's exactly the stunt that this conservative troll group was pulling before publishing
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:04.760]  the fake story.
[3:15:04.760 --> 3:15:10.920]  So again, they were denying transgender applicants to, quote, prevent trolls because people were
[3:15:10.920 --> 3:15:13.080]  doing this over and over again.
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:17.400]  So they told Buzzfeed, watch out, there are a bunch of trolls pulling tricks trying to
[3:15:17.400 --> 3:15:18.400]  apply for this.
[3:15:18.400 --> 3:15:25.280]  They're not really transgender women or whatever, but again, Buzzfeed fell for it completely.
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:32.640]  They failed to Google the term rigatoni family, which is the name of this online comedy group,
[3:15:32.640 --> 3:15:37.400]  to find out that they had a goofy website, that they had a YouTube channel, which again
[3:15:37.400 --> 3:15:40.160]  includes a video of making fun of Hillary Clinton.
[3:15:40.160 --> 3:15:44.200]  It's obviously not a transgender liberal leftist group.
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:51.800]  It's a conservative troll group, and one single Google search would have found that out.
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:52.800]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:55.240]  And they were not the only ones to fall for it.
[3:15:55.240 --> 3:15:56.240]  Mashable.
[3:15:56.240 --> 3:16:01.080]  Oh, Mashable had a good laugh when we got a story wrong a few months ago, didn't they?
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:05.880]  Well, again, the shoes on the other foot, isn't it Mashable, because you fell for this completely.
[3:16:05.880 --> 3:16:08.880]  Are you going to miss your retraction?
[3:16:08.880 --> 3:16:10.840]  Let's have a look right now.
[3:16:10.840 --> 3:16:14.720]  Yes, they've changed the headline in the entire story.
[3:16:14.720 --> 3:16:16.480]  They haven't issued a retraction.
[3:16:16.480 --> 3:16:17.840]  They just changed the story.
[3:16:17.840 --> 3:16:22.720]  It would be better if they just deleted the original story, held their hands up and said,
[3:16:22.720 --> 3:16:24.080]  okay, we were wrong.
[3:16:24.080 --> 3:16:29.120]  But they try and manipulate it by changing the original story in the hope that people
[3:16:29.120 --> 3:16:32.240]  don't find out that they were trolled, they were tricked in the first place.
[3:16:32.240 --> 3:16:37.720]  So Mashable fell for it, Buzzfeed fell for it, Kotaku also fell for it, which is again
[3:16:37.720 --> 3:16:45.000]  a social justice warrior pandering website, which again was instrumental in fabricating
[3:16:45.000 --> 3:16:50.320]  the whole Gamergate narrative, claiming it was about harassment when it was about people
[3:16:50.320 --> 3:16:56.040]  sick to the back teeth of having this social justice hysteria injected into absolutely
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:16:57.540]  everything.
[3:16:57.540 --> 3:17:02.800]  Now it's starting to ruin movies, they're trying to inject it into game design, claiming
[3:17:02.800 --> 3:17:05.560]  that games are sexist.
[3:17:05.560 --> 3:17:10.960]  Even though that's one of the most diverse communities in the world, no one was complaining.
[3:17:10.960 --> 3:17:16.400]  Then Anita Sarkeesian comes along and suddenly it's quite a lucrative industry to complain
[3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:18.680]  about sexism in video games.
[3:17:18.680 --> 3:17:24.320]  So then the whole narrative began and Kotaku has been instrumental in pushing that phony
[3:17:24.320 --> 3:17:25.480]  narrative.
[3:17:25.480 --> 3:17:31.560]  They fell for this again, because it fit their preconceived narrative, their preconceived
[3:17:31.560 --> 3:17:35.920]  bias about transgender people being discriminated against.
[3:17:35.920 --> 3:17:41.760]  So they just went with the story with zero checking whatsoever.
[3:17:41.760 --> 3:17:44.320]  So it's not nice when the shoe is on the other foot, is it?
[3:17:44.320 --> 3:17:50.120]  But again, we get things wrong, there are consequences, no consequences for Buzzfeed,
[3:17:50.120 --> 3:17:54.680]  no consequences for Mashable, no consequences for Kotaku.
[3:17:54.680 --> 3:17:57.960]  I mean, what happened to the Pigate dossier?
[3:17:57.960 --> 3:18:03.440]  Only Buzzfeed should have all of their URLs pre-checked before they're allowed to be posted
[3:18:03.440 --> 3:18:04.440]  on Facebook.
[3:18:04.440 --> 3:18:09.240]  Of course, that's tongue-in-cheek, we're not going to call for Buzzfeed to be censored.
[3:18:09.240 --> 3:18:13.400]  I don't want Buzzfeed to be censored, I don't want Buzzfeed to be wiped off the internet,
[3:18:13.400 --> 3:18:16.200]  I don't want Buzzfeed to be put on a list.
[3:18:16.200 --> 3:18:23.000]  We have a healthy exchange of ideas in the marketplace of ideas, that's how it works.
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:24.200]  Who resonates most?
[3:18:24.200 --> 3:18:27.160]  Who's more truthful with their information?
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:28.680]  Who rises and falls?
[3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:32.800]  You can't just put people on a blacklist and censor them because you disagree with their
[3:18:32.800 --> 3:18:34.800]  opinion.
[3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:40.680]  This fake news controversy has been exploited and now it's blown up in their face.
[3:18:40.680 --> 3:18:44.840]  Remember, this is the same group Buzzfeed last week.
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:49.400]  Their employees were caught in private chats, coincidentally on the same day they came out
[3:18:49.400 --> 3:18:55.320]  with that big hit piece against Infowars, caught in private chats joking about the assassination
[3:18:55.320 --> 3:19:01.120]  of Donald Trump, even wishing it tongue-in-cheek to happen.
[3:19:01.120 --> 3:19:05.240]  So then Buzzfeed News comes out and says, oh, that's Buzzfeed, that's a completely different
[3:19:05.240 --> 3:19:06.600]  group of people.
[3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:13.400]  How dare you suggest that Buzzfeed, this far-left organization that consistently comes out with
[3:19:13.400 --> 3:19:20.520]  this social justice leftist hysteria, how dare you even allege that we might be partisan,
[3:19:20.520 --> 3:19:22.200]  that we might have a bias?
[3:19:22.200 --> 3:19:28.440]  Well, they can't pull that excuse this time because it's Buzzfeed News that got trolled
[3:19:28.440 --> 3:19:30.680]  and baited by this fake story.
[3:19:30.680 --> 3:19:35.880]  They fell for it, they came out afterwards, changed the headline, changed the story, didn't
[3:19:35.880 --> 3:19:38.560]  actually issue a proper retraction.
[3:19:38.560 --> 3:19:44.320]  So again, the impression left is that, oh, it was just blame the trolls, blame the trolls,
[3:19:44.320 --> 3:19:45.320]  it's all their fault.
[3:19:45.320 --> 3:19:50.080]  No, it's your fault, you got baited, you reveled in it when it happened to us.
[3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:53.320]  So how's it feel for the shoe to be on the other foot?
[3:19:53.320 --> 3:19:54.320]  Not very nice, is it, Buzzfeed?
[3:19:54.320 --> 3:20:23.160]  We'll be back with the next segment of the Alex Jones Show Live in 4Wars.com.
[3:20:23.160 --> 3:20:53.000]  We'll be back with the next segment of the Alex Jones Show Live in 4Wars.

[3:31:59.480 --> 3:32:03.120]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[3:32:03.120 --> 3:32:05.400]  in stock at m4store.com.
[3:32:05.400 --> 3:32:07.200]  Research across the board is clear.
[3:32:07.200 --> 3:32:11.160]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[3:32:11.160 --> 3:32:12.160]  clots and heart attacks.
[3:32:12.160 --> 3:32:17.160]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[3:32:17.160 --> 3:32:19.920]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[3:32:19.920 --> 3:32:24.360]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[3:32:24.360 --> 3:32:27.040]  iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[3:32:27.040 --> 3:32:31.560]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out
[3:32:31.560 --> 3:32:34.080]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[3:32:34.080 --> 3:32:38.720]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[3:32:38.720 --> 3:32:43.640]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver and more, due to requests from listeners who found that
[3:32:43.640 --> 3:32:46.120]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[3:32:46.120 --> 3:32:50.120]  We have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.
[3:32:50.120 --> 3:32:55.200]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at m4worthlife.com

[3:16:38.140 --> 3:33:32.200]  thanks for having me.
[3:33:32.200 --> 3:33:47.600]  I was talking about it earlier, I just want to get your take on this.
[3:33:47.600 --> 3:34:04.960]  Once again, trolled into putting out fake news, they again accuse us of fake news, they
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:10.520]  point fingers at us on a daily basis, they get caught putting out fake news, I explained
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:13.240]  it before the break, I'll give a brief overview again.
[3:34:13.240 --> 3:34:19.720]  Your fake transgender gaming team enters a competition, a gaming competition for women
[3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:25.320]  only, they claim their transgender, they get discriminated against apparently, they then
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:30.720]  complain to Buzzfeed, Buzzfeed doesn't even entertain for a second that they might be
[3:34:30.720 --> 3:34:36.160]  being trolled, despite the fact they just had to do a simple Google search of the name
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:40.880]  of this group, so they publish the article, they get trolled, this group had been planning
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:47.280]  to troll them for weeks, it worked, but again, Cassandra, there are no consequences for Buzzfeed,
[3:34:47.280 --> 3:34:50.720]  we get something wrong and it happens from time to time, they point the finger, they
[3:34:50.720 --> 3:34:55.320]  say your fake news, you should be put on a blacklist, your content should be censored
[3:34:55.320 --> 3:35:01.000]  on social media, they literally put out fake news over and over again, no consequences for
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:03.360]  Buzzfeed, quite ironic isn't it?
[3:35:03.360 --> 3:35:09.800]  It is, they are definitely extremely biased and I feel like they just don't fact check
[3:35:09.800 --> 3:35:17.040]  anything, they just want whatever will create outrage, get clicks and yet they're the ones
[3:35:17.040 --> 3:35:20.600]  always throwing stones at us.
[3:35:20.600 --> 3:35:25.240]  It's absolutely incredible and then they come out afterwards, change the headline of the
[3:35:25.240 --> 3:35:29.520]  story, change the article, it would have been better if they deleted it, so they try and
[3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:34.960]  switch it, the whole thing round, as if they never got trolled, put the blame on the trolls,
[3:35:34.960 --> 3:35:40.120]  not them who have been conned into publishing it in the first place, absolutely incredible
[3:35:40.120 --> 3:35:45.920]  but again, they will point the finger at info wars, they will revel all day long if we get
[3:35:45.920 --> 3:35:51.080]  something wrong, when it happens to them, oh, let's just shush shush about that and quietly
[3:35:51.080 --> 3:35:55.320]  hope it goes away, they've been caught putting out fake news once again, but I want to talk
[3:35:55.320 --> 3:36:00.800]  to you about your big article for big league politics last week, you broke a big story
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:04.200]  about Buzzfeed, tell us about that.
[3:36:04.200 --> 3:36:12.000]  Well, one of the editors appeared on Tucker Carlson, so a former employee Tim Treadstone
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:18.760]  or Baked Alaska as most people know him, got frustrated, he basically called Tim a liar
[3:36:18.760 --> 3:36:25.320]  on Tucker Carlson, so Tim hit me up and gave me a whole bunch of screenshots from the workplace
[3:36:25.320 --> 3:36:31.640]  slack of Buzzfeed and it's just the employees laughing about Trump being assassinated and
[3:36:31.640 --> 3:36:39.800]  how they were kind of hopeful that would happen, so it was pretty bad, sorry, my dog is trying
[3:36:39.800 --> 3:36:40.800]  to get up.
[3:36:40.800 --> 3:36:44.600]  It was interesting because they came out after and said, oh, this isn't Buzzfeed news, this
[3:36:44.600 --> 3:36:50.920]  is just Buzzfeed, how dare you suggest that Buzzfeed news could have any kind of bias,
[3:36:50.920 --> 3:36:56.880]  because we all know that Buzzfeed is a centrist neutral outlet, right Cassandra, you could
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:36:59.720]  never accuse them of having any bias, right?
[3:36:59.720 --> 3:37:06.200]  Right, one of them contacted me and he was like, this is basically like, if you went
[3:37:06.200 --> 3:37:11.920]  after ABC for something that somebody at Disney said, and I was like, not quite, like, you
[3:37:11.920 --> 3:37:14.960]  guys are all Buzzfeed, it's Buzzfeed.
[3:37:14.960 --> 3:37:20.680]  Well, I mean, that's the point, they can't do it this time with this new fake news story
[3:37:20.680 --> 3:37:26.520]  because Buzzfeed news put it out, which again proves that they have that bias, right, because
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:32.760]  it fit into their preconceived narrative before about gender hysteria or whatever, social
[3:37:32.760 --> 3:37:38.720]  justice hysteria, so they were so keen to buy into it, they put out the fake story without
[3:37:38.720 --> 3:37:43.920]  accurately checking it, again proving they had that agenda, they have that bias, but
[3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:45.680]  I want to move on because we're short on time.
[3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:50.880]  A couple of weeks ago, you were in the White House press briefing room, which by the way,
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:56.040]  Jack Pasobix there today, and he's triggered basically all the verified liberals on Twitter
[3:37:56.040 --> 3:38:00.240]  simply by being present in that room, they're all having a massive panic attack right now
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:07.560]  like they did with you and Cernovich being there, but you threw up an OK sign for a photograph,
[3:38:07.560 --> 3:38:09.040]  tell us what happened next.
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:14.200]  Well, I mean, when we took that photo, there was like nobody in the press briefing, like
[3:38:14.200 --> 3:38:18.800]  there was nobody in the room, we figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal, people might
[3:38:18.800 --> 3:38:24.640]  be like a little upset that we were there, but I wasn't expecting to be called a white
[3:38:24.640 --> 3:38:30.280]  supremacist in an article that got shared 40,000 times, they basically, there was a
[3:38:30.280 --> 3:38:37.680]  meme going around, pretty much just mocking the hysteria, and it showed like the OK symbol
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:43.280]  and they wrote the letters W and P over it saying that it was, you know, the symbol for
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:48.040]  white power.
[3:38:48.040 --> 3:38:52.840]  So without contacting me, without reaching out to anyone who actually was in the photo
[3:38:52.840 --> 3:38:58.640]  or in any of the photos like this, they published a story saying that I'm a white supremacist,
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:03.120]  that I'm a member of the alt-right, and it was a very...
[3:39:03.120 --> 3:39:07.920]  And this was based on a tweet originally because it was the independent that wrote the article,
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:08.920]  this was based...
[3:39:08.920 --> 3:39:12.120]  Who sent out the original tweet accusing you of being a white supremacist?
[3:39:12.120 --> 3:39:18.360]  It was a reporter, a senior reporter from Fusion named Emma Roller, who we're actually
[3:39:18.360 --> 3:39:22.440]  drafting the complaint to file a lawsuit against right now.
[3:39:22.440 --> 3:39:25.880]  And she didn't retract or apologize at any point, correct?
[3:39:25.880 --> 3:39:31.880]  No, I mean, she got the most retweets she's probably ever gotten on anything, so she wasn't
[3:39:31.880 --> 3:39:33.440]  about to back down.
[3:39:33.440 --> 3:39:37.440]  It's more about the narrative than the truth with a lot of these people.
[3:39:37.440 --> 3:39:44.280]  And then in their article, the independent said that the ADL had said that the OK symbol
[3:39:44.280 --> 3:39:47.360]  was a symbol of white supremacy of racism.
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:49.880]  You link through to the actual ADL website.
[3:39:49.880 --> 3:39:51.240]  They said nothing of the kind.
[3:39:51.240 --> 3:39:56.160]  It was a completely different thing using two hands than the ADL came out afterwards
[3:39:56.160 --> 3:40:02.160]  and had to clarify that doing the A-O-K hand sign doesn't mean you're a white supremacist.
[3:40:02.160 --> 3:40:04.920]  But again, it was in the original independent article.
[3:40:04.920 --> 3:40:08.480]  I thought it was funny because they actually debunked themselves.
[3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:13.220]  They claimed that it was a white supremacist symbol and linked to the ADL, which said the
[3:40:13.220 --> 3:40:14.720]  exact opposite, correct?
[3:40:14.720 --> 3:40:15.720]  Yeah.
[3:40:15.720 --> 3:40:16.720]  It was amazing.
[3:40:16.720 --> 3:40:19.280]  I was looking at it and I was like, do they not have editors?
[3:40:19.280 --> 3:40:27.360]  Even at much, much smaller outlets I've worked for, my stories have to go through two editors.
[3:40:27.360 --> 3:40:33.240]  They would have caught that and been like, hey, Cassandra, what are you talking about?
[3:40:33.240 --> 3:40:38.480]  Eventually it took them several days to even update the article after the ADL came out
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:44.200]  and they put out another article a few days ago saying that it's not actually a white
[3:40:44.200 --> 3:40:45.960]  power symbol.
[3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:50.080]  But that article, of course, is not going to get shared as many times as the one that
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:52.200]  called me a white supremacist.
[3:40:52.200 --> 3:40:54.200]  No, exactly.
[3:40:54.200 --> 3:40:58.840]  They often put out a retraction on page 25 or whatever.
[3:40:58.840 --> 3:41:00.240]  That's just how they roll.
[3:41:00.240 --> 3:41:05.840]  But again, I had people on Twitter days after this because I made a video about it claiming
[3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:10.960]  that no media ever accused you of being a white supremacist and that if they did, they
[3:41:10.960 --> 3:41:11.960]  weren't left-wing.
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:17.560]  The Independent is literally left of the Guardian in Britain when it existed in physical form,
[3:41:17.560 --> 3:41:19.680]  which it doesn't really at this point.
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:22.920]  But again, I think the answer to what you were talking about there, they just don't
[3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:27.840]  check anything because if it's the same with other British newspapers, which I've seen,
[3:41:27.840 --> 3:41:34.480]  they basically fired the actual journalists to cut costs and hired 21-year-old SJWs fresh
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:37.240]  out of college to write a lot of their content.
[3:41:37.240 --> 3:41:42.560]  The Independent have attacked me on a regular basis while begging for an interview via email,
[3:41:42.560 --> 3:41:43.840]  which I'm not going to give them.
[3:41:43.840 --> 3:41:46.720]  So again, it seems to be very sloppy over there.
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:51.520]  But again, it's just interesting how the original woman who sent out that tweet, the
[3:41:51.520 --> 3:41:58.120]  Fusion reporter, didn't even retract it after it was so clear that they had got this completely
[3:41:58.120 --> 3:41:59.120]  wrong.
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:02.880]  Again, it shows they point the finger at us and themselves, they get caught in these
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:07.880]  things they don't back down, but we're the ones who are fake news, we need to be censored.
[3:42:07.880 --> 3:42:08.880]  Yep.
[3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:13.880]  It's all right, I'm losing you, I can't hear anything.
[3:42:13.880 --> 3:42:17.200]  All right, that's okay, we're into you.
[3:42:17.200 --> 3:42:18.200]  They just don't care.
[3:42:18.200 --> 3:42:23.440]  I want to talk about your political ideology again, because you started off somewhat on
[3:42:23.440 --> 3:42:30.800]  the left and I get a lot of messages from people who are former leftists, former SJWs.
[3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:34.080]  It's fair to say that you were more leftist than what you are now, it's probably a bit
[3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:38.960]  mean to say you were a social justice warrior, but you moved in some of those circles.
[3:42:38.960 --> 3:42:43.640]  Up until a couple of years ago, you were distinctly more leftist.
[3:42:43.640 --> 3:42:48.960]  My question is, was there one particular incident or story that changed your political compass?
[3:42:48.960 --> 3:42:54.040]  Maybe someone who had a personal influence on you, or was it just a kind of gradual realization?
[3:42:54.040 --> 3:43:00.960]  I mean, it was kind of gradual, like there was a lot of things happening, like the chockening,
[3:43:00.960 --> 3:43:07.160]  watching people call the police over people writing Trump 2016 in chalk, and being like
[3:43:07.160 --> 3:43:10.880]  this is, we've reached like peak insanity.
[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:16.960]  And so after that happened, I started following people like you, Milo, just the people who
[3:43:16.960 --> 3:43:22.440]  were as offensive as possible, because free speech is just so important to me.
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:26.640]  So yeah, I was following like a lot of like Milo's crowd and things like that.
[3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:30.360]  And then, oh my God, my dog's coming, I'm sorry.
[3:43:30.360 --> 3:43:33.280]  That sounds like quite an extremist dog there.
[3:43:33.280 --> 3:43:37.280]  No, I just wanted to ask, because you know, you've seen it from both sides.
[3:43:37.280 --> 3:43:41.480]  You've seen, I guess you moved in circles of left wing extremists, you've been accused
[3:43:41.480 --> 3:43:46.520]  of being a right wing extremist, what would you say there's a difference between the two
[3:43:46.520 --> 3:43:51.440]  in terms of, you know, the people on the fringes of the left, of the fringes of the right?
[3:43:51.440 --> 3:43:54.800]  We acknowledge that there are, you know, violent right wing extremists.
[3:43:54.800 --> 3:44:00.320]  I think the difference is that the left kind of legitimizes their fringe extremists.
[3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:02.520]  They don't disavow them, they don't call them out.
[3:44:02.520 --> 3:44:07.200]  Have you seen a difference between the two in terms of left wing extremists and right
[3:44:07.200 --> 3:44:11.640]  wing extremists, given that you kind of moved in some of their circles back a few years
[3:44:11.640 --> 3:44:12.640]  ago?
[3:44:12.640 --> 3:44:13.640]  Absolutely.
[3:44:13.640 --> 3:44:17.480]  Oh my God, I'm so sorry about my dog.
[3:44:17.480 --> 3:44:24.400]  Yeah, yeah, on the left, people, the more extreme they are, the cooler they are almost.
[3:44:24.400 --> 3:44:30.120]  On the right, you see people like Richard Spencer going band from coming to event.
[3:44:30.120 --> 3:44:31.120]  People training.
[3:44:31.120 --> 3:44:36.640]  All right, that's all right, I'll take over for now Cassandra, you deal with the dog.
[3:44:36.640 --> 3:44:38.960]  We'll try and get back to it in the next segment.
[3:44:38.960 --> 3:44:43.680]  This is the Alex Jones show live, Cassandra is going to go and deal with her yapping dog
[3:44:43.680 --> 3:44:48.000]  there in the background and we'll try and get her back on the line.
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:53.840]  Big story up on info wars.com right now, French election fraud, we're asking the question
[3:44:53.840 --> 3:44:57.520]  images show ruined and stolen Le Pen ballots.
[3:44:57.520 --> 3:45:02.280]  Now this is interesting because of course we had the story before the first round where
[3:45:02.280 --> 3:45:10.520]  500,000 overseas French people received two ballots, they received duplicate ballots.
[3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:14.640]  Of course, most of the expats, most of the French people living overseas were likely
[3:45:14.640 --> 3:45:16.680]  to vote for Macron.
[3:45:16.680 --> 3:45:21.000]  The police came out and said, oh, this isn't really an issue, we might investigate it after
[3:45:21.000 --> 3:45:22.960]  the election, we'll wait and see.
[3:45:22.960 --> 3:45:25.360]  Nothing was done at the time.
[3:45:25.360 --> 3:45:31.440]  Now this info wars.com story shows this video where this Arab individual Arab looking individual
[3:45:31.440 --> 3:45:38.240]  goes into a polling station in Paris, Northeast Paris, appears to take a bunch of Marine Le
[3:45:38.240 --> 3:45:45.440]  Pen ballot slips off a table, how he was allowed to, God only knows, talks into the camera
[3:45:45.440 --> 3:45:50.360]  and then the next scene is they're all discarded on the street, Marine Le Pen ballots while
[3:45:50.360 --> 3:45:55.320]  him and his friend scream and chant F the national front.
[3:45:55.320 --> 3:45:57.800]  Why is this not being investigated?
[3:45:57.800 --> 3:46:02.280]  Now if it's some harmless stunt, which seems pretty unlikely given that he looks like he's
[3:46:02.280 --> 3:46:06.920]  taking ballot papers out of a polling station, which should never be allowed.
[3:46:06.920 --> 3:46:11.160]  If it is a harmless stunt, if it's a prank, then people need to come out and call it for
[3:46:11.160 --> 3:46:12.280]  what it is.
[3:46:12.280 --> 3:46:14.160]  So we need an explanation on that.
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:19.720]  We also need an explanation on the picture below that, which is in the same article,
[3:46:19.720 --> 3:46:25.280]  which shows a household of five Le Pen voters received their ballots in the post.
[3:46:25.280 --> 3:46:31.360]  And as you can see in the image there, they were all torn, they were all ruined.
[3:46:31.360 --> 3:46:36.200]  Now the description that went along with that kind of exaggerated it said that 60% of Le
[3:46:36.200 --> 3:46:39.160]  Pen ballots were destroyed at the time of mailing.
[3:46:39.160 --> 3:46:40.280]  There's no evidence for that.
[3:46:40.280 --> 3:46:46.120]  That seems like an exaggeration, but these are legitimate questions about possible French
[3:46:46.120 --> 3:46:47.120]  election fraud.
[3:46:47.120 --> 3:46:53.600]  It probably wouldn't have swayed the outcome, but when you do have 500,000 people receiving
[3:46:53.600 --> 3:46:58.280]  duplicate ballots before the first round, Marine Le Pen comes second.
[3:46:58.280 --> 3:46:59.960]  She doesn't get first place.
[3:46:59.960 --> 3:47:02.880]  She doesn't get that momentum going forward.
[3:47:02.880 --> 3:47:06.600]  No questions need to be asked about these latest examples.
[3:47:06.600 --> 3:47:12.520]  Why is this individual taking ballot papers out of a polling station, throwing them on
[3:47:12.520 --> 3:47:16.920]  the road, then chanting F, the national front?
[3:47:16.920 --> 3:47:21.400]  That needs to be investigated again, if it is just a prank, then we need to know about
[3:47:21.400 --> 3:47:22.400]  it.
[3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:25.760]  But absolutely insane behavior in the article there.
[3:47:25.760 --> 3:47:31.720]  There you see how Le Pen actually came third, record number of spoiled ballots and abstentions.
[3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:37.760]  There was about 25% either spoiled ballots or abstentions in the vote.
[3:47:37.760 --> 3:47:41.880]  So again, none of this, as far as I know, is being investigated.
[3:47:41.880 --> 3:47:44.400]  It needs to be investigated.
[3:47:44.400 --> 3:47:49.000]  Okay, we've got Cassandra back on the line.
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:51.600]  She's managed to get rid of the dog for the time being.
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:52.600]  Cassandra, welcome back.
[3:47:52.600 --> 3:47:54.840]  I'm so sorry about that.
[3:47:54.840 --> 3:47:59.240]  I'm a really young puppy and there were children banging on my door.
[3:47:59.240 --> 3:48:00.240]  Sorry.
[3:48:00.240 --> 3:48:02.040]  That's all right, these things happen.
[3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:05.920]  I was just finishing up with the question.
[3:48:05.920 --> 3:48:07.560]  You moved in these circles.
[3:48:07.560 --> 3:48:12.040]  We have extremism on the left, extremism on the right.
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:15.520]  You've moved in these Antifa circles, you weren't a member of Antifa, obviously.
[3:48:15.520 --> 3:48:19.320]  Then they threatened you later on, they in fact threatened your children, I remember.
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:22.720]  So you've had a taste of that extremism on both sides.
[3:48:22.720 --> 3:48:25.520]  How would you say the two compare?
[3:48:25.520 --> 3:48:33.080]  Well, there's definitely, I haven't personally seen any violence from people on the right.
[3:48:33.080 --> 3:48:39.360]  When I left the left, it was kind of like leaving a cult and I was getting threats.
[3:48:39.360 --> 3:48:41.520]  I got cornered at the RNC twice.
[3:48:41.520 --> 3:48:48.360]  I got spit on by people who were yelling my name at the inauguration here in DC.
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:51.280]  I've never seen anything like that from the right.
[3:48:51.280 --> 3:48:59.200]  I mean, there's people who definitely say a lot worse things or it can get pretty bad.
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:03.200]  But most people on the right disavow that immediately.
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:09.120]  On the left, you have people calling for cops to be killed, for Trump supporters to be killed.
[3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:15.720]  Those people are celebrated or they're given jobs at places like BuzzFeed.
[3:49:15.720 --> 3:49:21.240]  There's definitely a big difference in both how people act and how the rest of the scene
[3:49:21.240 --> 3:49:23.720]  kind of interacts with those people.
[3:49:23.720 --> 3:49:26.480]  I mean, I've found a similar thing.
[3:49:26.480 --> 3:49:28.720]  The left never polices their crazies.
[3:49:28.720 --> 3:49:30.320]  That's what it always seems like.
[3:49:30.320 --> 3:49:32.400]  They almost embrace them in some instances.
[3:49:32.400 --> 3:49:37.080]  The guy who confronted Trump physically on stage about a year ago, he was given a platform
[3:49:37.080 --> 3:49:38.960]  the next day by CNN.
[3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:40.760]  That would never happen.
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:44.800]  Fox News would never have somebody on who tried to physically confront Hillary Clinton.
[3:49:44.800 --> 3:49:45.800]  It just wouldn't happen.
[3:49:45.800 --> 3:49:47.600]  Cassandra, we've got about a minute left.
[3:49:47.600 --> 3:49:50.040]  Tell us about big league politics.
[3:49:50.040 --> 3:49:51.040]  Where's that going?
[3:49:51.040 --> 3:49:52.040]  It's going to be an adventure.
[3:49:52.040 --> 3:49:53.040]  Right?
[3:49:53.040 --> 3:49:54.040]  Yes.
[3:49:54.040 --> 3:49:55.040]  It's very, very exciting.
[3:49:55.040 --> 3:49:56.040]  We have some great people.
[3:49:56.040 --> 3:49:57.960]  We have Patrick Howley from Breitbart.
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:05.280]  We have a lot of fantastic people that we'll be publishing more of in the next few days.
[3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:06.600]  Highly recommend checking it out.
[3:50:06.600 --> 3:50:09.520]  You can find it bigleagepolitics.com.
[3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:15.440]  And our Twitter is bigleagepolitics, I think, but it's spelled a little strange.
[3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:16.920]  Just search for it.
[3:50:16.920 --> 3:50:21.760]  Okay, and the Twitter for you is at Cassandra Rules.
[3:50:21.760 --> 3:50:23.760]  Cassandra, thanks for joining us today.
[3:50:23.760 --> 3:50:25.080]  Thank you for having me.
[3:50:25.080 --> 3:50:27.080]  I'm sorry about my dog.
[3:50:27.080 --> 3:50:28.080]  That's all right.
[3:50:28.080 --> 3:50:29.080]  No problem.
[3:50:29.080 --> 3:50:30.080]  There goes Cassandra.
[3:50:30.080 --> 3:50:34.600]  And her puppy will be sure to get her back up and on the air.
[3:50:34.600 --> 3:50:36.520]  Probably minus the puppy next time.
[3:50:36.520 --> 3:50:38.600]  We have one more segment of the fourth hour to go.
[3:50:38.600 --> 3:50:41.120]  We're going to get into some big breaking news.
[3:50:41.120 --> 3:50:46.520]  Now they're saying that you should expect foreigners to be late at university, at school,
[3:50:46.520 --> 3:50:48.560]  at jobs, because that's just how they behave.
[3:50:48.560 --> 3:50:50.880]  Again, this is the bigotry of low expectations.
[3:50:50.880 --> 3:50:56.240]  They have diversity training telling people they just need to expect that.
[3:50:56.240 --> 3:50:59.640]  All their racists will be back in the final segment of the Alex Jones Show in Four Wars
[3:50:59.640 --> 3:51:00.640]  dot com.
[3:51:00.640 --> 3:51:03.040]  Extendivite is more than just a heart tonic.
[3:51:03.040 --> 3:51:05.120]  Do you have any of these symptoms?
[3:51:05.120 --> 3:51:06.960]  Night cramps in the hands and feet.
[3:51:06.960 --> 3:51:09.120]  Your arms and legs often go to sleep.
[3:51:09.120 --> 3:51:11.800]  On short walks, do your legs get aches and pains?
[3:51:11.800 --> 3:51:14.160]  Is your memory worse than it used to be?
[3:51:14.160 --> 3:51:15.880]  Ankles that swell late in the day?
[3:51:15.880 --> 3:51:17.840]  Does your blood pressure increase lately?
[3:51:17.840 --> 3:51:23.640]  If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning signs of arterial
[3:51:23.640 --> 3:51:24.640]  blockages.
[3:51:24.640 --> 3:51:27.960]  Your body is saying that it is time to take Extendivite.
[3:51:27.960 --> 3:51:30.160]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[3:51:30.160 --> 3:51:33.560]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.
[3:51:33.560 --> 3:51:35.840]  Get your Extendivite today.
[3:51:35.840 --> 3:51:40.840]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two month supply.

[3:51:52.280 --> 3:52:00.360]  Extend your life with Extendivite.
[3:52:00.360 --> 3:52:01.680]  Let's go to Devin and Florida.
[3:52:01.680 --> 3:52:03.680]  Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[3:52:03.680 --> 3:52:04.680]  Great.
[3:52:04.680 --> 3:52:05.680]  Hey, thank you so much.
[3:52:05.680 --> 3:52:09.680]  Listen, I have bought your product and I got to say they're amazing.
[3:52:09.680 --> 3:52:10.680]  Thank you.
[3:52:10.680 --> 3:52:16.680]  I was on the fence by it because I've got cave-in, supermail vitality, secret swell,
[3:52:16.680 --> 3:52:18.180]  vitamin, and infusion.
[3:52:18.180 --> 3:52:19.680]  I've got the body armor.
[3:52:19.680 --> 3:52:20.680]  Wow, thank you.
[3:52:20.680 --> 3:52:21.680]  Wow.
[3:52:21.680 --> 3:52:22.680]  You're the type of lesser that makes it all possible.
[3:52:22.680 --> 3:52:24.680]  Which pharmaceutical does he like best?
[3:52:24.680 --> 3:52:28.240]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[3:52:28.240 --> 3:52:29.240]  That's amazing.
[3:52:29.240 --> 3:52:30.240]  That's really incredible.
[3:52:30.240 --> 3:52:33.760]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt
[3:52:33.760 --> 3:52:34.760]  sweet.
[3:52:34.760 --> 3:52:40.560]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the info, it's true and I just want
[3:52:40.560 --> 3:52:46.560]  to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[3:52:46.560 --> 3:52:47.560]  You will love it.
[3:52:47.560 --> 3:52:49.800]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

[3:53:03.600 --> 3:53:04.880]  talk radio.

[3:53:10.720 --> 3:53:11.720]  as you are.

[3:54:24.640 --> 3:54:27.960]  We're going to get back into a couple more news stories in a second, but again, I want
[3:54:27.960 --> 3:54:32.000]  to remind you about the great products at infowarslife.com.
[3:54:32.000 --> 3:54:36.800]  In ForWarsLife, BiomeDefense 50 probiotic is back in stock.
[3:54:36.800 --> 3:54:42.280]  It's the highly rated formula, loaded with a superior blend of over 50 billion live probiotic
[3:54:42.280 --> 3:54:44.920]  cultures from 23 different strains.
[3:54:44.920 --> 3:54:49.480]  It supports digestion and healthy intestinal function.
[3:54:49.480 --> 3:54:55.760]  Your gut is home to over 100 million neurons, brain neurotransmitters, and is often called
[3:54:55.760 --> 3:55:01.080]  your second brain because of the direct link between the brain and the digestive system.
[3:55:01.080 --> 3:55:03.200]  It's very much connected.
[3:55:03.200 --> 3:55:08.720]  BiomeDefense is produced in the USA, a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, and lab tested for
[3:55:08.720 --> 3:55:09.720]  quality.
[3:55:09.720 --> 3:55:13.200]  Read the five-star independent reviews at infowarslife.com.
[3:55:13.200 --> 3:55:16.920]  Again, we also have Survival Shield X2.
[3:55:16.920 --> 3:55:17.920]  That's about to sell out.
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:24.280]  We have the Caveman True Paleo formula, and we have the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[3:55:24.280 --> 3:55:31.640]  It's now back in stock for a limited time at a price of just $9.95, so that's 33% off
[3:55:31.640 --> 3:55:32.640]  retail.

[3:55:53.900 --> 3:55:56.720]  mugs are going to be coming out very shortly.
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:55:58.080]  You've seen the T-shirt.
[3:55:58.080 --> 3:55:59.640]  People are excited about that.
[3:55:59.640 --> 3:56:02.040]  It is the conservative.
[3:56:02.040 --> 3:56:07.720]  Conservatism is a new culture, and those liberal tears taste so good.
[3:56:07.720 --> 3:56:09.400]  That's the other one.
[3:56:09.400 --> 3:56:13.880]  High-quality mug, conservatism is the new culture.
[3:56:13.880 --> 3:56:17.840]  That will be available soon at infowarsstore.com here.
[3:56:17.840 --> 3:56:22.760]  In the next few days, maximum about a week, I think, and there is a T-shirt that you can
[3:56:22.760 --> 3:56:26.200]  get right now at infowarsstore.com.
[3:56:26.200 --> 3:56:29.000]  Trigger a leftist today.
[3:56:29.000 --> 3:56:34.160]  We've literally monetized liberal tears, and it's glorious.
[3:56:34.160 --> 3:56:35.160]  infowarsstore.com.
[3:56:35.160 --> 3:56:40.080]  A couple of minutes left, SHTF plan reports denying reality.
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:44.120]  The university's diversity training course suggests that it's racist to expect foreigners
[3:56:44.120 --> 3:56:46.080]  to show up on time.
[3:56:46.080 --> 3:56:53.160]  Now, it's the diversity training itself that's racist because it's the bigotry of low expectations
[3:56:53.160 --> 3:56:55.800]  treating people like this in the first place.
[3:56:55.800 --> 3:57:02.720]  It's similar to how now they're telling some schools that they shouldn't discipline
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:06.560]  low-income people who go to schools because, again, that will be discriminatory.
[3:57:06.560 --> 3:57:10.440]  So, again, you don't discipline children who act out what happens.
[3:57:10.440 --> 3:57:11.960]  They keep acting out.
[3:57:11.960 --> 3:57:12.960]  They get worse.
[3:57:12.960 --> 3:57:17.760]  So, it's the bigotry of low expectations, but don't tell that to Clemson University
[3:57:17.760 --> 3:57:23.600]  in South Carolina, taxpayer funded school that recently spent $27,000 on diversity
[3:57:23.600 --> 3:57:29.440]  training materials for their professors, and they actually tell them people from different
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:34.000]  cultures can't be held to the same standard as everyone else in our society because their
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:38.360]  perspective on time is just different.
[3:57:38.360 --> 3:57:40.600]  So they can get away with showing up late.
[3:57:40.600 --> 3:57:45.480]  They can get away with misbehaving, not doing work, and, of course, in the long term, that
[3:57:45.480 --> 3:57:48.320]  actually hurts those people.
[3:57:48.320 --> 3:57:52.960]  You go into the jobs market showing up late, not knowing your skills, being lazy, you're
[3:57:52.960 --> 3:57:53.960]  going to get fired.
[3:57:53.960 --> 3:57:59.280]  So, it's the diversity training itself that's racist.
[3:57:59.280 --> 3:58:03.960]  Absolutely incredible news story out of South Carolina.
[3:58:03.960 --> 3:58:07.400]  Al Gore, 15 trillion carbon tax.
[3:58:07.400 --> 3:58:09.360]  You might have seen this on Washington Examiner.
[3:58:09.360 --> 3:58:14.080]  Al Gore wants to reverse modernity and save the world from itself through an elimination
[3:58:14.080 --> 3:58:16.880]  of its fossil fuel-based energy system.
[3:58:16.880 --> 3:58:22.520]  He's literally going to set up a system which eviscerates the fossil fuel foundation that
[3:58:22.520 --> 3:58:24.600]  the planet runs on.
[3:58:24.600 --> 3:58:28.600]  This, again, is going to harm primarily people in the third world.
[3:58:28.600 --> 3:58:30.520]  It's going to prevent them from developing.
[3:58:30.520 --> 3:58:31.760]  It is a racist policy.
[3:58:31.760 --> 3:58:37.160]  That's going to wrap it up, Infowars Nightly News coming up, breaking news at infowars.com.
[3:58:37.160 --> 3:58:38.320]  Thanks for joining us.
[3:58:38.320 --> 3:58:48.160]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[3:58:48.160 --> 3:58:51.760]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[3:58:51.760 --> 3:58:53.240]  It took you over a year to do it.
[3:58:53.240 --> 3:58:54.960]  Why is this so good?
[3:58:54.960 --> 3:58:59.560]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[3:58:59.560 --> 3:59:04.280]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[3:59:04.280 --> 3:59:05.280]  my system.
[3:59:05.280 --> 3:59:10.520]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[3:59:10.520 --> 3:59:13.320]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[3:59:13.320 --> 3:59:18.400]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[3:59:18.400 --> 3:59:19.640]  going on everywhere.
[3:59:19.640 --> 3:59:20.640]  These are all parasites.
[3:59:20.640 --> 3:59:23.360]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[3:59:23.360 --> 3:59:24.600]  You have the neem in there.
[3:59:24.600 --> 3:59:27.680]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[3:59:27.680 --> 3:59:30.960]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[3:59:30.960 --> 3:59:31.960]  All right.
[3:59:31.960 --> 3:59:34.200]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[3:59:34.200 --> 3:59:35.320]  It just came back in yesterday.
[3:59:35.320 --> 3:59:36.320]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[3:59:36.320 --> 3:59:37.320]  And folks, you can't lose.
[3:59:37.320 --> 3:59:41.000]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.

[3:59:44.280 --> 3:59:46.480]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[3:59:46.480 --> 3:59:58.680]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
