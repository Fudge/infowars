[00:37.000 --> 00:42.120]  riots and demonstrations in Greece the police have stormed Bangkok a much of
[00:42.120 --> 00:49.680]  the city is on fire that is all coming up today we've got Charlie Veach on who's
[00:49.680 --> 00:54.160]  with the love police and other citizen activist group really having a big effect
[00:54.160 --> 01:01.240]  in the UK confronting globalists and exposing the false left-right paradigm
[01:01.240 --> 01:12.320]  and we've also got Ellen Brown on who has written a book about state banks and
[01:12.320 --> 01:19.480]  a new monetary system in this country that empowers the people so that is all
[01:19.480 --> 01:28.280]  coming up today now I've got four big stacks of news here that we are going to
[01:28.280 --> 01:33.560]  be covering in the meantime and we're going to have wide-open the phones at
[01:33.560 --> 01:45.120]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 we've got a lot of audio and video clips that
[01:45.120 --> 01:49.080]  we're gonna be playing as well today but the first thing I want to cover when we
[01:49.080 --> 01:55.440]  get back is the Mexican president to address a joint session of Congress
[01:55.440 --> 02:00.560]  today traveling all over the US not the first time shaking his finger at the
[02:00.560 --> 02:04.880]  American people and saying he represents and he is the leader of Hispanics in
[02:04.880 --> 02:09.000]  this nation and that we basically got a completely open our borders up I mean
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.040]  this is outrageous no other country would put up with this no other country
[02:14.040 --> 02:20.760]  would ever stand for this violation of sovereignty a foreign leader who clearly
[02:20.760 --> 02:25.640]  stole the election in Mexico who's been connected to all different forms of
[02:25.640 --> 02:34.000]  corruption running around telling us what to do as the American people it is
[02:34.000 --> 02:39.120]  just incredible we'll also get into the economy new claims shoot higher as
[02:39.120 --> 02:45.600]  jobless problem persists German Finance Minister markets are out of control
[02:45.600 --> 02:53.920]  banks to drop 12 to 15% then rebound so a lot of things happening in the
[02:53.920 --> 03:00.720]  markets right now Obama tells Mexican president we are not defined by our
[03:00.720 --> 03:07.320]  borders that's kind of like Lindsey Graham the senator saying that America is
[03:07.320 --> 03:11.720]  more of an idea rather than a place this is all part of the North American Union
[03:11.720 --> 03:19.160]  takeover and I put the name Rand Paul into search engine this morning into the
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.440]  NSA search engine that's that's what Google is government front they now
[03:23.440 --> 03:26.120]  admittedly have vans driving around everywhere not taking photos at your
[03:26.120 --> 03:29.120]  house but listening to everything you're doing tracking all your internet
[03:29.120 --> 03:34.840]  activity just completely lawless but I went into the NSA search engine Google
[03:34.840 --> 03:40.240]  and type his name in tens of thousands of articles almost all of them bashing
[03:40.240 --> 03:46.920]  Rand Paul and attacking him so the system is definitely scared of Rand Paul I
[03:46.920 --> 03:53.120]  want to go over a salon article and they've changed the headline since I
[03:53.120 --> 04:00.640]  read it this morning this morning it was Alex Jones Rand Paul is awesome and

[08:09.640 --> 08:17.520]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and
[08:17.520 --> 08:36.320]  now live from austin texas alex jones
[08:36.320 --> 08:43.560]  we're under a spell it's outrageous can you imagine if a u.s. president went to
[08:43.560 --> 08:49.120]  mexico and that there were 30 million americans living in mexico who were
[08:49.120 --> 08:54.960]  flying american flags and saying that mexico was part of the united states and
[08:54.960 --> 09:01.920]  that the mexican school children couldn't wear mexican flag shirts in mexico and
[09:01.920 --> 09:07.840]  then the mexican media went along with it and said it was bad that mexican kids
[09:07.840 --> 09:15.080]  were wearing mexican flags in mexico and it was bad that mexico might want to
[09:15.080 --> 09:21.200]  control some of its sovereignty i mean think about this look it's all about the
[09:21.200 --> 09:24.640]  north american union because when they set up a new economic and political
[09:24.640 --> 09:29.760]  order the globalists get to set the rules and we are in a north american
[09:29.760 --> 09:36.240]  union just like they officially set up the european union in 1957 and that's in
[09:36.240 --> 09:41.720]  the treaty of rome documents it's in the bilderberg group documents in 2007 they
[09:41.720 --> 09:49.080]  had the 50th anniversary in the EU with fireworks and celebrations and parades
[09:49.080 --> 09:54.720]  but the public was told the euro started in 2000 and then a few years later
[09:54.720 --> 10:00.480]  they say actually you've been in the european union for 50 years and it's the
[10:00.480 --> 10:08.880]  same thing dealing with the mexican president coming in to the united states
[10:08.880 --> 10:19.480]  and basically telling us our business and the media reporting it like it's a
[10:19.480 --> 10:27.760]  good thing like it's reasonable and members of the house and senate running
[10:27.760 --> 10:31.440]  around saying we've got to fix the immigration problem and how do they fix
[10:31.440 --> 10:36.400]  it total capitulation total open border to anybody that wanted wants to come to
[10:36.400 --> 10:41.200]  this nation to then be put on welfare and to be given free medical care as the
[10:41.200 --> 10:46.800]  united states collapses all over the country unlimited money for surveillance
[10:46.800 --> 10:52.520]  unlimited money for gps and id biometric cards for school kids and
[10:52.520 --> 10:56.600]  colleges announcing they're going to take your blood as part of entrance for
[10:56.600 --> 11:00.160]  a dna database and the police announcing they're going to take blood at
[11:00.160 --> 11:04.240]  checkpoints all over the country and now doing it and the government trying to
[11:04.240 --> 11:08.040]  pass legislation for public dna databases they already have the dna
[11:08.040 --> 11:13.720]  databases but now they want to be able to use it and have it be public unlimited
[11:13.720 --> 11:19.000]  money for all this control and for more prisons but then meanwhile all over the
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.680]  country they're announcing we're not going to fix bridges we're not going to
[11:21.680 --> 11:28.120]  fix roads we're not going to fix sidewalks we're going to slash all of the
[11:28.120 --> 11:33.760]  essential government services that government actually has a role in in
[11:33.760 --> 11:38.840]  the past and the government has control of that infrastructure everything is
[11:38.840 --> 11:44.880]  going to the police state on one side of the equation to oppress and control and
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.320]  extract wealth out of the people and the rest of the money is going to interest
[11:48.320 --> 11:53.480]  on made-up debts to the private central bankers and that is all coming up today
[11:53.480 --> 11:57.920]  but I wanted to play this clip of Obama telling Mexican president we are not
[11:57.920 --> 12:04.360]  defined by our borders here is a clip finally mr. president your visit speaks
[12:04.360 --> 12:09.440]  to a truth of our time in north america and the world in the 21st century we
[12:09.440 --> 12:14.560]  are defined not by our borders but by our bonds so I say to you and to the
[12:14.560 --> 12:20.320]  Mexican people let us stand together let us face the future together let us work
[12:20.320 --> 12:21.120]  together
[12:21.120 --> 12:27.280]  trabajemos juntos por último señor presidente su visita habla una de las
[12:27.280 --> 12:32.680]  grandes verdades de nuestra era en norte america y en el mundo entero en el
[12:32.680 --> 12:39.640]  siglo 21 no define no nuestras fronteras sino nuestros lazos de modo que le digo
[12:39.640 --> 12:46.480]  usted y le digo a todo el pueblo mexicano this is treason permanecamos juntos al
[12:46.480 --> 12:53.560]  encarar juntos el futuro trabajemos juntos present color on sonora the
[12:53.560 --> 12:57.160]  ball welcome to the united states
[12:57.160 --> 13:03.920]  incredible did you hear what he said he called us north america and he said
[13:03.920 --> 13:10.520]  we're not defined by our borders out in the open north american union doesn't
[13:10.520 --> 13:14.960]  matter who gets into office whether it's george herbert walker bush or bill
[13:14.960 --> 13:22.200]  clinton or george w bush or barack h. obama it does not matter they are
[13:22.200 --> 13:27.240]  getting rid of that border and they are getting rid of our sovereignty and they've
[13:27.240 --> 13:34.520]  used nafta and gat to deindustrialize this country and if you stand up and
[13:34.520 --> 13:41.960]  say i want to keep america free i want to keep america sovereign you are labeled
[13:41.960 --> 13:46.440]  an evil racist if you don't want the government running your health care and
[13:46.440 --> 13:49.640]  making you get health care if you don't want the government taking control of
[13:49.640 --> 13:54.840]  doctors and the decisions they can make you are a racist well this isn't gonna
[13:54.840 --> 13:59.600]  work anymore the establishment has gone too far the people don't care about the
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.720]  labels anymore the establishment is trying to divide the people by
[14:04.720 --> 14:10.280]  injecting race into all of these issues but it's simple mexico has lost wars
[14:10.280 --> 14:22.120]  with the united states spain russia england france have all controlled parts
[14:22.120 --> 14:27.920]  of the southwest and mexico has no claim on these areas just like spain and russia
[14:27.920 --> 14:33.160]  doesn't have claims on california though both of those nations have controlled
[14:33.160 --> 14:41.200]  and dominated areas of the west coast in the past it is an asinine claim and what
[14:41.200 --> 14:45.040]  they teach mexico's coming to the u.s. is you see all these skyscrapers you see
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.000]  all these swimming pools you see all this money well that's because the southwest
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  was stolen oh really the southwest was seen as barren and useless and worthless
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.080]  except for trade routes to the empire of spain that's why they never put money
[14:58.080 --> 15:03.720]  into defend it it was seen as worthless or near worthless by napoleon
[15:03.720 --> 15:09.080]  bonaparte that's why he sold much of the middle area and southern area of the
[15:09.080 --> 15:16.360]  country in the louisiana purchase for a pittance because it was just empty real
[15:16.360 --> 15:21.400]  estate with roving bands of natives who were also fighting and killing each
[15:21.400 --> 15:28.600]  other as well so the fact is this is taught in public schools in the u.s.
[15:28.600 --> 15:36.680]  this is taught in schools in mexico because it's part of this globalist
[15:36.680 --> 15:42.680]  takeover but this is treason to have a president up there saying we are not
[15:42.680 --> 15:49.000]  defined by our borders we are defined by by the region of north america and by
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.720]  our bonds see there he is saying we're not going to have borders in globalist
[15:54.720 --> 16:00.240]  speak and that's what this immigration reform legislation is it is a
[16:00.240 --> 16:03.880]  hemispheric north american union i d car they already have it issued by
[16:03.880 --> 16:09.080]  mexico the u.s. and canada for the last two years they run tv ads saying oh you
[16:09.080 --> 16:14.280]  don't have to get a passport get a north american i d car
[16:14.280 --> 16:18.840]  and two years ago i've got employees here in texas and state of texas
[16:18.840 --> 16:23.160]  basically works for the feds and the department of labor
[16:23.160 --> 16:27.960]  and uh two weeks before jerome course he wrote about it in world net daily
[16:27.960 --> 16:33.720]  just pointing out how real this is i got the forms i was supposed to fill out and
[16:33.720 --> 16:39.720]  said uh you you don't report to the uh department of labor anymore for the state
[16:39.720 --> 16:44.600]  of texas you report to the north american union
[16:44.600 --> 16:47.960]  so they've already officially done all of this
[16:47.960 --> 16:52.120]  and obama thinks you're so stupid he knows you only care about basketball and
[16:52.120 --> 16:58.680]  football and acting cool and so he sits right up there in front of you and says
[16:58.680 --> 17:05.320]  this for his part the mexican president said
[17:05.320 --> 17:08.600]  some things that were a bit more restrained than what he said in his own
[17:08.600 --> 17:12.760]  country which he called the arizona law which is not yet to go into effect
[17:12.760 --> 17:15.640]  an opening to hate and discrimination in that state
[17:15.640 --> 17:21.400]  here's what he said about arizona's immigration law on the south lawn
[17:21.400 --> 17:25.480]  we can't do so with a community that will promote
[17:25.480 --> 17:29.480]  a dignified life in an orderly way for both
[17:29.480 --> 17:33.800]  our countries who are some of them still living
[17:33.800 --> 17:40.200]  here in the shadows with such laws laws as the arizona law
[17:40.200 --> 17:45.800]  that is placing our people to face discrimination
[17:45.800 --> 17:49.720]  face discrimination in arizona which is completely alive as it should travel
[17:49.720 --> 17:52.280]  warning any mexicans who may travel to arizona
[17:52.280 --> 17:57.800]  a complete lie you've got 800 plus cities
[17:57.800 --> 18:01.640]  where the illegal aliens are let go for drunk driving
[18:01.640 --> 18:06.360]  they're released for crimes that citizens have the book thrown at them
[18:06.360 --> 18:09.560]  they're given preferential treatment on loans they don't have to show the ids
[18:09.560 --> 18:15.400]  citizens have to show to get bank loans now let's go back again to that first
[18:15.400 --> 18:20.600]  clip obama tells mexican president we are not defined by our borders here it is
[18:20.600 --> 18:24.280]  finally mr president your visit speaks to a truth of our time
[18:24.280 --> 18:28.680]  in north america and the world in the 21st century we are defined not by our
[18:28.680 --> 18:32.760]  borders but by our bonds so i say to you and to the
[18:32.760 --> 18:37.640]  mexican people let us stand together let us face the future together
[18:37.640 --> 18:44.360]  let us work together ok so basically more treason
[18:44.360 --> 18:49.640]  he says we don't have borders i want the mexican people to pour in and to
[18:49.640 --> 18:52.920]  keep their nationality and to help destroy the united states

[24:06.840 --> 24:09.640]  collapsing and on its days they've already done it but they haven't
[24:09.640 --> 24:12.760]  announced it yet they're stalling the population because they know the
[24:12.760 --> 24:16.760]  backlash is going to be so huge but the public is waking up despite their
[24:16.760 --> 24:20.440]  propaganda and throwing out every incumbent
[24:20.440 --> 24:26.200]  whether the republican or democrat in the primaries from Utah to Kentucky
[24:26.200 --> 24:33.000]  from Pennsylvania to California this is now happening so they're in a
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.840]  race to erase the border and they've got a giant
[24:36.840 --> 24:41.160]  hoax going where they're saying oh we just simply
[24:41.160 --> 24:47.640]  uh want to be able to
[24:47.640 --> 24:52.200]  help these people get you know proper ids and
[24:52.200 --> 24:55.480]  and and and we want to fix the immigration problem uh
[24:55.480 --> 24:59.080]  we want to secure the border by just getting rid of it and it will get rid
[24:59.080 --> 25:01.960]  of the problem if you think illegal immigration is a
[25:01.960 --> 25:05.800]  problem it just makes it legal completely open borders in the
[25:05.800 --> 25:10.200]  north american union and this is what the security
[25:10.200 --> 25:12.520]  and prosperity partnership documents that have come out in the news in the
[25:12.520 --> 25:16.040]  last three years that we cover my film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[25:16.040 --> 25:18.840]  show that they are going to have a continental
[25:18.840 --> 25:22.120]  security perimeter from alaska to southern mexico
[25:22.120 --> 25:25.400]  on the guatemala border
[25:26.200 --> 25:33.000]  unlimited immigration absolutely open and that's why i've noticed though i've
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.880]  heard them on talk radio illegal aliens call into shows and they'll say are you
[25:35.880 --> 25:38.840]  an illegal alien they say yeah i'm here illegally i'll do whatever i want i'll
[25:38.840 --> 25:41.960]  travel wherever i want we've had them call into this show but i hear them on
[25:41.960 --> 25:45.160]  other talk radio shows and the host will always ask well are you for more
[25:45.160 --> 25:47.960]  illegals coming in and most of them go no
[25:47.960 --> 25:52.520]  they're driving down my wages i don't want them here
[25:52.520 --> 25:55.480]  see this is globalization this is a race to the bottom
[25:55.480 --> 26:00.760]  nafta and gat didn't help mexico the government in the last 15 years
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.320]  are longer forced most of the indigenous groups
[26:05.320 --> 26:09.320]  uh in the interior of mexico off of their land through un biosphere
[26:09.320 --> 26:13.240]  operations they then took the land sold it off to globalist
[26:13.240 --> 26:16.680]  turned it into national parks they forced tens of millions of people up into
[26:16.680 --> 26:19.720]  mexico city and then north up into the maquiladoras
[26:19.720 --> 26:23.000]  and now almost all the maquiladoras are empty
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.960]  you see because mexico couldn't even compete
[26:27.960 --> 26:32.840]  with china in the first phase uh they were just competing with the u.s and it
[26:32.840 --> 26:35.560]  helped deindustrialize the united states then the united states
[26:35.560 --> 26:39.800]  didn't have the money as u.s consumers
[26:39.800 --> 26:44.680]  to buy their goods anymore and so now mexico's in worse shape
[26:44.680 --> 26:48.680]  the united states is in worse shape if every legal alien had been forced to
[26:48.680 --> 26:51.800]  stay in mexico in the last 30 years that country would
[26:51.800 --> 26:54.600]  probably be free right now there's no way that nation
[26:54.600 --> 26:57.880]  could have continued the corruption they've had they've barely
[26:57.880 --> 27:04.680]  kept control of the population since then
[27:04.680 --> 27:13.640]  but by using the united states as a political steam valve
[27:16.200 --> 27:19.560]  as a place to send the criminal element and others
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.640]  they have been able to maintain some control though they are
[27:23.640 --> 27:29.720]  a failed state meanwhile as the bankers make their move to
[27:29.720 --> 27:33.640]  consolidate power globally and to fund their expansion of world government
[27:33.640 --> 27:39.240]  there are all sorts of violent things happening not just in greece
[27:39.240 --> 27:42.440]  but in thailand and of course bloomberg business reporting
[27:42.440 --> 27:46.840]  ottawa police investigate royal bank firebombing and
[27:46.840 --> 27:52.120]  video of this has been released canada's government
[27:52.120 --> 27:55.880]  condemned a firebombing of a royal bank of canada branch in ottawa and said it
[27:55.880 --> 27:59.720]  is prepared to respond to any threats of violence against the group of 20
[27:59.720 --> 28:07.000]  leaders summit in toronto next week
[28:12.600 --> 28:16.840]  now an anarchist group has claimed uh responsibility for the ottawa bank
[28:16.840 --> 28:20.440]  firebombing and the national post reports completely burned the building
[28:20.440 --> 28:23.640]  out why is this news because a bank got attacked i mean an
[28:23.640 --> 28:27.320]  anarchist group supporting illegal aliens uh three
[28:27.320 --> 28:31.160]  weeks ago in uh santa cruz firebombed a restaurant
[28:31.160 --> 28:34.440]  with people in it thank god they got out of the building
[28:34.440 --> 28:37.640]  there's debate about whether it was an illegal alien march or an anarchist march
[28:37.640 --> 28:41.080]  well ap reported it was a pro-immigrant rights march
[28:41.080 --> 28:45.640]  that turned violent scores of businesses one report said 18 one said 20
[28:45.640 --> 28:49.560]  i had their windows all knocked out and a restaurant got set on fire
[28:49.560 --> 28:54.040]  imagine people marching through the streets with torches with deadly weapons
[28:54.040 --> 28:57.880]  and the police just retreated and basically did nothing and and then
[28:57.880 --> 29:00.680]  called in backup
[29:01.320 --> 29:06.680]  imagine that and it it only made the local news
[29:08.120 --> 29:12.920]  on television it it did make the ap nationally but notice now this building
[29:12.920 --> 29:16.120]  is firebombed in the middle of the night no one is in it
[29:16.120 --> 29:20.040]  which does not make it attempted murder it's attempted murder
[29:20.040 --> 29:23.800]  when you firebomb a restaurant at 10 o'clock at night in santa cruz that is
[29:23.800 --> 29:27.160]  attempted murder
[29:27.160 --> 29:30.200]  but this isn't even attempted murder and it's all
[29:30.200 --> 29:33.960]  over the news and it should be all over the news
[29:33.960 --> 29:36.840]  but how many times have we caught anarchist groups working for the feds or
[29:36.840 --> 29:39.240]  big foundations so that's coming up too here's another

[33:40.840 --> 33:44.920]  in ontario and toronto respectively next month and the group claiming
[33:44.920 --> 33:48.120]  responsibility for the bank attack vows that its members will be there to
[33:48.120 --> 33:51.400]  protest exploitation of the people and the
[33:51.400 --> 33:54.840]  environment yeah you don't give us carbon taxes we burn you out
[33:54.840 --> 34:00.280]  uh and it goes on here with the police saying that the anarchist are always
[34:00.280 --> 34:05.400]  trying to interfere with them and incite them
[34:05.400 --> 34:09.560]  when the police were caught the royal amount of police two years ago
[34:09.560 --> 34:12.920]  this was in the national post as well as the toronto star
[34:12.920 --> 34:18.040]  dressed up like an artist attacking other police on video camera
[34:18.040 --> 34:22.040]  in front of the news so they have a pretext to attack the peaceful
[34:22.040 --> 34:26.280]  crowds so that is some of the other news uh that is coming up
[34:26.280 --> 34:30.600]  i also want to get into the vicious attacks on rand paul the system is
[34:30.600 --> 34:34.440]  really scared we'll also get into the latest developments
[34:34.440 --> 34:38.200]  uh with the economy uh today and we do have two guests
[34:38.200 --> 34:42.040]  coming up later in the broadcast but right now let's talk to joshua in

[34:53.480 --> 34:56.440]  seen that yes yes i meant to cover that two weeks ago
[34:56.440 --> 35:01.640]  uh that was in my list in my stack uh to cover we wrote a info wars dot com
[35:01.640 --> 35:06.040]  story uh with the title uh council on foreign relations propaganda in fact
[35:06.040 --> 35:08.920]  guys will you pull that article up and get that video ready i know we have it
[35:08.920 --> 35:12.440]  in the computer and perhaps i'll have time to play that next hour what do you
[35:12.440 --> 35:15.240]  think of it i just thought it looked like you know total
[35:15.240 --> 35:17.880]  propaganda i was wondering if you were going to do like a breakdown on it or
[35:17.880 --> 35:20.680]  whatever but uh you know it's weird that they're finally
[35:20.680 --> 35:24.440]  kind of unveiling themselves you know here as we see everything is becoming
[35:24.440 --> 35:27.800]  so much more overt well and did you hear those big
[35:27.800 --> 35:31.640]  brazinski audio and video we played yesterday where he admitted
[35:31.640 --> 35:35.640]  the world government's in trouble this is the first time everybody worldwide is
[35:35.640 --> 35:39.880]  waking up to us and we've got a problem i mean they
[35:39.880 --> 35:43.080]  they have tried to lie to people and say there's no such thing as a world
[35:43.080 --> 35:45.960]  government but now they know that the public
[35:45.960 --> 35:48.840]  is awake to their lies so they're coming out and
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.920]  you know having angelina joe lee and others tell us how great the cfr is and
[35:52.920 --> 35:55.720]  how they love us and how they care about us
[35:55.720 --> 35:59.240]  yeah absolutely i saw that and i also saw something pretty disturbing from
[35:59.240 --> 36:03.320]  cnn they did a piece called american al qaeda i don't know if you got a chance
[36:03.320 --> 36:06.920]  to watch that but it actually just shows this gentleman in his road to
[36:06.920 --> 36:09.560]  radicalization his road to al qaeda and it said
[36:09.560 --> 36:13.400]  what happened was he was spending too much time on the internet and he came to
[36:13.400 --> 36:17.400]  believe that the federal government was involved with 9 11 so that somehow
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.480]  justified jihad have you seen that yes i did see
[36:21.480 --> 36:24.760]  some short club seven online a few days ago it aired over the weekend with
[36:24.760 --> 36:28.600]  anderson cooper and i've been explaining forever
[36:28.600 --> 36:32.600]  that they're gonna gear up and talk about wide al qaeda american al qaeda
[36:32.600 --> 36:36.120]  and tie it to in the fed movements tea parties
[36:36.120 --> 36:39.400]  9 11 truthers anybody that doesn't trust the government
[36:39.400 --> 36:43.320]  and understands what's going on they're gonna try to tie to terrorism
[36:43.320 --> 36:46.600]  as they openly move to secretly arrest citizens for
[36:46.600 --> 36:50.840]  any secretive reason they wish as they openly move to crack down on free
[36:50.840 --> 36:52.760]  speech on the web i appreciate your call
[36:52.760 --> 36:57.640]  justin and arizona you're on the air sir thanks for taking my call
[36:57.640 --> 37:02.040]  welcome hey uh i found a little bit of an interesting
[37:02.040 --> 37:07.400]  predicament when you're calling you know blaming obama for treason because the
[37:07.400 --> 37:10.120]  only person in this country that's committing treason
[37:10.120 --> 37:16.120]  is you okay you guys did not global warming you
[37:16.120 --> 37:19.960]  think that arab's had absolutely nothing to do with 9 11 you
[37:19.960 --> 37:23.640]  guys were left behind by science none of your points are believed by any sector
[37:23.640 --> 37:26.120]  of society for god's sakes alex yesterday
[37:26.120 --> 37:29.640]  compares with compared us to going worms what's wrong with you
[37:29.640 --> 37:33.400]  people out there listening right now don't believe this hack he's a fraud
[37:33.400 --> 37:37.400]  he's a loser he makes millions of dollars a year and he wants people
[37:37.400 --> 37:42.280]  like you to send in money to him don't believe it he's a fraud
[37:42.280 --> 37:44.680]  all right i'm gonna put you on hold justin and then i'm gonna try to go to
[37:44.680 --> 37:47.960]  this point by point we do make millions of dollars a year you are
[37:47.960 --> 37:51.720]  absolutely right and we spend millions of dollars a year
[37:51.720 --> 37:55.000]  on our 10 000 plus square foot facility
[37:55.000 --> 38:02.120]  and my 400 000 a year bandwidth bill and my 20 plus employees and contractors
[38:02.120 --> 38:08.040]  you bet we probably make half as much money as a popular barbecue stand
[38:08.040 --> 38:12.200]  here in austin i wish we made
[38:12.200 --> 38:16.040]  five million dollars a year instead of two million dollars a year because then
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.200]  i could really expand what we're doing and put out more films for free for
[38:20.200 --> 38:25.000]  everyone how dare i how dare i make 20 plus
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.680]  films and write books and publish books and produce documentaries
[38:28.680 --> 38:33.400]  how dare i sell them so that i hopefully get enough money back to make
[38:33.400 --> 38:36.440]  another one some films lose money some films make money
[38:36.440 --> 38:41.320]  and are put back into the operation how dare i notice he calls in and plays that
[38:41.320 --> 38:44.840]  money card you've got trillions of dollars of your tax
[38:44.840 --> 38:48.520]  money disappearing into offshore banks they won't tell congress they won't
[38:48.520 --> 38:52.040]  tell the british parliament they won't the e u government won't tell
[38:52.040 --> 38:55.240]  the member states where the money goes but that's
[38:55.240 --> 39:03.080]  not a problem i'm a hack i'm a fraud so so see first he has that ad hominem
[39:03.080 --> 39:10.120]  uh divide and conquer class warfare uh statement that he
[39:10.120 --> 39:13.240]  throws out that's what the mainstream media always does you know they can pay
[39:13.240 --> 39:17.160]  their reporters five million dollars a year to read off a teleprompter
[39:17.160 --> 39:24.360]  then he says i'm a hack and a fraud because i have exposed global warming
[39:24.360 --> 39:29.080]  sir we have the internal emails that they're hiding the decline
[39:29.080 --> 39:33.080]  they now admit the earth has been cooling for a decade it stopped warming
[39:33.080 --> 39:37.480]  15 years ago okay stopped warming 15 years ago
[39:37.480 --> 39:41.320]  then five years into stopping warming the cooling began
[39:41.320 --> 39:45.960]  the un and others and universities have been caught faking the temperature data
[39:45.960 --> 39:50.440]  numbers from the thermostats and buoys uh i mean if i went over the fraud again
[39:50.440 --> 39:54.360]  it and when we've covered it at nauseam it's covered an end game it's covered
[39:54.360 --> 39:57.000]  an obama deception it's covered in fall the republic
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.520]  i mean this is a fact sir and even if you believe carbon dioxide is a deadly
[40:00.520 --> 40:03.960]  nerve gas you know this is so horrible and kills everything and it comes in
[40:03.960 --> 40:11.000]  contact with uh the cutting our emissions
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.280]  when china and india and mexico and others aren't
[40:14.280 --> 40:18.840]  cutting them will only increase emissions see we have less emissions here we
[40:18.840 --> 40:21.560]  have cleaner standards if you believe carbon dioxide is bad
[40:21.560 --> 40:27.080]  so going to china and india where they have no emissions controls will increase
[40:27.080 --> 40:34.360]  the devil gas now saying i have compared people to worms
[40:34.360 --> 40:40.200]  is not what i did but let me explain it again in case you missed it
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.760]  i talked about how much greater and more powerful and intelligent humans are
[40:44.760 --> 40:47.960]  compared to a glow worm and i talked about if you're walking through the
[40:47.960 --> 40:52.360]  woods at night one little glow worm you can barely
[40:52.360 --> 40:56.280]  even see it in the dark of night glowing there on the forest floor
[40:56.280 --> 41:00.040]  but when there are thousands and thousands of glow worms
[41:00.040 --> 41:04.760]  uh who are you know out there mating and then so they glow as part of their
[41:04.760 --> 41:08.120]  their uh you know mating process to uh you know to
[41:08.120 --> 41:12.200]  adversize themselves like a peacock puts out its its its feathers and does a
[41:12.200 --> 41:17.560]  dance to the female that together in the aggregate it it
[41:17.560 --> 41:22.280]  creates a lot of light and so i went on with the analogy of humans poking
[41:22.280 --> 41:26.040]  holes in the electronic berlin wall of lies
[41:26.040 --> 41:29.560]  and then how the sunshine sunshine of truth
[41:29.560 --> 41:36.520]  pours in so uh another false statement uh by you
[41:36.520 --> 41:39.000]  well frankly i just went into the analogy because i was thinking about
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.320]  walking around on the forest at night and how much i love it and how i never
[41:41.320 --> 41:46.600]  get to do it uh but um so another bizarre statement
[41:46.600 --> 41:49.960]  from you uh we told folks that gold was going to go from
[41:49.960 --> 41:53.080]  300 to above a thousand seven years ago it has
[41:53.080 --> 41:56.360]  we told people that they were going to stage a 9-11 attack on the world trade
[41:56.360 --> 41:59.320]  centers two months before it happened they would blame it on their asset as
[41:59.320 --> 42:01.240]  someone been lauding they would attack afghanistan
[42:01.240 --> 42:05.080]  that happened we told people in january of last year they were going to launch a
[42:05.080 --> 42:08.280]  giant flu hoax because we were interviewing the emergency managers
[42:08.280 --> 42:13.320]  and others and getting secret documents out of the bureau of
[42:13.320 --> 42:17.160]  cemeteries uh in new york state and other documents
[42:17.160 --> 42:20.120]  of course that then happened uh we talked about how they were going to
[42:20.120 --> 42:23.960]  create a derivatives bomb to bring down the world markets and and get the
[42:23.960 --> 42:26.680]  nation states in greater debt to the private central banks
[42:26.680 --> 42:30.680]  we talked about how they would take trillions of dollars not 800 billion
[42:30.680 --> 42:33.400]  uh and that they would not tell congress where the money went and that they
[42:33.400 --> 42:36.520]  would not spend it to re uh to unfreeze mortgages
[42:36.520 --> 42:39.960]  they've since clamped down even more that all happened
[42:39.960 --> 42:43.560]  everything we've talked about has happened i told you back in january of
[42:43.560 --> 42:46.920]  last year that obama's approval rating would go from 80%
[42:46.920 --> 42:51.160]  into the low 40s or even lower and that he would continue torture secret arrest
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.320]  expand wars hire nothing but lobbyist and then his real names bury sataro
[42:55.320 --> 42:59.160]  that's now all mainstream news and admitted uh so you know what
[42:59.160 --> 43:02.840]  whether you like it or not justin everybody's starting to listen to what
[43:02.840 --> 43:06.520]  we have to say because unlike you they are intelligent
[43:06.520 --> 43:10.120]  so you call in so emotional your voice shaking
[43:10.120 --> 43:14.520]  like i'm gonna cut you off any minute the truth is uh justin

[43:47.480 --> 43:52.040]  mammal homo sapien sapien produces see those breasts are for a reason they're
[43:52.040 --> 43:56.520]  designed to feed you now my mother breastfed me till i was 18 months
[43:56.520 --> 44:00.120]  old i've got a big brain okay i i got my full
[44:00.120 --> 44:03.160]  development and i'm sorry you were given formula i'm
[44:03.160 --> 44:07.400]  sorry your parents bought into you know easy living and and and the
[44:07.400 --> 44:09.960]  the media told them it was okay to give you formula
[44:09.960 --> 44:13.560]  that designed so that you would not have good brain development
[44:13.560 --> 44:18.280]  uh and and and i mean let me guess you you were not breastfed were you justin
[44:18.280 --> 44:22.200]  listen to me the only reason you got caught shut up and answer my question
[44:22.200 --> 44:27.240]  shut up punk shut up coward i'm asking you your mommy didn't breastfeed you did
[44:27.240 --> 44:30.040]  she no the only reason you have people like me

[44:34.680 --> 44:37.880]  coward and you're scum and it doesn't matter what you say
[44:37.880 --> 44:41.320]  everybody knows global warming's a fraud now punk
[44:41.320 --> 44:45.080]  and we've got the courage to expose it when it's unpopular now it's popular
[44:45.080 --> 44:48.520]  we've got the courage to expose 9-11 when it's unpopular to do it
[44:48.520 --> 44:52.360]  because we don't care you understand that justin i'm sorry mommy didn't take
[44:52.360 --> 44:55.480]  care of you okay i'm sorry you've got a little
[44:55.480 --> 45:03.720]  shriveled brain justin you're a shill

[45:08.200 --> 45:10.600]  justin put him on hold go on the internet make up more
[45:10.600 --> 45:14.360]  lies about me it only helps me just point everybody at info wars dot com
[45:14.360 --> 45:17.560]  and prison planet dot com now i illustrate the breastfeeding issue
[45:17.560 --> 45:21.320]  because uh the studies are out there you can pull them up
[45:21.320 --> 45:28.120]  um breastfeeding you know higher iq's larger brain ccc cc size
[45:28.120 --> 45:32.440]  uh and it's just a fact and i also get up here and warm people about giving
[45:32.440 --> 45:36.360]  their children sodium fluoride because it can cause upwards of a 20-point iq
[45:36.360 --> 45:40.600]  reduction if your children drink sodium fluoride or brush their
[45:40.600 --> 45:45.320]  teeth with sodium fluoride so so i can illustrate this to
[45:45.320 --> 45:48.520]  people and i'm not saying parents are bad they gave their children formula they
[45:48.520 --> 45:53.000]  believed what the government told them they believed
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.560]  that that it was a good thing they believe that
[45:57.560 --> 46:01.000]  different forms of birth control wouldn't sterilize them
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.280]  like we had in this country in the 70s and 80s
[46:04.280 --> 46:07.480]  with the devices they would implant in women's
[46:07.480 --> 46:10.760]  uteruses that were designed to destroy their fertility
[46:10.760 --> 46:14.680]  they believe that soy was good for them when it massively reduces
[46:14.680 --> 46:19.720]  fertility and so look i understand and i i i should
[46:19.720 --> 46:22.760]  actually be very sad for you i'm not being sarcastic right now
[46:22.760 --> 46:26.600]  i understand that you're angry okay but don't worry
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.480]  the globalists are destroying america our industrial base is basically gone
[46:31.480 --> 46:36.840]  okay okay and uh don't worry you don't have much of a
[46:36.840 --> 46:39.720]  future justin you're gonna have it the way you want it
[46:39.720 --> 46:43.160]  all right don't worry you know the globalists might beat people like me you
[46:43.160 --> 46:48.120]  might win okay all right i'll tell you what that
[46:48.120 --> 46:52.760]  was a uh a real moron
[46:52.760 --> 46:57.800]  oh boy who's up next here howard and philly
[46:57.800 --> 47:01.480]  howard you're on the air go ahead i gotta tell you something
[47:01.480 --> 47:05.720]  i'm aggravated how much time you just gave that guy you got people on hold with
[47:05.720 --> 47:09.240]  good info and you you let him let allow you to
[47:09.240 --> 47:15.160]  degenerate into uh it's all down to his level and it was
[47:15.160 --> 47:18.200]  i'm looking at the time and i'm sitting here he was getting upset though
[47:18.200 --> 47:21.640]  because i guarantee you that that poor guy comes from a single parent family
[47:21.640 --> 47:25.080]  not attacking single parent families but uh you know it's a fact
[47:25.080 --> 47:29.160]  and and and that guy you know just didn't have great parents and he has a
[47:29.160 --> 47:31.720]  small brain and i'm feel sorry for him go ahead
[47:31.720 --> 47:35.640]  alex i understand that but why did you and that's not my topic
[47:35.640 --> 47:39.080]  yeah let's not spend any more time on it go ahead you're doing what i did
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.640]  well to a degree let's talk about thailand i got a couple of things i want to
[47:43.640 --> 47:46.120]  tell you i lived in thailand for three years
[47:46.120 --> 47:52.120]  from 2006 until 2009 i know ties i know thailand i know exactly what's going on
[47:52.120 --> 47:55.080]  there and everybody's been giving explanations and not
[47:55.080 --> 47:58.920]  really simplifying it so that the american audience can understand what's
[47:58.920 --> 48:02.680]  happening over there it's so simple it's not funny
[48:02.680 --> 48:06.920]  the yellow shirts are for the monarchy the monarchy
[48:06.920 --> 48:10.280]  funds the yellow shirts that were allowed to take over the airport
[48:10.280 --> 48:14.440]  two airports while i was there they didn't fire a shot at them there was no
[48:14.440 --> 48:17.240]  violence there was hardly anything the police stood there
[48:17.240 --> 48:20.840]  watch them take over the airport watch the mid convenience everybody
[48:20.840 --> 48:24.680]  traveling in and out of thailand we're traveling through thailand
[48:24.680 --> 48:27.640]  and it became the laughing stock but the monarchy
[48:27.640 --> 48:31.560]  doesn't care because the monarchy's got a vice grip on the people
[48:31.560 --> 48:35.400]  they've they've stolen most of the money from the people as it is
[48:35.400 --> 48:38.520]  and the people who are wearing the red shirts
[48:38.520 --> 48:41.640]  are the ones who were voted into political power
[48:41.640 --> 48:45.240]  whether or not taxon was a corrupt scumbag which he was
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.240]  he was still voted in properly and they were removed twice
[48:49.240 --> 48:53.560]  and they're angry they want their country and they're tired the monarchy
[48:53.560 --> 48:56.840]  dictating how things go because it didn't work it
[48:56.840 --> 49:02.920]  and they can see that there is a huge united states influence in thailand
[49:02.920 --> 49:06.520]  and just to understate that point uh underscore that point
[49:06.520 --> 49:10.120]  my wife went to open a bank account two years ago in thailand that she's a
[49:10.120 --> 49:14.120]  guy they handed her the requisite 10 forms to fill out
[49:14.120 --> 49:17.800]  she shows me this one form and she says why are they asking me these questions
[49:17.800 --> 49:21.160]  i said well what's on the form it was all in time i said well what are they
[49:21.160 --> 49:24.840]  asking you she says well what i do how i make my money
[49:24.840 --> 49:28.920]  where i spend my money and i look on the top of the form and small letters at
[49:28.920 --> 49:32.840]  the top the only english on the entire form was
[49:32.840 --> 49:39.240]  know your customer so here we've got the know your customer program
[49:39.240 --> 49:44.200]  instituted in the tie banking system from the americans
[49:44.200 --> 49:46.920]  now here's the third thing i want to tell you
[49:46.920 --> 49:50.840]  uh three days ago in philadelphia 75 police cars
[49:50.840 --> 49:54.840]  homeland security vehicles all with sirens blazing
[49:54.840 --> 49:58.360]  uh lights going went through center city philadelphia
[49:58.360 --> 50:03.080]  at 10 30 in the afternoon and scared the hell out of a lot of people
[50:03.080 --> 50:06.680]  now i find these things very curious because when i went to search the next
[50:06.680 --> 50:10.280]  day on google or look in the local newspapers
[50:10.280 --> 50:14.520]  there was nothing about it well what's happening everywhere as they're doing
[50:14.520 --> 50:17.640]  counterterrorism drills and riot control drills
[50:17.640 --> 50:20.920]  i mean i literally see scores of articles every day
[50:20.920 --> 50:24.200]  to acclimate the public the pentagon admits that's what all this urban war
[50:24.200 --> 50:27.880]  fair uh training is for is to condition and acclimate
[50:27.880 --> 50:32.360]  uh the the population and so that's what's happening here my friend
[50:32.360 --> 50:36.040]  well here's the question though how do they keep this from the papers
[50:36.040 --> 50:40.680]  the the only way that i agree that i know about it i wasn't downtown at the time
[50:40.680 --> 50:44.680]  is that i saw it on the ten o'clock fox news
[50:44.680 --> 50:49.160]  and they were talking about it in terms of this was like a scene out of 24
[50:49.160 --> 50:54.040]  that was monday night when they show 24 now we'll check into it i appreciate

[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.280]  at work i find that information find one information
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:18.360]  uh... on how many actually were fighting in the revolution
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.520]  for for texas
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.200]  uh... no no for the uh... colonies
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.840]  back in seventeen seventy six
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.780]  yeah i'm sorry my
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:30.960]  my line to you was breaking up when you ask the question so so ask it again
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.920]  okay
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.520]  uh... my question is the amount the percentage of people
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.840]  that uh... we're in the revolutionary war
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.280]  uh... for our side
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.000]  oh it's in a lot of history books they debate the number something like one or
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.120]  two percent
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.760]  got things started
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:53.000]  about three to four percent depending on what historical text you look at
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.600]  uh... we're involved in the early stages of the war once it began in seventeen
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.800]  seventy five it really began in seventeen seventy five on july four
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.040]  seventeen seventy six that was the unanimous declaration
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.720]  uh... and then
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.000]  by the end maybe six seven eight percent
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.440]  uh... but i don't have those historical text in front of me but it's it's
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.760]  widely accepted historical fact and is in uh... the uh... reports of the time
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.680]  it's in the british dispatches
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.800]  uh... what the british were estimating
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.880]  most people were neutral
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.160]  and then around twenty percent were tories or loyal to the crown
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.720]  uh... so basically
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.960]  to simplify it five percent
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.680]  beat the twenty percent
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.880]  that supported the crown
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.800]  thank you
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.960]  and then i have a more comment
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.640]  we ought to have volunteers to start piling up rocks
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.500]  on the border
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.960]  and pile up so high that it'd be hard to get across
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.600]  well you know it's a two thousand plus model border and there's a lot of
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.480]  private property issues
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.120]  and uh... uh... i think you mentioned a hole in the rocks for that people would
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.400]  just remove the rocks and climb over
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.360]  uh... we need to put pressure on the mexican government that's collapsed
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.600]  uh... to stop using the united states as a steam valve
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.840]  and uh... and plus sending in masses of people from mexico than send their money
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.240]  back to mexico
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.480]  uh... basically supports the corrupt government
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.560]  and we cut off all the u s aid to mexico the tens of billions of dollars a
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.600]  year of taxpayer money
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.560]  uh... that's going into that country but is an anger you to see
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.720]  the mexican president up here
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:26.000]  invoking and calling on thirty million illegals as his political weapon inside
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.220]  our nation i mean that's a
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.920]  that's a military attack
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.440]  right i mean it's it's righteous anger i believe because i believe in god and we
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:33.880]  were
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.280]  our country was
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.200]  founded under god
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.200]  and uh... the gods that i believe are in charge here i mean

[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:31.160]  see berkeley asking incoming students for dna now you see an article like this by
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:36.040]  itself and it's it's already very serious but when you know bill clinton
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:42.280]  silent executive order back in 1994 that we cover my first film america
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.880]  destroyed by design where they said that in the future it's on the books they're
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:53.080]  just not enforcing it you will give a dna sample to get a driver's license and
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.280]  then of course it's now mainstream news that for almost 40 years 38 years and
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.400]  counting all over the western world part of a un secret program that that's how
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:06.720]  secretive and corrupt and out of control the government is blood has been
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:15.160]  taken from babies and put in a u n slash dna ibm pentagon database system and
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:19.120]  that of course is now mainstream news people just a few months ago were were
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.840]  shocked calling me in mass and emailing me saying i thought you were lying all
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:27.280]  those years about this i mean we were posting the government documents i was
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.840]  having congressman on about it i was having lawmakers from australia on i
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:37.120]  mean this is worldwide we don't make things up
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:40.880]  well now if you want to go to college you're gonna have to give dna and all
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.240]  over the country in the last three years the feds are paying with federal
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.400]  grants for warrantless checkpoints where they take your blood
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.080]  that's another key article curtain emos got up prison time for pot smoking and
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.040]  the new federal guidelines to the states say if they want federal law
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.680]  enforcement money they need to do blood test on people they pull over and
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:06.080]  marijuana stays in your system in least 30 days and if any thc is found
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.760]  let's say you smoked a joint 30 days before you are going to prison
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:15.360]  for the equivalent of a dw i and that's in my stack i'm gonna cover that uh
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:21.600]  more uh coming up when the love police join us in the next hour
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.720]  but uh uc berkeley asking incoming students for dna
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.360]  uc berkeley is adding something a little different
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.360]  this year to its welcome package cotton swabs for a dna sample out of your
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.160]  cheek in the past incoming freshmen and transfer
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.160]  students have received a rather typical welcome book yeah a bunch of deadly
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.840]  vaccine shots uh college of letters and science on the same
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.120]  page but this year the students will be asked for more
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:54.960]  and then it goes on from there and uh that integrates in with this article
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:00.560]  out of the san francisco chronicle apple won't take ipad buyers cash
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:05.360]  doesn't matter if it's registered with atn t with your name and driver's license
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.880]  it doesn't matter uh that you you cannot pay with
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.040]  cash so we see all over the world cash being phased out for the cashless
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:18.480]  society uh surveillance grid designed to track and
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:25.680]  control uh every facet of your life apple wants your money just not
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:29.840]  the paper kind as one bay area woman discovered recently while trying to buy
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:33.280]  an ipad diane cambell who is disabled on a fixed
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.120]  income saved up enough cash for an ipad according to abc seven
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.880]  consumer report michael finney she was about to plunk down 600 greenbacks at
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.280]  the palo alto store for a new tablet computer when she was
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.200]  reportedly told the store would not accept cash stunned
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:58.240]  she walked away ipadless with the backpack full of cash and again this is
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.920]  your all criminals now under this is globally happening
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:08.720]  simultaneously it's concerted orchestrated all over the world uh they
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.200]  are expanding the know your customer and that's in this new quote bank
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.360]  re-regulation we're going to get wall street we're going to give them even more power
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.760]  more money like we're going to get the insurance companies we're going to have
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.640]  them write a bill to make you buy overpriced insurance from them and
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.680]  they can decide what care you get and cut cost and we're going to cut medicare
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.320]  by 20 plus percent yes that will we're going to raise your taxes and cut the
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:35.440]  funding but i'm already digressing the point
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:39.040]  is they want to track everything you're doing
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.680]  and in the new legislation every purchase every credit card purchase
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:47.040]  everything you do online with online banking every
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.400]  uh thing you purchase the government live time
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.560]  in your bank account and they're going to phase out the cash
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:00.640]  ladies and gentlemen they are going to phase out the cash for the little
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.200]  people uh banks will still deal in it for their
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.680]  money laundering operations but that'll all be uh selectively enforced and
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.760]  that's why they want to shut down online swap meets and
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.080]  barter systems that's why the feds without even passing a wall last year
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.080]  change the regulations talking about million dollar fines for your garage
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.840]  sale if you don't get a license or pay your taxes
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:28.400]  and all these new enforcers out there chasing people around
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:33.360]  controlling every facet of their lives the animal
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.200]  id the premise society i see articles every two or three days where they're
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.040]  setting up police checkpoints and running stings against people selling
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.280]  raw milk or or or farm fresh eggs uh people are
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:49.280]  being rated for tax reasons or uh permit reasons selling
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.600]  watermelons and squash and peaches on the side of the road
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.440]  you live in a prison america is a giant
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:04.320]  prison so of course the system is upset of course and
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.480]  they know the american people are upset but they've almost got their control
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.200]  grid in place they've almost got the north american union in place they've
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.360]  almost got their war with iran being a done deal
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.040]  and they're so close to it right now and they're so
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:24.240]  excited about it uh but the pressure against them is mounting
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.080]  faster than they thought it would and that's why brzeznik brzezinski panicked
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.840]  and that cfr televised speech and said look the whole world's awake to us
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.080]  our world government's in trouble because it is in trouble
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.680]  and so they're trying to hide everything in plain view that's why they come out
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.360]  and say yeah we're taking your baby's blood at birth for secret database
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.360]  uh yeah we're watching your kids at home with government-issued laptops
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:51.760]  yeah we're trending your kids to spy on you
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.920]  yeah we're growing the opium in afghanistan
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.440]  on and on and on they just come right out in the open now
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.000]  yeah we're setting up a world government yeah google does work for the nsa
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.480]  and was set up by the cia nsa and nasa of all groups
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.280]  and the entire operating system is uh you know the basic search function is
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.680]  just an nsa keyword search system developed 35 years ago
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.840]  and and upgraded and yeah those mobile trucks they are nsa
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.720]  google contractors uh contracting for nsa and and they are driving around
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.160]  tracking all your wireless connections and everything you're doing and
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.640]  yeah that's just the way it is mm-hmm and yeah google is watching you at home
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.560]  over them built-in cameras on your laptops and computers and cell phones
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.920]  and yeah we're listening to everything you're doing and we're using keyword
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:45.280]  software for that too see how five years ago paul
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.720]  watson wrote the articles off a google press release
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:52.240]  where they admittedly are watching you in your home right now
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:56.720]  with a computer the computer recognizes a dog barking and then you get ads
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:02.320]  for dog food that's how they fund the tyranny but that's only secondary
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.000]  they always fund their control grid uh what eight years ago
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.560]  usa today reported scoff claws get nabbed ordering pizzas
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.880]  and talked about how the big pizza companies have a private company
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:19.680]  they get 25 of the fines and fees knowing that when you call the real credit card
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:23.680]  or with your real name and address uh then it goes into a database guilty until
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.960]  proven innocent tracking everywhere you are everything you're doing slaves
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.520]  and they're upset by ron paul and rand paul and others they're upset that
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.400]  specter has been thrown out in the primary and that other
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.800]  establishment people are are are are losing in utah and everywhere else
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.880]  and that's why they have this headline conspiracist alex jones
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.960]  rand paul is awesome now i noticed this article this morning just said alex
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:54.800]  jones rand paul is awesome they've added conspiracist i guess
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.160]  i guess uh the the the article wasn't vicious enough
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:02.160]  uh for them and i talked to this guy for about 20 minutes yesterday and he said
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.320]  i'm doing an article about fema camps in two weeks i want the proof
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:11.440]  and i laid it all out how all of america is a giant tracking grid how schools
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.440]  are basically prisons how we have the biggest
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.800]  prison population in the world four and a half million behind bars another three
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.360]  to four million in the criminal justice system
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.200]  how they had top off one and top off two and other drills where they'd practice
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.720]  locking citizens down and putting us in sports stadiums and the congressional
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.040]  hearings in the 80s on rex 84 for fema camps for political dissidents
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:34.880]  and the washington post in houston chronicle and wall street journal
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.080]  in the last five years all reporting on the massive
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.720]  you know giant contracts to halliburton to build fema camps in the
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:48.800]  um what was the other big issue the emergency centers act with permanent
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.480]  military base fema camps for during emergencies and for political
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.840]  dissidents i mean this is all out in the open
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.920]  and there's none of that in the article it's all about rand paul now maybe he
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:03.280]  is doing an article in two weeks and this is a separate rand paul article but
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.320]  he told me no this is an article for two weeks from now
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.840]  and he kept asking me does rand paul believe in the fema camps
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:13.600]  and i said well rand paul knows that big government always oppresses the people
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.400]  and that tyranny happens 99 of the time in history
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.600]  can you deny that uh mark benjamin and mr benjamin said no i really can't
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.520]  deny that uh and he he didn't like that mean of
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.720]  an article i've got to say i guess that's why they changed his headline this
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.920]  morning to make it sound a little more vicious but uh
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:38.880]  conspiracist or conspiracist alex jones rand paul is awesome
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:43.200]  so they're they got tv ads running in kentucky like he goes on the alex jones

[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.120]  does that mean if he goes on cnn he agrees everything cnn says alex jones the
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.600]  radio host who is closely identified with the
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.680]  patriot movement is thrilled with rand paul's republican primary victory in

[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:10.240]  com a jennon 21 alert immigration theater
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:15.440]  breaking down what's really behind the open borders
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.880]  going back to this article alex jones rampall is awesome salon
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:26.560]  a big publication i said if you're an establishment republican or democrat
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:32.320]  you are gone come november jones said the good news is that people are coming in
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.600]  from both parties who have met better track records
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.400]  and don't have these establishment pedigrees he also warned the media against
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.880]  smearing paul and you know the full quote was basically
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.640]  look you guys don't understand the people don't trust you anymore
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.000]  so when you attack somebody that actually makes people support them more
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.160]  but the quote he excised is he also warned the media against
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.680]  smearing paul the mainstream media doesn't understand
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.800]  they are out of bullets when the mainstream media wants to
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.600]  hurt rampall they should come out and endorse him
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.320]  which of course they won't do so i was mainly mocking the fellow
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.360]  not in a mean way just explaining to him the way things are
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.400]  and i went on when the establishment attacks someone it only empowers them
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.000]  paul has appeared on jones's show and the host
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.720]  has promoted his candidacy jones a fiery orator
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.680]  who pledges on yielding field to the constitution
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.800]  is riding a wave of neo militant populism
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:39.760]  sparked by perceived oh perceived big government excesses
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.720]  oh no they're just talking about arresting citizens for no reason and
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.520]  disappearing into a black hole they're talking about the end of free speech
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.560]  obama spent more money than all presidents before him combined
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.480]  no it's it's perceived even among his ideological kin
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:56.480]  however jones nurtures are perhaps overly active
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:01.680]  predilection for conspiracies particularly on the subject of 911
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.560]  like six of the 10 commissioners saying it's a fraud and a cover-up you mean
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.920]  like that on a recent segment of his radio show jones
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:11.840]  declared this nation is being criminally and unconstitutionally
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.360]  absorbed by private central banks that are looting every major country on the
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.800]  planet they will destroy borders destroy
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.840]  constitutions that protect private property and the
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.960]  right of self-defense this is the stated goal
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:33.040]  jones believes the u.s. government is involved in a decades-long conspiracy
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.640]  to imprison political dissenters in concentration camps
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:41.040]  that will be run by fema i don't believe i pointed him directly to
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:46.800]  the miami herald and the hearings on the fema camps for political
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.640]  dissidents he told me that he's never talked
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:53.200]  about fema camps with paul that i could remember
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.240]  i know they are concerned about the police state i know
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:59.760]  that they are concerned about so many of our liberties being lost he said a
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.240]  paul's campaign they know that if you have a big
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.080]  powerful government it always turns towards oppression
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:10.320]  but overall a pretty fair article compared to what we usually see
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:16.240]  uh... from the likes of salon
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.840]  but i did offer to send the guy all the documents but he seemed to be aware of
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:22.800]  it he knew about the john warren defense authorization act he knew about the
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.320]  emergency centers act he knew about the hearings in the 80s about rex
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.800]  84 he knew about the uh... violent belligerence
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.040]  act he knew about uh...
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:38.560]  the houston chronicle and others reporting on the halliburton contracts
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.600]  for fema camps for political dissenters i mean
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:45.760]  but he's he still said alex claims or alex thinks or
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.920]  alex and i don't think anything okay i'm stating facts here
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:53.040]  if i get up here on air and tell you sodium fluoride doubles your chances of
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.320]  bone cancer there's over a hundred studies when i say a hundred i'm just
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.800]  i'm just throwing a number out it's it's gotta be
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.320]  five hundred i mean it they have these studies since the thirties i mean it's
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.880]  just so many studies on bone cancer doubling
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:10.000]  it's even higher in men for some reason but overall a doubling
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.360]  and that's just one of the health effects i mean the the stinking bags of the
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.040]  fluoride they put in your water supply say deadly poison on it
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.640]  causes cancer attacks all the organs i mean i i'm reading
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:27.200]  the stinking bag okay oh just it's so frustrating
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.480]  but i shouldn't be frustrated people now know that
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.440]  you know if i say the the earth is round the media is going to call it a
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.720]  conspiracy theory it is not a conspiracy theory
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:42.080]  it is fact ladies and gentlemen it is a fact what is going on
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:49.440]  in this society look at this news markets plunge for third
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:54.240]  day on jitters over e u economy global stocks plunge for the third day in a row
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:57.440]  on growing fears that europe's financial crisis will hurt economic growth
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:01.360]  and lead to a wider market correction i'm concerned the markets are really out of
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:05.360]  control german finance minister wolf gain
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.960]  schnoble my pronouncing that right told financial times of london
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.640]  this is why we need really effective regulation in the sense of
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:15.760]  creating a properly functioning market mechanism
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:20.480]  and tarply agrees with what germany is doing they've put emergency controls
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.720]  on derivatives and on naked shorting because
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.160]  the big brokerage firms and banks the recipients of the bailout money from the
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:33.040]  crises they create are openly looting the markets right now
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.920]  they're openly in there trying to exacerbate this
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.240]  to consolidate power and reap a giant

[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.200]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.440]  including colloidal silver we must take immediate steps to assure a continuing

[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:29.440]  i dropped my children off i took my wife out to dinner
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:33.520]  and my mother had the rebroadcast on in the house and as i walk in the door

[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.240]  it's just it's the most
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:45.040]  the most catchy jingle i've ever heard i've got to say that
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.280]  getting into more serious uh subjects i want to get into his inside
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:52.160]  investigation onto what's really happening with BP
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:56.000]  when you guys reprint me the curtain memo article i know you did but i can't
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.560]  find it about cbs news reporting that BP
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:04.720]  contractors won't let people on public beaches to videotape the oil
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.400]  and this is an example of martial law and tyranny violating the press this is
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.200]  Obama's open press we're going to talk about that
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.000]  we're going to talk about the major political realignment with specter going
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.720]  down uh grayson the republican going down to rand paul
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:23.200]  other republican and democrat uh established from people going down
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.160]  the media has framed this as if the tea party movement
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:32.160]  is an anti-democrat thing but rick perry senator cornan and others were booed a
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.960]  year and a half ago here in texas at tea parties
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.560]  but the media has tried to make it a republican issue
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.920]  uh so that uh so-called left feels like they're not part of the political
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.000]  debate so they automatically are basically given the role of being pro
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.640]  establishment when we're all in this together
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:54.880]  uh so this this clearly shows a realignment and the system is panicking
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.720]  and they're trying to use rand paul as the figurehead to destroy him
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.400]  but as i told salon yesterday you are out of bullets
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.480]  in the mainstream media if you're an establishment republican or democrat
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.120]  you are gone come november jones said the good news is that people are coming
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:14.880]  in from both parties who have much better track records as constitutionalist
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.120]  uh and don't have these establishment pedigrees
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:20.400]  he also warned the media against smearing paul the mainstream media doesn't
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.840]  understand they are out of bullets when the mainstream media wants to hurt
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:26.960]  rand paul they should come out and endorse him
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:30.320]  when the establishment attacks someone it only empowers them
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:33.440]  so we'll talk about that and what's happening in the markets
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:36.960]  uh with wane madson wane madson report dot com

[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:43.440]  because uh there's just a lot of stories about our current president and his
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:46.560]  uh for lack of a better term is cronies that have
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.320]  just gone unreported by the chicago papers which are basically been
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:55.360]  decimated with sam zeal uh that basically destroying the chicago trip and
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:58.400]  the sun time is not in very good shape and uh so i'm
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:03.520]  i'm going to be intermittently now in chicago uh from time to time to
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.240]  basically uh pick up the slack uh that uh the the few
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:12.400]  investigative journalists in this uh city can't get to a lot of these stories
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.360]  so i'm going to give them a give them a hand and just in a few days i've been
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:18.640]  here all i can say is the person who's in the white
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:22.720]  house who we all see is not the person who is the president
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.680]  believe you me well i mean weathermen corrupt poverty
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:35.040]  pimp slumlords mafia uh break down your research of barack
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.680]  obama i mean if this has got you out of dc uh in chicago
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:44.320]  we know this is big news what are you ferreting out on obama
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:50.080]  well uh let's just start with um uh the blagojevich trial it's it's very clear
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:54.800]  that blagojevich like many of his predecessors as governor
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.840]  governors of illinois there's been many who have been indicted and
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.680]  and uh many have gone to jail otto kerner and walker and
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.680]  and uh even blagojevich's predecessor republican george ryan
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:11.040]  um but when when we look at this case against blagojevich what we have is
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.040]  patrick fitzgerald who's a dirty us prosecuting attorney here
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:19.680]  in illinois cutting a deal with people like rama manuel
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:25.760]  and and obama put the attention on blagojevich only concentrate on
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:31.280]  certain segments of um of wiretap information don't listen to the other
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:36.560]  five you know 500 hours of wiretaps that would implicate mr obama mr
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.400]  uh mr immanuel and and others including alexia newland who's running for the
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:46.800]  us senate obama's good buddy who's bank broadway bank
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:51.520]  failed and and broadway bank made one of the it learns the initial loan to resko
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:55.760]  we know that resko put up the money for obama to buy this 500 000
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:00.400]  dollar home in hide park uh near the university of chicago which is not a
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:05.360]  bad section by the way of the south side so what we have is resko being
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.760]  indicted uh blagojevich being indicted and uh it it's very
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:12.800]  clear to me that those indictments should have also been served to rama
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:17.280]  manuel barack obama and potentially uh an individual
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.920]  who lost who gave voluntary voluntarily gave up her law license
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:27.200]  rather than face a major civil suit uh the records of the supreme court of
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:31.840]  illinois the disciplinary board had been sealed and uh the person who gave up
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:36.880]  uh voluntarily gave up her law license with michelle obama first lady
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:40.080]  you just made me have a double take there did
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:45.120]  did you say rama manuel and obama you believe have been served secret
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:48.320]  indictments no they should be they should be
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:52.560]  but the concentration of course by the general who was kept on bush's
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:58.560]  us attorney has been on blagojevich resko and the and the you know the fair game
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:04.480]  when in fact there should be uh if we had a decent us attorney here in
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:07.760]  northern illinois who was really interested in going after corruption
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:12.000]  we would we would actually if it was an honest us attorney we would have had
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.600]  indictments issued against obama rama manuel
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.960]  and and valery jarrett was his policy advisor
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:23.600]  and a number of the other uh cronies probably including the secretary
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:28.000]  of education uh arnie duncan all these people who are
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.760]  uh obama's friends and cronies and uh i should add that one of them of course
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:39.680]  is elena kagan who now has been uh uh uh nominated for the supreme court
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:43.440]  did they choose obama not just because he's good-looking and can read off a
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:46.560]  teleprompter well but because he's so compromised
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.880]  with all of these mafia connections well he's totally blackmailed uh we can
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:54.480]  look at the his history you know two years ago obama
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:00.320]  didn't have a ten dollars in his pocket to put gas in his uh gas tank of his car
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:04.960]  by the way he he had this car uh it was uh sold on ebay
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:10.400]  apparently god it only had 22 000 miles on it but even if it's 22 000 miles
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.880]  apparently the tires were so beat up uh i have to imagine this guy was peeling
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:19.840]  rubber on the streets of chicago running around town but you know
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.160]  here's a guy who's even his wife were being harassed by creditors
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:29.280]  uh credit card collection agency you know and you know they had three salaries
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:33.440]  his is illinois state senator uh his is a part time professor university
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:37.280]  chico and her salary and yet they couldn't make ends meet i mean
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:39.760]  how could if he couldn't pay his own bills then
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:44.160]  and maybe that's why he can't pay the country's bills today
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.360]  well he's admitted to drug use and there's a lot of evidence that he used a
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:50.400]  lot of hard drugs maybe that's why he didn't have money
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:55.440]  right and also there are reports of other extracurricular activities he
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:58.640]  engaged in here that well wane you've always got some of the best
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.600]  sources out there and uh it would be a big black male tool
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:06.800]  but i mean is there credible evidence you're starting to run into that he is
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.080]  bisexual uh yes um and uh it's it's it's no it's
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:17.200]  known uh here in chicago it's known among members of the african-american
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:22.400]  community uh and um uh let's just say i mean uh
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.480]  where was the media unfortunately the media the chicago media couldn't go
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.360]  very far on this because of what's happened to the
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.480]  many of the reporters at the chicago tribune have been laid off because of
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:36.400]  this this uh this uh slumlord uh real estate tycoon
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:40.240]  sam zell and of course the chicago sometimes
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:44.000]  basically up for grabs uh they've gone through a huge uh
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.200]  uh reduction in staff so you're there on this story
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:52.400]  uh shifting gears again what's the word in washington on alana kegan is she
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:55.520]  just somebody they're throwing out there with no judicial experience
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.200]  who's anti-free speech anti-second amendment knowing that she'll just take
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.760]  all the fire and then who they really want
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.920]  uh will come in after her or do you think they're really this arrogant to try to
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:09.760]  put her in no because you see who they're lining up
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:15.680]  they're lining up all the uh all the uh judicial experts and uh and bar
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:19.440]  association uh cronies are all saying oh she's so
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:22.560]  wonderful i think she's going to get in but see
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:26.640]  lubram johnson put a portis on the court but he had to finally step down because
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.280]  he got implicated uh in in all kinds of scandals uh and crony
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.280]  crony deal and she's involved and she's involved with goldman sacks up to her
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:38.400]  eyebrows yeah but see they know that today you
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:42.320]  can't get rid of somebody on the court but like they did a portis because once
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:46.560]  they're there now you know that you could get them for uh evidence of being an
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:50.400]  axmer and it would probably take uh it would probably be impossible to get them
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.480]  off the court now the media needs to go ahead and
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:59.120]  bring out the fact that she is a lesbian uh so that they can't use that
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.200]  against her for blackmail later i mean isn't it important for her
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:07.200]  to come out with her sexuality i mean how controlled is the media that only
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.200]  cbs news is reported on this yeah i mean the media is totally
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:14.640]  controlled and you know the people in the in the legal community
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:18.800]  who are coming to her defense and praising her uh look this is part of the
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:22.720]  whole inside the dc um mentality you know you
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:27.040]  you scratch my back i scratch yours and and obviously this is what was going on
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:32.240]  here in chicago uh with with uh with her here um
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.000]  uh if she was associated with the city for many years with the university of
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:39.600]  chicago she clerk clerk for admiral mcbinan you know
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:44.640]  the this us judge as far as they're concerned here walks on water so
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:49.440]  you know if he says she's good you know everybody falls in the place
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:56.240]  okay uh let's look at the economy uh in free fall markets down worldwide
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:00.640]  uh the euro endangered of collapsing uh what's your research on where this is
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:03.200]  going well i think i think we're seeing a
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.760]  meltdown uh certainly uh you know we saw what happened in
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:11.200]  thailand where there was a tianamen square uh
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:15.600]  style massacre the uh the farmers who came in who were very upset about
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.920]  what's going on uh in that country with more money going to the elite
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:23.040]  uh my prediction there that is thailand will now
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.080]  uh be engaged in a full-scale civil war with the
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:30.560]  the hat not uh going after the haves especially in the
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.000]  smaller cities and in the rural areas uh greece uh
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.520]  there's market they're marching on the parliament today they again are trying
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:41.680]  to take it over uh with uh the deals worked out with spain and
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:45.680]  portugal and there was an attempt to storm the irish parliament a few weeks
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.440]  ago uh iceland uh not uh you know the people there
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.400]  are not going to pay for that i think people just had no we
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.080]  no we hear sarcosi threatening to pull out of the euro murkel
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:00.800]  banning um naked short selling in germany i think maybe some of these
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:04.400]  leaders are starting to hear the message uh they should have heard it earlier
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.400]  on but i think they're worried i think the reason
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:09.440]  they're taking these actions is they're very worried about
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:13.120]  what they're seeing on the streets you know um shopping malls going up in
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.880]  flames and in in bangkok banks being bombed in Athens
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:22.080]  uh um and you know people uh marching uh banks being bombed in canada
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.360]  banks being fire bombed in canada right right
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.240]  and uh and and now we see the gulf of mexico turning into a dead zone
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.480]  and uh i just wonder how long it's going to take for uh people to reach that
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:38.240]  level of frustration here i would note that the um more people filed for
[01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:43.200]  unemployment last month than previously so obama's uh all his uh
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.800]  uh uh about the unemployment coming down is merely
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:53.360]  uh merely rhetoric and not even true well going back to domestic uh
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.160]  developments and we're going to come back and talk about your research in the
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:00.400]  story you've got out about bp and the admitted cover up there i mean every
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:03.120]  day they admit it was worse than what they originally said and they knowingly
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.080]  lied uh but rand paul winning the primary in
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:10.160]  kentucky by 30 plus points the republican incumbent losing in the
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.440]  primary in utah uh specter going down uh
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:19.680]  zbigniew brzezinski coming out on video and saying the the world has never been
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:22.560]  this awake to our world government we are in
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:27.280]  trouble to the cfr i mean they are not invincible are they
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:31.360]  uh no and i think what they're saying as i said as i said you know when
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.120]  people are getting uh you know thousands tens of thousands of people
[01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:39.600]  hit the streets that go on general strikes uh uh we're sitting in all over
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:45.600]  um europe and in asia uh we remember the food riots a few years ago popping up
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:50.080]  in in places like haiti and in africa we may see that happen again
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:55.040]  uh but this is something where the the have not and there's increasingly more
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:59.920]  have not than there are the elite have and i think uh i think they're
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.160]  worried they have good reason to be worried uh
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:06.160]  and uh what now they did all again the gulf coast being decimated
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:09.680]  as it was and they were just coming back from katrina they wouldn't you know
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:14.320]  never get back to where they were and now this happens and we find out that
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:18.080]  the the white house the coast guard janet napolitano
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.280]  uh head of the homeland security that controls the coast guard
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.840]  are engaged in this massive cover up and providing cover for bp and i have a
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.800]  story out today there's a bp expanded its
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.040]  refinery uh down here on lake michigan and ham in indiana
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:37.280]  uh they made promises that offset increased pollution in the lake
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:40.880]  they would take certain steps uh fund uh mitigate
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:45.440]  pollution mitigation uh on other for other plans on lake michigan they never
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:48.560]  did this and they and at least jackson who's a promise
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:52.000]  e p administration administrator has done nothing
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.120]  to hold bp's feet to the fire what i'm told here
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:58.640]  is that what this will stay there stay there we gotta break come back and tell
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:00.960]  us on the other side a lot more wane madson
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:04.480]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.240]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:11.760]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:14.480]  silver or gold it's true seeds have outperform even
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.440]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.000]  happen again so our friends at solutions from

[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:20.000]  investigative journalist you were uh getting down to the bottom line
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.960]  with what's happening with bp uh they've got this plant that they've expanded
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.640]  on like michigan it's processing heavy canadian crude
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:32.640]  they have reneged on all the promises they made to the court
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:38.000]  when the environmental groups up here sued bp the courts of course
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.760]  like many would found in their favor but said they promised they would
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:47.200]  take mitigating uh they would do this mitigation to prevent
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.840]  other increased pollution from having an effect on like michigan but what i'm
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:56.240]  told here is that this happened refinery is an accident waiting to happen they
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:00.560]  have a record of safety violations environmental violations
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:03.920]  and at what's going on in the gulf of mexico today
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:08.320]  could easily happen to like michigan uh you know in fact uh
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.440]  all you know not only the city of chicago but all the other
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:16.560]  cities and towns on like michigan and um and the obama administration has done
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.680]  nothing bp administrator lisa jackson has done
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:23.440]  nothing to hold bp speed to the fire just like we're seeing
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:27.040]  them provide cover for them in the gulf and i would note that
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:31.920]  but when uh this issue came up uh with the expansion of the refinery and have
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:37.520]  in indiana bp was caught while they were taking full page ads out in papers
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:41.600]  defending its position defending the plant defending its request for a permit
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:45.600]  to expand the plant but it was also found out they were paying internet
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:49.600]  bloggers to go out and trash any body who
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:53.520]  criticized this expansion of the plant and i would note that that's going on
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:57.680]  right now with people who are including myself people are reporting
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:01.360]  what the government's covering up in the gulf of mexico bp is paying
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:04.400]  internet bloggers and their sponsoring website
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:09.600]  to attack any information that runs counter to their uh to their pr department
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:13.360]  well that was my next point is have you seen the cbs news piece it's up on
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:16.560]  info wars dot com i have and and this is no
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.520]  because what i reported is the coast guard is part of the problem you know
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:22.800]  it's part of the homeland security department under nopalatano
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:26.640]  the coast guard uh is basically covering uh for
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:31.600]  uh bp uh on orders of of nopalatano but this is
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:35.040]  really irritating people that i'm hearing from with the army corps of
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:39.440]  engineers and and believe it or not fema it comes out smelling like a rose here
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:43.280]  fema is really upset that what they're seeing with the noah
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:47.600]  uh and the coast guard uh and the epa covering up for
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.800]  what they've seen as a huge disaster and well for those who just joined us
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:56.320]  all over the gulf coast if anybody tries to go up
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:01.520]  including cbs news with video cameras on public beaches to show the oil
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:05.600]  armed men come up and say get out of here i mean this is not america and going
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:08.080]  back three years ago a few years after katrina
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:11.280]  greg palace of the bbc was working for abc on the story
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:14.080]  he went and showed one of these fema facilities that was
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:19.360]  holding people you know in these trailers of these emergency communities
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:23.360]  and palace tried to videotape that was right next to a chemical dump
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.120]  and they put out an arrest warrant for him that got retracted
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.160]  for for terrorism for violating national infrastructure security so if
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:35.360]  we're wondering where the government's going under the patriot act
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:38.720]  they are using it to cover up real environmental problems
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:44.080]  and you know that cbs video that footage the two coast guard guys uh just tell
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:50.400]  tell cbs uh the cbs proof uh we're following bp rules here we're under bp
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:54.080]  well since when did the coast guard take orders from bp
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:57.920]  i thought it was the other way around so i think this is further
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:03.040]  proof of what's happening with uh with corporate fascism in this country
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.720]  it's incredible i mean all over the nation you'll try to videotape
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:10.720]  uh you know a police car from 100 yards away they'll come over and say turn
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:14.320]  your camera off and arrest you or you try to show what bp's doing you know
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.840]  they threaten to arrest you i mean it's it's just no first
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:21.120]  amendment and you got kagan who openly says she
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:23.920]  doesn't believe in the first amendment they're like oh great
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:27.440]  another golden sacks crook this is who we need is the new supreme court justice
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:31.120]  i mean this is tyranny on every front i want to hit a few other issues with
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:34.080]  wane madson on other big stories he's working on

[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:47.120]  i was asking you during the last break i that you know could this be what
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:50.720]  unravels obama and you said absolutely that's why i'm here
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:53.920]  and uh... you were saying the conventional wisdom on the street is
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:56.640]  he's not going to be running for reelection and we've even had howard
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:00.080]  dean coming out saying he may run and that they may run other democrats
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.680]  against him so the bigger uh... they are the harder they fall they built this
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:07.040]  guy up like it was the second coming of of christ
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:11.840]  uh... but boy i tell you he is he is crashing and burning
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:16.480]  what's your take on that way well obama obama walked in in the last campaign
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:17.680]  without any kind of
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:21.760]  uh... checks uh... you know there was a he was a rock star and he
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.600]  he glided in and he didn't really take much in the way of any barb
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:29.200]  uh... but this next time he will and michelle knows that
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:33.520]  uh... they didn't have much money when he uh... uh... was in the illinois state
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:35.920]  senate he's he's made all kinds of money now
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:40.080]  and apparently her thinking is if they would leave the cut and run
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:43.680]  now they could make more money uh... as the next president
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:47.040]  uh... then bill clinton even made and that's what they may be looking for the
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:47.440]  heat
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:52.000]  uh... obama's got a huge ego and he really does not uh... take criticism very
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:52.640]  well
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:56.640]  he may elect and we might hear well and you know for my family my children
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:59.360]  uh... this is i would you know another campaign uh...
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.880]  uh... it's going to be too tough but then come up with something now from your
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:06.960]  sources is he bisexual or is the uh...
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:11.120]  what i call that hollywood is his wife and kids a beard
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:14.560]  uh... well it would be a good the white would be a beard uh... uh...
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.480]  absolutely would be a beard uh...
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:21.520]  it would be a good good scandal here with the republican candidate for senate
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:22.560]  uh... current
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:24.720]  uh... now being out of this part of this
[02:02:24.720 --> 02:02:28.640]  a gay ring along with dennis hastert mark foley so
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:32.720]  you know it's a little bit in both parties in this in this day absolutely i
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.440]  mean i don't know that it's gay people but why is it
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:38.560]  in roamer anywhere else when when in the decline
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:40.560]  it becomes like a guild
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:43.360]  and the only people they're outing are the are the straights
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:47.200]  you know the problem with curkins he's a he's apparently a naval reserve officer
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:48.480]  navy intelligence
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:52.000]  so here we go with not only the don't ask don't tell the issue but also
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.280]  highly blackmailable now he wants to be the united states senator
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:00.640]  of filling obama's old feet from illinois
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:06.080]  so you predict curtains for obama unless they launch an iran war or
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:09.360]  what's your intel on how the establishment is going to try to
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:12.400]  try to finesse and finagle their way out of this
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:16.560]  i think they could launch an iran war and also uh... can you know say to obama
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:18.240]  you know what's what you know
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:21.680]  go ahead go make a lot more money than bill clinton and uh... will will have
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:23.520]  another person will invest it
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:26.480]  i you know bring in as the uh... presidential candidate
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:29.600]  and again folks wayne madson doesn't just say things he's one of our best
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:30.960]  sources of info
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:33.600]  and this is just incredible coming from you i guess because you're there but
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:34.720]  doing the research
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:36.640]  uh... that uh...
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:41.040]  because if he is a completely homosexual my god he is so blackmailed
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:42.000]  didn't he
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.840]  right he is and remember i supported obama but i i put myself in the
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:47.280]  category of people
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:50.880]  didn't do their job properly uh... and investigate them but
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:53.760]  but the the the secrets were all here in chicago
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:57.440]  and uh... and uh... there was just so many
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.680]  stories and so few people on the dig at dig deep on them and uh...
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:05.360]  uh... because as i mentioned the chicago newspapers that basically been
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:06.560]  destroyed
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:10.000]  well you know bush was so bad you you would think
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.520]  anything could be better than it just gets worse and i think it's the the
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:14.640]  the establishment
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:17.680]  has committed so many crimes why not commit a million more
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:20.560]  uh... do you agree with me that there all their chips are in though i mean the
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:21.520]  establishment
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.360]  is going for broke
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:26.960]  well i think that when you know it's like that you know a wild animal when
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:28.720]  when cornered or treed
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:32.880]  uh... that they lash out and i think that's exactly what these people
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:35.760]  uh... are capable of doing that we don't know
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:39.120]  uh... what do you know they still have a lot of influence they still have a lot
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:39.920]  of power
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:43.440]  what they're capable of and certainly starting a war would be something
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:46.560]  uh... they they've opted for that in the past it would operate again in the
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:47.440]  future but
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:51.600]  i think that maybe that people around the world are a little wise to their
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:56.000]  absolutely wayne madson report dot com wayne thanks for coming on god bless you

[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:49.040]  william hagg george osborne hey it must be difficult for lating satan all day

[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:32.000]  well it was about a year ago that we had charlie uh beach on
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  with us and back then he had to start of the love
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.760]  police kind of like we are chains or info wars uh groups
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.880]  it's like british tea party and they just go out to public events and show the
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:49.280]  police state and confront globalist uh there he was confronting the new
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:55.920]  british prime minister david cameron and shutting down their press conference
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:10:00.480]  and it's another example of the effect you can have by just confronting
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:04.880]  these people with the truth and the facts they've been arrested for videotaping
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:07.760]  they've been arrested for publicly speaking they've been
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:11.200]  locked up by security guards they've been harassed
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:14.960]  because england has become a police state two years ago they changed the law
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:18.400]  where you can't videotape in public or they arrest you as a terrorist but the
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:21.840]  government's going to watch you and track what you're doing
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:25.440]  and more and more of the media not just alternative media standing up and saying
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:32.560]  no we must resist these tyrants charlie it's uh good to have you on with us
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:36.640]  from the uk today hello alex how are things over in the state
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:40.720]  good good it's good to have you here uh so much is going on
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:45.440]  in the world today and we see incumbents being thrown out here in the u.s we see
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:50.560]  rioting starting all over the world we see the world financial market
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:55.040]  basically imploding uh tell us a little bit about yourself
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:59.120]  and and going from just somebody trying to you know shoot video in london being
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:03.840]  harassed out of now starting to love police that's starting to catch on
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.280]  yeah absolutely alex as you said once in one of your speeches i have an
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:12.080]  infinite human spirit which refuses to submit i'm just one human being and i
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:15.280]  hate what's happening to my country which masquerades
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:18.480]  as a free country so as you say i'm just one guy with a camera with a
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:21.920]  megaphone that goes out there to try and expose it and what we like to say we
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:25.200]  like to um point the camera up the um
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:28.320]  the rear end of evil and just show people that there's nothing to be scared
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.600]  of these are pathetic and lonely and sad individuals
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:35.120]  who have no love in their hearts who just want to control others and
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:39.440]  not on my watch it's just not going to happen as long as i'm around
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:43.280]  so when did you start to love police because you guys are really active
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:46.560]  and uh are gaining a lot of attention for good
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:52.640]  uh now on a weekly basis yeah started the love police almost exactly 13 months
[02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:56.240]  ago um it kind of happened a few days after i came on
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:59.120]  your show there's no connection there but i just started filming outside the
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:03.200]  american embassy which you saw and i lost my job i was working for one of the
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:06.320]  main banks in uh been britain called the halifax bank of
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:10.000]  scotland bank of scotland's a 500 year old institution
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.320]  and i lost my job in the recession so i was on the inside i saw myself selling
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:17.520]  investments and you know investing in companies which
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:22.640]  are war companies the big business party big war thing so i just i just when i
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:26.880]  lost my job the illusion shattered for me and i realized i wasn't really living
[02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:30.320]  a real human life and one thing i find alex is that when you do what's right
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:34.880]  the universe conspires to help you and i'm still alive i'm still going i'm i
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.160]  feel very happy doing what i'm doing because when you do what's right it
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:41.680]  feels automatically fun and i have to admit what i do with the camera and the
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:45.920]  megaphone is very good fun because i can't see myself doing anything else
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.720]  like you call your channel info wars and i believe we are in a war for people's
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:54.240]  consciousness it is a war for equality and what the
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:57.120]  the elites are trying to do the international financiers
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:00.320]  is to dehumanize everyone to the point where we don't even think that we
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.160]  should be allowed to live and i have friends my own friends close people to
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:07.920]  me who who who think we should wipe each other out who think that we need a
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:11.200]  virus to wipe us out and this is what i'm trying to fight against like
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.320]  the point of the love police is to lower fear and raise love
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:18.000]  and the best way to do that is to shine a light on these on these puppets and
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.000]  show the people the great masses that we have nothing to be scared of them
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:26.640]  and great evil things bring out the best in people and that's all i do
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:29.920]  well normally you are loving when you're just out in the middle
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:33.760]  of the street or on the sidewalk in london and police come over and say you
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:37.680]  can't film you can't talk to fellow
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:42.400]  people in england and and really illustrating just how out of control
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:46.000]  the police state is and i remember five years ago in england they started
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.400]  putting tracker rfid chips in the trash bins
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:54.000]  now that's coming to virginia and texas and california
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.600]  i remember five six years ago remote control thermostats
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.360]  in people's homes in england where the government tracks everything you do in
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:04.080]  controls your thermostat now that's coming
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:08.960]  here to the united states the police taking dna at checkpoints
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:12.400]  started six seven eight years ago in england now that's coming
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:17.680]  here so england is always five six seven years depending on what issue
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:21.200]  ahead of us england the last five years has started
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:25.040]  making people take satellite tracker boxes in their cars to tax them by the
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:28.320]  mile in many cities or using the license plates
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:32.000]  to turn regular roads into toll roads with license plate
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.400]  identification systems uh... you know the secret arrest of citizens
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:40.240]  government terror i mean you know the the center of one of the most wicked
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:43.920]  empires on earth being the british empire that model
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:47.760]  according to carol quickly at georgetown bill clinton's mentor is the british
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:50.640]  empire model not so much the british empire itself
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:53.920]  though it is now bigger in the banking system than even new york
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.400]  uh... but the system you know it's not the irish or the scottish or the english
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:01.200]  that are bad it's it's not the american people that are
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:03.120]  bad it's not the mexican government
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:06.400]  uh... the the mexican people that are bad it's the mexican government that's
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:09.760]  bad it's not the chinese people that are bad it's the chinese government
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:13.440]  that's bad uh... because in history governments tend to be ruthless and
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:16.160]  controlling and there's no doubt they're working together
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:20.240]  to bring in this world tyranny against we the people so break down
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:24.720]  the transformation in your lifetime of what the uk has turned into
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:28.000]  as a warning to the rest of the world because you were definitely sitting
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.160]  in the orwellian airstrip one the model for the rest of the globe
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:36.000]  yeah we are the airstrip for america and the british cabal to launch their
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.440]  operations around the world uh... what i've seen in my lifetime
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:43.040]  is uh... just in the last five ten years the
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:48.160]  incredible cctv control the cameras all over london that you can't walk around
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:51.680]  london without getting filmed by at least three hundred cameras
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:54.960]  and uh... one thing we always try and see the love police if they can film us
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:58.880]  surely we can film them if they're going to be tracking us we can track them we
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:01.360]  can bother them it works both ways and
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:05.200]  you know we are strong human beings and we will not accept this
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:09.520]  total control and it is a nanny state it's people trying to tell us what to do
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:12.960]  and i personally alex i am a philosophical anarchist
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:17.200]  and i think government is totally the problem in the world is awakening now
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:20.240]  to a point where we will not need these antiquated
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:23.280]  control system so as your last caller said yeah they're going to throw
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:26.640]  everything at us now to try and control us and make us scared
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:30.560]  you see them crisscrossing the skies with all sorts of nasty pollutants
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:33.680]  they're putting all these horrible chemicals in our on our food and water
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:36.800]  but it doesn't help them brazinski is terrified of us
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:40.000]  he knows that there is some special quantum force in the universe which will
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.280]  help people if you just do what's right so what we have
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:47.040]  is just a few years to kind of try and wake everyone else up but coming back
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:49.200]  to your question what i've seen in the last
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:54.080]  few years is now we have private police forces we have private employees with
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:57.760]  police powers patrolling the streets the train stations the
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:01.840]  the airports and they answer to a corporate boss and as benita musolini
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:05.040]  the italian fascist dictator said the corporate state
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:09.600]  is the fascist state and it is very evident in london right now alex
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:14.960]  well i've got three articles today what census workers raping people attacking
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:18.080]  people with with attack dogs they bring to the door
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:22.080]  now as part of their petty power trip census workers who are convicted
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:25.120]  pedophiles the government knew the guy was a pedophile in
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:29.360]  hiring uh more and more the tsa workers are robbing
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:34.720]  people raping women uh going crazy and announcing i'm god i'm god now
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:38.640]  several of them have just had complete delusions of grandeur
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:42.080]  believing their god they're they're also taking all these dumb
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:46.320]  down fluoride heads uh who've been watching television their
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:49.360]  whole life who you know who literally have shriveled
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:53.680]  brains uh and giving them power and that's what's even more
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:57.600]  sickening about tyranny it's not just the far off elitist robbing you but
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:01.920]  you've got to put up with lesser men and women who can't get a real job
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:05.680]  who are petty you know a real man is ashamed to exercise
[02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:09.840]  undue power on people uh and to make people grovel
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:14.640]  but but but petty scum can find a million positions
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:18.880]  in this archipelago of control freak uh behavior
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:24.400]  and so tyranny is a wonderland uh of of corruption and
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:27.040]  then the government with taxpayer money gets to decide
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:31.840]  what films get made and and what the people see i mean it's a bunch of scum
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:36.800]  playing god and i am just not gonna let a bunch of pedophiles with machine guns
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:40.480]  run my life and uh alex you're absolutely right about the
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:44.240]  the pedophile thing at the top it's uh it's exploding now in scotland with a
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:48.640]  case of a girl with down syndrome the the scottish elite the legal and police
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:51.760]  and government elite there was a pedophile cabal
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:55.440]  abusing a a disabled young girl called holly greg
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.440]  well how many and we've covered that but how many homeland security state heads
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:03.440]  have been caught being pedophiles i mean we have to understand how do you get
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:09.120]  people that'll steal bank accounts rob torture lie listen to people illegally
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:12.480]  do that well because they're criminals some are money launderers some drug
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:17.520]  dealers but most of them are perverts and and and with that's what we face is a
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:21.200]  legion of potbellied perverts with automatic weapons
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:24.240]  but the good news is the police and the military
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:27.200]  are starting to wake up here are you seeing some of the police wake up in
[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:31.120]  your area massively alex the times i get arrested there's
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:35.440]  always a few policemen in the station that come to my cell shake my hand tell
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:38.160]  me i'm doing great work that they are also concerned
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:40.880]  there are good people in the military there's good people in the police and
[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:44.320]  the job of the love police is to communicate with as many police as
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:47.760]  possible in london give them hugs remind them of their humanity and also
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:50.160]  remind them what kind of world that they're going to be bringing in for
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:54.000]  their children and grandchildren so it's not just a resistance thing it's also
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.600]  a reminder to people of just how glorious and special they are and then we're all
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:20:01.040]  humans we're all humans and we shouldn't serve the potbellies
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:04.240]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:08.560]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:12.800]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:16.800]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:20.720]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:24.400]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:28.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.840]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:35.440]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:39.360]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:41.760]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:44.880]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:12.800]  gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job

[02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:19.920]  that social security would be there for you that's not what's happening
[02:21:19.920 --> 02:21:24.480]  you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:28.400]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure

[02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:40.800]  and and dealing with some of the state banks around the country
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:45.280]  this is a short segment though charlie we've got a bunch of these videos we

[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:14.400]  resistance is victory absolutely alex i think one thing is
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:18.320]  important for people to know you know the film the matrix how there's a neo the
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:21.680]  character played by keanu reeves that's an anagram of the one
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:25.120]  and when you everyone realizes that they are the one they have that connection
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:29.200]  to the source themselves to whichever religion or spirituality you believe in
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:32.560]  you are an infinite power and you have nothing to be scared of from these
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:36.960]  pathetic controlling tyrants and one thing we like to do at the
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:40.080]  love police is to put these videos out there we never force people to watch
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:44.640]  them but it just shows people that you can do this and survive and be happy and
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:48.240]  have a great life just by being a decent human being and to me being a decent
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:52.240]  human being is standing up against anyone who attempts to
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:56.720]  destroy and poison my fellow human beings and including me
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:00.400]  for many years i was living under the mass hypnosis illusion that
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:03.280]  things were okay i was a big believer in the mainstream media
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:07.120]  i even joined the armed forces after september the 11th for the british army
[02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:11.040]  because i wanted to go out there and kill terrorists because i believed it
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:14.880]  and you don't know how upset and angry i am and i'm not sure yet i'll be able to
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:18.480]  forgive those people who lied to me and who lied to all those other
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:21.840]  young men and women who joined the armed forces thinking they're fighting for
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:27.760]  for freedom when in fact they're fighting for haliburton what woke you up
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:34.080]  um who i think it was a combination of luck in that i lost my job i didn't
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:37.520]  quit i was i just lost my job because the economy went bad
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:40.720]  and i've always been a bit of a rebel since a young age you know i never
[02:26:40.720 --> 02:26:45.600]  really uh listened to authority as very anti-authoritarian but i think it was
[02:26:45.600 --> 02:26:49.200]  just maybe what um people like uh david ike talk
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:52.960]  about there is a general vibrational change happening in the world as
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:57.360]  brazil's he says a general awakening and i'm just lucky that it came to me
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:01.840]  before i got sent out to iraq to go and uh shoot innocent people
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:06.240]  absolutely i mean here's an example did you see that video two weeks ago three
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:09.520]  weeks ago out of pennsylvania where it says we're
[02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:14.880]  watching you tom nice house nice car tom you owe the state three thousand
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:17.440]  dollars we know where you are we're coming to get you
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:21.040]  and i'm seeing articles every day of people losing their houses
[02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:26.160]  for parking tickets or for water bills and everybody i know who
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:28.960]  who is not doing well financially all over the country
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:33.040]  is getting calls now where collection agencies for the government are
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:36.800]  threatening you with jail if you don't pay them
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:40.720]  uh the the taxes are all going up but the infrastructure is falling apart
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:43.520]  because almost all the money is going to the bankers like it's
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:47.760]  nigeria or argentina and here's one out of the huffington post
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:51.840]  woman's home confiscated over small water bill
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:56.560]  they now take your house over a 362 dollar bill
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:00.480]  i mean if this isn't tyranny i don't know what it is
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:04.000]  it is total tyranny and well but one thing i can say i'm always an optimist
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.760]  alex i like to always look on the bright side but these mistakes they made this
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:11.920]  tyranny they impose it wakes up people are much more accelerated pace
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:14.960]  and what i think it's the bankers that caused this financial crisis and if
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:18.480]  it's the bankers trying to take your house what people need to do on mass
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:22.160]  is start barricading themselves you know getting themselves able to
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.560]  mount a defensive front against anyone who attempts to come to their house and
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:30.240]  pick them out and i i also think um people need to start
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:32.560]  stand together was actually a writer from um
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:36.560]  soviet russia called solish nitsyn and he said that when they were coming
[02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:39.440]  round for the mass roundups of political dissidents
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:43.520]  what he says is that they didn't value freedom enough people should have set up
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:48.800]  ambushes in staircases using baseball bats or hammers or pots and pans and
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:53.360]  he said that if people did a massive rise up that the state does not have enough
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:57.840]  thugs to round up hundreds of thousands of people if a few hundred of them are
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:00.880]  starting to fight back yeah guys print me the alexander

[02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:14.880]  well it's outrageous calderon has now given his speech to the congress i have
[02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:17.600]  the text of it paul watson has an article up on
[02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:22.560]  prisonplanet dot com he attacked the second amendment
[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:26.560]  not only is a foreign dictator who wasn't elected that's on record
[02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:31.120]  who set up a total police state a narco terrorist state that's waging a war
[02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:33.440]  against other cartels that aren't laundering money
[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:38.640]  through uh... u.s banks not only is he here telling 30 million illegal aliens
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:42.080]  to politically rise up in our country a foreign leader
[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:45.520]  with a group of people that see themselves as foreigners he now wants
[02:33:45.520 --> 02:33:48.080]  our second amendment and is blaming violence
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:52.720]  in his repressed country where no citizen can own guns
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:59.920]  on our second amendment and we are defeating the establishment right now
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:04.880]  peacefully with political information that's why cast sunstein and kagan
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:08.400]  and all these globalists are saying censor the internet censor free speech
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:13.280]  shut us down because they can't get away with this if our voices are being heard
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:17.840]  and so they're now coming out conditioning and acclimating and in
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:22.560]  testing the water sending up trial balloons to openly shut down free speech
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:25.600]  and every time the media calls me you know they say are you causing violence are
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:30.080]  you going to cause violence which we're we're speaking out against violence
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:34.640]  but but what does it lead to when they say we're going to start arresting you
[02:34:34.640 --> 02:34:38.800]  and disappearing you into a gulag or worse
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:42.880]  and no one will even know we took you i mean that's in the legislation that's
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:46.800]  being promoted and then it leads us to the point
[02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:50.160]  of when the secret police are coming to drag you away
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:53.360]  then people are going to be forced to physically resist
[02:34:53.360 --> 02:34:56.240]  that's why oathkeepers is so important that's why we're reaching out to
[02:34:56.240 --> 02:35:02.160]  military and police right now like our lives depend on it because they do
[02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:04.960]  listen to this this is the alexander schultz and eason
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:09.040]  won the nobel prize ronald reagan praised him for anybody demonizing him
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:13.120]  again this is somebody praised by our government of course that was 25 30 years
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:18.480]  ago not anymore he's demonized now and how we burned in the camps later
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:21.200]  thinking what would things have been like if every
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:24.400]  security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:28.080]  had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:31.200]  his family or if during periods of mass arrest
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:35.280]  as for example in leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:38.320]  some estimates are almost half but that was in one period
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:42.400]  or if during periods of mass arrests as for example in leningrad
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:45.920]  when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people had not simply sat
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:50.560]  there in their layers pawling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:54.720]  at every step on this staircase but had understood that they had nothing left to
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:58.720]  lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:02.320]  an ambush of a half dozen people with axes hammers pokers
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:05.760]  or whatever else they had at hand the organs
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:09.520]  would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers in transport and
[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:13.600]  notwithstanding all of stalin's thirst the cursed machine would have ground to
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:18.640]  a halt if if we didn't love freedom enough
[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:23.840]  and even more we had no awareness of the real situation
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:27.760]  we purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:34.560]  alexander schultz and aidsen so here's the article it's up at info wars dot com
[02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:39.360]  prism planet dot com it's also a gcn live dot com
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:43.280]  this is up at gcn live dot com it's pointing this article out to everyone
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:49.280]  dictator of failed state lectures americans about freedom
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:53.920]  dear mr calderon get the hell out of the u.s that is the subheadline i had
[02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:57.680]  watson right by paul joseph watson and alex jones we wrote this together this
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:00.880]  morning americans were once again forced to endure
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:03.760]  the dictator of a failed state was which represses
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:07.040]  and subjugates its citizens as a matter of course lecturing
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:10.640]  the u.s about how his people were being discriminated against
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:14.880]  yesterday when unelected mexican president felipe calderon
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:18.560]  bashed the arizona illegal immigration law calderon
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:23.680]  commented such laws as an arizona law is forcing our people to face discrimination
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:26.800]  during a white house meeting calderon later attacked the second amendment to
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:30.880]  speech to the u.s congress get out of our internal affairs
[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:33.840]  quit using a political weapon against us this is treason
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:37.600]  this is sedition this is an invasion this is a foreign leader
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:42.880]  trying to invoke sedition in our country blaming mexico's spiraling drug violence
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:46.720]  on guns being smuggled from inside america though the study show over 90
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:49.200]  percent are being bought by the army and then sold
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:52.560]  while failing to mention the fact that the lax border security something the
[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:56.720]  vehemently supports but only on american borders is the primary
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:00.320]  cause of the problem and he says calderon's use of the
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:03.040]  term our people is a slap in the face of every american every
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.680]  hispanic american who has immigrated legally
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:09.760]  since when did the leader of a foreign nation address his own constituency
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:13.600]  from within an entirely different country
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:16.720]  if the millions of illegal aliens living in america see themselves as mexicans
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:20.240]  then why do they insist on staying in the u.s illegally well because they say
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:23.200]  this is mexico well but if the mexican system so good
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:27.120]  why don't you stay in mexico then now expanding on that we played a video
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:29.520]  clip earlier and i'm don't know if watson has this in the
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:33.520]  article where obama said we've gone past our borders
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:38.720]  we're one country i mean that is treason going back to charlie
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:44.000]  veech of the love police uh... they're doing the same thing in england bringing
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:47.200]  in masses of foreigners who are just human beings too
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:51.440]  but then playing them off against the rest of the people in the country as a
[02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:56.640]  political weapon uh... and as a tool of balkanization what's your view on that
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:00.720]  absolutely i think i'm happy you brought that up because in many of my films
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:05.520]  uh... many of the commenters noticed how the most aggressive physically people
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:09.440]  are the non-native british and as you say they're human beings as well but these
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:14.480]  are people from rwanda or from sudan or from syria bosnia who went through a
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:17.680]  war a war zone and now they've been given a police
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:21.120]  community support officer with police powers uniform
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:24.000]  and they are violent i've never had a um...
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.200]  a native gentleman english man uh... police man
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:32.240]  hit me but i have had a security thugs from eastern europe and uh... from
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:37.040]  africa you know god bless them but they they don't let me just interrupt again i
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:39.920]  had a member of parliament on a few months ago and he admitted that
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:43.520]  over half of the cps workers kidnapping kids
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:46.480]  are foreigners as well who can't even speak english so
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:50.000]  we know what this is bringing foreigners give them uniforms
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.440]  make them the military and the police and they'll do whatever they're told
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:56.480]  absolutely alex and that one thing i think it's very important for me to say
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:00.080]  because a lot of my friends are are saying oh alex jones is a fearmonger
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:03.520]  alex you're not a fearmonger you give the information truthfully you work on
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:07.200]  fact and it's in the eye of the perceiver whether they are scared of it or not
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:11.360]  we are in a battle right now we are at the brink and self defense is very
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:13.600]  different from opens i just wanted to say that
[02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:17.680]  well it is scary to say there's a world government that plans to implode
[02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:21.440]  economies by design by selling fraudulent derivatives to government
[02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:24.960]  and then loaning the government's more fiat money it is scary they're putting
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:28.240]  poison in the water it is scary they launched two illegal wars are about to
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:31.600]  go into iran it is scary that they're setting up this
[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:35.920]  police state and bringing in foreigners to rule over us it is scary that tens of
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:39.120]  trillions have been stolen and the whole world is on the verge of financial
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:42.720]  collapse i mean again that's a childlike mind
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:46.400]  that thinks that i'm saying something so that creates the fear
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:49.760]  if i live in a valley at a huge dam breaks
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:54.080]  and the alarms go off saying get out you've got five minutes
[02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:57.520]  30 feet of fast moving water is coming it will kill you
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:00.800]  am i a fearmonger if i get on the radio of a dam broke
[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:05.440]  and told people get to high ground no you're not and were those people in the
[02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:09.680]  war saw jewish uprising were they fear mongers for telling the other jewish
[02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:12.960]  people that the nazis were coming to kill them were they fear mongers for rising
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:15.840]  up against the nazis in the last bid attempt to save their
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:18.800]  their lives and their friends lives no they're not they were just looking at
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:23.760]  the truth and acting as a decent you know as a kind of conscious human being
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:27.120]  should versus all the other footage we've seen
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:31.600]  of jewish families and others they'd separate the kids and send them off to be
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:35.120]  killed and they'd run the women into pits naked the men into pits
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:39.600]  and shoot them and the next group seeing them being hurted into be shot
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:43.040]  would still run right in like gentlemen to be killed
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:46.800]  that's not going to happen with me i'm not running into any pit
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:51.120]  i mean i mean at the moment of watching people's heads being and i saw footage
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:55.040]  from nigeria about two months ago in fact bermas has it were you asking to
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:58.000]  bring us that footage and they're bringing people in the middle of the
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:01.600]  town square having them lay down and then shooting them
[02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:05.840]  and these guys could have run they could have fought i mean i'm an extremist
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:09.920]  that that i'm saying i'm not going into a pit to be shot
[02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:15.840]  now david sorry alex yes i'm um i'm actually i spoke to a lady who ran for
[02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:19.840]  to be a member of parliament and she told me that i am on a domestic extremist
[02:42:19.840 --> 02:42:22.720]  list so i need to have a few days notice if there is
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:26.080]  going to be a roundup because they would round me up of course
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:29.840]  and just like you i would also do everything i could right now
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:34.240]  because in britain we do not have big trains taking people away to camps
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:38.480]  so right now the best way i can see us fighting this is just to raise awareness
[02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:42.480]  and raise the consciousness raise the humanity no they just slowly arrest
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:44.880]  people and then you get processed into the jail
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:50.080]  that's how this works now yeah it's very scary when we realize we are living
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:53.760]  in those um those crazy films that we never thought would come true but this
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:57.840]  is reality now this is actually happening and i wish people could see this
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:01.760]  and i wish people would stop projecting their own fears onto us
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:04.960]  saying that we are fear mongers for talking about this all we're doing is
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:09.440]  saying this isn't how it should be they're on the news in england and the u.s
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:13.120]  saying they want to be able to arrest us and there'd be no record of where we
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:16.240]  went and then we can even be tortured now that's bona fide
[02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:21.840]  oppression that's bona fide evil to the max and they're trying to sell it
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:26.800]  as if it's acceptable we must speak out against it and the good news is
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:29.920]  the people are starting to listen but i know rough as you go back to this point
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:33.600]  because i've been questioned in england if you even talked to anybody on the
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:36.160]  street that is criminal because you're all prisoners
[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:39.600]  steve watson's who lives in london it's happened to him going to a concert with
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:42.800]  his girlfriend uh they do this to everybody now and
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:47.760]  describe foreigners in uniform hitting you
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:50.800]  yeah i know it's uh it's a footage of this
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.400]  yeah i'm just just going through my mind all the different times when police
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:57.760]  have arrested me under a public order offense for
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:00.800]  talking about the connection between big business and war
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:04.400]  for talking about how only countries with oil seem to get invaded
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:08.400]  and the police lie they tell so many lies they say oh a member of the public is
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:11.920]  now offended so now we need to arrest you because you've offended someone it's a
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:14.720]  hate crime you know there's uh there's muslims here on
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:17.360]  the street and you're talking about a future war with iran
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:20.480]  we need to arrest you this could be a race hate crime and it's it's just
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:25.760]  ridiculous is george orwell's 1984 they arrested robin page seven years ago bbc
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:28.720]  reporter because he used the word homosexual in a speech
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:33.120]  they said that word is hateful and i mean this is real
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:36.880]  i know it's uh it blows my mind alex but all we need to do is just keep doing
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:40.560]  what's right with zero compromise and when you do what's right the universe
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:43.520]  will help you and for me what is right is defending freedom
[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:47.600]  it's defending that human spirit which will not bow down and i will not bow
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:50.320]  down before any other man because i'm a sentient
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:53.600]  free human being so they can bring all they want but it's not going to work
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:55.600]  with me and my job is just to make sure
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:59.520]  other people realize that they are free in their minds it's just the physical
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:02.480]  world which is the challenge and they need to make sure they're free in the
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:06.320]  physical world as well well i mean look at how
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:11.680]  5000 years ago kings war crowns just newer versions of headdresses to say
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:15.440]  i'm better than you i'm the authority same thing with cops big hats with big
[02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:18.720]  listening segments on them and logos and
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:22.320]  and and and big giant monolithic government buildings to send the message
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:27.040]  we're the big government you're little they send that message
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:32.480]  by design to separate the government uh from the people but but specifically and
[02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:35.920]  i've seen the videos of this it's almost i've seen it in new york we are
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:39.760]  changed they'll the cops that can barely speak english
[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:44.560]  from all over the world chinese russian you name it polish
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:48.640]  mexican they literally can't speak english when they
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.400]  walk over and go turn your camera off i take you to jail
[02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:56.080]  listen to me and the government knowingly
[02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:59.840]  is hiring foreigners to do this that's a big political issue in the u.s and
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:01.840]  england we need to start pointing this out they're
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:04.560]  bringing the foreigners in to be our rulers
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:07.520]  yeah and they've done this throughout history so you know in the in the chinese
[02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:11.280]  when the tianaman square um think you know china's a country of like 200
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:15.040]  different ethnicities and what they did when they to beijing they brought in
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:18.240]  farmers farmer troops from the rural areas who had no
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:20.560]  problems shooting people who weren't like them
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:23.200]  and then in britain right now as well you know got all these people from
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:25.840]  different countries they don't feel that same maybe
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:29.280]  bond with british people so yeah they'll follow their orders and you know
[02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:33.120]  someone said i can't remember who you can always pay half the poor to kill the
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:36.560]  other half and it's it's a sad state of affairs and that's why we need to stay
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:39.840]  very vigilant and as you say alex just keep shining a life on this keep
[02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:43.600]  showing people but sometimes i despair because i can show people like even
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:47.360]  uh the people closest to me a lot of my work and they go and so what who cares
[02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:49.280]  like it's not really happening because they've been
[02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:52.880]  you know um dumbed down by hollywood and they think almost that the paramilitary
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:56.720]  black uniforms are cool because it's in the Beyonce video riana has got them
[02:46:56.720 --> 02:47:00.080]  dancing on stage with her it's it's it's it's it's incredible and you go down
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:03.040]  the rabbit hole and you see how it's all connected you start connecting the
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:06.000]  dots and you show them government documents
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:09.280]  well they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and they giggle and then
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:13.600]  five years later they're dying of cancer it's still funny
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:17.600]  because it's a mind trick it's it's crime stop from orwell
[02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:20.640]  where where they decided isn't a threat to them
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:26.560]  and so they're part of the power structure yeah alex i had a very close
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:29.600]  friend of mine who was doing love police films with me i'm gonna i'm gonna
[02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:33.520]  respect his privacy but he got arrested and he's got three
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:38.000]  children and the police said unless you comply with us and bow down and stop
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:41.840]  doing these films we will get a psychiatrist here and section you which
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:45.200]  means to keep you under the mental health act you will lose your children
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:48.560]  and that's how they shot him up and luckily i don't have kids but it is a
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:52.560]  psychological battle and it just it makes me despair sometimes but i'm very
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:55.440]  optimistic i know we will win this we wouldn't be you wouldn't be doing your
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:58.640]  radio show i wouldn't be doing my films well think of that tyranny think of
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:02.000]  that ultimate tyranny it's like gary cooper
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:06.160]  uh had his son taken uh and it was in the police report
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:09.440]  they've taught their children not to trust the government and the court said
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:13.360]  we're taking them i mean you do you do not question your god
[02:48:13.360 --> 02:48:16.720]  you don't do that in america since when do you have freedom of speech in
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:19.600]  america you sit down you shut up and we're
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:22.800]  going to take your kids but they're already taking them with the water in
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:25.760]  the food folks they've already got them they're already soft killing them
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:28.720]  right now but the good news is the people are
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:31.920]  breaking the spell and we're not going along with it so
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:35.200]  so i mean my god that is soviet level tyranny so they said
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:38.240]  we're going to take your kids if you don't stop going out
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:41.920]  peacefully and speaking on the streets in england
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:46.240]  yeah his main message was everything is okay he was a very spiritual man still
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:48.800]  is and he went out there just wanting to lower
[02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:52.320]  fear around people and they i don't know if they were physical with them but
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:55.680]  they were certainly psychological in the soviet way and actually just this
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:58.560]  week in norway a friend of mine said there's a doctor
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:01.680]  been thrown in the psychiatric institution for speaking out against the
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:05.680]  swine flu vaccine and norway is probably you know people don't know this one of
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:09.680]  the last few truly communitarian communist countries in europe
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:13.840]  and it's uh it's it's mind-boggling but you know we just need to stay strong
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:17.840]  stay alive realize we're all in this together and i think
[02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:21.040]  alex they will fail the elites will fail because
[02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:24.960]  the system will collapse because you can't treat people like this and people
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:29.200]  are realizing this so i i reckon it's maybe two or three years before
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:32.720]  there's utter chaos and i you know they try and bring about order out of chaos
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:35.920]  that's the illuminati motto i think we need to bring about a bit of
[02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:39.120]  peaceful chaos out of their manufactured slave order
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:41.760]  it's the only way we need to get the universe spinning in different ways
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:45.120]  because as it stands now it's not a world i want to bring any
[02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:49.280]  children into so you know go do what's right
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:54.240]  think about that though they told him people can go watch the videos you're
[02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:57.120]  not going to go to a town square and talk to people
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:00.800]  and come up to police and say we care about you we're all humans together
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:05.280]  we eat at the same restaurants same grocery stores
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:08.320]  our children are growing up look at this police state
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:11.840]  you know let's let's care about each other and that's just we're taking your
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:17.280]  kids you do not do that i mean you do not talk
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:21.200]  you do not talk think of how evil those police are
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:27.120]  that that that they think it's okay to terrorize someone for their children
[02:50:27.120 --> 02:50:31.200]  they think of us literally a subhuman trash
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:34.960]  and notice as soon as the tyranny comes in as soon as they've got enough people
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:38.160]  ready to oppress the banks just steal everything
[02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:45.440]  the system is robbing everyone reducing us down to just groveling slaves
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:49.120]  we're gonna come back talk to frank mark bobby south and others the next two

[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:49.520]  yeah
[02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:58.400]  video after video of people coming over if you have a camera in public and
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:02.000]  hitting you attacking it but they don't mind the
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:05.360]  government's watching them and all over the us police are arresting people
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:08.400]  for wiretapping if they videotape police in public when there's no
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:12.160]  perception of privacy it's just crazy and i've
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:15.840]  noticed there's these comments over there by people of you must be an
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:18.720]  american so i guess they said that to you when you
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:21.360]  were talking to the new prime minister during his press conference they said
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:25.680]  oh shut up american so i guess calling somebody an american is like a
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:29.200]  big insult yeah what it is alexis on world war two
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:33.120]  when a lot of the gis were over in britain and obviously american men
[02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:35.920]  probably a bit more tan a bit more muscular than the
[02:55:35.920 --> 02:55:38.880]  some of the english and so they got lots of english girls and there was a big
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:43.600]  resentment amongst the english men about the yanks and bergatomas
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:46.800]  you know being very boisterous and having fun and enjoying the women so it
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:50.160]  is a a 60 year old racism against
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:54.240]  against americans and it's very funny because racism against americans when
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:58.400]  britain follows america very culturally and very closely so i think
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:01.920]  they just didn't have anything else to say to me so they just threw the yank
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:05.600]  comment at me which is quite funny
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:12.160]  it's all about divide and conquer let's go ahead and take a phone call frank in
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:15.520]  texas you're on the air go ahead yeah yeah

[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:29.680]  make physical contact with you know my wife said that last night we were at
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:32.880]  dinner and she said alex of course we're being attacked of

[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:42.560]  i mean you are on a front to the devil and i mean what else do you call it
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:45.920]  when the government in the u.s grabs over a million kids a year
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:49.360]  and abuses the daylights out of them what else do you call it when they poison
[02:56:49.360 --> 02:56:52.320]  the water and the food by design their own documents
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:56.800]  to sterilize us and give us cancer so i mean regardless if you believe in it
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:56:59.680]  or not that's what it is it's just pure
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:03.520]  pet of hell evil go ahead you can actually see them though i've seen them
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:07.920]  36 times between 1980 and corpus christius started
[02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:11.600]  and then i won't get into how it all happened i i got involved with some
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:15.680]  witches uh... you know unbeknownst to me i was a new christian
[02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:18.960]  and i opened up myself to my dear the girl to do it that claims you could
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:23.440]  look on your demons and uh... as a joke on halloween night she sick went on
[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:26.640]  me it sounds funny but it was a big black
[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:30.000]  uh... smoky looking thing and i try to wrap itself around my neck and i just
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:33.840]  called for jesus and it took off but uh... after that i have made contact
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:37.760]  with these things 36 times actually struck one in amaryllis texas one night
[02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:42.400]  with my fist another time i uh... the last time it was uh...

[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:52.720]  document but there's a lot of weird stuff going on in this world
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:55.600]  and other globalists they do believe in this
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:57:58.880]  almost all the top globalists are luciferians
[02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:02.640]  uh... any comments uh... on that from our guest charlie
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:06.560]  yeah absolutely um... my favorite inspire uh... is actually another texan

[02:58:10.320 --> 02:58:14.480]  doing things with satan and to me whether they are real demons in this
[02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:18.720]  universe or whatever that the metaphor of calling them satanists is correct
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:21.280]  let's not forget a lot of guys at the top the elites
[02:58:21.280 --> 02:58:25.120]  they are atheists in the christian monotheistic sense they believe in another
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:29.520]  religion which they will take energy lots of dark energy and fear
[02:58:29.520 --> 02:58:32.640]  and then use it but it's just a sign of their sick mind
[02:58:32.640 --> 02:58:35.520]  power corruption absolute power corrupt absolutely
[02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:39.120]  if they call them satanists they're just pathetic people

[03:00:57.840 --> 03:01:02.240]  it's an attack on our consciousness it's an attack they're attacking our the
[03:01:02.240 --> 03:01:05.920]  dna of who we are they're they're seeking to attack the food
[03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:09.840]  dna they're seeking to attack the the dna of our

[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:41.200]  to me it's about learning how to see learning how to perceive not only with
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:44.800]  our eyes but with all of our being our consciousness we have many abilities
[03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:50.720]  many talents many gifts as homo sapien this is an attack on homo sapien
[03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:55.040]  the common people of around the globe aren't at war with each other we
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:59.280]  we have much in common we have a scientific technocratic elite

[03:02:16.800 --> 03:02:21.840]  speak to what he was just saying yeah absolutely alex it's an ongoing battle
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:25.280]  between left brain and right brain between the machine hearts and machine
[03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:30.560]  minds and the spiritual alive human beings the machine men they hate us
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:34.320]  because they are so jealous of the love that we have in our hearts
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:38.080]  they are so jealous of the fact that we don't give up that we actually stand
[03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:43.040]  for truth and for each other so they will always try and control us because
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:46.880]  they don't understand us and you know fear leads to anger anger leads to hate
[03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:50.560]  hate leads to suffering they fear us which is why they are so desperate to
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:53.920]  control us and they will fail and i'm happy to say they will fail and i'll
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:57.920]  make sure they fail my end i hope everyone does their end as well

[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:27.200]  we have or that they have something kind of like we do here in
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:32.000]  in the the western states like north and south com and
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:35.920]  how they you know how does how did england go from kind of being a
[03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:39.920]  you know what happened to us back in the 80s where we were worried about the
[03:03:39.920 --> 03:03:43.360]  communists and all of a sudden it just kind of flips over and and
[03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:46.800]  turns against the people because i think it happened there faster
[03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:50.000]  where the the state kind of turned against the people
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:53.520]  is that is that you know they started a lot of that by staging terror attacks
[03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:57.280]  blaming it on the ira and we're going to keep you safe and then political
[03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:01.040]  correctness but i appreciate your call comments on that quickly

[03:08:05.040 --> 03:08:10.960]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[03:08:10.960 --> 03:08:15.600]  interspersed throughout the last 52 minutes of broadcast today i'm gonna
[03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:20.880]  hit on other important market news police state news military news
[03:08:20.880 --> 03:08:24.080]  that i haven't gotten to yet with our guest
[03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:28.080]  and we're also going to continue with taking some of your
[03:08:28.080 --> 03:08:33.920]  phone calls today but i've got a lot of calls about this the last four or five
[03:08:33.920 --> 03:08:38.880]  months and it it certainly is just another good alternative and an idea
[03:08:38.880 --> 03:08:42.560]  out there of having state chartered banks
[03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:46.800]  that aren't run by offshore you know banks that create derivatives and then
[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:50.960]  loan it basically to pension funds and governments and
[03:08:50.960 --> 03:08:54.960]  private investors and understand that you've got to identify the private
[03:08:54.960 --> 03:08:58.640]  run-for-profit federal reserve i mean it's just that simple
[03:08:58.640 --> 03:09:01.600]  because the bank of england is the same system the eu
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:05.920]  central bank is the same system this is the global private cartel that is
[03:09:05.920 --> 03:09:11.360]  taking control of the planet through the fact that
[03:09:11.360 --> 03:09:15.760]  they can just create all the money they want for themselves all of the
[03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:20.080]  assets all of the credit that they want
[03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:23.040]  and this is the group setting up world government this is the group erasing
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:25.680]  borders this is the group that owns both political parties
[03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:30.160]  this is the group that runs goldman sacks in every major regulatory position
[03:09:30.160 --> 03:09:34.160]  with the foxes guarding the henhouse with olayna kagan saying she wants your
[03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:37.920]  free speech she wants your guns she's a goldman sacks member
[03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:42.560]  uh... and uh... she's uh... written several books
[03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:46.480]  ellen brown dot com is her website and she's a uh...
[03:09:46.480 --> 03:09:50.960]  attorney in los angeles of course written web of debt
[03:09:50.960 --> 03:09:53.840]  and she also has written some interesting articles
[03:09:53.840 --> 03:09:57.120]  cash star states need to play the banking game
[03:09:57.120 --> 03:10:00.720]  north dakota shows how so we'll talk about
[03:10:00.720 --> 03:10:05.600]  of that state bank uh... and here's a quote from francis bacon he that will
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:08.480]  not apply new remedies must expect
[03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:13.360]  uh... new evils for time is the greatest innovator
[03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:18.640]  and uh... she joins us now thanks for coming on
[03:10:18.640 --> 03:10:21.200]  uh... tell us a little bit about yourself for those who just joined us
[03:10:21.200 --> 03:10:25.120]  break down your take on the banking cartel where we are economically
[03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:27.200]  worldwide right now what you see happening there
[03:10:27.200 --> 03:10:30.960]  and then let's talk about a solution it isn't a perfect solution it won't fix
[03:10:30.960 --> 03:10:33.760]  everything but uh... instead of having a private
[03:10:33.760 --> 03:10:37.680]  fellow reserve it i mean i mean even if the feds won't get control even if the
[03:10:37.680 --> 03:10:40.800]  congress won't take control of the issuance of currency and credit as
[03:10:40.800 --> 03:10:42.880]  they are commanded to in the constitution
[03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:46.560]  we can move at the state level as part of the state's rights movement
[03:10:46.560 --> 03:10:50.880]  to set up state banks so let's go through it exactly that's where i think
[03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:54.640]  we have the most uh... opportunity to uh...
[03:10:54.640 --> 03:10:59.120]  get a foot in the door and at the state level because congress is totally
[03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:03.600]  what paid for by wall street but they have but the states are desperate
[03:11:03.600 --> 03:11:06.400]  they've got uh... they have to balance their budget
[03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:10.960]  unlike the federal government which is thirteen trillion dollars in debt
[03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:14.720]  and just keeps going i mean they haven't paid off the federal debt
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:20.800]  since 1838 but the states are required to balance their budget
[03:11:20.800 --> 03:11:24.400]  and that they're all in the red except one state there's only one
[03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:29.120]  solvent state at the moment and that's North Dakota actually Montana is
[03:11:29.120 --> 03:11:33.920]  solving at the moment but by 2011 they project that they're going to be in the
[03:11:33.920 --> 03:11:37.600]  red so they're gonna have to slash services and and the big central banks
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:40.640]  are doing the same thing they've done in hundreds of third world nations they go
[03:11:40.640 --> 03:11:41.360]  in
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:45.120]  they get the countries in debt so they can then be economically subservient to the
[03:11:45.120 --> 03:11:47.200]  banking cartel that makes the money
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:50.400]  out of nothing and so you have all these unfunded mandates the states are going
[03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:52.720]  bankrupt what does the federal government do
[03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:56.560]  even more unfunded mandates and then as things go completely bankrupt
[03:11:56.560 --> 03:12:00.160]  the feds just absorb the states so the states have got
[03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:04.320]  to rebel through their ninth and tenth amendment powers now or never reverse
[03:12:04.320 --> 03:12:05.440]  this
[03:12:05.440 --> 03:12:11.120]  right um if all of our money actually is created by banks in the form of loans
[03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:14.640]  that's my book web of debt that's the basic
[03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:18.080]  premise the thing that most people don't realize most people think the
[03:12:18.080 --> 03:12:18.960]  government
[03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:22.320]  creates money and that it's the government fault that we have all these
[03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:25.920]  troubles but if the government district create money why are they 13 trillion
[03:12:25.920 --> 03:12:28.960]  dollars in debt in fact it all comes from banks
[03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:32.400]  yeah kennedy issued some of our own money and got his head blown off the last
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:35.440]  president to do it of course was uh lincoln for those that don't know
[03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:39.440]  that's a good place to start explain to them how fractional reserve banking
[03:12:39.440 --> 03:12:42.720]  works and now with derivatives it's not even fractional they just make up
[03:12:42.720 --> 03:12:46.640]  whatever they want right uh fractional reserve lending goes back
[03:12:46.640 --> 03:12:51.120]  to the 17th century when the goldsmiths would uh
[03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:55.040]  take people's gold for safekeeping and nobody really wanted to carry around
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:12:58.480]  this heavy dangerous gold so the goldsmiths gave them
[03:12:58.480 --> 03:13:02.320]  little paper receipts that later evolved into bank notes
[03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:06.480]  and they soon discovered that they could lend
[03:13:06.480 --> 03:13:11.680]  um 10 times as many bank notes as they actually had gold because people would
[03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:14.480]  only come for their gold 10 percent of the time
[03:13:14.480 --> 03:13:18.320]  so that was the origin of our 10 percent fractional reserve system we still
[03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:22.080]  have the 10 percent even though there's no longer any
[03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:25.920]  gold in the system it's still roughly true that people
[03:13:25.920 --> 03:13:29.920]  come for their money come to the bank about 10 percent of the time and
[03:13:29.920 --> 03:13:33.040]  90 percent of the time they leave their money in the bank
[03:13:33.040 --> 03:13:36.800]  so banks are able to leverage their deposits
[03:13:36.800 --> 03:13:40.720]  by about a factor of 10 in other words they can lend
[03:13:40.720 --> 03:13:44.240]  many times more money than they actually have
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:49.920]  and that's how credit is created well in fact today banks don't even look at
[03:13:49.920 --> 03:13:53.200]  their reserves they don't pay any attention to what deposits they have
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:57.920]  when they make a loan if it if a good far or say a good client a corporate
[03:13:57.920 --> 03:14:00.320]  cop client comes to the bank and wants a loan
[03:14:00.320 --> 03:14:03.520]  the bank just writes it writes it into their account
[03:14:03.520 --> 03:14:07.040]  and then it worries about the reserves later so
[03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:11.440]  let's say you you came in and you wanted a half a million dollar loan to buy a
[03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:15.360]  house and you would sign a mortgage and the bank
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:19.040]  counts that as a negotiable instrument that's an asset to
[03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:22.080]  themselves because you have promised to pay that
[03:14:22.080 --> 03:14:24.960]  sum over time so they write that on one side of their books
[03:14:24.960 --> 03:14:30.480]  as an asset and on the other side they write it as a liability to themselves
[03:14:30.480 --> 03:14:33.280]  because you are now going to be able to write
[03:14:33.280 --> 03:14:36.720]  checks on that five hundred thousand dollars that they're going to write into
[03:14:36.720 --> 03:14:40.320]  your account and when you do the banks will
[03:14:40.320 --> 03:14:44.240]  have to pay out on that so that's where the money comes from
[03:14:44.240 --> 03:14:47.440]  that that liability where where you're allowed to write
[03:14:47.440 --> 03:14:51.360]  checks that's the origin of all the money that circulates in the economy
[03:14:51.360 --> 03:14:55.200]  except for coins which now composed only one
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:15:00.640]  ten thousand of the total money supply the m3 money supply
[03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:05.280]  so and as the public begins to learn that gold and silver is real money
[03:15:05.280 --> 03:15:09.920]  versus crud paper that's being devalued globally across the board not just our
[03:15:09.920 --> 03:15:13.520]  currency you're going to see as people rush into
[03:15:13.520 --> 03:15:19.040]  gold its price go up according to all the laws of economics
[03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:24.240]  well true and i myself am a heavy believer in gold
[03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:28.080]  silver but right now our entire money system
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:32.160]  is a series of legal agreements there's nothing behind it and it's actually
[03:15:32.160 --> 03:15:36.480]  not that bad of a system except for the fact that it's privately owned
[03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:41.680]  we have private bankers pretending to have money that's what
[03:15:41.680 --> 03:15:46.080]  Jefferson said Thomas Jefferson said when he figured this out like 20 years
[03:15:46.080 --> 03:15:49.520]  after that after the continental congress
[03:15:49.520 --> 03:15:53.840]  and he figured out that that the bank the first u.s bank
[03:15:53.840 --> 03:15:57.600]  was just pretending to have money so he called them bold and bankrupted
[03:15:57.600 --> 03:16:02.320]  ventures just pretending to have money that we had been tricked by them
[03:16:02.320 --> 03:16:05.760]  into giving them the power to issue our currency
[03:16:05.760 --> 03:16:10.720]  so that banks still have the power to issue our currency and lend it to us
[03:16:10.720 --> 03:16:15.760]  but if it were a publicly owned bank so that the interest went back to the
[03:16:15.760 --> 03:16:20.240]  public then it would be a mathematically sustainable system
[03:16:20.240 --> 03:16:23.840]  and that's what the constitution states it should be but if the feds won't do it
[03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:26.880]  we're trying to audit the fed and having more success
[03:16:26.880 --> 03:16:30.560]  we can still go to the state level now here's a quote out of a local paper in
[03:16:30.560 --> 03:16:34.000]  North Dakota it says North Dakota is a sparsely populated state
[03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:38.480]  of less than 700,000 known for cold weather isolated farmers
[03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:42.880]  and the hit movie Fargo yet for some reason it defies the real estate cliche
[03:16:42.880 --> 03:16:48.080]  of location location location since 2000 the state's gmp gross
[03:16:48.080 --> 03:16:52.640]  product has grown 56 percent personal income
[03:16:52.640 --> 03:16:55.920]  has grown 43 percent and wages have grown 34
[03:16:55.920 --> 03:17:01.040]  this year the state has a budget surplus of 1.2 billion dollars
[03:17:01.040 --> 03:17:04.080]  and you believe from your research a lot of that has to do
[03:17:04.080 --> 03:17:07.920]  with it having a state bank break that down explain the difference between a
[03:17:07.920 --> 03:17:12.320]  state bank and say JP Morgan well this would be a
[03:17:12.320 --> 03:17:15.200]  state owned bank of course all states have state banks
[03:17:15.200 --> 03:17:18.880]  I mean a state yeah state owned bank state owned bank
[03:17:18.880 --> 03:17:22.640]  North Dakota is the only state that owned its own bank
[03:17:22.640 --> 03:17:28.560]  and it's owned it since 1919 it was set up under circumstances very similar
[03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:32.160]  to what we have today it was a populist movement the farmers were losing their
[03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:36.480]  farm to the wall street bankers and they when they realized that their money
[03:17:36.480 --> 03:17:39.760]  was going out of state and that it was actually being
[03:17:39.760 --> 03:17:43.760]  fraudulently taken that the farmers were not
[03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:47.920]  being able to sell their perfectly good grain to the grainaries which were a
[03:17:47.920 --> 03:17:52.480]  cartel with the railroad which were a cartel with the banks it was all one
[03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:56.800]  big cartel back you know the rock feller days
[03:17:56.800 --> 03:17:59.920]  when they figured that out they banded together
[03:17:59.920 --> 03:18:04.400]  formed a political party which they called the non part
[03:18:04.400 --> 03:18:09.520]  nonpartisan league it was not a it was neither right nor left it was just
[03:18:09.520 --> 03:18:13.920]  a group of farmers trying to keep their own credit in their own
[03:18:13.920 --> 03:18:18.400]  state so all of it all the states could be as
[03:18:18.400 --> 03:18:22.640]  it could have the same sort of flourishing GDP that they have but we
[03:18:22.640 --> 03:18:27.520]  are all suffering from a credit crisis that was precipitated in wall street
[03:18:27.520 --> 03:18:32.000]  because wall street banks have gotten trouble with their dodgy collateral
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:36.000]  etc so North Dakota just escaped all that
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:40.720]  by law all the state revenues go into the bank of North Dakota
[03:18:40.720 --> 03:18:43.920]  so they have a huge potential deposit base
[03:18:43.920 --> 03:18:49.040]  and it's set up as North Dakota doing business as the bank of North Dakota so
[03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:53.840]  it's set up as a dba if all of the technically all of the assets
[03:18:53.840 --> 03:18:57.440]  of the state are the assets of the bank so it's got a huge
[03:18:57.440 --> 03:19:01.920]  potential capital base a huge deposit base and it can leverage that
[03:19:01.920 --> 03:19:06.320]  in too many times that someone loans and so they have the fractional reserve power
[03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:10.000]  to empower the people and that way the money stays in the state
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:14.240]  it's not sold into derivatives to Thailand or to Russia
[03:19:14.240 --> 03:19:18.320]  or to england uh and and and so you have sovereignty and you have
[03:19:18.320 --> 03:19:23.280]  transparency instead of take the state of texas takes most of the tax money
[03:19:23.280 --> 03:19:27.040]  invested in secretive funds and derivatives and then the
[03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:30.960]  comprehensive annual financial reports show they've got a double set of books
[03:19:30.960 --> 03:19:35.200]  and that was okay though it gave the bankers great power the private bankers
[03:19:35.200 --> 03:19:38.640]  when the derivatives were on the way up but now the states are all bankrupt
[03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:43.680]  because the bankers set them up they swindled all the tax money investments
[03:19:43.680 --> 03:19:47.440]  and and and so now we're defunct just where the bankers wanted us
[03:19:47.440 --> 03:19:50.320]  so in this big states rights movement we need to move
[03:19:50.320 --> 03:19:54.480]  to have other states look at state banks that is state
[03:19:54.480 --> 03:20:01.520]  where the state's money is in a public bank uh stay there we'll be right back
[03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:06.480]  the question is where should the american people draw their line in the sand
[03:20:06.480 --> 03:20:12.160]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on a constitution
[03:20:12.160 --> 03:20:16.480]  which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and
[03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:19.520]  a sheet voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:23.440]  they think they're on our water children our education our money
[03:20:23.440 --> 03:20:27.440]  so we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:31.440]  somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the patriot uprising you're
[03:20:31.440 --> 03:20:34.640]  having more we have the facts we have the constitution
[03:20:34.640 --> 03:20:38.400]  we have the bill of rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies and

[03:23:48.880 --> 03:24:03.440]  call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[03:24:03.440 --> 03:24:06.960]  all right Ellen this is a short segment long segment coming up but this is so
[03:24:06.960 --> 03:24:10.800]  important i know it's not basketball or football or
[03:24:10.800 --> 03:24:14.800]  getting drunk for new listeners out there that may be tuning in
[03:24:14.800 --> 03:24:18.720]  but it's it's getting control of our lives if we let offshore banks
[03:24:18.720 --> 03:24:21.680]  have the power to issue all the currency and credit they want
[03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:25.360]  they're going to take over and they have and announce themselves our rulers
[03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:28.800]  and a new empire and they're very corrupt wicked people who also believe in
[03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:32.320]  eugenics so we we must take our states back to get our
[03:24:32.320 --> 03:24:36.800]  federal government back and the example of north dakota is a great
[03:24:36.800 --> 03:24:40.560]  case point example now now you've written about this in your book
[03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:45.600]  you've got a web of debt.com let's let's let's walk through what a state bank
[03:24:45.600 --> 03:24:49.120]  is not a state charter bank but a bank of the state
[03:24:49.120 --> 03:24:52.640]  that's transparent and and and how this could be rolled out
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:57.840]  in other states in north dakota as i mentioned all of the
[03:24:57.840 --> 03:25:01.920]  revenues of the state go into the bank and then
[03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:05.840]  those become the deposits plus they take depositors from
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:10.320]  individuals or take deposits so you know the way banking work
[03:25:10.320 --> 03:25:16.480]  that the bank just makes loans to anybody it needs it wants to make
[03:25:16.480 --> 03:25:20.320]  loans too but then when that when the checks go out of the bank
[03:25:20.320 --> 03:25:25.440]  they have to clear through a clearing house usually the federal reserve but
[03:25:25.440 --> 03:25:29.120]  the bank of north dakota is and actually a member of the
[03:25:29.120 --> 03:25:32.720]  well i guess they are a member but they don't they don't have fdis the
[03:25:32.720 --> 03:25:36.320]  insurance and they don't they don't use it so anyway
[03:25:36.320 --> 03:25:41.680]  that so the checks have to clear by you have to have the same amount
[03:25:41.680 --> 03:25:46.320]  going in in the way of deposits as you have going out as far as i can see that
[03:25:46.320 --> 03:25:49.760]  that's really just the route to make it look like you're not creating money on
[03:25:49.760 --> 03:25:53.360]  your book because those deposits coming in
[03:25:53.360 --> 03:25:58.320]  are like mr smith the check that just came in it is not to the same
[03:25:58.320 --> 03:26:02.720]  it's not the money that mr jones has going out in the form of a check in other
[03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:07.200]  words mr smith never said that mr jones could borrow his money
[03:26:07.200 --> 03:26:10.720]  and you never go into the bank and they say i'm sorry
[03:26:10.720 --> 03:26:14.400]  we just let your money out for 30 years come back later
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:19.440]  they always have the money it's because they have this sort of fungible pool
[03:26:19.440 --> 03:26:24.080]  and they make that pool sort of serve all purposes
[03:26:24.080 --> 03:26:28.000]  well the goldsmiths discovered 500 years ago that they would hold your gold
[03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:29.680]  because you didn't want to keep it in your house
[03:26:29.680 --> 03:26:33.840]  and then they could give you the receipts and that no one hardly ever came in at
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:37.840]  once wanting all their gold and even if a few people did you still had enough so
[03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:39.760]  that's what allowed it but but explain to people
[03:26:39.760 --> 03:26:43.280]  how a a state bank like north dakota has
[03:26:43.280 --> 03:26:46.480]  empowers the people and how it works and how it's different
[03:26:46.480 --> 03:26:49.680]  from the system that the private bankers have
[03:26:49.680 --> 03:26:54.320]  okay in in north dakota the state bank is actually pretty much a bankers bank
[03:26:54.320 --> 03:26:57.520]  they do make some commercial loans but mostly
[03:26:57.520 --> 03:27:01.200]  they are partnering with the other banks so
[03:27:01.200 --> 03:27:05.040]  where all the other states banks have a capital problem
[03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:08.880]  because of the bank for international settlement capital requirement
[03:27:08.880 --> 03:27:13.840]  and the fact that they they had this dodgy collateral in their books that
[03:27:13.840 --> 03:27:18.400]  froze uh froze the whole credit mechanism etc
[03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:21.920]  it used to be that there were secondary lenders
[03:27:21.920 --> 03:27:25.520]  called shadow lenders the investors who would buy these collateralized debt
[03:27:25.520 --> 03:27:29.600]  obligations which are bundled mortgages off the banks and then
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:32.960]  they that would clear their books and they could make another set of loans and
[03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:36.080]  another set of loans all based on the same capital
[03:27:36.080 --> 03:27:41.520]  but when those shadow lenders went away the banks were stuck with the limits
[03:27:41.520 --> 03:27:46.320]  of their original capital so that froze up credit well in north dakota
[03:27:46.320 --> 03:27:52.960]  the bank of north dakota uh served as that uh get partners with those banks
[03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:56.240]  and it takes the loans off their books making room for more and more
[03:27:56.240 --> 03:28:01.440]  so generally the the community banks the local banks are dealing directly
[03:28:01.440 --> 03:28:05.920]  with customers and then the bank of north dakota
[03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:09.600]  it back stops those banks rather like the federal reserve does it's sort of
[03:28:09.600 --> 03:28:14.000]  like the mini fed for the state yeah it's the insurance policy but
[03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:17.200]  but you know not just the bank of north dakota we see
[03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:21.600]  local state banks that are private uh being much more healthy than the big
[03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:25.040]  mega banks that created these derivatives and under the new bank
[03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:28.400]  re-regulation legislation actually written by goldman sacks and others
[03:28:28.400 --> 03:28:31.920]  it allows them to come in and take over the healthy state
[03:28:31.920 --> 03:28:36.480]  or regional banks right so so we see a major consolidation
[03:28:36.480 --> 03:28:42.160]  taking place here right so that if you have a state bank it can help those
[03:28:42.160 --> 03:28:45.280]  struggling little banks that are struggling with that now they're
[03:28:45.280 --> 03:28:48.320]  talking about raising the capital requirement they're making it even more
[03:28:48.320 --> 03:28:53.040]  difficult for the little local banks and so the state bank can help with that
[03:28:53.040 --> 03:28:57.760]  one major advantage is that all the interest goes back
[03:28:57.760 --> 03:29:02.160]  to the state so so in north dakota it's actually
[03:29:02.160 --> 03:29:06.160]  a big moneymaker for the state they get a big dividend every year
[03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:10.160]  so that reduces the amount of taxes that people have to pay
[03:29:10.160 --> 03:29:14.240]  but plus it's got a mission statement that is
[03:29:14.240 --> 03:29:18.400]  geared toward helping the state so we're a private bank
[03:29:18.400 --> 03:29:22.720]  it like any corporation has to serve its shareholders so if goldman sacks
[03:29:22.720 --> 03:29:26.800]  can make more money speculating in derivatives than in making commercial
[03:29:26.800 --> 03:29:30.320]  loans to businesses that might go bankrupt they have to
[03:29:30.320 --> 03:29:33.600]  speculate that's what their business model is they have to serve
[03:29:33.600 --> 03:29:37.920]  their private shareholders and they have lobbyists at the state level getting a
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:42.000]  state to invest tax money in their system giving them
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:44.320]  more power stay there let's come back and talk
[03:29:44.320 --> 03:29:48.080]  about how we roll this out in other states and if you're starting to see
[03:29:48.080 --> 03:29:54.400]  this being discussed in in other states we're on the march the empires on the

[03:36:42.480 --> 03:36:45.360]  saying that they're going to have warrantless blood checkpoints you've
[03:36:45.360 --> 03:36:48.160]  heard about those and that they can find marijuana
[03:36:48.160 --> 03:36:51.520]  uh for up to a hundred days generally just 30
[03:36:51.520 --> 03:36:55.360]  and of any cannabis that over 80 of the public reportedly smokes from time to
[03:36:55.360 --> 03:36:57.200]  time i guess i'm part of the 20 percent that
[03:36:57.200 --> 03:37:00.960]  rarely smokes pot i smoked it here in there don't really like it but the
[03:37:00.960 --> 03:37:05.440]  issue is think it doesn't matter uh they're just going to take your blood
[03:37:05.440 --> 03:37:08.160]  you've got all these universities saying got to give us dna to
[03:37:08.160 --> 03:37:11.360]  you know get into the university uh it's just so
[03:37:11.360 --> 03:37:15.040]  incredible that now they're going to take your blood
[03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:19.600]  at checkpoints and or a cheek swab and if they find thc
[03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:25.200]  prison time prison time uh so you smoke pot a hundred days ago
[03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:28.000]  doesn't matter you're going you're going to prison
[03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:32.800]  here's one us states pension funds becoming federal issue it talks about
[03:37:32.800 --> 03:37:36.320]  state pension funds going bankrupt because they invested them in derivatives
[03:37:36.320 --> 03:37:38.960]  don't worry the feds are going to take it over and only give you
[03:37:38.960 --> 03:37:43.520]  part of your money back folks it's happened everywhere else and it's
[03:37:43.520 --> 03:37:46.800]  happening here people better get their priority
[03:37:46.800 --> 03:37:50.960]  straight um going back to ellen brown the website's
[03:37:50.960 --> 03:37:54.480]  web of debt dot com she's got a great book out on the subject of the federal
[03:37:54.480 --> 03:37:58.000]  reserve uh but then another important article cash
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:00.880]  strapped states need to play the banking game
[03:38:00.880 --> 03:38:04.560]  north dakota shows how let's say you were on national news
[03:38:04.560 --> 03:38:09.280]  uh ellen and you had five minutes to explain this the basic bullet points
[03:38:09.280 --> 03:38:12.480]  why it's important what the alternative means going with the
[03:38:12.480 --> 03:38:15.440]  offshore bankers i mean if you had five minutes to just
[03:38:15.440 --> 03:38:20.000]  nail it and and and to crystallize why this is such a great avenue to
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:22.400]  financial liberty and sovereignty and freedom
[03:38:22.400 --> 03:38:27.440]  what would you say well we have a still have a credit freeze on in all the
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:31.360]  states and if you own your own bank you can create credit
[03:38:31.360 --> 03:38:36.160]  and states have a huge deposit and capital base with which they can
[03:38:36.160 --> 03:38:40.240]  um leverage their money and create credit so they could fund
[03:38:40.240 --> 03:38:43.360]  many things that we think we don't have the money for now like
[03:38:43.360 --> 03:38:47.440]  infrastructure and education and low-cost housing
[03:38:47.440 --> 03:38:51.360]  plus states are paying well in california we're paying an average of
[03:38:51.360 --> 03:38:54.880]  4.7 interest on our debt if you're a bank
[03:38:54.880 --> 03:38:57.760]  banks borrow from each other at the federal funds rate
[03:38:57.760 --> 03:39:02.640]  of zero to 0.25 percent that's what the fed funds rate is right now
[03:39:02.640 --> 03:39:05.680]  so it's an average of something like 0.2 percent
[03:39:05.680 --> 03:39:10.560]  so if you're a bank just for starters the state could start
[03:39:10.560 --> 03:39:14.240]  funding its projects at a very low interest rate
[03:39:14.240 --> 03:39:18.560]  and we've seen that well recently there was a lawsuit for these
[03:39:18.560 --> 03:39:24.400]  uh big banks that were colluding to set prices so the states are paying
[03:39:24.400 --> 03:39:27.680]  oh much more than they than they should be
[03:39:27.680 --> 03:39:32.160]  paying for for interest plus we're subject to the rating agency you know
[03:39:32.160 --> 03:39:36.080]  california where i live is has a rating that's
[03:39:36.080 --> 03:39:42.560]  just hovering above recess and we in california but the state has never
[03:39:42.560 --> 03:39:47.920]  defaulted on its debt and there are the wall street banks which would be
[03:39:47.920 --> 03:39:51.920]  bankrupt totally if we the people including largely california
[03:39:51.920 --> 03:39:56.400]  hadn't bailed them out they are paying this incredibly low interest rate and
[03:39:56.400 --> 03:39:59.680]  we're paying a high rate because of our bad credit rating
[03:39:59.680 --> 03:40:05.360]  so we could play their game in other words we can step into their shoes
[03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:11.200]  get all the perks that a bank gets by being a bank
[03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:17.520]  continue um well i i had started to explain about how banks
[03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:24.000]  create money when a bank um it first it creates money on its books and then the
[03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:27.680]  the check goes out of the bank and then it has to clear
[03:40:27.680 --> 03:40:30.640]  and if the bank doesn't have the deposit make it clear
[03:40:30.640 --> 03:40:34.320]  then it just borrows that money back from the
[03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:38.240]  other banks and it borrows that 0.2 percent interest so essentially what it
[03:40:38.240 --> 03:40:41.440]  does is it creates money the money goes out and it
[03:40:41.440 --> 03:40:44.720]  borrows that very same money back in other words the pool has enough money
[03:40:44.720 --> 03:40:48.320]  out there because it just created it and put it out into the pool
[03:40:48.320 --> 03:40:52.960]  it borrows that same money back at 0.2 percent interest with that fund rate
[03:40:52.960 --> 03:40:58.000]  or you know one point something if they're taking longer
[03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:01.280]  CDs or whatever but still it's a very low interest rate
[03:41:01.280 --> 03:41:07.120]  and then they relend that to the state at like california 4.7 percent or two
[03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:12.400]  individuals at six percent or something or on credit cards up to 30 percent or
[03:41:12.400 --> 03:41:15.600]  whatever it is so they're getting this huge spread
[03:41:15.600 --> 03:41:19.040]  and if you own the bank then that spread
[03:41:19.040 --> 03:41:22.640]  become taxpayer money i mean it goes back into the pool
[03:41:22.640 --> 03:41:27.120]  and fees the pool you had mentioned about the comprehensive annual financial
[03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:32.080]  reports i was just uh i was asked to speak at a
[03:41:32.080 --> 03:41:36.240]  government finance officer's convention about a month ago in missouri
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:40.480]  so i had a chance to talk to all these finance officers and they said indeed
[03:41:40.480 --> 03:41:45.520]  that they had these huge rainy day pools that were anywhere from 20 percent to
[03:41:45.520 --> 03:41:48.480]  75 percent of their budget that they had to
[03:41:48.480 --> 03:41:52.000]  stock away in this rainy day fund and the reason was
[03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:56.880]  that unlike banks which have this infinite credit line and can borrow any
[03:41:56.880 --> 03:42:01.840]  time they want they can't borrow you know they
[03:42:01.840 --> 03:42:05.680]  have to go to the voters and do a bond issue it's a big
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:08.800]  laborious process and it's never certain whether it's even
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:11.120]  going to happen they don't know if they're going to be able to auction off
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:14.720]  their bond so it's actually happened in missouri there where
[03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:18.400]  a city would just come to a standstill like there would be no money for
[03:42:18.400 --> 03:42:21.840]  anything and the city would stop because they didn't plan their
[03:42:21.840 --> 03:42:26.480]  budgets correctly so just to make sure they stock away all this money in rainy
[03:42:26.480 --> 03:42:30.000]  day funds well you can't you can't like in
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:34.240]  california i know that treasurer manages 70 billion
[03:42:34.240 --> 03:42:39.040]  dollars in a treasure pool of this sort of rainy day fund
[03:42:39.040 --> 03:42:43.440]  um whereas so the state's like 26 billion dollars in debt and we have 70
[03:42:43.440 --> 03:42:47.200]  billion sitting in this investment pool but you're not allowed to touch it
[03:42:47.200 --> 03:42:50.240]  because it's all earmarked for different things like
[03:42:50.240 --> 03:42:54.240]  governor schwarznecker tried to get some of the highway fund money
[03:42:54.240 --> 03:42:58.160]  and uh and the court in san diego said no no that
[03:42:58.160 --> 03:43:01.360]  that was that earmarked earmarked for highways you have to use
[03:43:01.360 --> 03:43:04.400]  well to interrupt it's basically all rigged
[03:43:04.400 --> 03:43:08.400]  to the big mega banks and now they've taken over society and nafton gatt
[03:43:08.400 --> 03:43:12.560]  has destroyed our industrial base and and and now to cover this breaking news
[03:43:12.560 --> 03:43:16.320]  uh and we'll continue with you in a moment ma'am world stocks tumble as
[03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:21.200]  debt woes rumble on and the more trillions the bankers get the worst
[03:43:21.200 --> 03:43:24.160]  things get the less they loan this is their system
[03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:28.400]  world markets fell sharply once again thursday a sentiment continued to be hit
[03:43:28.400 --> 03:43:31.920]  by concerns about the continent's debt crisis
[03:43:31.920 --> 03:43:37.040]  and figures showed an unexpected increase in us jobless claims last week
[03:43:37.040 --> 03:43:40.240]  the worries left most of the world's leading indexes
[03:43:40.240 --> 03:43:44.320]  uh now trading below where they were in 2010
[03:43:44.320 --> 03:43:50.480]  at the start of 2010 in europe the fts e 100 index of leading british shares
[03:43:50.480 --> 03:43:57.600]  closed down 84.95 points or 1.7 percent uh at 5,073.13 while
[03:43:57.600 --> 03:44:04.960]  germany's dax slid to 120 79 points or 2 percent to 5,867.88
[03:44:04.960 --> 03:44:10.800]  the cac 40 in france ended 79.15 points or 2.3 percent lower
[03:44:10.800 --> 03:44:16.240]  uh at 3,432.52 things got no better on wall street the dal
[03:44:16.240 --> 03:44:21.920]  jones industrial average plunged 209.87 points or 2 percent
[03:44:21.920 --> 03:44:30.400]  at 10,234.50 while the broader standard in pours 500 futures dropped 25.06
[03:44:30.400 --> 03:44:37.520]  points or 2.3 percent to 1089.99 the euro debt crisis
[03:44:37.520 --> 03:44:40.320]  continued to be the main point of interest in the markets and fears are
[03:44:40.320 --> 03:44:43.840]  growing that it may prove to be the catalyst to a renewed downturn in
[03:44:43.840 --> 03:44:46.880]  global growth there has been no growth if not an outright
[03:44:46.880 --> 03:44:50.080]  slide back into recession we've never been out of the recession folks three
[03:44:50.080 --> 03:44:54.800]  quarters of recession is depression while stocks tank oil prices slid
[03:44:54.800 --> 03:44:58.560]  below $70 a barrel the 10-year u.s treasury yields dropped
[03:44:58.560 --> 03:45:04.320]  to a 2010 low sentiment is awful and confidence has been trash said david
[03:45:04.320 --> 03:45:09.680]  buick uh markets analyst at bgc partners i mean the issue here is folks
[03:45:09.680 --> 03:45:12.960]  it's only going to get worse like we told you two years ago in the last stage
[03:45:12.960 --> 03:45:17.920]  crisis okay the stimulus money's only spent on sweetheart insiders this is
[03:45:17.920 --> 03:45:21.360]  a criminal consolidation we have the internal emails of
[03:45:21.360 --> 03:45:26.240]  goldman sacks either they are brought to justice and kicked out
[03:45:26.240 --> 03:45:29.120]  of our country along with calderon saying this is
[03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:33.040]  mexico when he wants our guns either we wake up and get angry which is starting
[03:45:33.040 --> 03:45:37.360]  to happen or we become debt slaves and they'll do it they're their
[03:45:37.360 --> 03:45:40.560]  experts at it they know how to bring you down into financial slavery
[03:45:40.560 --> 03:45:43.600]  they know how to put a police state into suppress you they've done it hundreds
[03:45:43.600 --> 03:45:49.920]  of times this is hard core information and everything is unfolding according
[03:45:49.920 --> 03:45:53.040]  to their program but the awakening is bigger than they
[03:45:53.040 --> 03:45:57.200]  thought it would be and brzezinski and others are starting to panic
[03:45:57.200 --> 03:46:02.560]  but you know knowing how this system works elin brown
[03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:05.920]  and you know it's one thing to know it's coming it's another thing to now see
[03:46:05.920 --> 03:46:08.800]  it here and to know where we're going from this point
[03:46:08.800 --> 03:46:13.440]  straight down you know being a lawyer researcher author on the fellow reserve
[03:46:13.440 --> 03:46:16.720]  i mean do you ever have a sense of unrealness yourself because i know i
[03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:19.920]  feel like that that it's just so incredible
[03:46:19.920 --> 03:46:23.680]  the the the earth shaking events that are happening right now and the public
[03:46:23.680 --> 03:46:27.360]  somewhat awake but if they had any idea just how horrific this is i think
[03:46:27.360 --> 03:46:31.040]  they'd be even more awake and more angry because i talked to so many yuppies
[03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:33.840]  who say i'm glad the euro's plunging that'll help us
[03:46:33.840 --> 03:46:37.920]  no we're going down to we're all under the same global system
[03:46:37.920 --> 03:46:42.560]  and it's people just live in denial about this
[03:46:42.560 --> 03:46:46.640]  i don't think people understand this is the beginning of the implosion
[03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:50.640]  as bad as it is we ain't seen nothing yet as they say
[03:46:50.640 --> 03:46:54.800]  my book web of debt that the theme of it is the wizard of odds and that's
[03:46:54.800 --> 03:46:58.720]  you know the whole idea that nothing is well what we think actually the wizard
[03:46:58.720 --> 03:47:02.000]  of odds was written as a monetary allegory in the 1890s
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:05.200]  when they had a big populist movement for money reform
[03:47:05.200 --> 03:47:09.120]  which is what i think we need to do today they almost won and that's
[03:47:09.120 --> 03:47:13.200]  and now we've seen a hundred years later that the bankers have messed everything
[03:47:13.200 --> 03:47:18.720]  up it is time for us to step in and take back our government by
[03:47:18.720 --> 03:47:22.640]  taking back the money power we have lost the power to issue our own money in
[03:47:22.640 --> 03:47:27.040]  our own credit and that's where we lost their government
[03:47:27.040 --> 03:47:32.560]  so yeah in the case of the euro that all those countries
[03:47:32.560 --> 03:47:36.560]  are they're all in debt now how is that possible if they're all in debt it's
[03:47:36.560 --> 03:47:41.200]  because they're in debt to bankers which create their money and lend it to them
[03:47:41.200 --> 03:47:45.280]  and it's designed the bankers brag as a black hole
[03:47:45.280 --> 03:47:49.360]  to consolidate the small banks to to bankrupt the states
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:54.560]  the nations it is designed to give them total power
[03:47:54.560 --> 03:47:57.920]  that's right and that the head is that the bank for international settlements
[03:47:57.920 --> 03:48:01.520]  which is now tightening the screws even more by
[03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:08.240]  they're talking about imposing global vat global carbon taxes yeah break down
[03:48:08.240 --> 03:48:12.240]  from your research the pyramidal power structure who's at the top
[03:48:12.240 --> 03:48:15.280]  and again the very bankers that engineered the crisis now saying
[03:48:15.280 --> 03:48:19.360]  give us global taxes give us total control or the economy is going to
[03:48:19.360 --> 03:48:23.280]  implode well the way the bankers in general have
[03:48:23.280 --> 03:48:28.400]  kept a tight reign on economies is by contracting the money
[03:48:28.400 --> 03:48:32.960]  so they never allow enough money to be out there to run the whole economy
[03:48:32.960 --> 03:48:36.800]  and therefore people have to borrow and that starts this whole pyramid
[03:48:36.800 --> 03:48:41.040]  or pine scheme where you have to have more and more and more borrowers
[03:48:41.040 --> 03:48:47.440]  to support the money supply so you could say that the bank for
[03:48:47.440 --> 03:48:50.720]  international settlements is responsible for all this this whole
[03:48:50.720 --> 03:48:55.600]  collapse of this whole recent collapse in 1988
[03:48:55.600 --> 03:48:59.760]  they imposed Basel 1 the first capital requirement
[03:48:59.760 --> 03:49:02.880]  and at that time the Japanese banks were the biggest
[03:49:02.880 --> 03:49:07.200]  biggest creditors in the world they were the Japanese economy was booming and
[03:49:07.200 --> 03:49:11.040]  the banks were huge and so the bank for international
[03:49:11.040 --> 03:49:14.720]  settlements raised the capital requirement a mere two percent from
[03:49:14.720 --> 03:49:17.600]  six percent to eight percent but because the
[03:49:17.600 --> 03:49:22.720]  Japanese banks didn't have it they froze so that just killed the
[03:49:22.720 --> 03:49:26.240]  Japanese banks and they actually were nationalized so that
[03:49:26.240 --> 03:49:29.360]  they didn't use that term but that was the only way they could
[03:49:29.360 --> 03:49:33.520]  they could keep them alive so Japan has never recovered from that
[03:49:33.520 --> 03:49:36.800]  but we avoided it our Wall Street banks avoided it
[03:49:36.800 --> 03:49:40.160]  by getting into this whole securitization thing
[03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:44.080]  where uh the banks would bundle up loans
[03:49:44.080 --> 03:49:47.360]  and sell them off to investors well they didn't just survive they got more power
[03:49:47.360 --> 03:49:50.560]  that was their next phase to economically destroy the west
[03:49:50.560 --> 03:49:53.440]  right well then when they no longer were even going to have the loans on their
[03:49:53.440 --> 03:49:56.080]  books they didn't care what kind of what was in these
[03:49:56.080 --> 03:49:59.520]  these loans because it wasn't going to be their problem so they were doing
[03:49:59.520 --> 03:50:03.360]  subprime any anyone any borrower that walked in the door
[03:50:03.360 --> 03:50:07.360]  they would sign them up because they got they they churned the loans you know
[03:50:07.360 --> 03:50:09.920]  got fees and then they sold those as triple A
[03:50:09.920 --> 03:50:13.280]  rated certifying pure garbage this has been an amazing
[03:50:13.280 --> 03:50:15.520]  interview i look forward to having you back on
[03:50:15.520 --> 03:50:19.520]  in the future uh ellen brown people can find out more at ellen brown dot com

[03:50:26.640 --> 03:50:31.440]  but in the last 30 seconds uh how long do you think it'll be until they fully
[03:50:31.440 --> 03:50:37.120]  implode the us publicly well i'm hoping that we can what we need
[03:50:37.120 --> 03:50:41.040]  to do is set up our own independent credit system and then we can avoid that
[03:50:41.040 --> 03:50:44.800]  we if we set up our own a better mousetrap
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:49.360]  then we can let all those the big banks and the derivatives team etc collapse
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:52.640]  and we will have our own funding mechanism that's my you know what do a
[03:50:52.640 --> 03:50:56.000]  minute or two on the other side with us i want to ask you that question about

[03:54:58.400 --> 03:55:02.080]  our other states now starting to look at this because i'm hearing a lot of
[03:55:02.080 --> 03:55:05.680]  talk about the state bank of north dakota i'm hearing a lot of talk about
[03:55:05.680 --> 03:55:08.960]  trying to get legislation for the states to save themselves
[03:55:08.960 --> 03:55:12.080]  we know the states have a big appetite for tenth amendment ninth amendment
[03:55:12.080 --> 03:55:16.160]  powers right now and there's a big awakening are we seeing any movement
[03:55:16.160 --> 03:55:19.280]  towards other states setting up their own banking system
[03:55:19.280 --> 03:55:23.280]  yes yes there are actually five states that have bills pending
[03:55:23.280 --> 03:55:26.560]  three of them with full-blown bills you know that talk about where they're
[03:55:26.560 --> 03:55:30.960]  going to capital deposits and that would be michigan
[03:55:30.960 --> 03:55:35.120]  illinois and washington state and then two other states that are
[03:55:35.120 --> 03:55:39.920]  proposing to to study study such a bill and then the three other states besides
[03:55:39.920 --> 03:55:43.200]  that with that where they've discussed it in the legislature and they're talking
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:47.440]  about doing bills and there are eight candidates from all different
[03:55:47.440 --> 03:55:51.440]  persuasions i think there's three democrats two republicans
[03:55:51.440 --> 03:55:56.720]  two greens and one independent um that are all including it in in their
[03:55:56.720 --> 03:55:59.120]  platform so this is really starting to gain
[03:55:59.120 --> 03:56:01.520]  steam thanks to your work and others out there
[03:56:01.520 --> 03:56:05.280]  let me guess the federal reserve lobbyists are against this
[03:56:05.280 --> 03:56:08.960]  i i really haven't heard anyone be against it
[03:56:08.960 --> 03:56:14.000]  um i i did see one objection and in the detroit news somebody
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:17.840]  said that detroit didn't have 150 million which is what they were proposing
[03:56:17.840 --> 03:56:21.120]  for their capital base but that's what i started to say about that capital
[03:56:21.120 --> 03:56:25.280]  money that comprehensive annual financial reports that um
[03:56:25.280 --> 03:56:28.880]  rainy day fund you could tap up that money as your capital base
[03:56:28.880 --> 03:56:32.960]  even though you can't spend it you can invest it so you can invest that money
[03:56:32.960 --> 03:56:36.640]  as capital on a bank or pension funds you know they invest
[03:56:36.640 --> 03:56:40.960]  in um equity stock equity so they could do it
[03:56:40.960 --> 03:56:46.320]  all right you know joseph stiglitz said that that 700 billion that was
[03:56:46.320 --> 03:56:50.720]  put up for bailing out the bank what they should have done was use that 700
[03:56:50.720 --> 03:56:54.480]  billion as the capital for a bank and they would have seven trillion
[03:56:54.480 --> 03:56:57.840]  in credit yeah but that gives people control their own lives and makes
[03:56:57.840 --> 03:57:01.280]  government sovereign and we don't want that of course he's a two-time Nobel

[03:57:15.520 --> 03:57:19.120]  they'll distract you with the republican democrat black versus white all this
[03:57:19.120 --> 03:57:22.960]  other stuff they'll make movies like machete to glorify race war to try to
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:26.800]  get us fighting with each other and painted as liberal
[03:57:26.800 --> 03:57:30.640]  it's nothing but divide and conquer and and and clearly
[03:57:30.640 --> 03:57:33.360]  the people are now beginning to understand that we better defeat the
[03:57:33.360 --> 03:57:35.600]  new world order or none of us have any future
[03:57:35.600 --> 03:57:38.320]  these people are ruthless and they're not going to back off
