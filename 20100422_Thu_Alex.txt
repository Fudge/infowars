[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:29.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:44.000]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, Thursday, the 22nd day of April, 2010.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  Important broadcast lined up for you.
[00:46.000 --> 00:54.000]  We have Bill Murphy joining us, who heads up GATA, the Gold Antitrust Action Committee.
[00:54.000 --> 01:01.000]  A few weeks ago, they testified in Congress about clear, red-handed evidence of JPMorgan Chase
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  and others manipulating and suppressing the gold and silver market.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  He will be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  We're going to have open phones on a host of issues coming up in the next segment
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  after I go over some of the news.
[01:17.000 --> 01:28.000]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  It is Earth Day, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  That doesn't mean taking care of the Earth.
[01:34.000 --> 01:42.000]  It means learning to shut down our standard of living and become feudal slave serfs.
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.000]  It is Earth Day, my friends, and without even searching around looking for Earth Day news,
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  I saw it on ABC, I saw it on CNN, you name it.
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  There was an article, it was the headline story at CNN.com, just an hour or so ago,
[01:58.000 --> 02:07.000]  I don't know, but still the top story, that said, green sex, how to be green about your sex.
[02:07.000 --> 02:12.000]  And I knew what I was going to read as soon as I saw the headline, and sure enough,
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  buried in the middle it said, a one-child policy in America.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  And then I started looking around on some other big news sites, and guess what?
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  I saw it everywhere I looked.
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.000]  That's right.
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.000]  Have a hybrid car, have mercury-filled light bulbs, let the government raise taxes on you.
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  That will save the planet.
[02:29.000 --> 02:37.000]  And yes, one-child policy, just incredibly draconian, amazing police state promotion,
[02:37.000 --> 02:43.000]  but it's put out there all fluffy and touchy-feely and sweet for everyone.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  So we're going to be breaking down what the real environmental movement is and what it's pushing
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  and what it stands for and how it dupes a lot of well-meaning fools.
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  Also, the big central banks are pushing the global carbon taxes as one leg of their funding system
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  to shut down the real economy in their own words.
[03:00.000 --> 03:10.000]  A key article up on prisonplanet.com, bankers prepare to assault Americans with VAT transaction tax.
[03:10.000 --> 03:17.000]  And this is being simultaneously announced around the world by every major nation that is under globalist control.
[03:17.000 --> 03:26.000]  Meanwhile, Obama denies link to timing of SEC case, and he doesn't intend to give back the Goldman Sachs campaign donations.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  Also, millions face tax increases under DIM's budget plan.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  The AP is now admitting all these other hidden taxes where Obama breaks his pledge.
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  Of course, a value added affects everyone at every level, and he's saying it's definitely needed.
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  A financial VAT and a manufacturing VAT, a overall retail sales VAT.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  And they've announced today the new $100 bill.
[03:50.000 --> 03:51.000]  Looks like the euro.
[03:51.000 --> 03:52.000]  That's not me saying that.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  That's Vanity Fair, America's new $100 bill, might as well be the euro.
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  That's coming up.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  Also, Goldman and the White House connections raise eyebrows.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  Turns out they have been secretly and quietly communicating with each other.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  No kidding, they're Obama's biggest campaign donor.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  In other financial news, wholesale prices rise and marches.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  Food costs jump.
[04:16.000 --> 04:22.000]  The great recovery, and we will continue with the financial news after the break.
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  Greek debt crisis gets worse as EU revises figures.
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  And then I'm going to shift gears into groups ask DHS to suspend full-body imagers.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  I'll tell you about that contest that we've been having when I'm going to announce the winners of that and a lot more today.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  I haven't even scratched the tip of the iceberg.
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  Dick Morris last night on Fox said, Bill Clinton personally orchestrated 93 Waco, Texas, tragedy.
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.000]  Well, actually, we knew that from the congressional hearings back at the time, but this is sending shock waves to the media.
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  He said that Janet Reno was blackmailing him.
[04:58.000 --> 05:22.000]  And that's coming up as well.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  You can't feed yourself.
[05:29.000 --> 05:32.000]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000]  How much will you need?
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.000]  We don't know.
[05:41.000 --> 05:42.000]  How much do you want?
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  All you can get.
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[05:47.000 --> 05:55.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:55.000 --> 06:01.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[06:05.000 --> 06:06.000]  Tyranny is here.
[06:06.000 --> 06:10.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[06:18.000 --> 06:25.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cameras, now being expanded nationwide.
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.000]  It's here.

[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  And here's the best part.

[07:41.000 --> 07:48.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[07:48.000 --> 07:54.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[07:54.000 --> 08:22.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[08:25.000 --> 08:36.000]  It is Earth Day, 40 years of UN Club of Rome brainwashing, teaching the population that any type of economy, any type of wealth, any type of property is evil.
[08:36.000 --> 08:45.000]  If it's not in the hands of the government and the megacorporations, the control government, all over the news they're promoting one-child policies in the west.
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.000]  It's not good enough that the west is having on average 1.3 children.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  That's for every man and woman that get married or have children.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  In their lifespan, they have 1.3, not even near the replacement rate.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  You need to have two children to replace yourselves.
[09:02.000 --> 09:19.000]  If you've got two bluebirds, two swallows with golden chest, they have to have at least two more birdies, baby birds that end up getting hatched and live to be able to replace themselves.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  And it's the same thing with humans.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  And the west is dying beautifully.
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  1.3 total implosion.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  And of course it's the trendies in the west that do what the media tells them.
[09:35.000 --> 09:46.000]  And they're telling women especially how awesomely cool and radical and beautiful it is to not have children.
[09:46.000 --> 09:57.000]  Meanwhile they're pumping your vaccines and your water and your GMO food full of sterilants in case you don't make the right decision to make sure you can't have children even if you want to.
[09:57.000 --> 10:05.000]  And of course then most women wait until they're 35, 40 and then desperately want children and by then, too late, globalist win.
[10:05.000 --> 10:17.000]  Mission completed, death of the west, great victory against humanity continues.
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.000]  And so we'll be breaking that down today.
[10:24.000 --> 10:35.000]  Also the Goldman Sachs situation is developing nicely, more and more criminality is coming out.
[10:35.000 --> 10:47.000]  Of course it came out earlier in late 2009 that Geithner was giving orders to the big central banks when he was New York Fed chairman illegally not to tell the federal government where the bailout money went.
[10:47.000 --> 11:00.000]  And they still won't say he's now treasury secretary, he won't say why didn't pass taxes either he just, look I rule you, you're dumb slaves go watch a football game, a basketball game, Tiger Woods is playing golf right now.
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.000]  That's what's important Larry King, you know his wife supposedly cheated on him that is important.
[11:07.000 --> 11:21.000]  Okay, go pay attention to that, not to the fact that Goldman Sachs and others got all your major city county police fire and private pension funds, and are now openly saying they're going to quote invest it in failed banks and that you won't be getting your money.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  That is not important.
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  And if you criticize that, well that means you're violent racist.
[11:28.000 --> 11:37.000]  You're like, but what is wanting my pension fund have to do with racism, shut up, shut up racist, shut up terrorist.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.000]  If you don't shut up, you're going to cause terrorism and when it happens, it's going to be blamed on you.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  Don't protest, don't speak out, sit down and shut up now.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  Is that clear?
[11:49.000 --> 12:00.000]  Meanwhile, there is a new April 2010 violent voices anti government extremism takes on new intensity.
[12:00.000 --> 12:14.000]  And the main target of this lengthy 20 page report, the group mentioned the most is info wars.com, prison planet.com and yours truly, Alex Jones.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  It is an ADL center on extremism special report.
[12:19.000 --> 12:29.000]  There's nothing in here about Democratic Party funded groups and anarchist groups funded by foundations running around in Nazi uniforms and with Nazi signs saying they're with the tea parties.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  There's nothing about that.
[12:31.000 --> 12:46.000]  No, nothing about government murdering people or false wars or drone attacks on weddings or Iraqi children being being being fired on by Apache helicopters and the pilots laughing about it.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  Once they learn it was children.
[12:48.000 --> 13:02.000]  Nothing about that. No, it's all culling info wars.com and prison planet.com and really finding mild criticism like, man, when are the American people going to riot?
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  Like they're doing over encourages stand.
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  And oh my goodness they call for law enforcement action.
[13:10.000 --> 13:24.000]  And strangely enough, Fox News, as you know, three weeks ago wrote two different articles going off comments on info wars.com and they announced in the article that they called Homeland Security on us.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  And they implied in the article that I had said the things that were in comments.
[13:28.000 --> 13:42.000]  So finally went to comment registration and that's cleaned it up quite a bit. And then and I guess they, they, they cull through the prison planet.com forum and try to find anything mildly aggressive.
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  Meanwhile, you can go to YouTube, Google, Yahoo message boards, Fox Nation.
[13:48.000 --> 13:58.000]  Remember the Southern Poverty Law Center, Watson's doing an article on this a few months ago, had comments in there about how I should be killed.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  Now I should be murdered. But that's okay. I mean, I mean, you can have Michael Reagan saying kill 911 truthers, kill Mark Dice.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  He said, I will pay for the bullets. I'm serious. Call me. I will give you the money.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  He said that children should have hang grenades shoved into their bodies and should be detonated.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  All Palestinian children should be blown up with hang grenades. That's loving and good.
[14:19.000 --> 14:26.000]  As long as it's establishment right wing or establishment left wing, the sky's the limit, but they're getting ready to take the pension funds.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  They've already taken quite a few. You see it here and there in the news. The inflation's starting to go up. We're in a depression.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  They're going to pass all these new taxes designed to shut the economy down even faster.
[14:36.000 --> 14:44.000]  That's their stated goal is to consolidate things, drive you into bankruptcy, into government control, into servitude, into dependency.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  And they're getting ready to stage terror attacks and more provocative actions.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  And the black caucus running around inside the Tea Party is trying to start fights unsuccessfully.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  I mean, they're trying on every front right now.
[14:58.000 --> 15:09.000]  The good news is the alternative media and the aggregate is now more powerful than the mainstream media and the disinfo arms like Southern Prairie Law Center, ADL, George Soros and others.
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  And so they're failing miserably. And they've got COINTELPRO on the web trying to all get us in fighting.
[15:15.000 --> 15:22.000]  And the feds have been caught running all the major white supremacist groups and howl-turners and high-level national security FBI agents.
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.000]  Super secret. That's now in federal and state court. All admitted.
[15:27.000 --> 15:39.000]  And they're very angry at this show especially because I'm exposing their little treats, their little favorite dodie games of the Southern Prairie Law Center, the FBI, the ADL and others.
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  And I will continue to call for unity against the private central banks.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  I will continue to speak out against the New World Order.
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.000]  I will continue to refuse to engage in racial politics that you try to invoke.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  And so you will continue to say that I am calling for racial politics and racial division and then I'm calling for violence.
[15:59.000 --> 16:06.000]  And then all that happens is people who have tuned in know that it's the opposite and new listeners that tune in find out you're a pack of liars.
[16:06.000 --> 16:21.000]  So continue your lying. You couldn't be doing a better job destroying yourselves from your arrogant, hubris-filled purchase.
[16:21.000 --> 16:29.000]  Energized with bravada and a false aplomb and hutzpah and arrogance.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  I mean, what other words are there to describe it?
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  Just continue. Accelerate it. More, more, more.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  Just spew your co-intelpro lies from every direction against us.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  It is sending us the biggest audience ever.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  Lie and say I work for Israel. Lie and say I'm a Nazi.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  Lie and say I'm a Scientologist. Lie and say I'm a Communist.
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  Lie and say I work for Al Qaeda.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  Lie and say I'm a Satanist. Lie and say I'm a drug dealer.
[16:57.000 --> 17:04.000]  Say it all. It is utterly and totally ridiculous and cartoonish.
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  And every analyst I talk to in respect, and of course myself as well, I agree with them.
[17:09.000 --> 17:14.000]  You are destroying yourselves. It is desperate. It is clownish.
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  It is buffoonery to say if you don't want government healthcare, you hate black people.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  Or to say the government budget is too big, oh, you hate black people.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  Or to say you want to control our borders and cut crime, you hate Hispanics.
[17:26.000 --> 17:31.000]  It is asinine and almost everyone sees through it, and that's why your approval ratings
[17:31.000 --> 17:40.000]  and your trust ratings for media and government and all of it are plunging in free fall right now.
[17:40.000 --> 17:50.000]  And in major polls, conservatively, more than half the public know that most terrorism is government staged.
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  And people know you're getting ready to stage more terror attacks.
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  They understand that, and our people are everywhere watching.
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.000]  And you may get a little gas mileage out of it for a month or two,
[18:01.000 --> 18:07.000]  but you're not going to get three, four, five years of gas mileage out of stage terror like you've done in the past.
[18:07.000 --> 18:16.000]  The awakening and the people getting smart curve, the people recognizing scam curve,
[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  people's palate, their taste buds have become more sophisticated,
[18:22.000 --> 18:30.000]  and their smell factor, their olfactory nerve has become a lot more attuned for the smell test.
[18:30.000 --> 18:38.000]  And they smell the rotten stench of fear and wickedness and degeneracy from the New World Order.
[18:38.000 --> 18:46.000]  And we are going to rout you out by God, as Andrew Jackson said, we are going to route you out.
[18:46.000 --> 18:52.000]  And all of the enemies of the republic are now revealing themselves on every front.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  Left wing, right wing, libertarian, so-called conservative.
[18:56.000 --> 19:01.000]  All of you, because the system is desperate, they're engaged in their world government takeover right now,
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.000]  and they're hitting a lot of resistance, and the people are beginning to realize the banks are openly criminal,
[19:07.000 --> 19:13.000]  the megabanks are openly robbing everyone, and the globalists are beginning to feel the momentum massively shift against them.
[19:13.000 --> 19:19.000]  And so they are like chickens with their heads cut off, running in all directions, spraying their lifeblood out,
[19:19.000 --> 19:28.000]  and it is quite a spectacle to behold, and to see all the enemies of the republic revealing themselves right now,
[19:28.000 --> 19:36.000]  to see the sheep from the goats being divided, the wheat from the chaff, the gold from the pot metal,
[19:36.000 --> 19:43.000]  to see it all dividing right now, and to see the battle accelerating and being joined,
[19:43.000 --> 19:51.000]  and to see all the great allies of liberty that are coming out into the open, to see the battle lines drawn, it is a beautiful thing.
[19:51.000 --> 20:01.000]  We'll get into the global government tax takeover, what's happening with Goldman Sachs, Earth Day, one-shot policies, all of it straight ahead.
[20:01.000 --> 20:08.000]  It's no secret why pharmaceutical companies and mainstream media often question the safety and effectiveness of herbal supplements.
[20:08.000 --> 20:17.000]  But isn't it ironic that mainstream pharmaceutical companies are the ones who manufacture over-priced prescription drugs that produce dangerous side effects?
[20:17.000 --> 20:22.000]  Do your own research and compare the herbal supplements offered at ResearchedHerbs.com.

[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[21:26.000 --> 21:34.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[22:27.000 --> 22:32.000]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.

[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  Herb Kay was right. His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.000]  What have you got to lose? Stop the calls now. Get out of debt and have more money.

[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  That's 800-822-1291.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  Call 800-822-1291.
[24:17.000 --> 24:24.000]  While everyone's worried about Larry King's 8th wife or whatever it is cheating on him with a baseball coach.
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.000]  Or the latest with Ann and Nicole Smith lawsuits or what's happening with American Idol.
[24:31.000 --> 24:42.000]  A new level of world government, really the crowning capstone is being placed right now.
[24:42.000 --> 24:51.000]  With a global cartel of private banks signing a worldwide constitution between the G20
[24:51.000 --> 25:01.000]  to levy VAT taxes, financial VAT taxes, manufacturing VAT taxes, energy VAT taxes.
[25:01.000 --> 25:11.000]  And simultaneously every western nation is passing or has passed laws that they admit mesh into the international agreement.
[25:11.000 --> 25:18.000]  And much of the money, but more importantly all of the regulatory power is given to the private central banks.
[25:18.000 --> 25:26.000]  Just like in 1996 they gave the World Trade Organization more power than our Congress over our trade.
[25:26.000 --> 25:33.000]  This is happening right now and almost no one is talking about it.
[25:33.000 --> 25:43.000]  I was searching around this morning and found some banking associations in Texas that were saying this will allow the big mega banks to come in and take over our local banks that are healthy.
[25:43.000 --> 25:51.000]  We don't invest in derivatives. This is unfair trade practices and in a calm business like way.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  In fact, I am Watson those articles, but I don't think I am them to you.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  Will you ask him to send me those Texas articles by banking associations?
[25:59.000 --> 26:07.000]  Ask Watson to I am those back to you so that I can have those guys.
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.000]  So we've got to somehow ring the alarm here.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  We have to somehow tell the people what's going on because they have no idea.
[26:18.000 --> 26:24.000]  The way most of the TV news is framing it is Obama getting tough on the banks.
[26:24.000 --> 26:39.000]  Man, he started a civil investigation of Goldman Sachs, which is as rigged as the worst used car sales lot or some carnival game.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  They're saying Obama getting tough. He's got a bill.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  Senator Dodd is going to really get the bankers and there won't be any more bailouts.
[26:49.000 --> 26:58.000]  You won't have bailout money that is really tax money going to the banks. They'll just directly get the money now.
[26:58.000 --> 27:08.000]  This is completely and totally over the top, but they're using people's ignorance and lack of knowledge of how the international financial system works to do this.
[27:08.000 --> 27:16.000]  And so Paul Watson's got a key article breaking all this down at prisonplanet.com right now.
[27:16.000 --> 27:27.000]  Steve Watson is doing another story that's going to be out in the next few hours on this front.
[27:27.000 --> 27:36.000]  And we're also going to get into a new article up on prisonplanet.com. It just went up minutes ago.
[27:36.000 --> 27:43.000]  ADL calls for major law enforcement operation to deal with Obamacare critics.
[27:43.000 --> 27:52.000]  Yes, attack group mixes in completely nonviolent internet postings with death threats in new purge against internet descent.
[27:52.000 --> 27:58.000]  All of this online with internet censorship that cybersecurity is setting up.
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  So we'll cover that as well coming up the next hour. I do want to take some calls first.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  And so what we'll do is we'll come back. We will go to your phone calls.
[28:08.000 --> 28:17.000]  We have a full board of calls. I said wide open phones, but after this board is gone, any new callers, it'll be first time callers today.
[28:17.000 --> 28:30.000]  1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  And coming up, creating a list of political dissidents. Good enough for the Nazis.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  Good enough for the Southern Priority Law Center.
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  Another excellent article by Steve Watson up on prisonplanet.com.
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  And of course yours truly listed prominently in the hit list.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  I'm number 13. Lucky 13.
[28:47.000 --> 28:54.000]  I'm also, the news is reported on the internal White House hit list. Isn't that nice?
[28:54.000 --> 29:00.000]  Isn't it nice? I'm just here saying, look, Goldman Sachs and others are robbing us.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  They're setting up a global tax system where we pay taxes to them.
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  I mean, I was reading what the CFR was saying years ago.
[29:06.000 --> 29:15.000]  Now, once they imploded the economy, they'd bring in a VAT tax, a carbon tax, a financial VAT, a Tobin tax.
[29:15.000 --> 29:21.000]  But a Tobin tax paid to the bankers. You have to understand, select groups of elite banks can selectively.
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.000]  This is in the London Guardian, by the way, but they say how great it is.
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  Go after their competition and basically shut it down. So that is all coming up as well.
[29:32.000 --> 29:41.000]  And then in the third hour, we've got the head of GATA, the Gold Antitrust Group, joining us, Bill Murphy,
[29:41.000 --> 29:50.000]  about red-handed fraud and price-fixing by JPMorgan Chase and others on the gold-silver markets. Stay with us.
[29:50.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:07.000]  What's your home worth? How can you compare local real estate agents and how do you get MLS listings for the entire country?
[30:07.000 --> 30:15.000]  If you're thinking of buying a home to take advantage of a tax credit or selling your house, you first need to see an incredible website called HomeGain.com.
[30:15.000 --> 30:21.000]  HomeGain.com will help you find a realtor to buy or sell a home. It's so easy and best of all, it's free.

[31:22.000 --> 31:33.000]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[31:33.000 --> 31:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[31:42.000 --> 31:48.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[31:48.000 --> 31:58.000]  Invisible Empire, secure your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or watch it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[32:19.000 --> 32:27.000]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants. The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[32:30.000 --> 32:38.000]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality and joy.
[32:38.000 --> 32:43.000]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use and store it.
[32:43.000 --> 32:53.000]  Go to Linda's website ofthefield.com and take advantage of special offers or if you're not online, call her 24-hour toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[32:53.000 --> 33:16.000]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE. A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[33:16.000 --> 33:31.000]  Here's a Mason County news article by Eric Sandberg, president and CEO of Texas Bankers Association of Austin.
[33:31.000 --> 33:38.000]  And it says, op-ed, too politically connected to fail. I'm glad people are starting to get this.
[33:38.000 --> 33:49.000]  The Obama administration, Democratic congressional leaders are misleading the American public. Their financial regulatory reform bill, which could soon reach the Senate floor, is promoted as protecting consumers from fat cat bankers.
[33:49.000 --> 34:05.000]  Unfortunately, the bill takes aim at the wrong parties and comes down against the state's traditional community banks, the ones that did not cause the economic mess in the first place and exempts most of the investment banks in broker-dealer activities that were responsible for the financial collapse.
[34:05.000 --> 34:19.000]  There, it's said very simply there, isn't it? And, of course, it has a financial VAT on all financial activities at the international level and national level.
[34:19.000 --> 34:34.000]  And it is meant for the financial takeover artists to be able to shut down any free market banking going on in this country. And it's particularly aimed at Texas banks, the healthiest in the nation.
[34:34.000 --> 34:44.000]  We have the healthiest private banks in the country, in this state, and openly, the globalists are in barons, you name it, saying they want to gobble these up.
[34:44.000 --> 34:55.000]  Imagine all the Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase regulators that are alumni of those criminal organizations. They cannot wait. They cannot wait to come in.
[34:55.000 --> 35:04.000]  And the public doesn't know the difference, so they'll enjoy that. Just amazing. So, as I said, that is coming up in the next hour.
[35:04.000 --> 35:16.000]  Bankers prepare to assault Americans with VAT transaction taxes. And then, of course, it's also going on at the international level as reported new global fat tax to rein in banks.
[35:16.000 --> 35:31.000]  If you read the article, it gives them total power to take over society. We'll also break down what's happening with Goldman Sachs right now in this fake investigation for political purposes that Barack Obama, a.k.a. Barry Saturo, is launching right now.
[35:31.000 --> 35:37.000]  And, of course, the ADL demonization, the Southern Property Law Center demonization, going into high gear.
[35:37.000 --> 35:48.000]  We're going to go ahead and go to your calls. What happened is, for those that didn't hear the day I discussed it a week ago, we had the $15,000 contest.
[35:48.000 --> 35:56.000]  We've had, I don't know, four other contests before that. This was the biggest. And I kept wondering why we weren't really getting any submissions.
[35:56.000 --> 36:07.000]  We're getting very few. And it was because our spam blocker in our email, and we have to have it because we get three, four thousand emails a day, viagra ads, mortgage ads.
[36:07.000 --> 36:12.000]  I mean, you get them. People with little email accounts probably get, what, 100 spams a day, even with your blockers on.
[36:12.000 --> 36:24.000]  Because it was called Naked Body Scanner Contest, people would put that in the subject line. And so we didn't discover this until the day before the contest was to end last week.
[36:24.000 --> 36:36.000]  And so I announced that sometime this week, I would announce the winners. I have been so busy, I've watched all the entries, but I have to watch them all again.
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.000]  There's more than 50 good ones, just to one of the contests. And I'm going to try to watch them tonight.
[36:42.000 --> 36:49.000]  I just want to be fair in the judging. And I almost always end up announcing the winner late just because we get sometimes hundreds of entries.
[36:49.000 --> 36:58.000]  This time all totaled. It's around 100 with the three different contests. 50 good ones just on the big $10,000 prize, the Naked Body Scanner Contest.
[36:58.000 --> 37:11.000]  There was two others. And so I'll be announcing that either tomorrow or Sunday or Monday. I'm not sure because I've just got to really get it down to, you know, two or three in each contest that I think are the best.
[37:11.000 --> 37:23.000]  But then I'm going to have the guys and the gals here in the office take a look at it and see what they think as I like to get their input. And then we'll be announcing those winners as we always do late just because we're victims of our own success.
[37:23.000 --> 37:33.000]  So many come in. And then this time with the spam blocker, I was starting to panic. I was like, man, I'm putting $15,000 out here to get the word out against the Naked Body Scanners.
[37:33.000 --> 37:41.000]  This thing's a failure. Our first contest, it was a failure. Well, it was not a failure. It was just a computer snafu.
[37:41.000 --> 37:48.000]  Once we learned that hundreds of emails had been blocked and were in the junk folder, we were able to retrieve them.
[37:48.000 --> 38:03.000]  And if you have not seen us post your entry since we learned this a week and a half ago, be sure and send it again to contestedinfowars.com. And we'll do one more sweep today to see if we missed any of them.
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  We haven't seen us in five different waves the last week and a half because I don't want to post all the entries on one page because then people don't have a tendency to watch them all.
[38:10.000 --> 38:21.000]  So I like to post them, you know, 5, 10, 15 at a time. If you haven't seen yours posted, you've got until, I don't know, six o'clock or so tonight to get those into the email.
[38:21.000 --> 38:29.000]  So I have a chance to do one more sweep and make sure that we did see all of the entries.
[38:29.000 --> 38:46.000]  One more program note, getting a lot of great reviews for police state for the rise of FEMA. It's now out on DVD shipping out to everyone. You can order the high quality DVD with the expanded extras at infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[38:46.000 --> 38:55.000]  You can also write to us at PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760. The old addresses will not work.
[38:55.000 --> 39:03.000]  And we had a forwarding the last six months, but now that's over. You've got to send it to PO Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[39:03.000 --> 39:15.000]  And of course you can watch both Invisible Empire and PS4 at PrisonPlanet.tv. 15 cents a day, 5.95 a month takes about one minute to sign up and you can share your passcode with as many as six people.
[39:15.000 --> 39:24.000]  So you're really getting six memberships for the price of 5.95 and that just pays for the bandwidth. So you can see the films in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[39:24.000 --> 39:35.000]  Okay, without further ado, I want to take a lot of phone calls now on any issue you wish you'd discuss into the next hour and then I'm going to break down the biggest issue out there.
[39:35.000 --> 39:44.000]  Well, there's several. The bankers are taken over completely. I mean, they've already had control, but now they really want to rape people and they're going to stage terror attacks to blame it on their opposition.
[39:44.000 --> 39:55.000]  It's a legitimate opposition that's saying, hey, you're criminals. And the criminals are saying, okay, the people are criticizing us. That's going to cause federal buildings to be blown up. And when they're blown up, it's our competition's fault.
[39:55.000 --> 40:03.000]  We're the big bankers that finance all the big wars and invade countries and kill millions of people and are totally ruthless and take old ladies' houses and family farms.
[40:03.000 --> 40:13.000]  But we don't stage terror attacks. It's our opposition. They're going to do it. Get ready. It's about to happen and we're going to have to shut down freedom on the Internet and arrest a bunch of people, especially that Alex Jones.
[40:13.000 --> 40:23.000]  He's calling for violence. And the Tea Parties are racist. Look, they're wearing Nazi uniforms. Oh, wait, those guys actually work for us. Never mind that. We're good.
[40:23.000 --> 40:36.000]  So that's the big issue. There is a revolution, an offshore banking takeover happening. I know it just keeps saying that like a parrot, but I mean, I'm here saying alert, alert. We're under attack. It's happening.
[40:36.000 --> 40:52.000]  Oh, my gosh, the new orders here warn everyone. Stop them. Stop them. And the system is saying, oh, you want to call the bankers out? You are a terrorist, Mr. Jones. You're calling for violence. You're a racist. You're a Nazi.
[40:52.000 --> 41:01.000]  And because they know that doesn't work on most of the public, they come from the other angle with their government-run white supremacist groups going, Jones works for Israel. Kill him. Get him.
[41:01.000 --> 41:13.000]  I mean, it's just unbelievable what's going on right now. But that's because we're hitting on all cylinders, ladies and gentlemen. We are in the pole position to win the race. And the system is angry.
[41:13.000 --> 41:20.000]  They're always going after number one. Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in West Virginia. Dave, you're on the air. Welcome.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  Hey, Alex. It's a pleasure to talk to you. Thanks for the red pill, by the way.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  You bet, brother. Pass them out.
[41:26.000 --> 41:37.000]  Anyway, I woke up really to the sigh-off that Glenn Beck is the controlled opposition, especially with the Deborah Medina 9-11 truth thing.
[41:37.000 --> 41:56.000]  And that really gave me insight into the psychological operation that he is. He feeds you a lot of white propaganda or truth to set you up for the black propaganda or lies that manipulate the way you look at the world.
[41:56.000 --> 42:16.000]  One thing, he kind of reversed himself on the FEMA camp thing today on his show. He had recording of the Acorn president giving a speech that was saying that interment camps in the near future could be much worse than what they were during World War II.
[42:16.000 --> 42:24.000]  And he kept saying, I've debunked that. I've debunked that. But then he said, but the FEMA camp structure is in place.
[42:24.000 --> 42:39.000]  We'll see. We'll see. I mean, here's the deal. I want to embrace anyone who stands up against torture, illegal wars, violations of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Patriot Act.
[42:39.000 --> 42:54.000]  I don't want to fight with Glenn Beck. I mean, I won't sell out my values. I won't compromise. But at the same time, as a syndicated radio host, it is not good for getting on radio stations on average to attack Glenn Beck.
[42:54.000 --> 43:04.000]  It would be much easier if I just wanted to be a big shot to kind of not attack anybody, tow the party line, kind of shut up, and I'd be on 600 radio stations.
[43:04.000 --> 43:16.000]  I mean, I've been given the offers by the very people that, well, I'm not going to get into it. The point is, so it's not me here mad at Glenn Beck because he makes $50 million a year.
[43:16.000 --> 43:23.000]  I could care less about that. All that matters to me is the truth. I could have been Glenn Beck. I mean, I was given the offers.
[43:23.000 --> 43:36.000]  I was told you'll be bigger than Rush Limbaugh by people that could do it. I was guaranteed. I mean, I was offered millions of dollars multiple times, guaranteed that I would be the next Glenn Beck before Glenn Beck was even on the radar screen.
[43:36.000 --> 43:46.000]  So that's why I know who Glenn Beck is because I was given the opportunity, basically like Anakin Skywalker to become Darth Vader. And I did not become Darth Vader.
[43:46.000 --> 43:56.000]  And so what I'm telling people is I know Darth Vader when I see it. And again, he sits there and he gets people's confidence at key points.
[43:56.000 --> 44:10.000]  And then he attacks Ron Paul and Ron Paul had a chance to win in the primaries or he comes out and skillfully says there are no camps when in Congress they've already built them and it's in the Wall Street Journal and it's in the Houston Chronicle and we send him all that.
[44:10.000 --> 44:21.000]  And for months, he said I'm investigating it and then he came out and did strawman attacks going after reports on camps that I had identified as fraudulent over a decade ago.
[44:21.000 --> 44:32.000]  And so I know what he's going to do before he does it. Also, you notice that the left always is invoking racism and saying anyone that criticizes is race.
[44:32.000 --> 44:45.000]  Well, then when you turn into Beck, almost said Obama, he's always talking about Van Jones or Black Panthers and saying they're communists, they're gutter radicals and there's going to be a new Malcolm X on the scene.
[44:45.000 --> 44:56.000]  So he is invoking race very, very skillfully. And I mean, just to make it clear, two people I know are Psyops and that's Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck.
[44:56.000 --> 45:07.000]  I don't believe Limbaugh is a Psyop. He's just a Republican, you know, operative. And I don't believe Michael Savage is, though he's got some major problems, at least he'll tell the truth about government-sponsored terror.
[45:07.000 --> 45:17.000]  And he doesn't, you know, he criticized Bush heavily. He was against the banker bailout, so was Limbaugh. But see, Beck was for the banker bailout.
[45:17.000 --> 45:26.000]  See, that's the difference. And so when you really have been watching him for years, you know what he's doing because the globalists have fallback positions.
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.000]  They're going to demonize populace from a left perspective to make leftists think it's a right-wing movement so they don't join.
[45:32.000 --> 45:41.000]  And then they're also going to have a Beck who's there to pose as the Uber patriot so he can then attack 9-11 truth and libertarian-type groups. Go ahead.
[45:41.000 --> 45:50.000]  Yeah, he sets you up and, you know, he sets you up with truth. That's what, like, people got to understand. You like what he says.
[45:50.000 --> 46:01.000]  And it is, it's white propaganda, it's truth, but it's to set you up for the black. And if you read about, I would encourage listeners to look up and read up on Psyops.
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.000]  It really will awaken you to the whole game that's being played.
[46:05.000 --> 46:11.000]  There's white propaganda, gray propaganda, and black propaganda. It has nothing to do with white people or black people.
[46:11.000 --> 46:17.000]  It's the different types of propaganda that are out there.
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.000]  And I don't want to spend too much time on Beck, but that is interesting because it's pointless.
[46:23.000 --> 46:31.000]  The new film, Police State for the Rise of FEMA at the end, has a 10-minute section debunking him on the FEMA camps.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  We show you all the evidence, the congressional testimony, the news articles, actual video of FEMA camps.
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.000]  We show how the government admits sports stadiums are emergency camps. You know, they can use a baseball field as a camp.
[46:42.000 --> 46:49.000]  You know, you get two hours and 10-plus minutes of documentation, then we show you his Psyop.
[46:49.000 --> 46:57.000]  But you're saying Beck came out today and said, well, there aren't camps, but they have the system in place.
[46:57.000 --> 47:02.000]  Well, I mean, obviously, it doesn't mean that everyone's in the camps. That's our whole point.
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  People keep saying, well, where are they? Where are the trucks? Where are the people?
[47:06.000 --> 47:11.000]  We already have the biggest prison population in the world. They're already putting people in prison for almost no reason.
[47:11.000 --> 47:16.000]  They're calling for arresting political dissidents. They're marking them, putting them in databases.
[47:16.000 --> 47:22.000]  They're having military drills on locking down cities. The point is, they've put it in place. Go ahead.
[47:22.000 --> 47:30.000]  Well, he ended the show with saying the danger of the system being built with the tracking of movements with your cell phones
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.000]  and the reading of emails. He said, you know, just imagine this system in the wrong hands.
[47:35.000 --> 47:42.000]  So, like, I was wondering, like, how is he setting up the audience with kind of reversing himself
[47:42.000 --> 47:48.000]  and kind of, you know, hitting on the truth that you hit on? You know, I'm trying to look through the side.
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  Well, here's what's happened. Here's what's happened. And this was reported by Arbitron,
[47:52.000 --> 47:59.000]  and it was reported by Nielsen last week. I happened across the ratings, and I went directly to the main sites.
[47:59.000 --> 48:07.000]  He's lost about 20% of his radio listeners the last two months, and he's lost about half his TV viewers the last two months.
[48:07.000 --> 48:14.000]  He's gone from right at 4 million to less than 2 million on TV. And so Beck is in free fall right now.
[48:14.000 --> 48:21.000]  I mean, look, I, 10 years ago, more than 10, like, 11 years ago, 12 years ago,
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.000]  I would play clips on my radio show of Bill O'Reilly saying, this guy's great.
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.000]  Now, he was talking about the New World Order, the Illuminati, but he only did it for a year or two to get an audience.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  And see, it's the same thing. I mean, think of what Bill O'Reilly has turned into. See?
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.000]  And then notice now his ratings have dropped, and so he's attached himself to Beck.
[48:42.000 --> 48:50.000]  And so that's what's happening. Plus, millions of his listeners went out and found the Civilian Inmate Labor Camp program.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  They went and found the National Emergency Centers Act. They went and found the Congressional testimony.
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.000]  They went and found the Miami Herald and the Houston Chronicle and the Wall Street Journal saying,
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  oh, yeah, here's the purchase orders for million man camps and for daring emergencies and for holding the American people.
[49:05.000 --> 49:11.000]  And now the public's reading the Violent Belligerence Act bill, and the public is just reading this going,
[49:11.000 --> 49:18.000]  what do you mean they're not doing this? And so he's getting hit by his listeners every day in emails and calls going,
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  hey, Glenn, Northwoods is real.
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.000]  Well, so again, I don't want to talk about Glenn Beck all day. God Blessing.
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.000]  You know what? He's being set up for a fall as well. He's being targeted.
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  Also, what's happening is this is a hot takeover, and I appreciate your call, Dave. This is a hot takeover.
[49:38.000 --> 49:45.000]  This isn't a slow, creeping, big government takeover. We've seen the last, you know, 97 years since the Federal Reserve took over.
[49:45.000 --> 49:52.000]  A lot of mid-level elites, and that means people with 100 million bucks, you know, people that are powerful, people that run in the highest channels,
[49:52.000 --> 49:59.000]  they're finding out that they're not going to be part of the capstone, that they're going to have their money taken, that their kids are going to be slaves.
[49:59.000 --> 50:09.000]  And so what's happening is executives are starting to almost subconsciously rebel and let big national hosts go further.
[50:09.000 --> 50:17.000]  Okay, I mean, because I've talked to mid-level radio executives, high-level radio executives, high-level media that report on the radio industry.
[50:17.000 --> 50:23.000]  I mean, they're constantly contacting me, and they, you know, they say this is off record, right? And I say yes, so then I can't tell you their name.
[50:23.000 --> 50:29.000]  You know, that's my journalist hat. But they're, they're scared. I mean, they understand this is all real.
[50:29.000 --> 50:42.000]  And so they're beginning to really, what we've been saying, they're making a choice. And so let's give back the benefit of the doubt.
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  I mean, there's lots of flip-flopping that goes on in a war.
[50:46.000 --> 50:57.000]  Let's give him the benefit of the doubt and encourage him to cover the police state, to cover the casual society surveillance grid, to cover FEMA camps.
[50:57.000 --> 51:18.000]  I mean, let's give him the benefit of the doubt. We'll be right back.
[51:27.000 --> 51:35.000]  You save even more with your first $8 auction purchase.
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  That's dublishoppers.com. You'll be glad you did.
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  They helped to create a new world order.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  We are part of a new world order.
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[52:13.000 --> 52:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:20.000 --> 52:26.000]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[52:26.000 --> 52:34.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  So it's going to be an inner, ruling elite, and then everyone else.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  Invisible Empire.

[52:59.000 --> 53:04.000]  Oh, my sinuses. They feel like they'll explode.
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  Sinus pressure. Sinus headaches that keep you up at night. You've struggled for years.
[53:08.000 --> 53:14.000]  You've tried everything to get relief, but your sinus distress just keeps coming back and robbing you of the healthy life you deserve.
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  Sound familiar? Well, you're not alone.
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.000]  Sinuses make show that 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  Fact is, 67 products merely treat the symptoms and don't get to the cause of your sinus problem.
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  Now there's a solution that's safe and doctor recommended.

[54:14.000 --> 54:18.000]  Well, I wanted to take a lot of calls. I'm taking one call and I went off into a whole glim-back discussion
[54:18.000 --> 54:23.000]  and I got cut off by the break to finish my statement.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  Now I say give them the benefit of the doubt.
[54:25.000 --> 54:30.000]  We know he's a weasel. We know he's a sidewinder.
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  But there are worse things in the world than glim-back.
[54:33.000 --> 54:39.000]  I mean, he does serve the purpose of awakening people to some of the bad things that are going on.
[54:39.000 --> 54:42.000]  I mean, certainly better than the Southern Prairie Law Center and the ADL.
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  That's why they're attacking them.
[54:44.000 --> 54:50.000]  You know, he plays the role of kind of being the gatekeeper for the libertarian constitutionalist awakening.
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.000]  But people have already pretty much woken up to that.
[54:53.000 --> 55:03.000]  And so it's just our job to put pressure on him to not engage in treacherous activity.
[55:03.000 --> 55:11.000]  And then the next time he does, it'll be that much more clear to people.
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  I mean, I want to focus on the banking takeover that's happening right now.
[55:14.000 --> 55:19.000]  We need to get glim-back to explain that, and this is Gordon Brown's own words,
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  that the government is being established by a global constitution of the G20 private central banks that they represent.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  And they're going to put value-added taxes on everything we do.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  But then again, I remember what glim-back's doing. He's been promoting VAT.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  Should I play that video again? Play that audio again?
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  I guess he is just pure evil.
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  See, I'm trying to be nice here, folks.
[55:43.000 --> 55:48.000]  But then I say, hey, we got to reach out to glim-back and get him to expose the banking takeover right now.
[55:48.000 --> 55:53.000]  And how this is not Obama trying to reign in the banks.
[55:53.000 --> 55:58.000]  And then I go, wait a minute, he's not going to do that. He's been toeing the line.
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  All right, now I've really gone off the deep end here talking about glim-back.
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  I don't want to discuss it anymore, okay? I just don't want to talk about him.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  I want to talk about issues. I want to talk about what's happening.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  I want to warn people and move forward.
[56:13.000 --> 56:19.000]  But yes, if we could get Rush Limbaugh, if we could get glim-back to talk about what's really happening with the banking takeover,
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  we could stop the global government.
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  But, you know, Limbaugh won't say there's a world government.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  So even when it's being announced, so there you go again.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  At least Michael Savage will.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  I just want to save the country and defeat the New World Order.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  I want to jump up and down and praise these mega-talk show hosts.
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  I just want my country back. I don't want to be a slave.
[56:44.000 --> 56:50.000]  And it's disgusting to watch him masquerading as patriots. I'm sick of it.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  Let's go to Todd and Georgia. Todd, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  Hey, I saw your film, Police Day 4, yesterday.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  But I was looking at it, and midway through, I was just like,
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  they're going to do the same thing here as they are doing in the Middle East.
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  And so I have a couple questions. One question is, if you say that it's the same people
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  that tried to put in the New World Order at Hitler,
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  how are we going to stop their influence forever?
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  And then, second of all, how do we halt this incremental takeover?
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  And how can we revoke the powers of these private companies,
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  such as, you know, just all the private companies that are involved
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.000]  just corrupt and permanently taking over?
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  Well, again, this is not my opinion.
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  It's in hundreds and hundreds of white papers.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  It's in Carol Quigley's tragedy and hope, and he was a historian for the globalist.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  That's on record.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  That they fund anything that is command and control.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  Communism, socialism, fascism.
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.000]  They fund both sides or three sides of wars.
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.000]  And that's on record.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  Anthony Sutton and others got the government documents that our government,
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  the British government, funded Hitler.
[57:54.000 --> 57:55.000]  Smedley Butler went public.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  Two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner.
[57:58.000 --> 57:59.000]  Top Marine.
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  He was going to be Marine Corps Commandant.
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  They wanted him to carry out a fascist coup.
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  He said, no.
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  But the bankers are smart.
[58:07.000 --> 58:08.000]  They then fund the communists.
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  I mean, again, they're masters at trying to control every major movement.
[58:12.000 --> 58:19.000]  And, yes, they're going to try to set up the same kind of police state that did in Nazi Germany.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  I mean, folks, the 1968 Gun Control Act that Senator Dodd got passed,
[58:23.000 --> 58:26.000]  the deceased Senator Dodd, not the current one,
[58:26.000 --> 58:33.000]  is a word-for-word translation into English of the 1928 German anti-gun law
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  that Hitler then expanded.
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  And, of course, Senator Dodd was on the Nuremberg trial.
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  That's where he learned about it.
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:45.000 --> 58:50.000]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[58:52.000 --> 58:57.000]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[58:57.000 --> 59:02.000]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[59:02.000 --> 59:03.000]  It's true.
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[59:08.000 --> 59:13.000]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[59:15.000 --> 59:20.000]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[59:20.000 --> 59:24.000]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[59:28.000 --> 59:31.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[59:33.000 --> 59:38.000]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[59:38.000 --> 59:42.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[59:42.000 --> 59:47.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[59:47.000 --> 59:50.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  Hour number two, TJ, Joshua, John, Thomas, and others.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  Your calls are coming up right now.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  We've now got more mainstream articles and the document itself confirming world government is officially
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  being established, a global private banking dictatorship in the next month.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  And there's almost no one out there breaking down what's really happening, which is horrifying.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  We need to get everyone we can alerted to this situation right now.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  And a new ADL demonization piece on myself and others, very, very scary, calling for law enforcement action against us.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  It's getting pretty scary here, pretty exciting as well.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  But let's go back to your calls.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  TJ in Minnesota, thanks for holding her on the air, TJ.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  It's my privilege to hold for you, Alex, and Rick Jones.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  You know, I only call you every two or three years.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  I talked to a friend of yours earlier this morning about an hour ago, and I really need your help.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  And I consider you an egocentric necessary bulldog for the restoration of the Republican human rights in the North American continent.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  That's a gross summation.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  Ego-centric.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  That's fancy.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  But it's necessary.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  I mean, John Paul Jones hosted that flag, I think, with a snake on it and said,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  don't you dare tread on my posterior, and you're like-minded, and you say so, and you're not afraid to.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  But the favor I have to ask of you, I need to talk to James Janos, a.k.a. Jesse Ventura.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  Within the next 60 days, and you can call me privately, you can ask Mike, you can ask other people in Austin,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  because this is getting really serious, and I don't care about bankers.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Bankers are only relative to people that have money or fiat currency, and appreciate that more than life.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  Let's be clear, I get calls every day from me and other people asking for Jesse Ventura's home phone number.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  People that want to get a hold of me to try to get a hold of him through Sky Horse Publishing, that's the best way.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  And I am friends.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  I can say I'm good friends with Jesse Ventura, know him well, know his son well, and we're becoming really good friends.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  But I don't hardly ever call Jesse.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  I don't ask for anything.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  He's out in Los Angeles right now.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  They're working on starting up the production of the next season of the TV show.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  And I mean, you imagine if I just call up Jesse Ventura and say, hey, a caller from Minnesota wants to talk to you.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  I mean, it's just not my place.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  But I mean, you say you're in a lot of trouble.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  I mean, what's going on?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Well, we've been in trouble for...
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  No, I mean, let's say you're talking to Jesse Ventura.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  I mean, talk to him right now on air.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  And Jesse, James, I'm just south of that Iron Curtain border of Iowa, Minnesota.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  I know all about IBM, the male clinic.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  Why you went to Mexico and I went ahead of you.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  I know you're a friend, Keith, who I talked to before I went into exile.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  I know Sheila Cascade and the state senator who knows what I know.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  And we got to discuss this so it can be part of your next book, Jesse.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  And you can call me by his Alex Jones or his friend.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Well, why don't you send me an email off record with what the specifics of the information are?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  You every two or three years.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  But let's hope that Jesse got that message.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  And...
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Well, TJ, you need to be more specific.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  So why don't you send us an email?
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  You can send it to show tips and just say it's off record.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  And then I'll look at what the information is.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  You're called.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  I need to call Ventura more.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  I need to talk to him more.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  That was about a couple of weeks ago.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  They've been calling me for a couple of days and I hadn't even checked my voicemail.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  They know they were calling me.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  So I've got my own life, my own operation, my own things I'm doing.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  And I'm not my brother's keeper.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  And that's really the frustration though.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  We get so much information and most of it really good.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  And make a YouTube video, expose it, whatever it is, get it out there.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  Okay, Joshua, John, Thomas, Casey and others.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  Your calls are straight ahead. 1-800-259-9231.

[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  And I'll close this how a casual society surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  This film needs to be seen. Everybody needs to get it.

[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Now something fun. It's springtime.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  Here's the plan.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  When you add a one-month superfood spring pack to your food storage,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  we'll send you that garden of non-high-bread seeds absolutely free.

[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  Call 800-409-5633 eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  We are continuing with your phone calls.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  Then I'm going to get into the economic takeover by the private central banking system that is now at a critical juncture.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  And the word is starting to get out. I want to commend the listeners.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  This is very important information. I cannot overstate how important it is.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  And of course, the government stage terror attacks that could happen any day or any month or any year,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  but we're definitely in a prime zone for it right now.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  We also have people from inside the Clinton administration, Dick Morris, saying that Janet Reno blackmailed him.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  And that was the intel that we got from multiple sources in the years after Waco.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  And that's what also came out in congressional testimony that Clinton was running an operation.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  So very powerful information on that front. Very important info.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Let's go to Joshua in Virginia. You're on the air.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  Hi Alex.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  Welcome.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  First time caller.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  Just want to start by saying thank you for what you do.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  My question involves a small newsletter I've started, just kind of like a one page deal that I put out as a flyer and hand out to folks in email.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  And I try to bring people's interest in and focus on stuff that has to do with health,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  because I know that will kind of bring them in and then I could get them in more advanced knowledge after that.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  But the question I have today is just I've never heard you talk about food grade hydrogen peroxide.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  Do you have any comments to make on that? And that's pretty much the reason for my call.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  Well, we've talked to some medical doctors and others that say it has a lot of health benefits.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  But I mean, we have folks on with different perspectives on that.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  We defend and promote alternative medicine from the onslaught that it's under right now.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  But there's also a lot of quackery out there, but I haven't seen that in association with food grade hydrogen peroxide.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Okay. Anything on colloidal gold? I mean, we talk a lot about colloidal silver and I've just recently heard about colloidal gold.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  All right. Well, I'll give you my take on that.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  Colloidal silver in really high amounts can have some toxic effects, but in low amounts, it's very, very beneficial because it works against viruses and bacteria.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  And we've had there's patented medical reports on that.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  Colloidal gold also very powerful antibiotic, but more toxic and more easy to get poisoning from colloidal gold from the studies I've seen.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  So you got to be careful with the colloidal gold and use it sparingly.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  But that is not medical advice. That is what I understand.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Okay. So go do your own research.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  Let's talk to John in Texas. You're on the air, John.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  Hi, Alex.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  Hello, sir.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  Well, eight months ago, a woman in our church went to see a pastor.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  He was going around to different churches giving talks about the new world order, I guess.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  And she came back and she told me that this pastor said that there were stockpiling guillotines in the country.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  Now, that's the oldest, oldest rumor on the planet.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  I mean, literally, I've seen reports of that from 30 years ago.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  It's one of the oldest Patriot rumors.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  I have no doubt that the government, you know, has such things.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  We know they have the plastic coffins, the mass grave plans.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  I've gotten, you know, Bureau of Cemetery's documents from California and New York in just the last year and a half.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  And Ted Gunnerson says he has confirmed reports of guillotines and I'm not saying he's lying.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  I think Ted's a good guy, you know, with his track record.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  But I don't know about guillotines.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  Even when she told me, I didn't believe it, but man, it sort of sounds far-fetched, you know, but when I heard Ted Gunnerson mention it the other day,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  and I went to Google and typed in guillotines in America, they had some stuff on there about it.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  But there's another one I always hear.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  And it could be New Mexico, it could be Georgia, it could be Texas, it could be Michigan.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  I've heard it. It's always the same.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  My buddy's friend knows a truck driver who saw a wreck where a truck was dumped over and they had martial law signs.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  But see, then everybody ignores the real stuff where Homeland Security and the Army Times and literally hundreds of government publications
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  have said they're preparing and drilling to lock down cities and to arrest people off of databases.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  And Northcom says they want 400 plus thousand troops on the streets and now Homeland Security admits the main target of Homeland Security is the American people.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  And that's all mainstream news now, and we have internal government documents that are now public, and so there's the meat and potatoes.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  So, I mean, if the government and projects shed would nerve gas and radiate thousands of our troops in hundreds and hundreds of different tests right up until the 90s, they'll do anything.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  And, I mean, if they'll shoot up Iraqi kids and then laugh about it once they find out it was little kids, little girls, they'll do anything.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  And get away with it. And that's not saying the whole military, but the power structure encourages that. That's the direction and the trend they're going.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  But I'll tell you what I know is a fraud is Nasserah. The National Stabilization Act, and oh, the Special Forces are on our side, that's been around for 20 years.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  And there's been new manifestations of that, and oh, the good government's been declared and the states have been told and it's going to happen and everything's fine.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  And, I mean, whether these are government disinfo ops or just delusional fruit cakes that want to believe this, I don't know.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  But I stick to what I can prove. Anything else?
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  No, just what you got to remember, though, that Nazi Germany did bring back the guillotine and use it on a large scale.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  Well, the reason this has such appeal with Christians is the Bible talks about the Antichrist and guillotines, and the Saudi Arabians use guillotines or swords.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  There's some other governments that use them. The French used it, of course, and killed hundreds of thousands with it.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  I think the number is almost 200,000 during the French Revolution.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  Look, I mean, I'm not saying they can't chop our heads off. And we did confirm that they were fitting thousands of vehicles in Bastrop, Texas at a federal prison back in 98.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  And we got photos inside of them, and we went up an airplane over it and took photos.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  And then we confirmed that they had a federal contract to put bolts and chains in those, and then we've never really seen those used against any group.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  And we confirmed in police state to the takeover. We went and talked to the guards there.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  And then after we reported it was even on Fox News locally, but they said it was good that they had bolts and chains in the floors and barbed wire fences inside these old hangers.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  And then at Pier 57 in New York, it was the almost exact same setup and out in Denver for the DNC, they set up one of these.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  And so, yeah, that's going on. Anything else?
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  No, thanks for clearing it up for me, Alex.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  Well, again, it doesn't mean it's not real. It's just there's so much stuff I can prove. I mean, police stayed for the rise of FEMA is everything we can prove.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  And it's so horrible. What we know is off the charts. I mean, it's insane.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  We know the feds are paying counties and cities nationwide for at least a decade to run warrantless checkpoints and now take DNA and federal grants to take blood at checkpoints.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  I mean, it's getting crazy. Let's go ahead and talk to Thomas in Texas. Thomas, you're on the year. Go ahead.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  Mr. Jones, I can't express the high level of excitement I have in finally getting through to you.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  Well, I'm sorry I'm going to let you down, but go ahead.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  No, seriously. I mean, I remember my mother way back when telling me not to listen to you, but of course, you know, she, of course, believed the 9-11 and other things.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  But enough about that. There were two things I wanted to address really quickly.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  First, I wanted to know what your thoughts were on Ayn Rand.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  Now, I do understand that contemporary objectivists believe the 9-11 myth, saying imperial wars of aggression are good and that she herself didn't like libertarians and thought the gun control issue was irrelevant.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  But I remember that she said that the initiation of force by the state was morally reprehensible, but that self-defense was good.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  Like other political philosophers have, such as John Locke. So I wanted to know what you thought of her.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  Well, I mean, she was at her peak 50, 60 years ago, and I read a few of her books and it's interesting perspective about the individual versus the state.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  And I think you can take a lot of good things away from that.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  But I mean, what else can you really say? I'm not really an acolyte or a follower of hers.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  But I mean, I think it's some useful information.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  Obviously, I'm not either. I mean, I can find good things with, you know, libertarians, you know, Ron Paul, and even the list can go on and on.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  But, you know, when she says things like having like a laissez-faire economy and all that, you know, it kind of does, you know, put, you know, fractional reserve lending as well as other regulations.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  Yeah, well let's be clear. This is not a laissez-faire economy that we have. They keep blaming it on that.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  This is a command and control crony pirate system, not even crony capitalist.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  And it is a fraud. This is piracy. We have a looting.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  We have a mega-elite, a very small cloistered group that get away with murder.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  And that's what we have. And then they blame that on capitalism, that on the free market, when this is the opposite.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  I mean, the big banks are always pushing for more government power because they control the government.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  Yeah, no arguing here. Obviously, capitalism is being used with the Patsy.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  But there was actually a little bit of goodness for you in College Station, Texas, where a Texas A&M University is.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  There have been posters going up of both the Bush Joker, the Obama Joker, you know, and the Fed, several of the body scanner.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  Posters you had up on InfoWars.com and other things like that being posted around the campus and around the town there.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  There is another listener of yours also here that's been planning on handing out police day for your latest documentary.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  And I've also been personally on a one-on-one basis, two different professors of mine, different articles.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  Like, I remember there was one you had about the vocabulary, I think it was a British article, let's see, it was about the 800, the vocabulary of people in...
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  Oh, teenagers, that's right, it was teenagers in...
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  Yeah, no, a 16-year-old teenager in the U.S. and England, basically now they have the vocabulary of an 8-year-old.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  And in large part due to text messaging, it was down to 800 words, I think, some of the studies found.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  And I show that to a couple of my, you know, a couple of other folks.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  I showed there's actually an old Army veteran of, I think it was like 15 years in my constitutional law class.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  I showed him the Mayak and these reports, you know, like you broke and especially emphasized, you know, the disgruntled military veteran's part on there.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  And he kind of, he stopped being jovial, he just had this kind of weird turn of attitude.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  He kind of expressed concern for my safety because I got off the Internet.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000]  Hey, good job, and why would he be so cowardly?
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  Oh my gosh, you better not look at that, you'll get in trouble.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  That's right, three sport perky water bottles and free shipping and $87 value yours free, but only for a limited time.

[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.

[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  Let's continue with your phone calls and then IMF's global taxes can only be enforced through global government.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  ADL calls for major law enforcement operation to deal with Obamacare critics.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  And that ties in with IMF fat tax.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  Terrainin banks will increase cost for consumers as a giant scam by the big banks.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  Let's go ahead and who did I talk to last, John?
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  Casey in California, you're on the air.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  Yeah, awesome. How are you doing, Alex?
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  I'm all right, brother.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  You're fine, Douglas. I'm on my work here. I've got a couple of questions.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  What did that thing come out?
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  Well, we've done a lot of research on chemtrails.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  The problem is there's so much evidence, so many government documents, so many symposiums,
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  so much video of the government admitting they're doing it, and then so many rumors that I'm debating whether to put it in part two of Fall of the Republic,
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  which deals with eugenics mainly, or whether to make a separate film on the subject.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  I mean, sometimes I debate whether I should just quit the radio show and only make films,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  because I don't have time to do what I want with films.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  But we need the radio show to overall get the films out,
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  but the films are probably even more effective than talk radio,
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  but now we're getting so many affiliates that the radio may overshadow the films.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  I mean, it's just, it's all military here. Everything's a military operation.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  What military do we work for? The Constitution Bill of Rights, the American people.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  We work for God, but it's kind of like they say in Dragnet, we're on a mission from God.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  But go ahead, sir.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  Okay, another thing too.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  Next contest, if you have one, this is just a throw out banner war,
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  like some type of whoever can do the best banner.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  I mean, we can get these things hung from buildings, from freeways, from whatnot.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  I just think it's a really good idea to wake people up, even maybe have a pick of the day to work.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  You know, hey, look, this info warrior from Nebraska sent this picture, and it's a pick of the day.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  Just something that will help, but at the same time, get people's interest.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  No, I hear you, because then you have the banner hanging at 10s of thousands,
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  see on a major highway, then you put it on YouTube, 10s of thousands see it conservatively,
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  then we put it on the radio, millions hear about it, then that gives them the idea to do it,
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  and then it causes a banner revolution or a poster revolution.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  We've talked about this a lot.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  Why wait for me?
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  I mean, I've promoted, I push it, we did the Joker contest that was on hundreds of TV stations,
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  hundreds of newspapers, was an international sensation, because you've got the power,
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  you set that free, you did it.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  Okay, see, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  I mean, it's all up to you.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  We don't have a big staff.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  We don't have the funds.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  I mean, I'm launching a new website soon, and it's a social networking site that's cutting edges,
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  they'd say, high quality, and I got a good price on it for a well-known company here in Austin to make it,
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  and now that's $30,000.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  The servers to run it, where it doesn't go down and crash, $50,000 to buy them,
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  we're buying the mid-grade, and then, I don't know, $3,000 a month to run it.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  I mean, that's why we're here saying, listen to the sponsor, buy this good, buy the videos, buy the t-shirts,
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  please, fund us, because to have employees to sit there and get the pick of the day,
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  to get the video of the day, to get it posted, I mean, all I've got is Aaron Dykes,
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Kurt Nemo, that are doing web stuff for us,
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  and I'm building a new studio, expanded, I mean, I've got to hire people for that, and it takes money, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  We can't do it all, but yes, it's a good idea.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  Let's talk to Michael in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  Yeah, I like how you doing today.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  I'm doing all right, sir, always enjoyed talking to you, the great listeners.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  Great, great, Texas loves you, and just want to tell you how much we appreciate you.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  I had heard the deal on Janet Rideau this morning, too, on the power hour,
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  and they had some information, which I don't know for sure, I hadn't checked it myself,
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  that they had talked to a guy who had loaded the Hellfire missiles on a Apache helicopter,
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  which had come back with one missile short.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  No, I'm familiar with that report from Fort Hood.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  I know, even the congressional record, stuff that was entered in the record,
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  but wasn't on the televised hearings on C-SPAN, that Delta Force was there pulling triggers,
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000]  that Janet Rideau was under the control of Clinton, and that he was going to fire her,
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  and again, this is from 16, 17 years ago, so I'm going back into memory,
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  but I distinctly remember it being confirmed in the news that Reno threatened Clinton,
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  that she was going to come out with what really happened there,
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000]  and now Dick Morris, there's more to Dick Morris saying Clinton better watch,
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  saying conservatives are going to stage terror attacks or cause them,
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  because the truth about Waco will come out.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000]  Dick Morris better watch it, he better have bodyguards,
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000]  because Dick Morris is not going all the way when he says that, you know,
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  he doesn't know what Janet Reno threatened him with.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  He knows full well that they went in there and murdered those people.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:00.000]  or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  It's true. Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country,
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000]  and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:30.000]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com,
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  The Silver Nano Particles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products,
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:53.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  Bring those bankers that stole all that money to justice.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  The very banks that did that are in the regulatory positions in Europe, England, the U.S. and Canada,
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  and they literally wrote the legislation at the U.N. level and at the national level.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  This is the most important info out there economically.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  And the very same banking group funds the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center and others,
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  calling anyone a violent terrorist or a racist that criticizes the takeover of healthcare, the auto industry,
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  the greenhouse gas taxes, VAT.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  That's coming up after Paul Joseph Watson leaves us.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  This article is up on www.prisonplanet.com today.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:40.000]  ADL calls for major law enforcement operation to deal with Obamacare critics.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  And here in my hand is the actual ADL 20-page report.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  I didn't have time to count it up this morning when Watson first alerted it to me.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  There's a Southern Poverty Law Center hit piece against us at least once a week now.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  ADL every month or so.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  This is a group that's been convicted in California of infiltrating law enforcement,
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  stealing files on people.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  It's basically a Mossad front group.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  And I really don't appreciate Israel attacking me.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  And implying that I'm a terrorist and implying that I'm going to stage terror attacks
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  and implying that I'm calling for violence.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  And we have the Southern Poverty Law Center doing that.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  We have the media doing that.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  We have Newsweek, Time Magazine, The London Guardian saying that I'm causing violence or calling for violence.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  And it's all a lie.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  Now, what they do in this report is they go to a bunch of different websites and message boards
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  and find some mild things, some extreme things, and then attribute it to our rhetoric.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  I can go to Fox Nation.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  I can go to Yahoo message boards.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  I can go to any major message board, YouTube.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  You can go to YouTube right now and search comments calling for violence.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  They're everywhere.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  And this is an ongoing thing they do.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  You know, within two hours of Richard Poplowski killing three cops,
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  it turned out he was a white supremacist who hated me all over major Nazi websites.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  And he posted that he didn't like me on my website.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  But they lied within two hours of him being captured after he killed the cops
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  and said that he did it because of me.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  They even had people on TV saying it.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  And the writer at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette who first put this out
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  writes basically pieces weekly promoting ADL Southern Poverty Law Center propaganda.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  And they have their people in every city.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  So the question is, why are they doing this?
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  But this is a new level by the ADL.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  It calls for, quote, major law enforcement operation against us and others.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  And we had two weeks ago, Fox News and articles they wrote at foxnews.com
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  saying they called Homeland Security on us,
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  that they called Homeland Security on us because of mildly threatening comments
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  on infowars.com and prisonplot.com.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  Then we went to Fox Nation and found things far more violent.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  And we found pundits calling on Fox television for the death of Obama.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  But nothing was done there.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  It's not just the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  It's now Fox News doing this.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  The question is, why are they coming after us?
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  Because we're identifying the banking takeover that is taking place right now.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  Paul Joseph Watson, let's go through your excellent article.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  ADL calls for major law enforcement operation to deal with Obamacare critics.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  A group mixes in completely nonviolent internet postings with death threats
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  in new purge against internet dissent.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  Paul Watson.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  This is a new 20 page report put out recently by the ADL.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  And basically what it is, it mostly consists of just a list of comments
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  that they've called from a handful of websites, infowars.com, the prison planet forum,
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  a couple of militia websites from Michigan and New Hampshire, and foxnews.com as well.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  The majority of it is a list of comments that they say
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  requires the action of a major law enforcement operation against these people.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  You read the actual comments and it's people expressing nonviolent, peaceful dissent
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  against things like Obamacare, amnesty, immigration, the threat to the Second Amendment,
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  and new taxes, basically any criticism of Obama, any criticism of big government,
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  it's completely nonviolent and they say that that requires a national law enforcement operation against it.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  Well Watson, since over a year ago now with the Poplowski murder,
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  I mean we've known that we're the number one enemy,
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  we're who they went after within two hours of him giving himself up and it was all a lie.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  And saying that we're calling for killing IRS employees and saying that we're calling for killing cops,
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  this is meant to be given to cops to go let's get this guy, let's set him up.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  So they're clearly really trying to egg on or mind control police and others to come in
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.000]  and I guess plant pipe bombs on us, God knows what, this is very, very dangerous
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  and now they're just out in the open saying law enforcement operation against us.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  So I don't have the time, the money, the energy that I have had my lawyer in the past put the ADL on notice,
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  I've got to do it again and I don't know this has gotten so dangerous I may just have to sue him just for protection
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  because once I'm behind bars I won't be able to do it, go ahead.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  And don't forget that the infamous Mayak report which listed constitutionalists,
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  non-pol supporters, people who owned guns, people who owned gold, even people who fly US flags,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  listed them alongside terrorists, that was created with the aid of information gleaned
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  and provided by the ADL and the Southern Policy Law Center.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  That's right, this is public, so can we imagine in their secret intelligence reports,
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  which they admit they're giving police what they're telling them?
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  I mean if they're publicly lying and saying we're calling for violence,
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  Heaven knows what's going on secretly.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  And what's amazing is one of the quotes listed is from our own forum moderator
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  whose very job it is to ban people who make violent comments.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  It's completely ironic and on top of that we had a story last year I believe
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  where for four months the Southern Poverty Law Center had on its own website as one of the top comments,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  one of its supporters saying that you, Alex Jones, should be executed for your political beliefs.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  It stayed up there for four months.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  I didn't see the ADL including that little comment.
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  And after we wrote an article, after we wrote an article about it, they then removed it,
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  only after we wrote that article.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  Did you find that article that you wrote or was it Steve and did you link that in this new one?
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  Yeah, it's linked in there.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  And the other point is of course the other comments that they've stopped listing on all these hate group reports
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  are those of Hal Turner because it turned out that his death threats against federal officials
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  were as a result of him being on the FBI payroll.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  So they use a fad to demonize us.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  Exactly.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  And half of these comments calling for violence are probably by these very same people anyway.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  The ones coming from the militia armed assault websites, places like that.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  And then they just mix it in with peaceful nonviolent criticism of healthcare reform
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  and then call for a major national law enforcement operation against people who descend.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  Well, clearly...
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  It's helping to open fascism.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  Clearly this is a new level that should send alarm flags and bells going off everywhere.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  This is a red alert and it's clear.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  I mean, they now admit what was in the Homeland Security Mic reports from over a year ago is the national policy.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  In fact, pull it up for people watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  FBI director says domestic groups as big a threat as al-Qaeda.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  Obama says that we're supposedly working with al-Qaeda with suitcase nukes,
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  that I guess we made in our kitchens or something,
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  and that we're racist.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  Glenn Beck separately saying that 9-11 truthers want to kill Obama with no proof.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  So it is just entering the bizarro world.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  And we saw all this hype before there was any violence.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  And then Joe Stack, very suspicious.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  The Pentagon shooter, very suspicious.
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  All of this very suspicious.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  They clearly want to use Homeland Security in a type of Nazi or slash red purge.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  The Southern Primary Law Center two days ago put out a hit list against myself and others.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  And so they are really getting everybody ready to stage the terror attacks and try to arrest us en masse.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  And which I guess with some people is going to elicit people defending themselves,
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  then that will be a self-fulfilling prophecy of terrorism.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  And it's the case that the ADL and the SPLC have gone from tracking, you know,
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:25.000]  these rag-tag, toothless, skin-head neo-Nazis, which were an extreme minority, but they did exist.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000]  Now the public's awake to the fact that there's no threat to anyone whatsoever.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  So wholesale, they've completely shifted over into demonizing people who mildly criticize Obamacare.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  So what they're doing is just out in the open, and it's only going to discredit them in the long run.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  Well, I agree with you, Watson.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  And if they do set me up and try to arrest me, everybody carry on at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  If they do set me up or kill me or arrest me, they'll then have all the COINTELPRO reveal themselves even more.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  That will be useful on the Patriot websites that our government controlled will attack me at that point.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  Because it's, again, the image of someone who's real, who's had an effect against the New World Order.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  They don't want other people to see what I've done as a model of success.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  So the image of Alex Jones has to be demonized on all fronts and destroyed.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  But, again, that won't even work.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  So I can sleep well and die well if they do kill me, knowing that we have dealt them grievous blows.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  Exactly, but the fascist nature of what they're doing is inherent in the fact that they're publishing hit lists of people like Ron Paul.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  I mean, this is a mild-mannered congressman, and they're basically saying he's a terrorist.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  These people are out of their minds, and of course, another is mine.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  Well, no, no, no, Paul, they're not out of their minds.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  They control Northcom and Homeland Security and 400,000 domestic troops, and they run all the local police departments,
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  and they got the cops eating out of their hand, and they're getting ready to...
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  The globalists are getting ready to blow some stuff up, so it seems crazy until you enter into the equation,
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.000]  the people controlling our federal government are getting ready to stage terror attacks.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  Go ahead.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  Well, yeah, as you say, they're crazy like foxes, but they're desperate, and you can tell.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  I mean, another motivation is the fact that the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  have all these lucrative government tie-ins.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  They need to keep dangling these extremist boogeymen in front of the American people
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  to keep receiving their funding, to keep getting the donation.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  You know, if these people didn't exist, then they'd cease to exist because the funding had stopped,
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  and they're directly tied into the federal fusion centers and the police groups that they feed this information to.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  So now they're calling for peaceful political activists to be targeted by law enforcement
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  for having opinions about high taxes and health care.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  It's gone completely over the line.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  Well, it has, Watson, and it just shows the hot nature for those that don't know what that means.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  This is not a cold war against the American people by the banks.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  This is now going into a hot war, and they're now phrasing the debate
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  so that they can blame us for what they're about to do and then come out physically against us,
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  and they're just everywhere calling for our arrest, calling for shutting down freedom on the Internet
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  because they've decided to go ahead with their complete bankruptcy and takeover and reorganization of the United States.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000]  And it's just too bad the public got so decadent and dumbed down, or they would have never allowed this to happen.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  I mean, if the general public who's starting to wake up had any idea just how serious it is,
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  they would be 100 times more concerned.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  The amazing thing about it is that everybody's talking about a new world order.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  In this report, it says if you talk about fascism or socialism or a new world order,
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000]  then that's a big red flag that you're in with the domestic terrorists.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  You've just released a film, Invisible Empire, that has, what, at least 200 different examples
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  of politicians and leaders and business people and globalists calling for a new world order.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  So if you talk about it in a positive light, then, you know, you're part of the mindset of the elite and that's good.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  But don't you dare criticize it because you're a domestic terrorist and it doesn't exist anyway.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  Well, they're throwing the gauntlet down to the yuppies and well-to-do people and intellectuals,
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  and they're saying, look, we're taking this country completely over.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  It's going to be a hot police state and we're going to start arresting people and we're going to have purges.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  And if you criticize world government or say you don't want banks taking over, we may arrest you.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  And we've built FEMA camps and we're going to do it.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  And, you know, I hadn't talked about this yet.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  You know, he didn't really ask me not to talk about it, but I wanted to see when unfolded first.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  But Jeff Goldberg, who's one of the main people that put it, I mean, even in mainstream news,
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  he's credited with writing the reports for major national publications.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  He writes for Atlantic Monthly right now for writing the major articles about WMDs being real.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  He was an Israeli prison commander and he's an Israeli army officer.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  And he was here and it was like an ADL assessment.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  He came to say he's interviewing me for Atlantic Monthly and it was literally an assessment.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  And I said, no, I'm not violent, but I don't like what you guys are doing.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000]  And I said, you know, this is my country and I don't want to be a slave.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  And I said, you know, what the globalists are doing is wrong.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  And he's got all these ADL awards and he acted real friendly till right at the end of the interview.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  And I've seen this with media a lot. And at the end, he got very cold with me, you know, when he left.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  But I mean, you know, I mean, they're flying. I mean, he's a top level, you know, neocon, flying them down here to sit there
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  and I guess decide what they're going to do to me.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  And, you know, the FBI run white supremacist groups are calling for my death.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  I mean, I've got Israel attacking me. I got the white supremacist attacking me.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  All because I don't want to be a slave of my family to be slaves.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  So Watson, this is a very, very dangerous time when I've got Israeli army officers, you know, here at my office.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  I mean, it's getting creepy, Watson.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  And I agreed to meet with him because, you know, it's like a foreign government coming to talk to me.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  And I just said, look, I mean, you know, what you're doing is wrong.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  What the government's doing is wrong. And I'm a good person.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  And he was like, well, I realize that and understand that.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  You know, but it's just, but still, it's like he's a foreign army and I'm the evil American and that's the end of it.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  You know, it's kind of like two soldiers across the line smoking cigarettes talking to each other.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  And what do you say to that, Watson?
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's exactly what it is. They're trying to silence their political opposition.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  They don't care about violent extremist threat.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  If anything violent did happen, then they'd be the ones to benefit from it.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  So, you know, where the opposition, where the enemy, they have to shut down our free speech to get their agenda ran through.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  And that's why they're characterizing everybody as extremist and terrorist because it's designed to chill free speech.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  And this is an act of terrorism itself, saying Ron Paul and Napolitano are basically terrorists.
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  They say they're terrorists. I mean, this is their terrorist. Come on. Thank you, Watson.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  What did Crystal do?
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using heart and body extract.

[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  If it's Berkey water purification systems, this message is for you.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride at less than 2 cents per gallon?

[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  Remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.

[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  This isn't a joke. It's not a game. It's not a drill. It's real.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  You know, we got CNN calling here, day after day nightline asking why I won't call them back.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  I've pretty much decided just not even to do it. They want to come down here and then interview me and then do whatever they want with it.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  And the reason they're doing this is they're putting me out there as the enemy. They're lying about who I am.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  And we're in very dangerous water here because we're having an effect.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  And the globalists, again, they'll kill a million Iraqis because they want oil and weapons sales.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  And Americans mean nothing to them. My only protection is that I am vocal. I am out in the open. But I do need your prayers.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.000]  I mean, I do need your prayers. I mean, I got the ADL calling for law enforcement operations against me.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  I'm an American who has free speech and I'm here on the radio and on my own Internet TV telling the truth, reading government documents on air,
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  and asking the American people, is this what you want? This is our country.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  I have an inherent right to my free speech and to talk to my fellow citizens. And all that matters is freedom.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  I understand how short life is. It seems like 10 minutes ago I was 5 years old. It seems like 30 seconds ago I had my first child almost 8 years ago.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  And I'm a lover of life and of goodness and of the truth.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  And I'm committed to my cause and I'm not stopping. And the system needs to know that.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  No amount of intimidation, no amounts of demonization, no amount of threats, nothing, not even threats on my family.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  I'm committed. And they know that. And they don't like that.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  Because they're afraid of the spirit of commitment that I have and that others have that we bring on this radio show that we magnify.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  If that spirit becomes infectious in their view, it's over. It's over for the New World Order.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  And to all of you that see yourselves as liberals, as conservatives, as establishment, as government.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  Look, your hall having your way of life destroyed, you're having your future destroyed.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  And really evil, ruthless, corrupt elites have decided to go for broke worldwide.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  And I'm going to stand up against this to the end.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  It only makes me stronger to know I've been right all along.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  But I always knew I was right. I was reading their own documents. I studied history.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  And it only makes me commit more and makes me grow up and be that much more serious.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  But they are Fox News, ADL, all of them calling for police to come arrest me for no reason.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  I've done nothing but tell the truth as a citizen, I have that right.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  I've defended habeas corpus. I've defended due process.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  I've defended the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  I've defended the Second Amendment. I've defended the First Amendment.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  I've defended Internet freedom. I have defended our national sovereignty
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  against the corporate banking takeover that's now publicly happening.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  And we're effective and we have reached out to millions of people and they can see our growth curve.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  They can see the exponential drive. They can see the exponential effect that we're having.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  And they've identified us as one of the central engines, myself and Ron Paul.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  Also, Napolitano is being listed as a terrorist now.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  Let's get Napolitano on about this next week.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  But I do believe and I do know, and I have faith in the power of prayer and providence.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  And just as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and others made an appeal to heaven,
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  and we should make a t-shirt that said, don't try it on me, there's that appeal to heaven flag.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000]  What was that? The Connecticut flag? Pull up the appeal to heaven flag.
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  I forget what colony had that. And so I was thinking about a month ago,
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  that should be the symbol of infall wars.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  There's an appeal to heaven flag. I appeal to heaven.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  God, I'm not perfect, but you know, I have a true heart and I love the truth and I love justice.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:07.000]  And I, you know, I have courage and you know, I'm ready for whatever's coming.
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  But I appeal to heaven that your will be done and whatever happens to me, please protect my family.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  But you know, I'm not going to stop.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  This is an appeal to heaven. And I ask my listeners for this appeal to heaven.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  If we appeal to heaven together and then take right action against evil, God's will will be done, whatever that is.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  And then it's just such a comfort when I commit to this and put it on the altar of God and dedicate myself to the truth.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  And I ask God to purify me and sanctify me and help me be good for this great mission that you have given me.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000]  Thank you, God. Amen.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  It inclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:21.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  At least state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:35.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:14.000]  Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:23.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  They had exhausted all forms of peaceful, worldly resistance in appealing to the king and the corrupt regional governors.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.000]  It was the Massachusetts colony that had the appeal to heaven flag.
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  It was also adopted by the Navy after the war started in John Paul Jones.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  And so I have made my appeal to heaven. I ran out of time in the last hour to get into IMF.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  Global taxes can only be enforced through global government.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  Bankers repair to assault Americans with VAT transaction taxes. Love and Guardian with a new financial VAT tax.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  I will cover this in the last hour today.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  Another chilling article that dovetails with the report by Paul Joseph Watson,
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:26.000]  where the ADL is calling for law enforcement action against myself, Ron Paul, and others in a report.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  Southern Poverty Law Center actually did that in one of their reports, the ADL for myself and others.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  We have the full report up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  And we have a video coming up in the last hour.
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  DHS boss says Tea Party will engage in violence. This is an article up at infowars.com that Curt Nemo has done.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  I think it's key for him to add a link at the top, though, to Watson's articles.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  You can put both these together also with what the ADL is doing.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  ADL calls for major law enforcement operations to deal with Obamacare critics.
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  I talked about this two weeks ago when it first was in testimony in Congress.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  And then I kept getting emails saying, why haven't I covered it?
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  So I covered it three or four more times, and I got more emails saying, why haven't I covered it?
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  So we've got Bill Murphy we've had on years ago back on the show coming up in the next segment.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  But because so much is happening, he was going to be on for a full hour, probably on about 40 minutes,
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  because I need to, after he's on with us, have time to get into all this other news here.
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  And the Dick Morris saying Bill Clinton personally orchestrated the 93 Waco tragedy
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  and ties it into the government staging terror, basically.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  This is big news on that front coming up.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:47.000]  But we'll be talking to Bill Murphy after the break with the Gold Antitrust Action Committee.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  We'll be discussing that with him.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  He's the chairman and director of the GATA, and that is coming up with really important news
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  with whistleblowers and others coming out proving that Goldman Sachs connected JPMorgan and others
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  suppressing gold and silver prices, a giant price fixing, keeping the price down
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  so it won't compete with their derivatives and their other fraudulent instruments.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  So that is coming up in the next segment.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  But I don't know, I have the ADL openly called for law enforcement to come after us
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  and to make up stuff and create strawman arguments against us.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  Just now the Southern Poverty Law Center doing it, because these are serious soldiers.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  I mean, the ADL serious soldiers, so is the Southern Poverty Law Center running Elohim City
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  and government documents been released and tied into McVeigh and what happened there.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  I mean, they don't play games.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  That's what we've been trying to explain to people.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  I mean, this is a military force, we're fighting.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  And they have the mainstream media always wrapping them in patriotism and all this.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  They're the opposite of patriotism, the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  And this pretty much 100% confirms they're going to physically come after us
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  or through law enforcement.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  And when this burden comes upon me, this realization of how right we've been,
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  it's a burden of responsibility that I better make every radio show in the time I've got allotted,
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  whether it's a day or 100 years, I better make it count.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  I better be on.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  I better be focused.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  I better use every minute I've got.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  But to do that, I've got to rest.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  To do that, I've got to get right with God completely.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.000]  God's been calling me to take time off to go away, to stay in a cabin for a month,
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  to really have time to be still so that the deeper understanding
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  and the true message I have for people to be put out there.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  We'll be back on the other side of this quick break.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.000]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans.
[02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:08.000]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it. Others don't.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  See consumer reviews. Then select the best realtor for you.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  Go to homegain.com and get an instant home value estimate.

[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  that helps you determine which home improvements to make to increase your home's value.

[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  Look for Max, the orange homegain gorilla to help you find a realtor
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  or with any other real estate needs you might have at homegain.com.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  You're a real estate connection.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:55.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:08.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  Well, he testified it was on C-SPAN before the CFTC.
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  He had about five minutes so he read the information very, very quickly
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  so we get into the record.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  And he's Bill Murphy, chairman and director of GATA Gold Antitrust Action Committee.
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:30.000]  We've had him on over the years several times and other members have got him.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:37.000]  And so there have been some huge new developments that have even ended up in a few mainstream newspapers
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  in the last two weeks.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  Whistleblowers in the U.S. and England and others coming out with JPMorgan Chase
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000]  and others fixing gold and silver market.
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000]  Now we've known this has gone on for a while but now we're getting specifics.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  And they've been harassed.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000]  They've had a lot of problems since they've been exposing this.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  We'll talk about that.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:09:01.000]  But this is a big deal because we've got the manipulation and the fact that Goldman Sachs and others
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  were telling people to invest in derivatives while they were planning to implode them by design.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  They've now been indicted for that.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  You've got more and more coming out.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  But one of the biggest scams is the suppression of the gold and silver market
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  for a reverse carry trade that they've been using there.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  And so even if you don't like silver and gold or aren't into real assets,
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  this deals with the overall fraud and is really a central issue.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  And so he'll be with us for about the next 40 minutes or so and he won't have to hurry through his information.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  So Mr. Murphy, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  You've got the floor.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  Great to be here, Alex.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  One thing that I know that some of your listeners may not care about gold and silver,
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000]  but they certainly care about the economy and the financial markets.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  And January 31st, 2008, got a place of $264,000 full-page color ad in the Wall Street Journal,
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  which was a couple of months before everything fell apart.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  In that ad, we talked about catastrophe and disaster coming
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  directly from the suppression of the price of gold.
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  It has to do with the relationship between gold and interest rates.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  And had they led the price of gold trade freely, it would have been much, much higher.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  It would have been more a warning sign.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  The thermometer would have been off.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  There wouldn't have been maybe such risk taking.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  But interest rates wouldn't have been so low as they were for so long.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  And so it directly affected every one of your listeners
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  because they've artificially kept the price of gold way below where it should be.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  If it's gold that kept pace with inflation, it would be $2,300 an ounce.
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  Even trading with platinum, another precious metal used to trade
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  before the suppression scheme about the same price.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  Platinum, I think, is $1,730 today, and gold is something like $1,140.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  Absolutely.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  The suppression of gold and silver is key to their entire derivatives fraud
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  and allowed them to do what they've done now.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  They're now calling for world government, financial taxes,
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  the EAT on all banks and institutions, pay to the elite banks.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  They're involved in an all or nothing takeover right now.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  And this information could bring them down.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  You're starting to get some major traction.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  Break down how it works and the latest information.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  Well, the Gold Antitrust Action Committee was formed in January 1999
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  by my colleague Chris Powell and myself.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  Chris is the editor of a daily newspaper.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  And to expose the manipulation of the gold price by a bunch of billion banks
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  And then we realized that the government was involved
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  and also the Fed and the Treasury.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.000]  And we've been on this 11 years and we finally got a little daylight.
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  Somehow I got a CNBC 11 years ago, Ron and Sana.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.000]  And that was the last time the American public heard from me in the mainstream.
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  We've been banned ever since.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  And we got a break with this commodity futures trading commission
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  where there's a great commissioner there named Bart Shilton.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000]  And he's really trying to do the right thing.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  And he got me on the docket to make a presentation in front of the CFTC.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  And that was on television.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  Of course, the only thing that the TV feed that went down was when I was speaking.
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  And as soon as I was done, the feed gets back on.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000]  It's very interesting because what most people don't know,
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  Chairman Getzer, when it started said,
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  we're not going to get into specific allegations.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000]  We don't want to go there.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  And Bart Shilton got livid.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  He went red in his face.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000]  He said, are we going to have censorship?
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000]  And Chairman Getzer back down and then the TV feed went off.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.000]  But in that presentation, I talked about how the concentration of positions
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  by J.P. Morgan Chase and HSBC and other big bank are ridiculous.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  And they were way more than any other commodity market
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  in terms of this concentration issue.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  And we then went on to explain what the manipulation was all about and so on.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  So it was quite a show because it was a whistleblower who showed up
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  and they wouldn't let him speak.
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  He thought he was going to him.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000]  Well, let's stop right there, Mr. Murphy,
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  because I want to go over that and take your time on this.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  But it seemed a backfire that they cut the TV feed when you were testifying
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  because it was recorded.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  It did end up getting out on the web.
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  And so, I mean, that really highlighted what you were saying for people.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  And then that they wouldn't let the whistleblower speak.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  I mean, there's a serious cover up here. Go ahead.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:29.000]  Yeah. Well, there is.
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  And what happened was this whistleblower, Andrew McGuire,
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  got hold of one of our directors, Adrian Douglas,
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000]  and we wrote up what Andrew McGuire had to say.
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.000]  And basically, he told the CFTC by emails three or four or five months in advance
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  what J.P. Morgan was going to do ahead of time.
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  He says, here's what they're going to do and when.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.000]  And it happened. And we had these emails and I read out J.P. Morgan
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.000]  that their traders were laughing at the public and ripping them off.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000]  They're making all this money. The public is a bunch of dopes
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  because they get suckered all the time by these people that are acting
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  in a collusive action.
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  And so, the email showed up, you know, wouldn't see at the CFTC.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  And afterwards, I was able to present the press with these emails and so on.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  And then the next day, Andrew McGuire and his wife were hit by a car
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  outside of London. It was a wild story where he was hit
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  and then the guy tried to get away and hit two more cars
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  and there was a helicopter chase and you can't get much wilder than this.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  Did they catch the guy?
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.000]  Yeah. But we haven't heard anything about it since. Dead silence.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  But they caught him. Well, I don't know what's happened.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  This is amazing. Again, this is really at the foundation.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  It's like one of the bottom cards in a giant tower of cards
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:51.000]  that are about to topple their manipulation of precious metals.
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  So please continue.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  Well, you know, we're one of our major issues, especially if we're concerned about,
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  you know, what gold and silver is really where the,
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.000]  one of the people who's actually a critic of ours.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  So we were conservative that basically there's the amount of gold and silver trade
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:11.000]  in a day is 100 to 1 compared to what they actually have there in London
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  in their vaults in gold and silver.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  There's a, we believe at some point, just like what happened was made off
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  on some of these other scandals,
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  should a lot of people all want to go get their gold and silver at the same time,
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  you could end up having a default.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  And it's going to get quite wild, I believe, in the months ahead.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.000]  And the major thing is that we've now, because of the CFTC appearance,
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  according to the mainstream, it seems bizarre to me,
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000]  but I guess that gives us credibility.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  So now there's a great deal more interest in what we have to say
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  is spreading all over the world.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  Now, in layman's terms, explain to people why the system wants to suppress gold and silver
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  and how they do it.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  Well, they do it two ways.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000]  One with physical gold, which they have to put in the marketplace,
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  they take gold surreptitiously from central banks and feed it into the system,
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  and then they use it under with derivatives on the, on the Comix
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  and other financial markets into when they play with it with the price in the paper market.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  And one, the banks make money by flushing the specs out over the past,
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000]  even though we've been in a 10-year bull market, they do it all the time,
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  to pick up $30, $40, $50 at a pop.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000]  And for the US government, think about it.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.000]  What happens every time the price of gold goes nuts?
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000]  People say what?
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  It's too much inflation?
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  Crisis? Bad for the dollar?
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000]  It's bad for Wall Street?
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  It's bad for the politician?
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  It's bad for business?
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000]  A rising gold price, whether right or wrong, suggests that something's wrong,
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  at least that's what the...
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:47.000]  Because it reveals the worthless fiat nature of the hyperinflated derivative scam.
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  That's correct.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.000]  And I know that's also what it does.
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000]  In other words, with printing all this money and so on,
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000]  if the gold price were to rally $100 tomorrow,
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.000]  everyone would be jumping up and down about just what you're talking about.
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000]  But because they keep knocking it down, this very little conversation,
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000]  it's kind of just subdued.
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  Continue.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000]  So I think it's going to get very exciting when...
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  It's ironic that GATA is very well known in Russia,
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  but hardly known at all in the United States,
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  because we have no free press here.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:21.000]  And we had a conference in August of 2005,
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  which one of President Putin's top economic advisors, Andre Baikov, came.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000]  The price of gold was $436, and it wasn't going anywhere.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000]  So that was the best conference he was ever at.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.000]  And two days later, the gold price exploded and rallied $300 in the next nine months.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  And at that conference, I said, and was my opinion that, as it was $436,
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000]  then the price of gold is going to go to $3,000 to $5,000 an hour.
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  So that's what will be needed to clear the market.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.000]  So we have a long way to go for any of your listeners that are interested
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:54.000]  in what I believe is a great investment,
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  even though we've been up 10 years in a row now.
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  And clearly, though, they're losing control because it's gone from $300 to $1,145,
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  where we stand today.
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  So if you look at the graph, they're able to push the beach ball underwater,
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  but then over time, it continues to only go up.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  They can't hold it down.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.000]  Well, it's a good point.
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  And what we call it is it's a managed retreat.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.000]  What they do is they never allow too much excitement to ever enter the market.
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  For example, seven times this year, gold has gone up exactly 2%.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  It's a book called a 2% rule.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000]  They don't allow it to go up more than that.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  They work over the shares.
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000]  For example, one of the big funds years ago,
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:41.000]  Oppenheimer lent the shares to JP Morgan, one of the kings of the gold cartel
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000]  to work over the share market.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  So they never allow too much excitement to enter the picture.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000]  So gradually, it's like a stealth bull market.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:54.000]  Some of it was an article the other day that said 93% of investors believe
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  gold's going to go down from here.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  If that isn't bullish, I don't know what is.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.000]  Absolutely.
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.000]  So 93% believe that it's going to go up?
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000]  No, 93% think it's going to go down.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:10.000]  In other words, the public is either neutral to bear it.
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  And by the way, God has been right for the past 10 years about what the price of gold was going to do.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  But if you go look at the records of the Wall Street firms,
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  they've been neutral to bearish almost every one of them all the way up.
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.000]  I can't imagine any other sector or market where Wall Street could be so long.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000]  And they're still that way today.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  Again, to put that in layman's terms, it means that there's nobody bullish.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  And when markets pop out, it's when everyone's bullish and there's too much excitement and enthusiasm.
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  There's almost no enthusiasm about gold now.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000]  Exactly.
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  But the point is they're always saying, because they're paid to and they're always wrong,
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  that it's going to go down and it's a bad investment.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  That's right.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000]  But the people are ignoring them and they're losing all credibility.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  Stay there.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:24.000]  Let's talk about this whistleblower story when we get back.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000]  Throw away all of the other ineffective and expensive advertising methods.

[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:24.000]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:35.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:19.000]  I went down, down, down and the flames went higher.
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  Bill Murphy, the head of Gata, reveals whistleblower in gold price suppression is the YouTube video.
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  They cut the TV feed when he testified and they wouldn't let Andrew Maguire,
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  the independent metals trader, turn whistleblower at the center of a storm
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  for exposing what is the largest fraud in history.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  Max Kaiser, a year before they took down Iceland, was in the capital in the fanciest hotel in the bar.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  And there were Goldman Sachs people bragging about what they were planning to do there.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  And so he went out on TV about it and of course then later it happened.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  But let's talk about this whistleblower himself.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  You can confirm your own research, you can confirm.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  But now you've gotten the emails.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  And I remember for 10 years different whistleblowers went to the different federal regulatory agencies
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  with dossiers showing exactly how Madoff was stealing 50 to 100,
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000]  depending how you look at it, billion dollars.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000]  And they would never do anything about that.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  So please continue.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  Yeah, well we compare ourselves to Harry Marcoblis who went to the FCC for 10 years
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  and said, look at this, it's a fraud.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  I met with the Speaker of the House, Dennis Haster, the Senate Banking Committee,
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  the Joint Economic Committee.
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  We went to President Bush's good friends here in Texas, boyhood friends.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  They've got a fax back from Lawrence Lindsay, his economic advisor.
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  So we're really going after this thing.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  And we really got a break here with this Andrew McGuire because ironically he's a former Goldman Sachs trader.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  And it's another bar story.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  What happened was he was out with these JP Morgan guys.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  He's known them for years.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  And they were laughing at him and they probably had a little too much to drink.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  They were saying what they were doing in the gold market.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  And so he got mad.
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  And he said, you know, this is just wrong.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  And so that's when, you know, we got his information.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  He's been a member of my website, LaMetropoleCafe.com, for three or four years.
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000]  I met him in London.
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  He's a stand-up guy.
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000]  He's a smart guy.
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  He deals with agent banks.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  And in the bullion market, and he just came forth and just dropped his bombshell on the CFTC.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  So they're going to have a tough time letting this one go because what do you explain to the public,
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  especially if these Mark Gold and Silver markets blow up like we think is going to occur?
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  Now, let's be specific.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  And I've talked to a lot of high-power people from Wall Street that also live here in Austin part of the year.
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  And we've discussed this case.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  And they say, absolutely, when you go to these elite bars and you're an elite trader with one of the big firms
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  and you're in a different division, they are so arrogant and brazen.
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  All they talk about is how we're scum, fools, how they're going to take over everything.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000]  That's right.
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  And they just constantly laugh and joke.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  And so because they know the government is run by their alumni, I mean, look at Goldman Sachs.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  They've got every major regulatory position filled.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  Well, I have the treasure of Goldman.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  I still call it government Sachs because half the people at the same at the Treasury come from Goldman Sachs,
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  just like J.P. Morgan at the Fed's Bank.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  But that's the issue.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  People ought to start going into these bars, these elite bars, which is better wear a $2,000 suit
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  and start just recording these guys.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  But again, he sent them emails.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  Andrew sent emails to the CFTC, to their legal counsel saying, here's what's going to happen and when.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  And he said, watching it, at certain days, they seem to attack around job reports,
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  certain government auctions and option expires and so on.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  And he said, this is exactly what they're going to do.
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  And the last time I think one point he mentioned it, I think the price went down like 30 or 40 bucks.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000]  For ours, that's a lot.
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  So these things, this is just a bombshell that's slowly working its way around and festering.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  And finally, it's given us the attention that we've earned after working on this stuff for over a decade.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  And by the way, we're not just idle and just talk about it.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  We're suing the Fed.
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  It was very difficult today for me to listen to President Obama talk about transparency,
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  derivatives, financial market reform, when he's allowing what's occurring in the gold and silver markets.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  So what we did, President Obama wants more transparency.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  He went to the Freedom of Information Act and God asked them to tell us what the U.S. was doing in the gold swap area,
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  just a gold transaction kind of thing.
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  And they said, got back to us and said, no, they're exempt from telling us that they're secrets.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000]  And so we're suing them in federal court to try to get to the truth.
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  It's the American people's gold, not theirs.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:07.000]  Well, I mean, come on, Obama passed the stimulus package that gave banks more power
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  and it retroactively let all the banks keep all their bonuses and run all their scams.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  And it's not just me saying this.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:18.000]  I mean, I'm reading what the Texas Banking Association's saying and their analysis is identical to mine,
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  that this new regulatory framework at the G20 and the national level gives the select banks,
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and a handful of others, the power to take over all the healthy regional banks that aren't in derivatives
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  and sets up a value added tax on all financial transactions that's paid to the coffers of the IMF and World Bank
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  and then fenced directly in to the private central banks.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  I mean, this is so incredible and it's being billed as getting the rich bankers.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000]  Stay there.
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:30:01.000]  Manipulate gold on the other side and how we stop them.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  And here's the best part.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:38.000]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:49.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.

[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:00.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:03.000]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:08.000]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:13.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:26.000]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:31.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries

[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000]  Now what am I going to do?

[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000]  Thanks, Max.
[02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:24.000]  Well, they have my original remote and an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.

[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:26.000]  Bill Murphy, the chairman and director of GATA, Gold Antitrust Action Committee, is our guest.
[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:29.000]  Let's get back into more of what the whistleblowers said.
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:34.000]  How we know the big banks and governments fix the price of gold and silver,
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:39.000]  the way they make profits out of this, how this is detrimental to the public,
[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  and how we support GATA and what you're doing.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  Clearly, there's a fuse going to this keg of TNT that can blow this Ponzi scheme, this fraud sky-high,
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  and really reveal all these crimes that have been committed.
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  This is clearly illegal.
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  We want to make sure that fuse that's now burning burns faster, hotter,
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  and sometimes you light a firecracker and it doesn't burn all the way.
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  It stops, it sputters.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  So, how do we ensure this is a touchdown for the good guys?
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  Well, it shows like this are a big help, Alex, and we're trying to be as visible as possible,
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  because once people look at it and really study the evidence, they go, good grief.
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  And if I might say, on some of the subjects you were talking about, it's not just gold.
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  There's a lot of people that can talk about the Plunge Protection Team,
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  which is the working group in financial markets,
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  which President and Treasurer, head of the SEC and head of the CFTC,
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  work to stabilize the markets.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  And there's something I've never heard one other person mention called the Counter Party Risk Management Group.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  And if any of your people are interested, they can do a Google Counter Party Risk Management Group,
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  and you'll see it's a group of the hedge funds and some of the big Wall Street firms,
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  and you'll see their main mantra, it's head up by a lot of the golden sex people, is to create, quote, stability in the market.
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.000]  And they're behind the scenes working on the stock market.
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  That's one reason we believe you've had this steady upgo, you know, jeez, for it seems like forever.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  It just never seems to correct and just goes up a little bit every day and so on.
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  So, it's pervasive in our markets in addition to gold and silver, which, by the way, they're just, they're tiny little markets for these people.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  And even if they lost money on this, it's like, it would be like a lost leader for the government.
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  If you think of the trillions now, when we talk in those numbers these days, what the government's doing,
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  the little gold market is just this little barometer that they want to have diffuse,
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:44.000]  and that's why they work it over in the physical market and the derivatives and tack it certain times and flush out the speculators,
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:47.000]  get people to moralize it, and then it goes right back up again.
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  Like you said earlier, like a beach ball, it's emerged, it can't keep it down.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  And we'll be, we have a long way to go here and we're working very hard at it.
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:02.000]  I talk about the gold market every day at LaMetropoleCafe.com and people can sign up for a two-week free trial,
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  and if they like it, it's a subscription.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  But the GATA site, they do it at www.gata.org.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:12.000]  It's a free site, Chris Powell puts out emails all the time.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  He just does a fantastic job at alerting people what's going on so they can keep abreast of the situation.
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  And, you know, we know, maybe we're going to get a break with the district court in our lawsuit against it to try to get information from the Fed.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:31.000]  I know the Fed's petrified of the gold issue, which is why they, you know, they're fighting Ron Paul and his bill to honor the Fed.
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000]  Yeah, because this isn't just a little bitty market.
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  I mean, in the aggregate it is, but it could become the biggest market and it would unseat all of their fraudulent paper.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000]  And now we've got Bloomberg and others reporting.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  Federal regulators are going in telling public and private pension funds, threatening them to invest people's savings in, quote, failed banks.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:37:02.000]  And so this is all coming to a head right now, and this is so important to expose this situation.
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:10.000]  I didn't mean, by the way, to diminish the gold and silver issue on the side of it, just in terms of, like, if you talk about market caps or anything like this,
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  it's a tiny market, but it's actually the most important market for just what you're talking about.
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  When that goes, it would be headlines all over the world because gold and silver are not just American markets, they're world markets.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  And it's going to be a major, major story.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:34.000]  And it unseeds all of the major global currencies that are being debased in a concerted effort on record by the G20 so that people don't recognize.
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  It's kind of like in the U.S., you know, they've got a debased currency in Mexico because it's 3 to 1, 4 to 1.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:46.000]  But instead now, with the Euro and all the other major currencies, they're devaluing them basically simultaneously.
[02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  Yes, that's right, right to the point.
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:57.000]  Matter of fact, I mentioned Russia earlier, like the NBC of Russia, Studio One came here about two weeks ago with a camera person and a reporter.
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  They're doing a big story on this.
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  And as I said, it's so ironic that God is very well known in Russia and not known at all in the United States.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:12.000]  Well, Russia, if you actually, Anthony Sutton and others got the U.S. government documents on this, and of course he worked for the Senate,
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.000]  that the large central banks here and in England funded the communists.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:27.000]  And when the Russians in the late 90s kicked out the oligarchs, it turned out they were all fronts for Western brokerage houses and banks.
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  And Russia's got its own problems.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  But Russia is now, in many cases, more free market than we are. They pay people to have children, though, our government wants a one-child policy.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  They've arrested the oligarchs.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  They're talking about world government.
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000]  They're talking about the New World Order.
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  And they're covering all these subjects because for the first time in close to 100 years, there appears to be a real fissure between Russia and the Anglo-American Banking Establishment.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  Well, I know that the Bank of England has been very responsible for the gold price suppression scheme.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  And right now it's a big deal, the gold subject, because Gordon Brown's running for re-election.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.000]  And he sold half their gold right at the bottom of the market.
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:15.000]  And I've had this all laid out with his connection with Goldman Sachs.
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:18.000]  The billion banks were in trouble back then. They needed supply.
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  So he sold England's gold at the bottom.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  It's costing billions and billions of dollars.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  And we're trying to make some hay with this one before the election over there in England.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.000]  Absolutely. That's the type of thing they do.
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  And of course, you go back to 1933 when they made physical holding of gold illegal.
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  And then they jacked with the price a few years ago. They doubled it after all our gold had basically been shipped to Europe.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  So they run these scams, other points that are important for people to be made aware of, looking into your crystal ball and talking to people in the markets.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  I don't want you to make a prediction, but if you had the dead reckoned, how do you see this unfolding?
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  Probably like every other scandal, whether it's a Revco, a brokerage house, or Enron, or Madoff, it blows up.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  And then all of a sudden everyone's running around saying, how could this have happened?
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  And everybody, you know, people delve into the facts of the story, and that's how it's exposed, unfortunately.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  And it's likely going to be the way it's going to happen here, where silver and gold just absolutely explodes.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  There's some defaults in the marketplace. People can't deliver on their promises to deliver the physical bullying of people.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  And it'll be a huge, huge commotion. That's how I think it's going to play out.
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  What's the time frame next two, three years?
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.000]  Yeah, you know, Jesus, so tough about the time frame.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  I mean, it could happen in two weeks or two years.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  It's just one of these things. Had we not had the financial scandal, Madoff would still be trucking right along.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  And a lot of this is up to the listeners of this show. We have several million listeners.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  If they get the censored video of you and others out to people, if they get the censored documents out, if they put pressure,
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  I mean, that's why Obama politically now is going after, with the SEC, Goldman, with, you know, a $5 million fine slap on the wrist,
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  an investigation, maybe some underling will go on probation. They're having to at least do that because it's political suicide.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  If they don't, we need to force this out all the way into the open because even though this is a whitewash investigation,
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:29.000]  it's now opening up more lawsuits. It's now legitimizing those of us that have exposed the corruption of the main pilots of this banking cartel, Goldman Sachs.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:38.000]  That's right. The irony is, is that it's right now, the two Hotchills are HSBC and JP Morgan Chase, where Goldman Sachs was the ringleader in this thing
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  for, I don't know, six, seven, eight, nine years. They've disappeared of late, maybe because they're concentrating on the stock market.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  I don't know, but everywhere we looked for a period of eight or nine years, Goldman Sachs was everywhere on this particular issue.
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  Yeah, they're now top of the heat, top of the heat their underlings are now carrying on this operation.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  But, but again, I think the most important point you made is 90 plus percent, I think you give the number of 93 percent.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  I'm looking at news today. Gold weaker as Greece debt issue back on front burner.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:16.000]  Well, that's the same reason. This is the commentary. It's ludicrous in this industry.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  Lastly, it goes up because of the Greek problems. Then it's down. If these people hit the market, then the reporters just talk about anything.
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  You can have a gold, white, gold could be up to 50 bucks on the Greek debt problems.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  Well, that's what I was about to say. Just as a layman here, but I've done a lot of research, having major currency crises that even in the words of Merkel and the words of Soros could bring down the euro.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  This could bring down the euro. And by every barometer, that should shoot gold straight up.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  And there's all these headlines about gold down $5 or four and a half dollars.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  Let me give you the exact number, folks. Gold's down $4.70 right now.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:04.000]  And the media is saying because currencies are in trouble.
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  This is ludicrous. This is what happens over the years. And we've seen this.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:23.000]  Any followers, I know there's a bunch of people listening on your show. The worse the situation, or the better it is for gold, or the more reasons for people to go to gold, that's when the gold cartel attacks the price because they want to diffuse the barometer, tone down the thermometer.
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  They do it all the time. It's just, again, it's ridiculous for people to say gold's going down because of the crisis. It's just nuts.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  No, it is nuts. But again, they know people are looking at a month-to-month or week-to-week graph.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  You look at the year graph, you look at the two-year, the three-year, the four-year, the five. Gold's going straight up.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  And if it continues like this, what another 10 years, we'll be looking at $2,000.
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:53.000]  We'll be looking at $2,000 probably in another year. Not 10 years.
[02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:02.000]  Well, absolutely. But even in a suppressed market, even if they continued this scam, in 10 years it would double again.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  That's a great investment.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  What's happening is they're running out of available central bank gold.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:13.000]  People think the gold industry says there's 30,000 tons of gold in central bank vaults.
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  Well, according to the work of our guys, which are pretty top-shelf guys, there's less than 15,000 tons.
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:22.000]  European central banks were selling 400 to 500 tons of gold a year.
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  The past three or four months, they haven't sold an ounce. It's drying up.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  It's think of an army that's running out of ammunition.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  The bad guys are running out of ammunition. All they can do is have a rear-guard action.
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:38.000]  But it's painful on these depths. We should be at 2,300. Not where we are here.
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:44.000]  Well, I just did the math, and I was wrong. I was just throwing a basic number out there.
[02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  If gold is up almost four-fold in the last 10 years, then it's exponential.
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:45:00.000]  If it was doubling basically every three, four years, then you're right. Another year and a half or so, it should be well above 2,000.
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  But I was saying, even in their rigged market, we could be looking at 2,000, 3,000, 4,000.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  The sky's the limit from all of your research, and I know you guys are conservative.
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  Where should gold be for real inflation right now?
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:16.000]  $2,300 an ounce. That's what it would be, and that's according to many other people.
[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:22.000]  Other people have kept pace with inflation, and that's just the published inflation numbers, much less the real inflation numbers.
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  So we have a long way to go. Again, if I can stress this, the bad guys are running out of ammunition to keep the price down,
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  and you're going to see some kind of major league fireworks sometime this year.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:40.000]  But they do have a lot of money behind the scenes.
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  But they're running out of physical gold. That's their problem.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  They've gone through about 1,000 tons per year for 15 years.
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  So there's a supply-demand deficit of, say, that amount.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:59.000]  And they've kept the price under control on the way up by using this physical gold, but they're hitting the world.
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:05.000]  One of our guys, our consultants, predicted this. We had a conference in Durban, South Africa, May 10, 2001.
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:11.000]  He said, in seven to 10 years, they're going to run out of enough gold to keep the price from really taking off.
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  We're right in the middle of that zone right now.
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  Wow. So we could see this in the next month or the next two years, but time is on our side.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:27.000]  Yeah, it's coming. It's inevitable. I mean, it's just a matter of how much, again, how much ammunition they can come up with at a given time
[02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  to meet the growing physical market demand. So it's very exciting, very frustrating on a day-to-day basis.
[02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:40.000]  But again, we've been up 10 years in a row, and as you said earlier, the acceleration phase is still ahead of us.
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:46.000]  All right. In closing, we have the head of GATA, Bill Murphy, Chairman, Director of GATA on Weathers.
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.000]  Going back to the whistleblower, you say he and his family were hit by a car.
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:56.000]  I remember seeing that in the news that the person ran and that we haven't heard what's happened since then.
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:59.000]  How was Andrew McGuire doing? Have you had a chance to talk to him?
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:03.000]  He talks to my colleague, Adrian Doug. Doug was quite a bit.
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  There's a bunch of interviews people are talking to him over there, and I think he's going further with the legal counsel, the CFTC.
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:17.000]  So there's stuff going on behind the scenes, and it's a process. These investigations do take a long time.
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:22.000]  Well, let me do this with you. Let me put you on hold and have my producer talk to you.
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:28.000]  I would like to get you or your other colleague on with Mr. McGuire for a full hour sometime next week.
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  I think people need to hear directly from the whistleblower who saw these JPMorgan Chase people rubbing their hands together in glee.
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  Do you think that's doable, Mr. Murphy?
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:45.000]  I'd be fine with me. I have to go to Miami to meet somebody at the Financial Times next week, but I'd love to do it.
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:48.000]  I just have to see what Andrew's schedule is.
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  Okay, and you also talked about your other colleague that's working with him.
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:56.000]  Adrian Doug is an oil consultant, but he's free. I'm sure he'd love to do it.
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:59.000]  Sure. I mean, just the more the merrier, getting your different perspectives here.
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  I want to thank you for your tireless 11-year effort. It's certainly bearing fruit.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:11.000]  I mean, there you were, 260-something bucks an ounce back when you started, and it's 1,145 today.
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:14.000]  And so we're having a great victory.
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  I'm going to put you on hold, sir, and try to iron some of those basics out right now about getting the whistleblower on the show at your convenience.
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:28.000]  Andrew McGuire, perhaps we can get his contact info from you. Thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.000]  Anytime, Alex.
[02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:37.000]  All right, amazing information. We're going to get his info now with Jaren and get that set up.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  I tell you, folks, AP sued now it's 10 years ago and got all the internal minutes of the meetings between the Big Ten Oil companies.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  How they said there's too much oil. We're going to promote peak oil. We're going to tell the school kids and everybody there's no oil.
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  We're going to fund the environmental movement to brainwash people about this.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:02.000]  And we're going to buy up the independent refineries and shut them down.
[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  And we're going to restrict oil that way.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  And the Pentagon comes out last week and says there's no more oil.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:14.000]  And within two years, you're all going to be paying seven bucks a gallon water.
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  There's more water than ever. There's all these ways to get water, even in areas like Southern California.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  But they tell you, even in areas of washing water like England, oh, you're going to pay double, triple, quadruple now.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  There's no water when England has more water than any other island nation.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:37.000]  I mean, it's just the giant aquifers everywhere, incredible precipitation, huge reservoirs, and it's just scams.
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:44.000]  And here in Austin, they just say, hey, we are going to give you a 2.6 billion.
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.000]  This is Austin Energy tax over the next three years on your natural gas and power.
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  That's more than all the taxes every year combined, just one new tax, bigger than everything combined.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  And it's for the earth and for the children and just shut up.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:00.000]  We're going to do it. We're lawless scum.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  And who do they pay the money to? The banks.
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  And the city of Austin has taken almost all the pension funds and invested it in the derivatives.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  And now the bankers have come to them and said, you better raise a bunch of taxes because there's going to be no money.
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:18.000]  And they go and do, I mean, it's just, we have to get out of bed with these crooks.
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  You're like, well, I'm not working with the crooks. Well, neither am I, but we're still in bed with them.
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  We still live in a country that absolute criminal scum run and they've already committed millions of crimes.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  So why not commit 10 million more? Why not just steal everything?
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  They've already stolen everything that wasn't nailed down.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  Now they're in there with crowbars stealing what is nailed down.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.000]  They've taken the kitchen sink. They're pulling the tile up. They're pulling the drape sound.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  They're now bulldozing the building for timber.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  And we're in here with it collapsing going, hey, don't enslave us.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:52.000]  And they're saying, shut up terrorist. You're planning to stage terror attacks.
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  We're like, excuse me, we're just pointing out your crime.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:58.000]  Shut up terrorist. The police are going to come arrest you.
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  And we're what?
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:14.000]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:18.000]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:21.000]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:26.000]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:34.000]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:40.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:43.000]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:49.000]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:50.000]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:36.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:42.000]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:50.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:54:01.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:20.000]  Not a month ago, gold went down to about $1,050 an ounce. Ted bought a monster load of it and he does have a few of the coins at the $1,050 market level.
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  It's 1,145 right now and I believe in gold and silver and I buy my gold from Ted Anderson minus resources that owns this radio network and I believe me I've shopped around.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  There's some other good deals out there but nothing like this. He's still offering the free international international forecaster hard copy or twice a week digital copy and it's lengthy and excellent from Bob Chapman.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  When you buy a fifth of an ounce, European Frank for $249.68. That's basically gold at the $500 an ounce level once you factor in that savings.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  And they've got British sovereigns one fourth of an ounce and that's $312. They've got walking liberty half dollars at $975. These are just amazing prices.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  And I want to remind you this is the deal that Ted's been offering for over a month and it has gone up quite a bit, well, right at $100. Sometimes it's been above $100, sometimes lower $95 or so.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  It's about $95 up from that right now. So just again, Ted buys it when it's low, sells it to you when it's high at the old low price.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  So that's a win-win-win-win-win. 800-686-2237-800-686-2237. The brokers are there to take your order or to answer your questions.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  They've got a lot of other specials but to get the lower price, it's still a good deal if you get the current price, but to get the special price,
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  800-686-2237, tell them Alex Jones sent you. It's the Alex Jones special, 800-686-2337. Here at the end of this hour, I'm just going to thank some of the sponsors when we come back.
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  I'm going to get into the ADL, Southern Property Law Center. Everybody's saying send the police after Alex Jones, Ron Paul's a terrorist.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:18.000]  I mean, it's just reached a new level of insanity. I want to get into the big banking takeover, all the new taxes you'll be paying to the private central banks.
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  When we start the next hour and we'll also get into the amazing information from Dick Morris.
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  Bill Clinton personally was traded the 1993 Waco, Texas tragedy is the headline. We have the video of him saying that coming up.
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  Before we end this hour and start the jam-packed final fourth hour, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  One of them is survivalseedbank.com. Super high quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid seeds. I'd get one to plant in the spring and summer, get another to save.
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:54.000]  Plus, it's fun gardening and it's good to keep these heirloom seeds alive and well.
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  Survivalseedbank.com or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365. This is so important to do. The UN is hoarding seeds. Monsanto's buying them up and trying to get rid of the main seed lines that aren't GMO or hybrids so the plants don't produce seeds.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  So you can plant again from the plants you have. Survivalseedbank.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  And finally, I want to thank Pure Water Freedom. This is great systems they have.
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  They have filters for your home, filters for your shower because you absorb the fluoride and poisons, sodium fluoride, just as much as you drink it through your main organ, your skin.
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  Purewaterfreedom.com. If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:55.000]  That's one word. They have a full line of household fluoride filters. You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water including shower and bath filters. All their filters are made in the USA.
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:12.000]  Check out their banners on prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or go to purewaterfreedom.com to take control of your water supply and your family today.
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:24.000]  It's not enough to simply filter the water that you drink. If you filter the water you bathe in, that you brush your teeth with.
[02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:34.000]  We recently moved and have to now put a system in our house. We're probably going to go with purewaterfreedom.com because my children are bathing in the fluoride.
[02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  They are brushing their teeth with fluoride and remember this is going on. Go their ride back.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:51.000]  America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade. We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:56.000]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:59.000]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:04.000]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:09.000]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.
[02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:14.000]  We also have some specials. Some of our other films have prize when you order Shadow Government.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:25.000]  A new level in production quality and information exposes how a cashless society surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:34.000]  This film needs to be seen. Everybody needs to get it. So order yours today. Show it to your friends, your family, your church, your neighbors, your boss, your employees.
[02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:42.000]  Shadow Government, ladies and gentlemen, get your copy at infowars.com today. Shadow Government. It gives big brother a black eye.

[02:59:54.000 --> 03:00:01.000]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:15.000]  We are now into the fourth and final hour. Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  Coming up, the rhetoric isn't just rhetoric now. Coming out of the ADL and the Department of Law Center, it is authoritarian, it is tyrannical, it is despotic.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  It is the antithesis of a free society. They are calling for law enforcement to be used against the entire Patriot movement.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:45.000]  Southern Barber Law Center going after Ron Paul. It is just incredible. That is coming up.
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  Also, Dick Morris, Bill Clinton Presidency, orchestrated the 93 Waco, Texas tragedy. That is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  And the big banking takeover. You think the bailout of a year and a half ago was bad. You haven't seen nothing yet.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  But right now, I wanted to go back to a few of your phone calls. Let's talk to Judy in New York. You're on the air, Judy. Thanks for holding.
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  Hi. I have a couple questions. I'm very happy to talk to you. I've listened to you for a long time. One of them is Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:27.000]  Do you know much about what was behind that? Yes. The LA Times reported he was a deep-cover CIA operative, also involved in the MKUltra program.
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:38.000]  And he was basically set up. And how they do that is they threaten to kill your whole family if you don't basically indict yourself.
[03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:41.000]  And so he's just one of their people they set up.
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:49.000]  The reason I'm asking is because his brother, I'm going to go hear his brother talk tonight. And his brother apparently does not know any of this.
[03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  And his brother has suffered a lot. I heard his brother turned him in.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  Well, I mean, his brother doesn't know that it was in the LA Times in an article by Alexander Cockburn who went and got the records from Harvard and was at Stanford.
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:14.000]  Guys, Google Theodore Kaczynski's CIA LA Times. Let me get that exact university correct. But no, he was in the CIA.
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  And he was in the MKUltra program as a volunteer. And that has been in major newspapers.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  That was in the LA Times, one of the publications. But go ahead, ma'am.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:36.000]  Well, I'll tell his brother that information. It sounded like he didn't know it according to the newspaper article. But I'll tell him that.
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  The other thing is they're trying to take over the mayors, trying to take over the school districts, the city school districts.
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  Is there an agenda behind that?
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  Yeah, they put in government schooling that's designed to dumb the kids down. They always give it more and more money.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  And then they purely federalize it now with federal standards in no child left behind. And so the process of the type of education where the government will decide what you're going to be when you grow up.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:16.000]  And they're going to incentivize it where they give you the money if you do what you're told and become what they tell you to be with incentives for tuition.
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  They're also turning many public schools into military academies. So just, you know, we're going the way Russia was 60 years ago and Russia's going in the opposite direction.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  Right now they're just doing it with City School District. They're not doing it with suburban schools. Do you think it'll change?
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:41.000]  They're doing it here. Boston has it. And they're trying to do it with Rochester City Schools.
[03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  Yeah, I know Chicago's doing it as well. And Bill Gates and Warren Buffer are involved in some of the private funding of that as well.
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  And that's just so they can take over education and make it even worse.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000]  Okay.
[03:03:54.000 --> 03:04:06.000]  Okay. And the last thing, Anderson Cooper was on last night on CNN and they were talking about Barry Sitaro not being born in the United States.
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  They were laughing at it. They said people are crazy. They were just all laughing at it. The two guys he had on plus Anderson Cooper.
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  They were making a joke out of it.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  Well, that's what the Nazis would do in 37, 38 and 39. People would say they're arresting people. They're disappearing.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:30.000]  They'd go on the radio and the Nazis would laugh. And Poland said the Germans are massing troops. They may invade us.
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  One week before, the German radio and newsreels, people would watch TV pretty much in the theaters. They didn't have television then.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  And well, the Nazis actually by then had public TVs that they had some in public areas they were broadcasting on.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:48.000]  But mainly newsreels and they would laugh.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:55.000]  Oh, they say there's a world government. The banks are robbing us. They say there's police brutality.
[03:04:55.000 --> 03:05:01.000]  Tell me another one.
[03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:04.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:10.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  Now or after the battle starts, when will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:33.000]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:36.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:42.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:45.000]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:56.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:05:56.000 --> 03:06:02.000]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:10.000]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned.
[03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:21.000]  As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:27.000]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:32.000]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:41.000]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:51.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own colloidal silver right from home.
[03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:55.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:07:02.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:07.000]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:13.000]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:18.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:25.000]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:33.000]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:39.000]  So visit them today at www.survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:46.000]  That's www.survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:50.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:55.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:07:55.000 --> 03:08:19.000]  This is Alex Jones for www.survivalseedbank.com.
[03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:30.000]  We're asking about Ted Kaczynski, the unabomber, and what his story was.
[03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  And without spending a lot of time on this, because I've got to get to the most important news of the day here,
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:39.000]  in the last hour, here's a counter punch written by Alexander Cockburn.
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:42.000]  He also wrote an article for the L.A. Times on this.
[03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:46.000]  This is Ted Kaczynski, the CIA and LSD.
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:56.000]  And then this goes into the Harvard records of him volunteering for CIA mind control experiments and his connections to the CIA.
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:01.000]  If people want to read that, it's Ted K, the CIA and LSD.
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:06.000]  I was right, it was Harvard that he worked with the CIA with.
[03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  Okay, this next issue, I've already covered it some earlier, but I want to speak to it now in more detail,
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  is so horrible, so off the charts, so bad, that I don't even know what to say, really.
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:30.000]  I mean, I hate to get into something like this without covering it all.
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:36.000]  I mean, playing the clips off MSNBC where they're saying it's sedition to criticize the government.
[03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  We should be arrested.
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  That was said by CFR member on Monday.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  We played that yesterday.
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:51.000]  Clips on Face the Nation saying that alternative blogging is a form of terrorism.
[03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  We played that yesterday.
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:58.000]  Michael Savage going further than he's ever gone saying the government is going to stage terror attacks.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  Again, he did that Monday, so it's good that some big talk show hosts are seeing what this is a setup.
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:12.000]  Bill Clinton last Friday saying that, gee, if the Tea Parties don't stop their rhetoric saying the government's corrupt and tyrannical,
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  it's going to cause another Oklahoma City.
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  And gee, I hope that doesn't have to happen to shut you up.
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:24.000]  These are very thinly veiled threats.
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:29.000]  And then you have the black congressional caucus caught going out in the Tea Parties, trying to start fights,
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:34.000]  claiming they were spit on and called the N-word, and it was all alive from all the camera angles.
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  And you've got Democratic Party operatives caught going out with Nazi signs all over the country at Tea Parties.
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  We told you about that a month ago.
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:46.000]  It finally broke in the Associated Press last week and is now a big national news story.
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:53.000]  And I've heard most of the big conservative talk show hosts talk about it finally because this is very dangerous.
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  And then two days ago, we read the New Southern Poverty Law Center report.
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  You know, they're not going after the Ku Klux Klan of the Aryan Nations these days,
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:06.000]  which in most cases it's come out they're federal operatives.
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:11.000]  What, two months ago it came out in court that Hal Turner was a FBI agent, not operative agent,
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:21.000]  running all these hate sites and calling for judges to be killed and saying that, you know, I'm a Jewish agent and all this stuff.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  Why do you have government-funded groups that do that?
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:24.000]  They want to radicalize everything.
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  They want to make it racial.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:29.000]  They want to discredit a movement that's diverse.
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:34.000]  I mean, 99.9% of us, the banking takeover is bad.
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:38.000]  And I'm going to get into the latest open announcement of world government.
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:43.000]  And they are now attempting at the national and international level to pass laws and sign agreements
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  where you will pay tax money directly to private central banks, VAT, financial VAT,
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:52.000]  manufacturing, value-added, sales taxes, carbon taxes.
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:55.000]  It's now all public.
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  IMF, global taxes, can only be enforced through global government.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  Bankers prepare to assault Americans with VAT transaction.
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  Here's the London Guardian breaking it down.
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:14.000]  Here is the president and CEO of the Texas Banking Association basically saying exactly what I'm saying,
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  because this is the big mega top eight banks in the U.S., 14, maybe 15 worldwide, depending on how you class them.
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  They're taking over all their competition that doesn't unfairly create derivatives
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  and then use it to take over the world finance system.
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  So we're going to be going over all of that in the latest on Obama.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:38.000]  Denies link in timing of SEC case.
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  He refuses to give back the Goldman Sachs million dollars he was given.
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:47.000]  Also, millions face tax increase under Democrats budget plan.
[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:50.000]  Obama suggests value-added tax may be an option.
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:52.000]  They announced the new $100 bill.
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:54.000]  Even Vanity Fair says it looks like the euro.
[03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:59.000]  So they're getting you ready to recall all the old money and give you the new devalued money.
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:00.000]  Inflation is way up.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:04.000]  They've got numbers here on clothes, food, you name it.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:05.000]  Here's AP.
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:08.000]  Wholesale prices rise in March as food costs jump.
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  So inflation is starting to rear its ugly head.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:14.000]  Greek debt crisis gets worse as EU revises figures.
[03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.000]  That was all engineered by Goldman Sachs.
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  The usual parties have now been indicted.
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  So we're going to be covering that because it's this banking group, this cartel,
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:28.000]  who financed Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL,
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:32.000]  who financed the training of the FBI and law enforcement through the ADL.
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:37.000]  That's the main group that trains them to be political police or commasars,
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  an apparatchik's system, as the Russians had.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  So they're involved in this hostile corporate looting and this takeover of society,
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:53.000]  very draconian, horrible for the average person.
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:57.000]  I mean, maybe good for six, 7,000 people in the superclass as Rothkopf,
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000]  who we had on two years ago.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000]  He wouldn't come on after he was interviewed.
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:06.000]  The head of the Kissinger Group, the Washington Post, wrote a big story about it,
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:10.000]  saying world government's here and it's run by the 6,000 superclass.
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  So maybe 6,000 people benefit from this.
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:19.000]  The rest of us certainly don't and it's completely illegal.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:24.000]  So we're here peacefully as citizens with a First Amendment.
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:27.000]  Talking about this is all right.
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:30.000]  And we say, hey, we don't want your government health care.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  Oh, you're a racist.
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  Hey, the insurance companies wrote this as Ron Paul and Lord Mockden and others are saying,
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000]  not just me saying that, I've read the bill.
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:42.000]  So see, it's not just some socialism for poor.
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:47.000]  No, it cuts the benefits, raises taxes and makes you buy insurance from these insurance companies.
[03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000]  They lower the standard of care.
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  You come out against that.
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  They invoke racism all over the news, all over newspapers and say, you are a racist.
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  You hate black people.
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:05.000]  See, they don't want blacks and Hispanics and Asians joining the populist, peaceful,
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000]  uprising to restore the Republic.
[03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  And so they want to use racial politics to divide us.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000]  I mean, that is so criminal.
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:13.000]  That is so dastardly.
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:14.000]  That is so horrible.
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:19.000]  That is so racist and balkanizing in its very nature.
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  So the American people can't get together.
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  They're caught again, provocaturing events.
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  They're caught staging all these events.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:32.000]  And one of their biggest tactics, and I've had to hire moderators,
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:39.000]  and I've had to go to registration on info wars and prison planet just to try to stop this.
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  You can go to YouTube, Google, Yahoo, any big newspaper website.
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  It's got comments and there's calls for violence and usually it's government provocateurs
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  trying to single people out and it's come out in court thousands of times.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:53.000]  They are doing this, but there are some nuts out there.
[03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:58.000]  And what the London Guardian and the New York Times and Time Magazine
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:02.000]  and the Southern Poverty Law Center and all of George Soros' publications,
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:08.000]  Media Matters, Huffington Post, I mean, literally, it's got to be more than a hundred.
[03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:13.000]  That just in the last six months have said, I'm calling for killing police.
[03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:17.000]  They say, falsely, they say, I'm calling for killing IRS agents.
[03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:20.000]  They say, I'm calling for violent overthrow of the government.
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:24.000]  And anyone who's listened or seen my films knows it's the opposite.
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:30.000]  And they're saying that we are change, who's Mahatma Gandhi, nonviolence,
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:33.000]  is their poster person.
[03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:37.000]  That's what they have up on their website when you enter the site.
[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:40.000]  So it's just a complete hoax.
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:45.000]  The American people not wanting to go into debt servitude or not racist, that's a hoax.
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:50.000]  These claims that people criticizing government corruption
[03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:53.000]  are going to cause federal buildings to be blown up is a hoax.
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:56.000]  And it will be elements of the government or private intelligence agencies
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:58.000]  that will carry out these attacks.
[03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:01.000]  And I've been telling you the last year and intensely the last three and a half months
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:05.000]  that this would happen in April or May, that they're building towards a crescendo.
[03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:11.000]  And now I've got every day CNN, Nightline, PBS.
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000]  I mean, the phone is ringing off the hook.
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:16.000]  They're going to come interview me and they ask me, am I causing terrorism?
[03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:21.000]  Am I a terrorist? Do I feel bad about violence setting me up for a fall?
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  To the point that I'm not even calling these people back most of the time.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:28.000]  Just because I don't even want to be around them.
[03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:34.000]  And I don't care about being on their national television.
[03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:40.000]  So all of that said, that back story there for you,
[03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:43.000]  we have this ADL report out today.
[03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:47.000]  Now, two days ago, Southern Property Law Center said myself, Ron Paul,
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:52.000]  Andrew Napolitano are quote, extremist terrorist enablers.
[03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:55.000]  So now they're going after Ron Paul, folks.
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:18:00.000]  I mean, couldn't be more peaceful, more genteel, you know, the elder statesman,
[03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:04.000]  former federal judge, Napolitano, couldn't be a better guy.
[03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:09.000]  They're going after him because they're getting ready to stage events
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:10.000]  on the American people.
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:17.000]  Well, now the ADL has come out and has found mild statements on prisonplanet.com
[03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:24.000]  like, my gosh, when are the American people going to riot like they did in Kyrgyzstan?
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  And then they imply that I'm pushing this, I'm doing this.
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:32.000]  And they say, quote, major law enforcement operation is needed against us
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:35.000]  because we are advocating for the overthrow of the country.
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:40.000]  I mean, think about that, you've got these groups who are demonizing
[03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:43.000]  anyone that criticizes the government, anyone that criticizes health care,
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:50.000]  and they're now moving in to saying, we need to call the police on these people.
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:54.000]  Within three hours of Joe Stack flying his plane into that building supposedly,
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.000]  a lot of questions there.
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:19:00.000]  It was in the Austin American Statesman, New York Daily News,
[03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:04.000]  with headlines about web praises attack, Internet praises attack.
[03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:07.000]  And then they just said in there, very deceptively,
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:12.000]  by mixing me into other website comments from other websites, that I was for it.
[03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:17.000]  And I said, this is the sick law enforcement on me because we're hurting them badly.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:21.000]  And they'll go show this to cops and say, we got to get him, you know, plant pipe bombs on him,
[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  and we know cops will do that.
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:27.000]  I mean, there's no, I say pipe bombs because they, half the time, that's what, you know,
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  that's how they get you.
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  You know, they just bury something on your property.
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:37.000]  And so ADL calls for major law enforcement operation to deal with Obamacare critics.
[03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:41.000]  Attack group mixes in completely nonviolent Internet postings from our websites
[03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:48.000]  with death threats from other sites in new purge against Internet dissent.
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:54.000]  And then that dovetails with DHS boss says Tea Party will engage in violence.
[03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:57.000]  Napolitano, the bad Napolitano, not the good Napolitano.
[03:19:57.000 --> 03:20:02.000]  And we'll talk about where this is going on the other side of this quick break. Stay with us.
[03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:07.000]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor
[03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:10.000]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:14.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher.
[03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:19.000]  Alkivision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:25.000]  Using plasma pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:27.000]  and regain your health and energy.
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy level.
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:35.000]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste
[03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:44.000]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:50.000]  Order your bottle of Alkivision plasma pH drops now by going directly to Alkivision.com.
[03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:56.000]  That's Alkivision.com or call 269-409-1776.

[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:05.000]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:11.000]  to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:16.000]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the Fiat continental system.
[03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:21.000]  Wisdom being lost with time, the government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit
[03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:27.000]  has colluded with private business, creating the largest Fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:32.000]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:36.000]  but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:41.000]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:46.000]  Hi this is Ted Anderson. I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:53.000]  Call me today at 800-686-2237. I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.

[03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:06.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:11.000]  This tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:14.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:26.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:32.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:36.000]  The police state forward chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:43.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:46.000]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:52.000]  It's only the beginning of the Mule-Odders hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.
[03:22:52.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prismplanet.tv.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:03.000]  Hi, this is Steve Shanky, FoodStragg.
[03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:10.000]  We have stopped taking orders for the Buy 3 Get 1 Free program and have started production. Congratulations.
[03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:16.000]  Your choice to participate in the production of your food supply by pre-ordering will prove very wise.
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:21.000]  Shipments will begin the end of March and will be sent in the order that they were received.
[03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.000]  Now something fun. It's springtime.
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:31.000]  We all know that garden seeds aren't really a food supply, but they're a great supplement to your food reserve if you have the time and place to garden.
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:32.000]  Here's the plan.
[03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:41.000]  When you add a one-month superfood spring pack to your food storage, we'll send you that garden of non-high-bread seeds absolutely free.
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000]  Order now while the free seeds last.
[03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:50.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:54.000]  Get a real supply of food to eat while you wait for your supplemental garden to grow.
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  Call 800-409-5633 eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  Family on my father and mother's side.
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:28.000]  Two of the people on the Mayflower on my mom's side.
[03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:30.000]  One on my father's side.
[03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:36.000]  My family just all over the place in the Revolutionary War, all over the place in the battle for Texas Independence.
[03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:40.000]  The Heirs family on my mom's side raised Colonel Travis's son.
[03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:43.000]  Both my grandfathers fought in World War II.
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:46.000]  We're enlisted in World War II.
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  One of them flew B-17s over Europe.
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:25:08.000]  And it makes me fundamentally angry to have the Southern Poverty Law Center, mainstream media, the ADL knowingly lying and saying I'm calling for killing police and military and IRS.
[03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:12.000]  And it makes me even more angry to know that they're setting up the American people.
[03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:19.000]  Good American people finally starting to wake up across the political paradigm.
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:22.000]  Congress has a 10% approval rating.
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:25.000]  Nancy Pelosi has a 9% approval rating.
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:28.000]  The Republicans have a low approval rating.
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  The people know that we're going under the fraud, just like Mexico and countless other third world nations have fallen to it.
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:46.000]  And it's 100% clear that the government and its mouthpieces are saying that the American people are basically terrorists if they criticize anything.
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  And to be singled out with Ron Paul and Judge Napolitano and others is an honor.
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  But it's also dangerous because they single me out more than even Ron Paul.
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:04.000]  More than anybody else, they single Alex Jones out and they slander me, they lie about me, they do whatever they want.
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  They defame me, and they're such liars that on the surface it shouldn't matter.
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:18.000]  But it matters because the ADL and Southern Property Law Center are the main trainers of law enforcement.
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  They teach them how to be political, secret police operatives, and these cops believe the crap they're being given.
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000]  A lot of them do.
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:29.000]  They believe it.
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  And the system is setting up a war between the American people and the American people that happen to be police officers in the military.
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:40.000]  And they're openly saying they want to use the military against the American people.
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  I'm going to play a clip coming back where they call us seditious and that we should be arrested.
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  And Napolitano is saying people that are watched that are rhetoric, you know, she just walked through Oklahoma City 15 years after when that was 100% a government operation.
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:27:00.000]  And we've been covering that with eyewitnesses and others earlier in the week.
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  But the fact that the ADL is calling for law enforcement action against us is a new level.
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:24.000]  And the fact that the Democratic Party operatives have been caught with Nazi signs and things trying to demonize mainline American citizens so that we'll be at each other's throats in a race war is despicable and is illegal.
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:40.000]  And is so off the chart, so obvious that the system is preparing to stage all sorts of provocateur actions and blowing up federal buildings, blowing up IRS buildings, attacking military installations.
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:44.000]  You're going to see more of this perpetrated by these people.
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:56.000]  They're speaking to the most dumbed down segments of society that are kind of halfway paying attention to the TV when they're cooking dinner or halfway paying attention to the TV in the coffee room at work or halfway reading headlines.
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  Where FBI says homegrown the biggest threat.
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:02.000]  Obama says we're going to be nuked homegrown may be involved.
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:09.000]  You know, government says Tea Party's racist government says, I mean, they're really setting this up.
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:18.000]  And you have to ask yourself what is the message that we're putting out that has them engaging in this wild of an action.
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:22.000]  Well, it shows that the system's going for broke.
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:28.000]  They've committed so many crimes done so much evil that they know the people are now getting wise to what they're doing.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  So they've got to stage some events to clamp down on free speech to arrest people to create a chilling effect.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:46.000]  They think you're going to cower and they're angry at the information I'm putting out and Apollo Thanos putting out and Ron Paul's putting out and Chuck Baldwin's putting out because we're just telling the truth.
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:52.000]  I mean, you know, when the government declassifies that they're recording all the naked body images and that's now in the news today.
[03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:54.000]  When you go through a body scanner.
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:56.000]  I mean, that's common sense that that's wrong.
[03:28:56.000 --> 03:29:00.000]  Or when schools are recording kids at home over laptops.
[03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:07.000]  That's wrong or when Goldman Sachs engineers, the banking collapse to consolidate power and loot the economy.
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:08.000]  And it's mainstream news.
[03:29:08.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  Of course, we said it years ago.
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.000]  So now we've got credibility.
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:14.000]  That's why they're coming after us because we're focused.
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:15.000]  We're well spoken.
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:16.000]  We're constitutionalist.
[03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:18.000]  We're real Americans.
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:20.000]  We're the good guys.
[03:29:20.000 --> 03:29:29.000]  And this signifies and a hundred percent shows that the system is going to come in with oppression and real.
[03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:36.000]  The real tyranny, hot tyranny, not cold, creeping tyranny, but really oppressive tyranny.
[03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:39.000]  When they start calling for arrest, I mean, that's what the Nazis did.
[03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:42.000]  They said arrest people that criticize the government.
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:43.000]  That's treason.
[03:29:43.000 --> 03:30:00.000]  We'll be right back to continue and break down the bank's big final move to take over society.
[03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:22.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:30.000]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[03:30:30.000 --> 03:30:35.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:40.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[03:30:40.000 --> 03:30:47.000]  We turn jeans inside out diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:05.000]  You may be arrested and or subjected to other police action.
[03:31:05.000 --> 03:31:10.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:31:10.000 --> 03:31:13.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:18.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.

[03:31:25.000 --> 03:31:31.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.

[03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:49.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:31:49.000 --> 03:31:52.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[03:33:01.000 --> 03:33:26.000]  For 14-plus years, I analyzed the merger of the military and the police, the cameras, the cell phones being tracked in live time, the warrantless wiretapping,
[03:33:26.000 --> 03:33:34.000]  the training military and police were being given declassified and leaked government documents that were confirmed to be bonafide and authentic.
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:50.000]  And it was 100% clear then that a classical oppressive tyranny, similar to communist China, Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, East Germany under the Soviets after 45, was being set up.
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:53.000]  That was 100%.
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:34:00.000]  But now we have the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, now we have the Patriot Act and I've read both, we've covered them here on air.
[03:34:00.000 --> 03:34:12.000]  Now we have the Federal Governors' Commission, now we have the training documents, now we have the White House memos, now we have the Army Field Manuals and it's more than 100%.
[03:34:12.000 --> 03:34:27.000]  It is a joke how much evidence we have that a high-tech classical tyranny, so a tyranny with a high-tech overlay is being set up and now we know they're beginning to pull the trigger on how these are rolled out.
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:39.000]  How the Zars did it, how the Nazis did it, how the communists did it after the Zars, by staging terror attacks and provocaturing groups as a pretext to go after the population,
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:45.000]  the legitimate population that says no, you're not going to rob us, you're not going to carry out the criminal looting.
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:55.000]  That's all tyranny is, powerful entrants get in and start robbing the hell out of people and they get away with it for decades and they get worse and worse and worse and then more and more evil people compete with each other
[03:34:55.000 --> 03:35:05.000]  until in the final round you get a Hitler, you get a Stalin, you get a Mao, you get a Julius Caesar, you get a Pol Pot.
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:20.000]  And they have studied and they brag, they call it the final revolution of scientific tyranny, they have studied how this has been done in other countries and they've got high-tech PR and mind control and conditioning and propaganda and spin
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:31.000]  and now they're coming out and saying, okay, Homeland Security is for the American people and you are the number one threat and we're going to lie about you and say you're violent and we're going to tell our attack dogs
[03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:38.000]  that you want to kill them and our attack dogs are going to come and they're going to kill you.
[03:35:38.000 --> 03:35:42.000]  And so they're out in the open saying, look, we're going to start a fight with you.
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:50.000]  We've already told everybody you're a terrorist, now we're going to take everything you got and if you even criticize what we're doing, we're going to eat your lunch.
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  Now, if you give in to this intimidation, if you let this chill you, because I'm being honest about what they're doing and that's scary,
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:01.000]  but I believe more in you than the globalists do.
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:12.000]  They believe you're cowards, they believe you're weak, they're going for broke because they think they can win and they're even accelerating it faster because they're starting to get scared going, whoa,
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:24.000]  they're standing up more than we thought they would and they're figuring things out and so that's making them even pile more oppression and intimidation onto this.
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  And so we are at the crossroads and all of you have to make the decision.
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:33.000]  If you're a cop listening, look, you don't have to believe me, officers.
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  If you just not go bowling tonight or not take your girlfriend out tonight or, you know, not go to the shooting range or whatever it is you're going to do tonight,
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:53.000]  and if you just go research what I'm telling you, then you'd find out I was telling you the truth and you could do something about it.
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:37:00.000]  Now, most of you already know this is true and you're making a subconscious decision to keep your head down and just go with the flow.
[03:37:00.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  If you do that, if you do that, you're going to look back on this time years from now and you're going to wish to heaven you'd have done something different
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:17.000]  because this is the most vicious systematic evil I have ever seen in world history and I've studied history.
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:25.000]  Dr. Roberts, former Wall Street Journal editor, father of Reaganomics, a historian, a very intelligent said, he's analyzed this.
[03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:31.000]  This is the most duplicitous, calculated, focused evil ever upon the planet.
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:42.000]  And it's not even our government, it's this corporate management structure worldwide that is doing this.
[03:37:42.000 --> 03:37:52.000]  And we are now at that juncture. We could be days, weeks, months, I'm not sure, away from massive terror attacks.
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:38:00.000]  And again, the government's preparing with the propaganda for nuke attacks. You've seen them.
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  Then they just shut down all the major communications and they wouldn't even have to kill me because I won't be on air. You won't be on the internet.
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:17.000]  And they've gutted whole civilizations. I mean, they'll do it. They'll do it.
[03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  And that's why now while we can still talk, we need to get the word out, scream bloody murder from the rooftops, never stop.
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  And a lot of you who are well to do and intelligent and understand what's happening, you're going to have to get off the fence
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:42.000]  and speak to your neighbors and call them to talk radio and start websites and call Congress and call the ADL and just let them know that we know what they're doing.
[03:38:42.000 --> 03:38:50.000]  And pressure national talk show host like Limbaugh and Savage who are now seeing the government may stage terror that they're both now coming out in the open.
[03:38:50.000 --> 03:39:00.000]  And that's because there's another power structure that isn't the top power structure, but as part of it, who now realizes they're going to get their throat slit in this as well.
[03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:09.000]  No one is safe, including top level elitists because after they're done mopping up America, in every case, tyranny works the same.
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  They're the most dangerous group to be in is an upper echelon elitist because you know where the bodies are buried.
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:29.000]  You know how the system works. If they're successful setting this up, I would say half of the superclass will be killed.
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:41.000]  And we're going down this road, you know, the Rothschilds out of England funded Hitler and Stalin and the West and the French Rothschild family were almost all killed by Hitler.
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:43.000]  And that's on record. They were killed.
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:53.000]  And I've seen the daughter of Lord Rothschild out of France talk about it on Charlie Rose once, but I already read about it in history books.
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:40:01.000]  What they're conjuring, what they're building, what they have unleashed, they have released the Kraken.
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  This is an uncontrollable force of evil because they put so many evil, reprobate, wicked people into positions in corporate areas, government areas, law enforcement areas that it is an incredibly dangerous animal that they released.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:31.000]  And no one is safe from this. I mean, this is, this is so diabolical.
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  Now, I want to get into what they are setting up now on the financial end, because that's the heart of it, the capstone of this system.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:49.000]  And then Dick Morris, Bill Clinton personally illustrated the 93 Waco, Texas tragedy. I want to hurry through this now, but you have been warned.
[03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:57.000]  You have been warned and I have risked my life and my name and, and, and, and prison to bring you this information.
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:07.000]  And I've taken more Co and tell pro and mainstream media and government attacks than anybody in recent memory.
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:11.000]  And that's the proof of what we're saying is right, but you can go look at all of this for yourself.
[03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  I mean, yesterday I read the entire London Guardian article that is a deceptive piece saying, boy, the bankers are in trouble.
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:22.000]  This is really going to bring the big banks in line.
[03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:35.000]  Then you read the actual G 20 document, the biggest central banks set it up to shut down their competition and to put value added taxes on all financial transactions of individuals, small banks, credit unions, everything.
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:48.000]  And it pays the money to a global government level system that Gordon Brown, we played the clips here, has called a global governance constitution between the banks.
[03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:59.000]  And again, you can also go read an article written by Eric Sandberg, president, CEO of Texas bankers association.
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:07.000]  I was actually this morning doing looking for a Texas bank to put our business capital in.
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  And I was finding out what had the highest ratings.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:20.000]  And without even as I separately look for regional bank groups pointing out because I read the read the G 20 plan and what Obama's doing.
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:26.000]  And it's meant to shut down and take over all their competition because these banks don't get to create derivatives.
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:30.000]  You're healthy, regional and even small town banks.
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:36.000]  They're not allowed to play in that game, not just that they're moral, a lot of Martin, but they're not allowed.
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:38.000]  Only the big globalists are allowed.
[03:42:38.000 --> 03:42:39.000]  That's how they can buy everything up.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:43.000]  But now they're coming in to take them over.
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  And so I'd separately found articles with different banking associations saying this, but separately looking for the highest rated Texas bank.
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:58.000]  Found out what prosperity is probably one of the better ones.
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  But doing that, I came across this by the president of the Texas bankers association to politically connected to fail.
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:14.000]  And he says this is a takeover by fat cat bankers of your local bank.
[03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:17.000]  And he goes into how it's a giant scam.
[03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:18.000]  I mean, you should go read it.
[03:43:18.000 --> 03:43:19.000]  This is not Alex Jones.
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:25.000]  This is a Texas has the more healthy banks, the biggest banks in the union, bigger than California.
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:26.000]  They're bankrupt.
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:29.000]  Texas has the best banks in the union.
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:34.000]  And that's Forbes and Barons.
[03:43:34.000 --> 03:43:38.000]  And here's the head of the association telling you what I'm telling you.
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:39.000]  Okay.
[03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:44.000]  So you should go read this editorial about the president CEO of the Texas banker association.
[03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:46.000]  I want to get him on next week if he'll do it.
[03:43:46.000 --> 03:43:48.000]  I want to get him on.
[03:43:48.000 --> 03:43:50.000]  I mean, we've got to ring the alarm bell here.
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:52.000]  I mean, this is, this is incredible.
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  You read this G 20 plan that's in the guardian article we linked to yesterday.
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:02.000]  And you read the quote, oh, Obama's getting tough on the banks that financed him.
[03:44:02.000 --> 03:44:07.000]  And it is just the opposite of what they're saying.
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:17.000]  Anything you get government health care, a banker bailout, whatever it is, it's going to be a ripoff by the private central banks that are waging war on the real market.
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  Now we have two articles that detail this at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com by Paul Joseph Watson and Steve Watson.
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:32.000]  And every line, every claim we make is linked to government documents or mainstream news with a hidden in plain view.
[03:44:32.000 --> 03:44:33.000]  Okay.
[03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:35.000]  Because they'll tell you in the London Guardian, oh, it's a great idea.
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  It'll get the bad bankers and it says, gives them unlimited power, selective enforcement over all small banks and pays the money directly to them.
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:42.000]  Oh, that will sure show them.
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:45.000]  That's like giving Jeffrey Dahmer 10 more teenagers a torture to death.
[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:46.000]  I'm sure he'll hate it.
[03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:51.000]  IMF's global taxes can only be enforced through global government.
[03:44:51.000 --> 03:45:02.000]  And then it goes through Gordon Brown saying it's global government that they are establishing and that it will be run by private central banks.
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  Latest proposals part of ongoing centralization into new economic world order.
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:09.000]  That's their term for it.
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:19.000]  As you have no doubt read in the headlines today, the IMF has proposed levying two global taxes on the world's banks to make sure those greedy guys don't get us in too much trouble again.
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:32.000]  If that sounds dubious, it is because in reality, what's being proposed and has been falling into place for some time as a framework of unelected global authority with powers above and beyond those of sovereign governments run by the private central banks.
[03:45:32.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  And then it goes into all the VAT, the financial VAT, on your electronic money transfers, on everything and total enforcement power at the national and UN level over your local banks.
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:51.000]  And so it goes into it in detail.
[03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:59.000]  And then another important article, bankers prepared to assault Americans with VAT transaction tax.
[03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:05.000]  And then we have Obama here in the Associated Press today.
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:08.000]  Obama suggests value added tax may be an option.
[03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:16.000]  And separately in the Senate, they have the carbon tax that's a VAT on all human activity.
[03:46:16.000 --> 03:46:24.000]  But the most important article to read to understand the lies is they'll tell you a lie but then admit what they're doing right next to it.
[03:46:24.000 --> 03:46:30.000]  And it says Gordon Brown claims credit for international monetary plan to impose tough levy on biggest banks profits say.
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:32.000]  Then later it says it isn't on the biggest banks.
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:34.000]  It's selectively enforced.
[03:46:34.000 --> 03:46:36.000]  It's secretive how it's done.
[03:46:36.000 --> 03:46:38.000]  And it's a value added tax.
[03:46:38.000 --> 03:46:40.000]  Let me read this to you.
[03:46:40.000 --> 03:46:47.000]  On all financial institutions, not just banks and transactions.
[03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:50.000]  So, oh, this will really show the big central banks.
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:53.000]  This will sure teach them.
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:55.000]  Now, I want to digress for a moment.
[03:46:55.000 --> 03:46:57.000]  We'll cover this more tomorrow.
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:46:59.000]  We've got guests coming on throughout the week.
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:08.000]  And next week, because I forgot to play these clips earlier when I was talking about the domestic demonization that I want to get into wake up.
[03:47:08.000 --> 03:47:13.000]  This is CFR globalist on Chris Matthews.
[03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:19.000]  What Mr. Klein calling for sedition saying it's sedition to criticize the government.
[03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:23.000]  It's not an American right. It's sedition. Let's play this clip.
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:27.000]  We just watched Sarah Palin and she said an American.
[03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:29.000]  Now she said it was just his policies, not him.
[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:31.000]  But those words are license words.
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:33.000]  They're permission words.
[03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:35.000]  I did a little bit of research just before the show.
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:37.000]  It's on this little napkin here.
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:45.000]  I looked up the definition of sedition, which is conduct or language inciting rebellion against the authority of the state.
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  And a lot of these statements, especially the ones coming from people like Glenn Beck and to a certain extent, Sarah Palin were right next, right up close to being seditious.
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:48:01.000]  This is, and you know, it shows right and I'll name another person.
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  You know, name is Bear.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  You can watch the whole clip at Info Wars in prison planet.
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:09.000]  And then they go around the table all agreeing.
[03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:13.000]  I mean, there's so many of these clips now.
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:20.000]  Here's Napolitano, the Homeland Security head, you know, basically saying, yes, these domestic groups criticizing.
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:23.000]  They're tied into radicals and they may cause an Oklahoma city.
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  So they're setting everybody up for when they stage the event blaming it on the American people.
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:34.000]  So the banks and crooks taking over America and silence dissent because what they're doing so illegal.
[03:48:34.000 --> 03:48:38.000]  If the made off types running this, the Ken lay types running this can't silence us.
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:40.000]  They're all going to go to prison and it's game over.
[03:48:40.000 --> 03:48:42.000]  It's all or nothing exercise.
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:43.000]  Here it is.
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:45.000]  The question is not ideology.
[03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:55.000]  The question is groups that are going from beliefs or or ideology that we've always had groups on on all sides that have
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:49:01.000]  beliefs that are very strong and express them very vociferously with which we may agree or not agree.
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:04.000]  The question is the turn to violence.
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  You know, I was in Oklahoma City just yesterday and that when whenever you go to Oklahoma City,
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:20.000]  you need to go to the memorial and you need to walk through that museum and that will teach you the difference between those
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:29.000]  who are merely expressing themselves with loudly and with anger and the violence that we must seek to prevent.
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:31.000]  So what they're doing is in Clinton went even further.
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:35.000]  I said, I hope we don't have to have another one of these to make the Tea Party shut up.
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:42.000]  But then meanwhile, there's surrogates, the ADL Southern Property Law Center, all this other news media is claiming that we're
[03:49:42.000 --> 03:49:45.000]  going to cause this to happen and law enforcement needs to come after it.
[03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  So that's what they're moving to do.
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:52.000]  They've got all these different White House SARS calling for censoring talk radio, censoring the Internet.
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:49:55.000]  All of this is building steam now.
[03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:57.000]  All of this is accelerating.
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:49:59.000]  And you can see the battle plan.
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:02.000]  They did this in the lead up to 95 bombing that they engineered.
[03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:06.000]  You can see how they do the preconditioning before it happens.
[03:50:06.000 --> 03:50:08.000]  I mean, it's just crystal clear.
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:11.000]  It's like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:12.000]  What comes next?
[03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:13.000]  7.
[03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:14.000]  What comes next?
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  8.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  What comes next?
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:17.000]  9.
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:18.000]  What comes next?
[03:50:18.000 --> 03:50:19.000]  10.
[03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  It's the same thing.
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:21.000]  We're like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:22.000]  What comes next?
[03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:23.000]  I mean, we know what they're doing.
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:24.000]  It's like making pancakes.
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  You get the pancake mix out, get the milk, get the eggs, start whipping it up.
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:32.000]  I mean, you know how to make pancakes.
[03:50:32.000 --> 03:50:39.000]  I mean, they've got the pancake mix, the eggs, the milk out on the counter, and a blender.
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:41.000]  I mean, what are they doing here?
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  I mean, they're saying you don't like healthcare.
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:44.000]  You're a Nazi.
[03:50:44.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  They're framing you.
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:46.000]  They're false flagging you.
[03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:50.000]  I mean, they're not just going to events dressed up like Nazis to discredit us.
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:51.000]  They're going to blow stuff up.
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:52.000]  You can be guaranteed.
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:55.000]  So again, get the word out to everyone.
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:56.000]  They're getting ready to pull the trigger.
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:50:57.000]  Okay?
[03:50:57.000 --> 03:50:58.000]  We're going to beat the drum.
[03:50:58.000 --> 03:50:59.000]  Warning you.
[03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:00.000]  We'll come back with Waco.
[03:51:00.000 --> 03:51:03.000]  On the other side, stay with us.
[03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:05.000]  Remain in your houses.
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:11.000]  The president of the United States has declared martial law under executive order 11,004.
[03:51:11.000 --> 03:51:12.000]  Will they do it?
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:15.000]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:21.000]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:23.000]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:28.000]  Executive order 10,990 locks down all highways.
[03:51:28.000 --> 03:51:33.000]  Executive order 10,995 ceases control of all media outlets.
[03:51:33.000 --> 03:51:38.000]  Executive order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:48.000]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions

[03:52:07.000 --> 03:52:11.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:13.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:19.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:19.000 --> 03:52:26.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:36.000]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:40.000]  Repair to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:46.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:46.000 --> 03:52:50.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:52.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:52.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  It's here.

[03:53:57.000 --> 03:54:18.000]  All right, final segment of the radio broadcast.
[03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:27.000]  It came out in the congressional hearings on Waco that Clinton was personally running it, he wanted to demonize the patriot movement,
[03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:31.000]  kind of kick off a domestic purge against the American people.
[03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:39.000]  And other sources have reported that Janet Reno had blackmailed, because this isn't the first time we've heard this,
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:43.000]  had blackmailed Clinton when he wasn't going to reappoint her, she was so unpopular,
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:50.000]  that she would quote, tell the truth about Waco, that special forces troops went in, placed a bomb on top of the church records area,
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:54:54.000]  the concrete area, killed the kids inside, shot people when they were exiting.
[03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:57.000]  We have the flare footage from the army of them doing it and they said,
[03:54:57.000 --> 03:55:02.000]  oh, those flashes on the end of troops' guns, that's not what you think it is.
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:04.000]  On and on and on.
[03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:08.000]  Now, this is very complex what Dick Morris did.
[03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:14.000]  He was saying, be careful, Clinton, saying that conservatives are going to be responsible for another Oklahoma City.
[03:55:14.000 --> 03:55:16.000]  Be careful.
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:20.000]  And then he says, I don't know what it was Reno was threatening him with.
[03:55:20.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  Of course, that's not true.
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  We all know it came out here and there.
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  He put it together very clear.
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:32.000]  He's not going as far as limbo or savage saying the government will stage terror attacks and blame it on us.
[03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:33.000]  Oklahoma City too.
[03:55:33.000 --> 03:55:39.000]  So again, I'm not the only one saying this now, anybody who's smart can see it or even common sense, not even smart anymore.
[03:55:39.000 --> 03:55:42.000]  Dick Morris is saying, watch it, buddy.
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:43.000]  Watch it.
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:45.000]  Don't try to blame something on us.
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:49.000]  And then he throws out a little secret that Bill Clinton told him.
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:51.000]  Remember, he was his chief advisor.
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:56:00.000]  He was the Carl Rove to Clinton that Janet Reno was blackmailing him.
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:06.000]  This is with Sean Hannity last night. Here it is.
[03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  And let's understand what was Timothy McVeigh's motivation.
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:21.000]  God knows what went on in that crazy head of his, but there is some speculation that then he himself had said that it was the reaction to the Waco takeover.
[03:56:21.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  And Bill Clinton orchestrated that takeover.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:33.000]  And in fact, was so ashamed about what he did in Waco that he was not going to appoint Janet Reno to a second four year term.
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:41.000]  And she told him in a meeting right before the inauguration day for his new term that if you don't appoint me, I'm going to tell the truth about Waco.
[03:56:41.000 --> 03:56:45.000]  And that forced Clinton's hand in reappointing her.
[03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:49.000]  So I don't remember you telling the story, but no, it's never been said before.
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:57:02.000]  I think that President Clinton might want to examine his own connection with the Oklahoma City bombing in terms of Waco before he starts accusing people and walkers and wheelchairs who are trying to keep their Medicare from being provocateurs.
[03:57:02.000 --> 03:57:06.000]  So what was the truth about Waco that Reno threatened to use against him?
[03:57:06.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  I have no idea, but I know that he told me, Clinton told me, that I couldn't not appoint Reno because she would have turned on me over Waco. That's the phrase he used.
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:25.000]  That's incredible. That's incredible. So what's happening here is anyone with a political brain knows they're getting ready to stage terror attacks. Clinton too, Obama.
[03:57:25.000 --> 03:57:31.000]  And here's Dick Morris saying, Clinton better watch it with his connection to Oklahoma City.
[03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  And then he goes, he does the tell. He's telling Hannity, there's a lot more Hannity.
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:42.000]  Man, I tell you, he's got to watch it. I mean, Dick Morris better come public now before they blow his airplane up or something.
[03:57:42.000 --> 03:57:51.000]  I mean, that was incredible. What you just saw, because you've got them getting out of the Bradley vehicles, firing their machine guns, you've got them detonating a bomb inside.
[03:57:51.000 --> 03:57:55.000]  And it came out the Delta Force was quote, pulling triggers on the ground.
[03:57:55.000 --> 03:58:01.000]  Lawn Horiuchi was there again of Ruby Ridge fame. This is just off the charts.
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:06.000]  So this is real brinksmanship that you're seeing.
[03:58:06.000 --> 03:58:13.000]  If we don't get the word out that the government elements of it are getting ready to stage terror attacks, they're going to do it and use it to get away with this full takeover.
[03:58:13.000 --> 03:58:18.000]  So it's a life and death situation. They want to sick homeland security on the American people.
[03:58:18.000 --> 03:58:24.000]  They want to go to a full bore oppressive society as bad as Nazi Germany.
[03:58:24.000 --> 03:58:27.000]  I mean, they really have decided to do it. They're going for broke.
[03:58:27.000 --> 03:58:30.000]  At the end of the show, I want to say we've added four new specials.
[03:58:30.000 --> 03:58:41.000]  You can get free terror storm, one of my best films. When you get Jesse Ventura's new book, we've got several new books up on the website like JFK and the secret team.
[03:58:41.000 --> 03:59:01.000]  God bless you all.
