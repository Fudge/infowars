[00:00.000 --> 00:17.200]  It's called the great reset, tough guy.
[00:17.200 --> 00:18.320]  It's called the new world order.
[00:18.320 --> 00:22.680]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can
[00:22.680 --> 00:27.560]  loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal
[00:27.560 --> 00:28.560]  basic income.
[00:28.560 --> 00:29.560]  That's everything.
[00:29.560 --> 00:31.760]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[00:31.760 --> 00:36.600]  The whole world is going to be about surveillance and control and then manipulating and tracking
[00:36.600 --> 00:37.600]  everything you do.
[00:37.600 --> 00:38.600]  It's all being officially announced.
[00:38.600 --> 00:40.120]  We've got articles everywhere.
[00:40.120 --> 00:42.120]  Their press releases saying...
[00:42.120 --> 00:48.240]  And then the crew asks me during the break they go, are you all right?
[00:48.240 --> 00:49.240]  You really seem upset.
[00:49.240 --> 00:50.240]  Are you all right?
[00:50.240 --> 00:51.240]  Are you all right?
[00:51.240 --> 00:52.240]  Are you all right?
[00:52.240 --> 00:53.240]  Are you all right?
[00:53.240 --> 00:54.240]  Are you all right?
[00:54.240 --> 00:55.240]  Are you all right?
[00:55.240 --> 00:56.240]  Are you all right?
[00:56.240 --> 00:57.240]  Are you all right?
[00:57.240 --> 00:58.240]  Are you all right?
[00:58.240 --> 00:59.240]  Are you all right?
[00:59.240 --> 01:00.240]  Are you all right?
[01:00.240 --> 01:01.240]  Are you all right?
[01:01.240 --> 01:02.240]  Are you all right?
[01:02.240 --> 01:03.240]  Are you all right?
[01:03.240 --> 01:04.240]  Are you all right?
[01:04.240 --> 01:05.240]  Are you all right?
[01:05.240 --> 01:06.240]  Are you all right?
[01:06.240 --> 01:07.240]  Are you all right?
[01:07.240 --> 01:08.240]  Are you all right?
[01:08.240 --> 01:09.240]  Are you all right?
[01:09.240 --> 01:10.240]  Are you all right?
[01:10.240 --> 01:11.240]  Are you all right?
[01:11.240 --> 01:12.240]  Are you all right?
[01:12.240 --> 01:13.240]  Are you all right?
[01:13.240 --> 01:14.240]  Are you all right?
[01:14.240 --> 01:15.240]  There are millions of other Shiva degrees of access to all theseetees.
[01:15.240 --> 01:16.240]  Are you all right?
[01:16.240 --> 01:17.240]  Are you guys is.
[01:17.240 --> 01:18.240]  Are you all right?
[01:18.240 --> 01:20.420] speaking alien
[01:20.420 --> 01:21.740] ります
[01:21.740 --> 01:23.060]  history
[01:23.060 --> 01:25.500]  secret
[01:25.500 --> 01:30.500]  And that paralyzes God.
[01:30.500 --> 01:32.500]  Yeah, God can do it.
[01:32.500 --> 01:35.500]  But God needs us to do it, because God's about free will.
[01:35.500 --> 01:41.500]  Once again, not for the first time what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be the truth.
[01:41.500 --> 01:43.500]  Yeah, I'm upset. I'm really...
[01:43.500 --> 01:45.500]  Last night, I said, what's wrong with you?
[01:45.500 --> 01:46.500]  You're really freaked out.
[01:46.500 --> 01:48.500]  I'm like, yeah, I'm really freaked out.
[01:48.500 --> 01:50.500]  I'm really freaked out.
[01:50.500 --> 01:53.500]  I'm really freaked out, you see, because this is real.
[01:53.500 --> 01:57.500]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off, is real.
[02:00.500 --> 02:03.500]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air.
[02:03.500 --> 02:07.500]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalist,
[02:07.500 --> 02:13.500]  I mean, we won't be here in six months. You won't be here in six months.
[02:13.500 --> 02:24.500]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[02:24.500 --> 02:26.500]  Infowars.com
[02:26.500 --> 02:27.500]  Infowars comes to mind.
[02:27.500 --> 02:28.500]  Infowars.com
[02:28.500 --> 02:29.500]  Infowars.
[02:29.500 --> 02:30.500]  You watch Infowars?
[02:30.500 --> 02:31.500]  Infowars.
[02:31.500 --> 02:33.500]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[02:33.500 --> 02:35.500]  Alex Jones, nice guy.
[02:35.500 --> 02:37.500]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[02:37.500 --> 02:38.500]  Alex Jones.
[02:38.500 --> 02:39.500]  Alex Jones.
[02:39.500 --> 02:40.500]  Alex Jones.
[02:40.500 --> 02:41.500]  Alex Jones.
[02:41.500 --> 02:42.500]  Alex Jones.
[02:42.500 --> 02:43.500]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[02:43.500 --> 02:44.500]  He knows who Infowars is.
[02:44.500 --> 02:45.500]  Thank you.
[02:45.500 --> 02:46.500]  Playing this joke over here.
[02:46.500 --> 02:47.500]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[02:47.500 --> 02:50.500]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:50.500 --> 02:53.500]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:53.500 --> 03:13.500]  We now are live inside the Infowars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[03:13.500 --> 03:15.500]  Oh, and Troy are sitting in here.
[03:15.500 --> 03:22.500]  We are going to be hearing from Alex throughout the entirety of the first hour with all kinds
[03:22.500 --> 03:29.500]  of breaking news reports and responses to the news, which is just absolutely insane today.
[03:29.500 --> 03:33.500]  It seems to get more insane as the days go on.
[03:33.500 --> 03:38.500]  But we do get a clear picture of what we're up against.
[03:38.500 --> 03:47.500]  We do get a clear picture of what the global elite globalists, shadow government, Illuminati,
[03:47.500 --> 03:52.500]  New World Order is up to.
[03:52.500 --> 03:57.500]  If you could boil it down and say, what is it all about?
[03:57.500 --> 04:01.940]  What is the real agenda?
[04:01.940 --> 04:08.980]  What is all this madness from the drag queen story time to the men and women to the censorship
[04:08.980 --> 04:13.100]  to all of it?
[04:13.100 --> 04:22.300]  It's all about a New World Order where you're indoctrinated and trained to believe from
[04:22.300 --> 04:28.020]  the day you're born until the day you die that you don't belong here.
[04:28.020 --> 04:29.020]  You're a parasite.
[04:29.020 --> 04:30.700]  You're a termite.
[04:30.700 --> 04:35.820]  And you're essentially eating this planet, which is going to be claimed for the globalist
[04:35.820 --> 04:39.700]  and the World Economic Forum and the Klaus Schwab and the Bill Gates of the world.
[04:39.700 --> 04:47.100]  Your, your, your privilege is even being alive on Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates Planet.
[04:47.100 --> 04:48.300]  But you're going to live in a pod.
[04:48.300 --> 04:53.540]  You're going to eat the bugs and you're going to be treated like a indentured servant slave
[04:53.540 --> 05:01.180]  peasant because you're killing the planet.
[05:01.180 --> 05:09.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[05:09.180 --> 05:15.020]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[05:15.020 --> 05:20.940]  are broken down and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[05:20.940 --> 05:21.940]  operations.
[05:21.940 --> 05:26.140]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making their main
[05:26.140 --> 05:27.140]  move.
[05:27.140 --> 05:31.660]  In full wars, it's paradoxical is more popular than ever is reaching more people than ever
[05:31.660 --> 05:33.180]  despite the censorship.
[05:33.180 --> 05:36.700]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for
[05:36.700 --> 05:40.580]  our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money.
[05:40.580 --> 05:47.340]  So listen up to 75% off infowarstore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts to help
[05:47.340 --> 05:52.900]  spread the word and fund the operation on supplements, on books, on films.
[05:52.900 --> 05:59.060]  Everything is 25 to 75% off right now, the biggest sell in our history at infowarstore.com.
[05:59.060 --> 06:26.180]  Take it for your support.
[06:26.180 --> 06:33.620]  The Pentagon has been extremely clear, Russia's defense ministry has been crystal clear, but
[06:33.620 --> 06:40.340]  many voices on the left and the neocon right in the United States, in the UK and Europe
[06:40.340 --> 06:50.780]  are all calling for a no fly zone to be enforced by NATO, which would bring NATO officially
[06:50.780 --> 06:54.020]  into war with Russia.
[06:54.020 --> 06:59.620]  Now, NATO has already had troops there, there's already been a proxy war going on for at least
[06:59.620 --> 07:02.540]  eight years, that's on record, the CIA has bragged.
[07:02.540 --> 07:09.660]  And Russia has said that if any type of no fly zone is established that they will start
[07:09.660 --> 07:14.820]  shooting those aircraft down, then when NATO aircraft gets shot down, you know, the rest
[07:14.820 --> 07:20.100]  of the story, things will escalate there to tactical nuclear weapons and then a wider
[07:20.100 --> 07:24.860]  nuclear war, and that's not good for anybody.
[07:24.860 --> 07:30.420]  There's a big story on infowarstore.com that links to mainstream news reports in Europe,
[07:30.420 --> 07:34.060]  and we've seen a lot of evidence that Poland is indeed pushing for this, and it's already
[07:34.060 --> 07:41.580]  called to ship their MiGs into Ukraine, and then to have the US backfill and replace those.
[07:41.580 --> 07:47.660]  Well now this, secret plan to send 10,000 NATO peacekeeping troops into Ukraine, oh
[07:47.660 --> 07:53.260]  they're peacekeeping, so when they give military aid if Russia strikes them, Russia has struck
[07:53.260 --> 07:58.700]  peacekeepers, and now it's their fault World War III starts according to the UN.
[07:58.700 --> 08:04.060]  A secret plan for a peacekeeping mission involving 10,000 NATO troops from different countries
[08:04.060 --> 08:08.660]  entering Ukraine and imposing a limited no fly zone is allegedly being prepared by the
[08:08.660 --> 08:10.140]  Polish government.
[08:10.140 --> 08:18.060]  Polish news outlet ONET or ONET reports that the president of Poland is wanting and waiting
[08:18.060 --> 08:23.820]  on a green light from the White House before implementing the proposal.
[08:23.820 --> 08:29.180]  Created by the Polish Ministry of Defense, the plan would see 10,000 NATO troops form
[08:29.180 --> 08:34.540]  of an international contingent sent to Ukraine to protect humanitarian corridors, and you
[08:34.540 --> 08:38.980]  know the State Department and the CIA and NATO are all there training these troops right
[08:38.980 --> 08:42.860]  now it's been going on, even before the Russians invaded.
[08:42.860 --> 08:45.860]  And they would quote enforce a no fly zone over them.
[08:45.860 --> 08:51.700]  It means setting up military units at a distance from the frontiers that would be tasked with
[08:51.700 --> 08:56.180]  defending humanitarian convoys with food and medicine, and of course weapons are chipping
[08:56.180 --> 09:01.900]  in, and the ones allowing civilians to escape danger, so they're opening up weapons corridors
[09:01.900 --> 09:06.460]  because the Russians have started bombing those corridors coming out of Poland and stopping
[09:06.460 --> 09:07.460]  those shipments.
[09:07.460 --> 09:11.460]  So now they're going to put Western troops in, so oh you can't bomb these, you're killing
[09:11.460 --> 09:12.460]  Western troops.
[09:12.460 --> 09:16.940]  So they're sending the troops in as targets as decoys as a pretext for a wider war.
[09:16.940 --> 09:21.500]  According to Remix News, one of the scenarios includes implementing a no fly zone over the
[09:21.500 --> 09:27.700]  largest cities in Ukraine, which would mark a serious escalation and likely direct conflict
[09:27.700 --> 09:29.260]  with Russia.
[09:29.260 --> 09:33.740]  The plan is seemingly on hiatus because of a disagreement between President Duba and
[09:33.740 --> 09:38.980]  the Ministry of Defense with law and justice leadership because the president of Poland
[09:38.980 --> 09:42.340]  wants Washington's approval before going ahead.
[09:42.340 --> 09:45.820]  According to the report, the White House will consider the plans before Thursday's NATO
[09:45.820 --> 09:50.340]  summit in Brussels before a decision can be made.
[09:50.340 --> 09:54.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, pray for a global awakening and pray for peace.
[09:54.100 --> 10:00.540]  This is such an incredibly dangerous development that we're all witnessing, and it's a proxy
[10:00.540 --> 10:06.780]  war the globalists want to cover up the end of dollar hegemony, the end of the EU's currency,
[10:06.780 --> 10:08.060]  the end of the Chinese currency.
[10:08.060 --> 10:12.420]  There's been a race to the bottom of devaluing all these currencies.
[10:12.420 --> 10:16.780]  It's causing major inflation around the world, major starvation around the world, and now
[10:16.780 --> 10:21.460]  they're blaming it all on the conflict that is just a repeat of basically what happened
[10:21.460 --> 10:24.660]  in World War II along the original battle lines.
[10:24.660 --> 10:30.380]  So this is the detonator and the smoke screen for this fourth turning or this new world
[10:30.380 --> 10:33.740]  order that Biden has been talking about.
[10:33.740 --> 10:39.820]  So please, whether you're a Christian or whether you're a Jew or a Muslim or an agnostic or
[10:39.820 --> 10:44.820]  a Buddhist or black or white or older young, you need to learn the geopolitical facts.
[10:44.820 --> 10:49.540]  I know a lot of you already know these facts, but others need to know these facts and understand
[10:49.540 --> 10:55.700]  we are waltzing into Armageddon.
[10:55.700 --> 11:03.300]  Now at this point in closing, as Owen takes over here today, and it's this.
[11:03.300 --> 11:06.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists believe they can survive a nuclear war.
[11:06.100 --> 11:10.340]  They've got all these private and corporate and governmental underground bunkers and facilities.
[11:10.340 --> 11:12.260]  They've committed massive crimes.
[11:12.260 --> 11:17.380]  They're all going to go to prison for the fractional reserve banking and the derivatives
[11:17.380 --> 11:22.420]  and selling mortgages 50, 60, 100 times a piece and all the incredible crimes.
[11:22.420 --> 11:29.420]  And so they really have positioned an economic collapse by design and war as the pretext
[11:29.420 --> 11:34.660]  for them to come out on top and depopulate the earth, which they believe is overpopulated.
[11:34.660 --> 11:42.140]  So it is critical for anybody out there that wants to not be in a total depression or worse
[11:42.140 --> 11:46.580]  to not choose a side in this and to realize the globalists are playing the different sides
[11:46.580 --> 11:48.260]  off against each other.
[11:48.260 --> 11:52.820]  And it's also critical for everyone to realize that the globalists can't succeed if people
[11:52.820 --> 11:54.180]  are aware of what's going on.
[11:54.180 --> 11:58.020]  Again, the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[11:58.020 --> 12:02.380]  So spread the live feed of this show from M4Wars.com, a band of video.
[12:02.380 --> 12:07.260]  Tell folks about that local MNFM station you're listening to and go to M4Wars.com.
[12:07.260 --> 12:13.620]  We're having a up to 75% off mega blowout sale on T-shirts, books, films, supplements,
[12:13.620 --> 12:14.620]  everything.
[12:14.620 --> 12:18.820]  The world's so dangerous, I'm getting all the funds in we can right now with the supply
[12:18.820 --> 12:23.340]  chain breakdowns so we can operate even give the supply chain completely breakdown for
[12:23.340 --> 12:24.780]  as long as possible.
[12:24.780 --> 12:28.780]  So this is a very serious time to get ready and dig in, get yourselves ready to care your
[12:28.780 --> 12:36.020]  family but also prioritize keeping key sentinels of truth like M4Wars on the air that are critical
[12:36.020 --> 12:40.220]  towards the future of the American way of life and our Christian society.
[12:40.220 --> 12:42.100]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[12:42.100 --> 12:46.540]  Please visit M4Wars.com now and check out some products that have been sold out that
[12:46.540 --> 12:53.020]  are back in stock like Biotrycellinium, double fizzy magnesium drink and of course our great

[13:01.460 --> 13:05.020]  but whatever you do, pray for a global awakening and pray for peace.
[13:05.020 --> 13:13.580]  And we've got more reports that have been filed by Alex that we're going to go to later
[13:13.580 --> 13:21.980]  on in this first hour of the Alex Jones show and let me just quickly kind of lay into the
[13:21.980 --> 13:23.500]  stack that I have.
[13:23.500 --> 13:28.860]  We're going to have updates on the nomination process of Judge Jackson folks.
[13:28.860 --> 13:35.620]  This is really an interesting one, it's kind of not been the main story.
[13:35.620 --> 13:43.260]  The one aspect of the nomination process that has kind of gone mainstream I guess you could
[13:43.260 --> 13:49.940]  say or most people following this know about now is Judge Jackson's clear judicial record
[13:49.940 --> 13:58.260]  of protecting pedophiles but there's some other rifts and things happening in that confirmation
[13:58.260 --> 14:01.220]  hearing that we will discuss.
[14:01.220 --> 14:10.860]  You know I've, it's really a matter of being in tune with reality and being smart and informed
[14:10.860 --> 14:19.220]  and having any form of intellect at all to understand that America is in a very dangerous
[14:19.220 --> 14:27.380]  downward spiral right now economically, culturally and if it continues like this you're basically
[14:27.380 --> 14:32.900]  going to have a new modern day 21st century Great Depression.
[14:32.900 --> 14:39.420]  But the idea is to have a worldwide Great Depression that the World Economic Forum and
[14:39.420 --> 14:44.420]  the Davos Group and the UN and everybody else, all the world elites, all the globalists
[14:44.420 --> 14:50.060]  mop up essentially conquering the planet and then oh if you survive this you're just going
[14:50.060 --> 14:53.660]  to be lucky enough to live on Bill Gates planet, you're going to be lucky enough to live on
[14:53.660 --> 14:57.220]  Klaus Schwab spaceship, that's how they're going to sell it, like they own the planet,
[14:57.220 --> 15:01.380]  you're fortunate enough to even live on their planet, they have the right to just kill you
[15:01.380 --> 15:08.420]  if they so deem necessary whether it's with a secret lethal injection or a biological
[15:08.420 --> 15:14.260]  weapon or hell they'll just mop you up and disappear you.
[15:14.260 --> 15:19.060]  And they're bragging about now, it's just so overwhelming folks, I mean I've got news
[15:19.060 --> 15:24.180]  here, I mean the crime rates in the US, I mean what we're seeing in inner cities, I mean
[15:24.180 --> 15:31.580]  this is disgusting, do you realize that a group of teens beat an elderly woman to death
[15:31.580 --> 15:37.060]  on camera and they've been and they've had their charges dropped?
[15:37.060 --> 15:42.300]  But Joe Biggs today just got sentenced to 30 days in solitary confinement as he goes
[15:42.300 --> 15:54.180]  a year in prison for walking into the Capitol, so I've got that and so much more, we just
[15:54.180 --> 15:59.420]  got to pray, just pray for God's forgiveness and intervention folks.
[15:59.420 --> 16:03.940]  You know it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars
[16:03.940 --> 16:11.980]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[16:11.980 --> 16:19.740]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is really right now
[16:19.740 --> 16:25.580]  hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done, so I'm asking listeners now
[16:25.580 --> 16:30.860]  to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at info wars store.com and we are
[16:30.860 --> 16:36.460]  funded by listeners and viewers like you and so now we need to support more than ever
[16:36.460 --> 16:41.860]  because this fight has intensified, don't need me to tell you that at info wars store.com.
[16:41.860 --> 16:47.020]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now, things have been sold out for a long

[16:59.060 --> 17:00.060]  now.
[17:00.060 --> 17:05.420]  The genesis over 100 years ago were very public about their plans, they financed major universities,
[17:05.420 --> 17:11.220]  they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of the New York Times,
[17:11.220 --> 17:16.660]  other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended
[17:16.660 --> 17:22.260]  and the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[17:22.260 --> 17:26.860]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing and
[17:26.860 --> 17:31.220]  I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter,
[17:31.220 --> 17:35.220]  my wife makes dinner a lot of times but I like to make it as well, I love to make breakfast
[17:35.220 --> 17:40.220]  and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative
[17:40.220 --> 17:45.220]  and then all sit down together and have the communal event and that's what the system
[17:45.220 --> 17:50.660]  is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions that come in together,
[17:50.660 --> 17:57.060]  they really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn
[17:57.060 --> 18:01.380]  us into lab rats, we cannot let this continue.
[18:01.380 --> 18:06.820]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient dense ingredients, VasoBeat will be your new
[18:06.820 --> 18:11.140]  favorite info wars life formula.
[18:11.140 --> 18:16.340]  Using only water and beetroot, VasoBeat is the most concentrated liquid extract to feed

[18:24.540 --> 18:29.740]  and antioxidants you want to help support a healthy liver, athletic performance, blood
[18:29.740 --> 18:32.740]  vessels and more.
[18:32.740 --> 18:39.660]  Don't overlook the power of beetroot, get your naturally occurring potassium, folate,
[18:39.660 --> 18:48.380]  vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K and more.
[18:48.380 --> 19:17.380]  One of nature's greatest treasures in VasoBeat from info wars life today.

[19:26.460 --> 19:34.780]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporation that
[19:34.780 --> 19:42.180]  way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies that only
[19:42.180 --> 19:51.460]  I own profitable, you will then be my slaves, oh and then you get that special shot of freedom
[19:51.460 --> 19:56.860]  from copra, it will improve your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest
[19:56.860 --> 20:00.860]  of your miserable lives.
[20:00.860 --> 20:18.340]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.340 --> 20:28.540]  You know I sit here getting ready to come on air to do this segment and I'm thinking
[20:28.540 --> 20:36.540]  what's the biggest news story, what do you start the segment with, where do you start
[20:36.540 --> 20:48.140]  the momentum here and is it groups of teens, youths, you're not allowed to say, the left
[20:48.140 --> 20:51.940]  loves talking about skin color, I don't but do I want to talk about skin color, not really
[20:51.940 --> 20:56.460]  I don't want to play these racist bigoted games like the left plays but see if it's
[20:56.460 --> 21:01.740]  a group of black kids it's teens.
[21:01.740 --> 21:07.220]  So do I sit here and do a highlight all the crime that's going on where now, you know
[21:07.220 --> 21:13.460]  spring break in Florida, really popular thing, really a big thing in the 90s, they used to
[21:13.460 --> 21:18.620]  do TV specials and everybody would go down there and it was a great time, I went down
[21:18.620 --> 21:26.180]  there when I was in high school but now spring break in Florida ain't the same thing is it
[21:26.180 --> 21:33.740]  shootings happening, Miami declaring a state of emergency, curfews declared, I've got multiple
[21:33.740 --> 21:40.620]  videos today of the mass crime spree continuing, retail theft, broad daylight it happens now
[21:40.620 --> 21:48.940]  and then if you try to stop it, you try to stop a thief from going into a CVS or a jewelry
[21:48.940 --> 21:57.100]  store, you get charged with a crime but if you're four teens that kill a 73 year old
[21:57.100 --> 22:06.060]  grandmother, you get your charges dropped, what?
[22:06.060 --> 22:10.180]  Or maybe it's the vaccines killing people or maybe it's the vaccines not working, maybe
[22:10.180 --> 22:15.540]  it's Pfizer admitting that their products cause cancer, maybe it's the liberal out of
[22:15.540 --> 22:21.460]  control left admitting that they're just bringing in communism, it doesn't matter, you didn't
[22:21.460 --> 22:24.860]  vote for it, they're going to have a work around through the securities and exchange
[22:24.860 --> 22:30.260]  commission, maybe it's that, maybe it's the new Biden nominee for the Supreme Court that
[22:30.260 --> 22:35.020]  protects pedophiles and that's just part of the corruption we're learning about this
[22:35.020 --> 22:39.540]  woman and this process that she's been involved in, maybe it's the Hunter Biden laptop story
[22:39.540 --> 22:44.820]  that got buried that now we know is confirmed and we see it's even a worse situation with
[22:44.820 --> 22:49.380]  Bill Barr, Bill Barr was telling Trump to leave the Hunter Biden laptop alone, oh really
[22:49.380 --> 22:56.460]  Bill Barr, boy oh boy did that guy turn out to be a scumbag, maybe it's the left lying
[22:56.460 --> 23:01.180]  about things like don't say gay bill that doesn't even exist and then having men competing
[23:01.180 --> 23:05.820]  as women because this is fifth wave feminism now folks, we've gone full circle, men are
[23:05.820 --> 23:15.540]  now women or maybe it's how the situation in Ukraine, see it's not even really, for
[23:15.540 --> 23:20.260]  the people in Ukraine it's sad, for the people dealing with that it is in their front yard,
[23:20.260 --> 23:25.100]  their backyard but for the planet, for the rest of the world it's the threat of a World
[23:25.100 --> 23:33.700]  War III type situation and I think Putin and his cronies are serious and when you hear
[23:33.700 --> 23:40.260]  their latest comments you realize they're serious but oh as the world economy collapses
[23:40.260 --> 23:45.300]  Putin and Russia is the perfect scapegoat for all the globalist criminals with their
[23:45.300 --> 23:50.900]  stolen loot to blame but that's what I'm saying is okay I've got stacks of all these different
[23:50.900 --> 23:56.300]  news stories that I'll bear into and we'll explain and we'll get in but the big news
[23:56.300 --> 24:07.780]  story is how it's all connected, that's the big story, all the different sections are
[24:07.780 --> 24:18.220]  all connected, it's the great reset, it's the new world order and the best way to describe
[24:18.220 --> 24:28.300]  it to a lay person is just to say this, you're not going to be a free citizen anymore, America
[24:28.300 --> 24:35.180]  as you know it is not going to exist anymore and life as we know it on planet earth is
[24:35.180 --> 24:40.980]  soon to be a thing of the past and it's not going to be a oh remember the good old days
[24:40.980 --> 24:47.180]  where slowly generationally things change and maybe life gets a little different and
[24:47.180 --> 24:52.900]  you see weirdness and all this stuff, no it's going to be just a full on reset where you're
[24:52.900 --> 25:00.220]  not reminiscing on the good old days, you're a slave in the new world order and see that's
[25:00.220 --> 25:06.020]  part of the propaganda with bringing up slavery in the west and just associating slavery with
[25:06.020 --> 25:14.940]  black people in the west when slavery has been an ancient human tradition sadly for
[25:14.940 --> 25:19.900]  thousands of years, white people enslaved, brown people enslaved, black people enslaved
[25:19.900 --> 25:25.600]  and it was America that changed the world by ending slavery but see oh America ends
[25:25.600 --> 25:32.820]  slavery so then it somehow becomes the bastion of being blamed for all slavery, I see but
[25:32.820 --> 25:40.340]  see that's all a distraction because you're going into a slave system now and it's going
[25:40.340 --> 25:47.020]  to be the great reset and then your social credit score so that's the big story so I
[25:47.020 --> 25:51.420]  mean I'm going to go in and cover all this news but that's what people need to understand
[25:51.420 --> 26:00.860]  that's the larger picture that's the real story all of this is by design and some countries
[26:00.860 --> 26:06.300]  and some leaders have decided they don't want to go into it and that's going to be the big
[26:06.300 --> 26:10.740]  problem for the globalists, I don't think Saudi Arabia wants to go into the new world
[26:10.740 --> 26:14.420]  order, I don't think the UAE wants to go into the new world order, Russia doesn't want to
[26:14.420 --> 26:19.180]  go into the new world order, Brazil doesn't want to go into the new world order, Mexico
[26:19.180 --> 26:26.220]  doesn't want to go into the new world order, but see America is kind of the centerpiece
[26:26.220 --> 26:32.220]  here, if America goes into the new world order then that all the momentum into the great
[26:32.220 --> 26:36.820]  reset stems from there where if you have Trump in office or somebody that doesn't want to
[26:36.820 --> 26:41.060]  go into the new world order all of a sudden this obstacle of the great reset called the
[26:41.060 --> 26:47.780]  free people of America and the American economy is an obstacle that the great reset can't
[26:47.780 --> 26:53.300]  just pass over easily, they'll have to physically conquer us at that point, another biological
[26:53.300 --> 26:58.140]  weapon release, more people dying from the vaccines, hitting your kids with gay bombs
[26:58.140 --> 27:03.980]  in the schools, just everything that you're seeing, it's all about demoralizing the United
[27:03.980 --> 27:09.620]  States, destroying the United States so that they can then be mopped up in a new great
[27:09.620 --> 27:13.860]  depression into the new world order.
[27:13.860 --> 27:25.980]  Now, folks, the hearings and that's the problem is really we should probably all be focused
[27:25.980 --> 27:33.500]  on these hearings right now for Judge Jackson because this is going to have long term implications
[27:33.500 --> 27:38.440]  for our country and I would say it's, you know, it's probably 98% chance this pedophile
[27:38.440 --> 27:44.620]  protector gets nominated to the Supreme Court, folks, this woman is so dumb.
[27:44.620 --> 27:49.300]  I mean she can't even answer basic questions like can you define a woman?
[27:49.300 --> 27:54.540]  I'm not even kidding you, we've got the video clips, it's all coming up.
[27:54.540 --> 27:58.900]  In fact, I'll play it right now, I mean, look at how bad, look at how much of an embarrassment
[27:58.900 --> 28:03.300]  Kamala Harris is where Newt Gingrich goes on Fox News and says she's the dumbest woman
[28:03.300 --> 28:06.580]  ever put into office, I think he's right.
[28:06.580 --> 28:13.580]  So think about Kamala Harris, the token black person for the Democrats, now Judge Jackson,
[28:13.580 --> 28:19.540]  the new token black person for the Democrats, how's this going with the liberal tokenism?
[28:19.540 --> 28:23.740]  How's it going with Kamala Harris, not so good or almost her entire staff has quit?
[28:23.740 --> 28:26.980]  This is what you're going to get from your new token black Supreme Court justice from
[28:26.980 --> 28:28.580]  the Democrats.
[28:28.580 --> 28:33.820]  Here's just a small sample size in clip one.
[28:33.820 --> 28:38.940]  Can you provide a definition for the word woman?
[28:38.940 --> 28:40.940]  Can I provide a definition?
[28:40.940 --> 28:41.940]  No.
[28:41.940 --> 28:42.940]  Yeah.
[28:42.940 --> 28:43.940]  I can't.
[28:43.940 --> 28:47.020]  You can't?
[28:47.020 --> 28:51.860]  Not in this context, I'm not a biologist.
[28:51.860 --> 28:53.340]  Can't even tell you what a woman is, folks.
[28:53.340 --> 28:59.980]  That's how lost and gone the liberal left is.
[28:59.980 --> 29:08.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[29:08.860 --> 29:13.780]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[29:13.780 --> 29:19.540]  have broken down, and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying
[29:19.540 --> 29:24.580]  for operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making
[29:24.580 --> 29:25.580]  their main move.
[29:25.580 --> 29:29.780]  In full wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people
[29:29.780 --> 29:34.460]  than ever despite the censorship, but because of cost increasing and having to run our own
[29:34.460 --> 29:38.820]  infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of
[29:38.820 --> 29:39.820]  money.

[30:42.020 --> 30:44.340]  the spear, the info wars operation.
[30:44.340 --> 30:45.700]  It is a 360 win.
[30:45.700 --> 30:50.180]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[30:50.180 --> 30:52.780]  natural defenses and keep info wars on the air.
[30:52.780 --> 30:55.220]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[30:55.220 --> 30:57.220]  Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[30:57.220 --> 31:09.220]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[31:09.220 --> 31:15.780]  prince, that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[31:15.780 --> 31:16.780]  lost.
[31:16.780 --> 31:21.980]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you
[31:21.980 --> 31:30.260]  get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[31:30.260 --> 31:33.060]  You have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done.
[31:33.060 --> 31:34.060]  They have stunned us.
[31:34.060 --> 31:39.420]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently
[31:39.420 --> 31:43.460]  came out and gave a speech called The Great New Narrative where he brags how the public
[31:43.460 --> 31:48.340]  is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all
[31:48.340 --> 31:52.300]  alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[31:52.300 --> 31:53.820]  That's what the great reason is.
[31:53.820 --> 31:54.820]  They need darkness to thrive.
[31:54.820 --> 31:59.820]  The light lives at infowars.com.
[31:59.820 --> 32:05.260]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[32:05.260 --> 32:07.300]  a healthier life.
[32:07.300 --> 32:11.140]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[32:11.140 --> 32:12.780]  that contains both.
[32:12.780 --> 32:17.740]  This info wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[32:17.740 --> 32:19.340]  from the info wars store.
[32:19.340 --> 32:24.140]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[32:24.140 --> 32:26.860]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[32:26.860 --> 32:31.700]  Info chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[32:31.700 --> 32:36.420]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[32:36.420 --> 32:37.420]  shown.
[32:37.420 --> 32:41.700]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[32:41.700 --> 32:46.260]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[32:46.260 --> 32:51.380]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[32:51.380 --> 32:52.380]  like here in America.
[32:52.380 --> 32:57.420]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our
[32:57.420 --> 33:00.820]  rose hips don't lie.
[33:00.820 --> 33:16.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:16.100 --> 33:24.180]  Alex Jones responds to Biden nominee for the Supreme Court and pedophile protector Judge
[33:24.180 --> 33:27.300]  Jackson refusing to define what a woman is.
[33:27.300 --> 33:52.020]  Here is a report filed from Alex Jones.
[33:52.020 --> 33:57.140]  Can you provide a definition for the word woman?
[33:57.140 --> 34:01.980]  I can't.
[34:01.980 --> 34:05.140]  You can't?
[34:05.140 --> 34:09.420]  Not in this context, I'm not a biologist.
[34:09.420 --> 34:16.140]  Senator Blackburn asked Judge Jackson a very simple question.
[34:16.140 --> 34:18.140]  What is a woman?
[34:18.140 --> 34:23.260]  And anybody in a sixth grade biology class would tell you, well a woman has these type
[34:23.260 --> 34:29.100]  of chromosomes and a man has another type and a woman is the female of the mammalian
[34:29.100 --> 34:37.580]  species of Homo sapien and the male is the other side of a species.
[34:37.580 --> 34:44.260]  But no, the left is such a cult and the Tabistock Institute is in such control that the litmus
[34:44.260 --> 34:51.860]  test now for whether someone is in their cult or not is can they say a woman is a biological
[34:51.860 --> 34:54.940]  thing, a man is a biological thing.
[34:54.940 --> 34:58.940]  This is a direct attack on the biology of humans.
[34:58.940 --> 35:05.820]  When you're eradicating fire ants or eradicating a type of fish like carp that's an invasive
[35:05.820 --> 35:13.940]  species in areas of the U.S. or you're eradicating a mosquito, they introduce mosquitoes that
[35:13.940 --> 35:19.300]  basically have a sterilant built into them and it's the same thing with the carp, it's
[35:19.300 --> 35:21.580]  the same thing with the fire ants.
[35:21.580 --> 35:27.580]  When you are abating a species, you attack its reproductive system.
[35:27.580 --> 35:30.460]  Whether it's screw worms, the list goes on and on.
[35:30.460 --> 35:34.260]  And everything that's being done to us with the chemicals, the biologicals, all of it
[35:34.260 --> 35:41.700]  is about scrambling or interconsystems or hormonal systems and creating a hermaphroditic
[35:41.700 --> 35:42.700]  type species.
[35:42.700 --> 35:46.340]  That's why it's all in the 1931 book, Brave New World, written by Aldous Huxley, whose
[35:46.340 --> 35:52.180]  brother was the leading eugenicist, Julian Huxley, who headed up Unesco at the UN a few
[35:52.180 --> 35:53.180]  years later.
[35:53.180 --> 35:57.980]  Again, Huxley, when he gave a speech in 1961 at Berkeley about his book Brave New World
[35:57.980 --> 36:03.300]  Revisited, it's nonfiction, explained this is the real plan for the world.
[36:03.300 --> 36:08.460]  But let us visit another dystopian classic that was also a projection of the future of
[36:08.460 --> 36:14.140]  what George Arwell, who had been a top communist working at the highest levels of the Fabian
[36:14.140 --> 36:19.940]  Socialist and the OSS in 1984, projected of the future.
[36:19.940 --> 36:25.740]  He wrote essays before he died in 49, one year after the book came out, that he predicted
[36:25.740 --> 36:30.380]  the world would be like in 1984 if the communists were successful.
[36:30.380 --> 36:34.740]  He turned against them several years before he died famously when he found out how evil
[36:34.740 --> 36:35.740]  they were.
[36:35.740 --> 36:38.180]  And he said it said, boot stomping on the human face forever.
[36:38.180 --> 36:44.180]  But the key to 1984 was, as Winston's been tortured for several months, O'Brien the
[36:44.180 --> 36:49.020]  torturer says, I want you to give up your will and be completely mentally ill.
[36:49.020 --> 36:54.220]  And if I say 2 plus 2 equals 10, it equals 10, I say it equals 7 equals 7, if I say
[36:54.220 --> 36:59.020]  it equals 4 it equals 4, I want you to hold all these ideas in your head at one time where
[36:59.020 --> 37:02.220]  you are a programmable robot.
[37:02.220 --> 37:07.420]  And Winston says, freedom is the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4, and he said that's
[37:07.420 --> 37:10.780]  right, and I'm going to suck your soul.
[37:10.780 --> 37:15.260]  I'm a priest of power, I want to destroy men, and I will be destroyed as well.
[37:15.260 --> 37:20.820]  This is an attack on God, and I am going to annihilate your mind and then burn you up
[37:20.820 --> 37:25.580]  and inject your ashes into the atmosphere, and you will never be remembered again.
[37:25.580 --> 37:30.380]  So imagine we have this woman who we're supposed to vote for and support and confirm because
[37:30.380 --> 37:31.380]  she's black.
[37:31.380 --> 37:35.500]  Well, there were plenty of black judges that are constitutionalists and smart people, but
[37:35.500 --> 37:41.460]  no, no, no, she's there because she always gives under the minimum sentence to even child
[37:41.460 --> 37:47.180]  rapists and child pornographers, producers of child porn, people that actually rape children.
[37:47.180 --> 37:54.460]  She illegally, but nobody calls her on it, the Pills Courts know, is famous for protecting
[37:54.460 --> 37:55.460]  pedophiles.
[37:55.460 --> 38:01.660]  So of course, Joe, the creepy Joe Biden, the Crypt Keeper is supporting her.
[38:01.660 --> 38:03.660]  So let's hear that audio.
[38:03.660 --> 38:10.940]  Let's see that video one more time, where the Supreme Court nominee is telling the world
[38:10.940 --> 38:16.420]  she's not a biologist, so she can't tell you what a woman is.
[38:16.420 --> 38:21.740]  The ability to be free is to be able to say a man is a man, a woman is a woman.
[38:21.740 --> 38:27.180]  The ability to be free is to be able to say two plus two equals four.
[38:27.180 --> 38:32.300]  Can you provide a definition for the word woman?
[38:32.300 --> 38:33.900]  Can I provide a definition?
[38:33.900 --> 38:34.900]  No.
[38:34.900 --> 38:35.900]  Yeah.
[38:35.900 --> 38:37.140]  I can't.
[38:37.140 --> 38:40.300]  You can't?
[38:40.300 --> 38:41.980]  Not in this context.
[38:41.980 --> 38:44.260]  I'm not a biologist.
[38:44.260 --> 38:50.180]  What's happening here with these kangaroo judges, these kangaroo courts is very, very simple.
[38:50.180 --> 38:55.900]  They're given cult-like litmus tests to prove they will serve whatever absurdist system
[38:55.900 --> 39:01.340]  are miscarriage of justice, the corporate globalist establishment once, and George Soros
[39:01.340 --> 39:06.380]  that brags that he's overthrown dozens of governments and crashed pension funds and
[39:06.380 --> 39:08.740]  robbed old people around the world.
[39:08.740 --> 39:13.020]  Also brags that he's gotten over a thousand district attorneys and county attorneys elected
[39:13.020 --> 39:17.180]  in the last five years and is in control of almost every U.S. city.
[39:17.180 --> 39:24.620]  He's also got currently more than 20 sitting state attorney generals under his control.
[39:24.620 --> 39:29.560]  And of course, he's funded most of the Democrat federal judges out there.
[39:29.560 --> 39:35.220]  So it's no surprise that the Daily Mills reporting New York City's elite are in a tizzy after
[39:35.220 --> 39:41.060]  Justice Department's inadvertently publishes a list of 121 clients, including lawyers,
[39:41.060 --> 39:47.900]  businessmen, socialites, who socialized with the sex cult victims who were forced into
[39:47.900 --> 39:55.500]  prostitution and a satanic sex cult, including federal and state judges in New York.
[39:55.500 --> 39:57.660]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:57.660 --> 40:06.060]  We are facing more and more a criminal judiciary, a criminal judiciary controlled by all sorts
[40:06.060 --> 40:11.860]  of criminal organizations and groups, and a good percentage of them are pedophiles.
[40:11.860 --> 40:16.140]  There are still some good judges and some good district attorneys, but more and more,
[40:16.140 --> 40:20.580]  this is how the globalists have chosen to capture our nation and take over our planet.
[40:20.580 --> 40:27.900]  Now back to Owen Schreuer and the live transmission at infowars.com and band.video.
[40:27.900 --> 40:32.620]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission, you've got to share it and override their
[40:32.620 --> 40:37.260]  censorship because you are the resistance.
[40:37.260 --> 40:43.940]  Back here live in the info wars studio, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm just I'm just overwhelmed
[40:43.940 --> 40:46.740]  with the news.
[40:46.740 --> 40:53.260]  It becomes a challenge just to focus and cover one story because you dig into one story,
[40:53.260 --> 40:56.460]  you just connect the rest of the dots just like just like Alex was just doing.
[40:56.460 --> 40:59.580]  It's like, hmm, okay, let's see here.
[40:59.580 --> 41:07.060]  Pedophile protecting judge, okay, Hunter Biden's laptop with all the sex and drug abuse and
[41:07.060 --> 41:11.540]  minors and everything on that, okay, covered up by the media.
[41:11.540 --> 41:16.700]  The left going into the classroom and teaching kids how to be gay and mutilate their genitals
[41:16.700 --> 41:20.540]  hmm, all right.
[41:20.540 --> 41:26.260]  And it's just it's so demonic.
[41:26.260 --> 41:27.820]  It's so satanic.
[41:27.820 --> 41:31.380]  It's so filthy and disgusting.
[41:31.380 --> 41:38.380]  And yet I'm getting stories and updates sent to me every day about January six defendants
[41:38.380 --> 41:40.580]  that are rotting and being tortured in jail.
[41:40.580 --> 41:42.580]  Joe Biggs has now spent a year in jail.
[41:42.580 --> 41:48.300]  He's just been placed on 30 days solitary confinement.
[41:48.300 --> 41:58.580]  But a group of four teens use, they always have code words, you know what it is, murder
[41:58.580 --> 42:04.260]  a woman in broad daylight and have their charges dropped.
[42:04.260 --> 42:09.020]  How does an individual in Houston go into school, shoot up the school, including a teacher?
[42:09.020 --> 42:14.540]  He's released from jail in less than 24 hours.
[42:14.540 --> 42:17.300]  How has our nation become so broke?
[42:17.300 --> 42:19.380]  I mean, that's the question people should be answering.
[42:19.380 --> 42:22.060]  How has our country become such a failed state?
[42:22.060 --> 42:23.300]  How have we become so broke?
[42:23.300 --> 42:25.580]  How have we become so corrupt?
[42:25.580 --> 42:30.900]  It's all by design, ladies and gentlemen, this is the fall of America.
[42:30.900 --> 42:32.460]  This is the fall of the free market.
[42:32.460 --> 42:36.100]  This is the fall of a sovereign nation state.
[42:36.100 --> 42:40.940]  And it just sucks that we have to sit here and deal with it because whether you're left
[42:40.940 --> 42:48.980]  right center, whatever you are politically, everybody should be standing together in unison
[42:48.980 --> 42:53.660]  against the great reset and against the new world order that's going to enslave all of
[42:53.660 --> 43:23.500]  us, but you get deceived by the propaganda.
[43:23.500 --> 43:29.100]  So the chemicals that we ingest, and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to
[43:29.100 --> 43:34.220]  change who we are, are only lowering us, they're only making us more depressed, from the end
[43:34.220 --> 43:35.740]  they're only making us less filled.
[43:35.740 --> 43:41.020]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[43:41.020 --> 43:42.020]  ourselves.
[43:42.020 --> 43:46.140]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the
[43:46.140 --> 43:51.500]  normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able
[43:51.500 --> 43:54.500]  to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[43:54.500 --> 43:58.180]  And that's where the incredible products come in at M4store.com.
[43:58.180 --> 44:03.020]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[44:03.020 --> 44:05.060]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[44:05.060 --> 44:10.780]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[44:10.780 --> 44:11.780]  But we failed.
[44:11.780 --> 44:13.260]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[44:13.260 --> 44:19.020]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[44:19.020 --> 44:21.380]  deindustrialization great reset.
[44:21.380 --> 44:25.660]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[44:25.660 --> 44:30.260]  they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[44:30.260 --> 44:33.220]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[44:33.220 --> 44:35.380]  And we've also got to get personally prepared.
[44:35.380 --> 44:38.100]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[44:38.100 --> 44:43.100]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at M4store.com.
[44:43.100 --> 44:47.140]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[44:47.140 --> 44:48.780]  to ship right now.
[44:48.780 --> 44:53.700]  Get your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[44:53.700 --> 44:55.980]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[44:55.980 --> 44:57.780]  Get ready at M4store.com.
[44:57.780 --> 44:59.500]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome.
[44:59.500 --> 45:00.500]  Go ahead.
[45:00.500 --> 45:01.500]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[45:01.500 --> 45:02.500]  Good, Alex.
[45:02.500 --> 45:03.500]  Great last caller.
[45:03.500 --> 45:08.500]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements.
[45:08.500 --> 45:13.500]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization,
[45:13.500 --> 45:14.500]  and absurdity.
[45:14.500 --> 45:17.500]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[45:17.500 --> 45:19.020]  We've got Eric in New Hampshire.
[45:19.020 --> 45:20.020]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[45:20.020 --> 45:21.020]  Go ahead.
[45:21.020 --> 45:22.020]  Hey, Alex.
[45:22.020 --> 45:23.020]  Thanks for taking my call.
[45:23.020 --> 45:25.020]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[45:25.020 --> 45:26.520]  The X2 does wonders.
[45:26.520 --> 45:28.020]  I recommend it to everybody.
[45:28.020 --> 45:29.020]  You're on the fence about it.
[45:29.020 --> 45:30.020]  Get off the fence.
[45:30.020 --> 45:31.020]  Get the product.
[45:31.020 --> 45:32.020]  Support the M4.
[45:32.020 --> 45:33.020]  Tyler in Maine.
[45:33.020 --> 45:34.020]  You're on the air.
[45:34.020 --> 45:35.020]  Thanks for holding.
[45:35.020 --> 45:36.020]  Go ahead.
[45:36.020 --> 45:37.020]  Hey, Alex.
[45:37.020 --> 45:38.020]  It's great to be on with you.
[45:38.020 --> 45:39.020]  It's an honor.
[45:39.020 --> 45:40.020]  Honored to talk to you.
[45:40.020 --> 45:41.020]  Awesome.
[45:41.020 --> 45:44.860]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, alpha power, even at 29.
[45:44.860 --> 45:49.700]  She asked my better half, she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[45:49.700 --> 45:50.700]  for a few of us there.
[45:50.700 --> 45:51.700]  Well, it definitely works.
[45:51.700 --> 45:52.700]  It's not a joke.
[45:52.700 --> 45:53.700]  Absolutely.
[45:53.700 --> 46:02.820]  Introducing the newest product from InfoWarsLife.com.
[46:02.820 --> 46:06.340]  We are so proud of InfoWarsLife immune support.

[46:12.500 --> 46:13.500]  defenses.
[46:13.500 --> 46:18.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential and everyone should get, and
[46:18.300 --> 46:21.740]  on top of it, it funds the InfoWars so that's a 360 win.
[46:21.740 --> 46:25.100]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.

[46:31.100 --> 46:33.580]  loatium root, and more.
[46:33.580 --> 46:35.500]  This product is incredible.
[46:35.500 --> 46:40.860]  InfoWars immune support, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com, is funding the tip of
[46:40.860 --> 46:43.180]  the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[46:43.180 --> 46:44.580]  It is a 360 win.
[46:44.580 --> 46:49.020]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[46:49.020 --> 46:51.660]  natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.
[46:51.660 --> 46:54.100]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[46:54.100 --> 46:55.100]  Take action now.
[46:55.100 --> 46:57.100]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[46:57.100 --> 47:23.100]  This product is available at InfoWarsLife.com, and on top of it, it funds the InfoWars operation.
[47:23.100 --> 47:35.780]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones show, Owen Schreuer sitting in studio, but first,
[47:35.780 --> 47:40.060]  another report from Alex Jones.
[47:40.060 --> 47:43.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[47:43.940 --> 47:47.740]  Owen Schreuer is going to be taking over live here in just a moment, but I wanted to lay
[47:47.740 --> 47:54.900]  out the basic facts of why I started the broadcast with a Supreme Court nominee saying that she
[47:54.900 --> 47:57.460]  can't say what a woman is.
[47:57.460 --> 48:02.780]  That is the reason we're in so much trouble is the cult-like control the left has over
[48:02.780 --> 48:10.020]  their minions' minds and the litmus test of total submission to fraud that they have
[48:10.020 --> 48:16.380]  to subserve themselves to to be given access to the power structure.
[48:16.380 --> 48:21.860]  It shows that they are unthinking slaves of the biomedical tyranny.
[48:21.860 --> 48:28.220]  Now, let's talk about the current situation in Ukraine.
[48:28.220 --> 48:35.100]  Biden seeks new sanctions, help for Ukraine and Europe, hellscape, where over 100,000
[48:35.100 --> 48:42.820]  people are trapped in one city alone, outgunned Air Force fighting back, dissent bruise over
[48:42.820 --> 48:49.820]  Putin leadership, Vlad allies warned of nuclear dystopia, squads ordered to kill deserting soldiers
[48:49.820 --> 48:57.780]  on both sides, church promotes war, Kremlin lashes out at Poland, Belarusian military
[48:57.780 --> 49:00.860]  could soon join war.
[49:00.860 --> 49:02.740]  That's what happens with wars.
[49:02.740 --> 49:04.380]  They escalate very, very quickly.
[49:04.380 --> 49:12.800]  There was a big poll out, 70% of Russians want Russia to attack Poland for staging troops
[49:12.800 --> 49:13.800]  and weapons there.
[49:13.800 --> 49:20.220]  Can you imagine if Poland would have actually given those MiG fighters over to Ukraine?
[49:20.220 --> 49:23.100]  And that's how these wars escalate very, very quickly.
[49:23.100 --> 49:29.020]  And that's why it's bad that Soros and NATO destabilized and push Russia into this.
[49:29.020 --> 49:30.780]  Doesn't mean it's good that Putin invaded.
[49:30.780 --> 49:37.500]  But now this is the crisis we're sitting in the middle of with gas rationing signs, gasoline
[49:37.500 --> 49:43.780]  and diesel rationing signs going up on the east and west coast, where it's telling you
[49:43.780 --> 49:46.980]  you can get a limited amount of fuel.
[49:46.980 --> 49:53.540]  Because along with massive increases in prices, we're also seeing the hyperinflation that
[49:53.540 --> 49:57.580]  is going to send a cascade effect out into the economy across the world.
[49:57.580 --> 50:02.340]  This was caused by the private central banks, particularly the EU and China, but the US
[50:02.340 --> 50:10.180]  a close second overprinting euros, dollars, yen, yawn and other major currencies.
[50:10.180 --> 50:15.380]  And how convenient now that Vlad has invaded so that he can take the blame.
[50:15.380 --> 50:17.060]  Is Vlad in smoky rooms?
[50:17.060 --> 50:21.380]  Everybody asked me this on the street and in the office and on the air with callers.
[50:21.380 --> 50:23.020]  Is Vlad in on this at all stage?
[50:23.020 --> 50:24.540]  The answer is no.
[50:24.540 --> 50:31.860]  But if you know all those geopolitical fishers, Vladimir Putin has been saying since 2007,
[50:31.860 --> 50:38.260]  if you continue to move weapons in up to our borders, continue to have NATO expand, then
[50:38.260 --> 50:40.100]  we may invade one of those countries.
[50:40.100 --> 50:45.580]  So he mass troops there months ago, said he might invade if they didn't make a declaration
[50:45.580 --> 50:48.500]  that Ukraine would not join NATO.
[50:48.500 --> 50:52.780]  And instead was Alinsky and others said they were trying to join NATO and the Euro.
[50:52.780 --> 50:58.340]  Then Biden pulled out of Afghanistan very precipitously, made a fool out of himself.
[50:58.340 --> 51:01.340]  I believed on purpose to entice Russia to invade.
[51:01.340 --> 51:06.300]  I said that at the time and then what else happened?
[51:06.300 --> 51:10.380]  Biden said two weeks before Putin invaded, we're not going to militarily strike back
[51:10.380 --> 51:11.860]  if you invade.
[51:11.860 --> 51:15.340]  Just don't take the whole country and you notice Putin has only taken about a third
[51:15.340 --> 51:16.340]  of the country.
[51:16.340 --> 51:21.340]  So at high levels, they signaled and they communicated and that's a fact.
[51:21.340 --> 51:24.780]  And remember, I'm not just telling you this in hindsight to sound smart.
[51:24.780 --> 51:28.620]  Once you know that this is what's really going on and knowledge is power, that's how I told
[51:28.620 --> 51:34.500]  you in October that I thought that Russia or China, both, China's back down, it's not
[51:34.500 --> 51:39.620]  going well for Russia right now, would be invading Taiwan and Ukraine.
[51:39.620 --> 51:45.820]  And that's the best thing we've got at this point on that situation.
[51:45.820 --> 51:49.420]  Infowars is truly tomorrow's news today.
[51:49.420 --> 51:53.180]  The globalists don't want the public to be able to reverse engineer what they're doing
[51:53.180 --> 51:59.100]  because knowledge is power and as Christ said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[51:59.100 --> 52:04.940]  That's why I'm asking listeners now to count the cost and realize how important you are
[52:04.940 --> 52:09.820]  to make the commitment today and every day to tell perfect strangers, your neighbors,
[52:09.820 --> 52:14.700]  your coworkers, people at church, folks in parking lots, people at the grocery store,
[52:14.700 --> 52:21.860]  people online about the truth living at infowars.com and the real resistance to this tyranny forming
[52:21.860 --> 52:27.260]  at infowars.com for a peaceful revolution of understanding and renaissance.
[52:27.260 --> 52:32.500]  Please promote Bandai Video and infowars.com by word of mouth and then URLs, they haven't
[52:32.500 --> 52:35.820]  blocked yet, like battleplan.news.
[52:35.820 --> 52:41.780]  And separately, we have the Democratic Party funded, Soros funded, Bloomberg funded, globalist
[52:41.780 --> 52:49.220]  law firms in rig courts and rig trials trying to shut us down and we don't even have the
[52:49.220 --> 52:50.660]  funds to go through these battles.
[52:50.660 --> 52:55.140]  We need the funds so that we get a shot at an appeal later or at least stall them so
[52:55.140 --> 52:59.580]  they're not able to shut down infowars, which is their admitted un-American plan.
[52:59.580 --> 53:03.820]  The New York Times again says they want to shut down the case for ending the First Amendment,
[53:03.820 --> 53:05.700]  the free speech problem.
[53:05.700 --> 53:11.300]  These are very, very sinister forces, ladies and gentlemen, but your prayers, your word
[53:11.300 --> 53:16.540]  of mouth is overriding them and your funds will continue to keep us on air as obviously
[53:16.540 --> 53:21.260]  other backup systems with other independent private groups have already been established.
[53:21.260 --> 53:25.900]  But we need to keep infowars as a flagship, the mothership battling and continuing to
[53:25.900 --> 53:30.180]  have devastating victories in the heart of the battle, but your funds are ammunition
[53:30.180 --> 53:31.340]  in the info war.
[53:31.340 --> 53:39.060]  So go now to infowars.com, infowars.com, infowars.com and get all the amazing products that have
[53:39.060 --> 53:43.740]  finally come back into stock, like the fizzy magnesium powder that's so good, it's got

[53:47.660 --> 53:50.060]  electrochemical activity, your immune system, everything else.

[53:55.060 --> 53:59.100]  the nitrous oxide in the blood, looking at how good that is for you and your arteries,
[53:59.100 --> 54:00.220]  everything else.
[54:00.220 --> 54:08.900]  It is, it is 40% off, bio tricillinium is 40% off, and so much more in our newest product.
[54:08.900 --> 54:11.580]  I tried to get this developed over the last few years, supply chain breakdowns, we couldn't
[54:11.580 --> 54:12.580]  do it.
[54:12.580 --> 54:18.780]  And just got produced last month here in America, it is our immune support with all these key
[54:18.780 --> 54:22.900]  concentrated herbs that helps your body take its immunity to the next level and supercharges
[54:22.900 --> 54:26.620]  vitamin D and all the other compounds that are out there that God gave us.
[54:26.620 --> 54:33.260]  It is 25% off, the new info wars live immune support at infowarsstore.com or triple eight
[54:33.260 --> 54:36.420]  two five three three one three nine.
[54:36.420 --> 54:43.180]  Now back to Owen shroyer and the live transmission.
[54:43.180 --> 54:46.900]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, and in this second hour, I'm going to actually cover all
[54:46.900 --> 54:47.900]  the news.
[54:47.900 --> 54:52.540]  I'm going to get to all the headlines and all the video clips.
[54:52.540 --> 55:00.140]  But I'm just kind of sitting here reflecting on everything.
[55:00.140 --> 55:08.380]  And I realize that my frustration is, I really can't even cover this news anymore.
[55:08.380 --> 55:09.380]  Seriously.
[55:09.380 --> 55:12.180]  I mean, that's the problem.
[55:12.180 --> 55:13.740]  Everybody knows what's going on.
[55:13.740 --> 55:15.700]  It's the great reset is public.
[55:15.700 --> 55:17.740]  The New World Order is public.
[55:17.740 --> 55:19.980]  The the pro pedophilia is public.
[55:19.980 --> 55:23.820]  The protection of the corrupt political class like the Bidens is public.
[55:23.820 --> 55:28.900]  I don't need to come on here and break this news every day, because it's it's already
[55:28.900 --> 55:31.420]  out there, people already get it.
[55:31.420 --> 55:35.660]  And it's even making its way into mainstream news now where not everybody that's a total
[55:35.660 --> 55:41.260]  corrupt sold out bastard is starting to report on it and call it out and then they get banned
[55:41.260 --> 55:46.980]  from network news and okay, so then they go to alternative news platforms as well and
[55:46.980 --> 55:49.440]  big tech ban zone.
[55:49.440 --> 55:50.740]  So it's all happening.
[55:50.740 --> 55:55.300]  Everything is like info wars next year is new today, info wars next decade is new today.
[55:55.300 --> 56:04.820]  So it becomes this struggle of do I report the news and everything that's going on now
[56:04.820 --> 56:10.820]  to then make the final conclusion or then report the bigger story about all of its leading
[56:10.820 --> 56:18.780]  to the great reset and how and how you're being propagandized 24 seven because we can
[56:18.780 --> 56:21.340]  sit here and tell you what's coming next.
[56:21.340 --> 56:27.020]  I mean, we can sit here just like we've done with Alex Jones and info wars for 20 plus
[56:27.020 --> 56:30.780]  years and tell you what's coming next all day long.
[56:30.780 --> 56:34.780]  But I think you already get that.
[56:34.780 --> 56:45.140]  So the real challenge is what do we do to be even more effective now?
[56:45.140 --> 56:50.940]  And it's it's this weird thing where it's almost as if we have to just accept now we're
[56:50.940 --> 56:58.500]  in this and then get out of kind of the defensive or offensive position in the information war
[56:58.500 --> 57:02.540]  and not wave the white flag or give up.
[57:02.540 --> 57:07.620]  But just like like start dancing or something ridiculous and like turn into a court gesture
[57:07.620 --> 57:08.620]  and it's well known.
[57:08.620 --> 57:15.340]  I mean, you would have kings with their comedians their court gestures and as soon as they would
[57:15.340 --> 57:19.780]  start making jokes about the king or point out flaws and royalty, well, what would happen
[57:19.780 --> 57:24.540]  they'd get killed because see that aspect of comedy at a certain point in political
[57:24.540 --> 57:29.980]  corruption becomes more devastating than actually telling the truth about what they're doing
[57:29.980 --> 57:34.060]  is is accepting that that's the reality and then joking about it becomes more effective
[57:34.060 --> 57:36.220]  than actually just talking about what it is.
[57:36.220 --> 57:38.300]  And I'm thinking we may have reached that position.
[57:38.300 --> 57:42.900]  It's kind of like in, you know, in Guardians of the Galaxy when Chris Pratt starts dancing
[57:42.900 --> 57:45.460]  at the end to distract a bad guy and that's how they defeat him.
[57:45.460 --> 57:51.060]  It's like, is that what info wars needs to do now, ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[57:51.060 --> 57:54.500]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[57:54.500 --> 57:58.500]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[57:58.500 --> 57:59.700]  I was born for this.
[57:59.700 --> 58:04.180]  You were born for this and people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[58:04.180 --> 58:09.180]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions
[58:09.180 --> 58:10.180]  of dollars.
[58:10.180 --> 58:15.780]  With Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands
[58:15.780 --> 58:21.380]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[58:21.380 --> 58:26.260]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[58:26.260 --> 58:30.740]  Info wars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[58:30.740 --> 58:37.060]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[58:37.060 --> 58:38.860]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[58:38.860 --> 58:43.140]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[58:43.140 --> 58:48.580]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keeping info wars as strong as ever.
[58:48.580 --> 58:55.140]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth, then the
[58:55.140 --> 58:59.180]  next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[58:59.180 --> 59:07.060]  No, that invariably follows, but first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty
[59:07.060 --> 59:10.180]  and speech and massive censorship.
[59:10.180 --> 59:15.780]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[59:15.780 --> 59:24.500]  that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[59:24.500 --> 59:26.580]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[59:26.580 --> 59:32.660]  And of course now Canada is in a dislegislation that if you have a thought crime and they
[59:32.660 --> 59:38.580]  think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored
[59:38.580 --> 59:39.580]  and arrested.
[59:39.580 --> 59:43.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[59:43.860 --> 59:50.540]  the world against humanity that makes info wars.com more important than ever.
[59:50.540 --> 1:00:06.740]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:06.740 --> 1:00:12.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you understand this next story, you really begin to understand
[1:00:12.460 --> 1:00:14.020]  everything.
[1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:20.740]  And while this is just an aspect of the fake news and the propaganda, as soon as you realize
[1:00:20.740 --> 1:00:26.220]  it is literally fake news, that's not just a cliche, it's literally fake news, it's literally
[1:00:26.220 --> 1:00:31.940]  propaganda and it's aimed at you as a psychological weapon of war to conquer you.
[1:00:31.940 --> 1:00:38.260]  As soon as you get and understand that everything else flows from that, that's the antithesis.
[1:00:38.260 --> 1:00:41.920]  That's why the censorship is so heavy right now because they know that's the beginning,
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:43.220]  that's why info war is so effective.
[1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:46.220]  So if you understand this story, you understand everything.
[1:00:46.220 --> 1:00:51.300]  And we've had similar stories here in America, but this one is from Canada and it's just
[1:00:51.300 --> 1:00:57.500]  been revealed, but it's the same thing, whether it's the Hunter Biden laptop or a fire extinguisher
[1:00:57.500 --> 1:01:02.940]  was used to beat in Officer Brian Sicknick, all lies, all proven.
[1:01:02.940 --> 1:01:13.460]  So during the Freedom Convoy, Canadian media propaganda and parliament members said that
[1:01:13.460 --> 1:01:19.660]  the Freedom Convoy was responsible for arson and they were burning down buildings in Canada.
[1:01:19.660 --> 1:01:21.460]  They all said it.
[1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:29.060]  Well they admit now, as of this week, they're now admitting that never happened, literally
[1:01:29.060 --> 1:01:34.660]  never happened, there was no connection with the Freedom Convoy and arson and the police
[1:01:34.660 --> 1:01:40.420]  have come out and confirmed that and now even it's mainstream media arson a tip during Freedom
[1:01:40.420 --> 1:01:43.420]  Convoy has no connection to protesters now.
[1:01:43.420 --> 1:01:46.860]  So they admit this now a month after all of it, two months after all of it, they admit
[1:01:46.860 --> 1:01:51.580]  they lied just like they lied about Officer Sicknick being hit with a fire extinguisher.
[1:01:51.580 --> 1:01:52.580]  That was a lie.
[1:01:52.580 --> 1:01:57.580]  They lied about the Freedom Convoy being connected to an arson event.
[1:01:57.580 --> 1:02:02.860]  That happened, never happened, but it was the biggest story at the time.
[1:02:02.860 --> 1:02:11.620]  So here's a compilation of all the Canadian media and Canadian members of parliament adding
[1:02:11.620 --> 1:02:17.580]  fuel to this fake news story and perpetuating this lie on the people of Canada that's now
[1:02:17.580 --> 1:02:18.580]  been totally disproven.
[1:02:18.580 --> 1:02:20.300]  Will there be any apology?
[1:02:20.300 --> 1:02:21.300]  No.
[1:02:21.300 --> 1:02:22.300]  Is anyone going to get sued?
[1:02:22.300 --> 1:02:23.300]  No.
[1:02:23.300 --> 1:02:24.300]  It's propaganda.
[1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:28.380]  They're agents acting against you with psychological warfare.
[1:02:28.380 --> 1:02:35.580]  Here's the clip of Canadian media and members of parliament lying all day long about the
[1:02:35.580 --> 1:02:39.220]  Freedom Convoy and an arson event.
[1:02:39.220 --> 1:02:41.820]  Violence is commonplace.
[1:02:41.820 --> 1:02:48.500]  We saw an example of this violence and attempted arson downtown of an apartment building where
[1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:55.980]  people started a fire when they exited, they taped the door.
[1:02:55.980 --> 1:03:00.300]  An attempted arson, all of which, Madam Speaker, was caught on video.
[1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:04.980]  It has been an illegal occupation that has been harassing people in residential areas
[1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:06.100]  of Ottawa.
[1:03:06.100 --> 1:03:08.060]  People don't feel safe in their own homes.
[1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:10.900]  There have been reports of attempted arson.
[1:03:10.900 --> 1:03:16.500]  Canadians are also concerned hearing reports of an attempted arson in the lobby of a residential
[1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:17.940]  apartment building.
[1:03:17.940 --> 1:03:24.380]  As we see hate speech, we see illegal acts such as arson.
[1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:31.180]  The incessant honking, the arson attempts, the incessant honking, the arson attempts,
[1:03:31.180 --> 1:03:35.340]  an attempted arson of a residential building in the occupation area.
[1:03:35.340 --> 1:03:41.620]  We've seen the active sabotage of 911 emergency call lines and even an attempted arson.
[1:03:41.620 --> 1:03:44.740]  Other alleged crimes have even been more egregious.
[1:03:44.740 --> 1:03:48.460]  Several police are investigating the attempted arson of a downtown apartment building.
[1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:51.300]  The situation persists, fueled in part by foreign funding.
[1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:54.260]  We saw reports of attempted arson in some of the building.
[1:03:54.260 --> 1:03:59.140]  And it certainly does not include arson or pushing into a residential apartment building
[1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:01.580]  and barricading the exits with handcuffs.
[1:04:01.580 --> 1:04:06.420]  The arrests for conspiracy to murder attempted arson of a residential building.
[1:04:06.420 --> 1:04:10.140]  Over the past three weeks, we have watched assaults attempted arson.
[1:04:10.140 --> 1:04:14.700]  They have been living in fear, fear that their apartment buildings may be torched
[1:04:14.700 --> 1:04:15.700]  by arson.
[1:04:15.700 --> 1:04:18.740]  We've seen assaults attempted arson, widespread harassment.
[1:04:18.740 --> 1:04:24.660]  There's been attempted arson with the attempt of handcuffing doors shut so that if a fire
[1:04:24.660 --> 1:04:27.740]  started, people would be burned alive.
[1:04:27.740 --> 1:04:30.580]  Death threats, an attempted arson.
[1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:35.660]  A building had an attempted arson where the doors were taped shut.
[1:04:35.660 --> 1:04:39.500]  Another building had occupiers attempting to handcuff the doors.
[1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:42.260]  There are reports of attempted arson, bomb threats.
[1:04:42.260 --> 1:04:45.580]  K crimes, misogyny, arson.
[1:04:45.580 --> 1:04:48.220]  Horns honked all night long.
[1:04:48.220 --> 1:04:51.060]  We saw thefts and attempted arson.
[1:04:51.060 --> 1:04:52.740]  It literally never happened, folks.
[1:04:52.740 --> 1:04:53.740]  It literally never happened.
[1:04:53.740 --> 1:04:59.340]  But the left burns buildings to the ground, they call it a peaceful protest.
[1:04:59.340 --> 1:05:03.900]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true, that Info Wars
[1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:11.940]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[1:05:11.940 --> 1:05:16.660]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[1:05:16.660 --> 1:05:23.340]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[1:05:23.340 --> 1:05:24.340]  done.
[1:05:24.340 --> 1:05:29.300]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at
[1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:30.300]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:35.580]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you, and so now we need to support more
[1:05:35.580 --> 1:05:41.860]  than ever because this fight has intensified, don't need me to tell you that, at InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:05:41.860 --> 1:05:45.860]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[1:05:45.860 --> 1:05:50.260]  Things have been sold out for a long time, like InfoWarsLife, Fizzy Magnesium Mix, that's
[1:05:50.260 --> 1:05:54.700]  so amazing, and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[1:05:54.700 --> 1:05:59.780]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at InfoWarsTour.com right now.
[1:05:59.780 --> 1:06:03.580]  Great reset, tough guy.
[1:06:03.580 --> 1:06:04.740]  It's called the New World Order.
[1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:09.060]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can
[1:06:09.060 --> 1:06:13.940]  loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal
[1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:14.940]  basic income.
[1:06:14.940 --> 1:06:15.940]  That's everything.
[1:06:15.940 --> 1:06:18.180]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[1:06:18.180 --> 1:06:22.980]  The whole world's going to be about surveillance and control and them manipulating and tracking
[1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:23.980]  everything you do.
[1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:24.980]  It's all being officially announced.
[1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:28.620]  We've got articles everywhere, they're press releases, saying it.
[1:06:28.620 --> 1:06:35.540]  And then the crew asks me during the break, they go, are you alright, you really seem
[1:06:35.540 --> 1:06:36.540]  upset.
[1:06:36.540 --> 1:06:37.540]  Are you feeling okay?
[1:06:37.540 --> 1:06:42.220]  They're going to starve a couple hundred million people to death, yeah, I'm pretty freaked
[1:06:42.220 --> 1:06:43.220]  out, yeah.
[1:06:43.220 --> 1:06:44.220]  This is real.
[1:06:44.220 --> 1:06:48.220]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[1:06:48.220 --> 1:06:55.220]  You understand, like I left you, right, I left you, I told you that time.
[1:06:55.220 --> 1:07:00.660]  People are already starting to get like hundreds of millions right now, you never see it on
[1:07:00.660 --> 1:07:01.660]  news.
[1:07:01.660 --> 1:07:02.660]  They're dying right now.
[1:07:02.660 --> 1:07:06.740]  They're in, they're freaking out, he's starting to get begging for God's help, and no one's
[1:07:06.740 --> 1:07:12.740]  coming because God tells us to get up and take action, and then we don't do anything.
[1:07:12.740 --> 1:07:15.740]  And that paralyzes God.
[1:07:15.740 --> 1:07:22.540]  Yeah, God can do it, but God needs us to do it because that's not pretty well.
[1:07:22.540 --> 1:07:26.940]  Once again, for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out
[1:07:26.940 --> 1:07:27.940]  to be true.
[1:07:27.940 --> 1:07:28.940]  Yeah, I'm upset.
[1:07:28.940 --> 1:07:33.940]  I'm really, I told you last night what's wrong with you, I'm really freaked out.
[1:07:33.940 --> 1:07:38.740]  I'm really freaked out, I'm really freaked out, I'm really freaked out, you see, because
[1:07:38.740 --> 1:07:39.740]  this is real.
[1:07:39.740 --> 1:07:47.060]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off is real.
[1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:51.020]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air, I mean if we don't
[1:07:51.020 --> 1:07:56.580]  back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalist, I mean, we won't be
[1:07:56.580 --> 1:07:57.580]  here in six months.
[1:07:57.580 --> 1:08:10.980]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:11.980]  Infowars.com.
[1:08:11.980 --> 1:08:12.980]  Infowars comes to mind.
[1:08:12.980 --> 1:08:13.980]  Infowars.com.
[1:08:13.980 --> 1:08:14.980]  Infowars.
[1:08:14.980 --> 1:08:15.980]  You watch Infowars?
[1:08:15.980 --> 1:08:16.980]  Infowars.
[1:08:16.980 --> 1:08:17.980]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[1:08:17.980 --> 1:08:18.980]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:19.980]  Nice guy.
[1:08:19.980 --> 1:08:23.980]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[1:08:23.980 --> 1:08:24.980]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:24.980 --> 1:08:25.980]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:26.980]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:26.980 --> 1:08:27.980]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:27.980 --> 1:08:28.980]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[1:08:28.980 --> 1:08:30.980]  He knows who Infowars is.
[1:08:30.980 --> 1:08:31.980]  Playing this joke over here.
[1:08:31.980 --> 1:08:32.980]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[1:08:32.980 --> 1:08:33.980]  Alex has been right on for a decade.
[1:08:33.980 --> 1:08:45.220]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[1:08:45.220 --> 1:08:51.340]  The globalist crime syndicate always telegraphs their next move.
[1:08:51.340 --> 1:08:56.700]  They do that for a lot of reasons, but the big one is shelling off to their minions in
[1:08:56.700 --> 1:09:02.500]  government and in corporations so that they realize how much power the shadow government
[1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:03.500]  has.
[1:09:03.500 --> 1:09:08.300]  And if you look at Klaus Schwab, if you look at the U.N., if you look at Bill Gates, if
[1:09:08.300 --> 1:09:13.980]  you look at academia, if you look at the Biden administration and the State Department and
[1:09:13.980 --> 1:09:21.460]  the CIA, they have been saying for years, the Russians are going to launch an attack
[1:09:21.460 --> 1:09:23.900]  on our power grid.
[1:09:23.900 --> 1:09:30.380]  But don't worry, once the attack on the power grid happens, we will reset things and the
[1:09:30.380 --> 1:09:35.980]  dollar will no longer be what you use, or the yen, or the yen, or the ruble, or it'll
[1:09:35.980 --> 1:09:38.460]  be a new global currency.
[1:09:38.460 --> 1:09:44.180]  So they're trying to get out of the worldwide financial bubble they've created.
[1:09:44.180 --> 1:09:47.260]  They don't want to go to prison like Bernie Madoff.
[1:09:47.260 --> 1:09:53.380]  And so they want to terrorize everyone and make them believe that in a war, somebody
[1:09:53.380 --> 1:09:58.900]  attacked their bank accounts, somebody attacked their power grid, the Russians.
[1:09:58.900 --> 1:10:06.020]  And so now they've got to come in with a whole new system and you see them as the saviors.
[1:10:06.020 --> 1:10:08.380]  This is the big issue.
[1:10:08.380 --> 1:10:13.220]  And it's the next move, and I've been telling you for two years that after the virus fair
[1:10:13.220 --> 1:10:20.780]  monitoring, they would then move on to a war and then a cyber attack.
[1:10:20.780 --> 1:10:25.860]  And just like clockwork, all the different globalist mouthpieces are there.
[1:10:25.860 --> 1:10:29.940]  I mean, we've seen Klaus Schwab here and a half ago going, if you'll sink, said you'd
[1:10:29.940 --> 1:10:35.260]  use bad from COVID, wait until you'll seize it.
[1:10:35.260 --> 1:10:41.020]  Power outage, this cyber attack, this will help us with the great reset.
[1:10:41.020 --> 1:10:45.620]  They don't even hide what they're doing.
[1:10:45.620 --> 1:10:47.140]  So we're smart enough to understand this.
[1:10:47.140 --> 1:10:52.620]  We're smart enough to realize what we're facing and to get the word out and let people understand
[1:10:52.620 --> 1:10:58.580]  that the globalists get power from crises and that they want the control collapse of
[1:10:58.580 --> 1:11:02.540]  civilization and they don't have our best interests at heart.
[1:11:02.540 --> 1:11:06.580]  This is the most critical information we've ever released.
[1:11:06.580 --> 1:11:10.740]  We've proven we have a track record of seeing over the horizon with predictions.
[1:11:10.740 --> 1:11:13.180]  And I believe in humanity and I'm betting on you.
[1:11:13.180 --> 1:11:17.620]  And I believe that the majority of us from a race, color, and creed don't want to live
[1:11:17.620 --> 1:11:21.940]  in a collapse society, civil war, road, warrior situation.
[1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:27.380]  And I believe now you have the smarts to help us all collectively get out of this, not just
[1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:32.420]  as Paul Revere's, but as individuals that help build the new civilization, it's so beautiful,
[1:11:32.420 --> 1:11:41.460]  so powerful, so amazing that the globalist model of conquest and evil becomes obsolete.
[1:11:41.460 --> 1:11:51.100]  Now you may notice we already have the signs and symptoms that you're living in the Mad
[1:11:51.100 --> 1:11:54.700]  Max Thunderdome scenario already.
[1:11:54.700 --> 1:12:00.180]  The massive crime sprees, the massive increase in homicide rates.
[1:12:00.180 --> 1:12:07.700]  I mean, I could do three hours a day of broadcasting just covering all the crime that goes on.
[1:12:07.700 --> 1:12:11.580]  There's always in Democrat run cities, by the way, I don't believe that's a coincidence.
[1:12:11.580 --> 1:12:13.540]  In fact, I know it's not.
[1:12:13.540 --> 1:12:20.220]  Democrats go light on crime and so criminals run wild, criminals run rampant.
[1:12:20.220 --> 1:12:25.100]  And now they've told black people that, yeah, commit crimes as much as you want and we will
[1:12:25.100 --> 1:12:26.780]  defend you and drop your charges.
[1:12:26.780 --> 1:12:28.460]  You commit murder, we'll drop your charges.
[1:12:28.460 --> 1:12:33.300]  You rape a woman, we'll drop your charges as long as you're black.
[1:12:33.300 --> 1:12:37.820]  And that's what goes on now.
[1:12:37.820 --> 1:12:42.980]  And you can look at the video and the situation that just came out in New Orleans, we're on
[1:12:42.980 --> 1:12:50.900]  the elderly white woman, grandma, it's dragged out of her car and beaten to death by 14s,
[1:12:50.900 --> 1:12:55.140]  14s, non-white supremacists.
[1:12:55.140 --> 1:12:56.140]  And guess what?
[1:12:56.140 --> 1:13:01.580]  They had their charges dropped.
[1:13:01.580 --> 1:13:03.780]  And so that's what happens.
[1:13:03.780 --> 1:13:09.380]  And you're seeing the increase, not just in the crime, but obviously the prices of living
[1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:13.500]  as well.
[1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:15.980]  And you know what's happening now, folks?
[1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:20.140]  People are having their gas stolen out of their vehicles.
[1:13:20.140 --> 1:13:21.620]  People are siphoning gas.
[1:13:21.620 --> 1:13:27.020]  People are drilling into, they're going around to cars that are parked on the street, drilling
[1:13:27.020 --> 1:13:36.540]  into their gas tanks and stealing their fuel, that's now mainstream news.
[1:13:36.540 --> 1:13:43.900]  They're figuring out ways to basically rig the price at the pump.
[1:13:43.900 --> 1:13:50.740]  You see the mass retail crime happening.
[1:13:50.740 --> 1:13:57.980]  Look at this one, more than 1700 gallons of fuel stolen by gas thieves, Constable Mark,
[1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:00.820]  this is in Houston, Constable Mark Herman says the thieves were able to get away with
[1:14:00.820 --> 1:14:05.380]  more than $8,000 worth of fuel from a Chevron gas station.
[1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:09.460]  And that's just one story, that's just happening at the pump.
[1:14:09.460 --> 1:14:15.260]  These criminals are also going out in the streets and drilling into your car's gas tank, taking
[1:14:15.260 --> 1:14:18.660]  it that way, or siphoning it out as well.
[1:14:18.660 --> 1:14:26.740]  Yeah, here's a scene, broad daylight, Beverly Hills broad daylight, a group of teens, a group
[1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:32.060]  of teens, non-white supremacists rob a jewelry store.
[1:14:32.060 --> 1:14:38.380]  And you may recall, it was just a few months ago, there was a petition in Beverly Hills
[1:14:38.380 --> 1:14:45.900]  to get rid of all the jewelry stores because these teens, these youths, keep breaking in
[1:14:45.900 --> 1:14:51.140]  and robbing them sometimes at gunpoint.
[1:14:51.140 --> 1:14:56.140]  You're already in the Mad Max Thunderdome, it's been brought in intentionally, it's
[1:14:56.140 --> 1:15:04.580]  the collapse of civilization, it's called the great reset, it's called build back better.
[1:15:04.580 --> 1:15:12.980]  But first to build back better, you must destroy, that's what the great reset is all about.
[1:15:12.980 --> 1:15:18.340]  And so, see, you have to try to understand the psychology of a globalist, you have to
[1:15:18.340 --> 1:15:22.060]  try to understand the psychology of a cloud swab of a Bill Gates.
[1:15:22.060 --> 1:15:25.900]  Look at it like, they look at this planet like they're playing a game of Sim City or
[1:15:25.900 --> 1:15:29.700]  roller coaster tycoon or something, and they've already done it, they've already accomplished
[1:15:29.700 --> 1:15:32.740]  all their things, they've already beaten all the levels, they've already reached the master
[1:15:32.740 --> 1:15:36.500]  class, they have all the resources, all the money, everything they need.
[1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:41.020]  So they just figured, let's just wipe it all out, let's just destroy this planet and start
[1:15:41.020 --> 1:15:42.020]  over.
[1:15:42.020 --> 1:15:44.620]  That's what they're doing.
[1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:50.780]  You're having your planet, your way of life, your country destroyed intentionally, and
[1:15:50.780 --> 1:15:55.740]  they brag about it, calling it build back better in the great reset, and all the fools fall
[1:15:55.740 --> 1:15:57.340]  for their propaganda.
[1:15:57.340 --> 1:16:04.580]  Our world is so full of hype, we are force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[1:16:04.580 --> 1:16:10.140]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities, and why is this the case?
[1:16:10.140 --> 1:16:15.020]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyche,
[1:16:15.020 --> 1:16:21.220]  our own souls, and by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote
[1:16:21.220 --> 1:16:23.420]  fallen or sinful state.
[1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:28.500]  So the chemicals that we ingest, and all the things that we've got to bring into our bodies
[1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:33.380]  to change who we are, are only lowering us, they're only making us more depressed, and
[1:16:33.380 --> 1:16:35.580]  in the end they're only making us less fulfilled.
[1:16:35.580 --> 1:16:40.740]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[1:16:40.740 --> 1:16:41.740]  ourselves.
[1:16:41.740 --> 1:16:46.420]  That's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal
[1:16:46.420 --> 1:16:51.700]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to
[1:16:51.700 --> 1:16:54.020]  basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[1:16:54.020 --> 1:16:58.460]  And that's where the incredible products come in at infomerstore.com.
[1:16:58.460 --> 1:17:03.100]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans, they financed
[1:17:03.100 --> 1:17:08.300]  the coverage of universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their
[1:17:08.300 --> 1:17:12.980]  propaganda of the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it
[1:17:12.980 --> 1:17:15.340]  is a bad thing and must be ended.
[1:17:15.340 --> 1:17:20.900]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[1:17:20.900 --> 1:17:24.900]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:17:24.900 --> 1:17:29.860]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four-national daughter,
[1:17:29.860 --> 1:17:33.900]  my wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well, I love to make breakfast.
[1:17:33.900 --> 1:17:38.820]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative
[1:17:38.820 --> 1:17:42.380]  and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[1:17:42.380 --> 1:17:48.460]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions
[1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:49.460]  and coming together.
[1:17:49.460 --> 1:17:54.900]  They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn
[1:17:54.900 --> 1:17:55.900]  us into lab rats.
[1:17:55.900 --> 1:17:57.900]  We cannot let this continue.
[1:17:57.900 --> 1:18:07.900]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[1:18:07.900 --> 1:18:14.580]  prince that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[1:18:14.580 --> 1:18:15.580]  lost.
[1:18:15.580 --> 1:18:20.700]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a horror and
[1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:28.220]  you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and
[1:18:28.220 --> 1:18:29.220]  confused.
[1:18:29.220 --> 1:18:30.220]  You have a concussion.
[1:18:30.220 --> 1:18:31.900]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:33.380]  They have stunned us.
[1:18:33.380 --> 1:18:38.260]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently
[1:18:38.260 --> 1:18:42.300]  came out and gave a speech called The Great New Narrative where he brags how the public
[1:18:42.300 --> 1:18:47.180]  is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all
[1:18:47.180 --> 1:18:51.100]  alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[1:18:51.100 --> 1:18:52.660]  That's what The Great Recent is.
[1:18:52.660 --> 1:18:54.180]  They need darkness to thrive.
[1:18:54.180 --> 1:18:58.380]  The light lives at nfowars.com.

[1:19:05.620 --> 1:19:11.500]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:15.220]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.

[1:19:52.740 --> 1:20:20.740]  It's amazing.
[1:20:22.740 --> 1:20:30.740]  How's it all going to go down, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:20:30.740 --> 1:20:38.540]  Are we going to go into a century or a millennia of bondage and oppression against humanity,
[1:20:38.540 --> 1:20:42.660]  the likes of which we may never escape?
[1:20:42.660 --> 1:20:52.980]  Or are we going to go into a new golden age of human enlightenment and prosperity, the
[1:20:52.980 --> 1:20:54.340]  likes of which we've never seen?
[1:20:54.340 --> 1:21:00.500]  And it's Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, our politicians, our mainstream media, all these sex cults,
[1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:04.140]  everyone, they're trying to stop us from going into the next golden age, folks.
[1:21:04.140 --> 1:21:05.220]  They hate you.
[1:21:05.220 --> 1:21:06.440]  They hate your family.
[1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:07.740]  They hate your freedoms.
[1:21:07.740 --> 1:21:09.460]  They hate your God.
[1:21:09.460 --> 1:21:11.620]  They want you dead and enslaved.
[1:21:11.620 --> 1:21:15.580]  We have figured it out yet.
[1:21:15.580 --> 1:21:18.100]  The world doesn't have to be this way.
[1:21:18.100 --> 1:21:20.420]  It doesn't.
[1:21:20.420 --> 1:21:25.860]  But maybe it always will be because we're always going to have to face evil.
[1:21:25.860 --> 1:21:29.780]  But when we hide from evil and we cower from evil and we don't want to address evil and
[1:21:29.780 --> 1:21:34.060]  be honest about it, then evil takes over.
[1:21:34.060 --> 1:21:35.860]  And that's what we're experiencing right now.
[1:21:35.860 --> 1:21:40.540]  Here's just some of the latest headlines at infowars.com.
[1:21:40.540 --> 1:21:46.380]  Secretary Secretary Yellen to discuss freezing Russian gold reserves.
[1:21:46.380 --> 1:21:52.020]  I mean, folks, this is just crazy.
[1:21:52.020 --> 1:22:01.340]  Russia wants to bring back a gold standard and Russia has a lot of gold and so does China.
[1:22:01.340 --> 1:22:03.460]  And they're looking to get out of the petrodollar.
[1:22:03.460 --> 1:22:08.980]  They're looking to get out of the U.S. as the world's reserve currency, the U.S. dollar.
[1:22:08.980 --> 1:22:13.940]  And so China and Russia's massive gold reserve is going to be part of that process.
[1:22:13.940 --> 1:22:18.020]  And so now the Fed is trying to figure out how they can stop that from happening.
[1:22:18.020 --> 1:22:23.620]  You know, you can sit here and say Putin is a bad guy or Zelensky is a bad guy or whatever.
[1:22:23.620 --> 1:22:24.620]  They're not your problem.
[1:22:24.620 --> 1:22:26.260]  Your problem is Janet Yellen.
[1:22:26.260 --> 1:22:28.580]  Your problem is Joe Biden.
[1:22:28.580 --> 1:22:30.020]  Your problem is Jen Psaki.
[1:22:30.020 --> 1:22:31.660]  Your problem is the Democrat Party.
[1:22:31.660 --> 1:22:37.700]  Your problem is the corrupt Republicans.
[1:22:37.700 --> 1:22:39.660]  It's just unbelievable.
[1:22:39.660 --> 1:22:47.080]  So you know, I really think, I mean, it's basically Putin versus the entire New World
[1:22:47.080 --> 1:22:48.780]  Order right now.
[1:22:48.780 --> 1:22:53.300]  And you're going to see Saudi Arabia and the UAE definitely probably join forces and you'll
[1:22:53.300 --> 1:22:56.660]  have smaller countries like Belarus and others join forces.
[1:22:56.660 --> 1:23:02.060]  Mexico and Brazil may start getting involved down the line, too.
[1:23:02.060 --> 1:23:04.300]  But that's what it is, folks.
[1:23:04.300 --> 1:23:05.380]  Maybe Putin's a bad guy.
[1:23:05.380 --> 1:23:06.380]  Maybe he's a good guy.
[1:23:06.380 --> 1:23:07.380]  It's relevant.
[1:23:07.380 --> 1:23:08.860]  It's relevant to the entire New World Order.
[1:23:08.860 --> 1:23:10.100]  And he's on a suicide mission.
[1:23:10.100 --> 1:23:11.460]  He knows they want to kill him.
[1:23:11.460 --> 1:23:14.740]  He knows that this whole thing might start World War III.
[1:23:14.740 --> 1:23:19.920]  But he figures, you know what, if this is the fight to stop all Russians from becoming
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:27.180]  slaves to the Bilderberg group, then I'm willing to take that chance.
[1:23:27.180 --> 1:23:30.500]  And that's what's going on.
[1:23:30.500 --> 1:23:35.220]  Meet Flation expected to remain stubbornly high after midterms or ahead of midterms.
[1:23:35.220 --> 1:23:39.580]  Yes, this is part of the great reset, pricing you out of meat so that you have to eat the
[1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:40.580]  bugs.
[1:23:40.580 --> 1:23:43.340]  It's good for you, you know.
[1:23:43.340 --> 1:23:45.220]  These liberal globalists, they love you so much.
[1:23:45.220 --> 1:23:49.180]  They don't even want you to eat steak and have pets, don't you know?
[1:23:49.180 --> 1:23:53.340]  Capital riot suspect receives asylum in Belarus.
[1:23:53.340 --> 1:23:56.980]  Yeah.
[1:23:56.980 --> 1:23:59.500]  Don't be surprised, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:05.700]  Do not be surprised if similar stories don't start popping up here and there because what
[1:24:05.700 --> 1:24:08.620]  are you going to do when you're a political prisoner of the Democrat Party and you get
[1:24:08.620 --> 1:24:09.620]  tortured?
[1:24:09.620 --> 1:24:15.060]  Do you really want to have the fate of Joe Biggs breaks my heart?
[1:24:15.060 --> 1:24:20.820]  Do you really want to have the fate of Joe Biggs who walked into the Capitol on January
[1:24:20.820 --> 1:24:26.580]  6th at most should probably be dealing with a trespassing charge who's now spent a year
[1:24:26.580 --> 1:24:31.460]  in jail and is now in a 30-day solitary confinement lockdown?
[1:24:31.460 --> 1:24:32.900]  Who knows if he'll ever get out again?
[1:24:32.900 --> 1:24:33.900]  Who knows?
[1:24:33.900 --> 1:24:44.060]  They may just kill him in there.
[1:24:44.060 --> 1:24:46.500]  It's just sad, man.
[1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:52.140]  It's just unbelievable how much evil we're facing.
[1:24:52.140 --> 1:24:59.820]  And so, yeah, what are Americans going to do that are facing the fate of Joe Biggs?
[1:24:59.820 --> 1:25:05.500]  A year in jail and now 30-day solitary confinement being tortured throughout the process.
[1:25:05.500 --> 1:25:08.300]  You think that other people, other January 6th defendants are just going to sit here
[1:25:08.300 --> 1:25:11.700]  and wait to face that same fate?
[1:25:11.700 --> 1:25:15.820]  Or do you think they're going to start looking for other countries for asylum like Russia
[1:25:15.820 --> 1:25:17.580]  or Belarus?
[1:25:17.580 --> 1:25:20.180]  Where did Edward Snowden go?
[1:25:20.180 --> 1:25:24.060]  Where is he still today?
[1:25:24.060 --> 1:25:30.140]  Used car prices fall as Goldman points out supply chain alleviation.
[1:25:30.140 --> 1:25:33.620]  I'm not so sure that's going to stick around.
[1:25:33.620 --> 1:25:36.540]  Most new cars are not even getting to lots.
[1:25:36.540 --> 1:25:38.140]  They're still in the process of being built.
[1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:40.500]  They're still a massive supply chain shortage.
[1:25:40.500 --> 1:25:43.500]  And you know, it's already so ridiculous.
[1:25:43.500 --> 1:25:46.060]  They already have this gas guzzler text.
[1:25:46.060 --> 1:25:49.940]  If you buy a combustion engine vehicle, you pay $2,000 to the government.
[1:25:49.940 --> 1:25:58.100]  I mean, just straight up blatant theft.
[1:25:58.100 --> 1:26:00.840]  You buy a car that runs on gas.
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:03.180]  You pay $2,000 to the government.
[1:26:03.180 --> 1:26:09.060]  It's called a gas guzzler text, criminal, robbery.
[1:26:09.060 --> 1:26:11.380]  All right.
[1:26:11.380 --> 1:26:16.580]  I am excited to see the liberal left's response to this.
[1:26:16.580 --> 1:26:18.340]  This is an ongoing situation, by the way.
[1:26:18.340 --> 1:26:19.340]  This isn't new.
[1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:25.340]  There's nothing going on for the entire time Russia's been going into Ukraine.
[1:26:25.340 --> 1:26:27.220]  Ukraine blocks trans woman refugees.
[1:26:27.220 --> 1:26:28.220]  They are men.
[1:26:28.220 --> 1:26:29.980]  They must go back and fight.
[1:26:29.980 --> 1:26:31.820]  Oh, ouch.
[1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:35.820]  Can we still support Ukraine, even though they're so bigoted that they don't believe
[1:26:35.820 --> 1:26:38.220]  men or women?
[1:26:38.220 --> 1:26:40.580]  Curious how the liberals feel about this.
[1:26:40.580 --> 1:26:45.860]  Can you still support a bigoted Ukraine that believes men are women?
[1:26:45.860 --> 1:26:53.700]  Must be tough to live with the intellectual double think, the illogical double think of
[1:26:53.700 --> 1:26:57.300]  being a liberal must be tough.
[1:26:57.300 --> 1:26:58.820]  No wonder you're so messed up.
[1:26:58.820 --> 1:27:00.540]  No wonder you're such basket cases.
[1:27:00.540 --> 1:27:07.580]  No wonder you're such mentally depraved psychotics because you're lost in a world that doesn't
[1:27:07.580 --> 1:27:21.500]  exist, where we now nominate Dingbat morons like Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court who
[1:27:21.500 --> 1:27:31.980]  protects pedophiles, I mean, do you understand that she had a case in front of her?
[1:27:31.980 --> 1:27:38.260]  Judge Jackson had a pedophile case in front of her where the case, the law, the government
[1:27:38.260 --> 1:27:42.140]  says you should get 72 months in prison.
[1:27:42.140 --> 1:27:47.580]  The prosecution said that the criminal should get 28 months and she gave that person three
[1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:48.580]  months.
[1:27:48.580 --> 1:27:54.380]  72 months, Jackson put a pedophile in jail for three months.
[1:27:54.380 --> 1:28:02.060]  So I'm saying, man, it's like I don't even know how to deal with this anymore.
[1:28:02.060 --> 1:28:03.860]  It's all so insane.
[1:28:03.860 --> 1:28:10.300]  It's all so obvious and it's like if my fellow men and women can't wake up and get on this
[1:28:10.300 --> 1:28:17.180]  same level of common sense as me, I mean, there's a certain survival instinct, folks.
[1:28:17.180 --> 1:28:21.780]  There's a certain survival instinct you've got to get as far away from these psychotics
[1:28:21.780 --> 1:28:24.620]  as possible.
[1:28:24.620 --> 1:28:28.780]  Anybody that protects pedophiles or wants to mutilate children's genitals, I mean, that's
[1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:34.500]  like run for the hills.
[1:28:34.500 --> 1:28:39.380]  That's that's run for the hills and they're taking over, you're like, hey, what's that
[1:28:39.380 --> 1:28:40.380]  noise?
[1:28:40.380 --> 1:28:43.620]  Oh, it's a pedophile army coming to take over your town.
[1:28:43.620 --> 1:28:44.620]  Really?
[1:28:44.620 --> 1:28:47.220]  Yeah, you're going to stick around?
[1:28:47.220 --> 1:28:52.940]  Hey, there's a bunch of communists coming to destroy your community, really?
[1:28:52.940 --> 1:28:55.260]  Are you going to stick around for that?
[1:28:55.260 --> 1:29:25.220]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:29:25.220 --> 1:29:42.580]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:29:42.580 --> 1:29:59.940]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:29:59.940 --> 1:30:17.300]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:30:17.300 --> 1:30:34.660]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:30:34.660 --> 1:30:58.460]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:30:58.460 --> 1:31:15.820]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:31:15.820 --> 1:31:39.180]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:31:39.180 --> 1:31:56.540]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:31:56.540 --> 1:32:13.900]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:32:13.900 --> 1:32:37.260]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:32:37.260 --> 1:33:03.660]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:33:03.660 --> 1:33:33.500]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:33:33.500 --> 1:33:50.860]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:33:50.860 --> 1:34:14.220]  Or are you going to get the hell out of dodge, or are you going to get the hell out of dodge?
[1:34:14.220 --> 1:34:21.580]  You see, that's what's so frustrating about this is that when you live in reality and
[1:34:21.580 --> 1:34:27.740]  you just know how the world works and you just have basic geopolitical knowledge and domestic
[1:34:27.740 --> 1:34:33.340]  political knowledge, you see the lives of the mainstream news and you're just stunned but
[1:34:33.340 --> 1:34:38.980]  then you see how the public just buys all of it up, just lops up the propaganda like
[1:34:38.980 --> 1:34:44.940]  a pig in slop, it's just stunning.
[1:34:44.940 --> 1:34:50.300]  And see the first response is you assume these people would want to be informed, you assume
[1:34:50.300 --> 1:34:54.500]  these people would want to know the truth, like you, they don't folks, they don't want
[1:34:54.500 --> 1:34:56.380]  to know the truth.
[1:34:56.380 --> 1:35:03.580]  They like being lied to because in their eyes they view the lies as a political advantage
[1:35:03.580 --> 1:35:05.420]  for themselves.
[1:35:05.420 --> 1:35:09.660]  So they go along with all the lies, they know they can't have an actual intellectual discussion
[1:35:09.660 --> 1:35:13.900]  or an intellectual debate or a policy debate or show how their policies or ideologies are
[1:35:13.900 --> 1:35:19.580]  successful, so they buy all the lies and sell all the lies because it's the only way they
[1:35:19.580 --> 1:35:23.060]  can continue to exist politically.
[1:35:23.060 --> 1:35:24.060]  So here you go.
[1:35:24.060 --> 1:35:30.020]  I mean, let's just spend a whole segment covering mainstream news articles.
[1:35:30.020 --> 1:35:37.660]  I mean, the last thing, one of the last things they voted on in Congress during the Obama
[1:35:37.660 --> 1:35:43.380]  administration was to continue funding neo-Nazis.
[1:35:43.380 --> 1:35:45.780]  I'm not even kidding you.
[1:35:45.780 --> 1:35:53.180]  2016, one of the last things in that Congress with Obama was are we going to continue funding
[1:35:53.180 --> 1:35:57.140]  neo-Nazis in Ukraine on the docket?
[1:35:57.140 --> 1:35:59.300]  And then four years later they say they don't exist.
[1:35:59.300 --> 1:36:09.540]  Well, they do exist, and here's all you liars covering their existence for the last 20 years.
[1:36:09.540 --> 1:36:15.340]  So I have to do my best here not to get frustrated at the constant lying from these people, but
[1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:16.780]  it's getting harder every day.
[1:36:16.780 --> 1:36:19.820]  So here we go.
[1:36:19.820 --> 1:36:26.500]  Now here's just a basic screen grab of all the different headlines, all the different
[1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:34.460]  sources, Western media before February 2022, and it's all of them covering the neo-Nazis
[1:36:34.460 --> 1:36:35.460]  in Ukraine.
[1:36:35.460 --> 1:36:39.620]  So we'll just go through this whole stack of news here until you get the point.
[1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:43.380]  And then you can show this to your friends and family that think Ukraine is the good
[1:36:43.380 --> 1:36:46.940]  guys and think Putin's lying about getting the Nazis out of Ukraine.
[1:36:46.940 --> 1:36:48.620]  Nope, he's being honest about that.
[1:36:48.620 --> 1:36:51.180]  Turns out everything Putin says is all real.
[1:36:51.180 --> 1:36:54.420]  It's all true.
[1:36:54.420 --> 1:36:56.220]  Except I guess when he said he wasn't going to invade Ukraine.
[1:36:56.220 --> 1:36:57.700]  I guess that's the one line.
[1:36:57.700 --> 1:37:04.180]  Ukraine celebrates Nazi collaborator, bans book critical of programs leader, times of
[1:37:04.180 --> 1:37:06.180]  Israel.
[1:37:06.180 --> 1:37:10.980]  Ukraine, I guess when I get the date, I'll give you the date too.
[1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:12.620]  Not all of these are dated.
[1:37:12.620 --> 1:37:17.900]  Ukraine makes birthday of Nazi collaborator, a national holiday, and bans book critical
[1:37:17.900 --> 1:37:21.100]  of anti-Semitic leader.
[1:37:21.100 --> 1:37:27.340]  Newsweek, 2018, far right militias in Europe plan to confront Russian forces, a research
[1:37:27.340 --> 1:37:34.900]  group says, and it's all about the Ukrainian Azov battalion, the Nazis that they're going
[1:37:34.900 --> 1:37:38.020]  to confront.
[1:37:38.020 --> 1:37:42.020]  Azov fighters are Ukraine's greatest weapon and maybe its greatest threat.
[1:37:42.020 --> 1:37:48.340]  The Guardian, 2014, covering the neo-Nazi army group.
[1:37:48.340 --> 1:37:51.460]  Ukraine designates national holiday to commemorate Nazi collaborator.
[1:37:51.460 --> 1:37:55.460]  They literally celebrate Nazis in Ukraine.
[1:37:55.460 --> 1:38:00.940]  Neo-Nazi groups recruit Brits to fight in Ukraine.
[1:38:00.940 --> 1:38:02.940]  That's the Guardian, 2018.
[1:38:02.940 --> 1:38:14.540]  Now, by the way, just to sidestep this and bring some other news to this, British individuals,
[1:38:14.540 --> 1:38:17.300]  American individuals, and others who have been tricked into going to fight this war
[1:38:17.300 --> 1:38:21.020]  for Ukraine are actually realizing they've been lied to.
[1:38:21.020 --> 1:38:28.300]  Here was an individual that posted this on 4chan, I think it is.
[1:38:28.300 --> 1:38:33.580]  I guess I fell for the Azov meme, recently graduated with no jobs, so I decided to fly
[1:38:33.580 --> 1:38:36.420]  over to Germany and then take a bus to the border of Ukraine.
[1:38:36.420 --> 1:38:40.500]  I told them I wanted to join Azov battalion and they put me in this unorganized foreign
[1:38:40.500 --> 1:38:43.500]  unit with a couple other Americans and mostly British guys.
[1:38:43.500 --> 1:38:48.620]  We did Jack for the first few days, but flash forward to now and they sent us to the southwest
[1:38:48.620 --> 1:38:55.060]  edge of Kiev with nothing but M9 pistols and an AK-47 with half a clip if you're lucky.
[1:38:55.060 --> 1:38:59.100]  We are basically going to be human meat shields for the actual trained Ukraine forces.
[1:38:59.100 --> 1:39:04.180]  I hear gunshots and artillery less than a mile away.
[1:39:04.180 --> 1:39:06.860]  I was lied to and now I'm going to probably get killed.
[1:39:06.860 --> 1:39:09.420]  Now, what did I say a month ago when all this happened?
[1:39:09.420 --> 1:39:13.300]  I said, don't be tricked into becoming a human shield for the new world order.
[1:39:13.300 --> 1:39:16.340]  Don't be tricked into becoming a human shield for the Biden administration.
[1:39:16.340 --> 1:39:20.300]  Don't be tricked into becoming a human shield for the great reset.
[1:39:20.300 --> 1:39:24.340]  And then Putin said the exact same thing and now the people that went over there to volunteer
[1:39:24.340 --> 1:39:30.740]  to fight for Ukraine are realizing that's exactly what they got tricked into doing.
[1:39:30.740 --> 1:39:37.340]  We go on, Washington Post, neo-Nazis are exploiting Russia's war in Ukraine for their own purposes.
[1:39:37.340 --> 1:39:41.060]  Oh, I thought they didn't exist.
[1:39:41.060 --> 1:39:49.980]  The week, Brits joined neo-Nazi militia in Ukraine, 2018.
[1:39:49.980 --> 1:39:56.460]  Russia steps up pressure on Ukraine to disarm our right neo-Nazi groups, Moscow Times.
[1:39:56.460 --> 1:40:00.900]  Russia says Ukraine clash shows Kiev not disarming militants.
[1:40:00.900 --> 1:40:10.980]  That's Yahoo News 2014, the militants they're discussing, the neo-Nazi groups.
[1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:16.140]  And so, I mean, folks, it just goes on and on and on.
[1:40:16.140 --> 1:40:23.540]  New glory to Ukraine army chant invokes nationalist past, yeah, the nationalist of their neo-Nazis.
[1:40:23.540 --> 1:40:29.420]  2014, BBC, Ukraine underplays role of far right and conflict.
[1:40:29.420 --> 1:40:30.420]  What far right?
[1:40:30.420 --> 1:40:33.780]  Oh, the neo-Nazis they're discussing, which Nazis are actually leftists, folks.
[1:40:33.780 --> 1:40:36.820]  I mean, a socialist is that's left.
[1:40:36.820 --> 1:40:37.820]  So it's not right.
[1:40:37.820 --> 1:40:39.620]  A socialism is a left thing.
[1:40:39.620 --> 1:40:46.860]  So stop sitting here saying, oh, Nazis are far right, no, Nazis are left.
[1:40:46.860 --> 1:40:54.020]  Socialism is a left-wing concept, just yet another lie, another lie of the mainstream
[1:40:54.020 --> 1:40:59.380]  media, another lie of the liberal left, another lie of the progressive Democrats.
[1:40:59.380 --> 1:41:01.660]  Socialism is a left-wing concept.
[1:41:01.660 --> 1:41:09.100]  So if you're gonna be mad about Nazis, you need to be mad about your own political ideology.
[1:41:09.100 --> 1:41:13.860]  And I'm not even gonna sit here and say Nazis are representative of socialism or not.
[1:41:13.860 --> 1:41:21.020]  I'm just saying to sit here and say Nazis are far right is an intellectual ideological
[1:41:21.020 --> 1:41:24.300]  lie and falsehood.
[1:41:24.300 --> 1:41:27.340]  Socialism is an idea of the left.
[1:41:27.340 --> 1:41:28.860]  Nazism is socialism.
[1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:30.580]  So Nazis are left-wing groups.
[1:41:30.580 --> 1:41:32.580]  Let's get it right.
[1:41:32.580 --> 1:41:36.900]  I mean, folks, I can sit here and just go through this news all day long.
[1:41:36.900 --> 1:41:43.340]  The point is, they were all covering, look at this, Ukraine conflict, child soldiers
[1:41:43.340 --> 1:41:44.340]  joined the fight.
[1:41:44.340 --> 1:41:47.540]  You know those videos you see of the little kids posing with the Nazi flags that the left
[1:41:47.540 --> 1:41:48.540]  is celebrating?
[1:41:48.540 --> 1:41:50.020]  Yeah, they've been doing that.
[1:41:50.020 --> 1:41:56.820]  The neo-Nazi groups, the left-wing neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine have been using children
[1:41:56.820 --> 1:41:59.020]  and the left-wing in America celebrates it.
[1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:00.500]  See that's what I'm saying.
[1:42:00.500 --> 1:42:02.180]  There is no logic on the left.
[1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:03.420]  It's all illogic.
[1:42:03.420 --> 1:42:08.020]  They claim Putin is an oppressive dictator and wants to bring back the Soviet Union.
[1:42:08.020 --> 1:42:09.020]  Okay, so what is that?
[1:42:09.020 --> 1:42:12.300]  So Putin's censors free speech, Putin wants communism.
[1:42:12.300 --> 1:42:13.700]  That's what the left-wing in America does.
[1:42:13.700 --> 1:42:15.780]  You should be celebrating that.
[1:42:15.780 --> 1:42:17.520]  Nazis want socialism.
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:18.900]  You celebrate socialism.
[1:42:18.900 --> 1:42:22.500]  So all of this stuff you claim to be fighting is your own ideology.
[1:42:22.500 --> 1:42:29.060]  Now you lie about Putin, so that's a different thing, but all this crap is your own ideology.
[1:42:29.060 --> 1:42:32.460]  Nazism, socialism, that's a left-wing concept.
[1:42:32.460 --> 1:42:36.660]  Optimism, oppression, censoring free speech, that's a left-wing concept.
[1:42:36.660 --> 1:42:42.860]  I didn't even get through half the stack of news, folks, but you get the point.
[1:42:42.860 --> 1:42:45.740]  Everything you've been told about Ukraine is pretty much a lie.
[1:42:45.740 --> 1:42:51.140]  The left-wing in America are the true Nazis, the true oppressors, and the true villains,
[1:42:51.140 --> 1:42:54.660]  and the sooner we realize that and stand against it, the sooner we can probably save this planet
[1:42:54.660 --> 1:42:57.900]  in this country.

[1:46:30.780 --> 1:46:31.780]  reaction.
[1:46:31.780 --> 1:46:33.780]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[1:46:33.780 --> 1:46:34.780]  I have a few ideas.
[1:46:34.780 --> 1:46:39.420]  First of all, Alpha Power has just released a form, a rest valve, a rest valve swap.
[1:46:39.420 --> 1:46:40.420]  The vaccine is poison.
[1:46:40.420 --> 1:46:41.420]  There's tons of things.
[1:46:41.420 --> 1:46:43.420]  I'd say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[1:46:43.420 --> 1:46:44.420]  I agree.
[1:46:44.420 --> 1:46:47.420]  A rest valve sheet, a rest bill gates, the COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[1:46:47.420 --> 1:46:48.420]  Beautiful.
[1:46:48.420 --> 1:46:51.420]  The reason we could all be involved is that we could all be affected, so that's what
[1:46:51.420 --> 1:46:52.420]  I'm calling about.
[1:46:52.420 --> 1:46:53.420]  God bless you, Chris.
[1:46:53.420 --> 1:46:56.420]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[1:46:56.420 --> 1:46:59.420]  Thank you so much.
[1:46:59.420 --> 1:47:24.420]  Thank you.
[1:47:29.420 --> 1:47:42.460]  I have unbelievable clips from day three of the Judge Jackson hearing, where she is now
[1:47:42.460 --> 1:47:48.380]  openly making excuses for why she protects pedophiles, and it is incredible.
[1:47:48.380 --> 1:47:55.140]  If this woman is still nominated to the Supreme Court after all of this, we're just a fallen
[1:47:55.140 --> 1:47:56.640]  nation, folks.
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:03.180]  We're just a fallen nation.
[1:48:03.180 --> 1:48:06.580]  I just can't even deal, man.
[1:48:06.580 --> 1:48:13.500]  You've got the Democrat nominee for the Supreme Court defending her defense of pedophiles.
[1:48:13.500 --> 1:48:19.020]  I'm saying, I can't do this seriously anymore.
[1:48:19.020 --> 1:48:25.500]  I have to switch my mindset into straight comedy, because this is ridiculous.
[1:48:25.500 --> 1:48:33.340]  The only response to this is to get flagrantly pissed off, but I don't want to sit here and
[1:48:33.340 --> 1:48:40.740]  just be an angry, ranting, red-faced blood vessels popping out of my neck yelling at
[1:48:40.740 --> 1:48:49.300]  you all day long, but I don't know how else you cover the media lying to you about the
[1:48:49.300 --> 1:48:50.300]  Hunter Biden laptop.
[1:48:50.300 --> 1:48:59.380]  I mean, folks, you understand, you understand that there's photos of Hunter Biden engaging
[1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:07.020]  in lewd sexual acts with what appear to be minors, and it's rumored to be his own family.
[1:49:07.020 --> 1:49:12.660]  You have text messages that have been taken from Hunter Biden's laptop, because I guess
[1:49:12.660 --> 1:49:15.780]  it was just queued up, synced up with his iPhone.
[1:49:15.780 --> 1:49:21.060]  A lot of people probably know about that, they sync up their messages, where it talks
[1:49:21.060 --> 1:49:30.060]  about him having sexual relations with Natalie Biden, who was a minor at the time.
[1:49:30.060 --> 1:49:36.780]  And so I see this stuff, and I don't even want to dig deeper.
[1:49:36.780 --> 1:49:45.220]  I don't want to know why Ashley Biden is writing about Joe getting in the shower with her and
[1:49:45.220 --> 1:49:47.020]  molesting her.
[1:49:47.020 --> 1:49:50.300]  I'll just, I'll cover that at face value and you decide.
[1:49:50.300 --> 1:49:55.300]  I don't want to know why Hunter Biden is sending messages to family members saying,
[1:49:55.300 --> 1:50:00.540]  hey, don't go in front of counselors and tell them about my inappropriate sexual acts with
[1:50:00.540 --> 1:50:04.100]  minors and my own minor family members.
[1:50:04.100 --> 1:50:12.380]  I don't want to come on air, and in my own time, preparing for the show, show you the
[1:50:12.380 --> 1:50:19.340]  hundreds of images from Hunter Biden's laptop of him abusing drugs, engaging in sexual acts,
[1:50:19.340 --> 1:50:23.140]  and some of these with what clearly appear to be minors and it's rumored to be his own
[1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:24.820]  family.
[1:50:24.820 --> 1:50:30.820]  And then you read the Biden diary about Joe getting in the shower and molesting his daughter,
[1:50:30.820 --> 1:50:34.540]  and you read the Hunter Biden text messages saying, please don't talk to counselors about
[1:50:34.540 --> 1:50:36.740]  my inappropriate sexual relations with minors.
[1:50:36.740 --> 1:50:41.540]  I mean, what am I supposed to think about that?
[1:50:41.540 --> 1:50:44.220]  And the media just says, oh, it's all Russian disinformation.
[1:50:44.220 --> 1:50:45.220]  It doesn't exist.
[1:50:45.220 --> 1:50:46.540]  It's not real.
[1:50:46.540 --> 1:50:50.740]  And then Biden gets into office and then a year later they say, okay, the laptop is real.
[1:50:50.740 --> 1:50:56.740]  We lied to you.
[1:50:56.740 --> 1:51:01.540]  This country is in free fall, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:51:01.540 --> 1:51:06.040]  We are in free fall and we really don't even have a president.
[1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:09.100]  We really don't even have a White House administration.
[1:51:09.100 --> 1:51:18.700]  We've got a bunch of goons and cheerleaders and criminals and pedophiles posing as American
[1:51:18.700 --> 1:51:19.700]  leaders.
[1:51:19.700 --> 1:51:21.620]  They're not.
[1:51:21.620 --> 1:51:22.620]  They're all blackmailed.
[1:51:22.620 --> 1:51:27.380]  They're all compromised or they're just complete brainwashed morons.
[1:51:27.380 --> 1:51:33.340]  And then your head is still spinning from dealing with that and you're like, oh, okay.
[1:51:33.340 --> 1:51:35.780]  And you finally, your vision is clear again.
[1:51:35.780 --> 1:51:37.900]  You've stopped spinning and then, okay, you're able to focus.
[1:51:37.900 --> 1:51:39.540]  And what do you see?
[1:51:39.540 --> 1:51:54.660]  Judge Jackson explaining why she protects pedophiles and you're like, what, wait, Joe Biden
[1:51:54.660 --> 1:51:56.540]  selected a pedophile protecting judge.
[1:51:56.540 --> 1:52:01.620]  That's what she's known for to put her on the Supreme Court.
[1:52:01.620 --> 1:52:05.300]  This can't be a coincidence.
[1:52:05.300 --> 1:52:07.180]  By the way, I just sent the crew the new clip.
[1:52:07.180 --> 1:52:11.740]  Do we, do we have that clip ready to go guys?
[1:52:11.740 --> 1:52:16.740]  Here is Lindsey Graham.
[1:52:16.740 --> 1:52:17.740]  This is just unbelievable.
[1:52:17.740 --> 1:52:22.900]  I mean, I just, I don't even know how to properly, here's, here's the nominee for the Supreme
[1:52:22.900 --> 1:52:28.900]  Court defending her defense of pedophiles.
[1:52:28.900 --> 1:52:32.300]  Here you go.
[1:52:32.300 --> 1:52:34.820]  In comes the internet.
[1:52:34.820 --> 1:52:43.260]  On the internet with one click, you can receive, you can distribute tens of thousands.
[1:52:43.260 --> 1:52:46.780]  You can be doing this for 15 minutes.
[1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:53.500]  And all of a sudden you are looking at 30, 40, 50 years in prison.
[1:52:53.500 --> 1:52:54.500]  Good.
[1:52:54.500 --> 1:52:55.500]  Good.
[1:52:55.500 --> 1:52:56.500]  I understand.
[1:52:56.500 --> 1:52:57.500]  Absolutely good.
[1:52:57.500 --> 1:52:58.500]  I hope you are.
[1:52:58.500 --> 1:52:59.500]  Good.
[1:52:59.500 --> 1:53:00.500]  Allow her to finish, please.
[1:53:00.500 --> 1:53:02.020]  I hope you go to jail for 50 years.
[1:53:02.020 --> 1:53:03.020]  Yeah, please.
[1:53:03.020 --> 1:53:05.020]  Let her keep talking.
[1:53:05.020 --> 1:53:06.020]  Let her keep talking.
[1:53:06.020 --> 1:53:07.020]  In sexual exploitation.
[1:53:07.020 --> 1:53:09.180]  See, you don't think that's a bad thing.
[1:53:09.180 --> 1:53:10.180]  I think that's a horrible thing.
[1:53:10.180 --> 1:53:13.380]  That's not what the witness said and she should be alive.
[1:53:13.380 --> 1:53:15.180]  And there's Dick Durbin defending her again.
[1:53:15.180 --> 1:53:18.340]  You know, you got to wonder what's going on with Dick Durbin.
[1:53:18.340 --> 1:53:21.780]  Why does Dick Durbin love this pedophile protector so much?
[1:53:21.780 --> 1:53:23.580]  What does Dick Durbin do in his free time?
[1:53:23.580 --> 1:53:24.900]  I don't think I'd like to know.
[1:53:24.900 --> 1:53:29.460]  But see, look, if you're being rational about this and, and hey, this is a fair debate to
[1:53:29.460 --> 1:53:30.460]  have.
[1:53:30.460 --> 1:53:33.980]  There's no real adult discussions about this.
[1:53:33.980 --> 1:53:42.460]  I can understand the logic of saying, hey, if you, if you're on the internet and you're,
[1:53:42.460 --> 1:53:47.220]  you're browsing through a pornography site or the dark web or whatever.
[1:53:47.220 --> 1:53:53.580]  And let's say unintentionally or by mistake somehow, you end up with illicit images or
[1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:57.180]  lewd images or God forbid videos of child rape, which is all this is.
[1:53:57.180 --> 1:53:58.620]  There's no such thing as child pornography.
[1:53:58.620 --> 1:54:00.380]  It's all child rape.
[1:54:00.380 --> 1:54:04.460]  And let's say there's maybe one or two or God forbid, even three instances where this
[1:54:04.460 --> 1:54:07.100]  happens to you.
[1:54:07.100 --> 1:54:11.020]  And like you said, oh, it happens in 15 minutes and you're in a court of law and you say, look,
[1:54:11.020 --> 1:54:12.180]  I'm not about this.
[1:54:12.180 --> 1:54:13.180]  I did this accidentally.
[1:54:13.180 --> 1:54:14.500]  I didn't share it with anybody.
[1:54:14.500 --> 1:54:22.100]  I didn't, okay, then maybe you understand, all right, the federal statute here for your
[1:54:22.100 --> 1:54:25.180]  child rape videos is 72 months.
[1:54:25.180 --> 1:54:27.620]  But you know what, you made a mistake.
[1:54:27.620 --> 1:54:29.620]  This clearly is not a pattern of behavior.
[1:54:29.620 --> 1:54:33.420]  Then maybe you can say, well, okay, we'll give you a lighter sentence.
[1:54:33.420 --> 1:54:36.740]  That's not the case here, folks.
[1:54:36.740 --> 1:54:44.700]  Judge Jackson reduced the sentences of pedophiles that took sexual images of their own children
[1:54:44.700 --> 1:54:47.220]  and sent them to people on the internet.
[1:54:47.220 --> 1:54:52.620]  People that had hundreds and thousands of files on their computers of child rape that
[1:54:52.620 --> 1:54:54.780]  they then sent to other people.
[1:54:54.780 --> 1:54:58.380]  That's a pattern of behavior, seriously.
[1:54:58.380 --> 1:55:04.620]  I mean, five years in prison should be like the bare minimum.
[1:55:04.620 --> 1:55:10.020]  If you have a pattern of behavior of watching and sharing and distributing and producing
[1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:20.180]  child rape videos, I mean, 10 years minimum, I mean, that's a joke, man.
[1:55:20.180 --> 1:55:21.460]  That's a joke.
[1:55:21.460 --> 1:55:29.660]  But in Judge Jackson's world, in the Democrat world, if you stood on the wrong piece of cement
[1:55:29.660 --> 1:55:34.380]  in D.C. on January 6th, you should never get out of jail.
[1:55:34.380 --> 1:55:39.940]  But if you rape your own daughter and you take pictures and videos of that rape and
[1:55:39.940 --> 1:55:44.060]  you distribute that to people and you have other child rape videos that you distribute
[1:55:44.060 --> 1:55:47.780]  to people, eh, you should maybe get a couple months max.
[1:55:47.780 --> 1:55:53.380]  Judge Jackson, baby, that's the Democrats and they defend it.
[1:55:53.380 --> 1:55:57.220]  And they defend it.
[1:55:57.220 --> 1:56:00.220]  Where are we going?
[1:56:00.220 --> 1:56:03.020]  What are we doing?
[1:56:03.020 --> 1:56:10.300]  But you watch, this is truly a pivotal moment in American history, folks, and I would bet
[1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:15.060]  I'd still lean on the side if I'm betting that Judge Jackson does get confirmed.
[1:56:15.060 --> 1:56:23.820]  Oh, I will say, the Republicans are doing a good job exposing this pro-pedophile judge.
[1:56:23.820 --> 1:56:27.340]  And that definitely, I think, legitimately hurts her chances of being confirmed, but
[1:56:27.340 --> 1:56:29.100]  I would still bet she gets confirmed.
[1:56:29.100 --> 1:56:35.160]  So this is an important moment in American history, and it's not really living up to
[1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:45.700]  its own historical, I would say its own historical prowess here because the media doesn't want
[1:56:45.700 --> 1:56:48.020]  you to know that this woman protects pedophiles.
[1:56:48.020 --> 1:56:52.540]  They just want you to know it's a black woman and so you have to love her and support her.
[1:56:52.540 --> 1:56:56.140]  Sure she protects pedophiles and a pro-pedophile judge, but that's not important.
[1:56:56.140 --> 1:56:58.100]  What's important is she's a black woman.
[1:56:58.100 --> 1:57:01.980]  And so what needs to happen next, they already got her with the can you define a woman thing
[1:57:01.980 --> 1:57:04.440]  and she says no.
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:09.060]  So if a woman doesn't exist, why are you celebrating the first black woman being nominated?
[1:57:09.060 --> 1:57:12.540]  What the next big gotcha question needs to be from one of these Republicans, I hope somebody
[1:57:12.540 --> 1:57:13.740]  gets this message to them.
[1:57:13.740 --> 1:57:15.180]  I'm surprised it hasn't been asked yet.
[1:57:15.180 --> 1:57:16.180]  Maybe it will be.
[1:57:16.180 --> 1:57:21.060]  Let's just ask Judge Jackson, how do you feel that the only reason you were selected for
[1:57:21.060 --> 1:57:23.980]  this position is because of your skin color?
[1:57:23.980 --> 1:57:27.700]  How do you feel that the only reason you've been selected to this position is because
[1:57:27.700 --> 1:57:29.420]  of your gender and your skin color?
[1:57:29.420 --> 1:57:33.020]  I would love to hear her response to that.
[1:57:33.020 --> 1:57:35.540]  So we've already got her as a pedophile protector.
[1:57:35.540 --> 1:57:38.900]  We've already got her that she won't even admit that women are women.
[1:57:38.900 --> 1:57:43.100]  Now let's get her response to what it feels like to only be nominated because of her skin
[1:57:43.100 --> 1:57:44.100]  color.
[1:57:44.100 --> 1:57:47.980]  Now that, that would be fun.
[1:57:47.980 --> 1:57:49.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[1:57:49.860 --> 1:57:53.300]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[1:57:53.300 --> 1:57:57.300]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:57:57.300 --> 1:57:58.500]  I was born for this.
[1:57:58.500 --> 1:58:02.940]  You were born for this and people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[1:58:02.940 --> 1:58:07.940]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions
[1:58:07.940 --> 1:58:08.940]  of dollars.
[1:58:08.940 --> 1:58:13.300]  And now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[1:58:13.300 --> 1:58:19.260]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[1:58:19.260 --> 1:58:20.260]  of charge.
[1:58:20.260 --> 1:58:25.020]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[1:58:25.020 --> 1:58:29.500]  Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[1:58:29.500 --> 1:58:30.500]  movement worldwide.
[1:58:30.500 --> 1:58:36.220]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[1:58:36.220 --> 1:58:37.660]  of thousands of dollars a month.
[1:58:37.660 --> 1:58:40.740]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.
[1:58:40.740 --> 1:58:45.900]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keep info wars
[1:58:45.900 --> 1:58:47.460]  as strong as ever.
[1:58:47.460 --> 1:58:52.300]  The newest product from info wars life is now available exclusively at info wars store.com.
[1:58:52.300 --> 1:58:57.940]  It is concentrated known herbs and compounds that will supercharge your body's natural
[1:58:57.940 --> 1:59:02.980]  defenses, your immune system, while at the same time, funding the info war.
[1:59:02.980 --> 1:59:07.500]  Our immune systems have always been critical, but in this globalist era, with all the criminal
[1:59:07.500 --> 1:59:11.940]  activity they're involved in, it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us and

[1:59:51.100 --> 1:59:58.940]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:59:58.940 --> 2:00:06.500]  He recently described Putin's denazification of Ukraine as laughable, and the brainwashed
[2:00:06.500 --> 2:00:11.100]  flock of the mainstream media certainly must agree.
[2:00:11.100 --> 2:00:16.780]  They have been told that Nazis wave the American flag and vote Republican, and the brainwashed
[2:00:16.780 --> 2:00:20.300]  flock always believe what they are told.
[2:00:20.300 --> 2:00:25.700]  But those of us still cleaving to our sanity, remember that Nazis were members of Hitler's
[2:00:25.700 --> 2:00:30.380]  National Socialist Party from the 1930s and 40s.
[2:00:30.380 --> 2:00:34.700]  And not only were there thousands of Nazis in western Ukraine back then, it is still
[2:00:34.700 --> 2:00:37.820]  a big part of their national pride.
[2:00:37.820 --> 2:00:44.900]  Nazi war criminal Stepan Bandera is a national hero, and there are actual Nazi organizations
[2:00:44.900 --> 2:00:47.940]  still thriving in Ukraine.
[2:00:47.940 --> 2:00:53.540]  Taking the as-of regimen, which is now a part of Ukraine's armed forces.
[2:00:53.540 --> 2:01:00.580]  The Nazification of Ukraine is well documented and easily verified, as is the Nazification
[2:01:00.580 --> 2:01:03.100]  of America.
[2:01:03.100 --> 2:01:08.660]  During the 1930s, there were many notable Americans who supported the Nazis, such as
[2:01:08.660 --> 2:01:16.860]  Prescott Bush, Henry Ford, and Fred Koch, banks such as JP Morgan and Chase Manhattan,
[2:01:16.860 --> 2:01:23.340]  companies such as General Motors, Standard Oil, Shell, and IBM.
[2:01:23.340 --> 2:01:29.420]  Major General Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marines was asked by these powerful entities to help
[2:01:29.420 --> 2:01:32.740]  them install national socialism in the United States.
[2:01:32.740 --> 2:01:38.060]  It appeared before the Congressional Committee the highest representation of the American
[2:01:38.060 --> 2:01:43.500]  people under subpoena to tell what I knew of activities, which I believe might lead
[2:01:43.500 --> 2:01:46.260]  to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[2:01:46.260 --> 2:01:51.740]  I was supposed to lead an organization of 500,000 men, which would be able to take over
[2:01:51.740 --> 2:01:53.540]  the functions of government.
[2:01:53.540 --> 2:01:58.540]  And when that plan failed, war broke out in Europe with the support of the banks and these
[2:01:58.540 --> 2:02:01.340]  American corporate entities.
[2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:06.540]  After World War II, only about a dozen were brought to justice at the Nuremberg Trials.
[2:02:06.540 --> 2:02:11.740]  The Catholic Church and the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis evade capture via the
[2:02:11.740 --> 2:02:17.380]  rat lines, which brought them mostly to South America, where they built an entire town in
[2:02:17.380 --> 2:02:19.140]  Argentina.
[2:02:19.140 --> 2:02:24.380]  In Operation Paperclip, the United States secretly absorbed thousands of Nazis into
[2:02:24.380 --> 2:02:30.500]  the U.S. government, where they led the NASA space program and helped pioneer the military
[2:02:30.500 --> 2:02:34.940]  industrial complex as well as big pharma.
[2:02:34.940 --> 2:02:40.300]  Many believe that being a Nazi is synonymous with being anti-Jewish, which may have been
[2:02:40.300 --> 2:02:44.300]  true in 1930s Germany, but it's complicated.
[2:02:44.300 --> 2:02:50.420]  Many high-ranking Nazis themselves, including Adolf Hitler, were Ashkenazi Jews, who can
[2:02:50.420 --> 2:02:56.540]  be traced back to the notorious Khazars, who mysteriously mass converted to Judaism about
[2:02:56.540 --> 2:03:01.180]  1300 years ago in the region now known as Ukraine.
[2:03:01.180 --> 2:03:06.780]  Ashkenazi Jews ran the political Zionist movement in Germany, and for several years,
[2:03:06.780 --> 2:03:12.980]  the Zionists were the only political party allowed to operate inside Germany by the Nazis.
[2:03:12.980 --> 2:03:19.580]  Both the Zionists and the Nazis wanted their own ethnically pure state, and for years before
[2:03:19.580 --> 2:03:25.540]  their final solution, the Nazis helped the Zionists in their efforts to establish the
[2:03:25.540 --> 2:03:28.820]  state of Israel within Palestine.
[2:03:28.820 --> 2:03:33.660]  It was far more complicated than mere racial hatred.
[2:03:33.660 --> 2:03:40.420]  Fascism can best be described as fascism, and fascism is godlessness.
[2:03:40.420 --> 2:03:47.500]  The word Nazi is a made-up slur, but the word fascist can be clearly defined.
[2:03:47.500 --> 2:03:53.500]  It stems from the Latin word foskis, which is a bundle of sticks banded together to form
[2:03:53.500 --> 2:04:02.540]  a deadly weapon, an old-school meme that represents the deadly power of an organized mob, a gang.
[2:04:02.540 --> 2:04:07.900]  When men lack a personal relationship with God, they inevitably band together out of
[2:04:07.900 --> 2:04:08.900]  fear.
[2:04:08.900 --> 2:04:14.620]  Submitting to the strongman for a small taste of dominance, they become just another beast
[2:04:14.620 --> 2:04:16.020]  in the jungle.
[2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:21.940]  And today, we can clearly see this fascist mentality in all of these godless groups.
[2:04:21.940 --> 2:04:28.540]  The woke, the Satanists, the transhumanists, and the genocidal mass murderers of the Great
[2:04:28.540 --> 2:04:34.340]  Reset are all merging together into one giant foskis.
[2:04:34.340 --> 2:04:41.820]  Godless men and women banded together out of fear, fascists serving the strongman.
[2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:48.180]  Spiritually speaking, these are the weakest among us, and so far, we are allowing them
[2:04:48.180 --> 2:04:51.420]  to destroy everything.
[2:04:51.420 --> 2:04:58.420]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[2:05:21.420 --> 2:05:28.780]  InfoWars, its paradoxical is more popular than ever, it is reaching more people than
[2:05:28.780 --> 2:05:33.380]  ever despite the censorship, but because of cost-increasing and having to run our own
[2:05:33.380 --> 2:05:37.740]  infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of
[2:05:37.740 --> 2:05:38.740]  money.

[2:05:56.580 --> 2:06:24.580]  Thank you for your support.
[2:06:26.580 --> 2:06:38.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back here live in studio, Owen Schroyer, filling in for
[2:06:38.420 --> 2:06:44.740]  Alex Jones, and my next guest is Josh Leckich, am I pronouncing that right?
[2:06:44.740 --> 2:06:47.220]  It doesn't matter, LeCache, LeCache, it doesn't matter.
[2:06:47.220 --> 2:06:52.620]  LeCache, LeCache, the point is, he's with us in studio and he's a new victim of the
[2:06:52.620 --> 2:07:01.540]  authoritarian, totalitarian, Democrat party censorship, and I mean, there's no knowing
[2:07:01.540 --> 2:07:02.540]  for sure.
[2:07:02.540 --> 2:07:05.980]  He goes on infowars the other day, immediately after that they ban him.
[2:07:05.980 --> 2:07:07.900]  Is it directly because he went on infowars?
[2:07:07.900 --> 2:07:08.900]  We'll never know for sure.
[2:07:08.900 --> 2:07:14.660]  I'm sure it had something to do with it, but it's just the ongoing censorship, and so it's
[2:07:14.660 --> 2:07:15.900]  the same old story.
[2:07:15.900 --> 2:07:20.540]  They tell you you're guilty of hate speech, but they don't actually tell you what hate
[2:07:20.540 --> 2:07:21.940]  speech you're guilty of.
[2:07:21.940 --> 2:07:25.620]  So just talk about what it's been like because, and you don't have to get too much into personal
[2:07:25.620 --> 2:07:32.940]  information, but you fund yourself with Patreon, you're an independent show host of wrong opinion,
[2:07:32.940 --> 2:07:36.940]  you've got a newborn baby that you just had, you're just supporting that and your wife,
[2:07:36.940 --> 2:07:39.580]  and then boom, they pull the rug out from under you.
[2:07:39.580 --> 2:07:45.980]  Yeah, they get you in the best time possible to make you basically a slave to the system.
[2:07:45.980 --> 2:07:50.660]  They want you completely demoralized, they want you to bend the knee, and they want you
[2:07:50.660 --> 2:07:54.060]  to stop what you're doing and stop what you're talking about.
[2:07:54.060 --> 2:07:58.840]  But this invigorated me, I mean I'm stronger than ever, although I have to rebuild something
[2:07:58.840 --> 2:08:02.140]  from nothing, I can rebuild something from nothing.
[2:08:02.140 --> 2:08:04.340]  These people don't know how to build anything.
[2:08:04.340 --> 2:08:10.180]  All they know how to do is have that HR mindset that is about tearing down anything of value.
[2:08:10.180 --> 2:08:13.220]  They don't know what value looks like.
[2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:17.260]  You just said it right there, they're talking about their whole build back better thing,
[2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:19.260]  they can't build crap, they can't build squat.
[2:08:19.260 --> 2:08:24.740]  They just want to destroy and then build their kingdom off of our ashes, off of our rubble.
[2:08:24.740 --> 2:08:26.700]  We're actually doing things to build back better.
[2:08:26.700 --> 2:08:30.740]  We had to build back better here, we had to build band.video.
[2:08:30.740 --> 2:08:34.540]  You're having to build back better, whenever you come out on the other side of this, you're
[2:08:34.540 --> 2:08:38.000]  going to be better, so it's really us that are building back better, maybe we should
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:39.780]  be the ones running the government.
[2:08:39.780 --> 2:08:45.620]  Yeah, yeah, I mean we're the best at building something from nothing.
[2:08:45.620 --> 2:08:51.740]  The whole point of their agenda is to create surfdom, a new class of people that we thought
[2:08:51.740 --> 2:08:57.780]  was stuck in the past and we had something completely new and better.
[2:08:57.780 --> 2:09:01.260]  It's like, hey, it's the Industrial Revolution, now the middle class and everybody can have
[2:09:01.260 --> 2:09:02.740]  prosperity and upward mobility.
[2:09:02.740 --> 2:09:04.660]  Yeah, they don't want that though.
[2:09:04.660 --> 2:09:07.900]  So they're all fine, they're all fine on the top.
[2:09:07.900 --> 2:09:12.220]  But it might be Pennywise Dollar Stupid because it might come back and hurt them later on
[2:09:12.220 --> 2:09:13.460]  in the future.
[2:09:13.460 --> 2:09:17.380]  The thing is, is that this is just making us stronger, the people who don't quit are
[2:09:17.380 --> 2:09:19.700]  stronger than anyone.
[2:09:19.700 --> 2:09:20.700]  Anyone of these people.
[2:09:20.700 --> 2:09:22.300]  Well, here's what I realized.
[2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:27.340]  I have friends and family and I'm sure you're a popular guy, I'm a pretty popular guy and
[2:09:27.340 --> 2:09:31.140]  I have friends and family that really don't care about my politics or even don't like
[2:09:31.140 --> 2:09:37.220]  my politics, but when they hear or they learn about the political persecution I'm under,
[2:09:37.220 --> 2:09:39.980]  the censorship that I face, they're stunned.
[2:09:39.980 --> 2:09:43.820]  They can't believe that this is going on in America and you just become an example of
[2:09:43.820 --> 2:09:49.300]  reality and they kind of look at themselves and they say, huh, maybe I am not fully aware
[2:09:49.300 --> 2:09:52.980]  of what's going on in my country right now, maybe I'm not fully aware of the corruption
[2:09:52.980 --> 2:09:53.980]  in my country right now.
[2:09:53.980 --> 2:09:57.700]  I may not agree with Owen's politics, but this isn't right, what's being done to him.
[2:09:57.700 --> 2:10:00.180]  I would imagine a similar thing has happened to you now.
[2:10:00.180 --> 2:10:06.420]  Yeah, everyone is asleep at the wheel and they're very comfortable.
[2:10:06.420 --> 2:10:12.620]  The notion, the world economic forum notion of you'll own nothing and be happy is correct.
[2:10:12.620 --> 2:10:16.340]  It's a very evil statement, but for me it seems to be correct.
[2:10:16.340 --> 2:10:22.340]  It seems like people in the United States are going along as business as usual and it's
[2:10:22.340 --> 2:10:27.020]  because they've been trained really well to ignore reality, but that's basically the
[2:10:27.020 --> 2:10:30.260]  whole leftist dogma, it's to ignore reality.
[2:10:30.260 --> 2:10:35.100]  That's why you have the whole trans swimmer thing and people are accepting it and introducing
[2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:38.620]  sex to children in school and people thinking it's okay.
[2:10:38.620 --> 2:10:43.780]  It's because they've inverted reality and people accept it as the truth.
[2:10:43.780 --> 2:10:49.100]  The thing is that our side, we are objectively right and that's not a dogmatic thing to say.
[2:10:49.100 --> 2:10:53.820]  We are tied to nature, these people reject nature, they reject reality and we must keep
[2:10:53.820 --> 2:10:54.820]  fighting them.
[2:10:54.820 --> 2:10:58.300]  And that's why they hate God, that's why they hate the creator of this universe, whether
[2:10:58.300 --> 2:11:01.700]  you're religious or not folks, that's really what derives all of this.
[2:11:01.700 --> 2:11:06.500]  They want to kill God so that they can claim they're the creator and in charge of this
[2:11:06.500 --> 2:11:08.300]  planet they're not.
[2:11:08.300 --> 2:11:09.300]  And that's how they act.
[2:11:09.300 --> 2:11:12.860]  I mean, look at Big Tech, look at Google, they think they are omnipresent, they think
[2:11:12.860 --> 2:11:13.860]  they are God.
[2:11:13.860 --> 2:11:17.220]  That's why they're building this metaverse that I never want to go into.
[2:11:17.220 --> 2:11:19.300]  I don't think that's going to succeed, I think it's ready for you.
[2:11:19.300 --> 2:11:21.220]  You agree with Elon Musk?
[2:11:21.220 --> 2:11:22.220]  What did he say about this?
[2:11:22.220 --> 2:11:25.380]  He said that he doesn't think the world wants the metaverse, that we're going to reject
[2:11:25.380 --> 2:11:26.380]  it.
[2:11:26.380 --> 2:11:27.380]  Yeah, I think he's correct.
[2:11:27.380 --> 2:11:29.220]  I still don't really trust him fully.
[2:11:29.220 --> 2:11:30.220]  Yeah.
[2:11:30.220 --> 2:11:31.220]  Well, I'm just saying with this opinion though.
[2:11:31.220 --> 2:11:33.260]  Yeah, with that, I think he's absolutely right.
[2:11:33.260 --> 2:11:36.900]  I'm never going to strap a frickin' whatever to my head.
[2:11:36.900 --> 2:11:38.100]  No, but you know what?
[2:11:38.100 --> 2:11:41.460]  They are strapping those two kids and they are strapping masks to their faces so it's
[2:11:41.460 --> 2:11:42.460]  basically training.
[2:11:42.460 --> 2:11:43.460]  That's what they're doing.
[2:11:43.460 --> 2:11:46.860]  They're training people to strap these foreign objects on their face that blind them of
[2:11:46.860 --> 2:11:47.860]  reality.
[2:11:47.860 --> 2:11:52.860]  It's the face sucker from alien analogy where you just become something else entirely.
[2:11:52.860 --> 2:11:58.860]  By the way, I remember growing up as a kid and just so people can kind of have an age
[2:11:58.860 --> 2:11:59.860]  reference.
[2:11:59.860 --> 2:12:00.860]  I'm not sure how old you are Josh.
[2:12:00.860 --> 2:12:01.860]  I'm 32.
[2:12:01.860 --> 2:12:02.860]  Oh yeah.
[2:12:02.860 --> 2:12:05.700]  I remember growing up as a kid and we still had, you know, we had the box TVs, right?
[2:12:05.700 --> 2:12:06.700]  Right.
[2:12:06.700 --> 2:12:11.180]  Most average U.S. homes pride about 28, 32 inch box screen TV, whatever, when I was a
[2:12:11.180 --> 2:12:17.340]  kid and it was well known and your parents knew this, you don't sit in front of the TV.
[2:12:17.340 --> 2:12:18.340]  It's bad for your eyes.
[2:12:18.340 --> 2:12:19.740]  It's bad for your brain.
[2:12:19.740 --> 2:12:24.420]  Now we take this TV and we just glue it right to the front of your forehead.
[2:12:24.420 --> 2:12:26.460]  It's like, what the hell happened?
[2:12:26.460 --> 2:12:27.460]  Yeah.
[2:12:27.460 --> 2:12:31.900]  I'm plugged into my phone all day long because, you know, for my show what we do, you know,
[2:12:31.900 --> 2:12:36.940]  I kind of have to be and I realized that when I try to look out into the horizon, I'm like,
[2:12:36.940 --> 2:12:40.140]  my vision is getting worse and I just had eye surgery a couple of years ago.
[2:12:40.140 --> 2:12:42.660]  My vision is getting worse and yeah, you're absolutely right.
[2:12:42.660 --> 2:12:49.500]  They're training people to put these things on their faces, on their eyes and I'm very
[2:12:49.500 --> 2:12:54.420]  curious to see what humans will look like in a hundred years from now with this sort
[2:12:54.420 --> 2:12:56.820]  of getting closer to the Wally situation.
[2:12:56.820 --> 2:13:02.180]  It really is going to be that and I mean, with the change in diet, the fake meats and
[2:13:02.180 --> 2:13:03.620]  the screens to your face.
[2:13:03.620 --> 2:13:08.620]  But here's kind of what I see happening if this is left untouched, it can play out organically.
[2:13:08.620 --> 2:13:12.980]  What you're going to see is, and it's mostly going to be, it will be on political lines.
[2:13:12.980 --> 2:13:13.980]  It's just the truth.
[2:13:13.980 --> 2:13:17.900]  The political left in America falls for all the BS and what I think you're going to see
[2:13:17.900 --> 2:13:23.100]  is the political left in America are all going to be either fat and unhappy or extremely
[2:13:23.100 --> 2:13:25.500]  malnourished and unhappy.
[2:13:25.500 --> 2:13:29.700]  Either way, it's going to be ugly looking, malnourished, fat, disgusting people that
[2:13:29.700 --> 2:13:34.340]  you can just see are unhealthy and then you're going to have, you know, say right wingers
[2:13:34.340 --> 2:13:37.020]  or conservatives or whatever and we're going to be the healthy looking ones.
[2:13:37.020 --> 2:13:39.940]  We're going to have eyes that can still, you still see a light in them.
[2:13:39.940 --> 2:13:41.220]  There's going to be a glow in the skin.
[2:13:41.220 --> 2:13:42.220]  You're going to be in good shape.
[2:13:42.220 --> 2:13:46.260]  I mean, I think you're really 10 to 20 years removed from, you can just tell what someone's
[2:13:46.260 --> 2:13:48.580]  politics are just by looking at them.
[2:13:48.580 --> 2:13:51.100]  You're really almost there.
[2:13:51.100 --> 2:13:52.100]  We're there right now.
[2:13:52.100 --> 2:13:58.180]  Look, the trick is you guys make as many babies as possible, make them as strong as possible.
[2:13:58.180 --> 2:14:00.060]  And yes, the future is going to be very hard.
[2:14:00.060 --> 2:14:03.580]  It's going to be very hard to navigate, but that's going to make them that much more savvy
[2:14:03.580 --> 2:14:07.940]  and you're going to be able to have, you're going to be able to be happy about your offspring
[2:14:07.940 --> 2:14:11.420]  and a world of unhappy, fat, ugly people.
[2:14:11.420 --> 2:14:13.580]  And look, yes, we are being replaced.
[2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:15.420]  Our borders are open, wide open.
[2:14:15.420 --> 2:14:19.420]  We all know that, but we still have to wake up every day and we still have to fight.
[2:14:19.420 --> 2:14:23.380]  See, there's certain laws of nature that the left is trying to override.
[2:14:23.380 --> 2:14:26.140]  They're not going to be able to, for example.
[2:14:26.140 --> 2:14:27.140]  And hey, you know what?
[2:14:27.140 --> 2:14:28.140]  Life is not fair.
[2:14:28.140 --> 2:14:29.140]  Okay.
[2:14:29.140 --> 2:14:33.260]  Life is not fair, but there's certain things that have always been present in human culture
[2:14:33.260 --> 2:14:36.260]  and that will remain in human civilization as long as we're still human.
[2:14:36.260 --> 2:14:42.100]  And that's that there's certain traits that are going to be, it's like they write stories
[2:14:42.100 --> 2:14:45.500]  about how attractive people have a better success and make more money.
[2:14:45.500 --> 2:14:46.940]  That's not going to change.
[2:14:46.940 --> 2:14:50.380]  People that are in shape, people that are attractive, and you can get more attractive.
[2:14:50.380 --> 2:14:55.380]  You just got to be healthy, eat the right things, exercise, taller men usually end up
[2:14:55.380 --> 2:14:57.020]  in positions of power.
[2:14:57.020 --> 2:15:01.420]  You know, women with certain physical characteristics and traits usually end up in better situations.
[2:15:01.420 --> 2:15:04.540]  I mean, these are just the laws of nature, it doesn't mean it's good or bad.
[2:15:04.540 --> 2:15:05.860]  That's just the fact of life.
[2:15:05.860 --> 2:15:09.740]  But these people want to override all of it with their butchered faces and their butchered
[2:15:09.740 --> 2:15:14.260]  hair and their butchered bodies to try to override the laws of nature.
[2:15:14.260 --> 2:15:18.540]  So yeah, you have kids that are healthy, that are in shape, that are smart, they're going
[2:15:18.540 --> 2:15:22.620]  to have the next, they're going to win in the next world that we're in unless humanity
[2:15:22.620 --> 2:15:23.620]  is just erased.
[2:15:23.620 --> 2:15:24.620]  Yeah.
[2:15:24.620 --> 2:15:27.220]  Rejecting nature is rejecting God and you can't fight God.
[2:15:27.220 --> 2:15:29.740]  It's impossible to try to fight God and win.
[2:15:29.740 --> 2:15:30.940]  And that's what they're doing every day.
[2:15:30.940 --> 2:15:31.940]  They're doing that.
[2:15:31.940 --> 2:15:32.940]  And we see it.
[2:15:32.940 --> 2:15:33.940]  And the mask is off.
[2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:36.500]  We see that this is exactly what they're doing and they're training people.
[2:15:36.500 --> 2:15:38.700]  They're training billions of people tacked that way.
[2:15:38.700 --> 2:15:39.700]  It's going to backfire.
[2:15:39.700 --> 2:15:40.700]  It's not going to work.
[2:15:40.700 --> 2:15:45.980]  What we have to do is be as strong as possible, be as happy as possible and be as fit as possible.
[2:15:45.980 --> 2:15:49.140]  Josh Leckich is with us in studio.
[2:15:49.140 --> 2:15:53.260]  Wrongopinion.net is where you can go to follow him now that he's joined the crowd of the
[2:15:53.260 --> 2:16:22.260]  band individuals, we'll be right back.
[2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:48.260]  We'll be right back.
[2:16:48.260 --> 2:16:49.260]  They really are.
[2:16:49.260 --> 2:16:50.260]  Sick.
[2:16:50.260 --> 2:16:51.260]  Evil.
[2:16:51.260 --> 2:16:52.260]  Bleak.
[2:16:52.260 --> 2:17:02.220]  So when I first started taking survival skill basically I was 275 pounds on Zobo weight.
[2:17:02.220 --> 2:17:04.520]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:17:04.520 --> 2:17:09.260]  I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. group on your show and I listened to it,
[2:17:09.260 --> 2:17:12.500]  so the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1.
[2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:13.500]  And it worked out good.
[2:17:13.500 --> 2:17:15.100]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with X2.
[2:17:15.100 --> 2:17:18.580]  You had, you know with the deep burdens, tors, you know, and I got really excited about
[2:17:18.580 --> 2:17:21.060]  that so I took it and man in two weeks, I went for it.
[2:17:21.060 --> 2:17:26.460]  went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened. You know, I could
[2:17:26.460 --> 2:17:31.300]  think again. I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next couple of
[2:17:31.300 --> 2:17:35.700]  years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're
[2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:40.420]  all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout literally like
[2:17:40.420 --> 2:17:44.460]  if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the point is we
[2:17:44.460 --> 2:17:48.580]  have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system. And the only
[2:17:48.580 --> 2:17:53.140]  way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands. Beautifully said, brother. I
[2:17:53.140 --> 2:18:00.380]  thank you so much for your call at Godspeed. The globalist social engineers always intended
[2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:08.260]  to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled. They would
[2:18:08.260 --> 2:18:14.340]  then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody
[2:18:14.340 --> 2:18:19.900]  that speaks out against their lives. But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers
[2:18:19.900 --> 2:18:26.140]  and others coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because
[2:18:26.140 --> 2:18:33.180]  the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back
[2:18:33.180 --> 2:18:37.580]  the curtain now more than ever. The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not
[2:18:37.580 --> 2:18:43.460]  going to give up on their takeover. Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency and
[2:18:43.460 --> 2:18:48.740]  martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[2:18:48.740 --> 2:18:53.180]  So pray for these folks big time. This is a very serious situation. And stay tuned into
[2:18:53.180 --> 2:18:57.260]  infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[2:18:57.260 --> 2:19:02.780]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though

[2:19:08.180 --> 2:19:13.140]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and
[2:19:13.140 --> 2:19:19.060]  what you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.

[2:19:58.580 --> 2:20:13.940]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:13.940 --> 2:20:18.140]  Back in studio here with Josh Leckich and I'm butchering the name, but he said it's
[2:20:18.140 --> 2:20:23.180]  okay. It's okay. It doesn't matter. Forgive and forget. We're just discussing this age
[2:20:23.180 --> 2:20:27.020]  of censorship, but I want to get back to something we were discussing in the last subject you
[2:20:27.020 --> 2:20:35.060]  brought up. Own nothing and be happy. To me, that's a hyperbolic statement and maybe I'm
[2:20:35.060 --> 2:20:40.500]  just speaking for myself, but I don't believe that's the case. I'll never forget and hey,
[2:20:40.500 --> 2:20:43.660]  you know what? People can say this is a bad thing about our culture or a good thing about
[2:20:43.660 --> 2:20:49.700]  our culture. That's fine to have the debate, but I'll never forget an old roommate of mine
[2:20:49.700 --> 2:20:54.860]  that I was living with and I was dating this girl from Brazil at the time. They have a
[2:20:54.860 --> 2:20:59.780]  much different culture there, especially when it comes to working, working hours and how
[2:20:59.780 --> 2:21:03.580]  much you put into your career. That's okay. Different cultures, different ways of life.
[2:21:03.580 --> 2:21:08.540]  That's great. Move around the planet. She asked one time, my friend, because me and my roommate
[2:21:08.540 --> 2:21:15.420]  were the same way, constantly on the go, constantly working 15 hours a day, rarely any time sitting
[2:21:15.420 --> 2:21:21.980]  around. One day, she asked my friend, she was shrugging because it was the same thing
[2:21:21.980 --> 2:21:25.900]  and she was like, why? She was like, why do you work so much? Why are you always working
[2:21:25.900 --> 2:21:32.620]  and running around? He kind of laughed and goes, because this is America, baby. It was
[2:21:32.620 --> 2:21:38.080]  such a perfect encapsulation because I will not be happy if I own nothing. It's not about
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:43.660]  owning things and possessing things like that's my identity. It's about I want to feel accomplished.
[2:21:43.660 --> 2:21:51.360]  I get endorphins. I get high out of accomplishing things. It's not that my possessions are my
[2:21:51.360 --> 2:21:55.700]  personality. It's like, I like that. That's part of our culture. That's rugged individualism.
[2:21:55.700 --> 2:21:59.940]  That's building prosperity in nations. I'm not going to be happy if I don't own anything.
[2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:03.420]  I'm not going to be happy if I'm sitting around in a pot eating bugs all day. That sounds
[2:22:03.420 --> 2:22:08.060]  like misery to me. They're training people though and it is working because I know that
[2:22:08.060 --> 2:22:12.700]  these people exist. I lived in Los Angeles for 11 years and I mean, that's why I met
[2:22:12.700 --> 2:22:17.660]  my wife. Oh, Lord. But she's amazing. So, you know, 11 years, you did it. I did it. It's
[2:22:17.660 --> 2:22:24.260]  like prison time maybe. But the thing is, it got noticeably worse every year. As every
[2:22:24.260 --> 2:22:30.620]  year passed, it got noticeably worse and the people became more zombified. We are a society
[2:22:30.620 --> 2:22:35.380]  right now of consumers. We don't create things. I mean, very few people right now are encouraged
[2:22:35.380 --> 2:22:39.540]  to create things. It's what are you consuming? I have a friend on, I mean, he's not a friend
[2:22:39.540 --> 2:22:44.060]  anymore, but I'm obsessed with watching his Instagram stories because it's just consume,
[2:22:44.060 --> 2:22:49.940]  consume, consume. He will watch the thing he's supposed to watch whatever date is and he
[2:22:49.940 --> 2:22:55.340]  will tag famous people. Like congratulations, Sean Penn. Sean Penn doesn't know you. Why
[2:22:55.340 --> 2:22:59.900]  are you congratulating Sean Penn? Or care. Yeah, or care, but that's the thing. That's
[2:22:59.900 --> 2:23:05.300]  where people derive their personality from. They don't cultivate anything they consume.
[2:23:05.300 --> 2:23:08.700]  That's like that study that just came out that said people that are obsessed with Hollywood
[2:23:08.700 --> 2:23:15.780]  celebrity culture have lower IQs. I remember Will Smith a few years ago saying that I forget
[2:23:15.780 --> 2:23:20.020]  who asked him this, but he basically said, why does anybody care what somebody they've
[2:23:20.020 --> 2:23:23.860]  never met, never will meet and will never know your name? Why do you care what they
[2:23:23.860 --> 2:23:27.580]  think about you? And that was basically him saying, why do you care about my life? Why
[2:23:27.580 --> 2:23:32.540]  are you so obsessed with Will Smith? I don't care about you. Well, I mean, that's the thing.
[2:23:32.540 --> 2:23:38.980]  This is the, that's just what it's become. It used to be kind of segregated, you know,
[2:23:38.980 --> 2:23:43.980]  to certain small enclaves within society, but it's literally everyone has adopted then.
[2:23:43.980 --> 2:23:48.060]  I think it's because of the advent of social media. Everyone sees themselves as the main
[2:23:48.060 --> 2:23:52.500]  movie, the main character of their movie. Everyone thinks that this is a movie. This
[2:23:52.500 --> 2:23:57.100]  is all, but it's, this is reality and you're just not experiencing it. And you're living
[2:23:57.100 --> 2:24:02.740]  your life vicariously through this synthetic world that doesn't even actually exist. They
[2:24:02.740 --> 2:24:06.380]  want you to dive headlong into it, or you're living your life vicariously through your
[2:24:06.380 --> 2:24:10.420]  favorite celebrity and you've bought into this notion that you're never going to make
[2:24:10.420 --> 2:24:14.140]  it. You're never going to accomplish anything. So I might as well just follow the celebrity.
[2:24:14.140 --> 2:24:20.100]  That makes me feel good when, when ultimately that's the, that's the biggest downer. That's
[2:24:20.100 --> 2:24:25.540]  the biggest depression factor that you could probably voluntarily induce yourself into.
[2:24:25.540 --> 2:24:30.940]  Something that is real. They, they try to discourage you from adopting that into your
[2:24:30.940 --> 2:24:36.340]  life. I mean, just look at any piece of media for the last 20 years or 30 years that the
[2:24:36.340 --> 2:24:40.620]  father is a complete idiot. Having kids is going to destroy your life. You're never going
[2:24:40.620 --> 2:24:45.380]  to have a social life anymore. And I think of my social life in my twenties as just a
[2:24:45.380 --> 2:24:49.540]  waste of time. You know, you're just hanging out the worst of the worst types of people.
[2:24:49.540 --> 2:24:53.460]  Yeah. You get over going to the bar scene or whatever, you know, so your social life
[2:24:53.460 --> 2:24:58.260]  is your family. Exactly. And you're like, you're, you're hanging out with the world's
[2:24:58.260 --> 2:25:03.140]  best people and for yourself, you know, but they don't want that. They don't want that
[2:25:03.140 --> 2:25:07.980]  for you. They want you alone and isolated. Look, I mean, like banning me from Patreon,
[2:25:07.980 --> 2:25:10.660]  that's what they want you to feel one way or another. They're going to want you to feel
[2:25:10.660 --> 2:25:14.380]  alone and isolated. They're, they're going to want you to feel like the minority in your,
[2:25:14.380 --> 2:25:18.820]  in your own country when, you know, even though the borders are still open, we are the majority.
[2:25:18.820 --> 2:25:23.180]  We have to stop being the silent majority. We need to be the loud majority, but we are
[2:25:23.180 --> 2:25:27.580]  the majority. And, and you know, that's honestly the biggest problem with the American right
[2:25:27.580 --> 2:25:28.580]  or conservatives.
[2:25:28.580 --> 2:25:32.900]  And I don't even know what the solution is. You can't herd cats as they say, but the,
[2:25:32.900 --> 2:25:37.160]  the right has never really been unified on anything. I mean, we just, we don't unify.
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:41.860]  We don't have big press conferences together. We don't do big narrative push. No, we must
[2:25:41.860 --> 2:25:46.380]  reject Nick Fuentes, they say. Yeah. Okay. And then, and so half the people do half the
[2:25:46.380 --> 2:25:50.980]  people don't. And then that becomes a polarizing thing. Because he said something bad online.
[2:25:50.980 --> 2:25:55.820]  I say bad things online every day. Like who cares? What happened? Like, I mean, Howard
[2:25:55.820 --> 2:26:02.340]  Stern became famous because he was such a rude a-hole. He pretends like his, his, his
[2:26:02.340 --> 2:26:06.260]  origins never happened. He pretends like the first 30 years of his, yeah, he never did
[2:26:06.260 --> 2:26:09.860]  the movie private parts about how he came up in media. That was not an art. That was
[2:26:09.860 --> 2:26:13.180]  in the multi, that was in a different universe, alternate universe, not in ours. He didn't
[2:26:13.180 --> 2:26:17.060]  do that. He's always been virtuous. And, and you know, here's, here's what I think it is
[2:26:17.060 --> 2:26:22.980]  for, for most of the deranged liberal left. It's honestly just laziness. I mean, the Bible
[2:26:22.980 --> 2:26:27.940]  talks about how, you know, being, being lazy is a sin. And that's really what it is to
[2:26:27.940 --> 2:26:32.300]  me. It's, it's really just laziness. Yeah, you know what? Josh working and doing a show
[2:26:32.300 --> 2:26:36.260]  and doing his own thing and then raising a family. Yeah, that's tough. That, that's hard
[2:26:36.260 --> 2:26:42.700]  work. It's rewarding. And I think that that's why they're so obsessed with, oh, let's love
[2:26:42.700 --> 2:26:47.380]  fat people and let's not body shame and all of this stuff. No, maybe we should be body
[2:26:47.380 --> 2:26:52.700]  shaming out of love and support to say, Hey, you're going a really bad direction here with
[2:26:52.700 --> 2:26:58.500]  your health. Here's the story I was talking about. MSNBC. Why the far right is really
[2:26:58.500 --> 2:27:03.660]  into fitness. When was that? When was that published? Let me see if I can get the date
[2:27:03.660 --> 2:27:06.260]  on here. But they always put out articles like that.
[2:27:06.260 --> 2:27:09.940]  You guys pull up this story. I don't have a date on this. They also encourage people
[2:27:09.940 --> 2:27:18.260]  to masturbate and watch porn or become a prostitute. Yeah. Yeah. A horrible addiction. Yeah, no,
[2:27:18.260 --> 2:27:21.540]  but, but that's the thing. It's all tied to the same thing. They want you alone. They
[2:27:21.540 --> 2:27:25.860]  don't want you to have any meaningful interaction with anyone. I mean, that's what the lockdowns
[2:27:25.860 --> 2:27:30.580]  were. It was a social experiment to see if they, if people would comply and would separate
[2:27:30.580 --> 2:27:35.740]  entirely from people and people to this day are still complying with that. Here it is
[2:27:35.740 --> 2:27:42.500]  right here. This is, this is actually published yesterday morning. It's, they keep, they keep
[2:27:42.500 --> 2:27:46.020]  changing the headline there, by the way, when I printed it, the headline was why the far
[2:27:46.020 --> 2:27:49.660]  right is really into fitness. Now the main headline says pandemic fitness trends have
[2:27:49.660 --> 2:27:56.860]  gone extreme, literally sub headline, white supremacists, latest scheme to valorize violence
[2:27:56.860 --> 2:28:01.700]  and hyper masculinity has gone digital. So, oh, oh, if you want to be in good shape and
[2:28:01.700 --> 2:28:05.900]  you want to have, have muscle tone, you're a white supremacist and you're violent now.
[2:28:05.900 --> 2:28:10.220]  Yeah. I think I actually think violence is good if the good people do it. Conservatives.
[2:28:10.220 --> 2:28:16.340]  Yeah. I'm, I'm violently bench pressing 300 pounds. Yeah. I mean, look, conservatives
[2:28:16.340 --> 2:28:20.420]  have been too passive and too nice. They, they turn the other cheek. They think that
[2:28:20.420 --> 2:28:25.540]  if, if only they'll be left alone, uh, people will be nice. You know, they'll, they'll,
[2:28:25.540 --> 2:28:28.660]  if they separate themselves from culture and society, people will be nice to them.
[2:28:28.660 --> 2:28:34.060]  So just leave me alone. They want you dead. Look, taking away my income is them wanting
[2:28:34.060 --> 2:28:37.660]  to kill me and kill my family. And I'm not exaggerating because this is literally how
[2:28:37.660 --> 2:28:41.460]  I support my family. No, it's a death call. That's what they do. We got to take a break.
[2:28:41.460 --> 2:28:44.380]  Let's, let's, let's finish up this conversation on the other side because that's what it is.
[2:28:44.380 --> 2:28:48.420]  It's a death call. They don't want you to be healthy. They don't want you to be free.
[2:28:48.420 --> 2:28:51.980]  They don't want you to have a healthy diet. They hate you and want you dead. It's this
[2:28:51.980 --> 2:28:56.540]  weird suicide pack the left wants you to sign on to. No, thanks. I'm good. I like life.
[2:28:56.540 --> 2:29:01.900]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it. It's just true that info wars
[2:29:01.900 --> 2:29:09.940]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[2:29:09.940 --> 2:29:17.540]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program. And man, our work is really right

[2:31:04.020 --> 2:31:12.140]  the mind control, the asleep France that the general public is in, the best word would
[2:31:12.140 --> 2:31:19.180]  actually be the people are lost. Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare
[2:31:19.180 --> 2:31:26.420]  or you're in a horror you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you
[2:31:26.420 --> 2:31:30.740]  are totally dizzy and confused. You have a concussion and that's what the globalists
[2:31:30.740 --> 2:31:35.460]  have done. They have stunned us. They have put us into a position of not knowing our
[2:31:35.460 --> 2:31:39.260]  bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave him a speech he called the great
[2:31:39.260 --> 2:31:44.780]  new narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture in the media has
[2:31:44.780 --> 2:31:48.980]  been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over
[2:31:48.980 --> 2:31:53.700]  the edge of a cliff. That's what the great reason is. They need darkness to thrive. The
[2:31:53.700 --> 2:32:02.700]  light lives at infowars.com. There is very little contemporary study in the world of
[2:32:02.700 --> 2:32:09.140]  the planet's ruling class. Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States,
[2:32:09.140 --> 2:32:14.580]  not anywhere. Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by
[2:32:14.580 --> 2:32:20.220]  design. The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target
[2:32:20.220 --> 2:32:26.100]  any academics that look in to say the Anglo-American establishment, the sound of the Bilderberg
[2:32:26.100 --> 2:32:29.900]  group, the trilateral commission, the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[2:32:29.900 --> 2:32:35.140]  and the Rockefellers. Until ten years ago the media said the controlled corporate media
[2:32:35.140 --> 2:32:39.460]  of the Bilderberg group didn't exist. Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its
[2:32:39.460 --> 2:32:44.860]  former head. Still on the steering committee is Klaus Schwab and he has set up the great
[2:32:44.860 --> 2:32:50.100]  reset in global government. And if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist
[2:32:50.100 --> 2:32:54.860]  head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't
[2:32:54.860 --> 2:32:59.260]  have a shot. If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[2:32:59.260 --> 2:33:06.260]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:29.260 --> 2:33:35.780]  He's dealing with the censorship now. Josh Leckich and you can follow him wrongopinion.net
[2:33:35.780 --> 2:33:39.620]  is the best place to go to follow his stuff because he's getting banned everywhere right
[2:33:39.620 --> 2:33:45.940]  now. It doesn't surprise me though when you talk about real issues and you talk the truth
[2:33:45.940 --> 2:33:50.140]  and you say women or women, that's the kind of thing that gets you banned these days folks
[2:33:50.140 --> 2:33:54.060]  is saying that women are women. You can't say that, that's controversial.
[2:33:54.060 --> 2:33:59.500]  I don't judge my gender just because I have a penis and an Adam's apple and a beard. Yeah,
[2:33:59.500 --> 2:34:04.420]  you can't do that. How dare you. I kind of like the Lea Thomas thing because he's not
[2:34:04.420 --> 2:34:08.820]  even trying to sound like a woman. You know what? I'm going to like it. I think it's funny.
[2:34:08.820 --> 2:34:11.900]  I'm going to make a prediction and I hope that because sometimes I don't like making
[2:34:11.900 --> 2:34:15.260]  predictions because I'm afraid it could alter history and I'd rather just see things play
[2:34:15.260 --> 2:34:22.220]  out. But I will make a prediction or I'll hope let's say that as soon as Lea Thomas
[2:34:22.220 --> 2:34:27.540]  is done swimming as a NCAA athlete goes back to being Will Thomas. Absolutely. He's going
[2:34:27.540 --> 2:34:31.300]  to get married and have kids and teach. Still has a penis. Oh, well, yeah. And he's still
[2:34:31.300 --> 2:34:35.820]  dating women. You know that, right? I mean, in that interview with SportsCenter, that was
[2:34:35.820 --> 2:34:39.660]  a dude. That was a dude from Santa Barbara. It's like, oh, Lea Thomas, the new NCAA female
[2:34:39.660 --> 2:34:44.380]  champion. Yeah, it's a real honor to be up here swimming against my fellow women. I
[2:34:44.380 --> 2:34:48.420]  think he's trolling and I think that it helps our cause. I'm not kidding. So all the conservatives
[2:34:48.420 --> 2:34:55.980]  are outraged. I'm like, no, he's helping us. I tend to agree. Like the obvious instinctual
[2:34:55.980 --> 2:35:02.220]  reaction is this is ridiculous. This is obscene. This should not be going on. But it does need
[2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:06.380]  to read. There has to be a point in this timeline. And I don't know if it is Lea Thomas doing
[2:35:06.380 --> 2:35:11.780]  this or not. But there has to be a point in this timeline where men are going to intentionally
[2:35:11.780 --> 2:35:17.340]  go into sports as women just to prove a point. They have to. It's inevitable. I don't know
[2:35:17.340 --> 2:35:22.180]  if that's Lea Thomas now, but it will be Lea Thomas in the future. No, I think that
[2:35:22.180 --> 2:35:27.780]  they have to do that because I think the only way we can really win is use their rules that
[2:35:27.780 --> 2:35:32.420]  they create and just, you know, to our advantage. I think we should do that. See, there's always
[2:35:32.420 --> 2:35:36.020]  people that are willing to put themselves out there. It's embarrassing. Show an example.
[2:35:36.020 --> 2:35:40.380]  Like it is embarrassing. And if that's what Lea Thomas is doing, then, you know, I think
[2:35:40.380 --> 2:35:43.260]  that's hilarious. You know what's funny is that conservatives draw the line with women
[2:35:43.260 --> 2:35:48.220]  swimming, but not Dave Rubin making two babies from. Yeah, that was that was an interesting
[2:35:48.220 --> 2:35:53.340]  thing to follow. I'm going to withhold comment on that one. Okay, yeah. I like Dave Rubin.
[2:35:53.340 --> 2:35:58.420]  He's a good guy. I like Dave Rubin, too. And whatever he does in the bedroom is none of
[2:35:58.420 --> 2:36:04.540]  my business. But it's, you know, it is funny to watch the the the mainline conservative
[2:36:04.540 --> 2:36:10.180]  movement. Oh, they ridicule Pete Butt judge because his him and his husband have kids.
[2:36:10.180 --> 2:36:14.460]  But then, you know, if they celebrate Dave Rubin and his his husband having kids. Yeah,
[2:36:14.460 --> 2:36:19.580]  but the men swimming as a as a female man swimming as a female. That's where we draw
[2:36:19.580 --> 2:36:25.100]  the line. I would even go as far to say that if because look, there's always people in
[2:36:25.100 --> 2:36:29.340]  human history that put themselves on the line to prove a point. I've got it before. I stood
[2:36:29.340 --> 2:36:33.180]  in the U. S. Capitol. This was long before January 6. I stood in the U. S. Capitol with
[2:36:33.180 --> 2:36:37.900]  a piece of tape over my mouth to show that only one side of the political aisle gets
[2:36:37.900 --> 2:36:42.540]  free speech in this country. And that's the left wing. So they had 45 people out there,
[2:36:42.540 --> 2:36:47.940]  whatever, protesting for Trump's impeachment in the Capitol. And they were allowed to do
[2:36:47.940 --> 2:36:52.460]  that. All day long, they were allowed to protest for Trump's impeachment. A whole group of
[2:36:52.460 --> 2:36:57.780]  people funded by the Democrat Party. I go back the next day in the exact same spot that they
[2:36:57.780 --> 2:37:01.540]  were in with a piece of tape over my mouth, and I get arrested. So I knew I was going
[2:37:01.540 --> 2:37:05.700]  to get arrested. That's me putting myself out there to prove a point. So if Leah Thomas
[2:37:05.700 --> 2:37:10.740]  or Will Thomas is doing all this to prove a point, I actually salute that. I'm sorry
[2:37:10.740 --> 2:37:15.620]  for the female victims of this, but this is what the left has done. Yeah, by the way,
[2:37:15.620 --> 2:37:20.420]  that clip of you, that was an insurrection. Probably me standing there with a piece of
[2:37:20.420 --> 2:37:24.580]  tape over my mouth. You were trying to overthrow the United States government. I mean, could
[2:37:24.580 --> 2:37:30.700]  you? How could you? Why am I here in three in three in three different legal cases now?
[2:37:30.700 --> 2:37:36.340]  The Democrats are trying to ban me from Washington, DC. Well, I'll represent you there. I'm going
[2:37:36.340 --> 2:37:42.660]  there tonight. So I'll represent you. Are you really? Yeah, I'm meeting Elijah. Yeah,
[2:37:42.660 --> 2:37:46.620]  you need to have like some sort of a seance or some sort of a protective. I just, I feel
[2:37:46.620 --> 2:37:49.900]  like I'm not going to be allowed to go. That's my gut feeling. I don't know, especially because
[2:37:49.900 --> 2:37:53.140]  I'm here right now. It really is probably the worst place in America, I would say is
[2:37:53.140 --> 2:37:58.700]  DC right now. Oh, it's going to have horrible energy. And I guarantee you that those people,
[2:37:58.700 --> 2:38:02.540]  very bad people watch you guys. I know this for a fact. I mean, when I was on the show
[2:38:02.540 --> 2:38:07.540]  yesterday, then they kept plugging my Patreon. It was no coincidence. I got back to the hotel
[2:38:07.540 --> 2:38:12.100]  after and I was completely wiped out. Oh, I know for a fact that there are individuals
[2:38:12.100 --> 2:38:17.340]  that get paid just to watch my show every day and write hit pieces on me like, for example,
[2:38:17.340 --> 2:38:20.900]  you could look at a Timothy Johnson from media matters like, look, oh, I don't know who you
[2:38:20.900 --> 2:38:25.700]  are Timothy with you and your little creepy pictures on the internet and, and Josh Holt
[2:38:25.700 --> 2:38:29.340]  or with Jared Holt or whatever. Like, yeah, they, they pay people just to watch our stuff
[2:38:29.340 --> 2:38:32.740]  to try to write hit pieces about us or now try to get us put in jail.
[2:38:32.740 --> 2:38:35.540]  You know, what's weird is that they watch you guys all day long and we haven't redpilled
[2:38:35.540 --> 2:38:39.540]  them yet. How is that possible if they watch? Are they really? Yeah, I mean, because there's
[2:38:39.540 --> 2:38:44.780]  one of my monitors right there. How about that? That guy looks sane. They have bug eyes. They're
[2:38:44.780 --> 2:38:49.460]  on too many SSRIs. They're, they're on, on heavy pharmaceutical. That's the thing is
[2:38:49.460 --> 2:38:55.540]  you can only withstand this kind of world, this kind of reality by being drugged up and
[2:38:55.540 --> 2:39:00.260]  also drugged up with the food. The food is just trash. It's like all these things. And,
[2:39:00.260 --> 2:39:03.940]  and that's how you can do it. That's how you'll be happy when you own nothing.
[2:39:03.940 --> 2:39:08.420]  That's what it's all about is, Oh, I got my pharmaceutical pill or I've got my pornography.
[2:39:08.420 --> 2:39:13.260]  So I feel good, even though I'm a total slave and people like Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[2:39:13.260 --> 2:39:18.380]  I mean, like if I was going to side with them, even to play devil's advocate, I would say,
[2:39:18.380 --> 2:39:23.180]  yeah, you know what? I understand why Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab want to wipe off most
[2:39:23.180 --> 2:39:28.100]  of the population because they've become pretty much worthless. Yeah, I'm not taking that
[2:39:28.100 --> 2:39:31.260]  stance. I'm saying if I'm playing devil's advocate and I'm having meetings with these
[2:39:31.260 --> 2:39:34.980]  billionaires and they're saying, look, Owen, because they have, you know, they, you know,
[2:39:34.980 --> 2:39:38.940]  they promote this to people. They probably brought it to Trump and they say, look, why
[2:39:38.940 --> 2:39:43.900]  would you want to support these people? They add nothing to civilization. They're suckers.
[2:39:43.900 --> 2:39:47.580]  They fall for anything. All they do is consume and give nothing to the planet. Why shouldn't
[2:39:47.580 --> 2:39:52.380]  we wipe them out? That's their logic. But they don't understand that they are the people
[2:39:52.380 --> 2:39:58.540]  that they hate. Like Bill Gates has man boobs. I mean, he, if he was jacked and he ate steaks
[2:39:58.540 --> 2:40:02.180]  and that's all he ate, but then he tried to, you know, he was, he'd be a hypocrite and
[2:40:02.180 --> 2:40:06.580]  he'd sell, you know, like eat bugs and eat fake meats and all that, then I'd get it.
[2:40:06.580 --> 2:40:12.660]  But he's a product of his own creation really. He's a soy boy. He is a massive soy boy.
[2:40:12.660 --> 2:40:18.060]  I mean, at least Bezos like, oh yeah, he plays the role of a badass, bad guy. He's trying
[2:40:18.060 --> 2:40:21.380]  to get jacked. Yeah. I mean, he's probably doing steroids or something. Yeah. And they
[2:40:21.380 --> 2:40:27.660]  all have blood boys and all that, you know, they really do the blood transfusions. I mean,
[2:40:27.660 --> 2:40:33.580]  how is Henry Kissinger still alive? Yeah, he's still alive, right? Yeah, I mean, sure.
[2:40:33.580 --> 2:40:38.660]  And you look at, like you look at the Hollywood people too. It's like, how do they look so
[2:40:38.660 --> 2:40:41.900]  young when they're in their 60s? Now, we know they all have surgeries and stuff, but you
[2:40:41.900 --> 2:40:44.420]  know, there's other stuff. There's other stuff. We don't need to get into
[2:40:44.420 --> 2:40:50.860]  the ambrosia, you know. But they're sick. These people are satanic. They are sick. All
[2:40:50.860 --> 2:40:56.060]  right, here's an example of it guys. Let's roll clip 12. So, you know, Judge Jackson
[2:40:56.060 --> 2:41:00.500]  says, I'm not a biologist. I can't tell you what a woman is really. Well, I mean, I'm
[2:41:00.500 --> 2:41:04.580]  not a professional basketball player, but I know what a hoop looks like. Or I guess
[2:41:04.580 --> 2:41:09.220]  I shouldn't say that. So, so what is a woman? The left seems to be confused. Here's more
[2:41:09.220 --> 2:41:13.980]  evidence of that in clip 12. Watch this. Eight of being a girl. And I've gotten some
[2:41:13.980 --> 2:41:19.100]  messages that are saying that I need to be calling myself a woman and not a girl. And
[2:41:19.100 --> 2:41:23.180]  I didn't even know that some women were offended by being called girls. So that's really good
[2:41:23.180 --> 2:41:30.900]  to know. But for me, the word girl feels great because I never got to be one growing up.
[2:41:30.900 --> 2:41:36.660]  And it feels very able to make mistakes and growing and changing and evolving. Whereas
[2:41:36.660 --> 2:41:42.100]  the word woman feels very strong and confident and powerful. And that still intimidates me
[2:41:42.100 --> 2:41:46.940]  a little bit. So I'm going to keep calling myself a girl. Hope that's okay. Love you.
[2:41:46.940 --> 2:41:52.100]  So that's a grown man promoting how he pretends to be a woman. Now, look, I don't care what
[2:41:52.100 --> 2:41:56.140]  that guy does in his private life. Just leave the kids out of it. Yeah, but this is always
[2:41:56.140 --> 2:41:59.700]  about indoctrinating kids. By the way, I didn't know Ben Shapiro became a trend. Oh,
[2:41:59.700 --> 2:42:06.940]  that kind of actually that is a little Ben Shapiro. Ben Shapiro. But would you trust
[2:42:06.940 --> 2:42:12.380]  this person? I would love to ask the average leftist. Would you trust this person watching
[2:42:12.380 --> 2:42:17.540]  over your kids? Well, you know that what they would say, they would love it. Well, but actually
[2:42:17.540 --> 2:42:21.900]  true because they keep offering their kids up as sacrificial lambs to, you know, they're
[2:42:21.900 --> 2:42:26.780]  like, yeah, they like hold their kid up like Simba and Lion King like mutilate my child's
[2:42:26.780 --> 2:42:32.100]  genitals, please. Yeah, so actually, that's not a good question. I you I stand corrected.
[2:42:32.100 --> 2:42:37.220]  But these people are absolutely insane. And, you know, I used to have that libertarian mindset
[2:42:37.220 --> 2:42:41.580]  of I don't care what these people do behind closed bedrooms, but behind behind closed doors.
[2:42:41.580 --> 2:42:46.420]  That's not what it is anymore. I mean, these people are after your kids and they are trying
[2:42:46.420 --> 2:42:51.620]  to normalize the abnormal. Hey, normal. He is why they're in the classroom now and bring
[2:42:51.620 --> 2:42:55.460]  in drag queen story time. Josh, thank you so much. Follow him wrong. Opinion.net. Thank
[2:42:55.460 --> 2:43:03.460]  you. Our world is so full of I your force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[2:43:03.460 --> 2:43:09.020]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities. Why is this the case? Because
[2:43:09.020 --> 2:43:14.140]  we innately by God have been given the keys to our own minds, our own psyches, our own
[2:43:14.140 --> 2:43:21.060]  souls. And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and trend, sin, the quote, fallen
[2:43:21.060 --> 2:43:26.160]  or sinful state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring
[2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:31.860]  into our bodies to to change the arm are only lowering us. They're only making us more
[2:43:31.860 --> 2:43:36.540]  depressed. In the end, they're only making us less filled. It is only by going within
[2:43:36.540 --> 2:43:40.980]  and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves. That's why
[2:43:40.980 --> 2:43:45.860]  the globalist bombard us with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and
[2:43:45.860 --> 2:43:51.340]  minerals and trace elements. Our bodies need healthy and to be able to basically reach
[2:43:51.340 --> 2:43:55.500]  out beyond the third dimension. And that's what the incredible products come in at
[2:43:55.500 --> 2:44:23.220]  core.com. That's basically the ethos of the globalist. They must first play God. They
[2:44:23.220 --> 2:44:30.140]  must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system. And in
[2:44:30.140 --> 2:44:35.380]  a way, they're right. If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us, destroy
[2:44:35.380 --> 2:44:40.700]  our children's futures, the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open, we really deserve what's
[2:44:40.700 --> 2:44:47.620]  happened to us. So I asked you now, are you going to step up and expose the dual order
[2:44:47.620 --> 2:44:53.260]  even more? I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts. The front lines of
[2:44:53.260 --> 2:45:00.500]  the fight is info wars.com. It has been noted by many a historian. The first casualty of
[2:45:00.500 --> 2:45:08.380]  war is the truth. The next big casualty isn't even the people that die. No, that invariably
[2:45:08.380 --> 2:45:16.300]  follows. But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and
[2:45:16.300 --> 2:45:22.020]  massive censorship. And now across the world, the United States to Europe, legislation's
[2:45:22.020 --> 2:45:32.220]  being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored.
[2:45:32.220 --> 2:45:37.740]  You can be arrested. You can be a president. And of course now Canada's introduced legislation
[2:45:37.740 --> 2:45:43.860]  that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in
[2:45:43.860 --> 2:45:49.740]  hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[2:45:49.740 --> 2:45:54.220]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes info

[2:47:14.700 --> 2:47:22.020]  Welcome in Alex Jones. Thanks, Alex for being here. Emerald, it's great to be here. Congratulations
[2:47:22.020 --> 2:47:26.620]  on your great popular show and the great work that you guys are doing in independent media.
[2:47:26.620 --> 2:47:31.900]  And for you never compromising or backing down, you know, these very same intelligence chiefs
[2:47:31.900 --> 2:47:36.340]  spied on Trump when he was in his campaign, when he was president elect, when he was president.
[2:47:36.340 --> 2:47:43.820]  We knew this because we actually got documents from the DEA in 2017 showing that Trump was
[2:47:43.820 --> 2:47:48.660]  being spied on because they had access to the NSA database and knew that. And so we
[2:47:48.660 --> 2:47:52.660]  first broke that. So they lied about that. They lied about Hunter Biden's laptop, even
[2:47:52.660 --> 2:47:57.900]  though it was thousands of photos and videos. And they said that Trump was making it up
[2:47:57.900 --> 2:48:02.740]  with the Russians had had basically deep faked all these videos that were smoking crack and
[2:48:02.740 --> 2:48:09.140]  having reported sex with underage girls. But but now Oh, the New York Times says it's real.
[2:48:09.140 --> 2:48:14.140]  And so now we all admit, Oh, well, if they say now, now it's real, just incredible how
[2:48:14.140 --> 2:48:19.100]  much these people lie by design. And it all goes back, as you were saying earlier, to
[2:48:19.100 --> 2:48:23.580]  Ukraine, where a lot of these leftists have been laundering billions and billions of USA
[2:48:23.580 --> 2:48:28.900]  money that goes to Ukraine that goes right back into their pockets, not just the Bidens,
[2:48:28.900 --> 2:48:36.420]  but the Pelosi's Mitt Romney's son, dozens of neocons and leftist children, wives and
[2:48:36.420 --> 2:48:41.780]  husbands are getting all together billions of dollars of US tax money that sent their
[2:48:41.780 --> 2:48:46.500]  laundered back. So there's 13 billion plus that's going this 800 million that's going
[2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:50.140]  these billions of dollars that gets sent every week now we're hearing about. That's on top
[2:48:50.140 --> 2:48:55.900]  of the tens of billions already sent to Ukraine in the last decade, since Obama started his
[2:48:55.900 --> 2:48:57.740]  big scam in Ukraine.
[2:48:57.740 --> 2:49:05.260]  Yeah, speaking of that, I'd like to play a soundbite from Daily Mail's reporting on
[2:49:05.260 --> 2:49:10.340]  the laptop. Remember, they had independently confirmed it some time ago. And in this in
[2:49:10.340 --> 2:49:16.420]  this video, Hunter Biden is confirming that he actually lost another laptop to Russians
[2:49:16.420 --> 2:49:21.180]  and he talks about how much money he'll make if his dad becomes president. Listen.
[2:49:21.180 --> 2:49:41.140]  I think he's on the phone with the computer. I think the three of them, the three guys
[2:49:41.140 --> 2:50:00.860]  are on the phone. So Alex, while the media was trying to say the laptop was Russian disinformation,
[2:50:00.860 --> 2:50:05.820]  there was videos on the laptop where Hunter Biden was admitting that Russians had acquired
[2:50:05.820 --> 2:50:12.100]  one of his laptops as well and talking about potential blackmail. Well, look, that's just
[2:50:12.100 --> 2:50:16.940]  him trying to cover himself. We now know exactly what's happening. In fact, this all came out
[2:50:16.940 --> 2:50:22.500]  a year and a half ago. I wouldn't look at the laptop myself since so much child porn
[2:50:22.500 --> 2:50:28.100]  on it that was confirmed, but the state police, the FBI, Rudolph Giuliani, they looked at it,
[2:50:28.100 --> 2:50:34.460]  select things that weren't illegal, did get released to a lot of folks. But if you expand
[2:50:34.460 --> 2:50:39.740]  on that, the real thing that they were doing when you listen to it is him talking about
[2:50:39.740 --> 2:50:46.740]  Chinese intelligence and him talking about how he works for the head of Chinese intelligence.
[2:50:46.740 --> 2:50:52.420]  Now the head of Chinese intelligence has disappeared and now the FBI is calling his dad asking
[2:50:52.420 --> 2:50:56.580]  about Chinese intelligence. So they have it. They know they're double agents. They took
[2:50:56.580 --> 2:51:01.740]  Russian money. They took Ukraine money. They took Chinese money. They're not Chinese agents
[2:51:01.740 --> 2:51:07.260]  or Russian agents, Ukrainian agents or Saudi Arabian agents. They are people selling out
[2:51:07.260 --> 2:51:13.300]  America as profiteers, the highest bidder. They are the worst type of scum. They're not
[2:51:13.300 --> 2:51:16.980]  ideologs that they call me as China's better than us. They're not ideologs that they think
[2:51:16.980 --> 2:51:21.620]  authoritarian Russia is better than us. They literally are there like a vending machine
[2:51:21.620 --> 2:51:29.980]  that you put money into and then you get favors and the sellout of America and American interest.
[2:51:29.980 --> 2:51:34.740]  You give the Bidens 10 million, you literally get a billion in aid. Same thing with Hillary
[2:51:34.740 --> 2:51:39.060]  Clinton and her foundation that raised tens of billions of dollars while she was at the
[2:51:39.060 --> 2:51:43.260]  State Department and we have the emails, the ones she didn't destroy, the ones we were
[2:51:43.260 --> 2:51:47.980]  able to get, where they say, okay, how do we talk to her? $1 million. $1 million to talk
[2:51:47.980 --> 2:51:51.900]  to Hillary. And then, okay, we want $20 million and then you'll get what you want at the State
[2:51:51.900 --> 2:51:57.460]  Department. All of this is life in prison. In fact, it's worse than that. It's freezing.
[2:51:57.460 --> 2:52:02.500]  So this is very, very, very serious. And that's why the globalists wanted Biden because Trump
[2:52:02.500 --> 2:52:06.420]  wasn't compromised. Trump wasn't corrupt. You can't buy Trump off. He's straight up
[2:52:06.420 --> 2:52:10.780]  business guy. Okay. So that's why they had to steal the election, get rid of Trump is
[2:52:10.780 --> 2:52:15.740]  because they needed to get this fully compromised individual in and all the other compromised
[2:52:15.740 --> 2:52:21.060]  individuals under them so they could do whatever they want.
[2:52:21.060 --> 2:52:25.220]  So Alex, why is the New York Times now coming out with this story? There's always a reason
[2:52:25.220 --> 2:52:31.340]  to it. Well, the New York Times is getting ready to basically help the system get rid
[2:52:31.340 --> 2:52:35.940]  of Biden. He's either going to have a stroke or a heart attack or die or be assassinated.
[2:52:35.940 --> 2:52:40.700]  He's only good to them dead or out of office now. He's deteriorated. They can blame all
[2:52:40.700 --> 2:52:46.860]  the problems on him of the inflation and the gas prices and the war and then bring in Kamala
[2:52:46.860 --> 2:52:52.700]  Harris, it's an even bigger puppet. And of course, under that same system, under that
[2:52:52.700 --> 2:52:59.420]  same system, Nancy Pelosi would then be the vice president. And so they just want to cascade
[2:52:59.420 --> 2:53:03.660]  of controllable puppets. They'll do whatever they're told. They're totally compromised
[2:53:03.660 --> 2:53:08.740]  that then they can flush once they're done using them.
[2:53:08.740 --> 2:53:13.620]  You know, I do want to talk to you about Ukraine because back in October, you actually predicted
[2:53:13.620 --> 2:53:18.700]  this war. In fact, we have a clip from your show where you were talking about this in
[2:53:18.700 --> 2:53:26.100]  October. Let's listen. But we're looking at a giant war in February right now. Currently,
[2:53:26.100 --> 2:53:31.260]  that's the projections with the top people on the earth who claim they're not with the
[2:53:31.260 --> 2:53:40.220]  New World Order Combine is war in February. How did you know that, Alex? How did you know
[2:53:40.220 --> 2:53:46.420]  that then? Well, I know a lot of people that work at the CIA and all the people that work
[2:53:46.420 --> 2:53:51.180]  in army special operations. And they said, look for Putin to invade before the end of
[2:53:51.180 --> 2:53:57.220]  February, because that's when it falls and the spring starts to come. And the tanks and
[2:53:57.220 --> 2:54:02.820]  troops would bog down in that famous Ukrainian black soil that creates so many great crops
[2:54:02.820 --> 2:54:10.580]  and is 20% of the world's grain supply. And then I talked to some billionaires, I know,
[2:54:10.580 --> 2:54:13.940]  and some people I know that have attended Bilderberg Group. And they said, yeah, how
[2:54:13.940 --> 2:54:18.620]  do you know that? That's super-classified information. And then I was able through another
[2:54:18.620 --> 2:54:23.660]  source to talk to somebody that actually knows one of the richest people in the world. And
[2:54:23.660 --> 2:54:27.540]  I said, please ask them if you've heard this. And they said, yeah, the stock market's going
[2:54:27.540 --> 2:54:31.060]  to go down in late February. Of course, I don't know any stocks. I don't ever want to
[2:54:31.060 --> 2:54:36.140]  be accused of insider trading. But I was just told, basically, look for a massive dip in
[2:54:36.140 --> 2:54:40.300]  the stock market in February. So I thought I would just go on air and tell everybody
[2:54:40.300 --> 2:54:48.500]  that, so that the general public would be able to have tomorrow's news today.
[2:54:48.500 --> 2:54:56.620]  And Alex, the news today is that Russia is asking the UN Security Council to review documents.
[2:54:56.620 --> 2:55:03.980]  They say prove the bio weapons lab narrative in Ukraine. Of course, the corporate media
[2:55:03.980 --> 2:55:08.940]  have been trying to downplay that. Suggest, again, is disinformation. Do you think Russia
[2:55:08.940 --> 2:55:11.220]  has proof of these bio weapons labs?
[2:55:11.220 --> 2:55:14.820]  Well, absolutely. I don't need to listen to Vladimir Putin. I don't need to listen to
[2:55:14.820 --> 2:55:18.380]  the Russians because they're like any government. They lie. He said he wasn't going to invade
[2:55:18.380 --> 2:55:22.900]  Ukraine. He said he wasn't going to stay there very long once he did. So Putin's not an
[2:55:22.900 --> 2:55:29.900]  angel. He's not perfect, in my view. But what is reality is our own corporate media in 2003,
[2:55:29.900 --> 2:55:35.460]  2004, and 2005, when Obama was just a U.S. senator and then when he was president, he
[2:55:35.460 --> 2:55:41.740]  sponsored the bills for $3 billion to take the old Russian bio labs there that had all
[2:55:41.740 --> 2:55:47.180]  these deadly pathogens, like black flag, anthrax, you name it, and to weaponize them. And they
[2:55:47.180 --> 2:55:51.900]  bragged about this in the Washington Post. So on my own show, at infowars.com daily,
[2:55:51.900 --> 2:55:57.020]  I showed a whole stack of mainstream news articles from 2003, 2004, and 2005. I showed
[2:55:57.020 --> 2:56:02.100]  the bill that Obama sponsored and got passed as a senator from Illinois. And then I went
[2:56:02.100 --> 2:56:07.460]  forward and showed a documentary that's on infowars.com right now out of Bulgaria that's
[2:56:07.460 --> 2:56:14.460]  in English from 2018, where it shows the bio weapon labs with Peter Dazik working there
[2:56:14.460 --> 2:56:21.060]  with the Eco Alliance, creating gain of function and creating gene-edited spike proteins used
[2:56:21.060 --> 2:56:26.500]  in COVID-19 that were then patented, of course, in 2016 by Moderna. So all of this was already
[2:56:26.500 --> 2:56:31.820]  hidden in plain view. Those labs were Soviet. The U.S. took them over. The U.S. continued
[2:56:31.820 --> 2:56:38.220]  to weaponize them. That's a fact, like Dallas, Texas being in northeast Texas or D.C., you
[2:56:38.220 --> 2:56:42.340]  know, you know, existing. This is real. This is on record. And they want to gaslight us
[2:56:42.340 --> 2:56:47.900]  and tell us it doesn't exist. Though the former ambassador, current deputy head of the State
[2:56:47.900 --> 2:56:52.380]  Department, Victoria Newland, came out two weeks ago, as you know, and said a week and
[2:56:52.380 --> 2:56:57.540]  a half ago, started erupt and said that these labs are real. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:56:57.540 --> 2:57:04.020]  Yeah, Rubio tried to fix that for her, though. So I just want to clarify for our audience,
[2:57:04.020 --> 2:57:07.740]  you're saying that Peter Dazik of Eco Health Alliance, who was tied to the Wuhan lab, was
[2:57:07.740 --> 2:57:17.460]  also tied to labs in Ukraine. Absolutely. Interesting. Now, on this, you talk a lot
[2:57:17.460 --> 2:57:21.620]  about the global reset, right? The great reset. All right, ladies and gentlemen, that's the
[2:57:21.620 --> 2:57:29.060]  Alex Jones was right interview on Frank speech with Emerald Robinson. And you can go to Frank
[2:57:29.060 --> 2:57:37.460]  speech TV to see the entire interview. Alex Jones and Emerald Robinson. The Alex Jones

[2:57:42.180 --> 2:57:46.420]  the war room in an hour.
[2:57:46.420 --> 2:57:50.980]  You know, it's a fact. And I'm not bragging when I say it. It's just true that info wars
[2:57:50.980 --> 2:57:58.980]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populace
[2:57:58.980 --> 2:58:06.460]  resistance against their transhumanist anti human program. And man, our work is really

[2:59:48.460 --> 3:00:03.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:03.300 --> 3:00:09.020]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Glad to be with you. I'm Kate Daly from cakedalyradio.com
[3:00:09.020 --> 3:00:13.300]  and boy, I have a lot to talk about today. So we got to get started. I was sent a meme
[3:00:13.300 --> 3:00:17.980]  by several friends. In fact, it happened to be the same meme, which was kind of funny.
[3:00:17.980 --> 3:00:24.420]  And it was one of those memes where we should apologize to the conspirers, right? Um, for
[3:00:24.420 --> 3:00:32.540]  being right. And I wanted to say you think you think I interviewed Mallory Millett and
[3:00:32.540 --> 3:00:38.580]  Mallory Millett was the sister of Kate Millett, who conspired. Yeah, with 15 other horrific
[3:00:38.580 --> 3:00:45.300]  women to ruin our culture back seventies and the world that was their goal with feminism.
[3:00:45.300 --> 3:00:50.140]  And Kate was in fact a mental patient who for days at a time would talk to little green
[3:00:50.140 --> 3:00:56.500]  men. Okay. And she was also an atheist. She was a lesbian and she was credited with bringing
[3:00:56.500 --> 3:01:07.660]  in Marxism under the guise of feminism. Okay. And so when she died, uh, 2017, Kathleen Turner
[3:01:07.660 --> 3:01:12.660]  and Hillary, everybody was at her funeral, right? And, uh, and, and here she'd been on
[3:01:12.660 --> 3:01:17.140]  the planet for 87 years, absolutely ruining it. So her sister goes around and tries to
[3:01:17.140 --> 3:01:22.820]  talk about what she did and how she did it. But it was definitely a conspiracy. It was
[3:01:22.820 --> 3:01:29.580]  a conspiracy of 15 women who plotted together under the group now, and O. W., to go and
[3:01:29.580 --> 3:01:34.980]  to figure out how they were going to dominate the world with their new message. And if you're
[3:01:34.980 --> 3:01:41.420]  wondering why we're watching a male swimmer tuck his privates and Donna Wigg and win the
[3:01:41.420 --> 3:01:49.820]  best medal in swimming, then you have to go back to, um, to Kate Millett and her journey
[3:01:49.820 --> 3:01:54.580]  of, of what she was all about. I'm not going to be talking about her today, but I wanted
[3:01:54.580 --> 3:02:00.140]  to also kind of reference her for a second because her life, what she was about was a
[3:02:00.140 --> 3:02:07.860]  total conspiracy with 10 other women to basically bring in Satanism, bring in, um, transgender
[3:02:07.860 --> 3:02:12.980]  movement to normalize it instead of being something that, you know, somebody should probably
[3:02:12.980 --> 3:02:17.580]  seek counseling for. Um, and then of course she was well funded. Well, who was she well
[3:02:17.580 --> 3:02:22.900]  funded by? She was well funded by the Rockefellers, the Ford Foundation and CIA money. Gloria
[3:02:22.900 --> 3:02:29.660]  Steinem even says, Hey, CIA money was available and free and they were given it to us in droves.
[3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:35.620]  And of course Gloria Steinem was a paid protester. That's how it started out too. So these two
[3:02:35.620 --> 3:02:41.100]  women really, if you want to look at our culture, we're one of the reasons that, uh, they conspired
[3:02:41.100 --> 3:02:46.700]  with the right money and they were able to pull off what we're dealing with right now
[3:02:46.700 --> 3:02:54.300]  in our, in our history is a cultural revolution in the very worst way. Okay. And well funded
[3:02:54.300 --> 3:03:01.220]  plans. Isn't that what we're always talking about? Right. So I was asked recently if COVID
[3:03:01.220 --> 3:03:07.660]  was the largest lie that we've ever been told. Well, not really. I mean, it is because it's
[3:03:07.660 --> 3:03:12.460]  worldwide and it's definitely something they all got together on and, and conspired to
[3:03:12.460 --> 3:03:17.340]  do under the direction of the CDC, right? Which you think, well, why is an American
[3:03:17.340 --> 3:03:21.860]  agency like this telling the world what to do and getting some direction from the who
[3:03:21.860 --> 3:03:26.940]  working with them. But yeah, it was a very, very large conspiracy. Actually, there's two
[3:03:26.940 --> 3:03:31.860]  conspiracies that we don't really talk about as conspiracies. And I've always wondered
[3:03:31.860 --> 3:03:38.700]  why number one was the Great Depression and number two was the polio lie. And yes, there
[3:03:38.700 --> 3:03:46.220]  was a lie about polio, not polio. Of course, you know, there's so much to this story. And
[3:03:46.220 --> 3:03:50.100]  when I come back, I'll go into more detail, but think about this for a second while we're
[3:03:50.100 --> 3:03:55.860]  on this break. The two things that we don't talk about as being two of the biggest conspiracies
[3:03:55.860 --> 3:04:03.020]  that actually affect our lives, money and health, right, are being used right now, right?
[3:04:03.020 --> 3:04:09.380]  Didn't we just have a bank failure drill? And aren't we looking at COVID and other health
[3:04:09.380 --> 3:04:15.540]  emergencies and vaccines to save the day? Isn't it interesting that the Great Depression
[3:04:15.540 --> 3:04:20.660]  and polio are never discussed? In fact, when polio is discussed, it's only discussed in
[3:04:20.660 --> 3:04:26.980]  the way that says, Hey, polio, if it wasn't for the vaccines, we wouldn't all be alive.
[3:04:26.980 --> 3:04:31.660]  Oh, I have some problems with that little narrative there. When I come back, I want to
[3:04:31.660 --> 3:04:36.820]  talk about this. And then I also want to talk about Russian, Russians and Russia and our
[3:04:36.820 --> 3:04:42.620]  relationship with Russia through the years, because it's not what we think. So I'm going
[3:04:42.620 --> 3:04:46.700]  to come right back. I'm Kay Daly, your guest host on the Alex Jones show today. Be right
[3:04:46.700 --> 3:05:12.900]  back.
[3:05:12.900 --> 3:05:37.900]  Thank you very much for joining us today, and I'll see you in the next video.
[3:05:37.900 --> 3:06:07.820]  Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Kay Daly, your guest host.
[3:06:07.820 --> 3:06:13.380]  And so we're talking about two big conspiracies that were never really talked about as conspiracies
[3:06:13.380 --> 3:06:19.100]  for some oddball reason. And number one, we had the Great Depression. And the reason I'm
[3:06:19.100 --> 3:06:23.060]  going back to this, well, you'll figure this out by the end of this broadcast today, but
[3:06:23.060 --> 3:06:27.980]  there's a reason I wanted to talk about this. And the Great Depression was really a plan
[3:06:27.980 --> 3:06:33.500]  to oust the small independent banks in America. Was it not? We had the plan of the Federal
[3:06:33.500 --> 3:06:39.860]  Reserve, which is neither federal nor a reserve. And all of a sudden we had this Great Depression.
[3:06:39.860 --> 3:06:44.140]  And the Fed engineered the Great Depression by raising rates, right? And it just sort
[3:06:44.140 --> 3:06:50.380]  of self-destructs it just at the right moment to bring about the Federal Reserve as really
[3:06:50.380 --> 3:06:56.460]  the savior of the banking industry. It was a complete overhaul. Up to that point, we
[3:06:56.460 --> 3:07:00.540]  had smaller independent banks that worked independently from each other. You put your
[3:07:00.540 --> 3:07:05.380]  money in the bank, you go get your money out of the bank. We had a totally different system.
[3:07:05.380 --> 3:07:09.980]  Now all central banks are tied together by what's called the Bank for International Settlements,
[3:07:09.980 --> 3:07:17.260]  right? BIS. And the BIS or BS is a globalist institution through and through. And the globalist
[3:07:17.260 --> 3:07:23.300]  agenda really seeks to trigger what they call the Great Reset, another overhaul, right?
[3:07:23.300 --> 3:07:28.140]  Isn't that what we're looking at? A financial overhaul, a complete reformation of the global
[3:07:28.140 --> 3:07:33.500]  economy and capitalism, which is horrific for us because what it means is no autonomy,
[3:07:33.500 --> 3:07:37.740]  absolute tracking. And we know this. We've been talking a lot about this. So what did
[3:07:37.740 --> 3:07:42.980]  King Frautalot just warn us about? Well, King Frautalot warned us about a cyber attack
[3:07:42.980 --> 3:07:48.780]  from none other than Russia. Of course, blaming Russia already that would trigger our bank
[3:07:48.780 --> 3:07:54.300]  failure, okay? This is the drill four months ago that they did, not cyber polygon back
[3:07:54.300 --> 3:07:59.140]  in July. Not talking about that one. We all knew that was what that was. And that's horrific
[3:07:59.140 --> 3:08:04.900]  enough actually. But what I'm talking about is collective strength, the collective strength
[3:08:04.900 --> 3:08:11.540]  drill. Israel hosts cyber pandemic exercise, simulating a cyber attack on global financial
[3:08:11.540 --> 3:08:18.980]  systems with 10 countries, the IMF, the World Bank, and of course, the BIS. Call it collective
[3:08:18.980 --> 3:08:23.260]  strength because they're all going to band together to save banking, but they're not
[3:08:23.260 --> 3:08:28.100]  really going to save banking. They're going to change banking. And it's a simulated attack
[3:08:28.100 --> 3:08:33.220]  on the financial sector continuation of global efforts, they said in their headlines to prepare
[3:08:33.220 --> 3:08:39.460]  the public and private sectors for a coming cyber pandemic that would wreak havoc all
[3:08:39.460 --> 3:08:44.180]  of society. Because if you take down banks, you're going to do that, right? And of course,
[3:08:44.180 --> 3:08:50.140]  in that, what they plan to do was to basically give you payments, free payments, you know,
[3:08:50.140 --> 3:08:55.340]  I'm not free payments, I should say that differently. And they would give you a reprieve from making
[3:08:55.340 --> 3:09:00.140]  payments. And that would be sort of your little payoff, kind of like how COVID dollars were
[3:09:00.140 --> 3:09:04.620]  dished out, right? This would be your payoff for kind of hush money really, you know, let's
[3:09:04.620 --> 3:09:09.580]  just keep the peasants happy. They don't have to pay their loan payments for a while. But
[3:09:09.580 --> 3:09:15.180]  if you want your stuff that you've been paying on for years, and you want it bad enough,
[3:09:15.180 --> 3:09:20.060]  you're going to join the digital banking system that we have now for you. Because of, of course,
[3:09:20.060 --> 3:09:26.620]  it's completely, you know, safe now, digital money is the way to go because we'll never
[3:09:26.620 --> 3:09:33.420]  have a bank failure again. Yeah. Right. Okay. And so in order to get your stuff and get
[3:09:33.420 --> 3:09:37.180]  the titles on your stuff that you've been paying off, like your mortgage and your cars,
[3:09:37.180 --> 3:09:41.740]  you're going to have to endure the non payment that's supposed to be your payoff, and then
[3:09:41.740 --> 3:09:47.620]  go into a loan possibly with digital banking. They had all of this sort of outlined in their
[3:09:47.620 --> 3:09:52.820]  little drill. I love drills because they didn't, they make me feel cozy. You know, I love them.
[3:09:52.820 --> 3:09:58.260]  It's like a foreshadowing of what's going to happen. Basically, I wish the people would do
[3:09:58.260 --> 3:10:03.300]  that to them. You know, we always get these drills and I always wonder why we get these drills over
[3:10:03.300 --> 3:10:07.460]  and over again, telling us what they're going to do. And then they do it. Same with COVID-19,
[3:10:07.460 --> 3:10:12.660]  right? That drill happened in New York a few months before COVID-19 came upon us.
[3:10:12.660 --> 3:10:19.300]  Right. The vaccine was already being manufactured sort of thing. Okay. So coming back to this,
[3:10:19.300 --> 3:10:23.460]  I just wanted to talk about this for just a moment because the other thing rarely talked about is
[3:10:23.460 --> 3:10:29.140]  polio. And this is really important. Most people don't realize this polio was very, very similar
[3:10:29.140 --> 3:10:35.860]  to COVID because people didn't realize at the time that polio only affected 1%. I know you probably
[3:10:35.860 --> 3:10:41.140]  thought from the headlines and the fear attacks that this was everybody coming down with polio,
[3:10:41.140 --> 3:10:47.700]  especially if you were a child, right? Well, only 0.5 of the 1% were paralyzed and 0.5 of
[3:10:47.700 --> 3:10:54.900]  the 1% that died. So we're looking at a very, very small percentage. But did you realize this is
[3:10:54.900 --> 3:11:03.460]  pretty much with everything? It's the 1%. It's always the 1%. And 99.8 or 9% of the time, you're
[3:11:03.460 --> 3:11:10.020]  just fine. So about 25% might have gotten like a flu or flu symptoms, but that was about it.
[3:11:10.020 --> 3:11:16.660]  So it wasn't a major killer and it didn't maim scores of tens of thousands of people. And so it
[3:11:16.660 --> 3:11:24.500]  was used. And that's really the message. Polio was used. It was already waning by the year 1955
[3:11:24.500 --> 3:11:30.260]  and almost gone when they introduced the polio vaccine. But the vaccine was actually giving polio
[3:11:30.260 --> 3:11:36.820]  and so the fear ramped up. Oh, everybody's getting it. Oh my gosh. So no one ever asks how the polio
[3:11:36.820 --> 3:11:42.740]  suddenly spiked. And I've talked about this on the show before. They just figured it organically
[3:11:42.740 --> 3:11:48.100]  happened, but for no apparent reason. But there's always causation. There's always a cause. We were
[3:11:48.100 --> 3:11:54.100]  working with brand new antibiotics right after World War II. And pharma was becoming king after
[3:11:54.100 --> 3:12:00.500]  Hitler because Hitler was using pharma on the juice. If you wanted them dead, why not just kill
[3:12:00.500 --> 3:12:07.220]  them? Nope. He was experimenting on them for pharma. And pharma was ousting all the homeopathic
[3:12:07.220 --> 3:12:12.100]  routes that we had always used. So pharma was going to come save the day, right? After they were
[3:12:12.100 --> 3:12:19.140]  using and killing the Jews and experimenting on them. So the polio vaccine was now a huge cover
[3:12:19.140 --> 3:12:24.020]  for a new vaccine program that they were going to implement. And that would become one of the most
[3:12:24.020 --> 3:12:29.060]  profitable businesses in the world. We all know pharma, right? Then pharma feeds pharma.
[3:12:29.060 --> 3:12:36.020]  So the more shots you get, the more weak your immune system gets. Now one and three have cancer,
[3:12:36.020 --> 3:12:43.700]  right? They even sent out infected polio shots, 90 million of them, to the country at that time
[3:12:43.700 --> 3:12:50.740]  in 1955, which they actually admitted later in 2007. But the fact is, is they sent them out.
[3:12:50.740 --> 3:12:57.300]  They were absolutely, you know, infected. And then of course we had the war on cancer. So the war
[3:12:57.300 --> 3:13:03.700]  on cancer comes up and Nixon declares a war on cancer a decade later, a decade and a half later.
[3:13:03.700 --> 3:13:10.020]  So the more shots you get, the more your immune system becomes weak. They lay out a new very
[3:13:10.020 --> 3:13:15.140]  rigorous vaccine program for kids to go to school. The more pills you take, then you have to take
[3:13:15.140 --> 3:13:19.380]  more pills because of the side effects, right? It's kind of how it works. Pharma feeds pharma.
[3:13:20.180 --> 3:13:24.420]  There's a meme that I love because it states the obvious. There's a woman standing there in her
[3:13:24.420 --> 3:13:29.460]  seventies and she said, I have two vaccines as she's carrying a sign. The person next to him
[3:13:29.460 --> 3:13:36.020]  is about my age and it says I had nine vaccines. The person next to her is from the eighties,
[3:13:36.020 --> 3:13:41.460]  right? Born in the eighties and says I had 14 vaccines. And then you have a child that says
[3:13:41.460 --> 3:13:49.140]  I have up to 98 vaccines. Now ask yourself the obvious question. How is the woman that 70
[3:13:49.140 --> 3:13:58.100]  still standing and alive if in fact she didn't get those other 96 shots? Do you see what I mean?
[3:13:58.100 --> 3:14:03.140]  She's thriving. She's doing great. She's alive. How in the world did that happen?
[3:14:03.860 --> 3:14:10.580]  And so we have to ask the obvious. So when we finally got to a time with great sanitation,
[3:14:10.580 --> 3:14:15.620]  right, as the greatest that's ever been in America because it was bad sanitation that
[3:14:15.620 --> 3:14:22.020]  used to spread disease, we introduce a massive vaccine program. Why? Because we believed it.
[3:14:22.660 --> 3:14:27.460]  We believed it. We always felt like everyone else was getting polio, so we needed to be part of
[3:14:27.460 --> 3:14:33.060]  this and do this, right? So people were flocking to go get these shots, not really realizing that
[3:14:33.060 --> 3:14:38.420]  it was only 1% that it was really affecting. But they're so good at lying, they were able to talk
[3:14:38.420 --> 3:14:43.700]  us into the fact that we had to have these polio shots and that we still have to have them,
[3:14:43.700 --> 3:14:49.780]  which is utterly crazy. And so, yes, people can get polio, but it's really, really rare.
[3:14:50.980 --> 3:14:58.020]  So then we had the two world wars that were planned. We had the new CIA. We had two big
[3:14:58.020 --> 3:15:03.300]  conspiracies that changed us, even though we hardly ever talked about it. We never talked about
[3:15:03.300 --> 3:15:07.860]  the Great Depression changing our banking system forever in the worst way possible.
[3:15:08.420 --> 3:15:11.700]  Well, I don't know. The Great Resets could be another worst way possible.
[3:15:11.700 --> 3:15:17.780]  But then we had pharma come in and interject a vaccine program that weakened us,
[3:15:17.780 --> 3:15:22.740]  that weakened human beings. And that was truly the goal of the vaccine program.
[3:15:23.380 --> 3:15:28.340]  I mean, come on. All of the things that they give you vaccines for, all the STDs they give
[3:15:28.340 --> 3:15:32.820]  infants, I mean, come on. You can't really believe that saving them from an STD they'll
[3:15:32.820 --> 3:15:38.100]  never come in contact with, right? I'll be right back because I want to talk about some more bigger
[3:15:38.100 --> 3:15:42.660]  fiercer lies. We need to talk about these things because the more we realize that government lies,
[3:15:43.220 --> 3:15:48.340]  then the more we can see what's coming. And this is why we even have false flag alerts now,
[3:15:48.340 --> 3:16:08.340]  because people are on to them. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host. I'll be right back on the Alex Jones show.
[3:16:18.340 --> 3:16:24.580]  that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light
[3:16:24.580 --> 3:16:32.740]  of the sun. It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[3:16:33.460 --> 3:16:40.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future destiny of humanity is
[3:16:40.340 --> 3:16:44.980]  upon us. Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part
[3:16:44.980 --> 3:16:50.580]  of the World ID and Carbon Taxes. Things only get worse from here if we submit. They only get
[3:16:50.580 --> 3:16:57.060]  better if we resist and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance. Introducing

[3:17:46.340 --> 3:17:50.740]  your body's natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air. The globalists are hoping you don't
[3:17:50.740 --> 3:17:57.620]  take action. Take action now, InfoWarsStore.com. With the world awakening, I think what's important
[3:17:57.620 --> 3:18:01.540]  that we were right to prevent them right now, take advantage of this moment and I have an idea
[3:18:01.540 --> 3:18:05.700]  that something everybody can do with every listener can do. I think it'd be powerful and effective
[3:18:05.700 --> 3:18:11.460]  for us to, you know, hang banners over highways. Imagine a champion on a piece of land, it says
[3:18:11.460 --> 3:18:16.420]  Alex Jones is right, InfoWars.com. We stand with the truckers, the rest out or whatever.
[3:18:16.420 --> 3:18:21.540]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this. Yes, now is the time in your small town or your
[3:18:21.540 --> 3:18:27.060]  big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs
[3:18:27.060 --> 3:18:31.860]  over highways and it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend people say on these banner
[3:18:31.860 --> 3:18:36.900]  hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all, help just as many people as possible to form a rest out,
[3:18:36.900 --> 3:18:40.900]  rest out, swap. The vaccine is poison. There's tons of things. I'd say just keep it short, keep
[3:18:40.900 --> 3:18:46.340]  it concise. No, I agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison. Beautiful.
[3:18:46.340 --> 3:18:49.940]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be effective though. That's what
[3:18:49.940 --> 3:18:54.900]  I'm calling about. God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[3:18:54.900 --> 3:19:01.460]  Thank you so much. So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably
[3:19:01.460 --> 3:19:07.540]  not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for InfowarsStore.com.
[3:19:07.540 --> 3:19:13.380]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going.
[3:19:13.380 --> 3:19:19.060]  You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to
[3:19:19.060 --> 3:19:24.180]  keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy,
[3:19:24.180 --> 3:19:29.140]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then every day now, I'm taking Dr.
[3:19:29.140 --> 3:19:35.220]  Jones' Sorilis. I have bad joints. Thanks, mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra
[3:19:35.220 --> 3:19:40.820]  support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release
[3:19:40.820 --> 3:19:46.260]  capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to
[3:19:46.260 --> 3:19:51.380]  take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need
[3:19:51.380 --> 3:19:55.380]  for every day and Sorilis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[3:19:58.660 --> 3:20:04.660]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:11.620 --> 3:20:16.820]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones show. And of course, I'm Kate Dahle from KateDahleRadio.com.
[3:20:16.820 --> 3:20:22.740]  Let me just start here with this segment because I know I'll take some people off. I usually offend
[3:20:22.740 --> 3:20:29.620]  somebody. Don't worry, I'll get to you if I haven't offended you yet. We had two World Wars.
[3:20:29.620 --> 3:20:35.140]  The CIA got ahold of the media. We knew this, right? Or some people knew this. I think a lot
[3:20:35.140 --> 3:20:40.420]  of people were kind of just trying to run their families and work hard and raise kids. If that
[3:20:40.420 --> 3:20:46.420]  wasn't hard enough, we've had government lie after government lie. But once they took Kennedy
[3:20:46.420 --> 3:20:55.380]  out, I think when we didn't, as a populace, now 60% of America doesn't believe the official story.
[3:20:55.380 --> 3:21:00.980]  I mean, a lot of times we're looking at the official story and America's not buying it.
[3:21:00.980 --> 3:21:05.780]  And that should tell you volumes that a lot of Americans are thinking like most people do.
[3:21:05.780 --> 3:21:11.060]  Wait a minute, there's some holes in that story. But what's interesting is, is now that the CIA
[3:21:11.060 --> 3:21:16.340]  owns the media, the field is really wide open to make the lies even bigger because they can.
[3:21:16.980 --> 3:21:21.060]  They can. And they can get away with it. And that's what's sad. And this is why we need to wake
[3:21:21.060 --> 3:21:25.620]  people up. And I hate the term wake people up. I think it's so overused. But the problem is that
[3:21:26.180 --> 3:21:32.020]  there are a considerable amount of people that are still asleep and do not realize they put
[3:21:32.020 --> 3:21:37.940]  all their faith in government. I put my faith in God. I've got a pretty good conviction on that one.
[3:21:37.940 --> 3:21:42.260]  But they have a good conviction that government's going to run in and save them,
[3:21:42.260 --> 3:21:49.620]  even though history does not back them up. And so when we went to the moon, and I mean,
[3:21:49.620 --> 3:21:55.300]  it was impossible to do that in the 1960s. You remember the 1960s, right? We had rabbit ears
[3:21:55.300 --> 3:22:03.220]  on our TV sets. In the 70s, I was the baby of the family. And I was in charge of being the
[3:22:03.220 --> 3:22:08.100]  remote control for my family. But of course, you know, I was the little one. So I always got sent
[3:22:08.100 --> 3:22:15.620]  to turn the TV knob, you know? And so in this time, they said that we had to win this war with Russia.
[3:22:15.620 --> 3:22:23.140]  There was a war with Russia in technology. And I don't even think Russia had that technology.
[3:22:23.140 --> 3:22:27.140]  But that's another story. We'll get to that in just a moment. But they went to the moon in a foil
[3:22:27.140 --> 3:22:33.860]  wrapped tin can in unpressurized spacesuits in a time when we really had zero technology at that
[3:22:33.860 --> 3:22:40.580]  point to do something like that, to pull that off. The only distance that we had traveled to by 1969
[3:22:40.580 --> 3:22:48.180]  was 400 miles in space and back. A year and a half before the moon launch, we burned to death
[3:22:48.180 --> 3:22:53.940]  three astronauts in a capsule just in a single mishap that I think could have been avoided.
[3:22:53.940 --> 3:23:04.020]  But we flew 239,000 miles to the unknown to the moon and were able to not only walk on the moon,
[3:23:04.020 --> 3:23:10.980]  but then we did it on a single tank of gas in an unshielded spaceship and then flew 234,000 miles
[3:23:10.980 --> 3:23:17.460]  back. Then there was the main ship giving birth to the lunar module. Dave McGowan has wonderful
[3:23:17.460 --> 3:23:23.300]  things on this Center for Informed Citizen. And he's done, he did some great research before his
[3:23:23.300 --> 3:23:28.580]  death. And that untested lunar module then flying down, making a perfect landing on the surface of
[3:23:28.580 --> 3:23:34.340]  the moon. And then there was the same untested lunar module blasting off from the surface of the
[3:23:34.340 --> 3:23:40.820]  moon without the assistance of any ground crew and ascended 69 miles to attain lunar orbit.
[3:23:40.820 --> 3:23:45.460]  Then there was the ever reliable lunar module finding, catching and docking with another ship
[3:23:45.460 --> 3:23:50.980]  while in lunar orbit utilizing yet more untested technology. Then there was the command module
[3:23:50.980 --> 3:23:59.300]  shutting the lunar module and then commencing the 239,000 miles home. And we did it with a combination
[3:23:59.300 --> 3:24:04.820]  of lethal space radiation, lethal temperatures, a complete lack of breathable air and lower
[3:24:04.820 --> 3:24:11.700]  gravitational attraction that produces serious health problems and is not compatible with human
[3:24:11.700 --> 3:24:17.540]  existence. And then we did not have the rocket technology to power such a mission or the navigation
[3:24:17.540 --> 3:24:22.900]  system to guide a journey or the digital computer technology to control the navigation system,
[3:24:22.900 --> 3:24:28.500]  nor did we have the spacesuit technology to protect the astronauts. Did I mention they were
[3:24:28.500 --> 3:24:37.140]  unpressurized? Okay. So major or I should say project manager Thomas Kelly concurred noting
[3:24:37.140 --> 3:24:42.580]  that and he was project manager for Apollo 11. The skin, the aluminum alloy skin of the crew
[3:24:42.580 --> 3:24:48.500]  compartment was about 12 1000th of an inch thick. That's equivalent to three layers of Reynolds
[3:24:48.500 --> 3:24:53.540]  wrap that you could use in the kitchen. That was what was protecting our astronauts on the
[3:24:53.540 --> 3:25:00.180]  way to the moon and back. And Apollo 11 computer engineer Jack Garmin said the computer screens
[3:25:00.180 --> 3:25:04.580]  that we looked at at mission control. Well, they weren't exactly computer screens at all. They were
[3:25:04.580 --> 3:25:10.420]  televisions, all the letters, the characters, they were actually hand drawn. I don't necessarily mean
[3:25:10.420 --> 3:25:15.140]  with a brush, he said, but I mean that they were painted on a slide, but they sure looked impressive.
[3:25:16.180 --> 3:25:23.220]  Every one of those consoles on the floor of that of that just it was absolutely ridiculous because
[3:25:23.220 --> 3:25:27.940]  it really wasn't doing what everybody thought it was doing. It just looked super good. So essentially
[3:25:27.940 --> 3:25:32.980]  says Dave McGowan, essentially an oversized Jiffy Pop container with the brain power of a digital
[3:25:32.980 --> 3:25:40.820]  watch. And it went off without a hitch and returned without a hitch. Never have launched from an
[3:25:40.820 --> 3:25:47.060]  extra terrestrial location before. And we broadcast it at live on TV and nailed it because we did
[3:25:47.060 --> 3:25:52.900]  it right on Sunday night at nine o'clock when everyone could be glued to the TV at just the
[3:25:52.900 --> 3:26:00.500]  right moment. The odds. Oh, and every single bit of evidence and tape and documents about the moon
[3:26:00.500 --> 3:26:11.460]  landing were actually lost, not 100 cartons, not 50 cartons, all 700 cartons. Okay. Gee, you know,
[3:26:11.460 --> 3:26:17.220]  I think, you know, we're actually really good at preserving things. We preserve Judy Garland's shoes
[3:26:17.220 --> 3:26:23.220]  from Wizard of Oz, but we don't preserve a single carton of evidence that we actually went to the
[3:26:23.220 --> 3:26:29.620]  moon gone forever, right? Not a shred of documentation. But because of nostalgia and emotion, we're
[3:26:29.620 --> 3:26:35.060]  never allowed to talk about this or you're a Looney Tune. I don't know. I just can't ignore the fact
[3:26:35.060 --> 3:26:40.820]  that looking back in the 60s, we were able to do all of this yet can't pull it off in the year 2022.
[3:26:41.540 --> 3:26:46.660]  In 2009, all they had to do was crash something into the surface of the moon so they could get
[3:26:46.660 --> 3:26:51.860]  some test studies to see if there were water in the craters, and they couldn't even do that. Guess
[3:26:51.860 --> 3:27:00.180]  what? The photo footage. Something went wrong, some sort of mishap, and yes, in the year 2009,
[3:27:00.180 --> 3:27:06.580]  and we couldn't even get that, it was supposed to broadcast live. But we broadcasted live in a time
[3:27:06.580 --> 3:27:12.980]  with rabbit ears. Rabbit ears and no computers. When it took an entire room to house one single
[3:27:12.980 --> 3:27:22.500]  computer, we sent them up in a little tiny tin can. Okay. So was the entire thing about beating
[3:27:22.500 --> 3:27:30.660]  Russia? Well, yes. But why? Was Russia actually even that close to going to space? Were they as
[3:27:30.660 --> 3:27:36.500]  close as we thought they were? Or did we fabricate that to find a reason to why we had to be
[3:27:36.500 --> 3:27:43.140]  challenged, right, and then come out of winter? We needed a win at that point, desperately. Was
[3:27:43.140 --> 3:27:50.340]  the Cold War a cover for giving Russia technology? Did they have about the same technology we did?
[3:27:50.340 --> 3:27:57.220]  It wasn't much. And were we really having a Cold War with Russia? Or were they just the named
[3:27:57.220 --> 3:28:03.540]  enemy at the time? Hmm. And if they were a mortal enemy, why did we sign a treaty with them for
[3:28:03.540 --> 3:28:08.660]  for the Antarctica, right in the middle of the Cold War? Seems a little strange, right,
[3:28:08.660 --> 3:28:15.380]  that right smack in the middle of that 12 nations got together. And we agreed on a treaty
[3:28:16.100 --> 3:28:21.860]  for a continent that no one will be able to go and visit. It seems kind of strange. I thought
[3:28:21.860 --> 3:28:27.380]  they were our enemy. Hmm. And Russia and the US have the only bio weapons labs that house
[3:28:27.380 --> 3:28:32.340]  smallpox, interestingly enough. We share a lot of things, but I'm going to come right back and talk
[3:28:32.340 --> 3:28:37.620]  a little bit more about that. Because there's I think a lot more to the Russia narrative and
[3:28:37.620 --> 3:28:42.980]  Russia's story than we realize. But I've got a lot on this. So we'll come back. But we really
[3:28:42.980 --> 3:28:48.820]  need to think in concrete terms about what we're told every single day by the media. Well,
[3:28:48.820 --> 3:28:53.380]  I mean the government. I mean the media. I mean the government. Be right back. Kate Daly, your guest
[3:28:53.380 --> 3:29:01.380]  host. The eugenicist over 100 years ago were very public about their plans. They financed
[3:29:01.380 --> 3:29:07.380]  major universities. They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of
[3:29:07.380 --> 3:29:13.300]  New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be
[3:29:13.300 --> 3:29:19.220]  ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[3:29:19.220 --> 3:29:24.020]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing. And I was
[3:29:24.020 --> 3:29:28.500]  just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter, my wife
[3:29:28.500 --> 3:29:32.900]  makes dinner a lot of times. But I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast. And literally
[3:29:32.900 --> 3:29:38.580]  it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit
[3:29:38.580 --> 3:29:44.580]  down together and have the communal event. And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding
[3:29:44.580 --> 3:29:50.500]  is our normal biological actions and coming together. They really are sick, evil, scientific
[3:29:50.500 --> 3:29:55.780]  cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[3:29:55.780 --> 3:30:00.580]  Mike in California, thanks for calling. I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this
[3:30:00.580 --> 3:30:05.940]  gain of function research. Now, if you read the actual, you know, 2014 legislation, the U.S.
[3:30:05.940 --> 3:30:11.860]  government gain of function, deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of
[3:30:11.860 --> 3:30:17.460]  function research involving influenza, MERS and SARS viruses does nothing about SARS like viruses.
[3:30:17.460 --> 3:30:22.340]  And it's a research funding pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition. It's when you come to a
[3:30:22.340 --> 3:30:26.740]  four-way intersection, there's the stop sign. You stop, you look both ways and then you proceed.
[3:30:26.740 --> 3:30:31.300]  And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function,
[3:30:31.300 --> 3:30:36.180]  but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research. So,
[3:30:36.180 --> 3:30:39.780]  you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right. They don't quite know what they're
[3:30:39.780 --> 3:30:43.220]  talking about calling it gain of function. You know, that's why he didn't purge her himself.
[3:30:43.220 --> 3:30:47.620]  That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that
[3:30:47.620 --> 3:30:52.580]  mimic what the viruses do. But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function. They're making
[3:30:52.580 --> 3:31:18.420]  something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike. We love you.
[3:31:18.420 --> 3:31:24.260]  You can get the high levels of butane, nitrates, and antioxidants you want to help support a healthy
[3:31:24.260 --> 3:31:33.460]  liver, athletic performance, blood vessels, and more. Don't overlook the power of feed routes.
[3:31:33.460 --> 3:31:41.220]  Get your naturally occurring potassium, folate, vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K, and more.
[3:31:41.220 --> 3:31:49.460]  With one of nature's greatest treasures in VasoBeat from InfoWar's life today.
[3:32:11.220 --> 3:32:16.340]  Build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of
[3:32:16.340 --> 3:32:21.140]  millions of dollars. And now, with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day,
[3:32:21.140 --> 3:32:26.740]  we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their
[3:32:26.740 --> 3:32:32.660]  content free of charge. And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[3:32:33.380 --> 3:32:38.260]  InfoWar's and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[3:32:38.260 --> 3:32:44.500]  movement worldwide. But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[3:32:44.500 --> 3:32:48.820]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. So the biggest sale in InfoWar's history is going
[3:32:48.820 --> 3:32:53.700]  right now, the mega-emergency blowout sale, up to 75% off, getting incredible products,
[3:32:53.700 --> 3:32:55.620]  and keep InfoWar as strong as ever.
[3:32:55.620 --> 3:33:06.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:11.460 --> 3:33:15.380]  Welcome back. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host on the Alex Jones show today.
[3:33:15.380 --> 3:33:20.820]  And just kind of going back and maybe connecting some dots with Russia, with us right now,
[3:33:20.820 --> 3:33:28.500]  because Russia seems to be the big boogeyman. But was the Cold War a cover for giving Russia
[3:33:28.500 --> 3:33:34.900]  technology? I'll explain that in just a moment, because there is some evidence that that's exactly
[3:33:34.900 --> 3:33:42.020]  what we were doing. And why did we go and sign a treaty in the Antarctica with Russia? If Russia
[3:33:42.020 --> 3:33:46.980]  was our mortal enemy right smack during the Cold War, it just doesn't really make sense, does it?
[3:33:46.980 --> 3:33:53.220]  You kind of have to ask yourself these questions. And so why does... Well, let me put it this way.
[3:33:54.020 --> 3:34:00.340]  Was Russia told to play a part in taking Ukraine back? Is that why they aren't using the firepower
[3:34:00.340 --> 3:34:05.060]  on their own people of Ukraine? I mean, it could be that they don't want to kill their own people
[3:34:05.060 --> 3:34:10.260]  in Ukraine. And that's why the media is really struggling with the body count, because there
[3:34:10.260 --> 3:34:15.460]  isn't a severe body count. They would love for there to be a severe body count. But none of
[3:34:15.460 --> 3:34:19.940]  the stories are really shaking true. None of the things that the media is reporting about the whole
[3:34:19.940 --> 3:34:26.580]  Ukraine situation is really coming to be true, okay? When they say they kill in a hospital,
[3:34:27.380 --> 3:34:31.700]  3,000 babies are in a hospital. Have you ever seen a hospital with 3,000 babies?
[3:34:33.940 --> 3:34:39.940]  Yeah. Anyway, but I think there's so much more to that story that's not being told. But isn't
[3:34:39.940 --> 3:34:45.940]  it also very, very interesting that King Frautalot announced this week that Russia was going to
[3:34:45.940 --> 3:34:54.820]  implement a cyber attack on us? Uh-oh. I mean, why us? If you think about it, why would they be
[3:34:54.820 --> 3:35:01.940]  attacking us? Because the whole narrative so far has been Biden, King Frautalot, saying that
[3:35:01.940 --> 3:35:07.780]  we're not involved over there. We don't have bio weapons labs. We're not really even involved.
[3:35:07.780 --> 3:35:14.660]  We're just watching, okay? We didn't coup them in 2014. Of course not. So then why would Russia
[3:35:14.660 --> 3:35:19.780]  want to implement a cyber attack on us? Aren't they at war with Ukraine? It doesn't make sense.
[3:35:19.780 --> 3:35:25.300]  Their narratives are crashing into each other at the intersection of Bolshez Street and Krakow Krap
[3:35:25.300 --> 3:35:30.340]  Avenue is really what's going on here. And I hope the American people are seeing it and asking all
[3:35:30.340 --> 3:35:35.860]  the right questions. They keep telling us they didn't coup Ukraine, but oddly enough, Russia
[3:35:35.860 --> 3:35:41.460]  wants to cyberattack us. It doesn't make sense. But yet his intel tells him that this is what's
[3:35:41.460 --> 3:35:46.020]  going to happen. So they're busy making plans. No, the only thing they're planning to do is to
[3:35:46.020 --> 3:35:52.980]  set off a false flag and blame Russia, okay? And Russia did not have a seat at the table like they
[3:35:52.980 --> 3:35:57.460]  usually do. Think about that. China and Russia usually always have a seat at the table for
[3:35:57.460 --> 3:36:01.860]  everything, but they didn't have a seat at the table for the banking failure drill that happened
[3:36:01.860 --> 3:36:08.180]  four months ago. So was that to foment the crazy blame game for shortages and high prices? Of
[3:36:08.180 --> 3:36:12.420]  course it was. And then bring us into digital currency with the bank failure that's coming.
[3:36:12.420 --> 3:36:17.300]  The same digital currency that through the executive order that King Fraud a lot signed,
[3:36:17.300 --> 3:36:23.780]  okay? And so what if we played up the Russian space program to invent a race between the
[3:36:23.780 --> 3:36:27.460]  countries? Let's go back to the space program for a moment and let's go back into a little
[3:36:27.460 --> 3:36:34.020]  bit of history courtesy of Mr. Fagan. One branch of the Rothschild's family had financed Napoleon.
[3:36:34.020 --> 3:36:39.220]  The other branch of the Rothschild's family financed Britain, Germany and the other nations
[3:36:39.220 --> 3:36:44.100]  in the Napoleonic Wars. And immediately after the Napoleonic Wars, the Illuminati,
[3:36:44.660 --> 3:36:49.860]  you know that entity that liberals think only existed for a couple of years way back when in
[3:36:49.860 --> 3:36:55.140]  history, assumed that all the nations were so destitute and so weary of wars that they'd be
[3:36:55.140 --> 3:37:00.420]  so glad for any solution. So the Rothschild's Stooges set up what they called the Congress in
[3:37:00.420 --> 3:37:05.300]  Vienna. And at that meeting, they tried to create the first League of Nations, but their first
[3:37:05.300 --> 3:37:10.740]  attempted world war, world government, one world government on the theory that all crowned heads
[3:37:10.740 --> 3:37:15.780]  of European governments were so deeply in debt to them that they would willingly or unwillingly
[3:37:15.780 --> 3:37:21.700]  serve as their Stooges. So the Tsar of Russia caught this plot and completely torpedoed it.
[3:37:21.700 --> 3:37:27.220]  And of course, Nathan Rothschild's very angry then the head of the dynasty vowed that someday he
[3:37:27.220 --> 3:37:31.460]  and his descendants would destroy the Tsar and his entire family and his descendants
[3:37:31.460 --> 3:37:39.060]  did accomplish that in 1917. But a lot has happened since 1917, especially with Russia
[3:37:39.060 --> 3:37:45.860]  and especially with technology. While Karl Marx was writing the Communist Manifesto,
[3:37:45.860 --> 3:37:50.500]  and this is again Fagan, under the direction of the one group of Illuminati, right?
[3:37:50.500 --> 3:37:56.660]  Professor Karl Ritter of Frankfurt University was writing the antithesis under the direction
[3:37:56.660 --> 3:38:03.460]  of another group. And the idea was that who directs the overall conspiracy, if you will,
[3:38:03.460 --> 3:38:08.980]  all of these well-laid plants could use the differences in the two so-called ideologies
[3:38:08.980 --> 3:38:14.180]  to enable them to divide larger and larger numbers of the human race into opposing camps,
[3:38:14.180 --> 3:38:18.100]  so they could be armed and then brainwashed into fighting and destroying each other.
[3:38:18.100 --> 3:38:26.020]  I think that's what's happening now. Hmm. And destroy all political and religious institutions.
[3:38:26.020 --> 3:38:32.340]  What would they like to do? That's right. Go into a one-world religion and of course,
[3:38:32.340 --> 3:38:37.620]  a new world order. By the way, King Frautalot talked about that new world order this week
[3:38:37.620 --> 3:38:42.580]  and said, yeah, that new world order that's coming, we need to get everybody on board for that.
[3:38:42.580 --> 3:38:48.820]  But I thought that was a conspiracy. Oh, just, you know, all the presidents have said it,
[3:38:49.460 --> 3:38:57.140]  must be a conspiracy. Okay, so they absolutely sat down to write and to think out and to
[3:38:58.900 --> 3:39:05.140]  really implement communism, because then communism would be used as a weapon of war,
[3:39:05.140 --> 3:39:10.340]  right, and a weapon of fear. And not to say communism was good, obviously it wasn't,
[3:39:10.340 --> 3:39:18.100]  but they actually implemented and vented what it was and how it would be utilized to then have
[3:39:18.100 --> 3:39:22.820]  this sort of blame game, fear game going on, where we would always have an enemy,
[3:39:22.820 --> 3:39:28.740]  we would always have something that we needed to beat or needed to go to war with, right?
[3:39:28.740 --> 3:39:32.580]  Isn't that how it works? So according to John Rappaport, I love my friend John,
[3:39:32.580 --> 3:39:36.820]  because he always puts out some of the greatest stuff. And he talked about in 1927,
[3:39:36.820 --> 3:39:43.620]  Standard Oil of New York Rockefeller, built a refinery in Russia, huh, thereby helping the
[3:39:43.620 --> 3:39:49.700]  Bolsheviks put their economy back on their feet, right? So Professor Anthony Sutton said this was
[3:39:49.700 --> 3:39:54.660]  the first United States investment in Russia since the revolution. Shortly thereafter,
[3:39:54.660 --> 3:40:01.300]  Standard Oil of New York and its subsidiary, Vacuum Oil, concluded a deal to market Soviet
[3:40:01.300 --> 3:40:06.740]  oil in European countries, and it was reported that the loan of $75 million to the Bolsheviks
[3:40:06.740 --> 3:40:15.220]  was arranged. So wherever Standard Oil would go, Chase National Bank was sure to follow. Love Chase.
[3:40:15.220 --> 3:40:21.220]  The Rockefeller's Chase Bank was later merged with the Warburgs Manhattan Bank to form the present
[3:40:21.220 --> 3:40:27.780]  Chase Manhattan Bank. And in order to rescue the Bolsheviks, we were supposedly an archenemy of
[3:40:27.780 --> 3:40:32.980]  the Chase National Bank was instrumental in establishing the American Russian Chamber of
[3:40:32.980 --> 3:40:39.220]  Commerce in 1922. The Rockefeller's Chase National Bank was also involved in selling
[3:40:39.220 --> 3:40:46.180]  Bolshevik bonds in the United States in 1928. And the Soviet government had been given United
[3:40:46.180 --> 3:40:51.860]  States Treasury funds by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks, of course,
[3:40:51.860 --> 3:40:59.060]  again, acting through Chase Bank. But the Rockefellers apparently were not alone in
[3:40:59.060 --> 3:41:07.060]  financing the communist arm of this conspiracy. And a conspiracy is a well-laid plan. Boy,
[3:41:07.060 --> 3:41:11.540]  they have a lot of them. According to Professor Sutton, there's a report in the State Department
[3:41:11.540 --> 3:41:17.700]  file that names Kuhn Loeb and Company, the long-established important financial house in New
[3:41:17.700 --> 3:41:23.700]  York, as the financier of the Russian's first five-year plan. And you can see the U.S. State
[3:41:23.700 --> 3:41:30.500]  Department decimal file on that. Why would the Rockefellers and Armand Hammer and others take
[3:41:30.500 --> 3:41:38.100]  the lead in such a covert transfer program over the course of decades? Well, money and profits
[3:41:38.100 --> 3:41:43.460]  on one level, isn't that always how it works? And on another level, bolstering the Russian,
[3:41:43.460 --> 3:41:52.340]  communist, socialist state was part of their plan, the Rockefeller plan, to expand socialism in many
[3:41:52.340 --> 3:41:59.700]  forms all across the countries all over the world. It's always funny to me that people can
[3:42:00.740 --> 3:42:08.580]  read the Bible, read the book of revelations, especially Christians, and then try to mock
[3:42:08.580 --> 3:42:15.220]  conspiracy theorists for saying, this is the direction we're going in. How do we get from here
[3:42:15.220 --> 3:42:22.100]  to there? How do we get from here to there without all of that taking place? Do they think
[3:42:22.100 --> 3:42:28.260]  it takes place in a day? You know, it's so funny to me that we can't recognize that major conspiracies
[3:42:28.260 --> 3:42:35.380]  and plans have been laid and set since the dawn of time. And especially as Christians out there
[3:42:35.380 --> 3:42:41.380]  should realize that we should be the ones that really get it. But isn't it odd and funny that
[3:42:41.380 --> 3:42:49.140]  you actually get the mocking a lot from Christians? And so, do they believe the book or not? It's
[3:42:49.140 --> 3:42:52.980]  always a question. Anyway, I'll be right back. I'm Kay Daly, your guest host.
[3:43:19.300 --> 3:43:25.780]  Send the quote, fallen or sinful state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we
[3:43:25.780 --> 3:43:31.540]  try to bring into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering us. They're only making us
[3:43:31.540 --> 3:43:37.140]  for the press. In the end, they're only making us less filled. It is only by going within and
[3:43:37.140 --> 3:43:41.140]  really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves. That's why the
[3:43:41.140 --> 3:43:46.580]  globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[3:43:46.580 --> 3:43:52.260]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the
[3:43:52.260 --> 3:43:56.100]  third dimension. And that's where the incredible products come in at infostore.com.

[3:45:10.500 --> 3:45:16.820]  the supply chains have broken down, and infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll
[3:45:16.820 --> 3:45:21.940]  and paying for operations. And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist

[3:45:27.140 --> 3:45:31.940]  people than ever despite the censorship. But because of cost increasing and having to run

[3:46:58.500 --> 3:47:04.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:04.500 --> 3:47:17.940]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from KateDallyRadio.com.
[3:47:18.580 --> 3:47:24.660]  You know, tying all of this together, it's kind of interesting, isn't it? When you look at some
[3:47:24.660 --> 3:47:33.220]  really well-laid plans to involve Russia in many, many plans and types of funding and banks and
[3:47:33.220 --> 3:47:39.700]  everything else that we were doing all along during the supposed Cold War as well. But I
[3:47:39.700 --> 3:47:46.020]  thought a Cold War meant we were at war, really, right? Yeah, not so much. Anyway, why would the
[3:47:46.020 --> 3:47:52.820]  Rockefellers, Armand Haber and others take the lead in this covert transfer program over the
[3:47:52.820 --> 3:47:59.460]  course of the decades? You've got money, you've got profits, okay? It says John Rappaport, but on
[3:47:59.460 --> 3:48:05.620]  another level, bolstering the Russian communist social estate was really what they were all, well,
[3:48:05.620 --> 3:48:10.820]  that's what they were after. You've got to have the enemy. It doesn't mean the enemy doesn't exist.
[3:48:10.820 --> 3:48:17.540]  It means that you create the enemy, you conjure up the enemy, and the enemy does what the enemy
[3:48:17.540 --> 3:48:23.060]  does, but we wanted to use that enemy. That's really kind of like a weapon of war. So we're
[3:48:23.060 --> 3:48:28.580]  supplying Russia with all of this vital technology that it lacked, and that eventually produced the
[3:48:28.580 --> 3:48:34.340]  Cold War. And that mighty standoff really was this gigantic moneymaker for the banksters,
[3:48:34.340 --> 3:48:38.260]  and it also created a threat to Europe, which justified the rise of
[3:48:40.340 --> 3:48:47.060]  European Union. Yeah. See, they would love to regionalize all of us. They'd love for us in North
[3:48:47.060 --> 3:48:54.340]  America, Canada, and Mexico to be a region too. They'd like to have six, basically six regions
[3:48:54.340 --> 3:49:01.060]  instead of the sovereignty of nations. So the European Union, that really gave rise at that
[3:49:01.060 --> 3:49:07.780]  point was more of the causation or the catalyst for the European Union to come about. So the
[3:49:07.780 --> 3:49:13.300]  individual states, countries, would then lose their sovereignty to the decision maker called the
[3:49:13.300 --> 3:49:19.780]  European Union. It's kind of like a little test run for one world order. And another major Rockefeller
[3:49:19.780 --> 3:49:26.100]  CFR Bilderberg plan was to extend this covert agenda into the socialism, globalism, and the
[3:49:26.100 --> 3:49:32.740]  EU is the regional face of globalism. This is why it's so loved. They love it. And in Korea,
[3:49:32.740 --> 3:49:38.420]  we have direct killing of Americans, right? With Soviet weapons. And the American casualty rule
[3:49:38.420 --> 3:49:47.140]  in the Korean War was 33,000 killed, 103,000 wounded, and 130,000 man North Korean Army,
[3:49:47.140 --> 3:49:52.340]  which crossed the South Korean border in June of 1950, was trained, supported, and equipped by
[3:49:53.060 --> 3:49:59.940]  Soviet Union, and included a brigade of Soviet T-34, sorry, medium tanks
[3:50:02.260 --> 3:50:08.820]  with US Christie suspensions. The artillery tractors were direct metric copies of the
[3:50:08.820 --> 3:50:14.020]  caterpillar tractors that we have here. The trucks came from Henry Ford Gorky plant or the
[3:50:14.020 --> 3:50:22.180]  ZIL plant. The North Korean Air Force had 183 Yak plants built in plants with US land lease equipment.
[3:50:23.940 --> 3:50:29.540]  Seems cozy. Does it not? I just get the cozies when I'm reading this. The Yaks were later replaced
[3:50:29.540 --> 3:50:37.300]  by MIG-15s powered by the Russian copies of the Rolls Royce jet engines sold to the Soviet Union
[3:50:37.300 --> 3:50:44.100]  in 1947. Who were the government officials responsible for this transfer of known military
[3:50:44.100 --> 3:50:50.020]  technology? The concept originally came from National Security Advisor, who's 200 years old,
[3:50:50.020 --> 3:50:55.140]  Henry Kissinger, still alive, still kicking, still with us. Isn't that interesting? Anyway,
[3:50:55.140 --> 3:51:02.500]  who reportedly sold President Nixon on the idea that giving military technology to the Soviets
[3:51:02.500 --> 3:51:11.220]  would temper their global territorial ambitions? And not least that Henry had been paid a paid
[3:51:11.220 --> 3:51:17.220]  family employee of the Rockefeller since 1958, and has served as the International Advisory
[3:51:17.220 --> 3:51:23.460]  Committee Chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, a Rockefeller concern, our biggest liaison to China,
[3:51:23.460 --> 3:51:27.460]  and also every single president that's ever run for office needs to get his permission.
[3:51:27.460 --> 3:51:33.460]  That's fun. Anyway, the Armin Hammer and Occidental Petroleum would supply the Soviets
[3:51:33.460 --> 3:51:39.700]  with massive plants that can quickly be converted to explosive manufacturing. Well,
[3:51:39.700 --> 3:51:44.580]  that's no surprise. And Soviet tractor plants were established in the early 30s with major
[3:51:44.580 --> 3:51:50.580]  US technical and equipment assistance. The Stalingrad tractor plant was completely built
[3:51:50.580 --> 3:51:56.020]  in the United States, shipped to Stalingrad, and then installed in prefabricated steel buildings
[3:51:56.020 --> 3:52:00.260]  also purchased in the United States. So sure, let's have a Cold War with Russia.
[3:52:01.060 --> 3:52:06.340]  Then elite US corporations and financiers can supply Russia with the updated weapons under
[3:52:06.340 --> 3:52:10.900]  the table and create an even bigger enemy and bigger race wars and everything else.
[3:52:10.900 --> 3:52:17.860]  And when I say race wars, I meant the space war. It was the space war with Russia that got everybody
[3:52:17.860 --> 3:52:24.820]  enticed and very, very eager to do something that was, well, virtually impossible. Still is,
[3:52:24.820 --> 3:52:33.780]  apparently, because we don't go back ever. Alrighty. Anyway, I just want to thank COVID
[3:52:33.780 --> 3:52:43.300]  because the good news, people, is that COVID stopped any war action for two solid years,
[3:52:43.300 --> 3:52:52.260]  no war, virtually no war, and no school shootings. Not a lot was going on because everybody was
[3:52:52.260 --> 3:52:58.260]  respectful of COVID. You would think that if a nation was really an enemy of another nation,
[3:52:58.260 --> 3:53:02.100]  that would be the time you would strike, right? Wouldn't you think they were at the weakest point
[3:53:02.100 --> 3:53:08.980]  at that point? Nope, no, because the same people that planned out COVID were planning everything
[3:53:08.980 --> 3:53:13.780]  else. And so I always think it's really interesting because you get really no intersection with
[3:53:14.900 --> 3:53:21.060]  plans very often because you don't want to bump one for another one. I mean, when one's going so
[3:53:21.060 --> 3:53:28.100]  well, you want to keep it going, of course. Why not? You want to get the full money's worth,
[3:53:28.100 --> 3:53:33.860]  right, out of COVID. So nothing else really was going on during COVID when, well, I would think
[3:53:33.860 --> 3:53:39.300]  most people would think that's exactly when it should have been. Well, whatever. People are
[3:53:39.300 --> 3:53:43.620]  figuring out they've been lied to for over 100 years. And I think that's really the most important
[3:53:43.620 --> 3:53:48.500]  thing. And on a side note, it's interesting because we get a lot of people now that are
[3:53:48.500 --> 3:53:53.700]  following the false flags and actually looking at all the clues and understanding what's going on.
[3:53:53.700 --> 3:53:58.180]  So there's some good news for you is that people, if you look at the comments sections,
[3:53:58.180 --> 3:54:03.940]  you'll realize on every article, how many people are not buying their BS, which I absolutely love.
[3:54:03.940 --> 3:54:09.460]  So the elites are suddenly coming down with COVID right now that I thought COVID was,
[3:54:09.460 --> 3:54:19.060]  you know, the seasonal cold. Well, I don't know. So my false of flag, false of flag alerts are going
[3:54:19.060 --> 3:54:26.020]  off when you see Obama, you see red at the White House, Hillary and, and, you know, some of the
[3:54:26.020 --> 3:54:33.300]  others, I would say, all coming down with COVID all of a sudden. Why is that? Is King Fraudalot
[3:54:33.300 --> 3:54:38.980]  next? Hmm, certainly strange. I'll tell you that much. And they won't let King Fraudalot out of
[3:54:38.980 --> 3:54:43.460]  the movie studio next to the White House very often. In fact, when was the last time he actually
[3:54:43.460 --> 3:54:50.340]  had people visit him in the White House? I'd say never. And, you know, we had a lot of visitations
[3:54:50.340 --> 3:54:57.460]  with Trump as president, but hmm, suddenly no one wants to go or I would pretty much think that's
[3:54:57.460 --> 3:55:03.700]  the answer. Or all of a sudden, there's just no invitations to be had. Hmm. Okay. Never meets with
[3:55:03.700 --> 3:55:10.100]  anyone, never invites anyone. And now he's off to Europe. I don't know about you, but I kind of gave
[3:55:10.100 --> 3:55:17.860]  a deadline of them blaming either a patriot or a their own narrative like COVID, taking him out
[3:55:17.860 --> 3:55:23.540]  by the end of this year so they could replace them with Hormala, which more horrific, less
[3:55:23.540 --> 3:55:28.260]  horrific, they're both puppets. Let's face it. So does it even matter? I mean, does it even matter,
[3:55:28.260 --> 3:55:35.540]  really? Somebody pulls the strings and they talk. Or in Hormala's case, she just repeats the words
[3:55:35.540 --> 3:55:41.940]  passage of time, passage of time, passage of time, things like that, like word of the day.
[3:55:42.980 --> 3:55:49.220]  So we get these two total losers that basically cued our nation and implemented themselves
[3:55:49.220 --> 3:55:55.940]  into these two seats. But they are absolutely 100% directed by very, very well laid plans.
[3:55:55.940 --> 3:56:01.940]  Let's not forget. And, you know, I'll have to say, I have to say in all the years of research
[3:56:01.940 --> 3:56:06.900]  that I've done and in 10 years of intense research, and I'm talking intense research,
[3:56:07.780 --> 3:56:12.740]  I started out a little bit of a neocon 10 years ago. And I just kind of figured, well, whatever
[3:56:12.740 --> 3:56:17.540]  we did was always the right thing, as most Americans do, right? We don't question a lot.
[3:56:18.180 --> 3:56:23.780]  And it wasn't until I took the deep dives down into the real information and all the evidence
[3:56:23.780 --> 3:56:29.860]  supporting it by their own documentation and their own words that I finally realized what was
[3:56:29.860 --> 3:56:34.020]  going on in this country. And you don't want to know something kind of fascinating is everybody
[3:56:34.020 --> 3:56:42.660]  that seems to do that is usually led to the same answers. Hmm. Not different amounts of information.
[3:56:42.660 --> 3:56:48.900]  I'm talking the same information, the same players, the same people, and the same plans,
[3:56:48.900 --> 3:56:55.460]  well laid plans. The next time somebody calls you a conspiracy theorist, I mean, I don't know what to
[3:56:55.460 --> 3:57:01.300]  do, laugh, cry at the stupidity of that remark. But yes, well laid plans have always been here,
[3:57:01.300 --> 3:57:05.860]  they'll always be here, and they're not going away. And the only thing that we can do and the
[3:57:05.860 --> 3:57:10.420]  only thing they're afraid of is the populace figuring it out and exposing it. It's really
[3:57:10.420 --> 3:57:15.220]  the only thing that can stop it. And so if we can do that as a populace, if we can work really
[3:57:15.220 --> 3:57:20.580]  hard to get people to see the actual evidence, that's, hey, that's the only way that we could
[3:57:20.580 --> 3:57:26.340]  actually make a dent in what's about to happen. And I hope we do. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host
[3:57:26.340 --> 3:57:31.860]  from the Kate Daly show. I do a live show every day. And thankful to be on the Alex Jones show.
[3:57:31.860 --> 3:57:37.220]  And of course, you know, everyone called Alex a conspiracy theorist for years really seems to be
[3:57:37.220 --> 3:57:46.180]  right. All these plans, they're coming true, aren't they? Thanks you guys.
[3:58:07.380 --> 3:58:12.740]  Bad nightmare. You're in a car. I can get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because
[3:58:13.940 --> 3:58:19.860]  you are totally dizzy and confused. You have a concussion. And that's what the globalists have
[3:58:19.860 --> 3:58:25.380]  done. They have stunned us. They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[3:58:25.380 --> 3:58:29.300]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave him speech, he called the great new narrative,
[3:58:29.300 --> 3:58:34.820]  where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to make
[3:58:34.820 --> 3:58:39.300]  sure that people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[3:58:39.300 --> 3:59:05.300]  That's what the great reset is. They need darkness to thrive. The light lives at in at full wars.com.
[3:59:09.940 --> 3:59:18.980]  15 days to flatten the can. I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop
[3:59:18.980 --> 3:59:27.940]  at mega corporations. That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy leaving
[3:59:27.940 --> 3:59:36.820]  companies that only I own profitable. You will then be my slaves. Oh, and then you get that
[3:59:36.820 --> 3:59:43.460]  special shot of freedom from copra will remove your immune system. So you'll be dependent on me
[3:59:43.460 --> 3:59:52.660]  for the rest of your miserable lives. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[3:59:52.660 --> 4:00:07.540]  It's Alex Jones.
