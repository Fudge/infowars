[00:00.000 --> 00:24.280]  Forty-two days until the most historic election in world history, nationalism versus globalism
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.280]  up for referendum.
[00:25.280 --> 00:30.720]  You know the Democrats are already fighting dirty, and now, Trump Derangement Syndrome
[00:30.720 --> 00:34.880]  has gone into thermonuclear meltdown.
[00:34.880 --> 00:40.600]  Its Chernobyl and Fukushima and Three Mile Island all rolled into one.
[00:40.600 --> 00:46.280]  They've got prominent Democrats, prominent groups on Twitter saying murder Mike Pence,
[00:46.280 --> 00:53.600]  murder Trump, murder Ted Cruz, murder ICE, murder police, murder, murder, murder, murder,
[00:53.600 --> 00:54.600]  murder.
[00:54.600 --> 01:02.480]  Burn, death, kill, headline, dims, pursuing, quote, destruction of America.
[01:02.480 --> 01:05.040]  To stop Kavanaugh, those are the announcements.
[01:05.040 --> 01:07.480]  That's the story up on NewsWars.com.
[01:07.480 --> 01:14.160]  It is getting absolutely insane as we watch the death rows of these criminals and the
[01:14.160 --> 01:19.880]  minions that their entire ideology is the reflected glory of believing that they have
[01:19.880 --> 01:26.200]  captured and shackled the will of the West and that it is their slave and that they will
[01:26.200 --> 01:33.800]  absorb it, they will eat it, and somehow then become greater men than those they had conquered.
[01:33.800 --> 01:39.920]  But great men do not seek power, they only rise up once things become incredibly dark
[01:39.920 --> 01:44.360]  and there's no more denial that the time for resistance is here.
[01:44.360 --> 01:50.160]  Those of us being persecuted by the globalist are extremely honored because it means we
[01:50.160 --> 01:52.440]  are over the target.
[01:52.440 --> 02:00.240]  It is September 25th, 2018 on this global Tuesday worldwide transmission and you are
[02:00.240 --> 02:06.280]  in the war like everybody else just as important as I am, Matt Drudge or President Trump with
[02:06.280 --> 02:10.720]  your leadership at point blank lanes, going against the bullying, going against the peer
[02:10.720 --> 02:15.320]  pressure, going against the social conditioning and telling the truth and driving through
[02:15.320 --> 02:22.280]  the enemy line for touchdown after touchdown as we begin to demoralize the enemy not by
[02:22.280 --> 02:25.640]  suppressing them but by winning.
[02:25.640 --> 02:29.400]  Their will is now being fully broken.
[02:29.400 --> 02:35.240]  The death rows we witness now are the true shine that humanity is about to be coming
[02:35.240 --> 02:36.240]  back up.
[02:36.240 --> 02:45.440]  All right, does that mean we're offering some type of utopia, no.
[02:45.440 --> 02:50.760]  What it does mean is that the dystopia of the globalist where they want to demoralize
[02:50.760 --> 02:55.320]  us and dominate us and control us, no.
[02:55.320 --> 03:00.360]  Our will to fight is back and we are strong and we are persecuted because we're telling
[03:00.360 --> 03:01.360]  the truth.
[03:01.360 --> 03:07.080]  This is DrudgeReport.com, at least 10 minutes ago, the two top stories on DrudgeReport.com
[03:07.080 --> 03:15.600]  are these incredible reports, video Ted Cruz and his wife hounded from restaurant by angry
[03:15.600 --> 03:16.680]  leftist mob.
[03:16.680 --> 03:23.600]  That was the first article this morning by Steve Watson, Paul's capable but also reclusive
[03:23.600 --> 03:24.600]  brother.
[03:24.600 --> 03:25.600]  Just as capable as Paul.
[03:25.600 --> 03:27.520]  I wish we could get Steve back on air.
[03:27.520 --> 03:33.520]  Here of group that harassed Ted Cruz tweeted about dead cops assassinating Mike Pence.
[03:33.520 --> 03:36.920]  He's also known as snake man or pencil neck.
[03:36.920 --> 03:41.040]  He's a professor that leads the terrorist organization.
[03:41.040 --> 03:43.720]  Leftist group that harassed Ted Cruz vows, you are not safe.
[03:43.720 --> 03:49.000]  We will find you and then it gets worse.
[03:49.000 --> 03:56.160]  The leftist group again calls for the resistance, the rising up and killing Mike Pence, everyone
[03:56.160 --> 04:04.080]  else, top resistance member admits he gets paid by higher ups to show the division.
[04:04.080 --> 04:10.120]  Of course, what is in the WikiLeaks?
[04:10.120 --> 04:11.240]  What's in their own documents?
[04:11.240 --> 04:18.800]  There's top professors and psychological warfare telling Hillary three months out, we're losing
[04:18.800 --> 04:20.080]  the public's attention.
[04:20.080 --> 04:21.880]  They don't believe us.
[04:21.880 --> 04:26.760]  We need to expand culture war.
[04:26.760 --> 04:30.320]  We need to expand cultural division.
[04:30.320 --> 04:35.520]  What is that old against young, black against white, white against black, vice versa, male
[04:35.520 --> 04:42.440]  against female, female against male, north against south, just mindless idiocy.
[04:42.440 --> 04:47.360]  We should be unified by liberty and freedom and true justice and a free market that is
[04:47.360 --> 04:56.280]  our path to Valhalla, Nirvana and heaven all rolled into one.
[04:56.280 --> 05:00.760]  Stay with us, critical transmission straight ahead.
[05:00.760 --> 05:05.920]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[05:05.920 --> 05:10.040]  Info awards is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives,
[05:10.040 --> 05:13.840]  the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[05:13.840 --> 05:17.680]  People say, why would you start a fight with them because they were already dominating
[05:17.680 --> 05:22.000]  and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.120]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this
[05:27.120 --> 05:32.320]  is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if
[05:32.320 --> 05:38.320]  you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com,
[05:38.320 --> 05:43.240]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[05:43.240 --> 05:47.880]  We have huge sales at infowarsstore.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[05:47.880 --> 05:51.360]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[05:51.360 --> 05:53.320]  and you're right to the market.
[05:53.320 --> 05:57.000]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the global Spain win.
[05:57.000 --> 06:23.000]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour, with your support, I'm counting on you.
[06:23.000 --> 06:39.880]  Welcome to the Archive.
[06:39.880 --> 06:41.880]  Believes that we are their dinner
[06:41.960 --> 06:47.400]  But many others are breaking the trance and humanity's soul is rising
[06:47.560 --> 06:52.040]  Thanks to God. Thanks to all your actions and thanks to all of your prayers
[06:52.440 --> 06:57.560]  It is September 25th 2018 on this Tuesday worldwide broadcast
[06:57.720 --> 07:01.520]  Paul Joseph Watson is joining us coming up with huge news
[07:01.520 --> 07:06.680]  He's also hosting the fourth hour and then I've cleared the decks to take phone calls throughout the day
[07:06.680 --> 07:11.320]  Trump derangement syndrome has gone into its final meltdown
[07:12.160 --> 07:18.320]  They are frothing and calling for death and violence everywhere. They are bullying. They are intimidating
[07:18.440 --> 07:23.680]  They are trying to be alphas and and make us submit to them
[07:24.960 --> 07:29.520]  They are fully intending to steal the 2018 election
[07:29.520 --> 07:34.120]  There will be a massive red wave, but they have built a seawall of
[07:34.120 --> 07:39.160]  Of election fraud and people voting in the names of dead people and so much more
[07:40.040 --> 07:42.040]  I'm not saying that you as a
[07:42.760 --> 07:48.080]  Conservative or as a Christian should look at people who've recently died on the death rolls and then if you're in
[07:48.720 --> 07:52.840]  Cities or states that don't have voter ID laws run by Democrats to go vote
[07:53.040 --> 07:57.760]  Because those systems are already going to be fraudulent anyways no matter what you don't want to lower yourself to their area
[07:57.880 --> 08:00.360]  You want to go knock on a hundred doors yourself?
[08:00.360 --> 08:06.560]  You want to call to talk radio yourself? You want to call to C-SPAN yourself? You want to go speak at the city council yourself?
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.120]  You want to get involved and stand up against this mafia operation?
[08:11.120 --> 08:13.600]  And that's how we're going to win and in the cyber war
[08:14.080 --> 08:18.520]  Against the globalist and those that would keep our country suppressed under chai-com control
[08:19.160 --> 08:21.760]  You intensify your operations
[08:22.400 --> 08:26.160]  Spreading articles spreading video spreading links. You're going to get demonized. You're going to get attacked
[08:26.160 --> 08:30.320]  They're going to hit you with Pavlovian conditioning. They're going to even ban you. It doesn't matter
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  Again most folks I know that are
[08:34.560 --> 08:40.760]  So-called in the Liberty movement or the Patriot movement who are prominent have kind of backed off under the censorship and have
[08:41.280 --> 08:43.040]  self-censored themselves
[08:43.040 --> 08:45.760]  Hoping that they can just keep those platforms because it's all they have
[08:46.320 --> 08:48.680]  We're going to lose everything and people have those attitudes
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.920]  But the good news is the general public isn't acting like that, but I've seen a crap ton of cowardice out there
[08:54.920 --> 08:58.680]  I've not seen it by Gavin McGinnis. I've not seen it by Steven Crowder
[08:59.000 --> 09:05.480]  I've not seen it by people like Anthony Comey and many many others, but we have all seen really
[09:06.400 --> 09:08.560]  saddening levels of people not just
[09:09.120 --> 09:11.840]  Not standing up for free speech now and keeping their heads down
[09:11.840 --> 09:17.320]  But also virtue signaling against info wars during all this is saying oh Jones had it coming to him
[09:18.040 --> 09:20.200]  That's what the globalist are betting on and when you do that
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.600]  Facebook and Twitter and YouTube are going to push you and they're going to make it prominent
[09:24.600 --> 09:30.560]  See part of silencing me on these platforms is that then they can go out and try it out the lie on a post
[09:31.800 --> 09:34.320]  Like Facebook promotes and is in a partnership
[09:35.120 --> 09:39.760]  With the video producers at snapchat and they put out every week huge lies about me
[09:41.080 --> 09:43.080]  About Sandy Hook about
[09:43.960 --> 09:45.960]  Now I'm harassing people
[09:45.960 --> 09:51.740]  How I went up to a poor Hispanic Native American ladies for no reason and called him Brown
[09:51.760 --> 09:57.840]  Cook what's clan and they edit the video and edit out ten instances where they call me a monkey four times
[09:58.200 --> 10:00.200]  They say my mother's married to her brother
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.480]  They she calls me you know a subhuman white person that I should go back to Europe and a pilgrim
[10:06.480 --> 10:08.760]  So I said my goodness you're brown KKK
[10:09.320 --> 10:15.280]  Well instead that cuts her going I'm a veteran and the me saying brown KKK and then playing sad music
[10:15.280 --> 10:18.880]  that's the criminal fraud of
[10:19.800 --> 10:21.800]  the fake news engines
[10:22.120 --> 10:29.700]  Then the New York Times of Washington Post Facebook all of them just opening up on me with just hellish demonization
[10:30.440 --> 10:35.280]  People say well you should have submitted to them. I'm trying to change the world. I'm in a war
[10:35.760 --> 10:39.780]  Do you think George Washington was trying to win popularity contest in British newspapers?
[10:39.780 --> 10:47.140]  They were saying George Washington was a rapist and George Washington was a murderer and George Washington was a thief
[10:47.140 --> 10:50.660]  And George Washington was a wimp and George Washington was gonna lose
[10:50.660 --> 10:57.340]  But when he ended up defeating the British Empire that nobody else had defeated and then when he refused to be king
[10:58.420 --> 11:00.420]  They tried to make him king
[11:00.460 --> 11:06.540]  Others wouldn't stand for that to quote. Thank God for the renegades need to play that today Steve Boss. What a great guy and
[11:06.540 --> 11:12.020]  When he refused to be king the king of England had a proclamation and said today
[11:13.260 --> 11:17.620]  George Washington is the greatest man alive on earth and
[11:18.700 --> 11:20.860]  When George Washington died in the UK
[11:22.180 --> 11:28.220]  They had their flags at half mass and respected him because they all knew it was all crap was all lies
[11:28.220 --> 11:34.020]  And he persevered through it and that goes back to the Teddy Roosevelt clip the Teddy Roosevelt quote
[11:34.020 --> 11:36.580]  Maybe you guys can put it on screen because I can't get it perfectly right, but
[11:37.500 --> 11:42.900]  It isn't about the skeptic. It isn't about the critic who just sits there with their thumb in the rear end
[11:44.060 --> 11:49.340]  Attacking and lying about greater men that actually get in the arena. It's about those that are in the arena and those that know
[11:50.140 --> 11:54.780]  The hard-won battles and even the battles you lose you win because you took action
[11:54.780 --> 12:00.420]  You stood for something and so thank God will never be with the timid people who sit up there in the peanut gallery
[12:00.420 --> 12:03.780]  And and and point out the strong have stumbled
[12:04.660 --> 12:12.140]  It's not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or the doer of deeds could have done them better
[12:12.420 --> 12:19.740]  Credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs
[12:19.980 --> 12:21.980]  Who comes up short again and again and again?
[12:21.980 --> 12:29.740]  Because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deeds
[12:30.020 --> 12:36.980]  Who knows the great enthusiasm so do I know them and the great devotion so do I know them and it spins himself in a worthy cause
[12:36.980 --> 12:43.740]  What a worthy cause free market America Christian values not being captured by globalist and technocrats and radical Islam
[12:44.100 --> 12:49.860]  who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and
[12:49.860 --> 12:58.380]  Who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place
[12:59.780 --> 13:05.260]  She'll never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat
[13:06.260 --> 13:14.380]  True words never spoken. That's my credo. I've never been more alive. I've never felt better. I've never been stronger
[13:14.380 --> 13:20.620]  I've never been more on fire. I am so fulfilled. I can't even handle it and
[13:21.740 --> 13:23.740]  You know how the enemy gets me though?
[13:24.300 --> 13:30.740]  When I see Hillary and how devoted to evil and narcissism and mental illness and corruption and sorrows and all the minions and
[13:30.820 --> 13:33.140]  Everyone fighting for her because she was supposed to be the queen
[13:34.180 --> 13:38.020]  To run us further into the ground and to see them in this sick cult
[13:38.020 --> 13:44.700]  To voting themselves to a fraud and our evil husband and all the wars and all the corruption and stealing the Haitian money
[13:45.100 --> 13:55.620]  The fact that their idol is so obviously fallen and twisted and pathetic and the antithesis of goodness and the antithesis of courage and the opposite of everything good
[13:57.980 --> 14:04.220]  When I see the howling left driving by always like cowards in their cars going F you Jones go to hell
[14:04.220 --> 14:09.100]  Where is your family because you know, they try to take my kids away and they still say I don't have my kids. It isn't true
[14:10.820 --> 14:12.260]  And
[14:12.260 --> 14:17.500]  I think about how low they are and when the left sees me with my family my great-looking kids and my great-wife
[14:18.140 --> 14:20.940]  They walk over they go F your family right to our face
[14:22.620 --> 14:30.860]  Because they hate family and they hate strength and they hate will and it doesn't get to me that they're trying to make me feel alone
[14:30.860 --> 14:37.420]  Or bad or that I feel like I'm surrounded because I'm not for every person that attacks me 50 people wave at me or shake my hand
[14:37.420 --> 14:43.540]  Literally even place like Austin. It's that they're so twisted. They're so fallen. They're so gone
[14:44.340 --> 14:48.380]  Then all I want for them is to have the same thing. We've had an open free society
[14:48.940 --> 14:53.060]  The opposite of what Soros is building. That's why he calls it open society
[14:53.980 --> 14:56.100]  He means you're open for him to rape you
[14:56.900 --> 14:58.900]  financially
[14:58.900 --> 15:03.540]  He wants Europe's borders totally open the Dalai Lama says it's an Islamic invasion. It should be stopped
[15:04.580 --> 15:06.580]  Soros challenges, hungry laws
[15:07.500 --> 15:09.500]  European rights court
[15:12.380 --> 15:18.720]  Think about that because he's been trying to overthrow their government. He's had his evil butt thrown out of there
[15:20.540 --> 15:26.660]  So I take it as a complete honor that one of the most monstrous men alive on earth hates my guts
[15:26.660 --> 15:32.740]  And it's set out to destroy me because that means I'm right over the target like a heat-seeking missile
[15:33.020 --> 15:39.780]  I'm honing in he's looking for me. I'm looking for him and then the information war when we collide it will be
[15:40.700 --> 15:42.700]  oblivion for him and
[15:42.740 --> 15:44.580]  Valhalla for me
[15:44.580 --> 15:49.700]  Yes, the Valkyrie smile on info wars not on that worm
[15:50.260 --> 15:54.740]  That's an enemy of humanity in progress and he is already fallen
[15:54.740 --> 15:57.380]  But soon he will fall into the pit
[15:59.340 --> 16:06.620]  Heart disease is on the rise clogged arteries high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you
[16:06.620 --> 16:14.300]  But the symptoms are there loss of energy blood sugar spikes and drops poor circulation and irregular heart beat are just a few of
[16:14.300 --> 16:17.060]  These that can alert you that something is wrong here
[16:17.060 --> 16:24.300]  How heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America my blood pressure has normalized
[16:24.300 --> 16:30.420]  My diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier

[20:51.540 --> 20:57.460]  Now here's the beginning of the video where they come over and start hounding them and again
[20:57.460 --> 21:03.020]  They say guilty until proven innocent guilty until proven innocent guilty until proven innocent as they're saying I believe them
[21:03.020 --> 21:10.260]  I believe like I believe just you you cannot question these democratic party operatives if a woman accuses you of something a thousand years ago

[21:59.900 --> 22:04.460]  There are now three people who have come forward and who have said
[22:04.460 --> 22:18.860]  Of course the left all they can do is chant the same mindless garbage over and over again now
[22:19.420 --> 22:21.420]  They try that's the first clip
[22:21.420 --> 22:24.700]  But out by these people the next clip is them hounding them out of the restaurant
[22:24.860 --> 22:31.540]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us. We'll get the second clip in a moment, but clearly Paul Trump arranges syndrome is going to high gear a
[22:31.540 --> 22:34.220]  B, I went up to
[22:35.300 --> 22:41.500]  Oliver Darcy of CNN who's been publicly getting us deplatformed. He's at a public place. He's a public figure in his job capacity
[22:41.500 --> 22:47.700]  I just simply said how dare you get me deplatformed. That's very Nazi like I was banned off Twitter for that
[22:47.820 --> 22:50.140]  So I can't talk to public figures in public
[22:50.140 --> 22:55.380]  But if you hound people and say by the way, you're not safe anywhere. That's coming up Twitter leaves you up
[22:55.380 --> 22:58.060]  Paul Joseph Watson of info wars calm. Thanks for joining us
[22:58.060 --> 23:06.580]  Well, this is the thing Alex, this is targeted harassment clearly when Trump pull out that executive order over the weekend promising executive action against big tech
[23:06.860 --> 23:15.060]  Business insider and they do this every single time all these mainstream media outlets always say there's no evidence that Twitter discriminates against conservatives
[23:15.300 --> 23:22.380]  Okay, so you were permanently banned from Twitter for essentially being rude to a CNN reporter. Okay, that happened
[23:22.380 --> 23:30.020]  They called it targeted harassment. I was suspended for 12 hours on Twitter for posting a video of what was a news event
[23:30.020 --> 23:37.740]  I wasn't even advocating it. I merely described what happened in the video you being mean to a CNN reporter boo-hoo this group
[23:38.260 --> 23:43.140]  Go and harass Ted Cruz and his wife and their private family time chase them out of the restaurant
[23:43.740 --> 23:48.900]  Post it on Twitter. They then post quote. You are not safe. We will find you
[23:48.900 --> 23:52.940]  We will take from you the piece you've taken from so many others. Okay, and let's be clear
[23:52.940 --> 23:58.460]  That's on the Twitter account where they uploaded the video. So this is them now adding work. We're stalking you in
[23:59.340 --> 24:04.500]  The same thread they openly dox Gavin McKinnis put out his phone number
[24:04.500 --> 24:11.180]  I spoke to Cassandra Fairbanks over at Gateway ponder Gavin McKinnis is getting death threats has been getting death threats all morning
[24:11.180 --> 24:19.380]  All afternoon his family's been getting death threats because this group put his phone number on the same thread that went viral on Twitter of them
[24:19.500 --> 24:27.420]  Engaging in targeted harassment against Ted Cruz and his wife of them engaging in targeted harassment against other politicians by saying we're gonna find you
[24:27.420 --> 24:33.260]  We're gonna get you and doxing Gavin McKinnis three clear violations of Twitter's rules
[24:33.260 --> 24:39.660]  You were suspended for being rude to a CNN reporter. What is gonna happen to this account add to this Alex?
[24:39.660 --> 24:47.860]  The background of their Twitter account is the anti for flag and T for has been designated by the DHS and the FBI as a domestic terror
[24:48.100 --> 24:53.100]  Organization link in the info was article to the Politico article which explains that
[24:53.540 --> 24:57.900]  Okay, on top of this the founder of this group a guy called
[24:58.620 --> 25:00.420]  Isaacson professor
[25:00.420 --> 25:04.100]  Mike Isaacson who we've spoken about before mr. Pezneck himself
[25:04.100 --> 25:11.460]  He has tweets that are still active on Twitter where he literally encourages people to assassinate Mike Pence
[25:11.620 --> 25:16.180]  This is the founder of this group that harassed Ted Cruz and his wife last night
[25:16.180 --> 25:19.300]  He has tweets saying we should kill white people. He has tweets
[25:19.980 --> 25:23.940]  Celebrating the deaths of police officers. This is all still on Twitter
[25:24.020 --> 25:31.580]  He's not been suspended. None of the tweets have been removed James Woods got locked out of his Twitter account for posting a satirical
[25:31.580 --> 25:35.780]  Meme this guy encourages the assassination of the vice president
[25:35.780 --> 25:41.460]  He's the founder of this group that harassed Ted Cruz last night still on Twitter. No action whatsoever
[25:41.460 --> 25:47.060]  So give me a break when they claim. Oh, there's no evidence of discrimination against conservatives
[25:47.060 --> 25:51.140]  Yes, there is every single frigging day and this is another example of that
[25:51.740 --> 25:56.700]  Let's talk about snake man. He for years. He's been saying kill cops kill everybody. He's a professor
[25:56.700 --> 26:02.900]  I mean, I think people need to go peacefully confront this guy and the the school. They're in New York because snake man
[26:03.180 --> 26:07.780]  Really is in my view organizing domestic terrorism. I mean just randomly kill cops
[26:09.300 --> 26:15.620]  Well, I've embedded his tweets. He said my jobs program kill all white people born before 1962
[26:15.620 --> 26:19.340]  They made him remove that one. They didn't make him remove this one quote
[26:19.820 --> 26:22.900]  Reminder that if Trump does end up winning this stupid thing bearing mind
[26:22.900 --> 26:28.700]  This is an election day reminder that if Trump this is a quote quote reminder that if Trump does end up winning this stupid thing
[26:28.700 --> 26:33.260]  To assassinate Mike Pence first that tweet is still active on Twitter
[26:33.260 --> 26:38.460]  He was not forced to delete it like James Woods. He was not locked out of it his account for that tweet
[26:38.620 --> 26:41.200]  He's got like weird poetry Alex where he
[26:42.140 --> 26:43.100]  fantasizes
[26:43.100 --> 26:50.700]  About Donald Trump hanging by his toes. He literally tweeted on June 16th last year quote kill cops first
[26:50.700 --> 26:56.500]  He tweeted off the pigs one day after the murder of five police officers in Dallas
[26:56.500 --> 27:02.820]  And let me add this I have to make a major correction. His real name is not snake man. I forgot. I think you dubbed him chicken neck
[27:02.820 --> 27:05.020]  I mean, he is the literal human chicken
[27:05.460 --> 27:07.960]  Continuum has neck. Yes, Pesnak
[27:08.580 --> 27:11.140]  Yes, and he embraced that insult. He loves it
[27:11.140 --> 27:20.500]  He also tweeted on May 12 2017 quote kill your local politicians before you kill they kill you that a tweet is still active on Twitter
[27:20.500 --> 27:25.260]  Didn't get forced meanwhile Twitter claimed that I said use battle rifles on the media, which was not true
[27:26.260 --> 27:30.500]  Yeah, and you're banned forever. Oh, but there's no there's no double standard Alex
[27:30.500 --> 27:36.820]  There's no discrimination against conservatives complete and utter BS time and time again. These tweets are still active
[27:36.820 --> 27:42.740]  They've been up for almost 12 hours at this point Gavin McKinnis his phone is blowing up with death threats
[27:42.980 --> 27:49.180]  You know wakey-wakey Jack. What time is it in San Francisco right now? No action whatsoever. Oh, Dorsey
[27:49.540 --> 27:53.220]  They all love it. They love it. In fact, I know we know the inside baseball
[27:53.220 --> 27:55.900]  He wanted to get rid of me the whole time as soon as I got in Rubio's face
[27:55.900 --> 27:59.220]  He said oh now the Republicans will support getting rid of Alex
[27:59.220 --> 28:04.580]  He wanted to do it the whole time. He was just dangling it out there like he was hanging me over an alligator pit
[28:04.580 --> 28:06.580]  Oh
[28:06.700 --> 28:12.580]  Precisely, and then you've got the other story which is this Krasenstein fellow who's being caught on tape admitting that
[28:13.140 --> 28:15.100]  Hierups pay him for his tweets
[28:15.100 --> 28:18.100]  He always tweets at Donald Trump and appears towards the top of Trump's
[28:18.500 --> 28:24.620]  Twitter thread to quote so the division so CNN constantly bangs on about Trump sowing division in America
[28:24.620 --> 28:29.780]  He you've got a top member of the resistance admitting that he's paid by hierups to do exactly that

[32:58.940 --> 33:15.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:15.460 --> 33:25.780]  You know, I love Lyndon's voice, but
[33:27.460 --> 33:29.460]  Raquel Graves is a
[33:30.620 --> 33:34.180]  Great talent of his own listen to this since high school
[33:34.180 --> 33:43.260]  I want to hear you scream. Oh, I love this song
[33:47.260 --> 33:50.820]  Seriously, that's fun to drive through the hill country
[33:53.140 --> 33:55.300]  The big full moon's rising up behind the hills
[33:55.300 --> 34:02.820]  Of course the kids aren't the car with you and you press down that accelerator
[34:05.100 --> 34:07.100]  Well, guess what
[34:07.500 --> 34:12.700]  He of course after Glenn Danzig left the Misfits was the lead singer for a long time with hundreds of great songs
[34:12.700 --> 34:16.500]  And he was one of the headliners at a major festival in England
[34:17.060 --> 34:19.580]  But the left cancelled him
[34:19.580 --> 34:29.260]  Because well, he tweeted Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson and this just illustrates how they're waging war on people's free speech
[34:31.220 --> 34:40.860]  It is the Chinese social score system where you can't travel you can't have bank accounts anything and then they also always build straw man that we're Nazis, you know when they
[34:40.860 --> 34:50.380]  Docs gab McGinnis and gave out his cell phone number. So he's getting all these death threats. He's joining us next segment
[34:50.740 --> 34:57.420]  When they doxed him with the very same group that just confronted and threatened Ted Cruz and his wife and said we're gonna get you
[34:57.420 --> 34:59.420]  We know where you are when they did that
[35:00.500 --> 35:02.500]  They also said oh and tell
[35:03.180 --> 35:05.180]  Gab McGinnis you love white genocide
[35:05.980 --> 35:09.060]  Because that's a trigger word for the left because they're pushing white genocide
[35:09.060 --> 35:12.580]  All these professors are saying when you get rid of the white race. It's inherently evil
[35:13.180 --> 35:16.380]  That's what Tucker Carlson pointed out last night was
[35:16.860 --> 35:21.140]  They're saying of a woman says that you sexually assaulted her you are guilty
[35:21.140 --> 35:28.060]  You're not innocent until proven guilty under Western jurisprudence. You are guilty and that piece is coming up in a moment as well
[35:28.060 --> 35:31.980]  But it's just amazing if you're white you're guilty if you're a man you're guilty
[35:33.540 --> 35:36.700]  This is authoritarianism and you've got that different Democrat
[35:36.700 --> 35:41.820]  Congresswomen saying if you're a man sit down and shut up. You're inherently bad
[35:42.820 --> 35:48.940]  How freak a zoid is all this but oh of your women that Bill Clinton settled lawsuits with for rape
[35:49.500 --> 35:54.220]  Or your Hillary Clinton that was famous for representing child molesters what she chose to do out of college and
[35:54.580 --> 36:01.020]  Bragg that she knew they were guilty of raping little girls until their services were smashed out. That's okay
[36:02.020 --> 36:05.520]  Or if you want to fund radical jihad taking over that's okay as well, but
[36:05.520 --> 36:07.520]  We're gonna get
[36:08.720 --> 36:12.560]  Mr. Graves on the broadcast, but here's Paul Joseph Watson's piece on it
[36:15.080 --> 36:20.440]  Yet another example of Communist China's social credit score arriving in the West
[36:20.760 --> 36:29.320]  Mikhail Graves former vocalist of the iconic punk band the Misfits had his sold-out shows at next month's up and downtown music festival in Edmonton
[36:29.320 --> 36:37.920]  Cancelled why did he commit a grave crime? Is he the latest victim of the Me Too movement? Did he fall terribly ill?
[36:38.320 --> 36:44.680]  No, he retweeted Paul Joseph Watson. That's right Graves's shows were cancelled because he retweeted yours truly
[36:45.120 --> 36:47.120]  info wars bright bar and
[36:47.600 --> 36:52.080]  Defended oh wait for it. Wait for it. He defended free speech
[36:52.520 --> 36:58.360]  The festival's artistic director the guy who cancelled him Brent Oliver said this
[36:58.360 --> 37:02.800]  It's the support of Alex Jones if you go in through his tweets and replies
[37:02.800 --> 37:06.720]  He's tweeting at Hillary Clinton calling her a criminal
[37:06.760 --> 37:12.440]  He's retweeting some British right-wing dude that I don't even want to know his name. That's me
[37:12.640 --> 37:14.160]  It's all again
[37:14.160 --> 37:18.880]  It's it's it's so close to the son of guys like Richard Spencer president
[37:18.880 --> 37:22.800]  The white nationalist think tank national policy institute that I just don't feel
[37:22.800 --> 37:29.640]  You're comfortable with it. I should also be clear Oliver says this is not about politics. Oh, yeah, right
[37:29.640 --> 37:33.880]  I understand conservative politics, but this is not conservative politics to me
[37:33.880 --> 37:37.520]  This is alt-right hate and that was the feeling of the board and country to our policy
[37:37.520 --> 37:42.360]  So we removed him but wait neither I or Alex Jones are all right
[37:42.360 --> 37:47.760]  I make videos attacking the alt-right. So yes, it is about politics and yes
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.960]  You cancelled his gigs because he's a conservative and you're an intolerant moron
[37:52.960 --> 37:55.240]  This is what Mikhail Graves the singer said
[37:55.240 --> 37:59.800]  I'm in the game of raising people up and giving them a victorious attitude and telling them
[37:59.800 --> 38:05.640]  It's okay to be you and to be strong and to believe in themselves and the people around them. I want to lift people up
[38:05.640 --> 38:10.240]  I'm not looking to tear people down sounds pretty hateful to me
[38:10.320 --> 38:17.000]  So once again, we see conservatives being socially and financially punished because of their political beliefs
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.760]  Because god forbid should any celebrity stray out of line and be allowed to hold diverse opinions
[38:23.760 --> 38:25.560]  No, they must be punished
[38:25.560 --> 38:32.320]  You know a similar thing happened to the American tennis player tennis sandgren who was also subjected to a media
[38:32.920 --> 38:39.600]  Inquisition merely for following some right-wingers on Twitter that shall not attempt to deviate from our mono culture
[38:39.600 --> 38:44.760]  That shall not be allowed to express independent thought because we're so tolerant
[38:44.760 --> 38:46.880]  So progressive listen
[38:46.880 --> 38:51.600]  I've lost count of the amount of people who tell me either in person or online both
[38:52.040 --> 38:59.800]  Celebrities and non-celebrities in journalism in Hollywood in sports in business how they're all terrified of letting slip their
[39:00.120 --> 39:05.000]  Conservative political beliefs because they know they'd be hounded out of their careers
[39:05.120 --> 39:11.320]  This is the de facto communist Chinese social credit score being implemented in the West
[39:11.320 --> 39:18.640]  Conservatives libertarians being socially ostracised financially sabotaged and having their careers jeopardized
[39:19.080 --> 39:27.200]  Simply for daring to think for themselves being refused financial services being refused bank accounts for engaging in
[39:27.320 --> 39:29.640]  Hate what constitutes hate?
[39:30.440 --> 39:35.440]  Anything that challenges far-left progressive dogma. This is where we're at
[39:35.440 --> 39:41.560]  This is the culmination of contrived moral panic and frenzied political hysteria
[39:41.560 --> 39:44.360]  If you want to support the Misfits vocalist Mikhail Graves
[39:44.360 --> 39:50.120]  He's playing an alternate venue in Edmonton one that actually supports diversity of thought God forbid
[39:50.680 --> 39:55.920]  Details are in the description. Oh, and if you didn't know this is my second channel that you watch
[39:57.320 --> 40:01.640]  All right, so there you go. That's part of Paul Watson's report. So the former lead singer of the Misfits
[40:01.640 --> 40:07.600]  banned from a major music festival for retweeting Alex Jones and Paul Watson because we're all Nazis
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.400]  Even though anybody that knows knows Nazis don't like us because they want to own the right wing
[40:12.400 --> 40:18.800]  No, Liberty owns the right wing. So get that through your stinking heads. I hate black races white races all you idiots
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.640]  But it doesn't mean I'll kiss your butt if you're a brown racist trying to get in my face
[40:23.640 --> 40:25.640]  I'll tell you I think you're a piece of crap and
[40:25.640 --> 40:31.120]  It's brown racist that a bunch of white controllers and university professors are pushing
[40:31.880 --> 40:36.280]  Now I didn't make a deal out of this because I don't want to change my phone number
[40:36.280 --> 40:41.880]  But my wife has now demanded it because she sits there in real time while it's ringing with women going
[40:41.880 --> 40:47.360]  Oh, baby, you got me pregnant. Oh, oh, baby. Let's meet again tonight. Oh or the death threats
[40:47.360 --> 40:51.440]  I got doxxed three days ago. I've had hundreds of threatening phone calls
[40:51.440 --> 40:58.360]  Hundreds of calls that they're gonna come after me fake women calling up saying, oh, you know, you had sex with me in DC
[40:58.360 --> 41:03.640]  Baby, you know, meet me here. I mean, it's they're trying to create some nexus point
[41:03.640 --> 41:05.440]  I think to make fake
[41:05.440 --> 41:08.160]  Claims or something. So I got doxxed. I
[41:09.240 --> 41:13.600]  Guess three four days ago they and you know, it's mainstream news reporters have done it
[41:13.600 --> 41:15.880]  They gave out my number how to get rid of my last number a year ago
[41:16.640 --> 41:20.440]  So it's a nightmare to let everybody's numbers back in there and then let everybody know your new number
[41:20.440 --> 41:24.000]  But yes, I got doxxed too. So I'm just gonna go ahead and announce it because I've got to get a new phone
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.600]  In fact, I have to go down there. I guess today I get a new number
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.600]  It's just a total hassle
[41:28.600 --> 41:35.000]  But that's the Trump derangement syndrome and the crazy town that they've gone into and that shows they're being directed
[41:35.000 --> 41:42.480]  The Gavin and I both got doxxed at the same time basically that the same group that's saying run by this New York professor saying kill everybody
[41:43.240 --> 41:45.720]  And he's saying kill the president kill Pence
[41:45.720 --> 41:51.080]  He's not getting in trouble and then you have top resistance member admits he gets paid by higher ups to sow the division
[41:51.080 --> 41:54.400]  We have Gavin McGinnis right now. We're gonna go to break
[41:55.240 --> 42:00.320]  And come back and talk to him now people are like, well, you better back down. You're getting persecuted. No, we're over the target
[42:00.320 --> 42:03.880]  We're winning my god. Our forebears had to fight and die to create this country
[42:03.880 --> 42:07.640]  I feel kind of like a wimp that I just have to be demonized and doxxed and
[42:08.280 --> 42:10.280]  denied banking services and
[42:10.840 --> 42:14.160]  Unperson on the internet, but remember that's the precursor to real tyranny

[42:59.040 --> 43:03.240]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now

[43:10.320 --> 43:14.560]  And the entire Soros crime syndicate people say why would you start a fight with them?
[43:14.960 --> 43:20.640]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground, and I knew we had no future. We didn't do this
[43:20.960 --> 43:22.960]  So we've already had incredible success
[43:23.240 --> 43:30.640]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target
[43:30.640 --> 43:36.240]  And if you financially support us that if you spread the word about our articles and videos info wars calm

[45:06.680 --> 45:10.880]  Oh, we want more money more money and oh this and that and so I've broken my contract

[47:05.360 --> 47:20.800]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[47:27.120 --> 47:33.160]  Trump derangement syndrome has gone into meltdown 42 days out from the historic election
[47:33.160 --> 47:41.000]  When I went to the free Alex Jones rally that they had this weekend when I got out of the car
[47:41.720 --> 47:43.720]  Leftists were driving by going f you
[47:44.160 --> 47:47.920]  They actually came but they wouldn't get out of their cars. They would just drive around and say f you were gonna get you
[47:48.440 --> 47:53.360]  They're throwing coffee on everybody. They're attacking people. What's the same in Europe if you're a nationalist
[47:53.360 --> 47:56.160]  It's white people attacking you saying you're a racist
[47:56.160 --> 48:04.000]  Leftist group that harassed Ted Cruz vows. You're not safe. We will find you the founder known as chicken neck of
[48:04.160 --> 48:10.600]  The group is a professor that harassed Ted Cruz tweeted about dead cops assassinating Mike Pence and then coming up top
[48:10.680 --> 48:18.160]  Resistance leader the Twitter top pins under every Trump tweet admits he gets paid to show the division
[48:19.120 --> 48:24.160]  Yeah, McGinnis just got doxed. I got doxed three and a half days ago and
[48:24.160 --> 48:29.040]  I'm getting calls like you're a piece of filth. You're a racist
[48:29.640 --> 48:31.640]  Hope you die
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.200]  They all said fake women calling up, you know saying oh, you know, it was great having sex with the NDC
[48:37.600 --> 48:38.840]  Let's hook up again
[48:38.840 --> 48:43.800]  So I think they're trying to shut up that next point hoping I'll talk to these women and they can say I raped them or something
[48:43.800 --> 48:46.240]  So that's what they're doing with the doxing Gavin
[48:46.240 --> 48:49.200]  What would you call of CRTV get off my line?
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.200]  You've been banned off Twitter. You're being deplatformed just like I am. We're in quite a club. Hey
[48:54.200 --> 48:58.200]  Why do you think they're getting so brazen and then arrogantly saying at Google?
[48:58.200 --> 49:02.880]  No one's being censored on the web who's conservative. It's like saying Hitler wasn't a Nazi or that, you know
[49:03.440 --> 49:08.280]  No, the sky isn't blue and then why do you think they're accelerating and it seems to be this particular?
[49:09.760 --> 49:12.440]  Group that's coordinating this particular
[49:13.680 --> 49:15.680]  Antifa group
[49:15.680 --> 49:23.040]  Well, I think we're living in a monarchy in a sense and Google and all these social media companies are the kings and the queens and
[49:23.320 --> 49:26.320]  Us peasants are starting to rise up
[49:26.320 --> 49:29.560]  So the king is decreed that we must be banished and taken down
[49:29.560 --> 49:34.800]  I don't know invent a salt tax invent a grass tax invent a social media tax
[49:34.800 --> 49:36.360]  We need to get rid of these peons
[49:36.360 --> 49:41.760]  They're becoming troublesome and you look at things like when Google was caught in that meeting saying, you know
[49:41.760 --> 49:46.600]  We hate Trump and we're gonna we're gonna change the way Americans think that that's the kings
[49:46.600 --> 49:49.160]  You're looking at the monarchy there having a meeting in the royal palace
[49:49.160 --> 49:54.560]  They they face no retribution for that because they're in control and I think right now
[49:54.920 --> 50:01.720]  We're slowly realizing that these kings and queens hold way more power than we thought they did
[50:01.720 --> 50:08.360]  And I just cannot get over the irony of you being attacked when the name of your company is info wars
[50:08.360 --> 50:13.360]  You've been saying there's a war on information for years and here you are being shut down
[50:13.360 --> 50:16.520]  I mean is anyone else seeing the madness of this and
[50:17.200 --> 50:21.560]  I even read in some of the Twitter and Facebook meetings that have come out even the New York Times goes
[50:21.760 --> 50:23.440]  We're in an information war
[50:23.440 --> 50:28.240]  We've got to stop these pro-trump people and Hillary says you've got to shut down all the fake news
[50:28.240 --> 50:33.120]  Or we're gonna lose the midterms and then they play dumb they define us as fake news as hate
[50:33.120 --> 50:38.080]  They wave a magic wand and then have the nerve to say they're not censoring us. It's unbelievable
[50:38.760 --> 50:42.960]  Well, you wouldn't believe some of these prank calls. I got I had no idea how radical they are
[50:42.960 --> 50:45.120]  I don't get any of the sexy ladies stuff
[50:45.280 --> 50:50.280]  But I do get I get a lot of like old-timey Russian speeches on five inch
[50:50.280 --> 50:55.880]  I thought the horse gear and then I get a old-timey message is going communism will win
[50:56.520 --> 51:00.400]  Capitalism will fail give up like real propaganda type stuff
[51:00.400 --> 51:03.720]  It sounds like it's on a bullhorn and then this is very telling
[51:03.720 --> 51:09.440]  I got these messages where the guy goes look at you you inbred piece of white trash white people are felt
[51:09.440 --> 51:13.320]  This is a white person saying it by the way, you know, you guys are a bunch of cave people
[51:13.560 --> 51:18.760]  The Egyptians had advanced ways to deal with their dead boy. You guys live with your dead and case
[51:18.760 --> 51:21.920]  He's saying you guys, but he's clearly white
[51:22.240 --> 51:26.680]  it's crazy and that the kind of hatred and eugenics and
[51:26.680 --> 51:31.760]  Progenicide these people are talking. It's literally what you hear from the KKK, but flipped it
[51:31.760 --> 51:33.400]  But I don't want to say we're on radio and TV
[51:33.400 --> 51:38.360]  But what you said off air repeat the family version of I'll how you white guys have little ding-dongs
[51:38.520 --> 51:44.280]  Us black guys got huge ones and it's white guys saying yeah, he said it's not our fault that your women love us
[51:44.280 --> 51:47.840]  It's not our fault that they want a phallus that exceeds three inches
[51:47.840 --> 51:52.720]  I'm using fans you're talking to him and it's clearly a white guy and and what I say to that is a
[51:52.720 --> 51:56.560]  I don't talk about white nationalism or white anything. I'm an ideas guy
[51:56.560 --> 52:00.880]  I care about the West and I love black conservatives who want to shut down the government, but B
[52:01.600 --> 52:05.280]  Isn't it bizarre that a white person is talking these black power tropes?
[52:05.280 --> 52:10.840]  I can imagine a black person talking about white supremacy. You'd put him in a mental institution exactly
[52:11.720 --> 52:14.280]  Well, you know why I thought of some insiders in DC
[52:14.360 --> 52:21.120]  Van Jones is still covertly in charge of that diversity office that Obama set up and it's actually the weirdest craziest
[52:21.120 --> 52:28.000]  Twisted communist black power crap from the 60s and 70s. That's what's being taught to all the young white professors
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  So that's why they're like saying all that
[52:30.400 --> 52:35.680]  Yeah, that white cave person thing you hear that in a lot of rap songs ice cube does it?
[52:35.680 --> 52:39.000]  It's a big sort of remember the lady at the New York Times the Asian lady
[52:39.000 --> 52:43.120]  She said you white people are subhuman goblins living and living in caves
[52:44.120 --> 52:49.680]  And I will give them that it is true that Egypt was more advanced with body disposal
[52:49.680 --> 52:52.480]  A quarter of a million years ago to say
[52:54.080 --> 52:57.840]  But but I mean I'm not even thinking in terms of what's better Africa or Europe
[52:57.840 --> 53:03.480]  I just want freedom and you're hearing the most racist craps who cares what the cave people did to their debt
[53:03.480 --> 53:07.560]  I don't care if they had sex with them, but you know what I started doing Alex
[53:07.560 --> 53:14.080]  I started answering the phone and talking to these people and of course you want to do a show where you keep that phone number
[53:14.080 --> 53:16.640]  And every day they can call in and you just talk to them. Oh my gosh
[53:16.640 --> 53:21.280]  I'm gonna keep my number and put it out public and we'll have a show that's not on radios
[53:21.280 --> 53:24.840]  It'll be filled with profanity and I'll just let them call up and death threat me. Oh, I
[53:25.520 --> 53:29.840]  Did and the first thing they do is they're starstruck and they can't believe it's real
[53:29.840 --> 53:34.240]  It's like they're talking to to Elton John or something and they start stuttering
[53:34.240 --> 53:36.400]  And then they would just yell f you and hang up
[53:36.560 --> 53:41.840]  But the the few that would talk for a second I'd say what is your issue here and they'd say white genocide is awesome
[53:41.840 --> 53:46.240]  I love white genocide and they go. All right. Why would I care? I don't talk outside of South Africa
[53:46.240 --> 53:49.280]  I don't really talk about white genocide. It's not on my top five
[53:49.840 --> 53:56.040]  Talking points and then they would want to be friends after and I realized and I I sent one of your producers
[53:56.040 --> 54:00.040]  The quintessential example of these prank callers Christian Chia Coolis
[54:00.040 --> 54:07.400]  I think his name is and they're just very pro-communist loser pothead millennials who want free stuff because work is hard
[54:07.400 --> 54:11.440]  And they need a thousand bucks to fix their car so they can get back on uber
[54:11.440 --> 54:19.560]  But you're right when I've been around the BuzzFeed riders and people they're almost half apologetic and admit their mercenaries and then they they think
[54:19.560 --> 54:22.160]  We're really cool because we're free. They get talking points
[54:22.160 --> 54:26.200]  But then they still have to go back and you know engage in all this and I noticed a few times
[54:26.200 --> 54:30.040]  It's Mike Cernovich said if you just pat him on the head and act like you like him
[54:30.040 --> 54:32.480]  They'll actually write halfway nice articles, but here's the deal
[54:32.480 --> 54:35.600]  I'm not gonna be fake and pat him on the head to get him to be nice to me
[54:35.600 --> 54:38.560]  And I'm not saying Cernovich is bad for doing that, but they are literally
[54:38.560 --> 54:43.920]  Arrested development and what is up with the weird soy boy face because I can't even make it. It's like this
[54:44.320 --> 54:47.640]  I mean, what is that thing they all do is like a sign of their weirdness?
[54:48.680 --> 54:52.320]  You know, I was talking to a Mercedes Carrera. She's an adult film star
[54:52.320 --> 54:59.040]  Who's remarkably astute when it comes to these sort of social patterns and her contention is and it sounds very Alex Jonesy
[54:59.040 --> 55:02.640]  That with birth control there's extra estrogen in the water and everything
[55:02.640 --> 55:08.400]  But it's also it changes the way we behave women who are on birth control behave in a way that's not the way we behave
[55:08.400 --> 55:10.400]  like they're in the first trimester of
[55:11.040 --> 55:14.480]  Pregnancy and those women they don't want an alpha male who's gonna have sex with them
[55:14.480 --> 55:18.680]  They want a sibling or someone who's gonna be warm and safe around them and not a threat
[55:18.680 --> 55:25.720]  And so I think these men start mimicking what these birth-controlled girls want and they want basically like a sibling
[55:25.720 --> 55:30.320]  So they become these sexless sort of hey guys, let's go to let's go to six
[55:32.280 --> 55:36.160]  I'm a drone. I'm your best pal. Let's be friends
[55:36.160 --> 55:41.120]  G ginger want to go for a stroll want to go have coffee
[55:42.280 --> 55:45.600]  Hi, imagine what woman would run I hi want to go out
[55:49.280 --> 55:52.800]  Sorry but being a punk anarchist kid in the 80s
[55:52.800 --> 55:57.560]  I remember we'd go to these workshops and we did there's some feminists with dreads named penny would be at the
[55:57.760 --> 55:59.760]  Anarchist bookstore talking about women's rights
[55:59.760 --> 56:03.680]  And I remember at the young age of 18 when she was done
[56:03.680 --> 56:07.120]  She'd walk out and some dude on a motorbike would show up with a leather vest
[56:07.120 --> 56:09.760]  We didn't give a crap about what she was talking about all day
[56:09.760 --> 56:11.600]  And she'd just hop on the back of his bike and
[56:12.480 --> 56:17.640]  Often in the sunset and I realized these women they may say they want allies, but they don't
[56:18.160 --> 56:24.120]  Currently want they only want power over young women to control them in the power of femininity and
[56:25.160 --> 56:30.240]  Exactly, I mean I know a lot of guys in politics as you do and they tell me the stories about these Democrat
[56:30.240 --> 56:37.040]  Consultant women who literally beg conservatives to treat them like pigs slap them around they love it
[56:37.040 --> 56:39.040]  They have a fetish for it. It's sick
[56:39.600 --> 56:42.960]  It is depraved and you can't wear a mega hat in New York. You can't go to a bar
[56:43.280 --> 56:47.120]  You also have to run from women because it's like being the Beatles
[56:47.600 --> 56:51.120]  Women are obsessed with guys in mega hats. It has to be late at night
[56:51.360 --> 56:52.560]  No one can see them
[56:52.560 --> 56:57.040]  But I talked to other proud boys who wear mega hats and they go it's insane
[56:57.040 --> 57:01.360]  The women maul me and I think it's because they don't like the mess they created
[57:01.520 --> 57:07.040]  They castrated an entire generation and then they go. Where's your balls and these kids go?
[57:07.040 --> 57:12.880]  Well, you took them. They're right there in your purse. Can I have them back? No, all right. You created a mess
[57:14.160 --> 57:17.440]  When we come back I want to play a few of these clips because we can joke about this all day
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.880]  Trump arrangement syndrome just keeps going up and up. I actually like two years ago
[57:21.280 --> 57:25.520]  When is peak insanity and I want to ask what's going to happen if they lose the midterms?
[57:25.520 --> 57:30.000]  Which unless there's successful election fraud, I think they're going to lose because people are predicting the
[57:30.480 --> 57:34.240]  This blue wave and all this. I don't agree with that. I mean, that's not what I'm seeing
[57:34.240 --> 57:40.080]  The trump effect is a lot of folks won't tell you in polls are going to vote trump gab mcginnis of cr tv get off my lawn
[57:40.240 --> 57:44.160]  I'm alex jones of info wars dot com the most banned broadcast in the world
[57:44.800 --> 57:47.920]  For a good reason. We love freedom and we are the antidote to tyranny
[57:50.160 --> 57:55.040]  Just like our information is game changing our products are game changing and survival still x2 is the pure
[57:55.040 --> 58:00.800]  Eye at eye. No one else has this from deep earth crystals between 7 to 12,000 feet. It's very hard for me to get
[58:01.040 --> 58:03.040]  It's the good halogen
[58:03.040 --> 58:09.920]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromine that literally fog you fill all your cells
[58:10.400 --> 58:15.840]  Your thyroid you name it mildry selenium goes with it like a horse and carriage selenium is an electrochemical
[58:17.040 --> 58:19.040]  It's needed as well in all
[58:19.200 --> 58:22.080]  activity in the body particularly uh neurons
[58:22.080 --> 58:27.440]  So these go incredibly well together. We have a combo of those just experience it for yourself
[58:27.520 --> 58:29.520]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[58:30.240 --> 58:32.240]  Very simple stuff filter your water
[58:32.880 --> 58:37.600]  Yeah, I find myself some water filters best out there for the price when I say it's the last run
[58:38.640 --> 58:41.120]  I think it'll be six months a year till we get more. I hope we get more
[58:41.200 --> 58:44.400]  This is the last run. It looks like survival short x2 in four store.com
[58:44.800 --> 58:48.400]  We're in fours life.com or triple a 253 3139
[58:48.400 --> 58:50.400]  I
[58:50.400 --> 58:52.400]  Want to plow into all of this
[58:52.800 --> 58:57.840]  Then I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that

[59:47.600 --> 01:00:07.600]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:16.800]  Hey, you can come inside if you are receiving this transmission. You are the resistance
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.680]  crtv.com is the amazing operation they got everybody from
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.120]  The great one mike levin to
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:43.120]  Eric bowling to gab mcganis to steven Crowder to you name it glad they're out there glad we're out here
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.760]  Glad drug report comms out there. Thank god for him
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.400]  Get off my lawn is this show on there and this shorter segment
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.960]  I want to get into tommy robinson. You're going to visit him. He could be in jail as early as tomorrow
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.200]  Again, we'll talk about that next segment. What a patriot is and what what he's facing
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.360]  But you were talking about during the break the threat of me being taken off paypal
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.520]  jihad watch being banned by visa. I mean, this is mark of the beast level
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:15.440]  Total control level stuff. I mean, this is the authoritarianism of this and you made another good point on top of that about airlines
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.520]  So so speak to that
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.160]  Well, my understanding is that delta refuses to
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:26.240]  Transport ice guys that have a detainee that are taking back an illegal immigrant
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:32.400]  So that's an example of a group not allowed on an airline if I was to go to a comedy club
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.920]  I guarantee you in new york, I would be tapped on the shoulder and asked to leave
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:41.920]  Ted Cruz and all these other conservatives can't eat at restaurants. We can't use visa
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.240]  We can't go on these platforms
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.480]  So it used to sound crazy to say soon utilities will be denied
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.920]  But I guarantee you hotels are next and soon after that it's going to be
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:01.840]  The providers cell phone providers that you know the the the social justice wars have gone mainstream and they are fascist
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:08.880]  They are socio fascists and they have their paramilitary wing the antifa and they are out there to enforce
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.000]  Tyranny we're really living in a dictatorship
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.480]  And let's be clear. You're right. They're the new royalty big tech with big media
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.960]  With the the hollywood with now the airlines and transportation
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.640]  And saying we're going to deny service to the government
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.240]  We're going to have a resistance that doesn't even follow the law and tries to block the president
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.640]  This is really their own form of corporate
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.560]  Martial law to block trump. I mean we have the rogue government and the rogue corporations
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.480]  76 of the kids don't even have parents with them. So we get their id try to fly them back to where they're from
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.720]  And the airlines won't even do it
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.560]  And you know the crazy part about all this is we have the king
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:54.080]  We have the king trump is in the castle with his armor on him. We go king trump
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:59.120]  Can you do something about this and he goes i'm killing as many as i can he's got his sword out going
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.840]  I'll get to you. This is insanity and we go. We're over here too. It's nuts king
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.520]  I mean he draining the swamp. I agree you've only killed 10,000 of the enemy get up off your ass and do more trap
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.040]  Yeah
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.760]  We thought we would I thought after the election that we the insanity would stop but it's just been ramped up
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.200]  That was my question. How crazy does it go as I asked you two years ago?
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.800]  What is peak sjw insanity and it's only getting more insane
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.760]  I'm going to put plywood on my windows
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.520]  after the midterms and i'm going to be on a boat with my family because
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:38.400]  Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned and these beta males and these lunatics the ones we saw dancing in front of
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:44.800]  Mike Pence's house like he cares who dances these lunatics are going to pop a gasket
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:50.000]  You thought the first election was bad and there's going to be literally riots fire on the streets
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  It's going to look like ferguson all over again with antifa stabbing fire hoses
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.200]  You don't want to be downtown when trump gets reelected when trump gets reelected
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.640]  wow
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.720]  Gavin what is your gut level prediction? I mean, I think if there's a fair election, we're going to have a red wave
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.720]  What do you think?
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:15.920]  I think that after the meltdown they've got to calm down right you know like when you take video games away from your kids
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.600]  They have that hysterical sort of 10 minutes where they can't believe what's happened
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:25.280]  And then eventually you'll see them they sort of dried their eyes and they're drawing a picture or reading a magazine like surely
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:32.800]  The temper tantrum has to have an expiration date on it. How long can you deny reality for?
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.440]  I mean, they're at the point now where they want to impeach
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.600]  Each pence because they're so sure that trump is done for
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.880]  It's it's just it's like a crazy ex-girlfriend who who boils your bunnies
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.760]  exactly and
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.160]  It'd be it'd be okay if hillary was like wonder woman

[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.040]  And he's about to fly to london england to talk to tommy robinson
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.440]  Who is set to have another hearing?
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.640]  He was already released for two and a half months for contempt of court covering a mass islamic pedophile ring
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:55.040]  Hearing that he had first exposed ten years ago. So he's just there saying it's happening
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:00.960]  And no judge no jury looked at any evidence the judges said you go right to prison. He lost 30 something pounds
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.320]  And gab mcginnis has got some great points on this
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.160]  But he thinks he's going to be sent back to prison. I'll be talking to tommy this afternoon
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.360]  And so a lot more on that front. So tell us what's coming up with that because hey, you're getting doxed
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.440]  You're getting banned on twitter. You're getting attacked
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.560]  I'm getting attacked, but at least we're not getting sent to prison
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:25.520]  Like you do in the uk if you talk about how part of radical islam is the keeping of young girls as sex slaves
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.600]  That's done all of the world in islamic countries
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.720]  It is very possible that on thursday
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:38.560]  Tommy robinson is sentenced to death for blaspheming islam. That is who is in control in that country. Oh, look, I got a call
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.880]  Shall I answer it?
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.960]  Go ahead. Yeah, this could be one of the
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.080]  Hello
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.800]  Hey, man, what's going on?
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.400]  But I think you uh
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.600]  Screenshot of who was that posted your number. I'm actually a fan. I just probably know what's on here. Oh, okay
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.160]  I'm on info wars. I thought it would be an enemy, you know, the enemies are a lot more interesting than the fans
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.160]  I don't like the fans want selfies and they want to say you rock and since this went mainstream
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.160]  I'm getting a lot of compliments. That's not as interesting as these commies saying
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.880]  Capitalism is doomed. But anyway, sorry to go back to time. No, but now that your phone's public
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:16.960]  I mean right now everybody call in the who wants to death retus that you there's the phone
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.880]  Or you want to tell us how our weewees are small and how your anti-racist because you said it
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.920]  So in any weird white soy boys that have half-inch weewees that are mad that we have seven inch ones
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.800]  You can call in right now because that's literally what they call you about, right?
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:35.280]  They're obsessed with their tiny black people and sex and and penises and stuff. It's it's depraved
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.680]  It's always it's always a mirror with the left every time they they get really vitriolic
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.000]  You get to see inside their mind and you realize you are the racist sexist homophobe
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.040]  Well, did you hear another professor got fired out in California for saying that women do not have genitalia men's genitalia
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:00.240]  I just thought what's a gynecologist supposed to do when he's presented with with male genitalia and this woman says
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.320]  All right, what should I do here and he's got to say?
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.640]  Well, uh, you have some serious issues because that looks a lot like a penis
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.480]  You didn't did you hear in the uk they have they have men coming with beards
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.680]  In fact one article quite large male genitals and they order the nurses this isn't sexual assault though
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.360]  Made up 36 years ago Kavanaugh falls on a bed. That's that's rape
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.080]  But when they go into the national health service and they get up and stirrups
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.880]  They've ordered the female nurses and male nurses to do pap smears on men's genitals
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.480]  Of course, it's impossible men don't have a cervix, but this is the new mental illness
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.120]  You know in 1984 o'brien just wants him to say two plus two equals whatever I want
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.480]  But in this world we have to literally have a man get up and stirrups and say do my pap smear
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.600]  Uh, your ovaries are doing really badly. I I can't find them. They look like vads deference
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.000]  But anyway, let me get back to Tommy Robinson
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.800]  So, uh contempt of court is usually a slap on the wrist. It's basically jaywalking in britain
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:00.240]  He was thrown away for 13 months in solitary confinement, but if he gets sent and now he's being re-sentenced
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.240]  I have no idea why you get to retry someone, but they're doing that if he is sent to prison on thursday
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.560]  He will be killed beyond a shadow of a doubt
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.280]  So that would be the death sentence for contempt of court
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:17.040]  Whereas the previous worst thing they had for contempt of court in britain was something like a 400 pound fine
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.760]  That the guy refused to pay and they said forget about it
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.720]  So you're essentially seeing a man get sentenced to death for a crime as bad as jaywalking
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.160]  And the truth of it is it comes down to blaspheming islam
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.960]  Now you can say whatever you want about christianity
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.520]  You can have jesus decapitated and danced around in trafalgar square. No one cares
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:40.000]  But you say something bad about islam in britain or you make a pedophile uncomfortable
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:46.000]  Boom death penalty and if people watch the video they're watching on tv when he got arrested for just covering the trial outside
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.560]  Which everybody else was doing the police look like they're so satisfied
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.120]  They're just relishing and then the judge came to the window and laughed and giggled and pointed
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:01.760]  I mean these people are the scum of the earth when the left gets the police power. Look out. You get mouths a tongue
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.120]  Isn't that the monarchy in a nutshell the king or the the the some
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.800]  Magistrate looking down from the the top tower of the castle looking down at the plebes
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:19.440]  Getting arrested for defying the king and smiling. How did we go back in time? Do we got to break out the pitchforks again?
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:27.680]  This is serious because you know the problem conservatives and libertarians like us is we're tough. We like a fight
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.880]  So every level of tyranny we just get used to it and fight it, but it is getting really
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:37.280]  High level. I mean it's getting to the point where they basically declared marshal law in the deep state against trump
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.800]  And so what does he do to block them when they're totally mutinous?
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.800]  Well, you know, you and I can take it. We're tough. They're going after families now. They're going after kids this drag queen's reading to kids
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:53.520]  A colorful person reading a book the agenda there is I can't take on Alex and Gavin
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:59.520]  They fight back too much. Let me go for a four-year-old and I'll go spread my propaganda on a child
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:06.160]  My marxist crap on them and they're they're not a worthy adversary. That's much simpler for them. They really have no
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.840]  Morals, I mean there's by the way. These aren't good-looking drag queens
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.560]  Why do all the ones they push on kids weigh 400 pounds and dressed it up in monster halloween?
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:20.160]  Costumes when I was a kid. I was scared of clowns. These are the most satanic looking clowns. I've ever seen
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.000]  They are clowns. I never knew how to I mean I live in New York City
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.520]  There's drag queens everywhere and you'd be at a party. There's a drag queen there and I've even heard gay people say
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.480]  I don't know how to talk to them. Like are you still your character?
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.920]  Can we talk about the weather? It is everything have to be in character
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.800]  It's like being at a halloween party and frankenstein is always going
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.120]  Like when do we talk about anything but
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.000]  Well, I mean these people look like hideous clowns
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.000]  I don't dislike somebody a man that wants dressed like a woman or if funny one is an adult
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.080]  Let's take chemicals to change whatever I
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.480]  There was a oh your anti-lgbt
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.320]  Because you don't want three-year-olds having obese people and clown outfits
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.400]  I mean that would scare the hell out of me when I was three years old Gavin. It scares me now
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:08.000]  I mean look at that and the holy hell that looks like one of the creatures from from uh power rangers one of the demons
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.040]  That goes ah power rangers. I will destroy you. Yeah
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.720]  Power rangers. Sorry go ahead
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.040]  Let's talk about gay and straight is talk about sexuality
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:25.600]  I don't want you talking to my three-year-old about sexuality pro against gay straight any of that stuff
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.680]  Why are they talking about second the gay march isn't I'm proud of my my heritage my culture
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.640]  I'm proud of the fact that gays are good at design and fashion and organizing furniture in your house
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.320]  The gay pride parade is about sex. I'm proud of the sex
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:47.280]  I have and this drag queen thing is inextricably linked to sexuality. You don't take your three-year-old to a gay pride parade
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.320]  I don't take my children my toddlers to anything sexual not even a rom-com. It's none of their business
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.520]  It's not their world. Listen. They had they had they had these big training events of last year and this year in austin
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:04.400]  The drag queen festivals and it's three-year-olds walking up and putting money in fat men's g-strings
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.000]  Shaking their asses and kids face if I went to a strip bar
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:14.960]  And I saw an adult there with a three-year-old putting money in a woman's g-string. I'd be just as offended. This is sexual
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.520]  Sexualization of children these people are amazingly twisted
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.360]  Look at the set of standards. We have to live up to and the set of standards
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:30.000]  They don't have to live up to Kavanaugh may have had a rude sexual encounter in high school 34 years ago
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.160]  Let's pillory him and charge him with rape for the rest of his life
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.160]  He's the rapist then you have their world where they got rapists all over the place
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:43.360]  You got Mika Rhodes Luke Kuhn in Antifa multiple sexual assaults
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:49.280]  Uh, uh, this guy the progressive punk. He's got he's a serial rapist and they just go
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.520]  Well, you know sexuality is fluid. Who knows what's going on with that story?
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:15:00.400]  They let themselves literally get away with murder and we can't fart without capitulating without these
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:06.320]  Apologies that sound like they're from BDSM where they say what I did was inexcusable and unforgivable
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.320]  It's it's clown. Well, yeah, it's like the left pushes fifty shades of gray that could get people in a really dangerous lifestyles
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.760]  And so they're into all this weird mutilation you name it
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.600]  But then oh my god Kavanaugh rolled around in the bed even if it's true. It's the end of the world
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.080]  It's it's it's insanity is what it is
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.960]  Well, the big picture here is obviously they're not playing fair. They're moving the goalpost. So let's stop playing
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.280]  They don't want to discuss things. We we have the the right is so naive when they go
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.320]  Well, if we could just get the truth to them we could convince them
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.840]  I've been dealing with these guys on the phone for the past 24 hours talking to them
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:43.040]  All they want to do is scream epithets and try to hurt your feelings. There's no interest
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.880]  I'll tell you why because it's it's like it's like 1d. You're just this object for them to larp on

[01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:01.520]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.800]  The real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:11.040]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.400]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:19.600]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.960]  We employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.400]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.480]  Next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:41.600]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:46.880]  As it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:52.480]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:57.120]  But more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:13.520]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.520]  You
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:33.520]  Waging war on corruption is alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:39.200]  All right, gab mcgannis of crtv.com has got to go he's got to jump on an airplane and go interview tommy robinson
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.000]  And before he could be back in prison tomorrow. Yes, he got out because the judge didn't even hear evidence
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.960]  Within one hour. He was sent directly to prison two and a half months
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:52.400]  And so we're you know, we're having fun talking about being dox being demonized being attacked because we're cheery about it
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.160]  This is really very very serious and you were saying some really great things about tommy
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.600]  During the break show it. So we got distracted
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.800]  You know on the people calling your doxed phone. Let's let's spend some time a few minutes here on tommy
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:08.560]  Well, the thing about tommy is when you see him and you hear about him you go
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.320]  Oh, it must be like braveheart to meet him
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:16.800]  He must be this sullen warrior like bill the butcher who just sits there and go your name's amsterdam. I'm new york
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.080]  But he's not like that. Oh, he's a giggly little elf
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:26.640]  Who's constantly laughing and playing pranks and stealing your beer and and giggling the guy is constantly giggling
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.440]  Now someone messes with him and he just knocks them out instantly with a perfect left hook
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:37.200]  But the the person himself is just such an enjoyable fun guy whose kids adore him
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.600]  He's always making them laugh and the fact that they are going to murder him
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:49.280]  Because he's not politically correct just shows how sinister the state can be and that's a canary in a coal mine
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.280]  by the way, we're not far from that
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.600]  And the islamists say they're going to kill him in prison and they did starve him
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.000]  He did lose 35 pounds when I saw him come out of jail
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.600]  And he went on Tucker Carlson. He was trying to get on my show, but they'd taken his phone
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.720]  So he didn't have my number anymore or he would have already been on and he's since been on
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:09.840]  Uh, he looked like he was like had that prisoner of war look to him in only two and a half months
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.840]  So I'm really worried about this
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:15.600]  You know if he's not I haven't talked to him much since he got out
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:22.000]  But if he's lost his humor and they broke him and he's sad now or just mean that will make me real mad
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.680]  I'm gonna blow a gasket and I'm glad you brought up the whole thing about oh
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.080]  We've been banned and they did this to our social media
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.760]  Meanwhile, we had 620,000 men die in the civil war
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:37.520]  Tommy is a real hero that though the civil war at them both sides. They're the real heroes
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.240]  They really understand sacrifice. We're just inconvenience. We can afford to laugh at it
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:48.160]  But I think it's important and I'm glad you did this to separate Tommy from us and say that this is another level
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.400]  Here he will be killed they threw boiling water on him in the previous time
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.600]  He was incarcerated and he managed to deke it out and take the guy down
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:00.960]  And there's a video him taking on nine Antifa guys and he's a little guy
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:07.120]  They're big guys. They're just true villains and all that Antifa will attack women. They'll attack children and they're proud of it
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.880]  They just have no honor Gavin. There's something missing
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.600]  I've never seen one of them punch
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:19.200]  Someone dead in the face straight on it's always from behind. It's always through a crowd. There's no honor there
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:23.680]  There's no chivalry and one thing I wanted to mention earlier by the way 50 percent of these texts
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:29.280]  I'm getting are white genocide white genocide genocide genocide genocide and I thought it was ironic because first of all
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:36.240]  Genocide is a very rare and bizarre a thing. It's very esoteric. I've never met anyone who wants genocide
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.400]  We had it with malosevic. I guess
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:43.920]  We had ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian war and we had it with pulp hot and obviously hitler and Stalin, but it is very
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.600]  esoteric
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.360]  And the only time you really see it is with socialists
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:53.040]  So isn't that ironic that all these socialists are talking about genocide?
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:58.800]  Meanwhile, they're the ones with the genocide all over the history books. They should be apologizing to us
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:03.440]  It really is incredible and you see them with metal batons
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.760]  Trying to kill people and they get their ass knocked out and then twitter takes down the video saying we're bullies
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.600]  No, you're bullies getting put on your asses and you can't stand it
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:20.480]  Unbelievable gab McGinnis. Thank you so much for spending time with us. Just lastly. I'm going to play this clip and eat your take
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:25.280]  What's up on info wars.com? It's the top story on drudge report dot com
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.920]  Top resistance member admits he gets paid by higher ups to southern division and it's a brian
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:38.720]  Crescent stens stunning admissions caught on camera. I think this is with the guy that twitter promotes the top under all of
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.960]  Trump's tweets here it is
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.960]  Or is that your job? It?
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:50.080]  I have several businesses, but you know the resistance is a really good group of people that's spread throughout the
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.840]  Country probably throughout the world. I mean it's just kind of
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.120]  It's just what I enjoy spending my time doing and
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.720]  And of course we get paid, you know, of course there is a higher ups pay us
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.560]  So so you're you're paid for this. It's not just like something you do because for your love of country
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.680]  Yeah, I mean they uh people pay us uh
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.640]  They they want us to help sew the division and to to take over trump's twitter feed when he makes a post
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:25.040]  They want arab tweets to be up there that they don't want they don't want other people to like trump support to be seen in that
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:32.000]  And that's why they got rid of info wars comments that had thousands of on every article also basing san francisco
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.800]  the whole uh
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:39.200]  Common existence we were using that was taken away because they don't want you to be able to meet
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.680]  They don't want you to be able to talk. They don't want you to have any
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.200]  Reassurance that other people think like you they want you isolated and alone just like shon parker said at facebook
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:54.160]  Their job was to isolate you make you alone and then have fake liberal bots that are your friends that slowly radicalize you gavin
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.960]  Well, you've been saying this forever and it was called a conspiracy theory
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:06.960]  But all a conspiracy means is that people are conspiring and now it's been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that people are conspiring
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:11.120]  This guy is admitting he gets money from up top that implies sorrows to me
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.960]  I've had nothing but hassles since I criticized sorrows. Ezra Levan has had nothing but lawfare since he criticized
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:24.080]  I saw you've had nothing but problems since you brought up these people conspiring and conspiracy theories just used as a negative term now
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.800]  And they shut you down. You say, hey, are you guys conspiring? No, and you're shut down for asking
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:35.200]  Hmm that seems unusual doesn't it and then they have big tech meeting in secret to continue it. It's incredible
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:39.040]  Well, we'll be watching crtv.com and we'll obviously play some clips here when you talk to Tommy
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.680]  He'll probably be on with us today or tomorrow as well got the big court case tomorrow be safe gab McGinnis
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.400]  Thank you, sir. Thanks for having me you bet
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.240]  Wow, I tell you these are just crazy times and we are separating here the level Tommy said
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.720]  With the level we're at but we're quickly going into that level of persecution and I'm not happy about that
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.360]  But they talk about
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.680]  They go low we go high they've already gone to the very very bottom ladies and gentlemen. These are not liberals
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.800]  These are authoritarian monsters now listen
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.960]  We do have two specials three specials up at the same time right now
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.520]  Because I haven't gotten rid of the x-tube
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.680]  25% off special and we have the new 40% off best-seller

[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.040]  Plus now a 20% more each bottle and the amazing secret 12 pure
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:36.880]  Strong vitamin B12 metha cabalamin and acetate filled cabalamin if I'm saying it right the two work together in unison
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.400]  Buzzfeed even had our stuff tested and found it was the strongest best vitamin B12 in the market
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.800]  Because they said oh, Jones's is okay. It was pure but this is the best brand ours is private life
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.360]  ours is private label from that morons show
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.480]  Buzzfeed found that we have the
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.600]  Very best vitamin B12 on the market at the lowest price
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.520]  I always enjoy that bloop in their face and they're trying to shut us down
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:06.640]  We have eight business days left with PayPal as one of our main payment processors
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.440]  So you might want to dump your PayPal wallets
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:15.680]  They're an info or store.com on water filtration air filtration nonzuma lmc books t-shirts supplements and help fund the info
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.880]  War as a protest and then cancel PayPal
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:23.280]  And I've got a treat for PayPal the next few days as well. So I'll leave it that but
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.560]  Expanding on all of that last run of x2. I hope to get another deeper source
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:31.680]  But with the oil company that gets us at 12,000 feet
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.640]  I've not been able to make a deal and they keep jacking up the price to show
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.640]  I broke the contract and this is the last run of x2 the amazing good halogen
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:44.720]  Hopefully we get a replacement info or store.com enforce life.com or triple a 2533139 and

[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.840]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:19.840]  Waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:30.800]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, there's a reason they want info wars off the air and it's because
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:36.560]  I've studied geopolitical systems since I was 10 years old because I just
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.160]  was attracted to it and got into history books and
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.360]  learned how they operate
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.360]  and I
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:50.320]  I'm able to make predictions that are spot on over and over again. Everybody knows that and I can see pre-programming
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.400]  But these predictions weren't hard
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.160]  last
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:55.280]  Tuesday
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.680]  I did a live feed here. We put the clip up on real dot video and on info wars.com
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:06.240]  And it had the headline that alex jones predicts democrats are going to roll out more women
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.960]  Specifically three more after four
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:11.840]  And I said one will be the weekend before the vote
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.640]  And then one will be two days before the vote and then another will be the night before the vote
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:24.960]  Well, they've now and I bet he said last night it'll be 48 hours. That'd be the night before the vote. So I weigh 100
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:28.960]  percent perfect prediction. And
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:33.040]  I go into how I know it's fake and all the rest of it takes hours
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.160]  That's what knowledge is what wisdom is is just so much
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:42.960]  It take all day to explain it, but a lot of it's they didn't bring out the stuff six seven weeks ago. They waited till the last minute
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.240]  It's meant to fall apart. It doesn't matter the next fraud covers the last fraud
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:50.960]  But it's unraveling even faster
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.400]  The cd weirdo lawyer ann of eddie
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.480]  locks twitter admits cabinock user might not appear
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.080]  This other one. He said we're going to get into the definition of intercourse of penetration
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.040]  all these
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.200]  Channelizing points
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.640]  Meanwhile, cabinock's come out and said I didn't have sex until in the middle of college
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.440]  We're going to play a powerful clip here in a moment. Also
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:23.200]  I'm Tucker Carlson with the interview and more but this whole thing is unraveling very quick. Mike Adams is another big report bombshell
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.960]  Christine blazey Ford's letter to senator diane feinstein revealed to be a total fake contains 14
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.320]  Glaring errors that could only be committed by poorly educated writer
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.960]  So we're going to get into all of that as well
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:42.080]  But but this is a five minute clip. We're going to post it in full wars.com. I probably won't play all of it
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.880]  But here I am last tuesday
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  because that was the 19th
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.560]  Laying out exactly
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.920]  The exact because I could just I know how they operate. It's like I even asked us. How do you always know this stuff?
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.880]  It's like you just you just get the feel for these turds
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:04.480]  Because you know phonies when you see it and then you think well, how do they done in the past and how will they
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.520]  Try to cover the last fraud the next fraud here it is
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.560]  And so mark my words
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:16.640]  There are more women who are either going to see this in the news and figure out that they went to the same town
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:20.880]  And the same school the same areas cabinon that are going to have the memories
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.200]  the snowball
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.800]  The mockingbird effect
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:29.680]  But they're not going to need to do that because they're getting contacted just like the sun came up this morning by the
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.960]  Washington Post the new york times buzzfeed think progress the southern prairie law center
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.600]  the adl media matters
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.240]  All of them are using data mining and are hounding and calling
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:49.520]  Every woman in that town where cabinon grew up. We're going over that here today. So how do you respond to that?
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.800]  You have to data mine the republicans have to
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:58.080]  Legally and lawfully and they have to contact because a bunch of the women are going to go. Yeah
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.680]  I got called six weeks ago within days of him being the nominee
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.680]  And they were really really pushy, but I remember Brett being a great guy
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.840]  They've obviously already contacted them. They got 65 women saying he's a real sport
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:15.040]  But I guarantee you they've been contacted by the democrats
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.880]  You roll them out it's game over
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.840]  This woman has all the telltale signs
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.720]  Of doing this for political gain
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:34.800]  And if you know how they operate they go through democratic party databases. They've got a super activist professors operatives like this lady
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.640]  And then they put out feelers
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:44.480]  To anyone that they can cross reference that was the same age lived in the same town as their target
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:47.440]  I've gotten calls
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:50.080]  From dozens of former high school associates
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:54.640]  Who didn't even really know me may have talked to me may have been in class with me
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:38:01.920]  Saying hey, uh, do you remember me and I'm like I barely do the new york times the washington post buzzfeed is calling me
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.040]  And then when I told them nothing but nice stuff they called back and said well
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:12.160]  We'll do a big profile on you if you tell us something and then closer associates that actually worked around me
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.320]  They start threatening them
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:19.200]  Well, you're going to be in this piece. It's going to be very damaging to you unless you tell us
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.280]  And so what they do is they then have law firms and media
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.400]  Contact everyone in the database
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:30.000]  And say wow you went to school at Brett Kavanaugh. Didn't you?
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:33.040]  They lead them
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.040]  Are you at the school of alex jones?
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.520]  I heard he was a pretty bad guy
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.760]  And if they say, oh, no, he's a great guy. We'll go. Well, thanks a lot click
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:47.040]  Oh, yeah, Brett Kavanaugh. He's terrible. Yeah. Yeah. I went to school them. Yeah, you didn't know that
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.440]  Yeah, it's it's here in the school annual and you were two years younger than him and
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.040]  You see how that works
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:58.160]  See how that works and then now you're like, yeah, I remember
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.840]  You know, the democrats are calling every woman that grew up in the same town as kavanaugh
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:08.240]  And they're contacting with databases of anybody that is a hillary
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:12.240]  Clinton loving man hating leftist like this man hating
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.080]  leftist professor who's expunged her social records
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:22.000]  Covering all this up. They sit on it for six weeks until these days out from confirmation vote
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.800]  Next week and then they drop this
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:30.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know they've contacted a whole slew of women
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:36.880]  And I know their pattern they're gonna release one lady. Let her get hit by the barb wire
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.880]  Let it be criticized and then boom release another woman and then another woman
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.440]  And they're all going to be former democratic party
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.480]  Operatives, they're all gonna be
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.920]  The pussyhat wearers. They're all going to be the same very cut
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:03.200]  And the key to congress is getting ahead of this and demanding an investigation into who contacted them
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:07.360]  And swearing them in under oath and demanding discovery
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.160]  You heard here first. There will be more women
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:17.040]  In the next week and a half that come out ahead of the confirmation vote next week and the republicans blink
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.040]  And have a bunch of show trial hearings and a bunch of virtue signaling like
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360]  Different white house officials are now saying
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.960]  Kavanaugh will not get confirmed and there will be women coming forward and accusing every
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.720]  nominee that trump brings forward period
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:42.800]  This is the strategy. This is how they create the snowball effect
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:47.600]  The democrats also to come after me and trump and others we've confirmed it
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:51.760]  They've admitted it media matters a year ago leaked a document where they battle planet
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.480]  George Soros funds it
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.120]  They will run a database of everybody you went to college with high school with or worked with
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:06.320]  They have databases now and they have groups that go back at your annuals get the names and then run those through
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.560]  If you went to school pre-internet
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.560]  So how do you respond to that?
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:13.280]  You have to data mine the republicans have to
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.560]  Legally and lawfully and they have to contact because a bunch of the women are going to go. Yeah
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.920]  I got called six weeks ago within days of okay. That's good
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:26.320]  And by the way, whoever grabbed from me from ours on tuesday and put this together did a great job
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:29.440]  What what i'm really looking for and this was great. I I want the clips
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:33.280]  I remember saying it that they'll bring it out the weekend before the next woman
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.440]  and then
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.440]  about three days before the
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:42.240]  Final vote they'll have another and then they'll have another the night of the day of the vote
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:48.480]  So I know I said specifically what they're doing, but still it's good enough what we got there show
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.560]  People need to learn I don't just say this stuff. Okay
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:59.360]  I live this. This is all I do. It's I dream about this at night. All I do is study. I am totally immersed
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.880]  And we know their operations now when I come back very powerful Tucker Carlson point
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.560]  He's the smartest guy on fox news
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:09.760]  uh
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:13.040]  Hannity's great and very dynamic and and wonderful and everything and but
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.600]  Tucker is the smartest person on fox news
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.280]  And he just goes right to the heart that no one else is pointing out except us
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:21.280]  Where's the due process?
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:27.040]  Where's the innocent until proven guilty the the mantra by the democrats
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.040]  With me or anybody else is we sue you. You're guilty
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.960]  We have a russia investigation. You're guilty a woman says 36 years ago. You did something none of it adds up
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.280]  None of the witnesses say you're telling the truth. It doesn't matter

[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.400]  I
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.720]  Told you that trump was going to win the 2016 election
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:26.000]  I told you that the new york times algorithm that said 98 chance
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.360]  Hillary was going to win until election day
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.760]  was as phony
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.760]  as a plastic banana
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:35.840]  That met a three dollar bill
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.920]  That had lunch for the easter bunny
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:40.720]  At the tea party in allison wonderland
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:46.880]  And the table cloth was obama's birth certificate. That's fake
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:49.920]  show
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:51.920]  Pulling back from all this
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:57.120]  We can sit here and be very positive about everything but
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:00.400]  I knew how hysterical they were the last three months
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:05.680]  And when they were and when they were saying hillary 100 percent is invincible
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.480]  She will be president
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:11.360]  There were a whole bunch of big bot companies
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:14.640]  That can track with ai
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:22.800]  What you're saying and what you're doing your text messages and your private messages on twitter facebook youtube and
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:28.880]  They had experts calling all that they also had all these real surveys going on
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:34.000]  By tech companies of their own people and then real polls you
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:39.520]  Look the polls you see on the news are usually skewed by whoever pays for them. There's fully three dollar bill
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.680]  As I just said
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:48.400]  But you know they do real polls. They do internal polls and they showed trump with a
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:51.120]  15-point lead
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:57.680]  He dipped to like a five-point lead on the first debate and and I talked to folks that had seen the polls
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:00.480]  And I'm I'm not liberty to get into it, but I'm just gonna stop right there
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:06.640]  And that's when I went crazy and drudge linked to it all of it and said trump you better get aggressive buddy or you're done
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:09.680]  Whoever talked him into being nice to her at the first debate
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:14.960]  Not a good idea. He came out said you need to go to prison. You're a piece of filth. Here's the women
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:18.160]  You know you rape bill clinton boom back to 15 points
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:22.720]  Here's the problem
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.600]  They've got illegals and people vote in the names of dead folks
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.640]  everywhere in what like 30-something states where democrats had control
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.720]  They're scared because republicans have control of the majority of states now and are reversing that bringing in
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:43.280]  Voter motor ID and you gotta have a driver's license. Of course you gotta have a driver's license
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.240]  The democrats are saying let illegals vote let people vote. In fact, I never played this last week pull it up
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.080]  Democrats in speeches say vote early and vote often
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:55.200]  Bill Clinton talked about that. So did Obama
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:58.720]  So I want to be a hundred percent clear
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:03.040]  I go to the mall
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.360]  And I like to go to a more
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:11.600]  Work in class slash middle class mall because there's these malls in austin. They're like just too fancy for me
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.520]  I like going to the old-fashioned Barton Creek mall once you know 110 degrees
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  Kind of walk the kids around get some exercise go eat, you know go shopping a little bit
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.880]  I get mobbed
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:26.080]  By hispanics
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:30.000]  The conservative families the liberal families the guys with tattoos and gold chains
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.360]  mobbed, I mean love me
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:39.920]  Because they want america. They want free market. They want success and and they get being mavericks
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.040]  Mobbed hispanics are my biggest fans
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.000]  In austin. I've experienced all over texas. I mean a little big town and walking to some barbecue place
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  I'm just mobbed by the hispanic folks
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.360]  Because they're americans and they smell BS
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.880]  Now the leftist hispanics being brainwashing campuses, you know, not so much. That's that's everybody going there
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:06.960]  But black folks white people you name it, but if I go to a university area or a upper middle class or rich white area
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.440]  I'm going to a birthday party
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:11.440]  With one of my daughters and it's a mansion
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:16.320]  And I'm pulling up and I'm gonna like a car. I'll pull by the Mercedes and go f you Alex Jones
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:21.360]  And it's like a hundred and fifty thousand dollar Mercedes and my girls are with me. This happened a few weeks ago
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:23.440]  I don't say anything. I just go
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:28.880]  I'm gonna say something like you and it's always some rich woman some rich and I'm not putting white people down
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:31.600]  But let me tell you the jerks are rich white people. Okay
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:36.480]  80% of the democrat 80% of congress the money is democrats
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:40.560]  There's this idea that conservatives have the money. No, they don't
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:47.360]  No, they don't I'm not doing class envy here. The middle class is mainly conservative, but the rich people
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:52.960]  They game everything. They want government control. They're the jerks
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:58.720]  And man, you look at all these professors and everyone nine times out of ten. It's some weird
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:02.080]  Watt job liberal white dude or woman
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:10.560]  Up there preaching the opposite of martin luther king document cam shot, please watch it on tv. Here's martin luther king
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:13.520]  MLK
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:17.680]  Here is hillary rodham clinton
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:25.040]  She's over here with sexual and racial divide and martin luther king's over here. Well, I'm right here
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:28.160]  The left is over here
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:29.760]  And it's a fact
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:31.760]  You're not with martin luther king
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:34.560]  And that's just the fact she better get used to that
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:37.840]  So
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:39.840]  Trump is going to win
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:45.600]  You're going to win unless the fraud is of such a magnitude and they get into computers
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:51.200]  But they caught them stealing. What was it? I always get it flipped. They caught hillary stealing
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:54.480]  five states
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:59.840]  And homeland security at the local level caught them trying to steal six others
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.200]  They said homeland security computers are breaking into state computers in a live time trying to flip votes
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:12.160]  So here's the deal. The red wave is real. Trump is going to win. You're going to win. We're going to win unless the fraud
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:17.760]  Is just off the charts. So don't worry. Even if they steal it. We have the hearts and minds. I've seen it
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:21.200]  I go to barton creep mom
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:27.680]  Go to the cheesecake factory and like
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:32.800]  10 waiters come over black white hispanic all of them wanting photos and autographs
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:36.640]  Oh, I heard the show last week. It's a great and then a hispanic family buys me dinner
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:40.000]  And I'm like, no, no, no, no, don't do it. Oh, no, we already did it. Stop it
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.520]  And then I go outside and it's it's all this then I see some
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.120]  Deranged looking white woman with a kid looks like their own prose act. She's like
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:52.400]  And it's like you're one out of a hundred lady. You're losing
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:56.000]  I'm a public figure. I'm a bellwether. I can tell you
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:06.160]  It's not conservatism. It's free market. It's people wanting to not be played off of people are sick of racism
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:10.320]  They're sick of the left pushing it constantly. You'd have to be an idiot not to see what they're doing
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.880]  It's backfired on you. So keep pushing
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:15.520]  Keep pressuring people
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:19.040]  Let's play a few minutes of Tucker Carlson. They'll land all this out. Whatever happened to
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:26.640]  Guilty until proven innocent in the Soviet Union. We know that's a bad thing. We're innocent until proven guilty
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:29.040]  Whatever happened to us waking up to that here at esh
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:37.600]  Well, good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight Brett Kavanaugh just finished speaking with Martha McCallum
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:42.400]  He pushed back pretty aggressively against attacks on his personal integrity and his decency
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:46.640]  And he denied completely all of the sexual allegations against him
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:53.440]  In doing that he at times provided a level of information about his personal life that would have been unthinkable just days ago
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:57.440]  Through all these years that are in question you were a virgin
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.400]  That's correct
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:02.800]  Never had sexual intercourse with anyone in high school
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:08.000]  Correct and through what years in college since we're probing into your personal lives there many years many years after
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  I'll leave it at that many years after
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:18.400]  Wow, not your conventional interview. He was asked repeatedly by Martha again about the accusations against him his wife sat by him as he denied all of them
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:25.360]  I'm not gonna let false accusations drive us out of this process and
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:31.440]  We're looking for a fair process where I can be heard and defend the
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:34.560]  My integrity my lifelong record
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:38.400]  Nobody expected anything like this when that confirmation process started
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:43.280]  We're gonna have more from Martha's interview with Brett Kavanaugh and his wife Martha herself will join us on the set
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:46.640]  A little bit later in the show to tell us what it was like in that room
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:53.120]  But first we typically open this hour by talking to someone we disagree with we believe in straightforward debate on this show
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:58.160]  Americans have been talking through their differences for more than 200 years and it's worked pretty well
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.160]  We think all of us reach wiser conclusions
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:04.320]  When both sides have their say when everybody gets to talk and we'll continue to do that
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:09.120]  But tonight we want to pause for a minute. We'll invite guests on later in the hour first though
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.920]  It's worth considering what we've learned from the debate over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:19.120]  This feels like a turning point something entirely new in the life of this country
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:24.800]  We certainly had bitter and partisan debates over judicial nominations before a lot of them Robert Bork in 87
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:27.280]  Clarence Thomas four-year-old
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:34.160]  Bork in 87 Clarence Thomas four years later. There are many others shortly after being reelected president in 1936
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:39.760]  Franklin Roosevelt tried to take over the entire judicial branch of government packing the court with extra democrats
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:42.960]  So he could impose his program on congress by force
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.040]  Thankfully fdr failed in that but the point is a lot of this is not new
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:54.400]  Politics has always intruded on our justice system. Congress confirms the nominees. So it's inherently political always has been
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:58.960]  Yet some of this we have not seen before it's entirely new
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:04.960]  Never in our lifetimes have sitting members of congress attacked our justice system as they now are
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:11.760]  Lawmakers haven't mocked the idea of due process or called for the collective punishment of American citizens
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:15.920]  Or declared that the burden of proof is on the accused rather than the accuser
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:19.200]  All of that is happening right now in washington and more
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:27.040]  It's not just Brett Kavanaugh who's under assault election officials have announced they no longer believe in our western understanding of justice
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:28.640]  All right, we're gonna hit pause
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:32.480]  We're gonna come back and play this what the democrats saying look if a woman accuses you go to prison
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:37.680]  No judge. No jury. You're just going to prison. I mean this this is a power grab
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:43.040]  Meanwhile, the same democrats support radical Islam literally wholesale enslaving women
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.640]  Third hour, you know, open the phones up as well. Stay weather spread the links
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:51.520]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:57.680]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:03.920]  That's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the usa
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:10.880]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:16.640]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that i personally have been taking for over a year
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:22.640]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:27.520]  You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:35.120]  That patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you the remnant of america
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:39.520]  To reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:43.040]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together. We're changing the world now
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:46.560]  It's time to change our bodies with z shield info wars live.com
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:54.560]  Just like our information is game changing our products are game changing and survival still next to is the pure iodine
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:59.680]  No one else has this from deep earth crystals between seven to twelve thousand feet. It's very hard for me to get
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:01.920]  It's the good halogen
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:08.800]  But instead they hammer you with the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromine that literally fog you fill out all your cells
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:14.720]  Your thyroid you name it mild truth selenium goes with it like a horse of carriage selenium is an electrochemical
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.840]  It's needed as well in all
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:20.160]  activity in the body particularly
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:21.600]  neurons
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:28.320]  So these go incredibly well together. We have a combo of those just experience it for yourself. Why do you think they fear me so much?
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.040]  Very simple stuff filter your water
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:36.480]  Yeah, I find myself some water filters best out there for the price when I say it's the last run
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:40.000]  I think it'll be six months a year until we get more. I hope we get more
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:43.200]  This is the last run. It looks like survival short x2 m4 short.com
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:47.200]  Renfors live.com or triple a two five three three one three nine
[01:59:47.200 --> 02:00:03.600]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:19.200]  Time
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:28.320]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:33.040]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.760]  It's alex jones
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:40.080]  Guilty until proven innocent. That is the new democrat pre-dobe
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:42.960]  If you're a man
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:44.960]  Shit alien shut up
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:46.960]  This is our big open free society
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:53.760]  Creating a vacuum for authoritarians to come in and say because they're a woman or whatever that
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:58.720]  All due process is thrown out the window. Here's Tucker Carlson breaking it down
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:03.920]  The accuser all of that is happening right now in washington and more
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:06.720]  It's not just Brett Kavanaugh who's under assault
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:11.760]  Elected officials have announced they no longer believe in our western understanding of justice
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:18.240]  There's no precedent for that here. It's stunning. You should pay close attention to what's happening because it could affect all of us
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:23.760]  The shift began late last week with these remarks from hawaii senator mazzi harona. Watch
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:28.080]  I just want to say to the men of this country to shut up and step up
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:36.080]  Do the right thing for change not only do women like dr. Ford who bravely comes forward need to be heard
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:38.320]  But they need to be believed
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:43.600]  So there you have it all men are guilty not because they've been proved guilty
[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:49.120]  But because they are men they are inherently guilty by their nature all women
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:52.240]  Must be believed not because we can show they're telling the truth
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:58.080]  But because they are female evidence is irrelevant in both cases. All that matters is dna
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:04.400]  All of us are condemned or redeemed at birth and there is nothing any of us can do to change that is baked in the cake
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:10.160]  Can pause real quick. She said we're we're not here that like hitler. That's what I mean. The left
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:13.680]  knows racism works with dumb down people
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:21.200]  And so they're double crossing the entire social compact in america and worldwide. They are literally promoting
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:25.360]  Just outrageous crap
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:30.720]  Don't look at somebody about who they are and what they do. Look at what sex they are what color they are
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:35.680]  It's outrageous, but they're betting. You're idiots. I'm betting
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:38.880]  Trump is betting matt drudge is betting
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:44.880]  Patriots are betting tucker crawlsson is betting that you're not like that. Let's continue
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:49.200]  Living u.s. Center has ever said anything like that in public
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:54.560]  Yet none of ferrano's democratic colleagues were coiled or even scolded her suggested she was wrong
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.800]  They seem to agree with what she said
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:02.400]  Hirona herself did not issue an apology or a clarification. She kept going here. She is from of the weekend
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:07.440]  Doesn't cavanaugh have the same presumption of innocence as anyone else in america?
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:15.040]  I put his denial in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches his cases
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:23.120]  Well give her credit for directness according to senator ferrano brett cavnaugh is not protected by the united states constitution
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:29.040]  He does not enjoy the presumption of innocence cavnaugh is guilty because his opponents say he is guilty
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:34.640]  That is senator ferrano's position. She is proud of it. It's possible. Yeah, we're going to come back and play more of this
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:37.840]  And when we put this up on info wars dot com on our own streams the full thing
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:39.760]  But
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:44.400]  You understand they lie about what I say about sandy hook or they lie about then they sue me
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:49.680]  Now they know they're going to lose those lawsuits. So now they just want me off the air and want our payment processor shut down
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:54.480]  But just the suit then becomes the reality and I talked to cbs. I talked to new york times
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:59.600]  I say I believe it happened. Here's videos of me three years ago saying it but the public questioned it. Here's the anomalies
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:01.600]  We have a right to do that
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:03.600]  They never publish it
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:07.520]  And they go now that jones is being sued. He says it happened
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:10.640]  Just like they say that I say get your battle rifles ready
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:15.440]  I won't even say it or they'll put it out on air, but you can say that I'd say attack the media ever said that
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:21.760]  Again, they aren't following any rules folks. No chivalry. No decorum. No civilization
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:25.600]  They're a lawless group these globalists are the mainstream media
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:28.240]  of just
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.240]  Tears
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:34.080]  But the good news is the world is rejecting them. They're all their own leftist
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:40.400]  Law firm bubbles, but it's kind of come crashing down on all these arrogant sobs
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:43.040]  We'll be back when we get to the end of the video
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:50.000]  We'll be back. We'll give the number out take your calls as well. We we are innocent until proven guilty
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:54.080]  Two plus two does equal four. This is america and she's coming back
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:00.240]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now
[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:03.920]  Info awards is being openly targeted at the democratic party
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:06.960]  Leftist cia operatives the corrupt justice department
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:11.520]  And the entire soros crime syndicate people say why would you start a fight with them?
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:17.600]  Because they were already dominating and running america into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this
[02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:20.080]  So we've already had incredible success
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:27.520]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:33.280]  And if you financially support us if you spread the word about our articles and videos m4s.com
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.240]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:41.280]  We have huge sales m4s.com right now
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:45.040]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.640]  Despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:54.960]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially soros the global spain win. This is infor's darkest hour. We do your support
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:57.040]  I'm counting on you
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  50 000 unstoppable watts
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:08.400]  Live from austin, texas broadcasting worldwide
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:13.280]  It's alex jones. I'm gonna give the number out next segment and take your calls
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:18.720]  But I want right now to air part of the speech. I gave at the free alex jones rally that was
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:22.960]  Taking place this saturday. Here it is transmitting worldwide
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:26.880]  So you folks are awesome to come out here. This whole impromptu thing is great
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:29.920]  But let's free america and free the world and free the internet
[02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:31.920]  Yeah
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:40.320]  And just today trump put out the leaked version of the executive orders to start busting up big tech
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:42.720]  And the communist chinese operation
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:46.800]  And the communist chinese
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:52.320]  Allied with the globalists have literally taken control of much of this country and shut us industrially down
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:56.320]  The president trump is reversing all of that and that's what big tech
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:59.040]  That's what big tech isn't just censoring me
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:05.520]  They're censoring all of you and tens of millions of others in america and billions of people worldwide
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:11.280]  Because google and facebook and twitter and apple have always been evil
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.200]  They is their leftist cover
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:19.760]  As the excuse for all the evil they do google has always been evil
[02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:25.760]  And now the head of google lied and said they don't censor conservatives. That is a total lie
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:31.360]  And everyone knows that they do it
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:38.240]  So here's the good news. We have the undercover video. We have their emails. We have their own head people admitting it
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:41.920]  We have them lying. We have them refusing to go before congress
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:47.360]  google has refused to work with the us military with its ai program
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:51.120]  But officially works with the government of china because they love
[02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:56.880]  And it's not that our government's perfect but compared to the communist chinese, good god
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:08:03.760]  They killed 110 million of the wrong people. That's five times what hitler killed and they think we're a bunch of idiots
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:09.200]  They think that we don't understand what's happening. They think they're gonna lie. They play the semantical game. They go
[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.280]  We don't censor christians
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:18.240]  We don't censor conservatives. We don't censor libertarians. We don't censor anybody who says but we censor hate
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:24.080]  So then they define conservatism and nationalism as hate and that's how they play this game
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:27.520]  The truth is google, apple, facebook, twitter
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:35.840]  Their terms of service say you can't be a christian or conservative or nationalist or patriot and they are criminal frauds
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:38.480]  And their entire operation
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:41.440]  Is going down. Let me tell you something
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:45.360]  Since the 70s the globalists have moved all our jobs to china
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:49.760]  They've moved it all there to exploit the planet, but china doesn't have raw materials
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.760]  Their supply lines are cut off and these executive orders that trump is about to execute
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:00.960]  Cut off china and cut off the eu and cut off big tech
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:12.240]  They thought they had america down the last minute and they had all their followers and their collaborators and their leftist
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:18.880]  Raised with the minimalist brainwashing and propaganda on these universities. They thought they had america
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:21.200]  But just like every time it's happened
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:27.280]  It doesn't get better until the last minute of the last hour and now the sleeping giants of humanity
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:34.160]  Not just here, but from areas of europe to south america to asia are waking up to the authoritarian globalists
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:42.400]  And just because just because the arrogant criminals at google and facebook and twitter
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:48.160]  Have already gotten away with censorship and spying on you and working with china to arrest dissidents
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.960]  Does it mean they'll get away with it forever?
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:10:01.280]  And by and by confronting them we got them to move early with the censorship they were planning after the election
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:09.040]  And after we got them to move early, they've now been exposed and they've now been caught live
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.920]  And there's no way they'll ever overcourt
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:18.880]  But look i'm glad that all you guys had this free hour shows rally and that's awesome
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:23.440]  And i'm glad your honor. You notice the anti-fascam funded by the leftist is here
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:31.120]  Because their terrorist funding by soros has come out and all over the country when they come out and attack people
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:36.800]  Even in blue cities like austin they're getting their asses arrested because they are terrorist criminals
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:43.280]  They're the terrorist criminals they want to tell us we don't have free speech
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:53.280]  And they want to assault women and children well guess what assholes you thought you'd defeat america all you did was wake her up
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:06.000]  They think they could censor you they think they could censor me they think that the intimidation that works on their slaves works on us
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:13.280]  All it does is motivate us to take action and that's what we're doing here today
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:18.400]  So remember the globalist head of
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:22.160]  Google says they're not censoring any conservatives
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:25.280]  We have a slow promotional video
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:30.240]  Two years ago when they lost the election 20 months ago admitting that don't worry
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:33.360]  We'll hand it back to the democrats after this we'll stop trump
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:40.640]  And we have all their internal documents and all their admissions, and that's why that arrogant person who's allied with china
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:45.120]  Helping senate censorship search engines to round up political dissidents
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.360]  They'd love to do that here, and it's what they're building here, and it's what they're doing here
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.440]  But their own employees were told
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.080]  This week and they leaked it
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:57.040]  You must erase off your personal computers
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:04.960]  Everything about our secret dragonfly program with china for a world-wide censorship program, and their own employees
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:09.360]  Alerted the media so the beginning of the end has begun
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:16.400]  Google and facebook and twitter
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:22.160]  Traders in our government created an NSA system to spy on us, but they knew there were checks and balances
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:27.200]  So they transferred it to private consortiums, and they moved it to china
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:30.160]  To set up operations against america
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:35.040]  What do you think the last 34 years have been is the beginning of the year
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.280]  China will have its raw materials completely cut off within six months
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:44.400]  US fleets are now surrounding it. We already have deals with russia
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:47.520]  China and the communists are going down
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:52.320]  America holds all the cards
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:13:02.480]  And the quislings inside the democratic party and inside the corporate media and inside hollywood better get ready to lose lose lose
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:08.480]  Because america is getting ready to win win win
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:15.360]  And like president truck says you're gonna get so sick of winning and winning and winning and winning
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:20.800]  You're gonna say am i good i'm getting sick of this winning i'm gonna say sorry just get ready for more winning
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:30.320]  The dirty murdering leftist in hollywood the pedophile devil worshipers allied with the evil communist chinese
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:34.960]  They think they'll break america's will
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:42.000]  They think because they censor us on their platforms. It'll make us go away. It's just gonna make us hit the strings
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:49.360]  I want to encourage everyone of you to realize don't look for alex jones deletion or donald trump deletion
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:53.280]  You keep doing your videos on your own platforms and the enemy's platforms
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:57.520]  And you construct their systems and you get in their face and you expose them when they go
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:03.280]  Oh alex jones is mean he questioned public events. Oh alex jones is bad. That's them projecting
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:10.160]  They're the ones working for the authoritarian regimes like the eu and the communist chinese that have killed over 100 million
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:12.160]  Of their own poor sweet people
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:14.960]  They're the leftist media that funded the arab spring
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:20.000]  They killed over two million people and brought total tyranny to a bunch of our allies the middle east
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:26.560]  They're the calm blooded criminals that want to use their power of super tech to oppress humanity
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:31.200]  And monsters like tim cook
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:38.160]  With his slave factories at foxcon and apple and all the rest of these people think where they're slaves
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:40.800]  They think that we are going to submit to them
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:45.600]  But the truth is you have awoken and nothing's going to stop you and the enemy knows it
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:50.560]  So as long as you stay the course
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:53.200]  As long as you take action
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:57.680]  As long as you stand up to all the power tripping little weirdo
[02:14:58.160 --> 02:15:04.160]  Professors and all the scum that have been promised that they'll have the spoils of what's left of america
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:08.160]  As long as you do that you are unstoppable
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:14.960]  All these leftists and authoritarians try to intimidate us because they're cowards
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:18.560]  They think cozying up under the establishment gives them power
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:24.000]  They think that when we get censored and attacked that makes us give up. We're trying to change the world
[02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:26.480]  We expected to have this fight happen
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:31.600]  We expected to be persecuted. We expected to be attacked. And guess what? Here's the good news
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:36.000]  A lot of people in history fight tyranny and they don't see results in their lifetimes
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:39.200]  But you know what? We're seeing results right now

[02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:16.000]  They came and took it away

[02:20:27.120 --> 02:20:32.240]  But I'm gonna try now in this segment and then open the phones up and take your calls because those are so amazing
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:39.040]  But faith goldie is this super good-looking super smart
[02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:42.960]  awesome libertarian conservative lady in toronto
[02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:49.360]  And she's been with the rebel and she's been with newspapers and she's been censored up there and they're so scared of her
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:52.400]  Because she's super smart super good-looking
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:56.720]  They claim they love women in the left. No, no, they want to control women
[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:03.520]  And so I've looked at the polls she's number two number three and number four out of more than 10 candidates
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:06.800]  And they know if she gets up on stage
[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:13.040]  Toronto will be charmed by her and she'll win. So what does the left do in this climate of total censorship?
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:16.480]  She's number three in polls on average
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:21.520]  They've got what five other candidates up there on stage who are, you know
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:25.120]  So boring and make you want to commit suicide
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:30.960]  I don't want to commit suicide. That's a joke. It's a eternal phrase. They'll probably kill me today and say I want to commit suicide
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:32.800]  No, I never commit suicide
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:35.920]  And they drag her off and manhandle her the police do
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:43.360]  And of course it totally backfired, but I love how they try to suppress this they got five other candidates up there
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:46.240]  She's in second or third place ping on the pole
[02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:51.840]  And
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:53.760]  I just it's incredible
[02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:58.480]  So go ahead bullies. You try to censor. I'm sure twitter will ban her probably today and unison
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:02.640]  It's not gonna work all over the world. They're trying to block this and I want women in congress
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:05.360]  I don't care what color they are. I don't care how good-looking they are
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:08.400]  I care about their brain and they stand for freedom, but
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:13.600]  She's sexy. Okay. The fact that she's good-looking and into liberty and has courage
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:16.400]  I mean, I'm married, you know
[02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:18.560]  And I love my wife. She's sexy and smart, too
[02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:22.480]  But I mean this is got my alarm bells going on for pretty bad. I want to get around the show
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:25.120]  I knew who she was in fact I won her on before but we're gonna get around
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:27.360]  But this has blown up in their face
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:30.160]  This is so beautiful. I mean this
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:33.440]  This is what it's when they censor you just use it against them
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:38.480]  Uh, here is the clip the stories by Don Salazar. It's up on info wars.com get it out to everybody
[02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:42.000]  Toronto police drag pro-trump mayoral candidate off the debate stage
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:48.080]  Despite the fact that she's a number three in major polls and despite the fact that they had thousands and thousands five thousand plus
[02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:50.480]  Sign a petition for her to be there. Here it is
[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:52.480]  Let's say
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.440]  Communists
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:14.480]  And let's just say they're completely threatened by her
[02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:20.160]  They're completely threatened because she's smart. She's sexy everything. Let's play the full clip
[02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:22.160]  That does when she first walks up
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:27.200]  She says oh, I must have missed my invitation. She's so gentlemanly ladylike
[02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:28.640]  They don't care
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:31.520]  So I want to play from the very beginning with the text and everything guys
[02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:34.800]  Because it's it's it's got some key points. Here it is
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.680]  There's supposed to be enough hormones in the water that you don't look like that
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:53.520]  We're not supposed to see women look like women anymore. Get that goddess out of here. We own that now get her out of here
[02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:02.080]  We don't want her strutting around up there with all her star appeal
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:10.480]  Get that winner off the stage if you let that horse run she'll win god. She's a winner. Good lord
[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:15.680]  You know she was a leftist they'd have her up there. She couldn't even talk with those legs
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:25.600]  And then and the police just manhandler up
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:32.800]  Yes, sir, yes, sir happy birthday, mr. President
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  Gotta love it. Yeah, I know and that's why I was presenting a petition with 5000 signatures, sir
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:53.440]  And so the cops like everybody that runs gets to be up there
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:57.200]  She's like I did run. I'm number three in the polls. He's like what?
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:02.880]  So there you go
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:04.880]  She'd be the mayor of Toronto
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:09.680]  It kicked off a sensation all across the western world of hot libertarian checks running for office
[02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:13.760]  Can't let that happen. So what a little globalist tyrants do
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:17.920]  What are the little little push-ins do with a little?
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:22.960]  Morlocks do they say no Eloi are allowed to run
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:26.160]  So again, I love the fact
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:30.480]  Yeah, I want to roll it from the beginning the full video with the text all of it
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:33.120]  three is going to be the charm let that full
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:36.720]  Video it and I can't tweet it because I'm banned on twitter
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:43.520]  But maybe I'll get Paul Watson tweeted it's in a Don Salazar's article Toronto police drag pro trump mayoral candidate off the stage. Here it is
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:47.520]  This morning
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:50.400]  Arts vote held a public debate for mayor of Toronto
[02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:54.560]  Faith gold is currently in third highest polling candidate for Ronald mayor
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:57.920]  So why was she not
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:02.800]  Invited to the debate. Good morning. Sorry. I must have missed my invitation mail. My name is Faith Goldie
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:12.720]  To the wolf whistle they say it's right so I'm gonna do it
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:14.720]  I
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:22.320]  Nothing sexier than a rebel and by the way, she could be four and a half feet tall and weigh 200 pounds. I still love
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000]  That's leprechaun bait right there
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:31.760]  I love it a woman standing up against tyranny
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:36.880]  And she's already she'd be the winner. She's already third place god. They're so scared of her
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:43.200]  But they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you will not have her
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:48.480]  Here's the thing
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:54.240]  We can beat these people and we're just gonna get more involved and more engaged and even if she doesn't win this round
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:59.440]  She'll win the next round. This is amazing. You see the cop there asking her for the phone number
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.440]  Who can blame him?
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:02.720]  All right
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:08.240]  I'm gonna come back and open the phones up and get into a bunch of the news we haven't hit yet info wars.com news wars.com remember
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:12.480]  We're the most banned transmission in the world for a reason
[02:27:14.960 --> 02:27:16.960]  Because we've got the globalist number by the way
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:19.280]  Steve boss
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:22.880]  We used to air thank god for the renegades all the time and I haven't aired it in years
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:25.760]  Can we download the whole thank god for the renegades?
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:28.000]  because
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.560]  I actually saw the george washington t-shirt
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:35.200]  That was designed for us by a highly decorated navy seal who was a
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:39.760]  Major leader in the navy seals and the most elite silt team. I'm not gonna say who made it
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:42.240]  They designed this shirt for us
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:47.280]  We've had it for like a month and I hadn't seen someone wearing it and I saw someone wearing it
[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:52.000]  It does not do justice what's at info wars.com the info wars. George Washington shirt
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:55.120]  Did you forget George Washington was like in four wars?
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:28:00.160]  At the time he was like 16 years old before he beat the british. So this is him in his uh,
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:07.200]  Colonial militia uniform with a hatchet and a musket and from the historical annals. That's what it was like a killing machine
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:11.440]  Very gentlemanly person, but a killing machine. They're very lucky too. They said like
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.080]  Dozens and dozens of battles. Nobody can shoot him. You have holes all through his clothes. You name it
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:20.000]  George Washington the original patriot t-shirt is badass
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:23.040]  Got a little colonial flag on the back of tiny info wars

[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:16.160]  When it comes to
[02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:18.160]  Renegades
[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:29.120]  These dishonorable people give us the crown of renegade they cast it down they go on it
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:34.640]  They railed against the crown another red tag man
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:39.440]  Declaring independence
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:42.880]  They laid their bodies down

[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:17.680]  Without the renegades
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:29.760]  Renegades are mine like donald trump and matt drudge

[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:37.360]  This is to all the renegades
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:40.240]  Where are the renegades in the world today?
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:42.880]  Who are the renegades?
[02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:46.080]  Remember playing this 20 years ago saying who are you?
[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:49.760]  We'll defeat the gloves. We'll return the republic. We're almost there. See?
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:52.800]  The seeds
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:54.800]  Where are they?
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:00.800]  It's so blind they don't know
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:03.760]  That we ask for this we want this
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:07.040]  If I have to give my life for this I am honored
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:10.160]  I'm ready
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:15.040]  They take that as suicidal or fatal. No, I'm so alive
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  That don't even fear death
[02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:26.800]  Renegades are mine
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:32.080]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine
[02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  Renegades
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:38.720]  heretics
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:40.960]  Enemies of the corrupt Babylonian system
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:45.600]  Steve boss powerful
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:48.800]  All right, I'm gonna go to your phone calls now
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:56.960]  You know, we can talk about the good news because we can turn things around but the truth is we're pretty far down the rat hole right now
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:59.680]  But spirit is what drives flush
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:03.360]  And studies actually show this
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:08.720]  And what I'm about to tell you then go your calls is another key of destiny
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:11.040]  And that's what the enemy hates this broadcast
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:18.240]  And you know that so I don't just say this is a key to destiny. This is a key of destiny
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:28.240]  There are many keys to destiny. I don't write a book called the keys of destiny had dreams about that but the point is
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:31.600]  They've shown in so many studies. It'll make your head spin that
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:35.600]  Countervailing if you have will and you have soul and if you
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:41.280]  Are infertile and you haven't had your ovaries cut out. You can still have kids if you focus on it and really try
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:44.640]  In many cases that your will affects it
[02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:50.880]  Because your will reaches out to God and to the universe and it makes things happen
[02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:56.400]  It's not like you just delusionally think you can build whatever that happens like Oprah says you have to have the basics
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:58.960]  But then you can do it, but it has to be for good as well
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:03.760]  Or it can be for evil, but we don't even look at those areas. It's called black magic
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:06.960]  But
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:10.880]  All the research shows
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:18.320]  That what we believe and what we stand for helps manifest or made the image of God little g
[02:38:21.520 --> 02:38:23.120]  And so that's why they try to dumb us down
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:27.760]  It's why they try to demoralize us. It's why they try to attack us. It's why they try to tell us we're pathetic
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:31.280]  And we're no good and the best plan for the world is a posthumous future
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:35.680]  Is because
[02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:43.200]  Yes, our fertility is dropped 50% yes, the sperm are down 85 to 96% depending on the study in every western country
[02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:51.360]  And yes, we know what's causing it the electromagnetic radiation from the cell phones the glyphosates are the two big causal effects in the in the main research
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:55.760]  But they've also got studies
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:04.160]  That if you're passionately in love and if you start eating organic and if you even get away from this stuff for even a month or two
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:07.040]  Your body can bounce back and that's a metaphor
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:13.760]  For they may get us down to where no flesh is spared and we're all sterile, which is the globalist plan
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:19.680]  In the satanic program the destruction of humanity is the ticket or their key
[02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:21.680]  to this
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:24.320]  thing they've been promised by this
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:26.640]  entity
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:32.800]  Over the space time continuum manipulating them and they they try all day the big tech heads the big globalists the the royalty just to
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:37.680]  Get these big rooms and all just an interface with this stuff and try to get the messages
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:40.480]  Which is all falling
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:44.400]  God's not going to give you messages about taking over but just about the general universe
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:50.400]  But these dark entities the devil and his legions they're going to give you bad transmissions
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:56.400]  And again, even if you don't believe in that the globalists don't none of them are atheists. They are on their knees
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:01.280]  For temporal power on this planet. They have turned themselves over
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:07.840]  They do rituals of the most wicked things you can imagine to sheer their conscience and cut them off from god
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:12.400]  So they can be full holy owned vessels of the ancient fallen spirit
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:14.960]  The off-world entity known as lucifer the devil
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  this alien force
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:24.160]  This discobobulated disconnected spirit
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:30.960]  And and of course tolkin told you that's why the lord of the rings rings so true because it's this disembodied fallen angel
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:34.240]  Willing to do all these horrible things that power on this planet
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:40.880]  And it's seeking to get a body and that's what the beast is and the computers and it'll be in the computers
[02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:42.880]  Walking around
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:46.080]  It will interface it will consciously possess
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:49.280]  The devil's son is not a person
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:52.640]  There'll be the devil on earth as a person, but that's only the front
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:56.480]  It will be the devil interfacing with the computers
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:40:59.760]  The devil will possess the computers
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:03.200]  That's the plan
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:12.240]  The horror Babylon the system the false prophet rides
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:19.360]  And the antichrist a man given power to rule the earth possessed by the devil
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:26.880]  But the devil will possess the machines and the beast will be one with lucifer
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:35.680]  You know how to see the beginnings of it 2,000 years ago prophesied now the warning you think god would put us in this position and not give us a transmission
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:39.680]  And we're meant to go through this because nothing good is free
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:44.240]  You have to make the choice you're you make it past this plane of existence
[02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:50.240]  You're gonna look back on this and say my god. It's so pathetic that so many people got lost because
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:53.280]  Not everybody's meant to go to the next level
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:56.640]  Do you think your spirit that's so ancient
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:01.600]  Put into your mother's womb before you're ever conceived
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:08.560]  God do you before you're ever in your mother's womb? Do you think god likes the fact that he's gonna lose a lot of you?
[02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:11.200]  God doesn't like that
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:18.080]  But you are a new entity you are an entire universe in yourself you have choice
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:21.280]  And so god loves you so much to be free will and god cries
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:23.840]  And weeps over every child he loses
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:30.400]  My point is his us fertility rate drops to all-time lows cuts and in half since the 50s

[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:37.680]  And when we spiritually realign
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:43.200]  That can regenerate our bodies and everything else and the enemy knows that we have unlimited power
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:48.560]  But only through god and his son jesus christ and that name the enemy hates above all others
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:52.640]  Jesus christ jesus of nazareth say the name

[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:48.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:53.760]  Jefferson in Virginia. Jefferson, you're on the air. Thanks for holding
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:47:58.080]  Alex, it's an honor to talk to you. Good to talk to you, brother
[02:47:59.680 --> 02:48:04.160]  I'd like to mention that Matt Bracken and Mike Adams seem to be on the same page about what
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:09.680]  President Trump needs to do and I think we need to embrace it every day that that we're not going to get through this with half measures
[02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:13.280]  We have to declare a national emergency and for stop worrying about
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:18.480]  SCOTUS appointments and elections. They're not going to matter in the national emergency scenario
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:24.880]  Well, the Democrats are and the deep state are ignoring the laws. They say they're trying to kill the president
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:32.240]  25th amendment. They say that they're in mutiny. So that's a form of martial law by private corporate groups with the chai comms
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:38.320]  So it is illegal and so I don't like martial law. They've already put us into it. So I agree
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:42.720]  Here's the problem. Even the idea that he'd fire Rosenstein. They plunged the stock market
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:45.840]  So Trump's got to be very very careful how he moves on this
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:49.600]  I mean, I guess he could nationalize it completely and jack it up to whatever he wanted
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:51.600]  But the point is they've brought us here
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:55.280]  It's like no one wants a war but they're bringing us here. So what do we do?
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:00.000]  Well, it's a little like the knife fight in butch Cassie and the Sundance kid
[02:49:00.080 --> 02:49:04.400]  Who are you going to be the guy that's challenging butch and then butch goes around the rules?
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:09.120]  There are no rules on a knife fight, but we keep thinking there are rules and the deep state doesn't play by the rules
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:14.000]  So we keep losing. We have to undermine the swamp to drain it. We can't I understand
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:19.600]  But you get becoming the swamp by trying to you know fight it that way, but I get what you're saying is
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:24.560]  Martial law just means the laws aren't being followed. Well, they've already put us into martial law
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:29.520]  Obama signed executive orders putting us in one. Trump should rescind it. I think he should have
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:34.720]  National addresses. He hasn't done it yet and just point this out and ask us what we think and I think
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:37.840]  I think that enough
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:42.560]  Just the idea of him releasing classified documents showing what traders they are has already made them crap their britches, but
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:45.280]  I'm very judicious about this
[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:49.440]  But I more and more the point is it's not radical to say
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:51.760]  Trump should arrest all these people and have martial law
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:58.480]  Selectively because they already did it. They're already rogue. They're already. So yes, that is now legitimate if he does it
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:01.680]  I don't know. It's the best move and and that's a gut level
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:07.440]  I think the best move is having a discussion about it to show these people in the power structure where they've brought us
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:13.600]  We we can talk all day they're they're never they're always going to double down on threatening
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:17.200]  Crashing the stock market and things of that nature, but that's actually an opportunity
[02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:21.280]  I think to fix things if they if they go that route we can get rid of the
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:24.800]  Federal Reserve Act we can get rid of the Federal Reserve controlled by Europe
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:28.640]  But here's the old don't you know, Trump's already talked about this a year and a half ago. Here's the issue
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:34.880]  Bringing the economy back as first and foremost defeating the chai comms sucking hundreds of billions out of us is key
[02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:41.680]  Uh, the Federal Reserve is working against him. I cannot disagree with you and it makes me sick that we've now reached this point
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:44.320]  I just don't know
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:49.200]  The president's going to have to lead it from the front if he gives a state of the emergency state of the union
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:53.040]  To the people and says all this I will back the president
[02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:58.720]  As long as there's court trials for the people once they're arrested and as long as he can be able to round them up within a month
[02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:00.800]  But yes, I think a civil emergency
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:04.000]  CNN msnbc all work for globalists for sorrows
[02:51:04.560 --> 02:51:08.800]  Uh, and if the u.s. Military went and took those over I mean, I think that's the right response at this level
[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:11.440]  They're trying to open up the country. They're openly say they're going to kill the president
[02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:13.120]  They openly say they're going to shut down free press
[02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:18.320]  I think if he sees the the tech giants and all the rest of them were in link with your control after 30 day emergency
[02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:24.560]  Um, it's just a very dangerous place, but I think we're going there. I appreciate your call. I think we're I think we're already going there, brother
[02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:27.600]  I mean, they're the ones saying 25th amendment martial law
[02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:31.920]  We're not going to let deep state do this. So and I know trump isn't either which is a
[02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:35.680]  But you got to imagine people like phil mud and muller
[02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:38.320]  They've had decades of doing whatever they want criminally
[02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:42.560]  So they just think they're invincible and they don't get there's a new sheriff in town
[02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:48.160]  Like we are committed and I got to say 90% of the military is on trump's side
[02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:51.200]  the public's on trump's side, so
[02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:56.400]  We have to explain though. They brought us to martial law. They brought us to mutiny. They brought us to civil war
[02:51:56.640 --> 02:52:01.360]  So if we can't fix it and the government is saying no to the president outside of things, they're rogue
[02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:06.000]  So it is a civil emergency. We're already in one and I I
[02:52:07.280 --> 02:52:09.920]  I don't think the president knows what to do right now. I'm gonna leave it to him
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:12.720]  I am not gonna sit here and call for
[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:18.160]  This and and it's not because I'm afraid to say it
[02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:21.520]  I had Mike Adams article. I said it should be entertained
[02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:27.120]  Because that's where they've taken us, but I don't think we are metaphysically at that point right now
[02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:29.280]  And I think it's up to the president the commander-in-chief
[02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:33.760]  To decide those points and I think it's very frightening that we've reached this point
[02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:37.920]  But I'm not gonna lie to you that this is on the table had a lot of people call me and stuff and say my god
[02:52:37.920 --> 02:52:42.160]  This is crazy. What are you talking about? I said they've already done it. You mean to show you where they've done it
[02:52:42.880 --> 02:52:47.920]  What do you do to a belligerent group of criminals on the chai-com pit doing this? I mean, that's where we are
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:53.760]  Nobody wanted to fight hitler in 1940, but the son of a bitch kept doing all this crap
[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:56.880]  You know, you get to a point where you don't like it, but you got to do it
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:02.560]  I want to warn the left with fantasies of violence and all this stuff
[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:08.560]  Sure, let me tell you something. I've looked at every possible angle down this road. Every one of them is particularly bad for you
[02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:11.680]  And I don't have any wish to hurt leftist
[02:53:13.120 --> 02:53:18.960]  I don't need that existential victory over you to feel big. I'm just saying stop now warning warning
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:21.280]  You need to stop right now
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000]  I'm because once the gloves are off man
[02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:25.920]  I mean
[02:53:25.920 --> 02:53:30.560]  Once the veneer pills back and we grow our things man, you're gonna. I mean, it's not gonna be pretty
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:34.880]  You people that are fighting us want to dominate us because we have the spirit in the will
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:39.280]  Do you understand that we can be a thousand times more vicious than you ever imagined?
[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:46.560]  The Christians and the patriots and the conservatives are killing machines
[02:53:48.160 --> 02:53:53.120]  That's why we're so restrained you are really letting the genie out of the bottle and I feel sorry for you
[02:53:53.120 --> 02:53:59.520]  because
[02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:06.640]  There's not gonna be a rock you're gonna be able to hide under this isn't gonna be like past wars
[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:18.720]  Clock's ticking judgment day. Oh, I got so many great calls here
[02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:22.880]  Ryan in Kentucky Ryan. Thanks for holding her on the air
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:28.240]  How you doing Alex? I'm doing pretty good brother. How are you doing?
[02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:31.360]  Good man. Appreciate you guys having me on
[02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:36.720]  I want to talk to you about this PayPal scandal. What's what's your brother game playing here? You got people
[02:54:37.440 --> 02:54:41.840]  Um over overtaken all these other banks and it's a big monopoly. Oh, yeah
[02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:46.480]  PayPal's already bought almost all the other pay payment processors and they're trying to shut us down right now
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:52.080]  I mean, so what am I supposed to do? It just shows the the Nazis wouldn't let Jews buy or sell
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:56.640]  So this is the first thing they do when the Bolsheviks took over in 1917
[02:54:56.960 --> 02:55:00.400]  First thing they did was kill banking take over the trains and the telephones
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:03.520]  So it's here. So what do we do? I don't know. What do we do?
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:09.520]  And so so you've got all these articles coming out by by the amazon stock. It's skyrocketing
[02:55:09.600 --> 02:55:15.360]  So it's just a game plan to get them there. What are you doing for the people that are releasing all these articles about you statement?
[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:20.080]  Oh, typical info wars typical Alex Jones buy my stuff now because you can't in the future
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:23.120]  How do we go about getting it? What do you have to say to those people?
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:28.320]  Well, I mean look the jeff bezos can sell all the vitamins in the world and then I sell him a bad guy
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:32.560]  So they're always going to go. Oh, look, he funds himself. How dirty. Oh my god. That's bad
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:36.240]  I mean, it's just it none of it. No one even reads it. No one even buys it
[02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:41.520]  It's the corporates believing they have a cover for what they're doing. So they see all the propaganda and they go
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:46.240]  Oh, people are buying it. It's having the opposite effect. I mean it shows what they want to do to you
[02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:48.720]  It shows how they want to shut all of you down from commerce
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:51.680]  And they believe because they're a bunch of followers that if they intimidate you
[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:54.640]  By by hurting me that that'll make you get in line
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:56:00.240]  I'm betting on you and think it just makes you mad and by the way people have been really supporting us
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:02.480]  We were shadow banned for over a year
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:04.640]  Having trouble raising money
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:09.760]  Because we were still trying to focus on their platforms now that we're focusing on info wars.com and news wars.com
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:14.160]  We're doing pretty darn good. Now a big winner could come and they got a lot of dirty tricks
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:18.320]  We need more support now than ever, but all I've got is the truth. I mean, I can just sit here and tell you right now
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:22.480]  I appreciate everybody's support and people should get x2. They should get super mail mentality
[02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:26.160]  It's the final batch of that 40% off brain force amazing to tropic
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:30.960]  and just sign up for auto ship and you know, the fact is they're going to go after all the other payment processors, but
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:34.560]  Uh, there's a big stuff about to happen with executive orders
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:39.600]  And I can tell you that and there's big stuff happening on the law front in the next 48 hours
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:43.040]  So look for that. So they're really forcing their hand
[02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:46.720]  Uh, I know the white house and congress is very concerned about this
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:50.320]  The nra is very concerned about this because they already tried that it's on the nra
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:55.280]  Uh, and so all I can say is my friend just keep spreading the articles in the videos
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:57:02.640]  Because the number one thing they want is to not have you 42 days out from the election spreading info wars.com and news wars.com articles
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:07.040]  So you've got to get more specific on these people state-to-state who are going to be going in for this midterm
[02:57:07.040 --> 02:57:11.440]  Because it's going to mean a lot to a lot of people. Well, you say get specific. It's specific about what?
[02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:19.440]  Okay, most average Joe's don't get in and and and find their facts big dig their facts for state-to-state
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:26.480]  Reps and vote so and it's not right to expect them to go blindly vote republican down the board
[02:57:26.960 --> 02:57:30.640]  Hammer these people why you can't because I'm telling you next they're going to come after your domain
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:36.880]  Well, sure. Look, I'm not worried about me. Tell me I keep trying to put that message out. I'll be here as long as God wants me to be here
[02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:43.520]  People know the establishment doesn't want trump in and they don't want republicans in and they want blue bloods in that

[03:00:08.240 --> 03:00:12.080]  Coming to you live from austin texas
[03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:21.040]  This entire high tech spy grid of ai being built is lucifer who cannot approach omnipresence
[03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:24.000]  Attempt to create an artificial omnipresence
[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:30.320]  But really it's not an omnipresence. It's a control grid to make you follow the orders they give
[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:35.040]  So that they can have an omnipresence of falsehood with no free will
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:37.040]  Because there is no omnipresence
[03:00:37.600 --> 03:00:42.960]  With free will god has created separate universes show that he would no longer be omnipresent
[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:48.640]  He still has the omnipresence, but chooses to wall it off by releasing the free will
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:52.720]  That's a complex system that you can figure it out. I'm sure
[03:00:53.200 --> 03:00:56.320]  We're taking phone calls paul watch is coming up the next segment. He's loaded for bear
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:01:03.040]  He's got the former leech singer of the misfits on who's been banned from big festival in england for daring to promote info wars.com
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:09.040]  Right now, let's go to bethany and pa than judy in florida bethany and pa. Thank you for holding so much today
[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:12.480]  Hey Alex John. Sorry. I am peachy king
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:20.560]  Um, just want to plug your bodies real quick if I could. Um, it is the best anti-inflammatory pain reliever
[03:01:20.560 --> 03:01:25.680]  I have ever taken. Um, I was in a car accident five years ago had severe neck pain
[03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:30.560]  Was taking over the counter medicine had doctors prescribed things to me nothing worked except for this
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:33.920]  I still have a little tinges of pain, but I have never had such
[03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:39.520]  I've never felt like this before my accident. So thank you so much for your quality products. Well, no, thank you. Listen
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:41.440]  turmeric
[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:47.040]  And when it's concentrated hundreds of times stronger than it normally is in the root form from india
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:50.560]  Is a known anti-inflammatory. That's what I'm saying is
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:54.640]  turmeric, especially bodies is 95 percent of humanoid the strongest out there
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:57.920]  It works better for me with a pen in my leg and a torn Achilles and
[03:01:57.920 --> 03:01:59.920]  All sorts of injuries
[03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:04.320]  It works better for me and for my wife who has a hip that hurts from tennis and an elbow
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:09.360]  Than Advil and I'm not comparing it to Advil. I'm just saying yes. It's amazing. What happened when you took bodies?
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:14.480]  Um, it's it's you know, you're uh, it's natural and stuff
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:19.440]  It took uh, it took about a week and a half for me to actually start to feel the pressure in my neck start to
[03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:25.440]  Just basically release and go away. I'm able to by the way, that's key. It's not like Advil. It hits in three hours exactly
[03:02:25.440 --> 03:02:29.680]  It's a natural anti-inflammatory. So it takes about a week generally for it to really kick in
[03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:36.320]  Yeah, I had um limited I had limited head movement. I couldn't really turn my head all the way to the left my shoulder
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:41.920]  I'm now able to move my head from side to side without having this intense pain that I had from the accident
[03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:48.160]  Um, it's just it's really it's been a miracle honestly for me. Well, it's the power what god gave us your mother nature
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:50.560]  Uh, bethany, what else is on your mind today?
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:57.760]  Um, just wanted to talk about the censorship that you guys are under. Um, it's I mean, you obviously know, it's backfiring in a safe
[03:02:57.760 --> 03:03:01.280]  State time off. I mean, I have had three of your stickers. Um,
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:08.240]  Right on the back of my car plastered for everybody to see for three years. I've had absolutely no reactions until you were banned
[03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:13.600]  Simultaneously from facebook, youtube, all of that. I have had such
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:20.640]  Hospitality towards me from the people in my community now that they know what infowars is because of the false
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:26.080]  Narratives that they're giving on the mainstream news. I have had um people giving me dirty looks
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:32.960]  Flipping me off cutting me off in the road. I actually had somebody road rage against me because they saw my bumper stickers
[03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:36.960]  They rolled down their window and started yelling at me about how I'm a racist
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:41.520]  How I'm frivolous because I'm white how wish that's the first time I've ever seen a person like me
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:48.240]  Because I'm white how wish that's the first thing from it and again infowars has been like trump a new target
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:53.440]  So you're you're getting what the left's thinking so they're manifesting on you what they're already thinking
[03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:57.120]  So they see infowars as a trigger and that shows the type of bizarre
[03:03:57.680 --> 03:03:59.680]  race spading brainwashing
[03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:02.720]  That they have engineered into their own people very very sad
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:10.480]  Exactly and it's it's even worse that is they think that because they are yelling at me and screaming at me and all these profanities
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:12.800]  They think that I'm going to do with you know
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:18.240]  The right what they say does that I'm going to start fighting with them back and that's the opposite of what I do
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:23.360]  I actually super encourage them to talk to me instead of screaming. Why are you upset? Why do you just breathe?
[03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:25.360]  And what do they do once you do that?
[03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:27.840]  They scream louder because they don't have an answer
[03:04:28.240 --> 03:04:34.800]  They're just mad at infowars because of the truth and they are sticking their head in the sand like a bunch of ostriches
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:39.040]  Well, they're seeing you as one dimensional as a person and it's their time to be hateful
[03:04:39.040 --> 03:04:44.800]  It's their time to be a bit. You're a bad person because the media said you were a nazi when they're funded by George Soros
[03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:48.720]  The nazi collaborator Bethany great points. God bless you. Thanks for the support
[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:53.040]  We'll be back with more calls and Paul Joseph Watson from her virginic magesies london
[03:04:54.240 --> 03:04:58.240]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now
[03:04:59.440 --> 03:05:01.920]  Infowars is being openly targeted at the democratic party
[03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:04.960]  Leftist CIA operatives the corrupt justice department
[03:05:04.960 --> 03:05:09.520]  And the entire Soros crime syndicate people say why would you start a fight with them?
[03:05:10.080 --> 03:05:15.600]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future. We didn't do this
[03:05:16.160 --> 03:05:18.160]  So we've already had incredible success
[03:05:18.480 --> 03:05:25.520]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target
[03:05:25.920 --> 03:05:31.280]  And if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos infowars.com
[03:05:31.280 --> 03:05:36.240]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win
[03:05:36.960 --> 03:05:39.360]  We have huge sales infowars store.com right now
[03:05:39.840 --> 03:05:43.040]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you
[03:05:43.280 --> 03:05:46.640]  Despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market
[03:05:46.960 --> 03:05:53.040]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially Soros the global Spain win. This is infowars darkest hour. We your support
[03:05:53.120 --> 03:05:55.120]  I'm counting on you

[03:06:40.240 --> 03:06:43.840]  I but that's the problem having 20 phone lines. We get 10 callers on we can't get the rest
[03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:48.080]  So but this is the fourth hour paul joseph watson. Please don't forget tomorrow

[03:08:08.960 --> 03:08:12.560]  They they've already done so much. It makes me fight them harder

[03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:06.560]  George Soros is bought a controlling interest of it a month ago people said a lot of you tech Soros for buying it
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:11.920]  I didn't know to look it up. I said, I bet Soros is involved. Oh, Soros bought PayPal a month ago. Okay. Now I see
[03:09:12.640 --> 03:09:15.840]  Oh, Soros bought into Facebook. He bought into Twitter boom. It happens
[03:09:16.960 --> 03:09:20.960]  There are other payment processors. They'll go after those it look at the point is I expect to be attacked
[03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:25.440]  Okay, I don't want to be out in the street and have some left to shoot me or whatever
[03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:29.920]  But if that happens, it's I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. I'm where I need to be
[03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:34.240]  And so I think we're gonna win. So sorry to the collars Lauren George Gerald
[03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:38.080]  Nicole Gator Lindsey Judy Schuyler Nelson Danny

[03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:54.800]  I'm not a Netflix show. I'm a real guy being demonized by the whole globalist system to be an example to others
[03:09:54.800 --> 03:09:56.800]  If you stand up to us, we'll destroy you
[03:09:58.240 --> 03:10:02.880]  Well, you're a day late in the dollar short globalist. We already rebooted the world
[03:10:02.880 --> 03:10:09.600]  We already rebooted America rebooted nationalism exposed globalism. And so everything else happens to me is gravy. I don't want to die
[03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:12.240]  But
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:15.040]  I've already fulfilled my purpose. I tend to keep going on and on and on
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:17.760]  And I'm sure that's in God's plan. I certainly hope
[03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:22.400]  Uh, so pray for us spread the articles spread the videos financial support is a great product

[03:10:27.760 --> 03:10:32.320]  we got 50 minutes left in this transmission then the war room with Owen shroyer and
[03:10:32.960 --> 03:10:38.960]  Roger stone others coming up spread those live links and fours.com fours last show and now Paul Joseph Watson
[03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:43.600]  Thanks Alex. Yeah, we've got a new story breaking at this hour
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:47.040]  Which has the potential to be the funniest story of the entire year
[03:10:47.760 --> 03:10:52.480]  Creepy porn lawyer Michael eventy who of course is a lawyer for stormy Daniels
[03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:56.960]  He basically came out with some claims a couple of days ago that there was a third
[03:10:57.520 --> 03:11:03.440]  Cavanaugh accuser. He said he was 100. She said he said she was 100% credible
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.560]  Those were his words 100% credible
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:15.440]  Along with that came these salacious tales of alcohol fueled gang rape sessions that cavanaugh the virgin apparently engaged in
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.240]  During his younger days. Well now
[03:11:18.240 --> 03:11:24.480]  Well now mysteriously just as of today Michael eventy locks account after admitting
[03:11:25.040 --> 03:11:27.040]  Cavanaugh accuser might not come forward
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:29.840]  Now if these rumors flying around twitter are true
[03:11:30.560 --> 03:11:34.320]  And again, it's unconfirmed, but this is very much front and center of twitter right now
[03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:39.520]  It appears that creepy porn lawyer Michael eventy may have been trolled
[03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:47.280]  By a member of 4chan posing as a cavanaugh victim claiming that these gang rape gang rapes had happened
[03:11:47.280 --> 03:11:50.240]  And it was all complete nonsense
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:55.840]  Again, this is unconfirmed as of this hour, but he's locked down his twitter account
[03:11:56.480 --> 03:12:02.960]  There's a headline out of bright bar attorney Michael eventy said his client might now not come forward against Brett cavanaugh
[03:12:03.440 --> 03:12:06.160]  And then locked his twitter public profile from view
[03:12:06.800 --> 03:12:11.520]  Why might she not come forward? Well, if you go on my twitter profile, I retweeted a
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:14.080]  post from somebody who said
[03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:17.680]  Quote it's because he was embarrassed by a 4chan prank
[03:12:18.240 --> 03:12:24.000]  The woman who had him blaring about a new cavanaugh accuser and rape gangs was the girlfriend of a 4chan guy
[03:12:24.400 --> 03:12:29.680]  When she went dark, he realized his big reveal was a hoax and he was gonna look like a punk
[03:12:30.800 --> 03:12:34.560]  It could actually be the case that this mysterious third accuser
[03:12:34.880 --> 03:12:39.760]  Who came forward with all these salacious tales of alcohol fuel gang rape sessions
[03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:47.200]  Is completely made up out of thin air and let me add this paul. We have jimmy kimmel saying cut cavanaugh's wee-wee off
[03:12:47.920 --> 03:12:51.680]  These are the same folks, you know that called trump putin's, you know what holster
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:55.280]  I mean, if we were doing this, we would be arrested. Here's the club of kimmel
[03:12:56.480 --> 03:12:58.960]  Cavanaugh gets confirmed to the supreme court
[03:12:59.760 --> 03:13:03.440]  Okay, well in return we get to cut that pesky penis of his off
[03:13:05.520 --> 03:13:07.520]  No, that's not good
[03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:13.520]  I thought I had a solution there for a minute. Paul Watson go ahead and take over
[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:18.960]  Yeah, so now the third accuser appears to be a 4chan troll remains to be confirmed
[03:13:18.960 --> 03:13:20.560]  But that could be the case
[03:13:20.560 --> 03:13:23.040]  Of course, we have the second accuser debba remearest
[03:13:23.520 --> 03:13:26.960]  Who claims that cavanaugh pulled out his manhood during a drinking game?
[03:13:27.360 --> 03:13:32.320]  She admits she has significant gaps in her memories just as ford the original accuser does
[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:40.240]  Her best friend who was supposedly there and supposedly witnessed this she claims said she's caught never heard of the incident in question
[03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:45.440]  remearest gave the new yorker six names who apparently would confirm the story
[03:13:45.840 --> 03:13:47.840]  All of them said it never happened
[03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:51.360]  Even the new york times no fan of trump or cavanaugh
[03:13:51.840 --> 03:13:55.040]  Couldn't find anyone to corroborate. Paul. That's my question
[03:13:55.280 --> 03:14:00.480]  Why did all both these women give five six names a piece people go? This is total horse crap
[03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:04.480]  We were never even at a party with her. Why did they do that? It's it's weird
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:09.680]  Because they just don't care they think there's not as long as they can derail it and delay it
[03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:16.400]  Until after the midterms or you know pressure trump to get somebody else nominated that they can buy enough time
[03:14:16.640 --> 03:14:20.560]  And then potentially win the senate and get their own candidate in after 2020
[03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:24.240]  Anything goes at this point alex anything whatsoever
[03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:29.440]  None of this stacks up whatsoever. You've got the the first accuser ford
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:37.120]  Waiting 36 years to report this. She didn't report. It's a law enforcement. She reports it to politicians
[03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:43.280]  Oh, but it's not political. Is it alex then we have her saying by the way, you raped me 36 years ago, paul
[03:14:45.360 --> 03:14:49.520]  Now, yeah, you it's credible. You have to step down from from public life
[03:14:49.760 --> 03:14:54.720]  Just like they say guilty into proven innocent even though you're not 36 years old. How are you? How are you 35?
[03:14:55.440 --> 03:14:56.720]  36
[03:14:56.720 --> 03:14:59.520]  So at birth you rape me?
[03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:05.520]  Three months old it happened, you know potentially you've got witnesses. I mean it could have I do hold on
[03:15:05.520 --> 03:15:11.360]  There's one yes, hold on it. I'm just there paul. You're a rapist. How dare you rape me
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:19.440]  Don't question accusers don't question the abuse don't question victims. I want you off air admit it admit you're sorry for raping me
[03:15:20.640 --> 03:15:25.520]  Well, believe the victim alex believe the victim every woman has the right to be believed unless you
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:27.520]  Identify as a woman
[03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:33.920]  Yeah, unless you're assaulted by alfrank and unless you're groped by cori book unless you're physically abused by keith ellison
[03:15:34.480 --> 03:15:38.880]  And it's you raped me at three months old. I want you in jail
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:41.920]  Say you're sorry for raping me
[03:15:42.160 --> 03:15:47.040]  I uh deeply humbly apologize. That's more like it. You don't question victims. Damn it

[03:19:59.360 --> 03:20:05.360]  So
[03:20:10.320 --> 03:20:18.960]  News analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph watson
[03:20:20.480 --> 03:20:26.080]  In the next segment we have michael graves the former misfits punk rock singer
[03:20:26.080 --> 03:20:31.440]  We were pronouncing his name wrong because of the way of spell bits michael graves coming on to talk about why he was
[03:20:32.080 --> 03:20:39.280]  Banned basically by a music festival despite having sold out shows because he dared support free speech and retweeted yours truly
[03:20:39.360 --> 03:20:41.520]  and alex jones that's coming up in the next segment
[03:20:42.160 --> 03:20:43.440]  for the moment
[03:20:43.440 --> 03:20:46.480]  twitter is ablaze with speculation about whether or not
[03:20:47.200 --> 03:20:50.720]  4chan trolled creepy porn lawyer michael eventy
[03:20:50.720 --> 03:20:59.040]  Into um putting forward this accuser this third accuser of um the uh, the uh, the uh, supreme court nominee cabineau
[03:20:59.680 --> 03:21:04.960]  You know, he came out these um lured tales of gang rape alcohol-fueled sex parties
[03:21:05.440 --> 03:21:10.320]  It turns out that it may have been a 4chan troll all along again. This is not confirmed
[03:21:10.960 --> 03:21:15.040]  Chris baron just commented on this on twitter. I just retweeted him
[03:21:15.040 --> 03:21:21.440]  Uh pro-trump conservative strategist. He says eventy can't even handle trump trolls. How do you think he'll fair against trump himself?
[03:21:21.440 --> 03:21:24.320]  What a fake tough guy a fraud and a grifter
[03:21:24.800 --> 03:21:26.800]  Perfect face for the modern left
[03:21:27.360 --> 03:21:33.200]  And he said that in response to eventy's explanation as to why he'd locked down his twitter account
[03:21:33.600 --> 03:21:37.040]  Which basically amounts to oh, they were being mean to me
[03:21:37.440 --> 03:21:40.720]  That's what michael eventy has given as his reason for locking down
[03:21:40.720 --> 03:21:48.400]  His account the speculation is actually that he locked down his account because his story about this third cabineau accuser
[03:21:48.720 --> 03:21:52.720]  Has completely collapsed and blown up in his stupid face
[03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:55.200]  If you go on my twitter account, I've just retweeted
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:00.960]  The um post on 4chan where they claim that one of their members approached
[03:22:01.360 --> 03:22:08.720]  Approached eventy creepy porn lawyer with this fake story about how cabineau was involved in these gang rape sex parties
[03:22:08.720 --> 03:22:12.720]  And it's all complete nonsense. Again, none of that is confirmed
[03:22:12.960 --> 03:22:18.640]  But that is the speculation the wild speculation that's taken a hold of twitter right now
[03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:22.720]  So we'll continue to follow it there. You see the screenshot from 4chan
[03:22:23.440 --> 03:22:26.960]  You can click on that and blow it up and read the post again. None of this is confirmed
[03:22:26.960 --> 03:22:34.960]  But if it was confirmed it will definitely qualify as the funniest story of 2018 bar none
[03:22:34.960 --> 03:22:38.400]  So we'll continue to track that for the rest of the broadcast
[03:22:39.680 --> 03:22:43.920]  Twitter has announced it's going to ban dehumanizing comments
[03:22:43.920 --> 03:22:48.320]  Oh, and this won't be abused to censor conservatives even more will it?
[03:22:48.800 --> 03:22:52.320]  Headline twitter to ban dehumanizing comments with user help
[03:22:53.280 --> 03:23:00.000]  Twitter on Tuesday reached out to users for help crafting a ban on comments that dehumanize people and set the stage for real world violence
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:02.720]  So again, this is the whole incident
[03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:07.600]  So again, this is the whole intersectional far leftist trope
[03:23:08.240 --> 03:23:12.720]  That comments and that being mean to people like being mean to CNN reporters
[03:23:13.360 --> 03:23:20.240]  Sets the stage for real world violence is abusive and is targeted harassment. It says a policy change
[03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:23.040]  That twitter has been working on for several months
[03:23:23.760 --> 03:23:30.320]  Is intended to broaden hateful content restrictions. I wonder who this is going to impact take a wild guess
[03:23:30.320 --> 03:23:37.920]  To include barring tweets dehumanizing people based on race religion sexual orientation for other social grouping
[03:23:38.320 --> 03:23:41.760]  Now it's interesting because I read some of the examples they provide
[03:23:42.560 --> 03:23:51.600]  I basically say if you compare somebody to an animal then that qualifies as abusive that qualifies as dehumanizing
[03:23:51.920 --> 03:23:53.920]  remember a few months back
[03:23:53.920 --> 03:24:00.800]  Donald Trump compared ms. 13 gang member killers people who literally blow up children
[03:24:01.440 --> 03:24:06.960]  Two animals he called them animals. The left got very upset about that. So under this new definition
[03:24:07.680 --> 03:24:13.840]  Twitter would have banned Donald Trump or at least given themselves the pretext to ban Donald Trump because he referred to
[03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:19.440]  vicious murdering thug gang member illegal aliens as animals
[03:24:19.440 --> 03:24:24.240]  I remember how who was it Pelosi and a bunch of people got really upset over that
[03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:29.840]  Being mean to vicious murdering gang members can't do that. Maybe if someone you know calls
[03:24:30.320 --> 03:24:35.200]  Jihadist terrorists a naughty word is rude to ISIS. Maybe they'll get banned as well
[03:24:35.280 --> 03:24:40.000]  Maybe they'll get a psychiatric evaluation like Marine Le Pen's getting over in France
[03:24:40.880 --> 03:24:46.000]  So it says language that makes someone less than human can have repercussions off the service
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:51.360]  Of course we can get called racist goblins troglodytes evil white people all day long
[03:24:51.680 --> 03:24:58.800]  Nothing happens to those people Sarah Jong literally spews race hate and gets verified by Twitter a few weeks later
[03:24:59.120 --> 03:25:03.680]  But god forbid you would be mean to a CNN reporter banned permanently
[03:25:04.560 --> 03:25:06.560]  So of course this is going to be abused
[03:25:06.640 --> 03:25:08.640]  Of course, it's going to increase
[03:25:08.640 --> 03:25:16.720]  Intensify and accelerate double standards on the platform. This again is just another dog whistle to censor conservatives
[03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:19.280]  Watch this space as to how they implement it
[03:25:20.240 --> 03:25:21.760]  meanwhile
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:26.480]  Buzzfeed reports Facebook has removed more than a dozen big conservative and liberal political pages
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:34.160]  Apart from when they say liberal now, it's just conservative. So light set, which is Laura Ingram's outlet
[03:25:34.160 --> 03:25:40.320]  They found that one person or one organization was running all these different Facebook pages
[03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:42.640]  And they were all promoting
[03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:51.280]  Live set.com content now live set.com is a conservative news outlet operated or owned at least by Laura Ingram
[03:25:52.160 --> 03:25:55.920]  They've banned a bunch of pages tied to that organization
[03:25:55.920 --> 03:26:00.080]  They haven't banned live set yet on Facebook, but they've banned over a dozen
[03:26:00.080 --> 03:26:05.440]  Hyper parties and pages with more than 30 million combined fans
[03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:11.760]  After discovering they were administered by the same fake account in violation of policies against spamming
[03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:15.440]  Now I've only read halfway into this article, but it basically says
[03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:21.840]  All these different pages were sending out content from live set.com, which again is a conservative news outlet
[03:26:22.080 --> 03:26:23.200]  So how they
[03:26:23.200 --> 03:26:28.080]  Strong on that into a headline about the banning liberal pages as well doesn't really make a lot of sense
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:34.560]  This appears to be targeted at a conservative news outlet primarily. So yet another example of censorship
[03:26:35.040 --> 03:26:37.280]  Meanwhile, the story we covered earlier
[03:26:38.240 --> 03:26:41.760]  Leftist group that harassed Ted Cruz vows. You are not safe. We will find you
[03:26:42.560 --> 03:26:48.000]  They have now deleted that tweet whether they were forced to delete it by Twitter or not remains to be seen
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:54.720]  They've deleted the tweet. They've deleted the other tweet where they doxed Gavin McKinnis who was on the show earlier
[03:26:54.720 --> 03:27:02.160]  But their account is still active. Twitter has not suspended this far left violence promoting doxing promoting
[03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:04.640]  targeted harassment promoting account
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:10.720]  For giving out Gavin McKinnis phone number, which led to him getting death threats and for tweeting quote
[03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:16.720]  You are not safe. We will find you. We will take from you the piece you have taken from so many others
[03:27:17.440 --> 03:27:22.880]  So again yet another example of double standards on the one out of one side of the mouth
[03:27:22.880 --> 03:27:25.120]  They're talking about banning dehumanizing language
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:32.160]  At the other side of the mouth this group has merely been forced to delete two tweets. Their account has not been suspended
[03:27:32.640 --> 03:27:34.640]  Double standards in evidence once again
[03:27:35.440 --> 03:27:41.600]  The founder of the group that harassed Ted Cruz the Antifa professor who we were talking about before as well
[03:27:42.240 --> 03:27:47.680]  Has like creepyporn lawyer Michael eventy placed his Twitter account on lockdown
[03:27:47.680 --> 03:27:53.520]  Lockdown, which of course means that nobody who doesn't follow him can report his tweets
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:27:59.920]  So the tweet from back on november 8 2016 where he literally encourages people to assassinate Mike Pence
[03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:02.560]  Those are his words quote assassinate Mike Pence
[03:28:03.280 --> 03:28:07.040]  That's disappeared temporarily. I don't know if that's because he locked down his account
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:12.960]  Or because he deleted the tweet in response to this info was article that's up on screen right now
[03:28:12.960 --> 03:28:19.520]  So if his account come comes back from lockdown then we'll see whether he's deleted those tweets or not
[03:28:19.840 --> 03:28:25.920]  But again, this is the guy who founded the group the guy who encouraged people to quote kill cops first
[03:28:26.320 --> 03:28:31.680]  The guy who encouraged people to kill your local politicians before they kill you those were his tweets
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:36.160]  He's locked down his account. Is that to avoid being suspended by twitter?
[03:28:36.400 --> 03:28:41.920]  Which probably wouldn't suspend him anyway given that his open encouragement to assassinate Mike Pence has been online
[03:28:41.920 --> 03:28:48.480]  For almost two years with no action whatsoever. Oh, but there's no discrimination against himself. It's absolutely incredible
[03:28:48.720 --> 03:28:52.560]  We'll be back with michael graves misfit singer after the break. Don't go away

[03:31:59.440 --> 03:32:01.920]  Infowars is being openly targeted by the democratic party
[03:32:02.560 --> 03:32:07.680]  Leftist CIA operatives the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate
[03:32:08.080 --> 03:32:10.080]  People say why would you start a fight with them?
[03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:15.600]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this
[03:32:15.600 --> 03:32:17.840]  So we've already had incredible success
[03:32:18.480 --> 03:32:25.520]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target
[03:32:25.920 --> 03:32:31.280]  And if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos infowars.com
[03:32:32.000 --> 03:32:36.240]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win

[03:32:53.040 --> 03:32:55.040]  I'm counting on you
[03:32:57.680 --> 03:33:00.320]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[03:33:00.320 --> 03:33:07.760]  Live from the infowars.com studios
[03:33:08.320 --> 03:33:14.320]  You're listening to the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph
[03:33:14.320 --> 03:33:16.320]  Watson
[03:33:18.320 --> 03:33:22.320]  Your back it is the fourth hour of the alex jones show. We're trying to get our guest um
[03:33:22.880 --> 03:33:27.200]  michael graves hooked up on the line to talk about how he was banned by a music festival
[03:33:27.200 --> 03:33:35.680]  Sold out shows already lined up merely for retweeting yours truly for defending alex jones for defending free speech the true intolerance
[03:33:36.400 --> 03:33:40.240]  Of progressivism showing its ugly face. Once again, we're trying to get him on the line
[03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:43.600]  Well, we're talking about the creepy porn lawyer michael eventi
[03:33:44.240 --> 03:33:48.160]  Who again claimed that he had this third accuser this third cabanar accuser?
[03:33:48.960 --> 03:33:52.560]  Turns out potentially this is not proven. This is still potential
[03:33:52.560 --> 03:33:57.280]  That he locked down his account on twitter because it turned out that he'd been pranked
[03:33:57.920 --> 03:34:04.400]  By four chan who came forward with this fake story from this fake accuser and that he got completely
[03:34:04.960 --> 03:34:08.320]  Trolled by it now the question I asked on twitter just now
[03:34:09.040 --> 03:34:12.800]  Was this if eventi was pranked by four chan?
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:19.440]  Will the media just continue to believe the story anyway as they did when four chan pranked the story?
[03:34:19.440 --> 03:34:24.640]  Anyway, as they did when four chan pranked them into believing the okay hand sign
[03:34:25.200 --> 03:34:27.760]  Was a white power symbol because as you remember
[03:34:28.320 --> 03:34:32.000]  Even the adl had to come out and say no this was invented by four chan
[03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:33.680]  This was deliberately
[03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:39.920]  Invented at a prank to try and convince the media that it was a symbol of white supremacy when in fact it was just
[03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:44.720]  A joke invented on the four chan message board, but still to this day
[03:34:44.720 --> 03:34:50.400]  They have hissy fits. They panic. They're all out of themselves with hysteria
[03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:55.280]  And concern when anyone does this okay hand symbol despite the fact that
[03:34:56.080 --> 03:34:58.800]  Oskia Cortes and everyone else has basically done it
[03:34:59.040 --> 03:35:02.960]  So will the media continue to believe this fake story about
[03:35:03.680 --> 03:35:05.680]  Cabanar allegedly being involved in gang rapes
[03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:11.200]  Even if it is proven that it's a four chan troll because they're still in
[03:35:11.200 --> 03:35:16.080]  In complete agreement, they believe that the okay hand sign is a white power symbol
[03:35:16.720 --> 03:35:19.760]  Which also began on four chan's message board
[03:35:19.760 --> 03:35:24.000]  So will they believe this story even if it's proven to be a complete hoax?
[03:35:24.480 --> 03:35:29.040]  That remains to be seen absolutely incredible situation right now
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:32.000]  now there's a headline on
[03:35:32.160 --> 03:35:39.920]  information liberation.com new york times kevin roofs pushes for automated facebook censorship because joke photo went viral
[03:35:39.920 --> 03:35:45.200]  Now, you know that the EU is basically just passed the law or they've got a final vote on it
[03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:51.600]  I believe but it looks like it's going to go through to ban memes to force social media companies and websites in general
[03:35:52.320 --> 03:35:57.680]  To install content filters. So when you upload a meme, it's automatically filtered
[03:35:58.160 --> 03:36:02.880]  Through this regulatory mechanism, which bans it before it's even allowed to be posted
[03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:09.760]  Well, now new york times tech writer kevin roofs suggests that facebook should automatically prevent fake images from being shared
[03:36:10.240 --> 03:36:15.440]  After a hilarious meme of president trump handing out a mega hat to a hurricane victim went viral
[03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:17.680]  now this image
[03:36:17.680 --> 03:36:20.320]  This meme if you look at it is patently
[03:36:20.960 --> 03:36:22.960]  false it's patently a joke
[03:36:23.520 --> 03:36:25.520]  nobody in their right mind could ever
[03:36:26.240 --> 03:36:31.600]  Feasibly believe that president trump will get on a little dingy in his full suit and tie
[03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:33.600]  In the middle of a hurricane
[03:36:34.640 --> 03:36:40.320]  And hand out mega hats to people who are stranded and at risk of death. It's obviously a joke
[03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:42.640]  It's obviously a satirical meme
[03:36:43.120 --> 03:36:44.800]  but roofs
[03:36:44.800 --> 03:36:48.800]  The new york times tech writer who seems to think he's an investigative genius
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:58.000]  Tweeted on monday a photoshop picture depicting trump rescuing people during hurricane florans has been shared 275,000 times on facebook the original
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:01.920]  Is from texas flooding in 2015. Oh my god
[03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:07.600]  He's found the original picture that made this meme like he's uncovered some dark secret here
[03:37:08.720 --> 03:37:16.240]  As the article states the picture is an obvious joke trump is there in his full suit and tie handing out mega hats to people stranded
[03:37:16.880 --> 03:37:23.200]  Uh, you know a belly button high water during a hurricane. It's obviously it's obviously hoax. It's obviously satirical meme
[03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:25.840]  nonetheless
[03:37:25.840 --> 03:37:31.760]  Ruth suggested facebook should automatically censor such fake images to prevent them going viral
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:37.280]  He said facebook already uses image hashing fingerprinting to prevent repeat uploads of
[03:37:37.680 --> 03:37:43.600]  eg revenge porn seems like it would be easy to prevent obviously fake photos from going viral
[03:37:44.560 --> 03:37:53.200]  So he's literally sounding the dog whistle for facebook to ban political memes that boost president trump even though it's a joke
[03:37:53.440 --> 03:37:54.880]  or that obviously
[03:37:54.880 --> 03:37:56.880]  satirized or insult leftists
[03:37:57.840 --> 03:38:03.440]  The article concludes perhaps facebook should appoint roots and others at the new york times as meme monitors
[03:38:03.840 --> 03:38:08.400]  And allow them exclusively to pick and choose which memes are allowed to be shared
[03:38:09.120 --> 03:38:14.560]  Now i'll tell you why they're doing this why they're trying to clamp down on memes because recently it was announced that facebook
[03:38:15.040 --> 03:38:22.560]  Would indeed start to target its fake news monitors its fact checkers against satirical memes
[03:38:22.560 --> 03:38:28.640]  Even though memes aren't supposed to be news stories. They're not supposed to be veritas. They're not supposed to be truth
[03:38:29.200 --> 03:38:30.880]  they're fun
[03:38:30.880 --> 03:38:36.800]  But because the left can't mean now they're trying to ban memes we can flash back to this article
[03:38:38.080 --> 03:38:43.040]  Infowars.com from june of this year new scientific study proves the left can't mean
[03:38:43.920 --> 03:38:49.600]  Which i wrote a huge new research study has proved that why everybody suspected all along the left can't mean
[03:38:49.600 --> 03:38:55.120]  The study undertaken by researchers at university college, london found that the most affected memes largely
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:38:59.520]  originated in two places the donald which is where this
[03:39:00.160 --> 03:39:02.160]  hurricane trump meme probably originated
[03:39:03.280 --> 03:39:08.720]  And four chance politically incorrect poll forum which looks like it also originated
[03:39:09.440 --> 03:39:13.040]  Creepyporn lawyer michael eventy's fake third cabin or accuser
[03:39:13.040 --> 03:39:20.320]  And even vice admitted in a write-up of the study that the most effectively spread memes originated on the donald or fortune
[03:39:21.440 --> 03:39:25.200]  Says the researchers studied more than 100 million images from online communities
[03:39:25.680 --> 03:39:32.000]  And found that poll fortune had the highest volume of memes while the donald was the best at getting memes spread outside its own community
[03:39:32.800 --> 03:39:40.080]  The researchers concluded that the algorithm they developed and this bearing in mind this is an algorithm developed to send some memes basically
[03:39:40.080 --> 03:39:46.880]  They developed the algorithm to identify the most effectively spread memes and it could quote be useful for social media platforms trying to automatically
[03:39:46.880 --> 03:39:54.080]  Detect hateful content or in other words, it could be used to censor viral memes that are successful in spreading right-wing narratives
[03:39:54.960 --> 03:40:01.120]  While to the naive they're just a fun way of sharing jokes or other content the power of memes has grown rapidly in recent years
[03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:07.600]  To the point where they're now seeing a hugely influential tool to amplify political narratives
[03:40:07.600 --> 03:40:14.720]  And because the left can't be because they're always petrified about offending somebody and walking on eggshells permanently
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:21.360]  They want them banned like I want everything else banned like when they lose an argument because they've lost the ability to make one
[03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:28.000]  They want people the platformed now. They want memes the platform leftist websites like the Guardian
[03:40:28.880 --> 03:40:35.280]  The most insufferable website on the planet called according to Elon Musk and the New Yorker which just came out with this new
[03:40:35.280 --> 03:40:37.280]  fake second-accuser
[03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:43.840]  Kaminar story complained bitterly before the election of Donald Trump that quote mean warfare was disrupting politics
[03:40:44.240 --> 03:40:48.880]  Political memes are the raw material of political talk rights the weeks Chuck Tyron
[03:40:48.880 --> 03:40:56.560]  They provide fodder for ongoing political conversations allowing for informal and spontaneous efforts to define the ethical moral limits of campaign speech
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:41:02.880]  So they're really but her about how Donald Trump supporters used memes to great effect during the presidential election
[03:41:02.880 --> 03:41:05.680]  To get him elected and they want to do something about it
[03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:15.360]  In a recent article for salon Deirdre Olson also wind about how the political meme has quote become the centerpiece of disinformation campaigns
[03:41:15.920 --> 03:41:17.920]  Even though it's not supposed to be
[03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:23.600]  A straight up fact it's a meme and that quote the ability of memes to communicate ideology is boundless
[03:41:24.400 --> 03:41:30.560]  If the left was good at creating and disseminating means one wonders if left wing legacy media outlets would be so good
[03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:34.960]  Left wing legacy media outlets would be so down on them. Obviously not
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:38.880]  So long as the right has the upper hand on the battlefield of meme warfare
[03:41:39.360 --> 03:41:45.680]  Their impacts on political discourse will always be demonized and presented as a forevoting sign of the vast right wing racist
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:48.000]  Russian fill in the blank conspiracy
[03:41:48.880 --> 03:41:54.800]  So again, just as they can't outline a cohesive political argument without resorting to calling their opponents racist or bigots
[03:41:54.800 --> 03:42:02.560]  Or indeed the platforming their opponents as we've seen over the past couple of months the left con meme
[03:42:03.280 --> 03:42:06.720]  So they simply want to ban memes instead. So what you're going to see
[03:42:07.680 --> 03:42:10.880]  Over the next few weeks over the next few months leading up to the midterms
[03:42:11.440 --> 03:42:17.920]  Is another contrived moral panic about how memes are fake news about how memes are misleading
[03:42:18.640 --> 03:42:21.920]  James Woods just locked out of this account on twitter
[03:42:21.920 --> 03:42:26.320]  But again posting a satirical meme. This is the war on memes
[03:42:26.400 --> 03:42:28.560]  They're going to tag them as misleading
[03:42:28.560 --> 03:42:34.320]  Tag them as fake news and use that as a contrived moral panic to ban them because once again
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:42.640]  The left con meme and it's simply so much easier for them to censor ban and deplatform their political adversaries
[03:42:42.640 --> 03:42:51.600]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones show live breaking you to info wars.com. Don't go away
[03:42:53.200 --> 03:42:56.720]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[03:42:57.120 --> 03:43:00.000]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani estates
[03:43:00.400 --> 03:43:06.240]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[03:43:06.720 --> 03:43:09.600]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[03:43:09.600 --> 03:43:14.800]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[03:43:14.880 --> 03:43:17.920]  We employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:43:18.480 --> 03:43:25.520]  Alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[03:43:26.240 --> 03:43:29.680]  Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[03:43:30.080 --> 03:43:33.280]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[03:43:33.600 --> 03:43:36.800]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[03:43:36.800 --> 03:43:42.000]  As it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[03:43:42.560 --> 03:43:47.680]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[03:43:48.240 --> 03:43:52.320]  But more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:43:53.120 --> 03:43:59.760]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from info wars.com when you spread the videos you are changing the world

[03:49:56.300 --> 03:49:58.300]  now earlier we had the story about
[03:49:59.020 --> 03:50:00.060]  a top
[03:50:00.060 --> 03:50:09.180]  Distance activist being caught on tape in a secret recording admitted that he gets quote paid by quote higher ups
[03:50:09.500 --> 03:50:15.500]  To quote so the division. This is brian krasenstein who has something like over
[03:50:16.380 --> 03:50:20.940]  550,000 followers on twitter. He's always near the top of the responses to trumps tweets
[03:50:21.260 --> 03:50:25.900]  He came out made these comments. This is an admitted video. He doesn't deny that this is him in the video
[03:50:25.980 --> 03:50:28.220]  He doesn't deny that that's what he said in the video
[03:50:28.220 --> 03:50:31.340]  Quote, of course, there are higher ups that are paying us
[03:50:31.820 --> 03:50:36.540]  Then he came out of the tweet about an hour ago saying of course we aren't paid by anyone to tweet
[03:50:36.780 --> 03:50:40.220]  Yeah, alt-right news organizations like info wars gateway pundit and troop pundit
[03:50:40.460 --> 03:50:45.180]  And others have used the video to paint an almost ominous narrative about those of us and those on the right
[03:50:45.900 --> 03:50:51.420]  So he says we're not paid to tweet yet literally out of his mouth in the video come the words
[03:50:51.820 --> 03:50:57.340]  Of course, there are higher ups that are paying us then he goes on to say to sow the division
[03:50:57.340 --> 03:51:01.420]  So if you get caught admitting it, you can't really take that back either
[03:51:01.500 --> 03:51:06.060]  It's not you in the video and like they've edited the audio. He's not denying that it's him in the video
[03:51:06.540 --> 03:51:10.860]  So now he's trying to walk it back. You can't walk it back when it's come out of your mouth
[03:51:11.580 --> 03:51:16.940]  Absolutely incredible duplicitousness by a top member of the resistance
[03:51:17.820 --> 03:51:21.900]  Now let's get into some more news here. We have a story out of pj media
[03:51:21.900 --> 03:51:27.660]  Again on this subject of hate. We've talked about this before they broadened out the definition of hate
[03:51:28.060 --> 03:51:32.620]  To basically include all conservative opinions. So any kind of vehement opposition
[03:51:32.940 --> 03:51:39.260]  For example to teaching transgenderism to young children in schools. No, you can't do that. That's hate
[03:51:39.420 --> 03:51:41.420]  That was literally one of the reasons
[03:51:41.900 --> 03:51:50.460]  PayPal gave when it banned info wars that we were promulgating hate because we opposed the teaching of transgender sex lifestyles
[03:51:50.460 --> 03:51:54.060]  To young children in schools. Now we have this headline
[03:51:54.540 --> 03:52:01.500]  EU justice commissioner says media must be regulated to prevent hate. Oh, you see how far down the rabbit hole this goes
[03:52:02.460 --> 03:52:05.180]  The shape of things to come both in europe and the united states
[03:52:05.820 --> 03:52:10.220]  Racial abuse discrimination and the bad version of nationalism whatever that is
[03:52:10.780 --> 03:52:16.540]  Again, so vague it can be expanded out to include anything promotes exclusion and hatred and they say that's on the rise
[03:52:16.540 --> 03:52:21.900]  And the media may need to be regulated to help curtail the problem. Who's going to regulate it?
[03:52:21.900 --> 03:52:26.860]  Oh, it's the EU that's literally trying to ban means right now and has passed a vote to do exactly that
[03:52:29.180 --> 03:52:34.140]  A dangerous version of nationalism is not only visible in the rising popularity and the extreme part of the law
[03:52:34.140 --> 03:52:36.140]  How evident in the political mainstream again?
[03:52:36.700 --> 03:52:38.700]  complete waffle complete nonsense
[03:52:39.180 --> 03:52:40.620]  just another
[03:52:40.620 --> 03:52:48.540]  Barzai excuse to censor to de-platform their political opposition as their Byzantine empire crumbles
[03:52:48.940 --> 03:52:53.820]  The article states in other words, if you're for little or no immigration, that's now called exclusion
[03:52:54.380 --> 03:53:00.860]  Oh, you see how this works if you find some cultures such as your own worthier than others. That's hatred. Yes
[03:53:01.260 --> 03:53:03.260]  I mean you could talk about afghanistan
[03:53:03.660 --> 03:53:07.900]  You know batch of barzi where old men get to have sex with your little boys
[03:53:07.900 --> 03:53:14.220]  That's part of their culture. You can't criticize their culture because that's exclusion. That's hatred
[03:53:14.380 --> 03:53:19.260]  You can talk about, you know, India where they poop on the streets because it's in their culture to do so
[03:53:19.420 --> 03:53:23.420]  Because there's horrible diseases and child malnutrition, but it's part of their culture
[03:53:23.660 --> 03:53:25.740]  So then you say that pooping on the streets is bad
[03:53:26.140 --> 03:53:29.420]  Then you're engaging in hatred and you will be de-platformed. You will be banned
[03:53:29.900 --> 03:53:33.900]  If you put love of your country over EU, that's dangerous nationalism
[03:53:33.900 --> 03:53:38.540]  To demonstrate just how far the social justice left despises adherence of free speech
[03:53:38.860 --> 03:53:41.660]  Which must perforce include hate speech
[03:53:42.460 --> 03:53:46.460]  Take a gander at this justification for consumer gender equality fascism
[03:53:47.180 --> 03:53:52.700]  Count the buzzwords. It says media can build the culture of dialogue or so divisions
[03:53:53.660 --> 03:53:59.900]  Even though literally leftists admit that they're getting paid for so division spread this information and encourage exclusion
[03:53:59.900 --> 03:54:05.100]  The commissioner said well the commissioner can go screw herself hands off our free speech
[03:54:05.660 --> 03:54:10.220]  The brexit debate is the best example of that. Oh, what a surprise. You want to ban break the tears?
[03:54:10.620 --> 03:54:17.100]  Politicians should show responsibility and restraint and must realize that there was become justification for some people that act on their urges and their fears
[03:54:17.420 --> 03:54:19.180]  they've literally
[03:54:19.180 --> 03:54:20.620]  in the past
[03:54:20.620 --> 03:54:24.700]  Tried to ban people tried to de-platform people tried to in one case
[03:54:24.700 --> 03:54:29.580]  I remember there was an actual charge against somebody for criticizing the EU
[03:54:30.460 --> 03:54:36.700]  They give an example the Czech politician pointed to far-right protests in Chemnitz the anti-saurus campaign in Hungary
[03:54:36.700 --> 03:54:41.500]  So now you can't criticize George Soros, even though he's behind a lot of these left-wing groups
[03:54:42.140 --> 03:54:47.500]  Or growing anti-muslim or anti-Roman rhetoric as examples when exclusion discrimination a lack of respect for minority
[03:54:47.660 --> 03:54:49.180]  So again, they
[03:54:49.180 --> 03:54:55.260]  Identify they define lack of respect for minorities as being opposed to flooding Europe
[03:54:55.580 --> 03:55:01.900]  With what Macron said eventually would be 200 million Africans if you're against that if you're against mass migration
[03:55:02.220 --> 03:55:04.220]  If you're against displacement of people
[03:55:04.300 --> 03:55:10.860]  If you're against working class mainly white communities in the uk or other european countries being displaced if you're against
[03:55:11.260 --> 03:55:15.740]  Getoization of our country where immigrants do not integrate. They don't get jobs
[03:55:15.740 --> 03:55:20.940]  They get pot and welfare if you call attention to any of that you're engaging in exclusion
[03:55:21.100 --> 03:55:23.660]  You will be banned. That's hate speech again
[03:55:24.300 --> 03:55:30.300]  Just a blasé justification for over mass censorship. We see right through it
[03:55:31.020 --> 03:55:35.740]  Meanwhile in sweden swedish populist politicians home targeted in arson attack
[03:55:36.060 --> 03:55:42.780]  So again the people that they claim are engaging in hate speech online are literally being hatefully and viciously attacked
[03:55:42.780 --> 03:55:47.980]  Physically in their own homes their own homes being set on fire, but that's tolerant
[03:55:47.980 --> 03:55:52.220]  That's progressive the Stockholm municipal politician a member of the sweden democrats
[03:55:52.620 --> 03:55:57.500]  Was targeted in a deliberate arson attack on her home in the latest assault on the populist party and its members
[03:55:57.980 --> 03:56:01.580]  The unnamed municipal politicians home was targeted in the early morning of sunday
[03:56:02.300 --> 03:56:04.300]  While she and her partner were up late drinking wine
[03:56:04.460 --> 03:56:11.100]  The woman said that both she and her partner smelled burning and upon examination saw the corner of their wooden home was on fire
[03:56:11.100 --> 03:56:19.820]  Police believe the arson attempt was intentional. So again populist conservative politicians literally being attacked at home set on fire
[03:56:20.620 --> 03:56:22.540]  in sweden
[03:56:22.540 --> 03:56:28.780]  We have this out the express horror as carplers into crowd of 100 children and teachers police manhunt underway
[03:56:29.500 --> 03:56:31.740]  This was in hungers near Malmo in sweden
[03:56:32.460 --> 03:56:36.140]  The carplers into crowd of children and their parents on a walk near Karlsham in sweden
[03:56:36.140 --> 03:56:42.700]  Luckily only two children. I believe were injured and the injuries were relatively minor
[03:56:43.660 --> 03:56:48.780]  Children threw themselves out of the way of the college appeared to have aimed directly for the group of 100 people
[03:56:49.020 --> 03:56:52.460]  The car accelerated into the group of students and teachers
[03:56:53.020 --> 03:56:55.740]  They haven't caught the culprit. They don't know the motive yet
[03:56:55.820 --> 03:56:57.180]  But from weiser on twitter
[03:56:57.180 --> 03:57:02.780]  There were attempts to even hide the reporting of this story because of obviously what it would entail
[03:57:02.780 --> 03:57:05.820]  Absolutely chilling situation
[03:57:06.700 --> 03:57:11.260]  Guardian reports trump urges will to reject globalism in un speech that draws mocking laughter
[03:57:12.220 --> 03:57:18.140]  I was laughing more at the faces of the un globalists who trump completely tore apart during this
[03:57:18.140 --> 03:57:20.140]  I think it was like a 30 minute speech
[03:57:20.300 --> 03:57:29.500]  Absolutely delectable telling everyone to reject socialism telling the un to go screw themselves when it comes to the international criminal court and mass migration agenda
[03:57:29.500 --> 03:57:35.580]  You have to watch this speech. It's imperative. I think it was better than trump's inauguration speech
