[00:00.000 --> 00:12.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.840 --> 00:21.600]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.600 --> 00:30.440]  well I don't usually get butterflies about a guest on the show I didn't get
[00:30.440 --> 00:34.920]  almost heart attack level butterflies when Matt Grudge surprised me let some
[00:34.920 --> 00:38.200]  of the crew knew he was coming a few days before and then just during a one
[00:38.200 --> 00:41.320]  minute break came into the studio and it's Matt Grudge standing there I don't
[00:41.320 --> 00:46.360]  know four or five weeks ago and really around that time I was also starting to
[00:46.360 --> 00:53.640]  work on another big guest and because my show is controversial it's not just one
[00:53.640 --> 00:57.240]  of the biggest interviews you can get in the world right now you add it together
[00:57.240 --> 01:04.080]  with my broadcast it will be extremely explosive politically it's surreal quite
[01:04.080 --> 01:08.840]  frankly this will be bigger than the Piers Morgan story that was the biggest
[01:08.840 --> 01:14.400]  political blow-up in 2013 according to the LA Times CNN and others they did big
[01:14.400 --> 01:20.200]  polls so I never get butterflies we're talking maybe every 10 years I got them
[01:20.200 --> 01:28.600]  real bad right now to the point of I almost don't even want to be on the air
[01:28.600 --> 01:33.960]  right now until it happens because it's like getting the 5,000 pound Marlin
[01:33.960 --> 01:37.680]  right up to your boat but I don't want to say I've got the fish on the line
[01:37.680 --> 01:43.920]  until it's in the boat but about 25 minutes or less I'll be announcing who
[01:43.920 --> 01:49.360]  is on the show so I really look forward to it and I don't normally spend three
[01:49.360 --> 01:54.680]  hours writing questions like I did last night I knew last week this interview
[01:54.680 --> 01:58.960]  was supposedly happening today but as it neared and as we talked to his people
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.320]  and as all of it got set up I got pretty excited but I'm gonna let the drudge
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.200]  report tell folks in about 15 minutes who's coming on the show another thing
[02:08.200 --> 02:12.200]  is Skype testing on the road is always a hassle so that's going on right now as
[02:12.200 --> 02:15.440]  we speak with them so I'd rather be in there monkeying around with that to make
[02:15.440 --> 02:19.200]  sure it all happens because the bigger the interview the more gremlins
[02:19.200 --> 02:24.800]  snafus tend to get in the way but that's not something I particularly worried
[02:24.800 --> 02:30.240]  about here today but this will be an important interview not just for this
[02:30.240 --> 02:33.320]  broadcast of Liberty Movement but the questions that will be asked are going
[02:33.320 --> 02:38.480]  to be very very important and will definitely have an effect on a lot of
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.520]  things happening on the planet let's look at some of these headlines EU has
[02:42.520 --> 02:46.000]  been caught in secret deals with Turkey to bring in the illegals what you don't
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.560]  just think Turkey opened its border up and told folks they could only traverse
[02:49.560 --> 02:53.600]  Turkey but couldn't stay there how like Mexico did with Central and South
[02:53.600 --> 02:58.800]  America that was a public deal that was secret at first well now it's come out
[02:58.800 --> 03:02.440]  in mainstream news will be covering that Globe and Mail and others that they
[03:02.440 --> 03:05.640]  have a secret deal with Turkey that's now gone public and now they're going to
[03:05.640 --> 03:09.720]  bring in hundreds of thousands if not millions more on top of the four million
[03:09.720 --> 03:14.040]  that have already been brought in that's coming up Trump was right video
[03:14.040 --> 03:19.560]  describes how Jersey City Muslims held pre-planned 9-11 rooftop celebrations I
[03:19.560 --> 03:24.200]  remember this at the time so actually had the crew go dig around we found a
[03:24.200 --> 03:28.360]  Washington Post about it first Trump tweeted it last weekend and now they
[03:28.360 --> 03:34.280]  found New York Post and now we have Dan Rather coming out and saying it on
[03:34.280 --> 03:39.080]  national television years ago so I guess he's evil too and making stuff up now
[03:39.080 --> 03:43.880]  because he's against the Democrats when he is a Democrat so that's coming up
[03:43.880 --> 03:49.480]  he's been 100% vindicated Iraqis think the US is in cahoots with the Islamic
[03:49.480 --> 03:52.880]  state and is hurting the war well they don't think that they know that they've
[03:52.880 --> 03:56.600]  documented it but there it is in the Washington Post Donald Trump dares to
[03:56.600 --> 04:01.120]  say that Turkey looks like they're on the side of ISIS well it's been proven and
[04:01.120 --> 04:07.120]  now Russian president has released proof of Turkey's role in ISIS oil trade
[04:07.120 --> 04:12.560]  with satellite photos and and video surveillance of the border of the big
[04:12.560 --> 04:17.920]  terminals where the oils brought in it's like a McDonald's truck pulling up an
[04:17.920 --> 04:22.080]  offloading frozen beef patties at a McDonald's it's like is this truck in
[04:22.080 --> 04:25.480]  cahoots with McDonald's it's got McDonald's on the side it's pulling up
[04:25.480 --> 04:30.720]  delivering it's backing up going beep beep beep beep I mean it's it's not rocket
[04:30.720 --> 04:35.440]  science and Urgun said he'd resign if this could be proven well that's NBC News
[04:35.440 --> 04:41.240]  reporting on all that so that's that's some of what's coming up today
[04:41.240 --> 04:47.280]  Jeb Bush hints his VP pick to be a woman I'll give you a hint it's not Jeb Bush
[04:47.280 --> 04:53.800]  it's coming on 25 minutes I'm Alex Jones stay with us in full wars calm the
[04:53.800 --> 04:58.360]  nightly news is in force news calm stay with us
[04:58.360 --> 05:04.920]  Obama's trip to the UN Global Warming Summit emits more CO2 than driving 72
[05:04.920 --> 05:09.880]  cars for a year reports the daily caller the trip will send more CO2 into the
[05:09.880 --> 05:15.080]  atmosphere than 31 American homes energy usage for an entire year that's
[05:15.080 --> 05:22.840]  equivalent to burning 368,331 pounds of coal or 797 barrels of
[05:22.840 --> 05:28.600]  oil according to the EPA just one leg of the president's Sunday trip to Paris
[05:28.600 --> 05:37.640]  emitted 189 tons of CO2 after traveling 3,855 miles and burning 19,275
[05:37.640 --> 05:42.200]  gallons of jet fuel according to daily caller calculations the president has
[05:42.200 --> 05:46.520]  been criticized for leaving a massive carbon footprint in the name of fighting

[08:32.080 --> 08:40.240]  in 345 global sycophants burned 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide to meet in Paris
[08:40.240 --> 08:45.200]  to impose a legally binding carbon taxation plan that will be proactively
[08:45.200 --> 08:50.560]  enforcing climate justice the first legally binding carbon reduction plan
[08:50.560 --> 08:55.520]  the people of the world have faced this afternoon French police fired tear gas
[08:55.520 --> 08:59.520]  at a group of demonstrators close to the place the Lyra public there was a
[08:59.520 --> 09:05.200]  planned demonstration a climate change protest demonstration that was supposed
[09:05.200 --> 09:08.360]  to happen today hundreds of thousands indeed were expected but it was
[09:08.360 --> 09:12.120]  cancelled because as you know there's a state of emergency in the country at the
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.240]  moment after the terror attacks in Paris and we salute the people of Paris for
[09:17.240 --> 09:25.080]  insisting this crucial conference go on an act of defiance that proves nothing
[09:25.080 --> 09:30.560]  will deter us from building the future we want for our children Obama has
[09:30.560 --> 09:34.040]  already spent seven hundred and eighty four thousand eight hundred and twenty five
[09:34.040 --> 09:39.040]  dollars on his motorcade alone the New York Daily News reports President
[09:39.040 --> 09:44.920]  Obama's flight to the city of lights emitted roughly 189 tons of carbon
[09:44.920 --> 09:49.320]  alone burning nineteen thousand two hundred and seventy five gallons of jet
[09:49.320 --> 09:55.080]  fuel reports the daily caller his entire trip will send more carbon dioxide
[09:55.080 --> 10:01.360]  into the air than the combined emissions from 31 u.s. homes over the span of a
[10:01.360 --> 10:06.000]  year when you don't have to worry about a positive return on investment you can
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.400]  waste a lot of taxpayer money it's hard-working Americans whose money has
[10:09.400 --> 10:13.840]  been invested I keep hearing this look there's an element of risk and I
[10:13.840 --> 10:17.520]  understand there's an element of risk but when you take hard-earned American
[10:17.520 --> 10:24.480]  tax dollars and you throw it at an agenda rather than at a strategy and you
[10:24.480 --> 10:27.840]  see the waste only in this time can you swander money and not worry about it
[10:27.840 --> 10:31.080]  because there's an endless supply of it man if you don't have enough money for
[10:31.080 --> 10:35.000]  that project don't worry we'll get more money we'll just we'll just raise taxes
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.880]  and we'll throw some more money at that we'll re a lot money to you and I think
[10:37.880 --> 10:41.760]  that's really where we're at today the State Department spent four hundred and
[10:41.760 --> 10:46.400]  seven thousand eight hundred and sixty eight dollars on limos the contracted
[10:46.400 --> 10:50.600]  propaganda press spent three hundred and seventy six thousand nine hundred and
[10:50.600 --> 10:54.520]  fifty seven dollars when it was all tallied up the American taxpayers have
[10:54.520 --> 10:58.240]  already spent one million eight hundred and five thousand two hundred and eighty
[10:58.240 --> 11:02.880]  two dollars to send a group of elitist New World Order stooges to another
[11:02.880 --> 11:07.680]  country to legally scale back their taxpayers living standards through
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.800]  incorporated agenda 21 initiatives once again the liberal sociopaths are
[11:13.800 --> 11:18.160]  ignoring the scientific facts and statistics instead pulling at our
[11:18.160 --> 11:22.760]  heartstrings and ramming lies and guilt down our throats in order to achieve
[11:22.760 --> 11:28.160]  their New World Order agenda they lie to people and say that penguins cannot
[11:28.160 --> 11:33.080]  swim in the Antarctic and that in the Arctic polar bears are dying even
[11:33.080 --> 11:37.600]  though National Geographic has to admit polar bear numbers are up five fold
[11:37.600 --> 11:43.080]  since the 1950s and are now invading areas not previously known to be in
[11:43.080 --> 11:48.240]  their range most sufferers of Stockholm syndrome will tell you that Obama and
[11:48.240 --> 11:53.080]  company need that money because they are important people making important
[11:53.080 --> 11:58.000]  decisions however the importance of any of these New World Order lackeys
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.120]  will likely be as a stain in the footnote of history where stupidity
[12:03.120 --> 12:08.880]  hubris and greed raised its grisly self-important criminal head to once
[12:08.880 --> 12:15.000]  again challenge humanity's intelligence and resolve after 1989 present Bush kept
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  with said and it's a phrase that I often use myself that we needed a New World

[13:11.920 --> 13:18.400]  conflagration of world leaders ever not just for a UN conference this is a big
[13:18.400 --> 13:24.760]  one and David Knight will be hosting in the fourth hour today and I will assure
[13:24.760 --> 13:31.600]  you he will be talking about the guests we have joining us in about 17 minutes

[14:12.280 --> 14:16.280]  it's like a chemistry set you add those two ingredients together it's called
[14:16.280 --> 14:22.920]  explosive and the individual coming on knows full well that's why this is being
[14:22.920 --> 14:31.560]  done so look for that in about 16 17 minutes from now Ted Nugent Lord
[14:31.560 --> 14:37.440]  Moncton and others here on the broadcast today and the reason I get so
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.560]  excited about this is learning some things behind the scenes it's very exciting
[14:42.560 --> 14:49.000]  to see how awake people are people that I wasn't sure about a year ago six months
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.880]  ago even three or four months ago and then to find out that sure enough people
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.760]  know a lot more they're even letting on to there is a battle folks in fact that's
[14:57.760 --> 15:01.720]  one of the questions I didn't write down that I want to get to the internal
[15:01.720 --> 15:10.080]  battle in the government right now the secret war for the heart of America
[15:10.080 --> 15:14.240]  it's going on there are a lot of good people in the government and in the
[15:14.240 --> 15:20.680]  media who do not want to destroy the country and be slaves and there is what
[15:20.680 --> 15:24.320]  I've been already told about from generals and congressmen and women and
[15:24.320 --> 15:29.000]  senators on and off record that this fight's been intensifying the last few
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.600]  years and now has reached fever pitch basically almost at the level it was in
[15:34.600 --> 15:41.120]  1944 in Germany when they ran Operation Valkyrie to try to take Hitler out but
[15:41.120 --> 15:46.280]  this war is not being run with plastic explosives with members of the general
[15:46.280 --> 15:50.600]  staff trying to blow Hitler up it's being done in information war because in
[15:50.600 --> 15:57.360]  the modern world as the Pentagon has said 90% of war is informational and old
[15:57.360 --> 16:02.600]  Hillary told Congress a few years ago they're losing the info war and as a
[16:02.600 --> 16:07.920]  21-year talk show host I don't want to say I'm an expert on the info war even
[16:07.920 --> 16:14.640]  though 18 years ago I dubbed the show info wars but we focus on the info war
[16:14.640 --> 16:19.520]  quite a bit and that's why info wars is such a big focal point in the info
[16:19.520 --> 16:25.320]  war there are stranger things in heaven and earth and in all those books isn't
[16:25.320 --> 16:31.000]  there there's such a thing as providence and fate in this world I don't think the
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.080]  globalists really estimated properly the type of fight they get when they got
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.160]  down to the wire butchering this country and destroying it forever let's get into
[16:40.160 --> 16:43.920]  some of the top stories I remember when Donald Trump came out two weeks ago and
[16:43.920 --> 16:47.600]  said that Muslims were celebrating by the thousands radical Muslims the the
[16:47.600 --> 16:51.680]  downing of the World Trade Centers and I remembered like it was in the New York
[16:51.680 --> 16:56.520]  Post I mentioned this a few weeks ago and it was in the BBC and it was they were
[16:56.520 --> 17:02.680]  doing it in Palestine they were doing it in Saudi Arabia in Mexico folks in
[17:02.680 --> 17:07.760]  Mexico City were booing the US team and chanting of some of bin Laden I remember
[17:07.760 --> 17:12.080]  hearing about it in New Jersey and New York people being kicked out of school
[17:12.080 --> 17:16.520]  because they were celebrating groups were and saying you know God is great the
[17:16.520 --> 17:20.240]  towers have been brought down I remember seeing it so I had our crew go dig
[17:20.240 --> 17:23.720]  through it Watson found a couple articles Washington Post a few others
[17:23.720 --> 17:29.600]  New York Post and that kind of checkmated them for a while but now we
[17:29.600 --> 17:34.280]  found Dan rather saying it and everybody else and so the mainstream media is
[17:34.280 --> 17:38.480]  going oh Trump exaggerated down no he didn't there were thousands of radical
[17:38.480 --> 17:43.480]  Muslims that celebrated just like at two different sporting events last week
[17:43.480 --> 17:46.800]  during the minute of silence for the dead people in France there was a la
[17:46.800 --> 17:50.960]  Akbar chance I mean did that not happen to that was tens of thousands chanting
[17:50.960 --> 17:54.080]  if not hundreds of thousands let's go ahead and go to this compilation
[17:54.080 --> 17:58.320]  breaking it down you guys know that they were dancing in the streets of
[17:58.320 --> 18:00.960]  Palestine they were all dancing in the streets my brother worked there he was
[18:00.960 --> 18:05.920]  driving people dancing in the street is another apartment building one that
[18:05.920 --> 18:10.880]  investigated told me court is swarming with suspects suspects who I'm told were
[18:10.880 --> 18:16.000]  cheering on the roof when they saw the plane slam into the train center police
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  were called to the building by other neighbors and found eight men celebrated
[18:20.000 --> 18:28.440]  six of them got on the open 14 years ago here and I see a lot of people and
[18:28.440 --> 18:34.000]  they were just chanting and raving and when I come back we're gonna come back
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.760]  with Dan rather Dan rather talking about I'm gonna play the whole clip
[18:38.760 --> 18:43.520]  uninterrupted oh I guess we've got time till break let's let's keep rolling it
[18:43.520 --> 18:49.680]  now here it is and they were saying burn America and you know all these things
[18:49.680 --> 18:53.760]  about America but there's several witnesses to say this happened they got
[18:53.760 --> 18:57.040]  on the roof of the building to look across they knew what was gonna happen
[18:57.040 --> 19:01.520]  they were waiting for it to happen and when it happened they celebrated they
[19:01.520 --> 19:08.440]  they jumped for joy everyone that was out there they're only 13 maybe 14 at
[19:08.440 --> 19:12.160]  most they were kids they didn't know what they were doing but they had so much
[19:12.160 --> 19:19.080]  hate and they were doing that it was just so sad but the larger issue so that's
[19:19.080 --> 19:26.800]  Dan rather that CBS news that's MTV but let's just get past that okay the point
[19:26.800 --> 19:33.120]  is radical Muslims all over the world from Indonesia to Saudi Arabia to
[19:33.120 --> 19:38.200]  Palestine of the Gaza Strip celebrated it and anybody who has a memory remembers
[19:38.200 --> 19:42.600]  that and the mainstream corporate whore media wanted to lie to everybody and
[19:42.600 --> 19:47.600]  just say it didn't happen and then demonize Donald Trump because he said
[19:47.600 --> 19:50.880]  it was happening it's like Donald Trump says the sky is blue and they spent two
[19:50.880 --> 19:55.120]  weeks saying he's a liar no it is blue and and the bottom line is there was
[19:55.120 --> 20:00.080]  celebration all over the world and they've been proven wrong again my name
[20:00.080 --> 20:04.960]  is Bill Bonner and I have an important message right now the highest levels of
[20:04.960 --> 20:09.440]  government are struggling against an inevitable crisis but they're about to

[24:22.080 --> 24:26.440]  well there's the headline at DrudgeReport.com of your TV viewer radio
[24:26.440 --> 24:32.160]  lesser go to DrudgeReport.com 60 days to Iowa Trump dominates in every major
[24:32.160 --> 24:38.360]  poll despite the fact that we're seeing push polls and headlines saying Trump's
[24:38.360 --> 24:43.000]  lead drops we just keep hearing that for the last few months this is a clear
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.360]  attempt to drive down his poll numbers and that's why he keeps surging in the
[24:50.360 --> 24:56.000]  polls another drudge link is that a black activist the police are reporting
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.560]  is the main one issuing the latest threats to kill people kill minorities
[25:01.560 --> 25:07.400]  this is another form of false flag that we see more and more by the left to
[25:07.400 --> 25:11.480]  basically stir up cultural and racial division this is part of the left's
[25:11.480 --> 25:17.400]  plan to destabilize the country with civil unrest ahead of the 2016 election
[25:17.400 --> 25:21.360]  are there some problems with corrupt police absolutely I literally wrote
[25:21.360 --> 25:25.320]  the book on as everybody knows on the police state trying to stop our police
[25:25.320 --> 25:33.840]  being turned into globalized federalized robo cops but that too ladies and
[25:33.840 --> 25:38.000]  gentlemen is part of the larger plan to then have the people see the police as
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.480]  the enemy and not the policymakers that created and set up this political
[25:42.480 --> 25:46.280]  climate so we're gonna be discussing all of that and more now if you go to
[25:46.280 --> 25:51.200]  drudge report.com right up in the left-hand side right there corner
[25:51.200 --> 25:57.080]  Trump set for Alex Jones radio developing and Donald Trump is scheduled
[25:57.080 --> 26:01.000]  to be on with us we're connecting here in about five minutes at Trump Tower in
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.760]  New York City to be joining us live on air and drudge report.com in the upper
[26:06.760 --> 26:12.880]  left-hand corner has that link now the reason I'm so excited about this
[26:12.880 --> 26:21.040]  interview is that basically one of his top-level advisors political advisors
[26:21.040 --> 26:27.520]  reached out to us and said would you like to interview Donald Trump and I
[26:27.520 --> 26:32.400]  said well yeah we even tried I mean and they said sure and and basically I was
[26:32.400 --> 26:36.480]  filled in on the fact that Donald Trump is really aware of what's going on the
[26:36.480 --> 26:40.920]  world he's shown that exposing ISIS being Western backed and Turkey selling the
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.960]  oil and we should bomb their oil fields in Syria he's really been proven right
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.440]  over and over again it's because he's got some really good advisors and the last
[26:49.440 --> 26:53.960]  month and a half or so I was kind of let in to just some of the facts of how much
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.520]  research they're really doing and the fact that they're aware that there is
[26:57.520 --> 27:02.080]  basically a clowered pivot plan to take down this country as we all know as
[27:02.080 --> 27:07.560]  well but the fact is that Donald Trump understands that and really does want to
[27:07.560 --> 27:11.680]  try to come in and save the country is very very exciting because if you don't
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.240]  recognize that there's a plan to bring down this country and that Hillary
[27:16.240 --> 27:20.520]  Clinton is a criminal and that Barack Obama is a globalist hell-bent on
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.720]  world government there's no way to beat them because you're not raising your
[27:23.720 --> 27:29.160]  response to the level of the attack you're under the threat continuum it's
[27:29.160 --> 27:32.120]  not like cop you know a cops out there pulling somebody over for broken tail
[27:32.120 --> 27:35.480]  light it's like cops showing up at a hostage situation with a thousand
[27:35.480 --> 27:38.680]  hostages and you know a hundred terrorists I mean what's the threat
[27:38.680 --> 27:43.720]  continuum there you don't respond with you know one beat cop who doesn't even
[27:43.720 --> 27:49.600]  have a gun you've got to respond with heavy political firepower to something
[27:49.600 --> 27:54.240]  that serious and this country is being dismantled right now so Donald Trump is
[27:54.240 --> 27:57.640]  coming up and we're very excited about that because I've got a lot of really
[27:57.640 --> 28:00.720]  important questions some of which have been asked some of which haven't been
[28:00.720 --> 28:06.000]  asked that I want to go over with him at the start of the next segment and
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.600]  there's so much other news now to go over but this is the day now that the
[28:10.600 --> 28:14.200]  Dan rather videos out all these newspaper articles around saying that
[28:14.200 --> 28:19.680]  radical Muslims celebrated not just in New Jersey but New York and in the West
[28:19.680 --> 28:25.120]  Bank by Israel and so many other places we know radical Islamists has
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.240]  celebrated a few weeks ago the two different soccer teams during the
[28:28.240 --> 28:35.520]  minute of silence booing the dead booing the dead and saying Allah Akbar in the
[28:35.520 --> 28:39.680]  minute of silence and so the mainstream apologist media wants to cover this up
[28:39.680 --> 28:44.680]  and act like it didn't happen I mean what are they gonna say if Trump comes out
[28:44.680 --> 28:48.680]  and says it's wrong to say Allah Akbar during a minute of silence for people
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.400]  that are killed at the Paris attacks 130 something are they gonna say that
[28:53.400 --> 28:58.400]  didn't happen because this is what they do even when he links to a New York
[28:58.400 --> 29:02.640]  post article from a few days after 9-11 they say oh that doesn't matter you're
[29:02.640 --> 29:07.400]  still wrong well you know what that's why mainstream media is so dead that's
[29:07.400 --> 29:09.880]  why they're falling apart they're collapsing they're pathetic they really
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.640]  are a joke and that's not rhetoric these people are sickening lying discredited
[29:14.640 --> 29:18.320]  jokes nine times out of ten now there's still some people in mainstream media
[29:18.320 --> 29:21.320]  that do a pretty good job but looks like that lady at CBS we exposed fast and
[29:21.320 --> 29:25.080]  furious the White House shipping all those guns to Mexico to blend the Second
[29:25.080 --> 29:29.440]  Amendment they ran her out of CBS News when she broke that she had to fight to
[29:29.440 --> 29:32.680]  get it out there so real journalists get targeted in this country it's like the
[29:32.680 --> 29:36.080]  top French meteorologist came out and said global warming being man-made's a
[29:36.080 --> 29:40.480]  fraud they fired him these people are totalitarians folks and they want to
[29:40.480 --> 29:45.120]  shut up our free speech they want to shut this country down and Donald Trump is
[29:45.120 --> 29:53.360]  standing up against it we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:53.360 --> 30:03.080]  and the GCN radio network three years ago half of the 16 billion dollars doled
[30:03.080 --> 30:06.200]  out to the Department of Energy loan guarantee program was invested in
[30:06.200 --> 30:09.920]  companies that had gone bankrupt were laying off workers or headed for
[30:09.920 --> 30:13.360]  bankruptcy but the Department of Energy didn't learn from its mal investments
[30:13.360 --> 30:18.680]  it then invested three billion dollars in a Spanish company Ebon Goa now three
[30:18.680 --> 30:22.760]  years later one day before the Paris Climate Summit Ebon Goa declared
[30:22.760 --> 30:26.800]  bankruptcy the three billion dollars of taxpayer money that will likely be lost
[30:26.800 --> 30:32.160]  in whole or in part is six times bigger than Selengra green renewable mandates
[30:32.160 --> 30:35.520]  have brought energy poverty to the people of Spain where electricity is
[30:35.520 --> 30:39.600]  triple what it costs in the U.S. electricity will become a luxury in the
[30:39.600 --> 30:44.760]  U.S. as well that Obama is allowed to continue his crony climatism the Paris
[30:44.760 --> 30:48.680]  Summit seeks to accelerate the economic decline of the West transferring wealth
[30:48.680 --> 30:52.600]  to developing nations in the form of green infrastructure but it's just

[33:30.640 --> 33:34.480]  studio only does interview every three four years and I thought that got me
[33:34.480 --> 33:39.440]  excited but I'm telling Donald Trump is our guest ladies and gentlemen for the
[33:39.440 --> 33:45.520]  next 30 minutes or so and obviously he is a maverick he's an original he tells
[33:45.520 --> 33:49.120]  it like it is doesn't read off a teleprompter neither do I he's self-made
[33:49.120 --> 33:52.400]  this whole media operation that reaches 20 million people a week worldwide
[33:52.400 --> 33:57.840]  conservatively self-made that's why I'm so excited and he joins us from Trump
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.440]  Tower in New York City he is the leading 2016 Republican presidential
[34:02.440 --> 34:07.640]  contender Donald Trump again joins us and I've got so many questions but but
[34:07.640 --> 34:12.520]  first off Donald thank you for joining us thank you Alex great great to be with
[34:12.520 --> 34:17.080]  you I've got so many questions but you are vindicated this has got to be the
[34:17.080 --> 34:21.480]  50th time the last six months on the radical Muslim celebrating not just in
[34:21.480 --> 34:25.800]  New Jersey but New York Palestine all over what do you have to say they're
[34:25.800 --> 34:29.800]  still attacking you though we've got Dan rather on video we've got New York
[34:29.800 --> 34:35.000]  post we've got Washington post we've got I mean what's going on here well I
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.360]  took a lot of heat and I was very strong on it and I held my line and then all
[34:39.360 --> 34:42.640]  of a sudden you know hundreds of people were calling up my office I was the other
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.040]  day in Sarasota Florida and people are in line and we had 12,000 people which is
[34:47.040 --> 34:51.200]  fantastic and the people were saying many of the people from New Jersey four
[34:51.200 --> 34:55.160]  or five people said Mr. Trump I sought myself I was there they talked about
[34:55.160 --> 34:59.800]  Patterson but they said I sought myself Mr. Trump I was there so many people have
[34:59.800 --> 35:04.920]  called in and on Twitter at real Donald Trump they're all tweeting so I knew it
[35:04.920 --> 35:09.840]  happened and I held my line and people wanted me to apologize and we can't do
[35:09.840 --> 35:13.360]  that people like you and I can't do that so easily now we can do it if we're
[35:13.360 --> 35:17.040]  wrong Alex you apologize I'd apologize if I was wrong but they were
[35:17.040 --> 35:20.560]  celebrating and they were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center I
[35:20.560 --> 35:25.360]  think that's disgraceful it is and that same week you were reporting on that
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.920]  fact we had two different international football games soccer games with the
[35:29.920 --> 35:34.360]  Turkish fans and others during the moment of silence for the dead people in
[35:34.360 --> 35:40.200]  in Paris chanting Allah Akbar and booing so did that not happen too well
[35:40.200 --> 35:43.760]  that happened and everybody saw it that was a week ago and the players were out
[35:43.760 --> 35:46.120]  on the field and they couldn't believe it they were embarrassed they didn't know
[35:46.120 --> 35:49.760]  what to do the coach and the managers they all apologize but it happened look
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.080]  we have to deal with reality and you know it all started because they said we
[35:54.080 --> 35:57.640]  need surveillance we need proper surveillance we have people that truly
[35:57.640 --> 36:01.920]  are evil and they're coming from someplace and you know sort of where
[36:01.920 --> 36:05.520]  they're coming from at least the vicinity and I said we need proper
[36:05.520 --> 36:09.520]  surveillance whether it's a mosque or any place else we have to be surveilled and
[36:09.520 --> 36:13.320]  we have to see what's coming at us because we're not gonna have a country
[36:13.320 --> 36:16.720]  anymore between the weak borders that we have the pathetic and weak borders
[36:16.720 --> 36:21.400]  where politicians are afraid to do anything about it between all of what's
[36:21.400 --> 36:24.880]  happening with radical you know you look at what's going on you have a
[36:24.880 --> 36:29.840]  president that doesn't even want to talk about you know the radical Muslim stuff
[36:29.840 --> 36:33.520]  he doesn't want to mention the word he doesn't want to say it but you look at
[36:33.520 --> 36:36.440]  what's happening where we have a president that's over there celebrating
[36:36.440 --> 36:40.120]  global warming and trying to get everybody excited about global warming
[36:40.120 --> 36:44.000]  like that's our number one problem he considers that to be our number one
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.600]  problem and our number one problem is what's going on where they want to blow
[36:47.600 --> 36:50.560]  up our cities and they want to blow up our country that's our number one
[36:50.560 --> 36:54.920]  problem and then our number two problem is crippled America your number one
[36:54.920 --> 36:57.400]  New York Times bestseller we're gonna talk about that in a few minutes but
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.640]  let's continue with the number one problem and I agree with you it's now in
[37:01.640 --> 37:06.200]  mainstream news Associated Press and others are reporting that it's a secret
[37:06.200 --> 37:12.040]  deal with Turkey with the Germans with Merkel the admitted socialist to bring
[37:12.040 --> 37:17.000]  in millions of radical Islamists they admit almost all of them are Sunni that
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  basically invaded Syria they're getting their butt kicked by the Russians so now
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.320]  they want to flee up to the north into Turkey you said months ago bomb the oil
[37:26.320 --> 37:29.720]  of ISIS in the in the mainstream media laugh because you said the sky was blue
[37:29.720 --> 37:34.120]  again now the Pentagon says that's the right thing to do and now you've come
[37:34.120 --> 37:40.560]  out saying quote it looks like that Turkey's on the side of ISIS close quote
[37:40.560 --> 37:45.240]  well that the next day the Russians released satellite photos documenting
[37:45.240 --> 37:48.920]  that there are literally thousands of trucks coming up to the border at these
[37:48.920 --> 37:54.760]  huge terminals connected to airgun the president's son making billions of
[37:54.760 --> 37:59.560]  dollars total off of this again you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue
[37:59.560 --> 38:03.360]  well I was right about that I was right in saying in a book that I wrote you
[38:03.360 --> 38:07.080]  covered it really nicely I appreciate it but I wrote a very political book years
[38:07.080 --> 38:11.800]  ago in the year 2000 the America we deserve and I said to that book that we
[38:11.800 --> 38:15.200]  better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden I mean I really study
[38:15.200 --> 38:18.600]  this stuff I really find it very interesting and even though I'm a
[38:18.600 --> 38:22.520]  businessman I find it I've always thought I always have been involved in
[38:22.520 --> 38:26.320]  politics I said we better be careful with Osama bin Laden there's a guy named
[38:26.320 --> 38:30.080]  Osama bin Laden nobody really knew who he was but he was nasty he was saying
[38:30.080 --> 38:34.360]  really nasty things about our country and what he wants to do to it and I
[38:34.360 --> 38:37.480]  wrote in the book 2000 two years before the World Trade Center came down I
[38:37.480 --> 38:40.320]  talked about Osama bin Laden you better take him out I said he's gonna grow
[38:40.320 --> 38:44.920]  under a rock you better take him out and now people are seeing that the saying
[38:44.920 --> 38:49.280]  you know Trump predicted Osama bin Laden which actually is true and then two
[38:49.280 --> 38:52.040]  years later a year and a half later he knocked down the World Trade Center and
[38:52.040 --> 38:56.000]  I talked about terrorism and that that was before terrorism as we know it today I
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.480]  said we better be careful that's gonna happen it's gonna be a big thing and it
[38:59.480 --> 39:03.440]  certainly is a big thing so with the oil and I'm glad you brought it up but as
[39:03.440 --> 39:06.080]  you know for three years I've been saying you better take out the oil
[39:06.080 --> 39:09.680]  because if you don't take the oil it's gonna be a problem so we shouldn't have
[39:09.680 --> 39:14.640]  been in Iraq but once we got there the way Osama the way we came out was was
[39:14.640 --> 39:19.320]  horrible and I said take the oil then we didn't take the oil so ISIS got the
[39:19.320 --> 39:22.800]  oil and as you know Iran is getting the because Iran is gonna take over all of
[39:22.800 --> 39:27.280]  Iraq you know we made one of the worst deals in the history of our world when
[39:27.280 --> 39:31.360]  we gave them a hundred and fifty billion dollars and virtually we gave them keys
[39:31.360 --> 39:35.640]  to nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump I hate to interrupt you you are the leading
[39:35.640 --> 39:39.240]  presidential frontrunner with the Republicans gaining a huge lead as you
[39:39.240 --> 39:42.680]  don't back down but I've got to just back you up again because the more I
[39:42.680 --> 39:46.480]  researched what you've actually said and done it's amazing you were the only
[39:46.480 --> 39:51.920]  leading American figure who openly said do not go to war in Iraq they had
[39:51.920 --> 39:57.080]  almost what 90% votes in Congress for it bipartisan you said don't do it Iran
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.240]  will take over you said I mean look you can say that today and everybody can say
[40:01.240 --> 40:07.240]  that but you said that in 2001 2002 2003 when it was very unpopular because you've
[40:07.240 --> 40:11.280]  done your research and had good advisors how did you know that when almost no one
[40:11.280 --> 40:15.680]  else did well first of all I'm the most militaristic person there is I'm gonna
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.400]  build the mill if I win I'm gonna make our military so strong so powerful that
[40:19.400 --> 40:22.680]  nobody's gonna mess with us we're gonna take care of our vets and all of that
[40:22.680 --> 40:26.000]  but I have to tell you have to know if you're gonna go to war you have to do it
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.400]  properly and you have to know what to do I viewed it as this Iran and Iraq were
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.040]  the same in terms of strength and they'd have they constantly fighting that's
[40:34.040 --> 40:38.040]  all they do is they fight right they go to war all the time and they'd move 10
[40:38.040 --> 40:41.560]  feet left 10 feet right 10 feet left then they'd rest and then they've started
[40:41.560 --> 40:46.480]  again four years that this has been gone on for years forever and this is the way
[40:46.480 --> 40:51.480]  it is I said if you take out Iran or if you take out Iraq either one you're
[40:51.480 --> 40:56.400]  gonna destabilize the Middle East well we took out Iraq and by the way Iraq has
[40:56.400 --> 41:00.040]  the second largest oil reserves in the world people don't even know that so we
[41:00.040 --> 41:04.240]  gave like incredible we took out Iraq I said you're gonna destabilize well and I
[41:04.240 --> 41:07.680]  said and you'll know this and you know this and I appreciate what you just said
[41:07.680 --> 41:13.720]  then Iran is gonna come in and Iran is going to take over Iraq and they they're
[41:13.720 --> 41:16.840]  just taking it over right now as we speak they're taking it over Iran is
[41:16.840 --> 41:20.840]  running Iraq and very soon will be virtually gonna be totally running Iraq
[41:20.840 --> 41:24.960]  especially after all of you know the deal we just made which is the worst so I
[41:24.960 --> 41:29.440]  said keep the oil and I said if you're gonna leave you shouldn't have gone in
[41:29.440 --> 41:32.720]  but they shouldn't have they should have left soldiers behind like 20,000 or
[41:32.720 --> 41:36.440]  certain number of soldiers but if you're gonna leave take the oil and I've said it
[41:36.440 --> 41:41.120]  then they left they didn't take the oil so ISIS got the oil Iran is getting the
[41:41.120 --> 41:44.960]  oil everybody's getting everything but us so we lost thousands of soldiers we
[41:44.960 --> 41:49.040]  spent two trillion dollars in Iraq we have wounded warriors who I love all over
[41:49.040 --> 41:52.840]  the place and what do we get out of it else we had nothing we had nothing so the
[41:52.840 --> 41:56.080]  French and the Germans are getting the oil the Iranians are getting the oil and
[41:56.080 --> 41:59.840]  you know who the number one customer for the oil is guess what China that's right
[41:59.840 --> 42:04.760]  how smart is China they are smartest on every level militarily they are smart
[42:04.760 --> 42:09.800]  us on trade like we're losing we have a 450 billion dollar trade deficit with
[42:09.800 --> 42:13.400]  China let me ask you this you're a top business guy you know on your own from
[42:13.400 --> 42:19.960]  nothing how did China get 97% of rare earth in minerals in the world how is
[42:19.960 --> 42:23.000]  the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals when
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.520]  it's what goes in the smart phones the computers trillions is made a year how
[42:26.520 --> 42:30.680]  did we just give them the global market in that that's crazy well what a lot of
[42:30.680 --> 42:34.280]  people don't know Afghanistan now Afghanistan's a place we can go in
[42:34.280 --> 42:37.160]  because you know you have Pakistan and you have nuclear weapons a lot of things
[42:37.160 --> 42:41.560]  going on there but we go into Afghanistan we're fighting you know
[42:41.560 --> 42:45.640]  tremendous mountains and ridges we're fighting on one side and you know who's
[42:45.640 --> 42:49.320]  got their excavators on the other side China looking out all the minerals you
[42:49.320 --> 42:53.360]  know Afghanistan nobody knew this Afghanistan is rich with minerals not
[42:53.360 --> 42:57.880]  oil but minerals everything everything and China is taking out all the minerals
[42:57.880 --> 43:00.920]  and here we are fighting we have trillions we're about like a trillion
[43:00.920 --> 43:04.400]  dollars in Afghanistan and we get nothing out of it and we're gonna end up
[43:04.400 --> 43:08.080]  leaving and keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there and this and that we
[43:08.080 --> 43:12.280]  get nothing China is taking out the minerals they're the they're the buyers
[43:12.280 --> 43:17.440]  the big buyers at very very low prices of as you know of the oil in Iraq and
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.480]  probably in Syria but China is a big buyer of the oil but one thing with the
[43:21.480 --> 43:25.080]  oil it's sort of because you've covered it for three years I've been saying hit
[43:25.080 --> 43:29.120]  the oil because ISIS is getting strong and they're no JV as the president said
[43:29.120 --> 43:33.720]  and they're certainly not contained but I said hit the oil and hit them hard and
[43:33.720 --> 43:37.920]  they left at me and they would put generals on television saying no that
[43:37.920 --> 43:41.840]  strategy wouldn't work well after Paris they started hitting the oil and it does
[43:41.840 --> 43:45.600]  work the problem is we've given them a two-year edge there are billions of
[43:45.600 --> 43:49.600]  dollars started hitting the oil for one month that ISIS is already rolling over
[43:49.600 --> 43:54.480]  so Putin is following your your strategy you know Vladimir Putin well two years
[43:54.480 --> 43:58.440]  ago Alex that's the only problem Donald Trump joins us live can you speak to as
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.480]  president what your relationship would be with foreign leaders and what you
[44:02.480 --> 44:06.520]  know about Vladimir Putin because all I know is why are we starting a fight with
[44:06.520 --> 44:10.960]  Russia when they're not doing anything to us right well number one and just to
[44:10.960 --> 44:13.600]  finish on the other way I say hit the other we should keep the oil in other
[44:13.600 --> 44:17.320]  words we should keep we'll get ExxonMobil they'll go in we'll get other of our oil
[44:17.320 --> 44:20.600]  companies we'll get some of the great oil companies we bid it out we should keep
[44:20.600 --> 44:23.840]  the oil you know in the old days to the victor belong the spoils right we don't
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.680]  have that we go in we fight a war and we leave we get nothing except we get death
[44:27.680 --> 44:32.360]  and we get deficit that's all we get I think I get along great with people I
[44:32.360 --> 44:35.520]  mean I will probably get along well with him and if I don't somebody else will
[44:35.520 --> 44:39.680]  and who knows you know he's a difficult cookie he's tough and he's smart I was
[44:39.680 --> 44:44.480]  on hit the show 60 minutes with him recently not together I mean we they
[44:44.480 --> 44:47.360]  did him and they profiled me at the same show which was that we were stable
[44:47.360 --> 44:52.040]  mates right but I think I get along very well with him I think it to find look
[44:52.040 --> 44:55.440]  here's the thing we lose with every country and yet we don't get along with
[44:55.440 --> 44:59.120]  any countries China is killing us everybody's killing us China is just
[44:59.120 --> 45:03.680]  beating us to a pulp and trade Japan Mexico is killing us and yet we don't
[45:03.680 --> 45:07.040]  get along with anybody with me they're not going to get so rich believe me
[45:07.040 --> 45:10.160]  they're not going to get so rich at all we're going to take back our jobs we're
[45:10.160 --> 45:13.960]  going to take back our manufacture we take back our base but they'll like us
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.440]  more than they do now sort of amazing well Donald Trump let me say this my
[45:18.440 --> 45:25.240]  audience I'd say 90% supports you okay and you definitely have have shown your
[45:25.240 --> 45:29.320]  knowledge of geopolitical systems Hillary and others have been demonizing you
[45:29.320 --> 45:33.920]  for saying radical Muslims celebrated on 9-11 but she got caught a few years ago
[45:33.920 --> 45:39.320]  claiming that she got shot at in Bosnia in the air on the ground they have video
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.320]  that all none of it happened she admits she lied if you did that you'd be done
[45:43.320 --> 45:46.720]  but you wouldn't do something like that you don't steal glory from our veterans
[45:46.720 --> 45:50.600]  but they demonize you for made-up scandals every day trying to see what
[45:50.600 --> 45:54.960]  will stick and he got Hillary involved in Benghazi you've got him involved in
[45:54.960 --> 45:58.880]  everything and people love you for tough talk is it not time for impeachment
[45:58.880 --> 46:02.880]  hearings against Obama I mean what do we do politically to really try to
[46:02.880 --> 46:07.920]  prosecute Hillary Clinton well you remember this the best thing that we
[46:07.920 --> 46:11.800]  have going with Obama is he's got a year left okay because you know by the time
[46:11.800 --> 46:15.680]  you do the hearings and everything I don't so don't make him a martyr in a
[46:15.680 --> 46:18.160]  way you'll make him a martyr but I don't even say that you know one of the
[46:18.160 --> 46:21.360]  things that I'm the most disappointed in Republicans because they go to
[46:21.360 --> 46:23.920]  Washington they're gonna do all this stuff they're gonna impeach Obama they're
[46:23.920 --> 46:27.840]  gonna end Obamacare which has to be ended it's a desire I don't know if you've
[46:27.840 --> 46:32.640]  seen the premiums they're going up it's killing everything by 55% it's it you
[46:32.640 --> 46:38.560]  know it's going to implode anyway in 17 2017 Obamacare blows up it's over I
[46:38.560 --> 46:42.040]  mean it's over and everybody knows it and they're doing big stories even the
[46:42.040 --> 46:45.760]  ones that were for it are saying oh this isn't working well the premiums are a
[46:45.760 --> 46:49.800]  disaster and if you look at anything having to do with Obamacare right now
[46:49.800 --> 46:54.200]  it's over but the problem with the Republicans is they'll try and fix it
[46:54.200 --> 46:58.760]  they'll try instead of get rid of it and we can come up with a phenomenal plan
[46:58.760 --> 47:02.240]  that's much better for the people the people are getting killed with that so
[47:02.240 --> 47:06.480]  there's so many things to do Alex we will do such a good job there's so many
[47:06.480 --> 47:11.440]  fronts a number we'll win on trade we're gonna strengthen our military we're
[47:11.440 --> 47:14.760]  gonna take care of our vets we're gonna get rid of Obamacare we're gonna do so
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.160]  many things there's so many things that can be done but we have to use our good
[47:18.160 --> 47:21.920]  people you know everybody running against me in terms of even the
[47:21.920 --> 47:25.480]  Republican side and Hillary certainly they're all controlled by their donors
[47:25.480 --> 47:28.800]  and their special interests and the lobbyists sorry I'm putting up my own
[47:28.800 --> 47:32.080]  money I'm funding my own campaign nobody's gonna control me I'm gonna do
[47:32.080 --> 47:36.840]  what's right for you and for the American people listen I get it I mean you
[47:36.840 --> 47:41.280]  are a true Maverick I understand you made tens of millions of dollars you've
[47:41.280 --> 47:44.880]  hired tens of thousands of people I mean I would imagine that as you've gotten
[47:44.880 --> 47:47.560]  older correct me if I'm wrong because I know you talked about wanting to serve
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.000]  America decades ago really all it comes down to is wanting to have a free
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.920]  country for your children and grandchildren and that's where I want to
[47:53.920 --> 47:57.480]  come to this point next because I know you're smart sir and I know that you
[47:57.480 --> 48:01.320]  also though you don't dumb your message down but you keep it at a mid level so
[48:01.320 --> 48:04.800]  the general public and the establishment as well can get it but let's get down to
[48:04.800 --> 48:12.640]  brass tacks I routinely talk to the top generals special forces Pentagon
[48:12.640 --> 48:16.680]  currently out of the Pentagon CIA as I know you do and we'll just leave it at
[48:16.680 --> 48:20.760]  that there are a lot of people in this government and also retired who don't
[48:20.760 --> 48:23.960]  want to destroy the country they really know that we've reached the crossroads
[48:23.960 --> 48:27.120]  where the country is done as a third world nation within a few more years
[48:27.120 --> 48:30.680]  forget Donald Trump in four years if this happens we're done I mean we're
[48:30.680 --> 48:33.880]  talking about resurrecting the dead here we could turn it around right now as
[48:33.880 --> 48:37.280]  you've said properly you're dead on sir you're right we could turn it around all
[48:37.280 --> 48:40.080]  the actuaries all the numbers show it but it's got to happen the next few years
[48:40.080 --> 48:43.360]  and we're done right and there are globalists that want to have a world
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.880]  government a system run by select crony capitalist using socialism at the
[48:47.880 --> 48:51.800]  grassroots to make people dependent and I've talked to not just high-level folks
[48:51.800 --> 48:55.120]  that have been in government that are on your team but separately high-level
[48:55.120 --> 48:59.160]  people in government currently that say there's an internal war going on and
[48:59.160 --> 49:02.960]  that you're a manifestation of that I want to get anything inside baseball with
[49:02.960 --> 49:07.400]  you but I already know the inside baseball I know now from top people that
[49:07.400 --> 49:10.960]  you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you
[49:10.960 --> 49:14.920]  understand what you're doing is epic it's doors washed in level and you
[49:14.920 --> 49:19.400]  understand that office so I want to tell you right now can you speak about the
[49:19.400 --> 49:21.920]  war for the soul of this country that's happening right now and really tell
[49:21.920 --> 49:25.720]  people what's happening and commit to people that you won't Ross Perot under
[49:25.720 --> 49:30.520]  death threats and step down when you're in the lead two months from the election
[49:30.520 --> 49:35.160]  okay so let me just tell you Alex as you know I'm leading in every poll
[49:35.160 --> 49:39.200]  nationally in every poll state I'm leading in Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina
[49:39.200 --> 49:44.600]  the SEC Texas I'm leading in Texas which I love I love Texas you know we were
[49:44.600 --> 49:47.760]  there Mark Cuban called up he said do you want to use the arena user we filled
[49:47.760 --> 49:52.560]  it up in three or four days 20,000 people in Mobile Alabama we had 35,000
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.520]  people we had 20,000 in Oklahoma I'm so into this and I'm not into you know I
[49:58.520 --> 50:01.600]  could do other things that I would enjoy doing to be honest with you doing a
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.360]  dangerous mission we understand that it's not an easy thing but the key is
[50:05.360 --> 50:08.800]  make America great again we can make America great again but if you have to
[50:08.800 --> 50:12.440]  suffer through four more or eight more years of what's gone on in the past and
[50:12.440 --> 50:17.640]  you know what's going just we're being eaten away it's just eat it's eating
[50:17.640 --> 50:22.480]  away at our country and we can make in my opinion we can make America greater
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.440]  than ever before but we have to get going it has to happen we have to get
[50:26.440 --> 50:31.480]  going and you know when you look at the vision I said Iraq you agreed with me on
[50:31.480 --> 50:36.440]  Iraq I said hit the oil I said a lot of things that turned out to be true a
[50:36.440 --> 50:39.680]  hundred percent true and I'm giving credit I'm giving credit by some people
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.040]  some people refuse to acknowledge it you know they refuse to say no you've been
[50:43.040 --> 50:46.280]  you've been you've been absolutely on target so what I'm asking is though to
[50:46.280 --> 50:48.800]  speak to the crossroads we're at right now though because you've talked about
[50:48.800 --> 50:52.320]  it are we at a crossroads to decide whether this country's done or whether
[50:52.320 --> 50:56.240]  we go to the next level well I think this I think that it's sadly I think that
[50:56.240 --> 50:59.080]  if we don't get it right this time I think this is going to be the most
[50:59.080 --> 51:02.160]  important election our country's ever had I mean you'd have to say George
[51:02.160 --> 51:04.920]  Washington was right there you know the couple of pretty important elections
[51:04.920 --> 51:08.400]  right but this is certainly in the last in the modern era this is the most
[51:08.400 --> 51:13.200]  important election election our country's ever had if we don't get it right if we
[51:13.200 --> 51:18.760]  put another one of these people in like Hillary I mean she she's so corrupt she
[51:18.760 --> 51:23.200]  is so corrupt and she shouldn't even be allowed to run and frankly her greatest
[51:23.200 --> 51:28.680]  legacy she was a horrible Secretary of State if she's if she runs I think her
[51:28.680 --> 51:32.120]  greatest legacy will be that she got out of the email scandal that's what I think
[51:32.120 --> 51:36.360]  it'll be one of the greatest jobs I've ever seen of getting out of a scandal
[51:36.360 --> 51:40.760]  because General Petraeus and many others I mean their lives have been destroyed for
[51:40.760 --> 51:44.600]  doing 5% of what she did that's right she shouldn't be allowed to run but you
[51:44.600 --> 51:47.920]  know the recent Fox poll that just came down two days ago has me beating her
[51:47.920 --> 51:51.640]  head-to-head which is very interesting and very good and beating her soundly
[51:51.640 --> 51:57.440]  head-to-head but we have to get it right our country can be absolutely we can
[51:57.440 --> 52:01.200]  turn it around but I would agree with you if we don't get it right this time I'm
[52:01.200 --> 52:05.400]  not sure if you go another four or eight years with the insanity and the
[52:05.400 --> 52:09.000]  stupidity of these leaders I'm not sure you're gonna be able to turn it around
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.360]  anymore I think it could be Donald Trump the man in the arena his new book we're
[52:14.360 --> 52:17.720]  talking about the moment is exposing the fact this country being sabotaged by
[52:17.720 --> 52:22.400]  design specifically I don't want to bring up detractors and it's a question I
[52:22.400 --> 52:26.680]  had early on that I did more research and I understand that you really do want
[52:26.680 --> 52:29.480]  to save this country where your children and grandchildren live but let's expand
[52:29.480 --> 52:34.640]  on this there are certain pundits out there saying you played golf with Bill
[52:34.640 --> 52:39.840]  Clinton and so you you know you've you had to do business in New York so you
[52:39.840 --> 52:43.080]  said nice things about Hillary I get keeping your enemies closer when you're
[52:43.080 --> 52:46.040]  not you know in politics I get it I understand I think that's what you did
[52:46.040 --> 52:50.400]  but but tell us specifically and I don't think this now I've seen it I know
[52:50.400 --> 52:52.920]  you're for real you wouldn't be saying the things you're doing they're scared
[52:52.920 --> 52:56.480]  of you the whole system's coming on against you but promise us that you're
[52:56.480 --> 53:01.680]  not gonna drop out at the key moment keeping all the other Republicans out
[53:01.680 --> 53:06.480]  of you and then Hillary racist to the head or or Jeb Bush does because as you
[53:06.480 --> 53:10.080]  know folks are claiming you're a Clinton operative you know I've never heard that
[53:10.080 --> 53:13.360]  I've I've heard it actually a few months ago but I've hit her harder than
[53:13.360 --> 53:17.800]  anybody times 10 if you look at you have you have just here I was a businessman
[53:17.800 --> 53:20.760]  yeah I've only been a politician for five months I hate to use the term because
[53:20.760 --> 53:24.560]  you know it's all your station's but I've just been doing this for a very
[53:24.560 --> 53:28.640]  short period of time I was establishment you know I was like a guy like you would
[53:28.640 --> 53:32.720]  say Trump is total establishment and I was a big donor to a lot of different
[53:32.720 --> 53:36.160]  Republicans but over the years I've given to Democrats I've given to Republic
[53:36.160 --> 53:40.160]  I've given everybody because I had an obligation I was a businessman one of
[53:40.160 --> 53:43.040]  the magazines recently called me a world-class businessman the truth is I
[53:43.040 --> 53:48.240]  did I built an unbelievable company a tremendous assets tremendous not only
[53:48.240 --> 53:51.840]  that iconic assets very little debt tremendous cash flow it's a great
[53:51.840 --> 53:55.080]  company and by the way people now see how good when I did the filing everyone
[53:55.080 --> 53:59.520]  said oh I'll never file I never file it's almost a hundred pages long and it's
[53:59.520 --> 54:03.360]  an unbelievable company so I built it which by the way the reason I say that
[54:03.360 --> 54:07.320]  that's the kind of thinking our country needs but I got along great with Clinton
[54:07.320 --> 54:12.120]  I got along great with Harry Reid I get along great with everybody because when
[54:12.120 --> 54:15.560]  I needed them I didn't want to have argument I didn't want to have somebody
[54:15.560 --> 54:19.080]  say well Clinton doesn't want to lose her you don't get in mindless fights you
[54:19.080 --> 54:22.800]  move forward with your agenda but now you see America in trouble and you're
[54:22.800 --> 54:26.600]  saying that's all sideline now Donald Trump's not working for Donald Trump he
[54:26.600 --> 54:30.360]  wants to work for America yeah as a businessman you could have even functioned
[54:30.360 --> 54:34.640]  if you don't get along no I know yeah example in New York City is 95% Democrat
[54:34.640 --> 54:37.880]  I mean if I didn't get along with the Democrats I wouldn't have one I'll tell
[54:37.880 --> 54:41.200]  you I mean you did want the vice president you know a position it's come
[54:41.200 --> 54:44.920]  out decades ago behind the scenes I mean I know you're a Republican what about
[54:44.920 --> 54:47.920]  libertarianism what's your view of libertarianism and then I want to ask
[54:47.920 --> 54:51.840]  you who's your favorite president and who do you think your running mate might be
[54:51.840 --> 54:55.960]  folks think it's Ted Cruz well I think that libertarianism sort of interesting
[54:55.960 --> 54:59.200]  there are certain things that I really like about it but you know keeping
[54:59.200 --> 55:02.960]  government out as much as possible we need government for protection we have
[55:02.960 --> 55:05.600]  to protect when you look at these maniacs in the Middle East that want to
[55:05.600 --> 55:10.360]  destroy us and you know the problem we have today Alex is the weaponry if this
[55:10.360 --> 55:13.320]  were a hundred years ago I'd say forget about them let them keep fighting they've
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.800]  been fighting all their lives let them keep fighting each other who cares but
[55:16.800 --> 55:21.520]  the weaponry is so powerful and they hate us so much that we have to now
[55:21.520 --> 55:25.280]  protect so that's a big part of government so there's a certain common
[55:25.280 --> 55:28.760]  sense to certain elements and I do very well with the libertarians frankly you
[55:28.760 --> 55:33.000]  know because they sort of get it and they they get me but we need bigger
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.400]  strength that I think the libertarians really want and we need it and we have
[55:37.400 --> 55:39.960]  to have it we have to have it if we don't have it we're not gonna have a
[55:39.960 --> 55:43.360]  country if we don't have borders we're not gonna have a country as far as
[55:43.360 --> 55:47.280]  running mate is too soon to say I actually respect a couple of people that
[55:47.280 --> 55:50.400]  are on the stage some of them have absolutely no respect for their I mean I
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.640]  think they're not very good at all at what they do you look at what's going on
[55:53.640 --> 55:57.560]  but I have respect for a number of people that are on the stage with me I
[55:57.560 --> 56:02.160]  have respect for a lot of people that are throughout this country you know
[56:02.160 --> 56:05.720]  political people I'll pick somebody I think they can really be a great vice
[56:05.720 --> 56:09.680]  president ultimately has to be a great president because that's you know 90% of
[56:09.680 --> 56:13.480]  that function is you know if something bad happens they got to be a good
[56:13.480 --> 56:16.760]  president you have to view it from that standpoint and my favorite president in
[56:16.760 --> 56:21.200]  the more or less modern era would be Ronald Reagan I've always liked him and
[56:21.200 --> 56:24.520]  by the way he was a Democrat a lot of people don't know he was some of a
[56:24.520 --> 56:29.160]  liberal Democrat Alex as you know and he became a somewhat conservative I wouldn't
[56:29.160 --> 56:33.280]  say the most conservative but if somewhat conservative Republican make America great
[56:33.280 --> 56:37.680]  and he really did he wanted to make he had actually let's make America great
[56:37.680 --> 56:41.600]  that was his and mine is make America great again so there's a little bit of
[56:41.600 --> 56:45.280]  a difference but my son my son you know finally sold me on being a bigger
[56:45.280 --> 56:49.120]  supporter of yours and I liked you love Americana your peer Americana but I'm
[56:49.120 --> 56:51.880]  still you know was research but but my 13 year old son's really smart as a lot
[56:51.880 --> 56:55.440]  of research he he watches all the debates he just really loves you he is on
[56:55.440 --> 57:00.280]  cloud nine that you're here Rex Jones and it was his question you know which
[57:00.280 --> 57:05.080]  president was your favorite but but all time all time who's your favorite well
[57:05.080 --> 57:09.960]  all time I'd say Ronald Reagan shorter term I would say well you know you look
[57:09.960 --> 57:13.120]  at Lincoln you look at Washington you have to go with they were there the
[57:13.120 --> 57:16.720]  classics right Alex you know you think in terms of the great classics you have
[57:16.720 --> 57:20.160]  to go with the Lincoln's and the Washington's I agree as a man George
[57:20.160 --> 57:24.480]  Washington was badass yeah that's what they say I mean that's what they said
[57:24.480 --> 57:28.040]  he said they say he never told a lie let's hope that's true okay but George
[57:28.040 --> 57:31.400]  Washington was pretty good but we had some look we had some great presidents
[57:31.400 --> 57:35.400]  and we had some good presidents on the other side too in all fairness but we
[57:35.400 --> 57:39.120]  will hopefully be right at the top of that list we're gonna make the country
[57:39.120 --> 57:43.480]  so strong and we're gonna make it financially secure we can't owe 21
[57:43.480 --> 57:46.360]  trillion dollars because it's gonna be that that's my final question what type
[57:46.360 --> 57:50.440]  of an elite wants a clowered and piven bankrupt the country so socialists can
[57:50.440 --> 57:53.920]  run in and we all get handouts what type of an elite is that I mean you've been
[57:53.920 --> 57:57.600]  around these people are they mentally ill Donald Trump well we have to make our
[57:57.600 --> 58:01.480]  country rich again you know the other day I said to a woman to her she came up
[58:01.480 --> 58:06.000]  to miss the Trump at a big rally where we had 14,000 people and at the end she
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.040]  just used me and I'm you're signing autographs and stuff and she said mr. Trump
[58:10.040 --> 58:14.200]  I'm voting for you a hundred percent but are you this whole concept of making it
[58:14.200 --> 58:17.480]  rich it sounds so Chris I said you know what it might sound Chris but if we
[58:17.480 --> 58:20.920]  don't make our nation rich again if we don't take back our jobs from all these
[58:20.920 --> 58:24.680]  other countries that are ripping us and if we don't take back our money and if
[58:24.680 --> 58:28.920]  we don't you know balance up our budget at least get it damn close and soon
[58:28.920 --> 58:32.800]  we're not gonna have a nation anymore third world country Donald Trump you know
[58:32.800 --> 58:35.720]  I know you've got to go 60-second break I want to come back for just three minutes

[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.760]  brought up you know somebody that he wanted to think on there that I want to
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.800]  think on there he came in here a month ago he's been on all these big shows
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.080]  just an incredible guy I was aware of who he was a patriot fighting communism
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.960]  all over the world tell us mr. Trump about mr. Stone who helped get this
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:46.520]  interview set up well Roger's a good guy and he is a patriot and believes
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:51.400]  strongly in a strong nation a lot of the things that that I believe in and you
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.480]  know I see him all over television people like Roger's a tough cookie I will
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.080]  tell you that but people like him but he's been so loyal and so wonderful and
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.520]  he is the one he really wanted me to do this interview and I'm doing it and so
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.520]  we appreciate it Roger I knew he was but then I did more research on him this
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.920]  guy literally fought communist all the world ran big elections against the
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.680]  Soviet Union and in Latin America and Africa and Asia I mean it and I know
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.640]  he's been friends with you for a long time and advising you so again my
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.720]  respect level went up even more knowing that you're talking to real political
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.840]  operatives not not fake pundits that are on TV and that brings me to mainstream
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:35.040]  media I love the fact when I first saw it a few days ago they misrepresented
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.480]  they said Trump wants five million dollars then I read deeper you said give five
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.400]  million dollars to wounded warriors before I go make CNN 50 million that's
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.760]  what you make these shows but you know they took that same I said give five
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.200]  million I'm gonna want five million dollars that we're gonna give to the
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.200]  wounded warriors or the vets right which is the same thing as far as I'm
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.960]  concerned we split it up because they make it a fortune on these debates which
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.240]  never had anybody you know Fox had 24 million people they used to get like a
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.360]  million and CNN had the biggest ratings in the history of CNN and I won't take
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.440]  full credit but I'll take 99.9% credit so I said give me five million dollars I
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.400]  want to give it to the wounded warriors I want to give it to the vets and but a
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.280]  lot of people said Trump wants five million dollars and I said it right in
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.040]  the same sentence Alex I didn't say it like that's how I deceive I said I want
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.320]  five million dollars that will go to the wounded warriors and they would play it
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.920]  they even took the tape you know the tape is worse than the pen they can cut it so
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.400]  they said give me five million dollars and then they cut it nobody knows what
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.260]  am I doing I'm asking for money to be on a debate it's ridiculous no I wanted
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:40.240]  five million dollars to go to the wounded wars in particular and let's see
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.800]  what happens I don't know but you know the one problem Alex if I didn't go to
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.760]  the debate then you know what would happen they'd say he's chicken I mean I
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.520]  think I won every debate true I mean I saw one channel made like 40 million
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.960]  dollars off you being on there they should give all of it to the vets well
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.920]  they should give a lot more than five I'll tell you right now but you know the
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.840]  problem is if I say I won't do it then the people that I'm debating who frankly
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.000]  been very easy if you want to know that you can just correct them once you're on
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.360]  stage well the people I'm debating they'll say oh he's chicken he's chicken
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.520]  he's chicken you know that's that's the problem with that but it's hard when
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.200]  you're leading all the polls and then you don't show up to a debate and then
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.840]  they'll be doing numbers on you but I would love to see money go to the
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.200]  wounded warriors I think it's it would be great what about crippled America it's
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.480]  a number one you got a big rally tonight everywhere you go your crowd just get
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.000]  bigger I mean obviously you're probably gonna get the Republican nomination now
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.520]  wow and you're ready for the dirty tricks it one minute left Donald Trump
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.880]  what do you have to say about your book and what's coming up well first of all
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.720]  before the book is you mentioned one thing I had never heard that but I am
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.720]  in this to win it I am not in this to say oh gee I've done a really good job a
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.800]  reporter called up a very powerful reporter said how does it feel how does
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.840]  it feel I said it only feels because they said what we've done has never been
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.880]  done before politically you know I've been in the poll for five months since
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.520]  it came out I'm number one I said it's only good if we win if I if I don't win
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.160]  I've wasted a lot of time that's the way I've you said no no you haven't you
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:07.280]  haven't I said believe me if I don't win because we can't do anything to make our
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.600]  country great if I don't win I'll be watching television someplace it'll be
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:16.160]  forget it so I wrote a book called crippled America it's doing fantastic
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.600]  business I don't know if you can see that thing right up here but it's doing

[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.040]  and we know you know that thank you thank you very much Republicans like
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.360]  Democrats are quick to jump in with supposed solutions after a tragedy and
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.800]  the wake of the Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado GOP leadership is
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.760]  pushing legislation by Congressman Tim Murphy if passed they should call it
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.800]  Murphy's law because you know what could possibly go wrong if you decide to quote
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:20.240]  fix the nation's mental health system well here's what would go wrong with
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.440]  Murphy's law it would lower privacy protection and give states financial
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:29.520]  incentives to allow judges to mandate psychiatric treatment the Democrats
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.800]  meanwhile are trying to push a law that would ban gun purchases for those who
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.560]  have been put on the government's watch list secretly without knowing they're
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.440]  on without opportunity to confront the charges and the witnesses publicly in
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:45.080]  court as guaranteed by the Constitution so because of one man's act
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:49.880]  Republicans offer us political abuse of psychiatry and Democrats offer us

[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:44.760]  New York very much a city still in chaos. The phones are not working properly, the subway lines are not working properly.

[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.760]  Obama is the one that kills the US troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:40.760]  Obama is the one that put them in arms' way. Obama is the one using them as human shields.

[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.760]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote,
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:12.760]  the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.760]  In 2012, the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760]  And why did you not stop that?
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.760]  Why didn't you come forward before? What were you waiting for?
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.760]  Well, for you, Inspector. I needed you.

[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:56.760]  You know, my dad at 110% believed in this country growing up.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:01.760]  And my dad was involved in all sorts of different volunteer things in high school and college
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.760]  and even some clandestine things.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:11.760]  And then even after he'd done all that for this country, for no money.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.760]  The IRS came when he had a dental office and claimed all these back taxes that he had known
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.760]  and the IRS sat there in the mid-1980s.
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.760]  The Tone Agency.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.760]  Even Reagan couldn't stop what they were doing and said,
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.760]  we're criminals, Mr. Jones.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:35.760]  And so we had to sell everything we basically had to pay the IRS what they claimed he owed.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.760]  And this woman sat.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.760]  He brought in all his receipts, all his documents, his lawyer, and she said,
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.760]  we're organized criminals.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.760]  We don't care.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.760]  We're going to set you up in court.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760]  We're going to put you in prison.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760]  And he said, this isn't America.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.760]  And they said, no, it's not.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:53.760]  Well, you know what?
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.760]  I am America.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.760]  And I watched all that happen.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.760]  And I'm just one more person you've abused.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.760]  You're the criminals that infested our government and these corporations.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.760]  And we're coming for you.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.760]  We're one more person that has a vendetta.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:13.760]  A vendetta that will be paid over and over again against you.
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:19.760]  And it's only the beginning.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.760]  Now, we've got other huge news, not just Ted Nugent joining us,
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.760]  not just Donald Trump on earlier.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.760]  Joe Biggs.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.760]  As you know, I've wanted to go around to these reported Jihad radicalization camps.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.760]  A lot of them found about the State Department and other agencies.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.760]  And we have InfoWars, Investigates, American, Caliphate.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:45.760]  They're going to be gone for the next week plus in Texas, in New York, in Michigan,
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.760]  and in North Carolina and many other states.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.760]  This is only round one of this.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.760]  The training centers, the military training areas, the fenced off areas,
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.760]  where this is going on, what the locals think.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:03.760]  Joe Biggs is going to be on the first 30 minutes with David Knight of the fourth hour.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.760]  Then we will re-air in the fourth hour, the last 25 minutes or so.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.760]  The Donald Trump interview, David Knight will be on showing and quarterbacking
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.760]  and traffic copping that hour.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:19.760]  But I will also have Joe Biggs on with us tomorrow, on Thursday and Friday and Sunday,
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:25.760]  with Josh Owens and Mr. Zimmerman, who are there on the road with them right now.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.760]  But I want to say something to the viewers, the listeners.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:35.760]  This isn't hype, it isn't a pep rally that, hey, we can go beat that team.
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:40.760]  And we've, you know, lost eight of our 10 games and the other team's undefeated.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.760]  And I'm telling you, we can do it.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.760]  Come on, we can win. I don't do that.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.760]  When we're in desperate straits, I'll tell you and I have told you.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:55.760]  But unequivocally, undeniably, in every fiber of my intellectual, spiritual, political,
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:04.760]  but also warrior body, in every facet of my manhood and all the gifts and weapons systems God gave me,
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.760]  I know we're winning and the initiative is turned towards humanity.
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.760]  It doesn't mean we'll win the final war against the devil for his one hour of power on this planet,
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.760]  which is biblically translated to about a year.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:20.760]  But we win in waking people up when the great evil comes upon the earth.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:24.760]  And that's what really matters is the souls.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.760]  We're winning, folks. The hearts and minds are beginning to turn.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.760]  Some people are falling to complete ignorance, complete corruption,
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:37.760]  but others are really waking up to the larger universe and it's beautiful.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.760]  The fact that it's on the news, I don't want to quote him.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.760]  He's been on the show before, but a famous rock star sent me a bunch of texts last night.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.760]  I was already in bed at 10 o'clock, so I missed him, went to bed at like 9.45.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.760]  Usually he's got about one or two, but I went to bed early last night because I was really exhausted.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:00.760]  And I had some chicken risotto with the kids and I went to bed, but he sent me a text and he said,
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.760]  man, this whole narrative, without showing the text, let me just read it on air.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.760]  You guys don't show this.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:16.760]  Let me just go to the, he said, the truth, I mean, is finally poking through at least some version of it.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:22.760]  All I have to say, a general comment that the doubling and tripling down on the ISIS narratives
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.760]  and global warming is starting to unspool fast.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.760]  The headlines today are incredible and would have been unthinkable a year ago in mainstream media.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.760]  There's more said, but the point is they're being challenged.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.760]  Hey, you run ISIS, NATO.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.760]  Hey, you're buying the oil.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:43.760]  Hey, global warming is a tax to run a world government.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.760]  Here's your admission.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.760]  People are just taking what they say.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:50.760]  Used to nightline would go, there's no world government, only insane racists say it.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.760]  We're like, but your thousands of your own documents admit it.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.760]  I mean, literally thousands.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.760]  Shut up, racist.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:57.760]  Public, please read it.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.760]  Here, shut up, racist.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.760]  Obamacare, triple prices.
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.760]  Shut up, racist.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.760]  Hey, you admit you want the guns.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.760]  Shut up, racist.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.760]  That's all they got.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.760]  You know, Hillary Clinton's really corrupt.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.760]  Shut up, sexist.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.760]  You don't like women, huh?
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.760]  How do you respond?
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.760]  You're saying, do you rape your wife?
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.760]  Love my daughters.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:17.760]  Love my mother.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.760]  Love women.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760]  I'm in private company.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.760]  That's what I pretty much hang out with.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.760]  And then just to tell me I hate women because I don't like this criminal, Hillary Clinton.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.760]  That's outrageous.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.760]  You're not going to slap me around with those labels.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:33.760]  Say I'm a racist.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:34.760]  Say I hate women.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.760]  I don't care.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.760]  You're the political operatives trying to screw everybody over.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:46.760]  All I want is freedom, prosperity, transparency, private property, family, right to defense.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.760]  Let men be men.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.760]  Women be women.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.760]  I love this species.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.760]  I'm a fan of humanity.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.760]  Man, I know about our accomplishments.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.760]  And I'm sick of all these piles of crap getting our way.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.760]  And I want you out of our way.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.760]  I don't like you.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.760]  I never liked bullies when I was a little kid.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.760]  I don't like them now.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.760]  And I lost.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760]  No exaggeration.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.760]  I was thinking about it the other day.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760]  It was probably over 100 fights.
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.760]  I was 10, 11, 12 years old.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.760]  I lost with guys that were three, four years older.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.760]  But let me tell you, at a certain point in the time I was about 12 or 13, it didn't matter
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.760]  if they were three years older.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.760]  I kept pounding their faces in and jumping on them and ramming their head in the ground
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.760]  until they realized how the cops would show up.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.760]  Some might have blood coming out their ears and they'd say, my God, how'd you just beat
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.760]  up this 16, 17-year-old who weighs 230 pounds and you weigh 160 pounds?
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.760]  What's going on with you, kid?
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:37.760]  And I said, listen, they attacked me and I stood up for myself.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.760]  Sometimes those bullies, when I had their head knocking it in the pavement would ask
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.760]  the question.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.760]  And by the way, these aren't Ben Carson stories.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.760]  They're a lot worse than I tell you.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.760]  Everybody knows it.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.760]  Everybody's got a sixth sense.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.760]  I tell those bullies, I said, you wanted to hurt me.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.760]  Don't you get it?
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.760]  I don't want to hurt you.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:54.760]  I want you to get off me.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:19:02.760]  And I want you next time to leave me alone and to leave other people alone.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:06.760]  It's like, I don't want to plagiarize it, but I actually said that to people.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.760]  I had Ender's game when he kills the kid or beats the kid up.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.760]  And they said, why'd you keep attacking him?
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.760]  Because I didn't want him to come back again.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.760]  I wanted him to leave me alone.
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:24.760]  I wanted him to get off my back.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.760]  And the minute that good people out there decide to stand up against tyrants and stop
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.760]  being cowards is the minute this world starts being free again.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.760]  And the minute we don't back down is the minute we start becoming free again.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.760]  Stop backing down.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:43.760]  Stop bowing down to these petty thugs that get in our face and use our conscious and
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.760]  use our goodwill to bully us into submitting to them the name of political correctness.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:53.760]  These people are a pack of mind control criminals, and their era is coming to an end.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.760]  And it's going to get nasty in the fight.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.760]  But we're going to beat them with God's help.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:26.760]  Stay with us.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.760]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.760]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.760]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.760]  I've helped thousands, and I can help you too.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:43.760]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement, and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.760]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.760]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:55.760]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:58.760]  Or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.760]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I have an important message.
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:07.760]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.760]  But they're about to lose control.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:14.760]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:19.760]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.760]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.760]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:30.760]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.760]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.760]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.760]  This will affect us all.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:42.760]  I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:48.760]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first, you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:54.760]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to dollardanger.com.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:22:19.760]  Again, that's dollardanger.com.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:53.760]  Thank you.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:56.760]  I'll see you next time.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:31.760]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.760]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.760]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.760]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.760]  His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.760]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:49.760]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.760]  Don't wait. Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now for not just your sake,
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.760]  but for the sake of your loved ones.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:59.760]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:27.760]  Thank you.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.760]  Go tell that long-tongued liar.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.760]  Go and tell that midnight writer.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:36.760]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back fighter.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.760]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.760]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:47.760]  Thank you, John Cash.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:50.760]  Well, my goodness, crazies, let me tell you the news.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:53.760]  My head's been wet with the midnight dew.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:58.760]  I've been down on bended knee, talking to the man from Galilee.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.760]  He spoke to me of the voice so sweet.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.760]  I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sweet.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.760]  He called my name and my heart stood still.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:10.760]  When he said, John, go do my will.
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.760]  Go tell that long-tongued liar.
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.760]  Go and tell that midnight writer.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.760]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back fighter.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.760]  Shoot her later. God's gonna cut you down.
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:25.760]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.760]  That's right. They know it, too.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.760]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.760]  Run on for a long time.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.760]  Run on for a long time.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.760]  Sooner or later, God will cut you down.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.760]  Sooner or later, God will cut you down.
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.760]  It's hard to turn that off, as I said.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.760]  Well, you may throw your rock, hide your hand.
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.760]  Working in the dark against your fellow man.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.760]  Curious God made black and white.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:55.760]  What's done in the dark will be brought to the white.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:58.760]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.760]  Run on for a long time.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.760]  Run on for a long time.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.760]  Sooner or later, God will cut you down.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.760]  Sooner or later, God will cut you down.
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.760]  That's right. Have a cash.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.760]  Go tell that long-tongued liar.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.760]  We're about an hour and twenty-six minutes and have it done.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.760]  Midair refueling. We need fuel.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.760]  We're getting the fuel.
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.760]  We're energizing for full combat with the globalists.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.760]  We're attacking on every level.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.760]  That's only been beta testing, as you can see.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.760]  God's gonna cut you down.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.760]  And as the hour draws near
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.760]  for the destruction of our republic
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.760]  and the birth of a filthy, degenerate, anti-God world government,
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:42.760]  you're going to begin to see people resist at every level.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.760]  That's why we have a bunch of specials running right now.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.760]  In fact, massive specials running right now

[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.760]  that's ordered by the 18th in the lower 48

[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:21.760]  Secret 12. We've got 33% off DNA force.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:26.760]  We've got a bunch of different specials
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:30.760]  at infowarslife.com or infowarstore.com.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:33.760]  We have a free e-book a year in the making, man.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.760]  They wanted to do this a year ago, took a year, they did it.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.760]  I just feel bad because I don't promote it enough.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.760]  It's keys to survival.
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:44.760]  We've got Joel Scowson, Joel Salente, so many others
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:50.760]  on financial, personal, home, security, survival.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:53.760]  It's a great free e-book, infowarstore.com
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.760]  slash newsletter, sign up for it.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.760]  We send it out free.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.760]  We have the infowarst premium power pack,
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.760]  charges all of your electronic devices,
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.760]  has the power to jumpstart almost any vehicle
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.760]  with the included jumper cables inside,
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.760]  keeping your bug out bag, your vehicle.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.760]  Others charge 150 or more for packs
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.760]  with lesser specifications.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.760]  We bring the infowarst premium power pack
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:19.760]  for only $119.95, and it will sell out in the next week
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.760]  because we only got 1,000 of them,
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.760]  which is still how I got a great deal.
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.760]  We private labeled it.
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.760]  This unit is $160.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.760]  Units that aren't as strong are $140-something.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.760]  This is $119 because we private label it.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.760]  We can sell it for a lot less
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.760]  than when anybody else sells it, including Amazon.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.760]  It's the infowarst premium power pack,
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.760]  just private labeled so we can offer it to you
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.760]  at an even lower price on the contracts.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.760]  That's how stuff works, folks, to get around Amazon.
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.760]  You know, folks put these contracts in
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.760]  that you can't go below a certain price.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.760]  Well, we just go around that by private labeling contracts.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.760]  I'm just giving folks a little insider secret
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.760]  to bring you, take colloidal silver, silver bullet.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:03.760]  $9.95, I think it ends in a few hours,
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.760]  actually ends today.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:08.760]  It's $24.95 private labeled at Whole Foods,
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.760]  the exact same product, private labeled
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.760]  by the same manufacturer.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.760]  Well, we sell it for $19.95 usually, you know,
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.760]  and it's a big discount, but only five bucks.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:22.760]  Now, now it's discounted $15.995.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.760]  You cannot beat that deal.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.760]  This is a lost leader right here.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.760]  Silver bullet, infowarstlife.com,
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.760]  free shipping until December 18th
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.760]  on top of a bunch of specials.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:34.760]  There's a whole bunch of specials still running.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.760]  So, see them for yourselves and know
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.760]  when you buy these high quality game-changing products
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.760]  from us, you're not just getting a great product,
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.760]  you're also funding all crazy people.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.760]  I mean, we're committed to fight these psychos to the end.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.760]  We're rabbit dogs. Let's just admit it.
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.760]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:30:05.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.760]  Ebingoa declared bankruptcy.
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.760]  The $3 billion of taxpayer money
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.760]  that will likely be lost in whole or in part
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.760]  is six times bigger than Stalingra.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.760]  Green renewable mandates have brought energy poverty
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.760]  to the people of Spain,
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.760]  where electricity is triple what it costs in the U.S.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.760]  and electricity will become a luxury in the U.S. as well,
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.760]  if Obama is allowed to continue his crony climatism.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.760]  The Paris summit takes to accelerate the economic decline
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:49.760]  of the West, transferring wealth to developing nations
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.760]  in the form of green infrastructure.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.760]  But it's just greenwashing for crony climatism
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.760]  and global governance.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:24.760]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:02.760]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.760]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.760]  on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.760]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.760]  Just one of the key compounds, BiOPQQ,

[01:32:53.760 --> 01:33:07.760]  For every question they don't want you to ask,
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:11.760]  he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:15.760]  He is Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:30.760]  Under my thumb, the girl who once had me down.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:35.760]  By the way, in the third hour today,
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:38.760]  we're joined by Lord Moncton from Paris, France
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:41.760]  at the Public World Government Summit
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.760]  where they're going to arrest us for our speech.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.760]  They're going to take an ounce of flaming tyranny.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.760]  Their answer to us exposing them
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.760]  is to not deny world government now,
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:52.760]  but to go, oh, yeah, it's world government,
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.760]  and we're going to arrest you if you don't like it.
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:57.760]  So they are uncloaking.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.760]  That's what Klingons do before they fire.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:00.760]  They uncloak.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.760]  He was a cheesy star trek allegory.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:05.760]  And we're getting tattoos on the line right now.
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:09.760]  While we do that, I want to go to this report filed yesterday.
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.760]  He's got more in a whole other city today
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:13.760]  with his findings.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.760]  But here's the pre-report filed last night
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:19.760]  at infowars.com by Joe Biggs
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.760]  on investigating the American caliphate.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.760]  Here it is.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:27.760]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.760]  Now, we are on our first leg of a North American tour
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:35.760]  exposing the caliphate that has happened here in America.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.760]  Now, we have a number of locations
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.760]  throughout the country that breeds radical Islam.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:44.760]  That encourages, that will even pay for people
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:47.760]  to go overseas to train, to become radicalized,
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.760]  and then fight troops overseas to come back to America
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.760]  and carry out attacks.
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.760]  Now, one of the largest stories in the country right now
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:00.760]  is whether or not we as a country, as America,
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.760]  should allow Syrian refugees and mass numbers to be brought over
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:09.760]  in hopes that they'll assimilate, that they'll become American
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.760]  through and through.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.760]  Now, our government has openly come out and said
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.760]  that they have supported al-Qaeda,
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.760]  that they have given them arms, that they have trained them,
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:23.760]  and now we have a president who is openly supporting ISIS.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.760]  He won't even call them what they are, which is radical Islam.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:34.760]  Now, there are tons, tons of peaceful Muslims in this country
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.760]  and throughout the entire world at that.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:41.760]  Info wars does not push Islamophobia,
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:46.760]  but what we do not like is the radicalization of Islam.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.760]  People who have taken the word of the Quran,
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.760]  people who have taken that religion
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.760]  and completely blown it out of proportion to a radicalization
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:58.760]  to a point where they throw homosexuals off bridges,
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.760]  where they stone people to death for being raped,
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.760]  where they make women cover themselves
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.760]  and don't allow them to work
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.760]  or don't treat people equally.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:09.760]  We don't want that to happen here in America.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.760]  Now, I was just in Molenbeek, Belgium the other day,
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:16.760]  and that is an area that has been completely taken over
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:18.760]  by radical Islam.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:21.760]  It's considered the jihadi capital of Europe.
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.760]  Now, on this trip, we're going to go to a few places
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.760]  that are like Molenbeek in Belgium,
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:30.760]  that have large populations of Muslims
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.760]  from different parts of the country,
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:36.760]  from Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen,
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.760]  all over the world.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.760]  We don't have a problem with the ones who want to come over here,
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.760]  start families, get a job and be peaceful.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.760]  But what we want to expose is that double standard
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.760]  that's going on as well.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.760]  We have companies, we have different businesses
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.760]  throughout America that have come out
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.760]  instead of they will not open their doors to Muslims.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.760]  But then you have these places like Molenbeek
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.760]  where we went to in Belgium,
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:01.760]  where they don't allow myself to even walk around.
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.760]  I can't even go into a restaurant because of who I am,
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:07.760]  because I'm an American, because I'm white.
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:09.760]  That is what we have a problem with.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.760]  Is that right there?
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:15.760]  You can't defeat racism by having more racism.
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:19.760]  You can't ask for equality and ask for rights
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.760]  when you're denying other people those exact same things.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:24.760]  It just doesn't work that way.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:27.760]  So that's what we're here to do is expose that double standard.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:30.760]  We're here to investigate the caliphate
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.760]  that is starting to unfold here in America
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.760]  because we have open borders,
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.760]  because we have a White House, a president
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.760]  who allows this to happen.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.760]  Even though there's insiders in Washington
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.760]  who say that the attacks that happened in Paris
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.760]  were because of open borders.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:48.760]  So it's not racist to go, hey, we should shut these borders down.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.760]  We need to shut them down
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.760]  and then figure out a better way to vet the people.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.760]  Because the FBI says they don't have the ability
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.760]  to vet all of these refugees.
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.760]  Like I said before, many that are coming through
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.760]  will be peaceful people.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.760]  They will become Americans. They will get jobs.
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:06.760]  They will raise families and you'll never hear from them again.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:09.760]  But then you're going to have a few bad apples that are slipped through.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.760]  So that's what this whole trip's about is exposing that right here.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.760]  So stay tuned for the next few days.
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.760]  We'll give you reports from different locations
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:21.760]  across the Northeast and our way back down towards Texas.
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.760]  So stay tuned for more reports. Go to infowars.com.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.760]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:29.760]  That was Joe Biggs from an undisclosed location.
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.760]  He's going to be live in the fourth hour today.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.760]  They're going to six different Jihadi training camps.
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.760]  In fact, if you see that fence right there, he was at one last night.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.760]  That's where that was shot.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.760]  This is obviously not very safe to do.
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.760]  We're not announcing where he's at until he's left
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.760]  or where he's going next.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:47.760]  We obviously had Donald Trump on
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.760]  dropping bombshells in the last hour.
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.760]  And now, saving the best until last,
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:58.760]  we have the Motor City Madman with Stranglehold King himself.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.760]  Ted Nugent joining us for the next 20-plus minutes
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:04.760]  to talk about the state of this country, the state of this world.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:07.760]  Ted Nugent, I've got to say that I'd love to see you
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:10.760]  as the vice presidential running mate with Donald Trump.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.760]  There's a lot of bad stuff happening, but I can feel the energy,
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.760]  the reawakening of America, liberty rising.
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.760]  I've been very negative in the past and correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:23.760]  but are you not feeling the tectonic, explosive, volcanic energy,
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.760]  the rebirth of America beginning to happen?
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.760]  Or am I wrong, Ted Nugent?
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.760]  Well, Alex, you're on number one.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.760]  The truth is so glaring right now.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.760]  The self-evident truth, the common sense, the logic
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.760]  that you share with everybody on your programs
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:40.760]  and with your voice, I salute you for that.
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:43.760]  But, you know, here it is December 2015
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.760]  and the whole world sucks.
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.760]  America sucks less,
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.760]  but we've got a government, a media, and academia
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.760]  that are trying to catch up with Indonesia.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:55.760]  But let me tell you, Alex, just to make sure we stay on a positive note here,
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:59.760]  though we will delve into the horror stories that run amok,
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.760]  America sucks less, but during the hunting season in Texas,
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.760]  Alex, it don't suck at all.
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:10.760]  I mean, I'm bringing you effervescent glowage
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:15.760]  of a spirit-wild, backstrap jihadi celebration,
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.760]  but as I celebrate the good,
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:21.760]  I celebrate the good because America still has unlimited good,
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:24.760]  but it is our job, it is our sworn duty.
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.760]  If you have a brain, if you have a soul,
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.760]  you will be more like Alex Jones and Ted Nugent and the Hellraisers
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.760]  because our number one responsibility as we the people
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:38.760]  in this unique and unprecedented experiment in self-government,
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.760]  our job as American, job one,
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:46.760]  raise hell and demand accountability.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.760]  Remember the Alamo, remember Concord Bridge.
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:53.760]  We didn't meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea,
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:58.760]  be tolerant, and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.760]  We met them at Concord Bridge and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.760]  And I smell the beast approaching the door more and more every day.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.760]  So thank you for spreading the truth.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:12.760]  Thank you for spreading the logic and common sense.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:16.760]  But let me tell you, I'm not just going to give you a Ted Nugent ultrashine
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:20.760]  on what Alex Jones represents because I travel this country.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:26.760]  I've already shared 20-some hunting camps with working hard, playing hard Americans,
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:31.760]  people that still set their alarm clock and still dedicate themselves
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.760]  to be productive assets for a strong America.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:43.760]  And what you represent, Alex, what I talk about is not an Alex Jones Ted Nugent hunt.
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.760]  We presume nothing.
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.760]  What the families I share campfires with, remember, Alex, it's intimate.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.760]  These people don't hold back.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.760]  If Ted Nugent represents anything, it's that it's nothing, nothing is sacred,
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.760]  and you can unleash the beast.
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:03.760]  And when they express their beliefs about this criminal empire
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:07.760]  in the government of the United States of America, this freedom-hating,
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:11.760]  America-hating punk president in his entire...
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:13.760]  The globalists should surrender right now.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.760]  They have no idea that the sleeping giant is rising.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.760]  Oh, it's rising. That's my point.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:21.760]  These people still work really, really hard.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:27.760]  But as we've talked about in the past, the enemy isn't necessarily the ultimate enemy.
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:35.760]  The real enemy of America is lazy, apathetic, uninvolved, nonparticipating America
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:40.760]  who don't know their mayor, they don't know their governor, they don't know their senator,
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.760]  they don't know nothing.
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:45.760]  Those people claim they believe in the Second Amendment.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.760]  They're not even members of the NRA, Alex.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:52.760]  These people are rock solid in the liability column of America.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:55.760]  But again, as I shine the light on the bad and the ugly,
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.760]  they're still increasing good out there.
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:02.760]  Because more and more families, more and more hardworking moms and dads
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.760]  and just people that are in the asset column of America,
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:12.760]  they now recognize the curse, the self-inflicted curse
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.760]  that is Barack Obama and the liberal Democrats who hate freedom,
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:20.760]  who hate the Constitution, who hate the Bill of Rights,
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:24.760]  they don't believe in self-defense, they don't believe in independence,
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.760]  they don't believe in being the best that you can be.
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.760]  They are intentionally on a runaway freight train to weaken America
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:35.760]  and to reward the bloodsuckers while they punish the producers.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.760]  So I know I'm preaching to the choir out there.
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:39.760]  No, no, but I want you to elaborate.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.760]  How could Europe, how could Obama openly open us up to radical Islam,
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:47.760]  let him kill us, and then Obama goes to France and Hollande goes there and says,
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:55.760]  we saved you past global government carbon taxes to show the jihadis and Putin is exposing that
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.760]  Turkey is buying the ISIS oil.
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:00.760]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:07.760]  I mean, my brain is tested by the hour, not just occasionally, not just daily,
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:13.760]  by the hour what this president does, what this government does, what the academia is.
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.760]  What do they think they're doing?
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:15.760]  I mean, you're a smart guy.
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:17.760]  I mean, you really are, respect you.
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:19.760]  What do you think they're thinking up there?
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.760]  Don't they know that they're just wrecking the country and pissing everybody off?
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:30.760]  You know, Alex, I'm going to answer your question, but allow me to elaborate and get there.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:36.760]  I believe that the reason America is stupid, apathetic, uncaring,
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:41.760]  slovenly and allowed Barack Obama to become president,
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:47.760]  allowed lowest learner not to be shackled and imprisoned, allowed Nancy Pelosi to tell the people
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:50.760]  she works for that we don't need to read the document.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.760]  We need to sign it to find out what's in it.
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:55.760]  I go on and on with a thousand examples that would make you throw up.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:04.760]  But ultimately, it's because we didn't play old Yeller in our school system back when it was produced
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:05.760]  from kindergarten to 12th grade.
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.760]  There should have been an old Yeller day.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:10.760]  Then there should have been a Patriot movie day.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.760]  Then there should have been a Braveheart movie day.
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.760]  Then, of course, there should have been a Dirty Harry day.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:25.760]  But because we haven't taught self-sufficiency, the instinct to self-preservation and self-defense
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.760]  with the utility of the Second Amendment, that is why we are in the...
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:31.760]  I wish I could use the word cluster.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.760]  It's a military term, but I'll give you the first two syllables, cluster.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:37.760]  There is a cluster whack in existence today.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.760]  And here's the bottom line if we would have been taught old Yeller.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.760]  I don't care why he's foaming at the mouth.
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:46.760]  I don't care how he got rabies.
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:48.760]  He's rabid.
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:50.760]  Get rid of the damn dog.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:53.760]  When old Yeller brings the slippers, give him a biscuit.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:57.760]  When he foams at the mouth, you shoot him between the eyes.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:59.760]  Any questions?
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:02.760]  You're sad about it, but you've got to put him in the ground.
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:03.760]  You've got to do it.
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:06.760]  America, you've got to cleanse this country.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.760]  No, I'm not talking about shooting anybody.
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:12.760]  I'm talking about dealing with an outrageous condition
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:15.760]  that is painful and traumatic and frustrating,
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:20.760]  but if you don't face the beast, you're dead.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:21.760]  And that's what's going on.
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:24.760]  But again, I've got to tell you,
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:28.760]  I'm rather buoyant and effervescent as I speak with you today
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:30.760]  because I just got out of my treason.
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:32.760]  I just hung up a beautiful buck with a beautiful arrow,
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:34.760]  and my dog got fresh liver.
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.760]  I'm so happy I could have myself.
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:39.760]  But I'm writing my articles for WND.com.
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:43.760]  Where do you read tonight's WND.com piece?
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:46.760]  Where do you even my deer and deer hunting.com?
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:51.760]  I write these articles, and I weave in an absolute declaration
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:55.760]  of independence, an absolute declaration.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.760]  Yes, we must declare it.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.760]  We aren't going along with this.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:04.760]  Well, too many sheep exist,
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:06.760]  but I think more and more Americans are waking up
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:08.760]  to their sheepdog duties.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:13.760]  And I don't really care why Barack Obama is the enemy of America.
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:18.760]  I don't really care why Nancy Pelosi is a brain-dead vicious freak.
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:23.760]  I don't care how Sheila Jackson Lee is allowed to stay in town.
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:25.760]  That's why Harry Reid's a piece of crap.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.760]  I don't understand why Mumbles McRead is allowed to grow.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:31.760]  Can I entertain your listeners for just a moment?
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:32.760]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.760]  Can I do my best Harry Reid impersonation?
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:35.760]  Please.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:36.760]  All right.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.760]  My name is Ted Nugent, and this is just an impersonation
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.760]  on the Alex Jones radio show.
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:44.760]  But we actually have an elected official that sounds like this.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:48.760]  Well, if you can't do it, can you do it?
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:50.760]  I can't do it.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.760]  I can't do it.
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:54.760]  I can't pay his taxes.
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:48:03.760]  These liberal Democrats are some strange subhuman freaks
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:07.760]  that is obviously subhuman freaks both for-
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:08.760]  You just said on my problem.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:10.760]  You just said on my problem, Ted Nugent.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:11.760]  Ted, to interrupt.
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:12.760]  You just said it.
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:15.760]  How could we be ruled by such gibbering weirdos?
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:16.760]  That's what gets to me.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:19.760]  These people are pathetic known criminals.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:24.760]  If I didn't laugh, I'd probably throw up blood.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:25.760]  It's so insane.
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:29.760]  But the bottom line is, again, I don't care how-
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:31.760]  Well, I know how it happened.
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:34.760]  But I don't care why America got apathetic.
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:37.760]  I just need to sound the alarm like Alex Jones
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:40.760]  does every damn day and wake people up
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.760]  that if you don't participate by raising hell
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:46.760]  and demanding accountability from your elected officials
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:51.760]  on a daily basis, you are a green door welcome mat
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:53.760]  for Barack Hussein Obama
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.760]  and the Valerie Jarrett Communist Maniacs.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:57.760]  You're bending over.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:01.760]  If you're not standing up fighting the beast,
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.760]  you're bending over and taking it in the ass,
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:06.760]  and that's what liberal Democrats want everybody to do.
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:09.760]  But I gotta tell you, I keep saying, I gotta tell you,
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.760]  because I do get input.
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:14.760]  Right now, I have 20-some million Facebookers.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.760]  You should read.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:19.760]  I was up to 33.6 million Facebookers
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:21.760]  off and on the last few months,
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:24.760]  because I reek of self-evident truth and logic
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.760]  and common sense and the evidence to support it.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:29.760]  We are alive and well out there, Alex,
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:32.760]  but we haven't raised adequate hell yet.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:35.760]  And I think with Trump and Ted Cruz
[01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:37.760]  and what I'm hearing, some awakening
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:39.760]  by some of these GOP guys,
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:42.760]  now I'm not excited yet, but I'm truly
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:47.760]  getting to the point of being...
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:49.760]  We're at least in the game.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:50.760]  I agree. People are waking up.
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:51.760]  Stuff's worse than ever.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:52.760]  I'm not even saying we're winning,
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:54.760]  but at least we're not in a total coma.
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.760]  I'm just wondering why the socialist liberal establishment
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.760]  is so arrogant and so crazy
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.760]  in shooting down Russian airplanes
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.760]  that are bombing ISIS
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:05.760]  and getting caught buying their oil.
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.760]  I mean, Obama has been caught trying to set up a caliphate.
[01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:09.760]  It's true.
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:11.760]  He does want to overthrow this country,
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.760]  and I just wonder, what is our establishment thinking?
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:15.760]  I mean, I know they're not perfect,
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:19.760]  but they really want to put bags on our women's heads?
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:23.760]  Well, you know, I hear hope coming from Ted Cruz
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:25.760]  and hope coming from Donald Trump
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:29.760]  and I occasionally hear hope from Marco Rubio
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:30.760]  and Carly Fiorino.
[01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:31.760]  I think there's some great people.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:32.760]  I don't think the other...
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:34.760]  Yeah, the Michael the Archangel quite yet.
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:36.760]  I think Ted Cruz would make the best president
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:37.760]  we may have ever had.
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:40.760]  I'm not endorsing anyone, but I'm in...
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:42.760]  That's frighteningly intelligent.
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.760]  Yes, and he's constitutional.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:46.760]  He's not a Ted Cruz guy.
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:49.760]  He's a U.S. constitutional servant,
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:51.760]  which is what elected employees are supposed to be.
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:54.760]  In fact, they've taken an oath of bow
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:56.760]  to the U.S. Constitution.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.760]  They wipe their ass with it every three minutes,
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:00.760]  except some of my Republican friends.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:01.760]  I don't...
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:02.760]  You know, I don't even...
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.760]  I can't even think of any Democrats
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.760]  that really look like Americans nowadays.
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.760]  I'm absolutely appalled
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:09.760]  that anybody would put a D after their...
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:10.760]  That's it. That's it.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:12.760]  I mean, the Democrat leadership
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:14.760]  and their constituents now more and more
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:16.760]  literally hate America
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:18.760]  and have a death score to settle
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.760]  and want to mount our head on the wall
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.760]  like a trophy when this country
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:24.760]  and our forebears gave these spoiled ass bitches
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:26.760]  everything they've got.
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:29.760]  Yeah, I'm going to put in the most heartbreaking words
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.760]  that are available to us, Alex,
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:34.760]  and I want everybody to listen closely.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:36.760]  I know I'm just a guitar player,
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.760]  but I'm a father and a husband.
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:40.760]  I'm an asset to my neighborhood,
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.760]  to my fellow Americans, to my fellow human beings.
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:45.760]  I'm an asset to the environment,
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:48.760]  and we could get in detail that in another show.
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:50.760]  But for some reason, I am contacted
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.760]  every day of my life by heroes of the U.S. military
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:55.760]  when they're about to retire
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:58.760]  or when a flag drape coffin comes home
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:00.760]  and the family contacts me.
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:01.760]  So that's where my energy
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:03.760]  and that's where my perseverance
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:07.760]  and that's where my indetegable patriotism comes from.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.760]  You know what these U.S. Marines and these Army heroes
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:11.760]  and these Navy and these Air Force,
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:13.760]  you know what they're telling me, Alex?
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.760]  That they're retiring
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:17.760]  because they're not allowed
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:19.760]  to be Marines anymore.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:22.760]  They're retiring because they're not allowed
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:24.760]  to be soldiers anymore,
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:28.760]  and they are absolutely heartbroken
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:32.760]  and shattered that their commander in chief
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:34.760]  is the enemy.
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:36.760]  That's not my thing, Alex.
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:39.760]  Those are the words of heroes that have trained
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:42.760]  to defend and fight for the American,
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:44.760]  the U.S. Constitution and freedom.
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:47.760]  They tell me with tears in their eyes
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:50.760]  that they don't know what to do with the enemy.
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:51.760]  I can't believe it either.
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:53.760]  Why would the elite that already runs the country
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:55.760]  want to put it down the toilet?
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.760]  But you're right, we really are held by an enemy.
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:58.760]  Who is that enemy?
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:52:59.760]  What do they want to do?
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:01.760]  How do we stop them, Ted Nugent?
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:03.760]  Well, we stop them by galvanizing everybody
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.760]  in our family and our coworkers
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:08.760]  and our friends at church and school and deer camp.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.760]  We, the people who know self-evident truth
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:13.760]  and know that the Constitution is the outline
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:16.760]  for common sense, for freedom and individuality,
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:19.760]  and for God-given individual rights
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.760]  that were written down to a king or a desperate
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:23.760]  or an emperor or some punk
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.760]  to try to take them away from us again.
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:28.760]  If we know that to be true,
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:31.760]  if we actually believe that America is the best place
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:33.760]  and it's on a downward spiral
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.760]  with a commander in chief,
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.760]  then you absolutely must be registered to vote.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:39.760]  You have to communicate with your elected officials.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:43.760]  And in 2016, don't wait for Michael the Archangel,
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:45.760]  the perfect Republican candidate.
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:49.760]  If we don't vote Republican in 2016,
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:52.760]  we will become Barack Obama's dream.
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.760]  And that is a suburb of Indonesia
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:57.760]  where individuality, independence, and freedom
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.760]  is gone like a dodo bird.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:01.760]  Well, I'll expand on that.
[01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:03.760]  You write for worldnetdaily.com
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.760]  and Farrah said on the show that he was so sick
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.760]  of Republicans selling out that he thought
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:09.760]  he'd teach him a lesson in 2008.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:11.760]  He wasn't for McCain. I wasn't either.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.760]  And then Obama came in and you just,
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:15.760]  we can't relate with somebody
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:17.760]  that actually wants to bankrupt and destroy the country
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:19.760]  and hates freedom and hates Christians.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:21.760]  And then you come to grips with the fact
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.760]  that's really happening.
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:25.760]  And then you realize, I mean, they're demonizing
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.760]  Donald Trump because, okay,
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:29.760]  only hundreds of Muslims celebrated 9-11.
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:31.760]  So what?
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:33.760]  Hillary said she was in combat in Serbia
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:35.760]  and it's all made up, Brian Williams' style.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:37.760]  The point is, is that it doesn't matter
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.760]  what they say about Trump or Cruz
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.760]  or any of these people,
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.760]  we certainly can't support Bernie Sanders
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:45.760]  and Hillary Clinton. I mean, good God.
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.760]  Talk about nails in this country's coffin.
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.760]  I've changed some of my hardcore conservative friends
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.760]  from abandoning the ship
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.760]  by giving them this analogy.
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:55.760]  Your daughter is dying.
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:57.760]  She's on the island.
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:59.760]  You have to get the medicine
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.760]  to her across the water
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.760]  or she will die.
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:05.760]  Your best boat is gone.
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:07.760]  You have the enemy
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:09.760]  with the only boat.
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.760]  Do you or do you not
[01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.760]  get on that less than desirable boat
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.760]  to get your daughter's
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:17.760]  life-saving medicine to her?
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:19.760]  America is dying.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:21.760]  And whether the GOP candidate
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:23.760]  is perfect or not,
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:25.760]  it's the only boat going
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.760]  to the island
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.760]  that will get medicine to a dying country.
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.760]  And we got to quit with this
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:33.760]  demand for perfection.
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:35.760]  Now let me tell you, if it was John McCain
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:37.760]  which was a complete joke,
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:39.760]  he was a complete idiot.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:41.760]  And as much as I respect Mitt Romney,
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.760]  he acted like a complete idiot.
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:45.760]  He came to a gunfight
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:47.760]  He rolled over.
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:49.760]  He came to a gunfight with a crayon.
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:51.760]  It was embarrassing.
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:53.760]  He deserved to lose, except
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:55.760]  so many Republicans,
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:57.760]  so many independents said
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:55:59.760]  they wouldn't vote because he wasn't perfect
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:01.760]  and look what you got.
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:03.760]  You got that devil in your living room
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:05.760]  because Barack Obama
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:07.760]  slid in while you were waiting
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.760]  for Michael B. Archangel.
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:11.760]  Thanks for nothing.
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:13.760]  You said it, and Ted Newsom
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:15.760]  actually brought tears to my eyes, and that rarely happens to me
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:17.760]  when you talk about America's dying.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.760]  America is dying.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.760]  Those aren't words. This country is dying.
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.760]  It's dying.
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:25.760]  And then you look at other countries, there's not many to go to.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.760]  It's so sad, and it's being replaced
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:29.760]  by
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:31.760]  demonic, hateful scum.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:33.760]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:35.760]  Alex, let me give you
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:37.760]  another perspective that I'm really
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:39.760]  humbled and honored and privileged to have.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.760]  And that is on my Facebook
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:43.760]  and my communication. I get these texts
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.760]  and emails through my office all the time
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:47.760]  from people from everywhere around the world
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.760]  from Japan and Australia
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.760]  to England and Ireland
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.760]  and Belgium and France and Spain
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:55.760]  because the rock and rollers love the attitude.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:57.760]  They love strangleholding.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:59.760]  Well, your music is good as it gets, too.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.760]  They know that only a guy
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.760]  that kills his own food with sharp sticks
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:05.760]  and defies punk-ass peer pressure
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.760]  can write a song like Stranglehold
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:09.760]  and deep down in their sheep-like European butts,
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:11.760]  they know that there's a warrior somewhere,
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:13.760]  but they're not allowed to be warriors.
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.760]  So they love my music,
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:17.760]  and you know what they express to me
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:19.760]  at times every day on Facebook?
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:21.760]  I get comments from Belgium
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:23.760]  and all across the European landscape.
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:25.760]  Ted,
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:27.760]  we look to America as the last
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:29.760]  place
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:31.760]  for individuality,
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:33.760]  for being the best that you can be for freedom,
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:35.760]  for the American dream
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:37.760]  that only existed with a Constitution
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:39.760]  and a Bill of Rights.
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:41.760]  And, Ted,
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.760]  you're throwing it away.
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:45.760]  They know I fight, but overall
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:47.760]  they're throwing it away
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:49.760]  in the name of more sick days
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:51.760]  and more welfare.
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:53.760]  Switzerland and America
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:55.760]  are the last countries to fall,
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:57.760]  and Switzerland's falling to tyranny as well.
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:59.760]  We are falling.
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:01.760]  And what comes if we fully fall?
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:03.760]  What will they do to us, Ted Nugent?
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.760]  Well,
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.760]  they're going to have to trample the weak and hurdle
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.760]  to get the dead to get to me.
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:11.760]  I just got a new 300 blackout.
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.760]  You know, we could talk about fire power.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:15.760]  We could talk about...
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:17.760]  Ted, I know you got to go, but we got a real break for 60 seconds.
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:19.760]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.760]  Talk about the latest you're up to.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:23.760]  Final comments with Ted Nugent.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.760]  Back in 70 seconds after this break,
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:27.760]  TedNugent.com.
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.760]  I'm Alex Jones from infowars.com.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.760]  We had Donald Trump on,
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.760]  unleashed.
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:35.760]  Donald Trump is a listener, folks.
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:37.760]  That's the inside baseball.
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.760]  And that interview is coming back up as well.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:41.760]  Lord Bonkton coming up from Paris
[01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:43.760]  and talking to GCN.
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:59:12.760]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:15.760]  Save Mattica for Christmas concoctions.
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:17.760]  It's no wonder
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:19.760]  they can't focus and calm down.
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:21.760]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.760]  Worked with my team,
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.760]  we set out to find the best formula
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.760]  with the highest quality ingredients
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.760]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:31.760]  We worked with the leading manufacturer
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:33.760]  in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:35.760]  children to bring you the most affordable
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:37.760]  and powerful-calming formula out there.
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.760]  Introducing Child-Eat
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:41.760]  with herbs and calming extracts like
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.760]  Chami-meal and Lemon-balm,
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:48.760]  infowarslife.com. That's Childease exclusively at infowarslife.com
[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:53.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:05.760]  The Rock and Roll Anthem, Ted Nugent
[02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:10.760]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:13.760]  What did Thomas Jefferson famously say?
[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:18.760]  A true liberal, but a right-wing racist according to the left
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:21.760]  What did he say?
[02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:24.760]  A nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:28.760]  Well, you talk about a big mean tough sheepdog with eyes of electricity
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:31.760]  It's Ted Nugent. We got five minutes left with him
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:36.760]  I wanted him to be able to come back and comment on the state of the world and everything that's happening
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:40.760]  I'll quote a tell-it-to city's Ted. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:44.760]  A lot of good stuff's happening, a lot of bad stuff's happening, but
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:50.760]  Finishing up with your latest tour, what you're up to, what's happening in the world, where everything's going
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:54.760]  I would love to see you run for president, but I think it's a little late this cycle
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:01.760]  Who do you think a Ted Cruz or a Donald Trump should have for vice president?
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:06.760]  And if they ask you to run for vice president or maybe the head of the interior department
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:08.760]  That'd be perfect for you
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:11.760]  Would you be part of the government if folks wanted to get you involved?
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:15.760]  Because I know a lot of Americans that want to see you involved in the department of interior
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:18.760]  So they're not harassing hunters and homesteaders and others
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.760]  Well, thank you for that endorsement. I appreciate that
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:25.760]  As you probably witnessed on my Facebook with tens of millions
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:30.760]  We hover between 10 and 34 million Facebookers
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:33.760]  And as we get way up there into the millions
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:37.760]  It's in the 90 percentile that are asking me to run for president
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:40.760]  That's an indicator that things are really really bad
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:46.760]  Because the author of Wango Tango probably shouldn't be considered for the presidency
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:49.760]  Let me stop you. I was driving back from Dallas two weeks ago
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:52.760]  Big old billboard at somebody's ranch saying Ted Nugent for president
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:55.760]  Saw one in Arkansas six months ago, buddy
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:59.760]  It's everywhere and the reason is because they read my books
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:03.760]  They read my articles, they read my stories, they go to my Facebook
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:05.760]  They see what I stand for
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:08.760]  They listen to me on Ted Nugent's spirit of the wild television
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:11.760]  And they vote us number one show every year on outdoor channel
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:15.760]  Not because we kill giant bugs, it's because I make sense
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:18.760]  I am in the asset column of America
[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:23.760]  I would eliminate welfare because all it is is a carrot to dopes
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:27.760]  Who want free stuff and enjoying life
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:30.760]  The system's scared of American men, they're afraid of John Wayne
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:33.760]  You look out there for modern John Wayne, it's Ted Nugent
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:37.760]  Well, and again, thank you for that, but I'm a simple guy
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:39.760]  I live within my means, I save for...
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:41.760]  But you're not a slave
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:44.760]  And I would kill my slave driver
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:48.760]  I wanted to be a Jew in Nuremberg in 1938
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:51.760]  While the brown shirts were herding people on the trains
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:56.760]  I had to figure out a way to get that brown shirt and Nazi punk ass Luger weapon
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:02:58.760]  I shoved up his ass and I touched off a clip
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:00.760]  And I would have got a magazine
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.760]  And I would have got all the other Jews to raise hell
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:05.760]  No, I'm not knocking people who fell for it
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:08.760]  But I'm telling you, don't fall for it
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:10.760]  Learn from history
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:13.760]  I'm in the train
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:15.760]  I'm in with you brother, I'm going all the way, I'm not backing down
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:17.760]  We're trying to fix stuff peacefully
[02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:20.760]  If the global is down the road, they want to fight, they're going to get one
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:23.760]  Yeah, they want to fight, I welcome the Texas
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:27.760]  Even my good friend, the Detroit police captain
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.760]  The chief of police in Detroit finally admitted
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:32.760]  That the reason Detroit is safer right now
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:35.760]  Is because there are more citizens with concealed weapons permits
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:37.760]  And people don't like to...
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:39.760]  This is positive, the head of Interpol, Ted as you know two years ago said
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:42.760]  Armored body like Texas, so there is some good news
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:46.760]  Sure, and you know I saw Gutfeld one day on Fox on the 5
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:51.760]  He quoted that guy where self defense is the clear and present answer to danger
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:54.760]  And he actually said, who said that?
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:59.760]  The chief terrorist specialist from the UN or Ted Nugent
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:03.760]  Again, common sense, if you're unarmed and helpless
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:05.760]  You're unarmed and helpless
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.760]  What an embarrassing, irresponsible condition and choice that is
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:11.760]  Well, the answer to tyranny is straightforward
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:16.760]  Men like Ted Nugent and people like Ted Cruz, people like Donald Trump
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:19.760]  It's just amazing and the fight's on and it's beautiful
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:21.760]  Because we're going to win in the end
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:23.760]  This tyranny will only make it stronger in the end
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:25.760]  I know we're going to win Ted Nugent, everybody takes action
[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:28.760]  Everybody shouldn't feel like a responsibility to get involved
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:30.760]  It's an honor to be involved in the fight for liberty
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:35.760]  TedNugent.com, thank you for your, I know you fight 6-7 hours a day for freedom
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.760]  On top of all your other work
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:41.760]  So thank you Ted Nugent for your tireless commitment and your energy
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:43.760]  There's only one other guy who has more energy than I do
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:45.760]  It's Ted Nugent, Ted, thank you so much
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:48.760]  Godspeed Alice, everybody have a great Christmas season, a great hunting season
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:53.760]  Remember, stand up for what you believe in, raise hell or move to Cuba
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:55.760]  Ted Nugent's got what it takes
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:05:02.760]  Republicans like Democrats are quick to jump in with supposed solutions after a tragedy
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:05.760]  In the wake of the Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:09.760]  GOP leadership is pushing legislation by Congressman Tim Murphy
[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:11.760]  If passed, they should call it Murphy's Law
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:17.760]  Because you know, what could possibly go wrong if you decide to, quote, fix the nation's mental health system
[02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.760]  Well, here's what would go wrong with Murphy's Law
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:27.760]  It would lower privacy protection and give states financial incentives to allow judges to mandate psychiatric treatment
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:31.760]  The Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to push a law that would ban gun purchases
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:34.760]  For those who have been put on the government's watch list secretly
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:36.760]  Without knowing they're on
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:40.760]  Without opportunity to confront the charges and the witnesses publicly in court
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:42.760]  As guaranteed by the Constitution
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:44.760]  So because of one man's act
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:47.760]  Republicans offer us political abuse of psychiatry
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.760]  And Democrats offer us punishments from secret star chambers
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:53.760]  For more information, go to infowars.com
[02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:55.760]  I'm David Knight
[02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:00.760]  I want more candy, I want more video games, fly, fly, fly
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:07.760]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:10.760]  That was designed to smooth out and help children focus
[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:13.760]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control
[02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:16.760]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:19.760]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:22.760]  And are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions
[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:25.760]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:28.760]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:32.760]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:34.760]  That children would actually like and take
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:37.760]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:39.760]  That are safe for children
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:42.760]  To bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:46.760]  Introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:48.760]  Like chamomile and lemon balm
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:50.760]  And essential nutrients that taste great

[02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:57.760]  That's child ease exclusively at infowarslife.com
[02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:01.760]  We have been fighting this war tirelessly with you at our side
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:04.760]  Day in and day out exposing the ludicrous lies
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:06.760]  And criminal operations of the globalist
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:08.760]  And we're starting to see big effects
[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:10.760]  And the word is getting out
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:12.760]  The globalist want to make us dependent
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:14.760]  And as to politely and famously said
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:16.760]  An army marches on its stomach
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:19.760]  Ammunition, food and supplies form the backbone of any offensive
[02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:21.760]  Including the info war
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:24.760]  And our enemies admit they're losing the info war
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:26.760]  We are in an information war
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:28.760]  And we are losing that war
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:31.760]  With this in mind, we have held strong to our principles
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:35.760]  And the decision to refuse any money from globalist or government
[02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:38.760]  We are funding our crusade against tyranny the old fashioned way
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:41.760]  With pure free market free will capitalism

[02:07:55.760 --> 02:08:00.760]  In this battle for humanity
[02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:36.760]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasted worldwide
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:39.760]  We've still got an hour and 51 minutes left to transmission
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:41.760]  We have the fourth hour
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:43.760]  Hosted by David Knight today
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:45.760]  But Joe Bix in the field
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:47.760]  Investigating the American caliphate
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:50.760]  Jihadi training centers on record all over the country
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:52.760]  He's been out for two days
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:54.760]  He's already been inside
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:56.760]  He has to move on from each base before he reports
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:58.760]  For security reasons
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:00.760]  He'll be on in the fourth hour
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:03.760]  Donald Trump came on the broadcast
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.760]  I've been talking to the Trump camp
[02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:09.760]  Let's just leave it at that for the last month
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:11.760]  They are listeners
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:13.760]  They came here and visited us
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:15.760]  We talked to them
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:17.760]  They're on board
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:19.760]  They want to save the country
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:23.760]  Destroy the republic for a socialist, collectivist, crony capitalist model
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.760]  Donald Trump came on and dropped bombshell after bombshell after bombshell
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:30.760]  It is the cover of Politico
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:32.760]  Up at DrudgeReport.com
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:35.760]  Impeaching Obama will only make him a martyr
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:39.760]  It is already in newspapers across the country
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.760]  Just an hour or so after the interview ended
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:45.760]  Trump, Hillary's greatest legacy will be
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:47.760]  Surviving email scandal
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.760]  That story is up on infowars.com
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:51.760]  The full video of Trump on fire
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:53.760]  Will go up in the next 10 minutes or so
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:55.760]  At infowars.com
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:57.760]  And prisonplanet.com
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:09:59.760]  And that 30 minute interview
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:01.760]  Will air on the second half of the fourth hour
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:03.760]  With David Knight today
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:05.760]  If you missed it
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:07.760]  But it's big
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:09.760]  I love this DrudgeReport headline
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:11.760]  Because it's accurate
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.760]  China challenges USA in space
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:15.760]  And I went and saw the new movie The Martian
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:16.760]  That they had repeatedly psychologically
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:18.760]  Didn't physically vomit
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:20.760]  But I did
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:22.760]  Stumble out of it sick
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:24.760]  Was Russia has heavy lefters we don't have
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:26.760]  They destroyed the models of the Saturn rockets
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:28.760]  That are even better than Russian rockets
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:30.760]  In the 80s
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:32.760]  They just, oh we destroyed them
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:34.760]  Vernevron bronze rockets
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:36.760]  Better than the Russian heavy lefters
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:38.760]  We destroyed them sabotaging against the country
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:40.760]  And so we have to go to the Russians
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:42.760]  For their heavy lefters
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:44.760]  They're smart
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:46.760]  At least they got 190 IQs
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:48.760]  I mean good for the Russians
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:50.760]  Not against that
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:52.760]  They got the Chinese have copies of the Russian rockets
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:54.760]  That blow up half the time
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:56.760]  Half the time literally or more
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:58.760]  And I go see The Martian
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:00.760]  And it's all about
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:02.760]  It's all about how
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:04.760]  China did our space program
[02:11:05.760 --> 02:11:06.760]  And China will get us to Mars
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:08.760]  And the Communist Politburo
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:10.760]  And red flags flapping
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:11.760]  And then I learned Chinese Communists
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:13.760]  Are influencing so many Hollywood movies
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:15.760]  And TV shows in America
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:17.760]  This country is wide open
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:19.760]  This country has been lobbied
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:21.760]  By foreign interest into hell
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:23.760]  So is the UK
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:25.760]  Conquered by the EU
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:27.760]  And I don't think the UK is perfect
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:29.760]  Or England is perfect
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:31.760]  I don't think America is perfect
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:33.760]  But you know what we built the Renaissance
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:35.760]  We created the technology
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:37.760]  And I'm a fan of western civilization
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:39.760]  But I'm sick of the politically correct
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:41.760]  Attacking the West
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:43.760]  And let me tell you what's been designed to kill the West
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:45.760]  Let's go to the control room
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:47.760]  Shot with George Washington
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:49.760]  And Molan Lave there with our crew
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:51.760]  Let me tell you who they're coming after
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:53.760]  They're coming after the West
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:55.760]  And the Magna Carta 1215
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:57.760]  And George Washington 1776
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:11:59.760]  Back by more than half the British Parliament
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:01.760]  Until the King came and gave a speech
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:03.760]  They're against where the real freedom came from
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:05.760]  Because it threatens them
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:06.760]  And they want to put taxes selectively
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.760]  On UK
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:10.760]  And German
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:12.760]  And US and Canadian
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:14.760]  And Australian power plants
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:16.760]  While China and India and Mexico
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:18.760]  And 163 other nations are tax exempt
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:20.760]  That's discriminatory
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:22.760]  That's wrong
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:24.760]  And at the very tip of the spear
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:26.760]  For decades
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:28.760]  Advisor to Margaret Thatcher
[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:30.760]  Newspaper editor Ed Vinner
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:32.760]  Top critic of man-made global warming
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:34.760]  That's right, now they call it climate change
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:36.760]  Proving the sun is the main driver
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:38.760]  Of climate change
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:40.760]  Like proving the sky is blue but he proved it
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:42.760]  With the science
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:44.760]  Is Lord Christopher Moncton joining us
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:46.760]  Covering the Paris World Government talks
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:48.760]  That in the establishment's own words
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:50.760]  Is the greatest conflagration
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:52.760]  Of world leaders in history
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:55.760]  Pushing for world government
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:57.760]  And a new environmental enforcement arm
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:12:59.760]  That will arrest chief among them
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:00.760]  Lord Christopher Moncton
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:02.760]  Mark Moreno
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:04.760]  Alex Jones and others
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:06.760]  Imagine reading newspapers
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:08.760]  Openly calling for your arrest
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:10.760]  These are flaming
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:12.760]  Naked Salazarians
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:14.760]  That haven't been seen
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:16.760]  Since Adolf Hitler
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:18.760]  Throwed the earth in his booted feet
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:21.760]  We're alive in epic times
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:23.760]  He was blocked from the Durban South Africa
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:25.760]  Meeting a few years ago
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:27.760]  He skydived into the event
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:28.760]  And now joining us via Skype
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:30.760]  He skydives via the electronic web
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:33.760]  Invented by the West
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:35.760]  Into our studio today
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:37.760]  Joining Donald Trump, Ted Nugent and others
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:39.760]  We salute our knight in shining armor
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:41.760]  Against the tyrants
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:43.760]  Lord Moncton, thank you for joining us
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:45.760]  Well, what a pleasure
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:47.760]  And what an introduction
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:49.760]  I'll send you your usual hundred dollars tomorrow
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:51.760]  That was outstanding, Alex
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:53.760]  Many, many thanks
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:55.760]  And I've had to turn down
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:56.760]  One of the things that goes on
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:13:58.760]  At these conferences tonight
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:00.760]  I've been invited to a really wonderful party
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:02.760]  By the Collective Day
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:04.760]  Climatorealiste
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:06.760]  That's the French climate skeptics
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:08.760]  So that I could be on with you
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:10.760]  This hour to bring you the update
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.760]  Here from Paris
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:14.760]  We've had 147
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:16.760]  Three-minute speeches
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:18.760]  By world leaders so-called
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:20.760]  All singing from exactly
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:22.760]  The same tedious hymnsheet
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.760]  By a farmer who overran his time
[02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:26.760]  And gave us 14 minutes
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:29.760]  Of the usual lying platitudes
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:31.760]  About global warming
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:33.760]  But the agenda is ever more naked
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:35.760]  Exactly as you've just described
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:38.760]  It is crony capitalism to the nth degree
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:41.760]  And crony capitalism, of course, technically speaking
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:43.760]  That is fascism
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:45.760]  And it is at the same time
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:47.760]  A collectivist desire
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:49.760]  That everybody should be made to toe
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:51.760]  One scientific and political line
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:54.760]  And as you have rightly said, Alex
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:56.760]  There are calls here at this conference
[02:14:57.760 --> 02:14:58.760]  From the various fringe lunatic groups
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:01.760]  That people like me should be arrested
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:03.760]  Tried, imprisoned and even executed
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:05.760]  But daring to suggest
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:08.760]  That their climate change scam
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:10.760]  Is them that it is
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:12.760]  But we are fighting back
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:14.760]  We have held an alternative conference
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:16.760]  Here for the last couple of days
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:18.760]  Which I spoke yesterday, one of the opening speeches
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:20.760]  And I proposed an idea
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:22.760]  Which had been put originally to me
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:24.760]  By Professor Nick Glass-Murner
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:26.760]  The great world expert on sea level
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:28.760]  He says it's not going to rise very much
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:31.760]  He has established an international committee
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:34.760]  To bring back ethics to the earth sciences
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:37.760]  Called the International Geoethics Committee
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:39.760]  That has been launched at our conference
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:42.760]  And I have been asked by that committee
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:44.760]  To establish a fraud investigation team
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:45.760]  We are going to go after
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:47.760]  Just two or three of the biggest fraudsters
[02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:49.760]  We are going to gather evidence against them
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:51.760]  We are going to submit that evidence
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:53.760]  To a committee of professors
[02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:55.760]  And doctors of science
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:57.760]  So that they can review it thoroughly
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:15:59.760]  And make sure that the job we have done
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:01.760]  Is serious and fair and correct
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:03.760]  And scientifically true
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:05.760]  When that has been accepted
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:07.760]  It will go into the public authorities
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:09.760]  In various countries
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:11.760]  And that evidence will be submitted
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:12.760]  In a dossier which will bear the names
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:14.760]  Of those professors
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:16.760]  Who are going to support us
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.760]  And I have already had conversations
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:20.760]  With Congressman Lamar Smith
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:22.760]  A few weeks ago in Washington
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:24.760]  He of course is doing a similar exercise
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:26.760]  You've just shown that on the screen
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:28.760]  He's subpoenaing
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:30.760]  The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:32.760]  Administration of the United States
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:34.760]  For to find out how it was
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:36.760]  That they tampered with the temperature data
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:38.760]  And I have already had conversations
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:39.760]  About how it was that they tampered
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:41.760]  With the temperature data
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:43.760]  To turn the long pause in global warming
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:46.760]  Which their data set showed
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:48.760]  Until a couple of years ago
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:50.760]  And the satellite data set still do show it
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:52.760]  Now it's 18 years, 9 months, no warming at all
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:54.760]  And he is subpoenaing them
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:56.760]  To find out why they changed their record
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:16:58.760]  Just in time for the Paris meeting
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:00.760]  So that it would show global warming
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:02.760]  That has not in fact been happening
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:04.760]  Over the last two decades
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:06.760]  So we are all in our different ways
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:07.760]  Moving in on these people
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:09.760]  And surrounding them
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:11.760]  And we are going to take them
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:13.760]  To the criminal courts
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:15.760]  Because those who have lied
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:17.760]  And cheated and tampered with the data
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:19.760]  And said that their results are different
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:21.760]  From what they really were
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:23.760]  These people are fraudsters
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:25.760]  They are doing huge damage
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:27.760]  To the poor people of the world
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:29.760]  Who need fossil fueled electricity
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:31.760]  Coal fired power
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:33.760]  Can give them electricity
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:36.760]  At under $20 per megawatt
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:38.760]  It's the cheapest form of electricity
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:40.760]  Available on the planet
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:42.760]  We should be meeting in urgent session
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:44.760]  All the nations of the earth
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:46.760]  To work out how to give these nations
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:48.760]  That don't have electricity
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:50.760]  How to deliver clean coal power
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:52.760]  To Africa and Latin America now
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:54.760]  Straight away
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:56.760]  And this is something which would cost
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:17:58.760]  A tiny fraction
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:00.760]  And it would reduce their population growth
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:02.760]  To the working global warming go away
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:05.760]  But sir, would it also reduce their population growth
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:07.760]  To give them industrialization
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:09.760]  That is the truth
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:11.760]  I mean the kindest and the only way
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:14.760]  To stabilize the populations of countries
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:16.760]  Where there is overpopulation
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:19.760]  By which I mean the population is growing so fast
[02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:21.760]  That the nation can't support it
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:23.760]  These are the poor countries
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:25.760]  If you stop them being poor
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:27.760]  And they become so that everybody
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:29.760]  Has at least got a square meal
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:31.760]  And a roof over their head
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:33.760]  And some decent education and healthcare
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:35.760]  Then suddenly the population will stabilize
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:37.760]  All by itself
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:39.760]  And they admit that
[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:41.760]  So let me ask this question
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:43.760]  The only world leader out of over 150
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:45.760]  To say it's a fraud other than you
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:47.760]  House of Lords
[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:49.760]  The only person there is a world leader
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:51.760]  Saying it's a fraud as Putin
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:53.760]  Why do you think Russia has finally told the truth
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:55.760]  And come against it
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:56.760]  And Putin coming out
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:18:58.760]  And beginning to indicate
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:00.760]  It's still fairly carefully phrased
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:02.760]  You have to watch it
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:04.760]  He's trying to play both sides
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:06.760]  Against the middle a bit
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:08.760]  As they often do in Russia
[02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:10.760]  He's a good chess player
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:12.760]  But I think he's beginning
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:14.760]  To express skepticism
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:16.760]  Because he can no longer
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:18.760]  Make money out of this scam
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:20.760]  He suddenly realized that if the west
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:22.760]  Does go for shutting down all fossil fuel
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:23.760]  From Siberia
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:25.760]  Which are his major source of income
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:27.760]  It's made Russia once again a great power
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:29.760]  After the terrible economic collapse
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:31.760]  That followed the fall of communism
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:33.760]  That gas
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:35.760]  He can't sell it to us
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:37.760]  If we're going to say we're going to generate
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:39.760]  All our power from wretched windmills
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:41.760]  So he's suddenly realized
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:43.760]  That in having temporarily backed
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:45.760]  The global warming scam
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:47.760]  Because it enabled him
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:49.760]  He's putting Russia's throat
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:51.760]  Into operation to shut down nation states
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:53.760]  Which it is
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:55.760]  All selectively enforced
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:19:57.760]  Lord Moncton straight ahead from France
[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:03.760]  Ammo is getting scarce in this country
[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:05.760]  So it just makes sense

[02:21:57.760 --> 02:21:58.760]  Come and take it
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:01.760]  Something shocking just happened
[02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:03.760]  In a Coast Guard unit in San Diego
[02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:05.760]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:07.760]  And are now destroying the young bucks
[02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:08.760]  And head to head fitness tests
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:10.760]  How is this even possible?
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:12.760]  Turns out the old guys in this unit
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:14.760]  Had been part of a special test group
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:16.760]  For a doctor formulated fountain of youth drink
[02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:18.760]  Called Patriot Power Greens
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:20.760]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:22.760]  For many of the older soldiers
[02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:24.760]  That it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles
[02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:26.760]  And lack of energy a thing of the past
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:28.760]  Previously this drink was only available
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:30.760]  To elite military units
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:32.760]  But for a limited time
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:34.760]  The creator of Patriot Power Greens
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:36.760]  Has set aside a small number of free samples
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:38.760]  Specifically for our conservative friends
[02:22:39.760 --> 02:22:40.760]  But you must act fast
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:42.760]  Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:44.760]  Our supply is extremely limited right now
[02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:47.760]  To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens

[02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:58.760]  The following is an important holiday inventory
[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:01.760]  Announcement from IDStronghold.com
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:03.760]  As many of you have come to know

[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:09.760]  And actually do as they say
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:11.760]  And prevent electronic pickpocketing
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:13.760]  Of the new RFID chips
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:15.760]  Founding credit cards, room keys, subway passes
[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:17.760]  And more
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:19.760]  Last year due to the extreme popularity
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:21.760]  Of giving ID Stronghold wallets and clutches
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:23.760]  As unique gifts at Christmas time
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:25.760]  We ran out of our most popular styles

[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:38.760]  In electronic pickpocketing shielding
[02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:40.760]  From the most respected name in RFID protection
[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:42.760]  IDStronghold.com

[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:46.760]  Of these great gifts
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:48.760]  We are expecting another sell out season
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:50.760]  These wallets aren't available in stores
[02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:52.760]  So visit IDStronghold.com today
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:58.760]  That's IDStronghold.com
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:23.760]  I'm a big fan of RFID
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:25.760]  Like Lord Monk shed
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:27.760]  I don't tell the story to brag
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:29.760]  Because when I was a teenager
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:31.760]  I didn't know that I was one of the most popular people
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:33.760]  In school
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:35.760]  Because I wasn't into being popular
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:37.760]  I was into playing football
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:39.760]  And going after girls
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:41.760]  I didn't get into the debates about who was cool
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:43.760]  Who wasn't
[02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:46.760]  But I remember being say a
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:49.760]  Freshman
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:51.760]  I was a junior and the most beautiful cheerleader
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:53.760]  And people talking crap about her
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:55.760]  Because they were jealous of her
[02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:57.760]  And kind of joining in
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:24:59.760]  Now the next year when she was a senior
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:01.760]  And I was a sophomore
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:03.760]  And I was dating her
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:05.760]  I wasn't talking bad about her anymore
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:07.760]  And the reason I tell that story is
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:09.760]  What's wrong with this elite
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:11.760]  Because elites aren't perfect
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:13.760]  And elites come and go
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:15.760]  But I don't see a lot of cases in history
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:17.760]  Where you have an elite that are in charge
[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:18.760]  And they want to tear down the success of a country
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:20.760]  Or a culture
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:22.760]  Or a system
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:24.760]  Or an Anglo-American establishment
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:26.760]  It's one thing if you're out of power
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:28.760]  To talk trash
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:30.760]  But if the establishment's in power
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:32.760]  Why would they want to wreck the society
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:34.760]  When its wealth and freedom
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:36.760]  Made them even more powerful
[02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:38.760]  I mean look at Roman emperors
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:40.760]  British emperors
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:42.760]  Other emperors
[02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:44.760]  I mean a lot of them were altruistic
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:46.760]  They were a successful empire
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:48.760]  How did we get an elite
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:50.760]  That want to make us poor
[02:25:51.760 --> 02:25:52.760]  How did we get an elite that wanted to break up the family
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:54.760]  What do you call this group Lord Moncton
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:56.760]  As a historian
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:25:58.760]  I really respect your views why I'm asking
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:00.760]  I don't see a lot of cases in history
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:02.760]  Where we get sick freaks
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:04.760]  That want to wreck prosperity
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:06.760]  Wreck beauty, wreck strength
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:08.760]  Who are these people Lord Moncton
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:10.760]  I'll tell you who they are
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:12.760]  They are cowards
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:13.760]  The left which now lies
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:15.760]  About everything
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:18.760]  Is so vicious in its attacks
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:20.760]  On those of us who stand against it
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:22.760]  And are effective against it
[02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:24.760]  That those who want to succeed
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:26.760]  And go far in politics
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:28.760]  Have learned that on any matter
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:30.760]  Where the left has spoken
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:32.760]  They better keep silent
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:34.760]  Or the left will vilify them
[02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:36.760]  As they vilify the likes of you and me
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:38.760]  Such bully
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:40.760]  These are cowards
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:41.760]  The left
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:43.760]  We have to start as I say
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:45.760]  Prosecuting the back sides out of them
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:47.760]  So that they realize they can't get away
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:49.760]  With telling lies anymore about this
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:51.760]  To the cost of tens of millions of lives
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:53.760]  Every year of these poor folk
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:55.760]  In the countries like Africa and Latin America
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:57.760]  That could have electricity
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:26:59.760]  If we got on with it and made sure they got electricity
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:01.760]  Instead of which they are being denied it
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:03.760]  In the name of saving the planet
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:05.760]  From a non problem because the left
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:07.760]  Want to show who's boss
[02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:09.760]  People are cowards, they won't stand up to them
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:11.760]  So they already run things
[02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:13.760]  But they want to wreck the system
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:15.760]  Just to mount our head or what is it
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:17.760]  They want to wreck the system
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:19.760]  Because they know the moment they speak out
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:21.760]  As you and I speak out
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:23.760]  They will be the victims of left wing propaganda
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:25.760]  Just as you and I are
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:27.760]  And they don't think that they would survive
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:29.760]  Long in politics if they did that
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:31.760]  They are cowards
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:33.760]  And that's why they have drifted along
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:35.760]  With this climate change nonsense
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:36.760]  That Swedish women say
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:38.760]  They don't want to report rapes
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:40.760]  I mean it's crazy
[02:27:41.760 --> 02:27:42.760]  It's beginning to get like that
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:44.760]  Now if it's anything that the left is running
[02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:46.760]  And you dare to speak out against it
[02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:48.760]  And you become effective
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:50.760]  You become known for speaking out against it
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:52.760]  They will attack and attack and attack
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:54.760]  Until they've destroyed your reputation
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:56.760]  And the governing class has learnt this
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:27:58.760]  And is frightened of it
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:00.760]  This is a technique invented by Goebbels
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:02.760]  He used to do it to his opponent
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:04.760]  Yon Mihai Pachepe who ran the
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:06.760]  Desinformatia directorate of the KGB
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:08.760]  And they recruited a million
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:10.760]  Communist agents who were
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:12.760]  Western citizens
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:14.760]  Who were not known to be working with the KGB
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:16.760]  And their sole job
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:18.760]  Was to go around destroying the reputations
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:20.760]  Of anyone who opposed the left wing
[02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:22.760]  Communist party line
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:24.760]  And now the environmental communists
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:26.760]  Are doing exactly the same thing
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:28.760]  Indeed they are largely the same people
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:30.760]  Some of the older ones were actually recruited
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:31.760]  By Pachepe
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:33.760]  They're still in place
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:35.760]  They're still pursuing the communist line
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:37.760]  Even though communism itself has apparently collapsed
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:39.760]  So what has happened is that communism
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:41.760]  Is reinventing itself
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:43.760]  In the environmental movement
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:45.760]  Which it captured
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:47.760]  We listened today to Patrick Moore
[02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:49.760]  The founder of Greenpeace at our conference
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:51.760]  He made a very powerful speech
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:53.760]  In saying that he had fought
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:55.760]  Genuine environmental battles
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:57.760]  And won nearly all of them
[02:28:57.760 --> 02:28:59.760]  Until suddenly the organization was captured
[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:01.760]  By communists and taken over
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:03.760]  And then they began to get silly
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:05.760]  And they began going on about climate change
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:07.760]  And isn't that the biggest crime
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:09.760]  Is that all the real environmental problems are ignored
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:11.760]  That is of course a very serious crime
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:13.760]  Because there are many real environmental problems
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:15.760]  You look at the pollution in China for instance
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:17.760]  You look at the disease
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:19.760]  Throughout Africa
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:21.760]  Overfishing
[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:23.760]  And all that is largely dirt driven
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:25.760]  All of these things could be stopped
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:26.760]  On the agenda in Paris
[02:29:27.760 --> 02:29:28.760]  But they're not
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:30.760]  The sole topic is how can we set up
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.760]  A global government to make the non-problem
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:34.760]  Of global warming go away
[02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:36.760]  Because if we don't all agree to that
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:38.760]  The left will attack us
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:40.760]  Let's have a race to stay there
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:42.760]  I want to talk about what's happening at the conference
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:44.760]  That you're covering how we stop it
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:46.760]  It was five years ago
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:48.760]  You got the secret Copenhagen plan
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:50.760]  And blew them wide open
[02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:52.760]  Lord Moncton straight ahead
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:54.760]  It was six Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:00.760]  Three years ago
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:02.760]  Half of the sixteen billion dollars
[02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:04.760]  Dolled out to the department of energy loan guarantee program
[02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:06.760]  Was invested in companies that had gone bankrupt
[02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:08.760]  Or laying off workers
[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:10.760]  Or headed for bankruptcy
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:12.760]  But the department of energy didn't learn
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:14.760]  From its mal investments
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:16.760]  It then invested three billion dollars
[02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:18.760]  In a Spanish company, Ebingoa
[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:20.760]  Now, three years later
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:21.760]  The Paris Climate Summit
[02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:23.760]  Ebingoa declared bankruptcy
[02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:25.760]  The three billion dollars of taxpayer money
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:27.760]  That will likely be lost and whole
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:30.760]  Or in part is six times bigger than Selengra
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:32.760]  Green renewable mandates
[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:34.760]  Have brought energy poverty to the people of Spain
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:36.760]  Where electricity is crippled
[02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:38.760]  What it costs in the U.S.
[02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:40.760]  And electricity will become a luxury in the U.S.
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:42.760]  As well, if Obama is allowed
[02:30:43.760 --> 02:30:44.760]  To continue his crony climatism
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:46.760]  The Paris Summit
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:48.760]  Sixth to accelerate the economic decline
[02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:49.760]  To developing nations
[02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:51.760]  In the form of green infrastructure
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:53.760]  But it's just greenwashing
[02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:55.760]  For crony climatism and global governance
[02:30:56.760 --> 02:30:57.760]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight
[02:30:58.760 --> 02:30:59.760]  When cells become toxic
[02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:01.760]  They die early and aging sets in
[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:03.760]  No one has put together a formula
[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:05.760]  That focuses directly on brain health
[02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:07.760]  Nerve growth factors
[02:31:08.760 --> 02:31:09.760]  And optimizing your cellular energy
[02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:11.760]  At the same time

[02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:04.760]  Is the fact that the Infowars operation
[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:06.760]  Reaches more than 20 million people a week
[02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:08.760]  Worldwide with the message of liberty

[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:11.760]  Or by taxpayers
[02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:13.760]  It's funded by free will

[02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:52.760]  And remember
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:33:08.760]  Infowars is the operation that you built
[02:33:09.760 --> 02:33:10.760]  Defending the Republic
[02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:12.760]  From enemies foreign and domestic
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:15.760]  It's Alex Jones
[02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:17.760]  My ancestors on the Mayflower
[02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:19.760]  On both sides of my family
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:21.760]  Just wanted religious freedom
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:23.760]  Then in 1776
[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:25.760]  They wanted freedom to defend themselves
[02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:27.760]  And have lower taxes
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:29.760]  Then in the Texas Revolution
[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:31.760]  They didn't want to be ruled by Santa Ana
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:33.760]  Who came to take their guns
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:35.760]  And here I am now
[02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:38.760]  Following that genetic directive
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:40.760]  An obvious slave
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:43.760]  And I find it hard to believe
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:45.760]  That other people out there
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:47.760]  Don't have that same drive
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:48.760]  To send them to want to be free
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:53.760]  My love is in league with liberty
[02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:57.760]  And I wonder if people realize
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:33:59.760]  How horrible bondage is
[02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:01.760]  We live off the incredible
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:04.760]  Free market systems created in the Renaissance
[02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:06.760]  And that came out of the Magna Carta
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:08.760]  In Old England
[02:34:10.760 --> 02:34:11.760]  We weren't in war with England
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:13.760]  In 1776
[02:34:14.760 --> 02:34:15.760]  We were at war with tyranny
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:16.760]  And rediscovering the ideas
[02:34:17.760 --> 02:34:18.760]  That were actually formed on that island
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:21.760]  That's why 1776 is worldwide
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:23.760]  That's why I could speak at Bilderberg
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:26.760]  Only a few thousand feet from the hotel
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:28.760]  Where the Prime Minister was meeting
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:30.760]  And had 4,000 people in front of me
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:32.760]  From the UK and have them chant
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:34.760]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:36.760]  Because it wasn't some anti-British
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:38.760]  Or anti-Scottish or anti-Irish idea
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:41.760]  The answer to 1984
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:44.760]  That's a Soviet globalist system
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:46.760]  Is 1776
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:50.760]  All of us want freedom
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:52.760]  And now we face one of the greatest
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:54.760]  Evils in human history
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:56.760]  Openly in our face
[02:34:57.760 --> 02:34:58.760]  Lord Christopher Monckton joins us
[02:34:59.760 --> 02:35:00.760]  From Paris
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:02.760]  Where two weeks ago we had terror attacks
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:04.760]  Where Obama is now grandstanding saying
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:06.760]  Past global carbon taxes
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:08.760]  World government
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:10.760]  Strict rules give us strict treaties
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:12.760]  Or you're aiding the terrorist
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:14.760]  The very terrorist they brought in
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:16.760]  They really are Lord Monckton
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:18.760]  Playing on the hope that the public
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:21.760]  Is politically, economically, geopolitically
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:25.760]  Ignorant, illiterate
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:27.760]  Is that true Lord Monckton
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:29.760]  Or will they succeed
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:31.760]  Where do you see this going
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:33.760]  What are the main topics
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:35.760]  They have complete contempt
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:37.760]  For the very concept of objective truth
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:39.760]  That's the truth which is true
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:41.760]  Whether you or I or they
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:43.760]  Or anyone likes it or not
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:45.760]  And they, in nailing their clothes
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:47.760]  To the mass of the sinking ship
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:49.760]  Global warming
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:51.760]  Will find that in the end
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:53.760]  The truth will catch them out
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:55.760]  Those who depart from the truth
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:35:57.760]  Will always end up
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:35:59.760]  Trying to force the truth
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:01.760]  For the very concept of objective truth
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:03.760]  That's the truth which is true
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:04.760]  Will always end up
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:06.760]  Trying to force their opinions
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:08.760]  On the world through
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:10.760]  Dictatorial governing systems
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:12.760]  Because in the end
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:14.760]  The people won't stand for it
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:16.760]  And so they know
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:18.760]  They can only impose their will by force
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:20.760]  But in doing so
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:22.760]  They make themselves and the lies
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:24.760]  They tell ever more unpopular
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:26.760]  So the more they go down
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:28.760]  The frankly fascist root
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:30.760]  Which Obama mapped out in his
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:32.760]  And annoyed everybody here
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:34.760]  The more they go down that root
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:36.760]  The more certain they make it
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:38.760]  That their defeat will be
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:40.760]  Ultimately a crushing one
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:42.760]  And I think that the extreme left
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:44.760]  The totalitarian fascist communists left
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:46.760]  Call them what you will
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:48.760]  The people who think they know best
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:50.760]  About this and about everything
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:52.760]  And that no alternative point of view
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:54.760]  Should be allowed
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:36:56.760]  You should be ostracized
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:36:58.760]  As being politically incorrect
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:36:59.760]  And disagreeing with them
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:01.760]  These people are of the devil
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:03.760]  Let's be very blunt about this
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:05.760]  Because they have lost all respect
[02:37:06.760 --> 02:37:07.760]  For the truth
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:09.760]  And they do not care how many tens
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:11.760]  Of millions worldwide
[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:13.760]  Their lies continue to kill every year
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:16.760]  These people are of the devil
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:18.760]  And what we have to do
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:20.760]  Is very simply
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:22.760]  And very quietly
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:24.760]  Go on stating the truth
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:26.760]  Explaining there's been
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:27.760]  Only one third of the warming
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:29.760]  That they predicted in 1990
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:31.760]  In their first U.N. report on the climate
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:33.760]  It's simply not happening as they predicted
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:35.760]  That the sea ice in the Arctic
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:37.760]  That Al Gore said confidently
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:39.760]  In 2007 in Bali
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:41.760]  I sat next to him while he said it
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:43.760]  He said in 2007 by 2013
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:45.760]  There will be no ice in the Arctic
[02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:47.760]  And he was applauded by all the zombies
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:49.760]  And he said that there will be no ice
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:51.760]  In the Arctic
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:53.760]  And he said that there will be no ice
[02:37:53.760 --> 02:37:54.760]  In the Arctic
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:56.760]  And he was applauded by all the zombies
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:37:58.760]  In the room
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:00.760]  And only I said oh for heaven's sake
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:02.760]  Come off it
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:04.760]  That's not going to happen
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:06.760]  And you know it perfectly well
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:08.760]  And I was the lone voice of dissent
[02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:10.760]  Because the left have decided
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:12.760]  That they can tell any lie they want
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:14.760]  And the robots in the schools
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:16.760]  Who are the teachers there
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:18.760]  They just pass this on to the kids
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:20.760]  The kids are no longer taught to think
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:22.760]  That this is a new belief system
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:24.760]  I no longer call them alarmists
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:26.760]  I just call them believers
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:28.760]  Because this is a new superstition
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:30.760]  It's a belief system
[02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:32.760]  That they have very foolishly adopted
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:34.760]  But the left has made a huge
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:36.760]  Strategic mistake
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:38.760]  In making the climate their number one issue
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:40.760]  I agree with you Lord Moncton
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:42.760]  And by the way
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:44.760]  They've now had someone who I've met
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:46.760]  And had dinner with
[02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:48.760]  And there's not seem to be the sharpest knife
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:49.760]  Or quite frankly 70 IQ or so
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:51.760]  And that is
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:53.760]  Sean Penn
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:55.760]  He I believe is the useful idiot they use
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:57.760]  Who literally lead around by a chain
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:38:59.760]  I'm not being mean
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:01.760]  He just is so childlike
[02:39:02.760 --> 02:39:03.760]  A five year old level education
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:05.760]  And mind set and brain cells
[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:07.760]  He has said that those that design global warming
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:09.760]  Are a cult
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:11.760]  Fox News is a cult
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:13.760]  Well Fox News is more liberal than conservative
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:15.760]  The point is
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:17.760]  Well a cult is who says arrest us
[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:19.760]  Because we say climate change isn't man made
[02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:22.760]  I mean these people are a freakish group
[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:24.760]  Of the Salatarians
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:26.760]  Led by pitch men
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:28.760]  Who can hardly tie their shoe laces
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:30.760]  So they really are an embarrassment
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:33.760]  Yes they are
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:35.760]  I mean there's no doubt that the Hollywood lovies
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:37.760]  Have been reliably wrong
[02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:39.760]  On every major political question
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:41.760]  And one almost has sympathy
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:43.760]  With McCarthy when he tried to round up
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:44.760]  All the communists in Hollywood
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:46.760]  Because they're all still there
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:48.760]  And they all come out
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:50.760]  And they bleed ineffectually about how
[02:39:51.760 --> 02:39:52.760]  The Fox News invented the skeptics
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:54.760]  And that kind of Sean Penn's drivel
[02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:56.760]  They're the definition of useful idiot
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:39:58.760]  They are either use
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:00.760]  Here's what Lenin and Stalin
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:02.760]  Would have called a useful idiot
[02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:04.760]  There's an awful lot of them
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:06.760]  And these are not the fraudsters
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:08.760]  These are not the people you can put in jail
[02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:10.760]  For making up bogus science
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:12.760]  For those who are scientists
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:14.760]  Who know perfectly well
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:16.760]  That their own results tell them now
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:18.760]  That we're not going to get a lot of global warming
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:20.760]  We're not going to get any ocean acidification
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:22.760]  They're now, interestingly, beginning to admit that
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:24.760]  Even the communist rag new scientist
[02:40:25.760 --> 02:40:26.760]  Has just come out and said
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:28.760]  Oh we got it wrong on ocean acidification
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:30.760]  It's now quite clear
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:32.760]  That in the area where corals are flourishing
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:34.760]  The corals themselves
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:37.760]  Actually make the ocean more acidic
[02:40:37.760 --> 02:40:39.760]  And they thrive and survive in that
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:42.760]  And Patrick Moore gave us a very good lecture on this today
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:44.760]  They are wrong about everything
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:46.760]  These Hollywood lovies
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:48.760]  They're wrong about everything
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:50.760]  And we are gradually encircling them
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:52.760]  With the truth
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:54.760]  And this is what's going to happen to the left
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:40:56.760]  The left having said we know best
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:40:58.760]  Nobody can take any alternative point of view
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:00.760]  We're the boss
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:02.760]  We're in charge
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:04.760]  We control free speech
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:06.760]  We control free speech
[02:41:07.760 --> 02:41:08.760]  I mean how arrogant is that
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:10.760]  They will find they can't
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:12.760]  Because they're wrong
[02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:14.760]  And it's becoming almost embarrassing now
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:16.760]  The lengths to which they will go
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:18.760]  To avoid having any direct debate
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:20.760]  With any of us because they know
[02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:22.760]  We know more about the science and the economics
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:24.760]  Than they do
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:26.760]  And they also, the more honest ones
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:28.760]  There are a few
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:30.760]  They know perfectly well
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:32.760]  That they got this wrong
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:33.760]  And they never thought they would
[02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:35.760]  Let me interrupt you
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:37.760]  Because you mentioned this
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:39.760]  I've had high powered people
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:41.760]  Famous Hollywood folks
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:43.760]  Billionaires you name it go
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:45.760]  Alex you're right
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:47.760]  The earth climate changes
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:49.760]  It's the sun
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:51.760]  We're going into a cooling cycle
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:53.760]  It doesn't matter
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:55.760]  Isn't it good we're drawing attention
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:41:57.760]  In the environment
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:41:59.760]  Isn't it good we're setting up a global system
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:00.760]  Of agreements
[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:02.760]  Not about a carbon tax
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:04.760]  When China is exempt
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:06.760]  No so they now admit
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:08.760]  Okay it's a fraud but it's for a greater good
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:10.760]  That's what they quietly say at dinner
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:12.760]  That's right
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:14.760]  They're beginning to realize
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:16.760]  They've lost the argument
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:18.760]  So now they're looking for an out
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:20.760]  Because at the moment they are cornered rats
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:22.760]  They've dug themselves into this corner
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:24.760]  And we have encircled them with the truth
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:26.760]  And they can't get out
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:28.760]  Even though we got the science wrong
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:30.760]  We're still doing something useful
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:32.760]  No it is never useful
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:34.760]  To propose or take any action
[02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:36.760]  Based on a lie
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:38.760]  Because when the lie gets found out
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:40.760]  And you then say to people
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:42.760]  But we want to be the champions of the environment
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:44.760]  People are going to turn around
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:46.760]  And say you lied to us about global warming
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:48.760]  You might be lying to us about everything else
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:50.760]  We're not going to listen to you anymore
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:52.760]  So lying as a basis for action
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:54.760]  On the environment is not the way forward
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:55.760]  But the truth is that in the western world
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:42:57.760]  We have largely put the environment to right
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:42:59.760]  We've cleaned up the air
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:01.760]  We've cleaned up the water courses
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:03.760]  We've cleaned up the fishing grounds
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:05.760]  We've cleaned up the seashore
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:08.760]  We are now running a reasonably taught ship
[02:43:09.760 --> 02:43:10.760]  Environment wise
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:12.760]  We don't need to take all that much more in action
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:14.760]  To make sure the environment's looked after
[02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:16.760]  It is in the third world countries
[02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:18.760]  That as you've just so rightly said
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:20.760]  Have exempted themselves
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:22.760]  Or been exempted by Obama
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:23.760]  In China's case
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:25.760]  From playing any part in this
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:27.760]  Now China within the next 10 years
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:29.760]  Is going to be emitting half of all
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:31.760]  The CO2 that the world emits
[02:43:32.760 --> 02:43:33.760]  Now I say good luck to it
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:35.760]  We need more CO2 in the air
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:37.760]  I don't think that's a bad thing
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:39.760]  Point is that if you exempt China
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:41.760]  From agreements which are supposed to
[02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:43.760]  Reduce global CO2
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:45.760]  The one thing those agreements will not do
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:47.760]  Is reduce global CO2
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:49.760]  We also empower them to take all the jobs
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:51.760]  That the US release is to the extent
[02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:53.760]  Of saying that China is cutting
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:55.760]  Its CO2 emissions and is cutting
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:57.760]  Its use of coal
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:43:59.760]  It isn't, it's increasing its use of coal
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:01.760]  With every year that passes
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:03.760]  They have enormous numbers of coal-fired power stations
[02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:05.760]  Built and not yet even turned on
[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:07.760]  It's total fraud is selling discriminatory
[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:09.760]  I want to talk about the conference itself
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:11.760]  And take some phone calls
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:13.760]  I was just about to go to a caller
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:15.760]  But he hung up from Europe
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:17.760]  He wanted to ask you
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:18.760]  I'm talking to Kentucky and Phillip and Arizona
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:20.760]  We'll go to them in a few minutes at
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:22.760]  800-25-99231
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:25.760]  But what about specifically
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:27.760]  To get into their question
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:29.760]  What do we do about these
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:32.760]  These world courts and other organizations
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:34.760]  When they actually start trying to
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:36.760]  Find or feed people
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:38.760]  Or is that all just bluff
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:40.760]  What they're trying to do
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:42.760]  Is they're trying to find a way
[02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:44.760]  Of making western countries
[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:46.760]  Do what the UN tells them
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:48.760]  What this new global government tells them
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:50.760]  The court
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:52.760]  At least to start with anyway
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:54.760]  Is not supposed to have any power over individuals
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:56.760]  They wouldn't dare
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:44:58.760]  Frankly they would be very stupid
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:00.760]  If they tried to come after me
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:02.760]  For instance and say
[02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:04.760]  You are a prominent skeptic
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:06.760]  Therefore we're going to put you
[02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:08.760]  On trial for your life
[02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:10.760]  Because of your skepticism
[02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:12.760]  Because they know perfectly well
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:13.760]  And I can say where is your evidence for it
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:15.760]  And I can then take their evidence apart
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:17.760]  Show how it's been tampered with etc
[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:19.760]  They know that any judge worth his salt
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:21.760]  Looking at the evidence
[02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:23.760]  Is going to find in our favor
[02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:25.760]  Just as we did when we took Al Gore's
[02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:27.760]  Wretched movie to court
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:29.760]  When the British government tried to ram it
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:31.760]  Down the throats of his school children
[02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:33.760]  In 2007
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:35.760]  So I think they are bluffing
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:37.760]  I think they're trying it on
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:39.760]  I think they would love that court
[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:41.760]  They would put people on trial for their lives
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:43.760]  Daring to express dissent
[02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:45.760]  But they are terrified of going
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:47.760]  Head to head with us adversarily
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:49.760]  In a court
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:51.760]  What about the question from Dave
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:53.760]  Where both sides want the same green result
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:55.760]  What about Prince Charles saying
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:57.760]  You shouldn't have cars
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:45:59.760]  You shouldn't have air conditioning
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:01.760]  Like Obama said to Africans
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:03.760]  While he gets so much government funding
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:05.760]  What do you make of Prince Charles saying
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:07.760]  Save the earth, pay carbon taxes
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:08.760]  David said
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:10.760]  The moment Prince Charles gets on his bike
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:12.760]  And sells every Aston Martin
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:14.760]  And Jensen Interceptor
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:16.760]  And other fancy car he's got in his garage
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:18.760]  When he sells high grove
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:20.760]  I'll buy it from him for a pound
[02:46:21.760 --> 02:46:22.760]  And when he lives in a tent
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:24.760]  A yurt
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:26.760]  That's the fashionable thing among greens at the moment
[02:46:27.760 --> 02:46:28.760]  When he lives as he tells us to live
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:30.760]  Same with Al Gore
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:32.760]  Then I will at least respect him as a man of conviction
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:34.760]  While he lives like a prince
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:36.760]  And asks us to live like paupers
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:38.760]  I have no time for him
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:40.760]  And he is not fit to be our king
[02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:42.760]  I agree, sir, don't you get
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:44.760]  I mean, your view on this
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:46.760]  But doesn't the public get
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:48.760]  That you have people on Jared airplanes
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:50.760]  Red Carpets eating caviar
[02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:52.760]  Thousand dollar plate dinners
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:54.760]  Telling people don't consume, don't live
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:56.760]  It's so incredibly
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:46:59.760]  Hypocratic
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:01.760]  I mean, I just don't get
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:03.760]  To do something this arrogant
[02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:05.760]  What's wrong with these people
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:07.760]  It's not just hypocritical
[02:47:08.760 --> 02:47:09.760]  It's not just arrogant
[02:47:10.760 --> 02:47:11.760]  It's downright offensive
[02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:13.760]  It is expressing contempt
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:15.760]  For the ordinary people
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:17.760]  On whose backs they live
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:19.760]  This is a new aristocracy
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:21.760]  With none of the grace, elegance, handsomeness
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:23.760]  And wit of the world
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:25.760]  This is an aristocracy of black guards
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:27.760]  An aristocracy of bureaucrats
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:29.760]  Of bloodless little men
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:30.760]  And they all wish to have
[02:47:31.760 --> 02:47:32.760]  All the comforts of civilisation
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:34.760]  While denying those comforts
[02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:36.760]  I've just been reading
[02:47:37.760 --> 02:47:38.760]  Mark Twain's wonderful account
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:40.760]  Of a Connecticut Yankee
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:42.760]  At the court of King Arthur
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:44.760]  Where he gives a pretty
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:46.760]  Downbeat description
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:48.760]  Of the way in which the Arthurian court
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:50.760]  Treated the ordinary people
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:52.760]  With complete contempt
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:54.760]  And that is now coming back
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:56.760]  We're getting the Arthurian court
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:58.760]  Treats trying to set themselves up
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:00.760]  As kings over us
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:02.760]  And Prince Charles of course
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:04.760]  At the moment is in line to be the king
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:06.760]  Well as you know
[02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:08.760]  Any true aristocracy
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:10.760]  That didn't deliver
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:12.760]  Demanding that we make sacrifices
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:14.760]  That he is not prepared to make
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:16.760]  And demanding that we make their sacrifices
[02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:18.760]  When there is no need to make them anyway
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:20.760]  Sure, well Lord Moncton
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:22.760]  As you know
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:24.760]  Any aristocracy in history
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:25.760]  The aristocracy never even been in the military
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:27.760]  Tells the poor you should be poor
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:29.760]  I mean this is the most insane
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:31.760]  Aristocracy I've ever seen
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:34.760]  Well Prince Charles has done himself
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:36.760]  And the monarchy and indeed the aristocracy
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:38.760]  Untold harm
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:40.760]  By bleeding on ignorantly about this
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:42.760]  He's not a very bright lad
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:44.760]  He's not the brightest shilling in the pile
[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:46.760]  And his trouble is
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:48.760]  That he thinks he's studied this
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:50.760]  And of course he simply has no scientific knowledge
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:52.760]  Most of the British governing class don't
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:53.760]  And I'm rather rare in that respect
[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:55.760]  Because I've taught myself enough science
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:48:57.760]  To find my way around this
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:48:59.760]  And find where the lies are
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:01.760]  He is incapable of doing that
[02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:03.760]  And he's way out of his depth
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:05.760]  He is able to make a very good speech
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:07.760]  I've seen him at St. James's Palace
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:09.760]  Speaking for an hour without notes on this subject
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:11.760]  He's very passionate about it
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:13.760]  But the trouble is the content is totally empty
[02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:15.760]  He knows absolutely
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:17.760]  He's able to regurgitate horse crap
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:19.760]  John in Australia on the air with Lord Moncton
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:21.760]  Go ahead
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:24.760]  Hello Alex and Christopher
[02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:26.760]  Welcome, go ahead John
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:29.760]  Yeah, good to hear from you two
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:32.760]  Yeah, I used to believe in this global warming
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:34.760]  Because I got scared into it
[02:49:35.760 --> 02:49:36.760]  And I was panic stricken
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:38.760]  And then I started doing my own research
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:40.760]  And I watched lots and lots of videos
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:42.760]  Of you Lord Moncton
[02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:44.760]  And I found it all to be
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:46.760]  The global warming is nothing but a hope
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:48.760]  It's just a money making scheme
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:50.760]  And you've got Al Gore
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:52.760]  Who's saying about all this pollution
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:54.760]  And he gets in a jet
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:49:56.760]  And he flies all over the world
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:49:58.760]  It's hypocrisy
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:01.760]  They don't even practice what they preach
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:03.760]  They know it's a fraud
[02:50:04.760 --> 02:50:05.760]  Very good word
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:07.760]  Not only is he a hypocrite
[02:50:08.760 --> 02:50:09.760]  He's a liar
[02:50:10.760 --> 02:50:11.760]  Because when he came to Gibraltar
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:13.760]  For a debate
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:15.760]  At the last moment and just gave a talk
[02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:17.760]  In the name of the government there
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:19.760]  They paid him $300,000 to do it
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:21.760]  And they paid his private jet expenses
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:23.760]  While announcing that he had flown in
[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:25.760]  On a British Airways flight
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:27.760]  That didn't even exist
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:29.760]  And we caught him out in that lie
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:31.760]  And exposed him on national television
[02:50:32.760 --> 02:50:33.760]  So he is going around flying in private jets
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:35.760]  But he knows now that the best thing
[02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:37.760]  Is to pretend that he's not flying in on a private jet
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:39.760]  And so we had the airport watch
[02:50:40.760 --> 02:50:41.760]  To see how he flew out
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:42.760]  On a private jet as well
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:44.760]  And this is what's going on
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:46.760]  They are now living a lie
[02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:48.760]  They're telling us we've got to cut down
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:50.760]  And I commend you sir
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:53.760]  For having not just stayed frightened
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:55.760]  But gone and done your own research
[02:50:56.760 --> 02:50:58.760]  So as to find out whether people were telling the truth
[02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:00.760]  Because in the end
[02:51:01.760 --> 02:51:02.760]  That is how this scam is going to come to an end
[02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:04.760]  When enough people have thought this through for themselves
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:06.760]  They don't believe what they're told by their teachers
[02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:08.760]  They don't believe what they're told by governments
[02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:10.760]  They certainly don't believe what they're told by the likes of Prince Charles
[02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:12.760]  And Al Gore who are both contemptible
[02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:14.760]  For living high on the hog
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:16.760]  And asking us to live like paupers
[02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:18.760]  And these people are wrong
[02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:21.760]  And you have found out that they're wrong
[02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:23.760]  And you've done so just by going and looking back
[02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:25.760]  I agree, I agree
[02:51:26.760 --> 02:51:27.760]  John and Australia, go ahead and finish your
[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:29.760]  Any other comments from Lord Moncton
[02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:32.760]  Yeah, well I just like to thank you both
[02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:34.760]  Thank you, Christopher
[02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:36.760]  Because without people like you and Alex
[02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:39.760]  We would just be remaining dumb-down zombies
[02:51:40.760 --> 02:51:41.760]  Well brother thank you
[02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:43.760]  Don't thank me though
[02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:45.760]  We're all in this together
[02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:47.760]  I mean we're all in this fraud
[02:51:48.760 --> 02:51:49.760]  We're all together
[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:51.760]  Philip in Arizona, you're on the air with Christopher Moncton
[02:51:52.760 --> 02:51:53.760]  Go ahead
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:51:55.760]  Good afternoon
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:51:57.760]  I was recently carefully reading the text of an Obama speech
[02:51:58.760 --> 02:51:59.760]  From 2012 to the United Nations
[02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:01.760]  That speech is the source of his quote
[02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:04.760]  The future must not belong to those who slander
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:06.760]  The name of the prophet of Allah
[02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:09.760]  As I was reading the text it occurred to me
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:12.760]  And the question is do you agree
[02:52:13.760 --> 02:52:15.760]  That one of the things he's really trying to do
[02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:17.760]  Is to unify the Muslim world
[02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:20.760]  Specifically heal the rift between Shia and Sunni
[02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:22.760]  Sure is that for Moncton or me
[02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:24.760]  Because I'll just say I never believed this
[02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:26.760]  But it's true now
[02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:28.760]  Obama is trying to create some weird
[02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:30.760]  Sunni caliphate
[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:32.760]  And it's just totally insane
[02:52:32.760 --> 02:52:34.760]  I can't believe the elite would allow this Lord Moncton
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:37.760]  I think that that is a very shrewd remark
[02:52:38.760 --> 02:52:40.760]  Obama has talked of my Muslim faith
[02:52:41.760 --> 02:52:44.760]  And I was very suspicious of the whole reverent right affair
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:46.760]  I thought that the main purpose of that affair
[02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:48.760]  Was to make it look as though
[02:52:49.760 --> 02:52:50.760]  Obama was a Christian worshipper
[02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:52.760]  And we all know perfectly well that he's a Muslim
[02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:54.760]  So I think that what's happened there
[02:52:55.760 --> 02:52:56.760]  Is that he is indeed using his office
[02:52:57.760 --> 02:52:58.760]  Or abusing his office
[02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:00.760]  To advance the Muslims
[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:01.760]  And he's coming dangerously close
[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:03.760]  To advancing the course of the terrorists too
[02:53:04.760 --> 02:53:05.760]  And I think there is
[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:07.760]  I think he'll be quite lucky not to be impeached
[02:53:08.760 --> 02:53:09.760]  I agree
[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:11.760]  On Trump is saying that we won't impeach
[02:53:12.760 --> 02:53:13.760]  I agree Lord Moncton
[02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:15.760]  But it's hard for me to even believe though
[02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:17.760]  It's happening that he's worth Turkey
[02:53:18.760 --> 02:53:19.760]  Shipping the oil
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:21.760]  Protecting ISIS
[02:53:22.760 --> 02:53:23.760]  I can't believe our elite would allow a president
[02:53:24.760 --> 02:53:25.760]  To openly back Al Qaeda
[02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:27.760]  But he's doing it
[02:53:27.760 --> 02:53:29.760]  And I cannot compute like Robbie the Robot
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:31.760]  I have smoke coming out of my gears
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:34.760]  This is insane
[02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:36.760]  It is insane
[02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:38.760]  And the insanity is that the so silent
[02:53:39.760 --> 02:53:40.760]  Is the establishment in the face
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:43.760]  Of this outrageous attempt by Obama
[02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:45.760]  To align himself with the terrorists
[02:53:46.760 --> 02:53:47.760]  By refusing point blank
[02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:49.760]  Time and time and time and time again
[02:53:50.760 --> 02:53:51.760]  Ever to use the name of Islam
[02:53:52.760 --> 02:53:53.760]  In connection with the name of terrorists
[02:53:54.760 --> 02:53:55.760]  When 98% of all terrorists
[02:53:55.760 --> 02:53:56.760]  Act over the last 25 years
[02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:58.760]  Have been perpetrated worldwide
[02:53:59.760 --> 02:54:00.760]  Have been perpetrated in the name of Allah
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:02.760]  And he won't say this
[02:54:03.760 --> 02:54:04.760]  And he won't say to the Muslim world
[02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:06.760]  Our Muslim friends, our Muslim brothers
[02:54:07.760 --> 02:54:08.760]  They are our brothers too
[02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:10.760]  We should not hate every Muslim
[02:54:11.760 --> 02:54:12.760]  I agree, I don't hate Muslims
[02:54:13.760 --> 02:54:14.760]  But my God, thank you
[02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:16.760]  Civilization for us from the 9th to the 12th centuries
[02:54:17.760 --> 02:54:18.760]  When we were messing around in the dark ages
[02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:20.760]  And they were the leading lights of civilization
[02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:22.760]  They preserved the great classical texts
[02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:24.760]  That I studied at Cambridge of Greece and Rome
[02:54:25.760 --> 02:54:26.760]  When we had no interest in them
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:28.760]  They kept all that for us
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:30.760]  These are people to whom we should look up
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:32.760]  So how have they degenerated?
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:34.760]  Because you're right, they've been a leading light
[02:54:35.760 --> 02:54:38.760]  And what we should be doing as world leaders
[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:41.760]  Is trying to lead Islam back
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:44.760]  To the era of scholarship and learning
[02:54:45.760 --> 02:54:47.760]  Rather than of the sword
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:49.760]  And book burning
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:50.760]  And the spiritual sword verses
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:52.760]  And get back to the learning for which Islam
[02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:54.760]  Was once renowned worldwide
[02:54:55.760 --> 02:54:56.760]  And Obama in that degree
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:54:58.760]  Has absolutely nothing to offer us
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:01.760]  He will prove to have been one of the most damaging
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:03.760]  And otherwise irrelevant presidents
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:05.760]  That's my question
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:07.760]  Why would the elite back radical book burning
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:09.760]  Woman enslaving Islam
[02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:11.760]  When there's so many great forms of it
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:13.760]  As you historically point out
[02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:15.760]  Go ahead Lord Bonkton, thank you Philip
[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:17.760]  The reason is very, very straightforward
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:18.760]  And that is that the Islam
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:21.760]  In its present manifestation is totalitarian
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:23.760]  The left are totalitarian
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:26.760]  And the communists, the fascists were totalitarian
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:28.760]  This is the age-old battle
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:30.760]  But the Chinese philosophers meditated
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:32.760]  When I've said this before
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:34.760]  The Chinese philosophers always said
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:36.760]  The division was between the totalitarians
[02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:38.760]  On one side and the libertarians
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:40.760]  On the other, you and I Alex are libertarians
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:42.760]  The Muslim Islam and the world's left
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:45.760]  Are now united in a totalitarian desire
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:46.760]  To push the rest of us around
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:48.760]  And that's what this is about
[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:50.760]  If not just that Obama
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:52.760]  Talks of his Muslim faith
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:55.760]  It is that he is ideologically a totalitarian
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:55:58.760]  He recognizes that Islam in its present form
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:00.760]  Is also ideologically totalitarian
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:02.760]  Only one view, only one view
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:04.760]  So they're allied
[02:56:05.760 --> 02:56:06.760]  Lord Bonkton, we gotta go to break
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:08.760]  Do five more minutes with us
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:10.760]  Then we'll let you go and get back to that important
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:12.760]  Cocktail part of your having with the French
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:14.760]  That's all coming up
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:16.760]  In just about three minutes with Lord Bonkton
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:18.760]  We'll take a few more phone calls for Lord Bonkton
[02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:20.760]  We'll give him the floor in the last five minutes
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:22.760]  And then you're gonna have about 55 minutes
[02:56:23.760 --> 02:56:25.760]  Of David Knight, Joe Biggs on the road
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:27.760]  Out there at these caliphate
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:29.760]  Jihad centers around the U.S.
[02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:31.760]  Very dangerous mission

[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:35.760]  Will be reared

[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:43.760]  With the weekday program
[02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:45.760]  Briefly because I've hardly plugged today
[02:56:46.760 --> 02:56:47.760]  I've decided right through Christmas
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:49.760]  To be politically incorrect
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:51.760]  With that evil term Christmas

[02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:14.760]  They said hey we lose money not doing this
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:16.760]  Whatever people love it I'm doing it

[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:52.760]  Who cares if it doesn't work or not

[02:58:48.760 --> 02:58:49.760]  When cells become toxic
[02:58:50.760 --> 02:58:51.760]  They die early and aging sets in
[02:58:52.760 --> 02:58:53.760]  No one has put together a formula
[02:58:54.760 --> 02:58:55.760]  That focuses directly on brain health
[02:58:56.760 --> 02:58:57.760]  Nerve growth factors
[02:58:57.760 --> 02:58:59.760]  And optimizing your cellular energy
[02:59:00.760 --> 02:59:01.760]  At the same time
[02:59:02.760 --> 02:59:03.760]  Just one of the key compounds
[02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:05.760]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies
[02:59:06.760 --> 02:59:07.760]  You want the best that's out there

[02:59:18.760 --> 02:59:19.760]  Brain force is here
[02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:21.760]  Ladies and gentlemen
[02:59:22.760 --> 02:59:23.760]  I've been on this the last few months
[02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:25.760]  You probably noticed I've been more focused
[02:59:25.760 --> 02:59:26.760]  It's because of brain force
[02:59:27.760 --> 02:59:28.760]  There's always hidden additives in your food
[02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:30.760]  Even organic food has hidden additives
[02:59:31.760 --> 02:59:32.760]  I'm staring at the computer all day working doing good
[02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:34.760]  You're still damaging your brain
[02:59:35.760 --> 02:59:36.760]  Ultimately we've all been dumbed down to some degree
[02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:38.760]  It doesn't have stimulants
[02:59:39.760 --> 02:59:40.760]  It doesn't have garbage in it
[02:59:41.760 --> 02:59:42.760]  It has natural things that do it clean
[02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:44.760]  You will find brain force
[02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:46.760]  And other game changing products
[02:59:47.760 --> 02:59:48.760]  At infowarstore.com
[02:59:49.760 --> 02:59:50.760]  Or call 888-253-3139
[02:59:50.760 --> 02:59:53.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:02.760 --> 03:00:03.760]  Another world
[03:00:04.760 --> 03:00:05.760]  Another time
[03:00:06.760 --> 03:00:07.760]  Another world
[03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:09.760]  The age of rossocks
[03:00:10.760 --> 03:00:11.760]  Another time
[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:13.760]  In the age of wonder
[03:00:14.760 --> 03:00:15.760]  We had the people like Francis Bacon in charge now
[03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:17.760]  We'd be on Mars
[03:00:17.760 --> 03:00:18.760]  Life extension would already be in our hands
[03:00:22.760 --> 03:00:23.760]  Humans would already be at the next level
[03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:26.760]  If you are receiving this transmission
[03:00:27.760 --> 03:00:28.760]  You are the resistance
[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:30.760]  Live from Austin, Texas
[03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:32.760]  Broadcasting Worldwide
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:34.760]  It's Alex Jones
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:37.760]  But we'll run this blockade of Dark Ages
[03:00:38.760 --> 03:00:39.760]  Lord Monk, can I take a call or two in closing?
[03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:41.760]  But other key points you want to add
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:43.760]  What's coming up at this conference
[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:45.760]  It's not going to be a blockade
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:46.760]  The key points you want to add
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:48.760]  What's coming up at this conference
[03:00:49.760 --> 03:00:50.760]  You help get the secret documents
[03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:52.760]  Five years ago in Copenhagen
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:54.760]  Blow their plan for massive taxes on the third world
[03:00:55.760 --> 03:00:56.760]  Worldwide
[03:00:57.760 --> 03:00:58.760]  Will this conference be successful?
[03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:00.760]  What do we do as boffins
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:02.760]  To make sure this Death Star blows up
[03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:04.760]  Here's the thing
[03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:06.760]  This conference will declare success
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:08.760]  It will go into an extra day
[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:10.760]  This is part of the stage management
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:12.760]  That every single conference follows
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:14.760]  They're in an unannounced victory
[03:01:15.760 --> 03:01:16.760]  But actually it will be just like all the others
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:18.760]  They will always want more
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:20.760]  They want to keep this process going
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:22.760]  Because there are actually four conferences every year
[03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:24.760]  There's only one big one
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:26.760]  Where the heads of stake come
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:28.760]  But there are actually four conferences every year
[03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:30.760]  And a lot of in-between meetings
[03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:32.760]  They travel all over the globe at our expense
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:34.760]  And there's no way that this is going to stop
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:36.760]  While we continue to pay them to do this
[03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:38.760]  So I think what we've got to do
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:40.760]  Is to start prosecuting one or two of the fraudsters
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:41.760]  And lock them away for ten years for fraud
[03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:43.760]  And the rest will run for cover
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:45.760]  And the scare will collapse quite quickly
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:47.760]  And then these conferences will stop
[03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:50.760]  The UN meanwhile is beginning to use
[03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:52.760]  The IPCC structure
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:55.760]  As a way of setting up other global bodies
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:01:58.760]  On different areas of the environment
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:00.760]  To tie in with their Agenda 21
[03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:02.760]  Their Agenda 2030 program
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:04.760]  And that is also being peddled very hard
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:06.760]  At this conference
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:08.760]  And is largely being supported
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:09.760]  By governments who haven't realized
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:11.760]  That this is going to affect directly
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:13.760]  Not only their sovereignty over their nations
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:15.760]  They don't mind that too much
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:17.760]  Because they see themselves as part of the global government
[03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:19.760]  Rather than part of a national government
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:21.760]  But it's also going to start affecting their
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:23.760]  Individual property rights
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:25.760]  That's where this is headed
[03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:27.760]  Already in places like Australia
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:29.760]  Where Agenda 21 has been adopted
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:31.760]  By several left-wing councils
[03:02:32.760 --> 03:02:33.760]  Property rights have been virtually extinguished
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:35.760]  The same in New Zealand
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:36.760]  It's beginning to happen in the UK
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:38.760]  And in the United States
[03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:40.760]  Where left-wing councils are doing deals privately
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:42.760]  With the UN
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:44.760]  Round the back of their national governments
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:46.760]  This is another one
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:48.760]  That's going to have to be watched very carefully
[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:50.760]  Over the next few years
[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:52.760]  But no, I think from here on
[03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:54.760]  This is the dirty high tide mark
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:02:56.760]  In the bath
[03:02:57.760 --> 03:02:58.760]  Of the dirty water
[03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:00.760]  Of socialist climate change nonsense
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:02.760]  What is going to happen is
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:03.760]  I pulled the plug on this
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:05.760]  The bath is running out
[03:03:06.760 --> 03:03:07.760]  And the Paris conference will be recognized
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:09.760]  As the high tide mark
[03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:11.760]  This is as far as they've gone
[03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:13.760]  From here on in
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:15.760]  It's all going to collapse around them
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:17.760]  And by the way, Lord Moncton
[03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:19.760]  You've been on my show for 15 years
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:21.760]  You've been here for 15 years
[03:03:22.760 --> 03:03:23.760]  You have never been this positive
[03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:25.760]  So I know you're not just saying this
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:27.760]  You're the leading mind against these people
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:29.760]  And they're a eugenicist program
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:31.760]  That's the high mark. This is amazing
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:33.760]  From here on
[03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:35.760]  We, the lovers of freedom
[03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:37.760]  Are going to organize in the same way
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:39.760]  That they have organized
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:41.760]  We're beginning that at this conference here
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:43.760]  There is going to be a new international
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:45.760]  Party of freedom
[03:03:46.760 --> 03:03:47.760]  Which is going to stand up
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:49.760]  For all the ideals that you and I hold dear
[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:51.760]  Free market, libertarian thinking
[03:03:52.760 --> 03:03:53.760]  The vision of your founding fathers
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:03:55.760]  We want to globalize that vision
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:57.760]  And take on the totalitarian's head-on
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:03:59.760]  And say to them, enough is enough
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:01.760]  Freedom is the way forward for the world
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:03.760]  Without freedom, there can be no advance
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:05.760]  We merely slip back into the dark ages
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:07.760]  We've been there before
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:09.760]  We don't want to go there again
[03:04:10.760 --> 03:04:11.760]  And we are now going to win this
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:13.760]  Because of the strategic mistake they made
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:15.760]  In tying their totalitarian world
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:17.760]  Government ambitions to the nonsense
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:19.760]  That was global warming
[03:04:20.760 --> 03:04:21.760]  And I say was because there's now going to be
[03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:24.760]  Virtually none. Now they say it's change. Yeah, just any change.
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:27.760]  Now any change is just an excuse for them.
[03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:31.760]  Lord Moncton, Godspeed, silence and public policy.org
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:33.760]  Reporting from France will be tracking
[03:04:34.760 --> 03:04:35.760]  Everything you do, then FullWars.com
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:37.760]  We salute you for your stand
[03:04:38.760 --> 03:04:39.760]  For human liberty and renaissance.
[03:04:40.760 --> 03:04:41.760]  God bless you, Lord Moncton.
[03:04:42.760 --> 03:04:43.760]  God bless you, God bless America.
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:45.760]  Let's speak next week and wrap up for the conference.
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:47.760]  Absolutely, sir, you bet.
[03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:51.760]  All right, folks, coming up, Joe Biggs from the Caliphate Training Center.
[03:04:52.760 --> 03:04:53.760]  Stay with us.
[03:04:55.760 --> 03:04:56.760]  Republicans like Democrats are quick to jump in
[03:04:57.760 --> 03:04:58.760]  With supposed solutions after a tragedy.
[03:04:59.760 --> 03:05:00.760]  In the wake of the Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado,
[03:05:01.760 --> 03:05:02.760]  GOP leadership is pushing legislation
[03:05:03.760 --> 03:05:04.760]  By Congressman Tim Murphy.
[03:05:05.760 --> 03:05:06.760]  If passed, they should call it Murphy's Law
[03:05:07.760 --> 03:05:08.760]  Because, you know, what could possibly go wrong
[03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:10.760]  If you decide to, quote, fix the nation's mental health problems?
[03:05:10.760 --> 03:05:19.760]  Well, here's what would go wrong with Murphy's Law.
[03:05:20.760 --> 03:05:21.760]  It would lower privacy protection
[03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:23.760]  And give states financial incentives
[03:05:24.760 --> 03:05:27.760]  To allow judges to mandate psychiatric treatment.
[03:05:28.760 --> 03:05:29.760]  The Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to push a law
[03:05:30.760 --> 03:05:31.760]  That would ban gun purchases
[03:05:32.760 --> 03:05:33.760]  For those who have been put on the government's watch list
[03:05:34.760 --> 03:05:35.760]  Secretly, without knowing they're on
[03:05:36.760 --> 03:05:37.760]  Without opportunity to confront the charges
[03:05:37.760 --> 03:05:39.760]  And the witnesses publicly in court
[03:05:40.760 --> 03:05:41.760]  As guaranteed by the Constitution.
[03:05:42.760 --> 03:05:43.760]  So because of one man's act,
[03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:46.760]  Republicans offer us political abuse of psychiatry
[03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:50.760]  And Democrats offer us punishments from secret star chambers.

[03:05:53.760 --> 03:06:08.760]  I'm David Knight.
[03:06:23.760 --> 03:06:49.760]  I'm David Knight.
[03:06:49.760 --> 03:06:56.760]  I'm David Knight.
[03:07:19.760 --> 03:07:48.760]  I'm David Knight.
[03:07:49.760 --> 03:07:59.760]  I'm David Knight.
[03:08:20.760 --> 03:08:22.760]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:25.760]  I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour.
[03:08:26.760 --> 03:08:27.760]  We're going to be talking to Joe Biggs.
[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:29.760]  We're still trying to connect with him.
[03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:32.760]  He's on the road right now, filing reports about
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:35.760]  Different areas in the country that have seen
[03:08:36.760 --> 03:08:39.760]  Massive Islamic immigration.
[03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:41.760]  And as we're looking at this,
[03:08:42.760 --> 03:08:45.760]  I just saw this story today about out of France
[03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:47.760]  Where the police are telling Jewish people
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:48.760]  Not to celebrate Hanukkah in public.
[03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:50.760]  Don't light any candles anywhere
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:52.760]  Because we can't keep you safe.
[03:08:53.760 --> 03:08:54.760]  Now, that is nothing but an admission
[03:08:55.760 --> 03:08:57.760]  That they have lost control to the Islamic terrorists
[03:08:58.760 --> 03:08:59.760]  In their midst.
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:01.760]  They can't protect Jews.
[03:09:02.760 --> 03:09:03.760]  They can't protect Christians.
[03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:05.760]  Make sure you don't do any overt celebration
[03:09:06.760 --> 03:09:07.760]  About your religion because we have imported
[03:09:08.760 --> 03:09:09.760]  An intolerant minority in this country
[03:09:10.760 --> 03:09:11.760]  That will kill you out of their intolerance.
[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:13.760]  So not only intolerant,
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:16.760]  They will kill you out of that intolerance.
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:18.760]  But before we go to Joe,
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:20.760]  I want to let you know that today,
[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:23.760]  Sandy Berger, former National Security Advisor
[03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:25.760]  To Bill Clinton, died.
[03:09:26.760 --> 03:09:27.760]  Now, does that name sound familiar to you?
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:30.760]  My children probably won't remember the name.
[03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:32.760]  They remember him as Sandy Berger.
[03:09:33.760 --> 03:09:34.760]  That's the way I always referred to him
[03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:36.760]  In our household.
[03:09:37.760 --> 03:09:38.760]  He was the National Security Advisor
[03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:40.760]  Under Bill Clinton.
[03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:42.760]  And in 2004, as they were putting together
[03:09:43.760 --> 03:09:44.760]  The 9-11 Commission,
[03:09:45.760 --> 03:09:46.760]  He was Clinton's representative.
[03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:48.760]  And at that point,
[03:09:49.760 --> 03:09:50.760]  He did something incredibly strange.
[03:09:51.760 --> 03:09:52.760]  What he did was,
[03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:54.760]  He went to the National Archives.
[03:09:55.760 --> 03:09:56.760]  He started going multiple days
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:09:58.760]  To the National Archives.
[03:09:59.760 --> 03:10:01.760]  He would fold documents into his clothes.
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:03.760]  He would sneak them out of the archive building.
[03:10:04.760 --> 03:10:05.760]  He would stash them under construction trailer
[03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:07.760]  Nearby until he could return,
[03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:09.760]  Retreat them, and then later he would cut them up.
[03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:11.760]  He was eventually caught
[03:10:12.760 --> 03:10:14.760]  In his theft of secure documents.
[03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:16.760]  This is a guy who remember,
[03:10:17.760 --> 03:10:18.760]  He was National Security Advisor.
[03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:20.760]  He knows what the protocols are.
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:22.760]  He went to this area very deliberately
[03:10:23.760 --> 03:10:24.760]  Looking for documents
[03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:26.760]  That would be incriminating to the Clintons.
[03:10:27.760 --> 03:10:28.760]  Things showing their connection
[03:10:29.760 --> 03:10:30.760]  With Al Qaeda in America.
[03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:32.760]  Things that would be related to 9-11
[03:10:33.760 --> 03:10:34.760]  And previous attacks by Al Qaeda in America
[03:10:34.760 --> 03:10:36.760]  And the Clintons knew.
[03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:38.760]  Now, what happened to him?
[03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:40.760]  Well, he was eventually convicted
[03:10:41.760 --> 03:10:42.760]  Of a misdemeanor charge.
[03:10:43.760 --> 03:10:44.760]  And he had an unauthorized removal
[03:10:45.760 --> 03:10:46.760]  And retention of classified material.
[03:10:47.760 --> 03:10:48.760]  No prison time.
[03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:50.760]  No loss of his bar license.
[03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:52.760]  I'm reading this from Real Clear Politics.
[03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:54.760]  And as they point out,
[03:10:55.760 --> 03:10:56.760]  There was nothing about his actions
[03:10:57.760 --> 03:10:58.760]  That was accidental.
[03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:00.760]  There was nothing about his actions
[03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:02.760]  That was casual.
[03:11:02.760 --> 03:11:03.760]  That was normal.
[03:11:04.760 --> 03:11:05.760]  And so they ask, you know,
[03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:07.760]  When you've got somebody
[03:11:08.760 --> 03:11:09.760]  Who is a big time lawyer in Washington
[03:11:10.760 --> 03:11:11.760]  Very well connected.
[03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:13.760]  He's been the National Security Advisor
[03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:15.760]  For Bill Clinton.
[03:11:16.760 --> 03:11:17.760]  He's Bill Clinton's representative
[03:11:18.760 --> 03:11:19.760]  To the 9-11 Commission.
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:21.760]  He would risk his entire past,
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:23.760]  Present and future
[03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:25.760]  In order to destroy these documents.
[03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:27.760]  So what could have been important enough
[03:11:28.760 --> 03:11:29.760]  For somebody of his stature
[03:11:29.760 --> 03:11:31.760]  To disgrace, disbarment and prison?
[03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:34.760]  Ask yourself, what was he trying to cover up
[03:11:35.760 --> 03:11:36.760]  That the Clintons knew about 9-11?
[03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:38.760]  And then ask yourself this about Hillary Clinton.
[03:11:39.760 --> 03:11:40.760]  Why would she think
[03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:42.760]  That she could set up a private server?
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:44.760]  Why would she think she would need to do that?
[03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:46.760]  Why do you think she could get away
[03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:48.760]  She would think that she could get away with this
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:50.760]  As she so far has?
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:52.760]  Why would you think that Hillary Clinton
[03:11:53.760 --> 03:11:54.760]  Could lie about this
[03:11:55.760 --> 03:11:56.760]  And not face prosecution?
[03:11:56.760 --> 03:11:58.760]  That's how it's been done
[03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:00.760]  Through the Bill Clinton Administration
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:02.760]  Through people like Sandy Burglar
[03:12:03.760 --> 03:12:04.760]  Who as I pointed out today just died
[03:12:05.760 --> 03:12:06.760]  That's why we're bringing up his memory again
[03:12:07.760 --> 03:12:09.760]  But it really does tie into Hillary Clinton
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:11.760]  And understand this
[03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:13.760]  His response to this, well you know what
[03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:15.760]  I made a mistake
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:17.760]  Maybe he should just come out
[03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:19.760]  Like Hillary Clinton and said
[03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:21.760]  What difference does it make
[03:12:22.760 --> 03:12:23.760]  All the people already dead in the towers
[03:12:23.760 --> 03:12:25.760]  What happened there, we don't need to have an investigation
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:27.760]  What difference does it make
[03:12:28.760 --> 03:12:29.760]  It's done, it's finished
[03:12:30.760 --> 03:12:31.760]  He could have said that
[03:12:32.760 --> 03:12:33.760]  He said mistakes were made
[03:12:34.760 --> 03:12:35.760]  Mistakes were made
[03:12:36.760 --> 03:12:37.760]  Not that he did anything wrong
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:39.760]  Mistakes were made
[03:12:40.760 --> 03:12:41.760]  Okay, that's the issue
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:43.760]  They also said he only took out copies
[03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:45.760]  Now why would you do that
[03:12:46.760 --> 03:12:47.760]  Why would you only go in and take out copies
[03:12:48.760 --> 03:12:49.760]  They later found out
[03:12:50.760 --> 03:12:51.760]  That he had been given access
[03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:52.760]  He had been given access to
[03:12:53.760 --> 03:12:54.760]  Uninventoryed original documents
[03:12:55.760 --> 03:12:56.760]  You understand that
[03:12:57.760 --> 03:12:58.760]  He knew that he could get these documents out
[03:12:59.760 --> 03:13:00.760]  I'm sure he had the assistance of others as well
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:02.760]  He kept claiming that he was going to take
[03:13:03.760 --> 03:13:04.760]  Bathroom breaks and so forth and so on
[03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:06.760]  He was stuffing this stuff
[03:13:07.760 --> 03:13:08.760]  Down his pants
[03:13:09.760 --> 03:13:10.760]  And to his clothes
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:12.760]  Destroying the documents
[03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:14.760]  Destroying original uninventoryed
[03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:16.760]  National security documents
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:18.760]  That might have come to light
[03:13:18.760 --> 03:13:20.760]  During the 9-11 Commission
[03:13:21.760 --> 03:13:22.760]  Of course we have 28 pages
[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:24.760]  We're still not allowed to know
[03:13:25.760 --> 03:13:26.760]  What's going on with those pages
[03:13:27.760 --> 03:13:28.760]  Also today we had an interview
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:30.760]  On the nightly news
[03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:32.760]  When I did it on Monday night
[03:13:33.760 --> 03:13:34.760]  Interviewed a documentary
[03:13:35.760 --> 03:13:36.760]  Filmmaker J.D. King
[03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:38.760]  And the next day
[03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:40.760]  YouTube suspended his account
[03:13:41.760 --> 03:13:42.760]  Now it's interesting because he's a documentary
[03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:44.760]  Filmmaker who's already done two full-length
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:46.760]  Documentaries about climate change
[03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:47.760]  And how they were destroying Wolf
[03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:49.760]  It was about the reintroduction
[03:13:50.760 --> 03:13:51.760]  Of predatory wolves into Yellowstone
[03:13:52.760 --> 03:13:53.760]  He lives in the Montana area
[03:13:54.760 --> 03:13:55.760]  And how they were destroying
[03:13:56.760 --> 03:13:57.760]  The economy of Montana
[03:13:58.760 --> 03:13:59.760]  With the Agenda 21
[03:14:00.760 --> 03:14:01.760]  With a Bureau of Land Management
[03:14:02.760 --> 03:14:03.760]  With the Fish and Wildlife People
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:05.760]  With their regulations
[03:14:06.760 --> 03:14:07.760]  Essentially destroying the economy there
[03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:09.760]  Making people have to leave the area
[03:14:10.760 --> 03:14:11.760]  And he also had another documentary
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:13.760]  Called Blue
[03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:15.760]  About a documentary that was about
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:17.760]  Polar Bear populations
[03:14:18.760 --> 03:14:19.760]  And the fact that this icon
[03:14:20.760 --> 03:14:21.760]  This icon of global warming
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:23.760]  Is a total lie
[03:14:24.760 --> 03:14:25.760]  And so if you want to see that interview
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:27.760]  If you want to see the trailer for the film
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:29.760]  That he is trying to get money
[03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:31.760]  To raise for for this documentary right now
[03:14:32.760 --> 03:14:33.760]  If you want to see that
[03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:35.760]  You can still see it on our YouTube channel
[03:14:36.760 --> 03:14:37.760]  That video is called destroying the icon
[03:14:38.760 --> 03:14:39.760]  Of global warming
[03:14:40.760 --> 03:14:41.760]  Again, destroying the icon of global warming
[03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:42.760]  Nightly news from Monday night
[03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:44.760]  And see it in either of those places
[03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:46.760]  Our interview with JD King
[03:14:47.760 --> 03:14:48.760]  Who evidently his content
[03:14:49.760 --> 03:14:50.760]  Was too hot for YouTube
[03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:52.760]  Actually had been on YouTube for quite a while
[03:14:54.760 --> 03:14:55.760]  It was only after he had the interview with us
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:14:57.760]  That they took him down
[03:14:58.760 --> 03:14:59.760]  So I think they're very afraid of this
[03:15:00.760 --> 03:15:01.760]  Documentary that he would do
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:03.760]  Pointing out the polar bears among other things
[03:15:04.760 --> 03:15:05.760]  There were 5,000 polar bears
[03:15:06.760 --> 03:15:07.760]  When Al Gore was born
[03:15:08.760 --> 03:15:09.760]  He pointed out in his trailer
[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:10.760]  That there were 5,000 polar bears
[03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:12.760]  And as we pointed out, Noah says
[03:15:13.760 --> 03:15:14.760]  That the polar ice cap is growing
[03:15:15.760 --> 03:15:16.760]  And remember Al Gore told us
[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:18.760]  That it was going to have disappeared
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:20.760]  A couple of years ago
[03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:22.760]  David, I know you're about to go to Joe Biggs here
[03:15:23.760 --> 03:15:24.760]  And I meant to cover at the end of my show
[03:15:25.760 --> 03:15:26.760]  And I did, I dropped the ball
[03:15:27.760 --> 03:15:28.760]  San Bernardino 20 shot
[03:15:29.760 --> 03:15:30.760]  It's been going on for about 20 minutes or so
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:32.760]  About 5 minutes till I ended it came out
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:34.760]  So we'll be covering that also with Joe Biggs
[03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:36.760]  Coming up in you
[03:15:36.760 --> 03:15:38.760]  There are different shooters that might be jihadis
[03:15:39.760 --> 03:15:40.760]  They'll blame right wingers
[03:15:41.760 --> 03:15:42.760]  Even if it's a guy in a dress like Planned Parenthood
[03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:44.760]  But let's pray for those out there
[03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:46.760]  And hope there's a summation of the violence
[03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:48.760]  I know you're about to go to Joe Biggs
[03:15:49.760 --> 03:15:50.760]  I'll quit bugging you
[03:15:51.760 --> 03:15:52.760]  I want to let you know that's happening
[03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:54.760]  It's going to prompt a free news
[03:15:55.760 --> 03:15:56.760]  Great, yes, I hadn't seen that
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:15:58.760]  And we do have Joe Biggs on the line right now
[03:15:59.760 --> 03:16:00.760]  So let's go to Joe Biggs who is on the road
[03:16:01.760 --> 03:16:02.760]  Joe
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:04.760]  Roger that, I've been following this story
[03:16:04.760 --> 03:16:05.760]  It's just been going on for about 40 minutes
[03:16:06.760 --> 03:16:07.760]  And I thought it was kind of interesting
[03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:09.760]  They said the shooting locations around the corner
[03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:11.760]  From a Planned Parenthood
[03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:13.760]  Like they're trying to connect the fact
[03:16:14.760 --> 03:16:15.760]  That this is the exact same thing
[03:16:16.760 --> 03:16:17.760]  And there's also reports that one of the guys' names
[03:16:18.760 --> 03:16:19.760]  That they're looking for is a Muslim type name
[03:16:20.760 --> 03:16:21.760]  So I don't know the direction of this
[03:16:22.760 --> 03:16:23.760]  Story yet, it's just now happening
[03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:25.760]  It's only been going on for maybe 40 minutes or so
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:28.760]  So we'll be following that closely
[03:16:29.760 --> 03:16:30.760]  But right now we are in upstate New York
[03:16:31.760 --> 03:16:32.760]  We went to the Islamberg
[03:16:32.760 --> 03:16:33.760]  Right outside of Hancock in an area called Deposit
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:35.760]  And I went out there and was able to
[03:16:36.760 --> 03:16:37.760]  Go up to the compound
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:39.760]  And speak to some of the guys up there
[03:16:40.760 --> 03:16:41.760]  They have a gate guard
[03:16:42.760 --> 03:16:43.760]  And as soon as we approached
[03:16:44.760 --> 03:16:45.760]  The guy jumped out of his vehicle
[03:16:46.760 --> 03:16:47.760]  Came up to us and said we had to
[03:16:48.760 --> 03:16:49.760]  Request permission to go on
[03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:51.760]  Their compound
[03:16:52.760 --> 03:16:53.760]  And they passed my name up
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:55.760]  Through one of their media liaisons
[03:16:56.760 --> 03:16:57.760]  So I'm supposed to be getting a call back tonight
[03:16:58.760 --> 03:16:59.760]  Or something like that
[03:16:59.760 --> 03:17:00.760]  But as soon as I pulled up
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:02.760]  More vehicles came up
[03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:04.760]  People got out
[03:17:05.760 --> 03:17:06.760]  We're kind of curious as to why I was there
[03:17:07.760 --> 03:17:08.760]  You know, just a few days ago
[03:17:09.760 --> 03:17:10.760]  The guy, his name's John Reitzheimer
[03:17:11.760 --> 03:17:12.760]  He was the guy who orchestrated
[03:17:13.760 --> 03:17:14.760]  The Draw the Profit rally
[03:17:15.760 --> 03:17:16.760]  In Phoenix, Arizona
[03:17:17.760 --> 03:17:18.760]  That I covered a few months back
[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:20.760]  He apparently made a video on YouTube
[03:17:21.760 --> 03:17:22.760]  Threatening to go to Islamberg
[03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:24.760]  And upstate New York
[03:17:25.760 --> 03:17:26.760]  And shoot those guys
[03:17:26.760 --> 03:17:28.760]  Because they called him an American Taliban
[03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:30.760]  So the people there on high alert
[03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:32.760]  We actually spoke to the sheriff of deposit
[03:17:33.760 --> 03:17:34.760]  Which is at the bottom of the valley
[03:17:35.760 --> 03:17:36.760]  Down there, right where that compound is
[03:17:37.760 --> 03:17:38.760]  And it's a very eerie area
[03:17:39.760 --> 03:17:42.760]  Very mountainous, low-faw, cloudy, rainy, cool outside
[03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:44.760]  That compound's up on a hill
[03:17:45.760 --> 03:17:46.760]  And it's a really large area
[03:17:47.760 --> 03:17:48.760]  Looks like some normal houses in that area
[03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:50.760]  But they're very secretive
[03:17:51.760 --> 03:17:52.760]  You know, we talked to the sheriff
[03:17:53.760 --> 03:17:54.760]  He described them as militant
[03:17:54.760 --> 03:17:55.760]  We actually have footage from inside
[03:17:56.760 --> 03:17:57.760]  The sheriff's department
[03:17:58.760 --> 03:17:59.760]  We're going to put that video out later
[03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:01.760]  When we have the opportunity to do so
[03:18:02.760 --> 03:18:03.760]  Due to the internet not being so good here
[03:18:04.760 --> 03:18:05.760]  Alright, tell us what Islamberg is
[03:18:06.760 --> 03:18:09.760]  Now Islamberg was founded in
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:11.760]  Let me see, I have the paperwork right here
[03:18:12.760 --> 03:18:13.760]  In 1982
[03:18:14.760 --> 03:18:15.760]  By a group called Muslims of America
[03:18:16.760 --> 03:18:17.760]  Now Muslims of America was founded by
[03:18:18.760 --> 03:18:19.760]  Mumbark Ali Jalani
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:22.760]  And he is part of the terrorist group
[03:18:22.760 --> 03:18:23.760]  Known as Al Fukhra
[03:18:24.760 --> 03:18:25.760]  Now Al Fukhra is not considered
[03:18:26.760 --> 03:18:27.760]  A terrorist organization by the White House
[03:18:28.760 --> 03:18:29.760]  But the state department has deemed them
[03:18:30.760 --> 03:18:31.760]  A terror group
[03:18:32.760 --> 03:18:33.760]  So I think that's kind of odd
[03:18:34.760 --> 03:18:35.760]  That you've got one saying it is
[03:18:36.760 --> 03:18:37.760]  One saying it isn't
[03:18:38.760 --> 03:18:40.760]  Now he is basically a Pakistani cleric
[03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:42.760]  Who testifies to the holiness of a shrine
[03:18:43.760 --> 03:18:44.760]  Where miracles allegedly prove his supernatural powers
[03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:46.760]  And he also thinks that terror is part of
[03:18:47.760 --> 03:18:48.760]  The terrorist organization known as Al Fukhra
[03:18:49.760 --> 03:18:50.760]  Now Al Fukhra is not considered
[03:18:50.760 --> 03:18:51.760]  A terrorist organization by the White House
[03:18:52.760 --> 03:18:53.760]  And he also thinks that terrorism is caused by
[03:18:54.760 --> 03:18:55.760]  Genies
[03:18:56.760 --> 03:18:57.760]  So this is definitely
[03:18:58.760 --> 03:18:59.760]  Terrorism is called by what?
[03:19:00.760 --> 03:19:01.760]  Genies
[03:19:02.760 --> 03:19:03.760]  Yes
[03:19:04.760 --> 03:19:05.760]  It's not because of radical Islam
[03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:07.760]  Or anything like that at all
[03:19:08.760 --> 03:19:09.760]  It's because of genies and the gypsies
[03:19:10.760 --> 03:19:11.760]  Don't rub any lamps, folks
[03:19:12.760 --> 03:19:13.760]  Because we don't want any more terrorism
[03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:15.760]  Now I have some paperwork right here
[03:19:16.760 --> 03:19:17.760]  It says Al Fukhra was behind many assassinations
[03:19:17.760 --> 03:19:19.760]  And bombings between 1979 and the early 1990s
[03:19:20.760 --> 03:19:21.760]  His biggest plot aimed to kill 4,500 Indians
[03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:24.760]  In Toronto during the light
[03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:26.760]  Or the festival of light
[03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:28.760]  So they've been connected to a lot of things
[03:19:29.760 --> 03:19:30.760]  And yet this compound
[03:19:31.760 --> 03:19:32.760]  Is allowed to be running
[03:19:33.760 --> 03:19:34.760]  And open
[03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:36.760]  And yet nothing is done by it
[03:19:37.760 --> 03:19:38.760]  You know, you ask, we talk to the people, the locals there
[03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:40.760]  It's very mysterious
[03:19:41.760 --> 03:19:42.760]  A lot of people aren't allowed to go in there
[03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:44.760]  They handle everything internally
[03:19:44.760 --> 03:19:46.760]  Even Sharia law and the sheriff even said
[03:19:47.760 --> 03:19:48.760]  That's what they use to govern their compound
[03:19:49.760 --> 03:19:50.760]  Hang on, Joe, we're going to come right back to Joe Biggs
[03:19:51.760 --> 03:19:52.760]  He's at Islamberg
[03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:54.760]  We'll tell you more about that when we come back
[03:19:55.760 --> 03:19:56.760]  We'll be right back
[03:19:57.760 --> 03:19:58.760]  That's so great
[03:20:01.760 --> 03:20:02.760]  Earthquake, floods
[03:20:03.760 --> 03:20:04.760]  Winter storms, prolonged power outages
[03:20:05.760 --> 03:20:06.760]  Or war
[03:20:07.760 --> 03:20:08.760]  Each of us have had that moment
[03:20:09.760 --> 03:20:10.760]  When we recognize that we need to be better prepared
[03:20:11.760 --> 03:20:12.760]  We typically do the same thing
[03:20:12.760 --> 03:20:13.760]  With food storage
[03:20:14.760 --> 03:20:15.760]  Then we address the need for water
[03:20:16.760 --> 03:20:17.760]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:20:18.760 --> 03:20:19.760]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold
[03:20:20.760 --> 03:20:21.760]  Here are some things for you to consider
[03:20:22.760 --> 03:20:23.760]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:20:24.760 --> 03:20:25.760]  The standard answers are firewood, coal or propane
[03:20:26.760 --> 03:20:27.760]  But the problem with that
[03:20:28.760 --> 03:20:29.760]  If you need to be on the move is
[03:20:30.760 --> 03:20:31.760]  You can't take it with you
[03:20:32.760 --> 03:20:33.760]  Another concern
[03:20:34.760 --> 03:20:35.760]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke
[03:20:36.760 --> 03:20:37.760]  Like in times of war
[03:20:38.760 --> 03:20:39.760]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel
[03:20:39.760 --> 03:20:41.760]  It may be simpler and less costly than you think
[03:20:42.760 --> 03:20:44.760]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com
[03:20:45.760 --> 03:20:46.760]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers
[03:20:47.760 --> 03:20:48.760]  To your heat storage dilemma
[03:20:49.760 --> 03:20:50.760]  Don't get stuck in the cold
[03:20:51.760 --> 03:20:52.760]  FortressClothing.com
[03:20:53.760 --> 03:20:54.760]  You'll never be cold again
[03:20:58.760 --> 03:20:59.760]  My fellow patriots
[03:21:00.760 --> 03:21:01.760]  One of the things I'm most proud of
[03:21:02.760 --> 03:21:03.760]  Is the fact that the M4 Wars operation
[03:21:04.760 --> 03:21:05.760]  Reaches more than 20 million people a week
[03:21:06.760 --> 03:21:07.760]  Worldwide with a message of liberty
[03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:09.760]  And none of it is funded by major global corporations
[03:21:10.760 --> 03:21:11.760]  Or by taxpayers
[03:21:12.760 --> 03:21:13.760]  It's funded by free will
[03:21:14.760 --> 03:21:15.760]  Listeners and viewers like you

[03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:38.760]  That remove glyphosates, fluoride more
[03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:40.760]  And the list of specials goes on and on
[03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:42.760]  Some discounts are as high as 50%

[03:21:51.760 --> 03:21:52.760]  And remember
[03:21:53.760 --> 03:21:54.760]  M4Wars is the operation that you built
[03:21:55.760 --> 03:21:56.760]  The following is an important holiday
[03:21:57.760 --> 03:21:58.760]  Inventory announcement
[03:21:59.760 --> 03:22:00.760]  From idstronghold.com
[03:22:01.760 --> 03:22:02.760]  As many of you have come to know
[03:22:02.760 --> 03:22:03.760]  Idstronghold.com is the number one name
[03:22:04.760 --> 03:22:05.760]  In quality RFID blocking wallets
[03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:07.760]  And actually do as they say
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:09.760]  And prevent electronic pickpocketing
[03:22:10.760 --> 03:22:11.760]  Of the new RFID chips
[03:22:12.760 --> 03:22:13.760]  Founding credit cards, room keys
[03:22:14.760 --> 03:22:15.760]  Subway passes and more
[03:22:16.760 --> 03:22:17.760]  Last year, due to the extreme popularity
[03:22:18.760 --> 03:22:19.760]  Of giving Idstronghold wallets and clutches
[03:22:20.760 --> 03:22:21.760]  As unique gifts at Christmas time
[03:22:22.760 --> 03:22:23.760]  We ran out of our most popular styles
[03:22:24.760 --> 03:22:25.760]  And colors early
[03:22:26.760 --> 03:22:27.760]  The good news is

[03:22:50.760 --> 03:22:51.760]  These wallets aren't available in stores
[03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:53.760]  So visit idstronghold.com today

[03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:28.760]  And wellness
[03:23:29.760 --> 03:23:30.760]  A gift that can change lives
[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:32.760]  And make a real difference
[03:23:33.760 --> 03:23:34.760]  In a world where we are constantly exposed
[03:23:35.760 --> 03:23:36.760]  To dangerous health threats
[03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:38.760]  Give yourself and your loved ones
[03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:40.760]  A fighting chance
[03:23:41.760 --> 03:23:42.760]  Give Supernatural Silver

[03:23:55.760 --> 03:23:56.760]  From all of us here at www.supernaturalsilver.com
[03:23:58.760 --> 03:23:59.760]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show
[03:24:00.760 --> 03:24:01.760]  I'm David Knight
[03:24:02.760 --> 03:24:03.760]  And we're talking to a reporter Joe Vicks
[03:24:04.760 --> 03:24:05.760]  Who is on the ground in Islamburg
[03:24:06.760 --> 03:24:07.760]  We're going to tell you more about that in just a moment
[03:24:08.760 --> 03:24:09.760]  Before I go back to Joe
[03:24:10.760 --> 03:24:11.760]  Well, as you know, I'm David Knight
[03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:13.760]  And we're talking to a reporter Joe Vicks
[03:24:14.760 --> 03:24:15.760]  Who is on the ground in Islamburg
[03:24:16.760 --> 03:24:17.760]  We're going to tell you more about that
[03:24:17.760 --> 03:24:19.760]  In just a moment before I go back to Joe
[03:24:20.760 --> 03:24:21.760]  Well, as you know about these specials
[03:24:22.760 --> 03:24:23.760]  That we are continuing and as they are expiring
[03:24:24.760 --> 03:24:25.760]  Remember last week we put on specials
[03:24:26.760 --> 03:24:27.760]  One day a week
[03:24:28.760 --> 03:24:29.760]  This week these specials are coming off each day
[03:24:30.760 --> 03:24:31.760]  The one that is expiring today
[03:24:32.760 --> 03:24:33.760]  Is 33% off DNA force
[03:24:34.760 --> 03:24:36.760]  And 30% off secret 12 vitamin B12
[03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:38.760]  And of course that's going to end tonight
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:40.760]  At midnight
[03:24:41.760 --> 03:24:42.760]  We also have unprecedented sales
[03:24:43.760 --> 03:24:44.760]  On some other items
[03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:46.760]  For silver bullet, 30% off X2 nascent iodine
[03:24:47.760 --> 03:24:48.760]  30% off brain force
[03:24:49.760 --> 03:24:50.760]  20% off Infowars
[03:24:51.760 --> 03:24:52.760]  Select storable food
[03:24:53.760 --> 03:24:54.760]  All those will still be on after tonight
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:24:56.760]  But these are falling off each day
[03:24:57.760 --> 03:24:58.760]  One of these items will drop off
[03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:00.760]  Just as we had one drop off yesterday
[03:25:01.760 --> 03:25:02.760]  And again, remember you can get
[03:25:03.760 --> 03:25:04.760]  Free shipping between now
[03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:06.760]  And I think it is December 18
[03:25:07.760 --> 03:25:08.760]  I think it's just before
[03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:10.760]  We can not guarantee
[03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:12.760]  That you're going to get it by Christmas time
[03:25:12.760 --> 03:25:13.760]  So again, we've got one special
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:15.760]  That's ending today
[03:25:16.760 --> 03:25:17.760]  33% off DNA force
[03:25:18.760 --> 03:25:19.760]  30% off secret 12 vitamin B12
[03:25:20.760 --> 03:25:21.760]  Check that out at infowarslife.com
[03:25:22.760 --> 03:25:23.760]  Also the specials at infowarsstore.com
[03:25:24.760 --> 03:25:25.760]  Going back to Joe Biggs
[03:25:26.760 --> 03:25:27.760]  Joe, there was a report
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:29.760]  And I mentioned it earlier in the broadcast
[03:25:30.760 --> 03:25:31.760]  About Paris police telling Jews
[03:25:32.760 --> 03:25:33.760]  Not to light Hanukkah candles
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:35.760]  And public spaces
[03:25:36.760 --> 03:25:37.760]  There was a tweet that was sent out
[03:25:38.760 --> 03:25:39.760]  Said Paris police order us to cancel
[03:25:39.760 --> 03:25:41.760]  Candle lighting in the city and light a pair of attacks
[03:25:42.760 --> 03:25:43.760]  And fear of additional attacks
[03:25:44.760 --> 03:25:45.760]  Efforts are underway to approve a candle lighting
[03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:47.760]  At the foot of the Eiffel Tower
[03:25:48.760 --> 03:25:49.760]  Joe, that's an admission
[03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:51.760]  That they've lost control in Paris, isn't it?
[03:25:52.760 --> 03:25:53.760]  Yeah, exactly
[03:25:54.760 --> 03:25:55.760]  The moment you stop doing the normal things
[03:25:56.760 --> 03:25:57.760]  That you would normally do
[03:25:58.760 --> 03:25:59.760]  Practicing your religion day to day activities
[03:26:00.760 --> 03:26:01.760]  That's when the terrorists win
[03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:03.760]  That's what they want
[03:26:04.760 --> 03:26:05.760]  They want to disrupt your day to day life
[03:26:06.760 --> 03:26:07.760]  And the fact that the French government
[03:26:07.760 --> 03:26:08.760]  Is not allowed to go out and do this
[03:26:09.760 --> 03:26:10.760]  The fact that they extended this whole
[03:26:11.760 --> 03:26:12.760]  Martial law state for three months
[03:26:13.760 --> 03:26:14.760]  Not allowing people to congregate
[03:26:15.760 --> 03:26:16.760]  Not allowing people to be outside
[03:26:17.760 --> 03:26:18.760]  Like that in large numbers
[03:26:19.760 --> 03:26:20.760]  Giving the police the ability to go door to door
[03:26:21.760 --> 03:26:22.760]  Without a warrant
[03:26:23.760 --> 03:26:24.760]  Today in France, they just closed down
[03:26:25.760 --> 03:26:26.760]  Three mosques
[03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:28.760]  So there's a lot of stuff going on
[03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:30.760]  And people think it's happening over there
[03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:32.760]  But it's got a very good chance
[03:26:33.760 --> 03:26:34.760]  Of happening here in the states
[03:26:34.760 --> 03:26:35.760]  And that's what we see is bringing in people
[03:26:36.760 --> 03:26:37.760]  By the millions into western civilization
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:39.760]  In the name of tolerance
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:41.760]  And we must not say anything bad
[03:26:42.760 --> 03:26:43.760]  About bringing these people in
[03:26:44.760 --> 03:26:45.760]  And yet they're going to establish
[03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:47.760]  The most intolerant society we have
[03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:49.760]  Never seen before
[03:26:50.760 --> 03:26:51.760]  And that's what we see
[03:26:52.760 --> 03:26:53.760]  In the name of tolerance
[03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:55.760]  And we must not say anything bad
[03:26:56.760 --> 03:26:57.760]  About bringing these people in
[03:26:58.760 --> 03:26:59.760]  And yet they're going to establish
[03:27:00.760 --> 03:27:01.760]  The most intolerant society we have
[03:27:01.760 --> 03:27:02.760]  Never seen anything like this
[03:27:03.760 --> 03:27:04.760]  Anywhere in our lifetime
[03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:06.760]  Or many of our ancestors
[03:27:07.760 --> 03:27:08.760]  For multiple generations
[03:27:09.760 --> 03:27:10.760]  We've never seen this kind of intolerance
[03:27:11.760 --> 03:27:12.760]  In the west
[03:27:13.760 --> 03:27:14.760]  And it's an intolerance
[03:27:15.760 --> 03:27:16.760]  That not only extends to penalties
[03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:18.760]  And anger and harsh words
[03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:20.760]  They will kill you out of their intolerance
[03:27:21.760 --> 03:27:22.760]  As well
[03:27:23.760 --> 03:27:24.760]  Well, exactly
[03:27:25.760 --> 03:27:26.760]  Just like reporter Daniel Pearl
[03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:28.760]  Daniel Pearl was actually investigating
[03:27:28.760 --> 03:27:30.760]  That Moonbark Ali Jolani, part of Al-Fukhra
[03:27:31.760 --> 03:27:32.760]  Help start and fund here in America
[03:27:33.760 --> 03:27:34.760]  Daniel Pearl actually went to Pakistan
[03:27:35.760 --> 03:27:36.760]  And he goes speak with his cleric
[03:27:37.760 --> 03:27:38.760]  And was abducted
[03:27:39.760 --> 03:27:40.760]  And then essentially murdered
[03:27:41.760 --> 03:27:42.760]  And they believe that Jolani had
[03:27:43.760 --> 03:27:44.760]  A lot to do with that
[03:27:45.760 --> 03:27:46.760]  Now I was going to show you guys this
[03:27:47.760 --> 03:27:48.760]  Inside the compound
[03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:50.760]  They make their own papers called
[03:27:51.760 --> 03:27:52.760]  The Islamic Post
[03:27:53.760 --> 03:27:54.760]  And we found a very interesting article in here
[03:27:55.760 --> 03:27:56.760]  Because it's titled
[03:27:56.760 --> 03:27:57.760]  The Islamic Post
[03:27:58.760 --> 03:27:59.760]  And the Islamberg
[03:28:00.760 --> 03:28:01.760]  That is a private compound
[03:28:02.760 --> 03:28:03.760]  It's not an incorporated city
[03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:05.760]  Or anything like that, right?
[03:28:06.760 --> 03:28:07.760]  Yes, it's a private compound
[03:28:08.760 --> 03:28:09.760]  Now it says right here
[03:28:10.760 --> 03:28:11.760]  Fear Sharia is coming to America
[03:28:12.760 --> 03:28:13.760]  Question mark too late
[03:28:14.760 --> 03:28:15.760]  It's already here
[03:28:16.760 --> 03:28:17.760]  Now when I spoke with the sheriff
[03:28:18.760 --> 03:28:19.760]  Of the deposit
[03:28:20.760 --> 03:28:21.760]  Here in New York
[03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:23.760]  The guy said that
[03:28:23.760 --> 03:28:25.760]  All the police, they will ask the police to come on
[03:28:26.760 --> 03:28:27.760]  And help them
[03:28:28.760 --> 03:28:29.760]  But that doesn't happen
[03:28:30.760 --> 03:28:31.760]  They're very secretive
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:33.760]  And he said whatever happens
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:35.760]  Whatever kind of violence, killing, murder
[03:28:36.760 --> 03:28:37.760]  Whatever it may be
[03:28:38.760 --> 03:28:39.760]  But happens there, they deal with it internally
[03:28:40.760 --> 03:28:41.760]  So my next question to the sheriff was
[03:28:42.760 --> 03:28:43.760]  Is that basically Sharia law running
[03:28:44.760 --> 03:28:45.760]  Their compound
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:47.760]  And he said yes it is
[03:28:48.760 --> 03:28:49.760]  And he talked about how they wear military clothing
[03:28:50.760 --> 03:28:51.760]  Garbs
[03:28:51.760 --> 03:28:52.760]  And it's a group of people
[03:28:53.760 --> 03:28:54.760]  The fact that it is so secretive
[03:28:55.760 --> 03:28:56.760]  And that we can't get in there
[03:28:57.760 --> 03:28:58.760]  And find out what's going on
[03:28:59.760 --> 03:29:00.760]  The fact that Sharia law
[03:29:01.760 --> 03:29:02.760]  As we've seen in the community in Michigan
[03:29:03.760 --> 03:29:04.760]  Where they say within 500 feet of a mosque
[03:29:05.760 --> 03:29:06.760]  You can't have any alcohol
[03:29:07.760 --> 03:29:08.760]  And so that's changing everything about that small town
[03:29:09.760 --> 03:29:10.760]  That is Sharia law
[03:29:11.760 --> 03:29:12.760]  De facto
[03:29:13.760 --> 03:29:14.760]  It's not de jure, they didn't declare it
[03:29:15.760 --> 03:29:16.760]  They didn't say we're erecting Sharia law
[03:29:17.760 --> 03:29:18.760]  Now instead what they do is they implement
[03:29:18.760 --> 03:29:20.760]  The effects of it whenever they get a majority in any area
[03:29:21.760 --> 03:29:22.760]  We see the intolerance come out at that point
[03:29:23.760 --> 03:29:24.760]  Yeah they were trying to compare it in the article
[03:29:25.760 --> 03:29:26.760]  The Sharia law to our U.S. Constitution
[03:29:27.760 --> 03:29:29.760]  I mean there's definitely some interesting stuff in this paper
[03:29:30.760 --> 03:29:31.760]  Alright we're going to have more reports from Joe Biggs
[03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:33.760]  As they continue to travel
[03:29:34.760 --> 03:29:35.760]  Thank you Joe
[03:29:36.760 --> 03:29:37.760]  In the next segment we're going to have a replay
[03:29:38.760 --> 03:29:39.760]  Of the interview that Alex Jones had earlier today
[03:29:40.760 --> 03:29:41.760]  With Donald Trump
[03:29:41.760 --> 03:29:47.760]  Music
[03:29:48.760 --> 03:29:49.760]  We're on the march
[03:29:50.760 --> 03:29:51.760]  The empires on the run
[03:29:52.760 --> 03:29:54.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[03:29:58.760 --> 03:29:59.760]  Three years ago
[03:30:00.760 --> 03:30:01.760]  Half of the 16 billion dollars
[03:30:02.760 --> 03:30:04.760]  Dolled out to the Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program
[03:30:05.760 --> 03:30:06.760]  Was invested in companies that had gone bankrupt
[03:30:07.760 --> 03:30:08.760]  Or laying off workers
[03:30:08.760 --> 03:30:10.760]  Overheaded for bankruptcy
[03:30:11.760 --> 03:30:12.760]  But the Department of Energy didn't learn
[03:30:13.760 --> 03:30:14.760]  From its mal-investments
[03:30:15.760 --> 03:30:16.760]  It then invested 3 billion dollars
[03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:18.760]  In a Spanish company, Ebingoa
[03:30:19.760 --> 03:30:20.760]  Now, three years later
[03:30:21.760 --> 03:30:22.760]  One day before the Paris Climate Summit
[03:30:23.760 --> 03:30:24.760]  Ebingoa declared bankruptcy
[03:30:25.760 --> 03:30:26.760]  The 3 billion dollars of taxpayer money
[03:30:27.760 --> 03:30:28.760]  That will likely be lost and whole
[03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:30.760]  Or in part is six times bigger than Selengra
[03:30:31.760 --> 03:30:32.760]  Green renewable mandates
[03:30:33.760 --> 03:30:34.760]  Have brought energy poverty to the people of Spain
[03:30:35.760 --> 03:30:36.760]  Where electricity is crippled
[03:30:36.760 --> 03:30:37.760]  In the U.S.
[03:30:38.760 --> 03:30:39.760]  And electricity will become a luxury in the U.S.
[03:30:40.760 --> 03:30:41.760]  As well, as Obama is allowed
[03:30:42.760 --> 03:30:43.760]  To continue his crony climatism
[03:30:44.760 --> 03:30:45.760]  The Paris Summit
[03:30:46.760 --> 03:30:47.760]  Seeks to accelerate the economic decline
[03:30:48.760 --> 03:30:49.760]  Of the West transferring wealth
[03:30:50.760 --> 03:30:51.760]  To developing nations in the form of green infrastructure
[03:30:52.760 --> 03:30:53.760]  But it's just greenwashing
[03:30:54.760 --> 03:30:55.760]  For crony climatism and global governance
[03:30:56.760 --> 03:30:57.760]  For Infowars.com

[03:32:04.760 --> 03:32:05.760]  That spurred me to do the research
[03:32:06.760 --> 03:32:07.760]  To develop a true nutraceutical formula
[03:32:08.760 --> 03:32:09.760]  That was designed to smooth out
[03:32:10.760 --> 03:32:11.760]  And help children focus
[03:32:12.760 --> 03:32:13.760]  All of our children are hit
[03:32:14.760 --> 03:32:15.760]  With modern mind control
[03:32:16.760 --> 03:32:17.760]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars

[03:32:20.760 --> 03:32:21.760]  Young humans have not yet developed
[03:32:22.760 --> 03:32:23.760]  Their nervous system
[03:32:24.760 --> 03:32:25.760]  And are being hammered daily
[03:32:25.760 --> 03:32:26.760]  To focus and calm down
[03:32:27.760 --> 03:32:28.760]  And then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs

[03:32:37.760 --> 03:32:38.760]  We worked with the leading manufacturer
[03:32:39.760 --> 03:32:40.760]  And nutritional supplements

[03:33:20.760 --> 03:33:21.760]  It's Alex Jones
[03:33:24.760 --> 03:33:25.760]  Well, we had Matt Drudge
[03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:27.760]  About a month ago in studio
[03:33:28.760 --> 03:33:29.760]  Only does an interview every three, four years
[03:33:30.760 --> 03:33:31.760]  And I thought that got me excited
[03:33:32.760 --> 03:33:33.760]  But I'm telling you
[03:33:34.760 --> 03:33:35.760]  Donald Trump is our guest
[03:33:36.760 --> 03:33:37.760]  Ladies and gentlemen
[03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:39.760]  For the next 30 minutes or so
[03:33:40.760 --> 03:33:41.760]  And obviously he is a maverick
[03:33:42.760 --> 03:33:43.760]  He's an original
[03:33:44.760 --> 03:33:45.760]  He tells it like it is
[03:33:46.760 --> 03:33:47.760]  Doesn't read off a teleprompter
[03:33:48.760 --> 03:33:49.760]  Neither do I
[03:33:49.760 --> 03:33:50.760]  And he's the only person
[03:33:51.760 --> 03:33:52.760]  That reaches 20 million people a week
[03:33:53.760 --> 03:33:54.760]  Worldwide, conservatively, self-made
[03:33:55.760 --> 03:33:56.760]  That's why I'm so excited
[03:33:57.760 --> 03:33:58.760]  And he joins us from
[03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:00.760]  Trump Tower in New York City
[03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:02.760]  He is the leading 2016
[03:34:03.760 --> 03:34:04.760]  Republican presidential contender
[03:34:05.760 --> 03:34:06.760]  Donald Trump again joins us
[03:34:07.760 --> 03:34:08.760]  And I've got so many questions
[03:34:09.760 --> 03:34:10.760]  But first off, Donald
[03:34:11.760 --> 03:34:12.760]  Thank you for joining us
[03:34:13.760 --> 03:34:14.760]  Thank you, Alex
[03:34:15.760 --> 03:34:16.760]  Great to be with you
[03:34:16.760 --> 03:34:18.760]  It's time, the last six months
[03:34:19.760 --> 03:34:20.760]  On the radical Muslim celebrating
[03:34:21.760 --> 03:34:22.760]  Not just in New Jersey
[03:34:23.760 --> 03:34:24.760]  But New York, Palestine all over
[03:34:25.760 --> 03:34:26.760]  What do you have to say?
[03:34:27.760 --> 03:34:28.760]  They're still attacking you
[03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:30.760]  Though we've got Dan Rather on video
[03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:32.760]  We've got New York Post
[03:34:33.760 --> 03:34:34.760]  We've got Washington Post
[03:34:35.760 --> 03:34:36.760]  I mean, what's going on here?
[03:34:37.760 --> 03:34:38.760]  Well, I took a lot of heat
[03:34:39.760 --> 03:34:40.760]  And I was very strong on it
[03:34:41.760 --> 03:34:42.760]  And I held my line
[03:34:43.760 --> 03:34:44.760]  And then all of a sudden
[03:34:44.760 --> 03:34:45.760]  12,000 people, which is fantastic
[03:34:46.760 --> 03:34:47.760]  And the people were saying
[03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:49.760]  Many of the people from New Jersey
[03:34:50.760 --> 03:34:51.760]  Four or five people said
[03:34:52.760 --> 03:34:53.760]  Mr. Trump, I saw it myself
[03:34:54.760 --> 03:34:55.760]  I was there, they talked about Patterson
[03:34:56.760 --> 03:34:57.760]  But they said I saw it myself
[03:34:58.760 --> 03:34:59.760]  Mr. Trump, I was there
[03:35:00.760 --> 03:35:01.760]  So many people have called in
[03:35:02.760 --> 03:35:03.760]  And on Twitter, at real Donald Trump
[03:35:04.760 --> 03:35:05.760]  They're all tweeting
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:07.760]  So I knew it happened
[03:35:08.760 --> 03:35:09.760]  And I held my line
[03:35:10.760 --> 03:35:11.760]  And people wanted me to apologize
[03:35:11.760 --> 03:35:13.760]  We can do it if we're wrong, Alex
[03:35:14.760 --> 03:35:15.760]  You apologize, I'd apologize if I was wrong
[03:35:16.760 --> 03:35:17.760]  But they were celebrating
[03:35:18.760 --> 03:35:19.760]  And they were celebrating the fall
[03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:21.760]  Of the World Trade Center
[03:35:22.760 --> 03:35:23.760]  I think that's disgraceful
[03:35:24.760 --> 03:35:25.760]  It is, and that same week
[03:35:26.760 --> 03:35:27.760]  You were reporting on that fact
[03:35:28.760 --> 03:35:29.760]  We had two different international football games
[03:35:30.760 --> 03:35:31.760]  Soccer games with the Turkish fans
[03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:33.760]  And others during the moment of silence
[03:35:34.760 --> 03:35:35.760]  For the dead people in Paris
[03:35:36.760 --> 03:35:37.760]  Chaining Allah Akbar and booing
[03:35:38.760 --> 03:35:39.760]  So did that not happen too?
[03:35:39.760 --> 03:35:40.760]  It happened and everybody saw it
[03:35:41.760 --> 03:35:42.760]  That was a week ago
[03:35:43.760 --> 03:35:44.760]  And the players were out on the field
[03:35:45.760 --> 03:35:46.760]  And they couldn't believe it
[03:35:47.760 --> 03:35:48.760]  They were embarrassed, they didn't know what to do
[03:35:49.760 --> 03:35:50.760]  The coach and the managers, they all apologized
[03:35:51.760 --> 03:35:52.760]  But it happened, look, we have to deal with reality
[03:35:53.760 --> 03:35:54.760]  And you know, it all started
[03:35:55.760 --> 03:35:56.760]  Because they said we need surveillance
[03:35:57.760 --> 03:35:58.760]  We need proper surveillance
[03:35:59.760 --> 03:36:00.760]  We have people that truly are evil
[03:36:01.760 --> 03:36:02.760]  And they're coming from some place
[03:36:03.760 --> 03:36:04.760]  And you know sort of where they're coming from
[03:36:05.760 --> 03:36:06.760]  At least the vicinity
[03:36:06.760 --> 03:36:08.760]  And we have to look at ourselves
[03:36:09.760 --> 03:36:10.760]  We have to be surveilled
[03:36:11.760 --> 03:36:12.760]  And we have to see what's coming at us
[03:36:13.760 --> 03:36:14.760]  Because we're not going to have a country anymore
[03:36:15.760 --> 03:36:16.760]  Between the weak borders that we have
[03:36:17.760 --> 03:36:18.760]  The pathetic and weak borders where politicians
[03:36:19.760 --> 03:36:20.760]  Are afraid to do anything about it
[03:36:21.760 --> 03:36:22.760]  Between all of what's happening with radical
[03:36:23.760 --> 03:36:24.760]  You know, you look at what's going on
[03:36:25.760 --> 03:36:26.760]  You have a president that doesn't even want to talk
[03:36:27.760 --> 03:36:28.760]  About, you know, the radical Muslim stuff
[03:36:29.760 --> 03:36:30.760]  He doesn't want to mention the word
[03:36:31.760 --> 03:36:32.760]  He doesn't want to say it
[03:36:33.760 --> 03:36:34.760]  But you look at what's happening
[03:36:34.760 --> 03:36:35.760]  Where they're celebrating global warming
[03:36:36.760 --> 03:36:37.760]  And trying to get everybody excited
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:39.760]  About global warming
[03:36:40.760 --> 03:36:41.760]  Like that's our number one problem
[03:36:42.760 --> 03:36:43.760]  He considers that to be our number one problem
[03:36:44.760 --> 03:36:45.760]  And our number one problem is what's going on
[03:36:46.760 --> 03:36:47.760]  Where they want to blow up our cities
[03:36:48.760 --> 03:36:49.760]  And they want to blow up our country
[03:36:50.760 --> 03:36:51.760]  That's our number one problem
[03:36:52.760 --> 03:36:53.760]  And then our number two problem is Crippled America
[03:36:54.760 --> 03:36:55.760]  Your number one New York Times best seller
[03:36:56.760 --> 03:36:57.760]  We're going to talk about that in a few minutes
[03:36:58.760 --> 03:36:59.760]  But let's continue with the number one problem
[03:37:00.760 --> 03:37:01.760]  And I agree with you
[03:37:01.760 --> 03:37:03.760]  There's an associated press and others are reporting
[03:37:04.760 --> 03:37:06.760]  That it's a secret deal with Turkey
[03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:08.760]  With the Germans
[03:37:09.760 --> 03:37:10.760]  With Merkel, the admitted socialist
[03:37:11.760 --> 03:37:13.760]  To bring in millions of radical Islamists
[03:37:14.760 --> 03:37:15.760]  They admit almost all of them are Sunni
[03:37:16.760 --> 03:37:17.760]  That basically invaded Syria
[03:37:18.760 --> 03:37:19.760]  They're getting their butt kicked by the Russians
[03:37:20.760 --> 03:37:21.760]  So now they want to flee up to the north
[03:37:22.760 --> 03:37:23.760]  Into Turkey
[03:37:24.760 --> 03:37:25.760]  You said months ago bomb the oil of ISIS
[03:37:26.760 --> 03:37:27.760]  And the mainstream media laugh
[03:37:28.760 --> 03:37:29.760]  Because you said the sky was blue again
[03:37:29.760 --> 03:37:30.760]  And now the Pentagon says that's the right thing to do
[03:37:31.760 --> 03:37:33.760]  And now you've come out saying quote
[03:37:34.760 --> 03:37:37.760]  It looks like that Turkey's on the side of ISIS
[03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:39.760]  Closed quote
[03:37:40.760 --> 03:37:41.760]  Well, the next day the Russians release satellite photos
[03:37:42.760 --> 03:37:44.760]  Documenting that there are literally thousands of trucks
[03:37:45.760 --> 03:37:46.760]  Coming up to the border
[03:37:47.760 --> 03:37:48.760]  At these huge terminals
[03:37:49.760 --> 03:37:50.760]  Connected to air gun
[03:37:51.760 --> 03:37:52.760]  The president's son
[03:37:53.760 --> 03:37:54.760]  Making billions of dollars total off of this
[03:37:55.760 --> 03:37:56.760]  Again, you're in trouble for saying the sky is blue
[03:37:56.760 --> 03:37:57.760]  Well, I was right about that
[03:37:58.760 --> 03:37:59.760]  I was right in saying in a book that I wrote
[03:38:00.760 --> 03:38:01.760]  You covered it really nicely
[03:38:02.760 --> 03:38:03.760]  I appreciated it
[03:38:04.760 --> 03:38:05.760]  But I wrote a very political book years ago
[03:38:06.760 --> 03:38:07.760]  In the year 2000
[03:38:08.760 --> 03:38:09.760]  The America We Deserve
[03:38:10.760 --> 03:38:11.760]  And I said to that book that
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:13.760]  We better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden
[03:38:14.760 --> 03:38:15.760]  I mean, I really study this stuff
[03:38:16.760 --> 03:38:17.760]  I really find it very interesting
[03:38:18.760 --> 03:38:19.760]  And even though I'm a businessman
[03:38:20.760 --> 03:38:21.760]  I find it, I've always found
[03:38:22.760 --> 03:38:23.760]  I've always been involved in politics
[03:38:23.760 --> 03:38:25.760]  I've always been involved with Osama bin Laden
[03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:27.760]  There's a guy named Osama bin Laden
[03:38:28.760 --> 03:38:29.760]  Nobody really knew who he was
[03:38:30.760 --> 03:38:31.760]  But he was nasty
[03:38:32.760 --> 03:38:33.760]  He was saying really nasty things about our country
[03:38:34.760 --> 03:38:35.760]  And what he wants to do to it
[03:38:36.760 --> 03:38:37.760]  And I wrote in the book 2000
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:39.760]  Two years before the World Trade Center came down
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:41.760]  I talked to you about Osama bin Laden
[03:38:42.760 --> 03:38:43.760]  You better take him out
[03:38:44.760 --> 03:38:45.760]  I said he's going to crawl under a rock
[03:38:46.760 --> 03:38:47.760]  You better take him out
[03:38:48.760 --> 03:38:49.760]  And now people are seeing that
[03:38:50.760 --> 03:38:51.760]  They're saying, you know, Trump predicted
[03:38:51.760 --> 03:38:52.760]  We talked about terrorism and that
[03:38:53.760 --> 03:38:54.760]  That was before terrorism as we know it today
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:38:56.760]  I said we better be careful
[03:38:57.760 --> 03:38:58.760]  That's going to happen, it's going to be a big thing
[03:38:59.760 --> 03:39:00.760]  And it certainly is a big thing
[03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:02.760]  So with the oil and I'm glad you brought it up
[03:39:03.760 --> 03:39:04.760]  But as you know for three years I've been saying
[03:39:05.760 --> 03:39:06.760]  You better take out the oil
[03:39:07.760 --> 03:39:08.760]  Because if you don't take the oil
[03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:10.760]  It's going to be a problem
[03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:12.760]  So we shouldn't have been in Iraq
[03:39:13.760 --> 03:39:14.760]  But once we got there
[03:39:15.760 --> 03:39:16.760]  The way we came out was horrible
[03:39:17.760 --> 03:39:18.760]  And I said take the oil
[03:39:18.760 --> 03:39:20.760]  And as you know Iran is getting the oil
[03:39:21.760 --> 03:39:22.760]  Because Iran is going to take over all of Iraq
[03:39:23.760 --> 03:39:24.760]  You know, we made one of the worst deals
[03:39:25.760 --> 03:39:26.760]  In the history of our world
[03:39:27.760 --> 03:39:28.760]  When we gave them $150 billion
[03:39:29.760 --> 03:39:31.760]  And virtually we gave them keys to nuclear weapons
[03:39:32.760 --> 03:39:33.760]  I hate to interrupt you
[03:39:34.760 --> 03:39:35.760]  You are the leading presidential front runner
[03:39:36.760 --> 03:39:37.760]  With the Republicans
[03:39:38.760 --> 03:39:39.760]  Gaining a huge lead as you don't back down
[03:39:40.760 --> 03:39:41.760]  But I've got to just back you up again
[03:39:42.760 --> 03:39:43.760]  Because the more I research what you've actually said
[03:39:44.760 --> 03:39:45.760]  And done, it's amazing
[03:39:45.760 --> 03:39:47.760]  The leading American figure
[03:39:48.760 --> 03:39:49.760]  Who openly said do not go to war in Iraq
[03:39:50.760 --> 03:39:51.760]  They had almost what 90% votes
[03:39:52.760 --> 03:39:53.760]  In Congress for it by partisan
[03:39:54.760 --> 03:39:55.760]  You said don't do it
[03:39:56.760 --> 03:39:57.760]  Iran will take over
[03:39:58.760 --> 03:39:59.760]  I mean look you can say that today
[03:40:00.760 --> 03:40:01.760]  And everybody can say that
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:03.760]  But you said that in 2001, 2002, 2003
[03:40:04.760 --> 03:40:05.760]  When it was very unpopular
[03:40:06.760 --> 03:40:07.760]  Because you've done your research
[03:40:08.760 --> 03:40:09.760]  And had good advisors
[03:40:10.760 --> 03:40:11.760]  How did you know that when almost no one else did
[03:40:12.760 --> 03:40:13.760]  Well first of all
[03:40:13.760 --> 03:40:14.760]  As a domestic person there is
[03:40:15.760 --> 03:40:16.760]  I'm going to build the mill if I win
[03:40:17.760 --> 03:40:18.760]  I'm going to make our military so strong
[03:40:19.760 --> 03:40:20.760]  So powerful that nobody's going to mess with us
[03:40:21.760 --> 03:40:22.760]  We're going to take care of our vets and all of that
[03:40:23.760 --> 03:40:24.760]  But I have to tell you you have to know
[03:40:25.760 --> 03:40:26.760]  If you're going to go to war you have to do it properly
[03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:28.760]  And you have to know what to do
[03:40:29.760 --> 03:40:30.760]  I've viewed it as this
[03:40:31.760 --> 03:40:32.760]  Iran and Iraq were the same in terms of strength
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:34.760]  And they'd constantly fighting
[03:40:35.760 --> 03:40:36.760]  That's all they do is they fight
[03:40:37.760 --> 03:40:38.760]  They go to war all the time
[03:40:39.760 --> 03:40:40.760]  And they'd move 10 feet left, 10 feet right
[03:40:40.760 --> 03:40:42.760]  And again, four years left
[03:40:43.760 --> 03:40:44.760]  This has been gone on forever
[03:40:45.760 --> 03:40:46.760]  And this is the way it is
[03:40:47.760 --> 03:40:48.760]  I said if you take out Iran
[03:40:49.760 --> 03:40:50.760]  Or if you take out Iraq
[03:40:51.760 --> 03:40:52.760]  Either one, you're going to destabilize the Middle East
[03:40:53.760 --> 03:40:54.760]  Well we took out Iraq
[03:40:55.760 --> 03:40:56.760]  And by the way
[03:40:57.760 --> 03:40:58.760]  Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world
[03:40:59.760 --> 03:41:00.760]  People don't even know that
[03:41:01.760 --> 03:41:02.760]  So we gave like incredible
[03:41:03.760 --> 03:41:04.760]  We took out Iraq
[03:41:05.760 --> 03:41:06.760]  I said you're going to destabilize
[03:41:07.760 --> 03:41:08.760]  And I said and you'll know this
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:09.760]  Iran is going to come in
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:11.760]  And Iran is going to take over Iraq
[03:41:12.760 --> 03:41:13.760]  And they're just taking it over
[03:41:14.760 --> 03:41:15.760]  Right now as we speak they're taking it over
[03:41:16.760 --> 03:41:17.760]  Iran is running Iraq
[03:41:18.760 --> 03:41:19.760]  And very soon we'll be virtually
[03:41:20.760 --> 03:41:21.760]  Going to be totally running Iraq
[03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:23.760]  Especially after all of the deal we just made
[03:41:24.760 --> 03:41:25.760]  Which is the worst
[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:27.760]  So I said keep the oil
[03:41:28.760 --> 03:41:29.760]  And I said if you're going to leave
[03:41:30.760 --> 03:41:31.760]  You shouldn't have gone in
[03:41:32.760 --> 03:41:33.760]  But they should have left soldiers behind
[03:41:34.760 --> 03:41:35.760]  Like 20,000 or certain number of soldiers
[03:41:35.760 --> 03:41:37.760]  Then they left they didn't take the oil
[03:41:38.760 --> 03:41:39.760]  So ISIS got the oil
[03:41:40.760 --> 03:41:41.760]  Iran is getting the oil
[03:41:42.760 --> 03:41:43.760]  Everybody is getting everything but us
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:45.760]  So we lost thousands of soldiers
[03:41:46.760 --> 03:41:47.760]  We spent two trillion dollars in Iraq
[03:41:48.760 --> 03:41:49.760]  We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place
[03:41:50.760 --> 03:41:51.760]  And what do we get out of it
[03:41:52.760 --> 03:41:53.760]  We had nothing
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:41:55.760]  No the French and the Germans are getting the oil
[03:41:56.760 --> 03:41:57.760]  And the Iranians are getting the oil
[03:41:58.760 --> 03:41:59.760]  And you know who the number one customer for the oil is
[03:42:00.760 --> 03:42:01.760]  Guess what, China
[03:42:02.760 --> 03:42:03.760]  That's right
[03:42:03.760 --> 03:42:04.760]  China is smart as on trade
[03:42:05.760 --> 03:42:06.760]  Like we're losing
[03:42:07.760 --> 03:42:08.760]  We have a $450 billion trade deficit
[03:42:09.760 --> 03:42:10.760]  Let me ask you this
[03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:12.760]  You're a top business guy on your own
[03:42:13.760 --> 03:42:14.760]  From nothing
[03:42:15.760 --> 03:42:17.760]  How did China get 97% of rare earth minerals in the world
[03:42:18.760 --> 03:42:19.760]  How is the United States or nobody else
[03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:21.760]  Even trying to get rare earth minerals
[03:42:22.760 --> 03:42:23.760]  When it's what goes in the smart phones
[03:42:24.760 --> 03:42:25.760]  The computers, trillions is made a year
[03:42:26.760 --> 03:42:27.760]  How did we just give them the global market
[03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:29.760]  In that, that's crazy
[03:42:30.760 --> 03:42:31.760]  Well what a lot of people don't know Afghanistan
[03:42:31.760 --> 03:42:32.760]  Afghanistan is a place we can go in
[03:42:33.760 --> 03:42:34.760]  Because you know you have Pakistan
[03:42:35.760 --> 03:42:36.760]  And you have nuclear weapons
[03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:38.760]  A lot of things going on there
[03:42:39.760 --> 03:42:40.760]  But we go into Afghanistan
[03:42:41.760 --> 03:42:42.760]  We're fighting tremendous mountains and ridges
[03:42:43.760 --> 03:42:44.760]  We're fighting on one side
[03:42:45.760 --> 03:42:46.760]  And you know who's got their excavators
[03:42:47.760 --> 03:42:48.760]  On the other side
[03:42:49.760 --> 03:42:50.760]  China is looking out all the minerals
[03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:52.760]  You know Afghanistan, nobody knew this
[03:42:53.760 --> 03:42:54.760]  Afghanistan is rich with minerals
[03:42:55.760 --> 03:42:56.760]  Not oil but minerals
[03:42:57.760 --> 03:42:58.760]  And China is taking out all the minerals
[03:42:58.760 --> 03:43:00.760]  Trillions, like a trillion dollars in Afghanistan
[03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:02.760]  And we get nothing out of it
[03:43:03.760 --> 03:43:04.760]  And we're going to end up leaving
[03:43:05.760 --> 03:43:06.760]  And keeping a couple of thousand soldiers there
[03:43:07.760 --> 03:43:08.760]  We get nothing
[03:43:09.760 --> 03:43:10.760]  China is taking out the minerals
[03:43:11.760 --> 03:43:12.760]  They're the buyers, the big buyers
[03:43:13.760 --> 03:43:14.760]  At very very low prices of
[03:43:15.760 --> 03:43:16.760]  As you know of the oil in Iraq
[03:43:17.760 --> 03:43:18.760]  And probably in Syria
[03:43:19.760 --> 03:43:20.760]  But China is a big buyer of the oil
[03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:22.760]  But one thing with the oil
[03:43:23.760 --> 03:43:24.760]  Because you've covered it
[03:43:25.760 --> 03:43:26.760]  For three years I've been saying hit the oil
[03:43:26.760 --> 03:43:27.760]  And I've seen it on TV
[03:43:28.760 --> 03:43:29.760]  As the president said
[03:43:30.760 --> 03:43:31.760]  And they're certainly not contained
[03:43:32.760 --> 03:43:33.760]  But I said hit the oil and hit them hard
[03:43:34.760 --> 03:43:35.760]  And they left at me
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:37.760]  And they would put generals on television
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:39.760]  Saying no that strategy wouldn't work
[03:43:40.760 --> 03:43:41.760]  Well after Paris they started hitting the oil
[03:43:42.760 --> 03:43:43.760]  And it does work
[03:43:44.760 --> 03:43:45.760]  The problem is we've given them a two year edge
[03:43:46.760 --> 03:43:47.760]  Billions of dollars
[03:43:48.760 --> 03:43:49.760]  The Russians started hitting the oil for one month
[03:43:50.760 --> 03:43:51.760]  And ISIS is already rolling over
[03:43:52.760 --> 03:43:53.760]  So Putin is following your strategy
[03:43:53.760 --> 03:43:55.760]  That's the only problem
[03:43:56.760 --> 03:43:57.760]  Donald Trump joins us live
[03:43:58.760 --> 03:43:59.760]  Can you speak to as president
[03:44:00.760 --> 03:44:01.760]  What your relationship would be with foreign leaders
[03:44:02.760 --> 03:44:03.760]  And what you know about Vladimir Putin
[03:44:04.760 --> 03:44:05.760]  Because all I know is
[03:44:06.760 --> 03:44:07.760]  Why are we starting a fight with Russia
[03:44:08.760 --> 03:44:09.760]  When they're not doing anything to us
[03:44:10.760 --> 03:44:11.760]  Right, well number one
[03:44:12.760 --> 03:44:13.760]  And just to finish on the other way
[03:44:14.760 --> 03:44:15.760]  I say hit the oil but we should keep the oil
[03:44:16.760 --> 03:44:17.760]  In other words we should keep
[03:44:18.760 --> 03:44:19.760]  We'll get ExxonMobil, they'll go in
[03:44:20.760 --> 03:44:21.760]  We'll get other of our oil companies
[03:44:21.760 --> 03:44:22.760]  They'll go along the spoils
[03:44:23.760 --> 03:44:24.760]  We don't have that
[03:44:25.760 --> 03:44:26.760]  We go in, we fight a war and we leave
[03:44:27.760 --> 03:44:28.760]  We get nothing except we get death
[03:44:29.760 --> 03:44:30.760]  And we get deficit, that's all we get
[03:44:31.760 --> 03:44:32.760]  I think I get along great with people
[03:44:33.760 --> 03:44:34.760]  I mean I will probably get along well with him
[03:44:35.760 --> 03:44:36.760]  And if I don't somebody else will
[03:44:37.760 --> 03:44:38.760]  And who knows, you know he's a difficult cookie
[03:44:39.760 --> 03:44:40.760]  He's tough and he's smart
[03:44:41.760 --> 03:44:42.760]  I was on the show 60 minutes with him
[03:44:43.760 --> 03:44:44.760]  Recently, not together
[03:44:45.760 --> 03:44:46.760]  I mean they did him and they profiled me
[03:44:47.760 --> 03:44:48.760]  At the same show which was there
[03:44:48.760 --> 03:44:50.760]  I know very well with him, I think it's too fine
[03:44:51.760 --> 03:44:52.760]  Look, here's the thing
[03:44:53.760 --> 03:44:54.760]  We lose with every country
[03:44:55.760 --> 03:44:56.760]  And yet we don't get along with any countries
[03:44:57.760 --> 03:44:58.760]  China is killing us, everybody is killing us
[03:44:59.760 --> 03:45:00.760]  China is just beating us to a pulp and trade
[03:45:01.760 --> 03:45:02.760]  Japan, Mexico is killing us
[03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:04.760]  And yet we don't get along with anybody
[03:45:05.760 --> 03:45:06.760]  With me, they're not going to get so rich
[03:45:07.760 --> 03:45:08.760]  Believe me, they're not going to get so rich at all
[03:45:09.760 --> 03:45:10.760]  We're going to take back our jobs
[03:45:11.760 --> 03:45:12.760]  We're going to take back our manufacture
[03:45:13.760 --> 03:45:14.760]  We take back our base
[03:45:15.760 --> 03:45:16.760]  But they'll like us more than they do now
[03:45:16.760 --> 03:45:17.760]  But let me say this, my audience
[03:45:18.760 --> 03:45:19.760]  I'd say 90% supports you
[03:45:20.760 --> 03:45:22.760]  And you definitely have shown
[03:45:23.760 --> 03:45:25.760]  Your knowledge of geopolitical systems
[03:45:26.760 --> 03:45:27.760]  Hillary and others have been demonizing you
[03:45:28.760 --> 03:45:29.760]  For saying radical Muslims celebrated on 9-11
[03:45:30.760 --> 03:45:32.760]  But she got caught a few years ago
[03:45:33.760 --> 03:45:34.760]  Claiming that she got shot at in Bosnia
[03:45:35.760 --> 03:45:36.760]  In the air, on the ground
[03:45:37.760 --> 03:45:38.760]  They have video of it all
[03:45:39.760 --> 03:45:40.760]  None of it happened, she admits she lied
[03:45:41.760 --> 03:45:42.760]  If you did that, you'd be done
[03:45:43.760 --> 03:45:44.760]  But you wouldn't do something like that
[03:45:44.760 --> 03:45:45.760]  You wouldn't do something like that
[03:45:46.760 --> 03:45:47.760]  But they demonize you for made-up scandals
[03:45:48.760 --> 03:45:49.760]  Every day, trying to see what'll stick
[03:45:50.760 --> 03:45:51.760]  And then you've got Hillary involved
[03:45:52.760 --> 03:45:53.760]  In Benghazi, you've got him involved in everything
[03:45:54.760 --> 03:45:55.760]  And people love you for tough talk
[03:45:56.760 --> 03:45:57.760]  Is it not time for impeachment hearings
[03:45:58.760 --> 03:45:59.760]  Against Obama?
[03:46:00.760 --> 03:46:01.760]  I mean, what do we do politically
[03:46:02.760 --> 03:46:03.760]  To really try to prosecute Hillary Clinton?
[03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:05.760]  Well, you remember this
[03:46:06.760 --> 03:46:07.760]  The best thing that we have going with Obama
[03:46:08.760 --> 03:46:09.760]  Is he's got a year left, okay
[03:46:10.760 --> 03:46:11.760]  Because by the time you do the hearings
[03:46:11.760 --> 03:46:12.760]  You're going to be doing everything
[03:46:13.760 --> 03:46:14.760]  You don't make him a martyr
[03:46:15.760 --> 03:46:16.760]  In a way, you'll make him a martyr
[03:46:17.760 --> 03:46:18.760]  But I don't even say that
[03:46:19.760 --> 03:46:20.760]  You know, one of the things that I'm the most disappointed
[03:46:21.760 --> 03:46:22.760]  In Republicans, because they go to Washington
[03:46:23.760 --> 03:46:24.760]  They're going to do all this stuff
[03:46:25.760 --> 03:46:26.760]  They're going to impeach Obama
[03:46:27.760 --> 03:46:28.760]  They're going to end Obamacare
[03:46:29.760 --> 03:46:30.760]  Which has to be ended
[03:46:31.760 --> 03:46:32.760]  I don't know if you've seen the premiums
[03:46:33.760 --> 03:46:34.760]  It's killing everything
[03:46:35.760 --> 03:46:36.760]  It's going to implode anyway
[03:46:37.760 --> 03:46:38.760]  In 2017, Obamacare blows up
[03:46:38.760 --> 03:46:40.760]  Everybody knows it, and they're doing big stories
[03:46:41.760 --> 03:46:42.760]  Even the ones that were for it are saying
[03:46:43.760 --> 03:46:44.760]  Uh-oh, this isn't working
[03:46:45.760 --> 03:46:46.760]  Well, the premiums are a disaster
[03:46:47.760 --> 03:46:48.760]  And if you look at anything having to do
[03:46:49.760 --> 03:46:50.760]  With Obamacare right now, it's over
[03:46:51.760 --> 03:46:52.760]  But the problem with the Republicans is
[03:46:53.760 --> 03:46:54.760]  They'll try and fix it
[03:46:55.760 --> 03:46:56.760]  Instead of get rid of it
[03:46:57.760 --> 03:46:58.760]  And we can come up with a phenomenal plan
[03:46:59.760 --> 03:47:00.760]  That's much better for the people
[03:47:01.760 --> 03:47:02.760]  The people are getting killed with that
[03:47:03.760 --> 03:47:04.760]  So there's so many things to do, Alex
[03:47:05.760 --> 03:47:06.760]  We will do such a good job
[03:47:06.760 --> 03:47:07.760]  But remember, we'll win on trade
[03:47:08.760 --> 03:47:09.760]  We're going to strengthen our military
[03:47:10.760 --> 03:47:11.760]  We're going to take care of our vets
[03:47:12.760 --> 03:47:13.760]  We're going to get rid of Obamacare
[03:47:14.760 --> 03:47:15.760]  There's so many things that can be done
[03:47:16.760 --> 03:47:17.760]  But we have to use our good people
[03:47:18.760 --> 03:47:19.760]  You know, everybody running against me
[03:47:20.760 --> 03:47:21.760]  In terms of even the Republican side
[03:47:22.760 --> 03:47:23.760]  And Hillary, certainly
[03:47:24.760 --> 03:47:25.760]  They're all controlled by their donors
[03:47:26.760 --> 03:47:27.760]  And their special interests
[03:47:28.760 --> 03:47:29.760]  And the lobbyists
[03:47:30.760 --> 03:47:31.760]  I'm putting up my own money
[03:47:32.760 --> 03:47:33.760]  I'm funding my own campaign
[03:47:33.760 --> 03:47:35.760]  Listen, I get it
[03:47:36.760 --> 03:47:37.760]  I mean, you are a true Maverick
[03:47:38.760 --> 03:47:39.760]  I understand you made tens of billions of dollars
[03:47:40.760 --> 03:47:41.760]  You've hired tens of thousands of people
[03:47:42.760 --> 03:47:43.760]  I mean, I would imagine that as you've gotten older
[03:47:44.760 --> 03:47:45.760]  Correct me if I'm wrong
[03:47:46.760 --> 03:47:47.760]  Because I know you talked about wanting to serve America
[03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:49.760]  Decades ago, really all it comes down to
[03:47:50.760 --> 03:47:51.760]  Is wanting to have a free country for your children
[03:47:52.760 --> 03:47:53.760]  And grandchildren
[03:47:54.760 --> 03:47:55.760]  And that's where I want to come to this point next
[03:47:56.760 --> 03:47:57.760]  Because I know you're smart, sir
[03:47:58.760 --> 03:47:59.760]  And I know that you also, though
[03:48:00.760 --> 03:48:01.760]  You don't dumb your message down
[03:48:01.760 --> 03:48:02.760]  And the establishment as well can get it
[03:48:03.760 --> 03:48:04.760]  But let's get down to brass tacks
[03:48:05.760 --> 03:48:06.760]  I routinely talk to the top generals
[03:48:09.760 --> 03:48:10.760]  Special forces
[03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:12.760]  Pentagon currently
[03:48:13.760 --> 03:48:14.760]  Out of the Pentagon, CIA
[03:48:15.760 --> 03:48:16.760]  As I know you do
[03:48:17.760 --> 03:48:18.760]  And we'll just leave it at that
[03:48:19.760 --> 03:48:20.760]  There are a lot of people in this government
[03:48:21.760 --> 03:48:22.760]  And also retired who don't want to destroy the country
[03:48:23.760 --> 03:48:24.760]  They really know that we've reached the crossroads
[03:48:25.760 --> 03:48:26.760]  Where the country's done as a third world nation
[03:48:27.760 --> 03:48:28.760]  Within a few more years
[03:48:28.760 --> 03:48:30.760]  We're done, I mean, we're talking about resurrecting the debt here
[03:48:31.760 --> 03:48:32.760]  We could turn it around right now
[03:48:33.760 --> 03:48:34.760]  As you've said properly, you're dead on, sir
[03:48:35.760 --> 03:48:36.760]  You're right, we could turn it around
[03:48:37.760 --> 03:48:38.760]  All the actuaries, all the numbers show it
[03:48:39.760 --> 03:48:40.760]  But it's got to happen the next few years and we're done
[03:48:41.760 --> 03:48:42.760]  And there are globalists that want to have a world government
[03:48:43.760 --> 03:48:44.760]  A system run by select crony capitalists
[03:48:45.760 --> 03:48:47.760]  Using socialism at the grassroots to make people dependent
[03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:49.760]  And I've talked to not just high level folks
[03:48:50.760 --> 03:48:51.760]  That have been in government that are on your team
[03:48:52.760 --> 03:48:54.760]  But separately, high level people in government currently
[03:48:55.760 --> 03:48:56.760]  That say there's an internal war going on
[03:48:56.760 --> 03:48:57.760]  And that you're a manifestation of that
[03:48:58.760 --> 03:48:59.760]  I don't want to get anything inside baseball with you
[03:49:00.760 --> 03:49:01.760]  But I already know the inside baseball
[03:49:02.760 --> 03:49:03.760]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real
[03:49:04.760 --> 03:49:05.760]  And you understand you're in danger
[03:49:06.760 --> 03:49:07.760]  And you understand what you're doing is epic
[03:49:08.760 --> 03:49:09.760]  It's George Washington level
[03:49:10.760 --> 03:49:11.760]  And you understand that office
[03:49:12.760 --> 03:49:13.760]  So I want to tell you right now
[03:49:14.760 --> 03:49:15.760]  Can you speak about the war for the soul of this country
[03:49:16.760 --> 03:49:17.760]  That's happening right now
[03:49:18.760 --> 03:49:19.760]  And really tell people what's happening
[03:49:20.760 --> 03:49:21.760]  And commit to people that you won't Ross Perot
[03:49:22.760 --> 03:49:24.760]  Under death threats and step down
[03:49:24.760 --> 03:49:25.760]  When you're in the lead two months from the election
[03:49:26.760 --> 03:49:27.760]  Okay, so let me just tell you Alex
[03:49:28.760 --> 03:49:29.760]  As you know I'm leading in every pole nationally
[03:49:30.760 --> 03:49:31.760]  In every pole state
[03:49:32.760 --> 03:49:33.760]  I'm leading in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina
[03:49:34.760 --> 03:49:35.760]  The SEC, Texas
[03:49:36.760 --> 03:49:37.760]  I'm leading in Texas which I love
[03:49:38.760 --> 03:49:39.760]  I love Texas, you know we were there
[03:49:40.760 --> 03:49:41.760]  Mark Cuban called up
[03:49:42.760 --> 03:49:43.760]  He said do you want to use the arena
[03:49:44.760 --> 03:49:45.760]  We filled it up in three or four days
[03:49:46.760 --> 03:49:47.760]  20,000 people
[03:49:48.760 --> 03:49:49.760]  In Mobile, Alabama
[03:49:50.760 --> 03:49:51.760]  We had 35,000 people
[03:49:51.760 --> 03:49:53.760]  We had 20,000 in Oklahoma
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:49:55.760]  I'm so into this
[03:49:56.760 --> 03:49:57.760]  And I'm not into it
[03:49:58.760 --> 03:49:59.760]  You know I could do other things that I would enjoy doing
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:01.760]  To be honest with you
[03:50:02.760 --> 03:50:03.760]  No, you're doing a dangerous mission
[03:50:04.760 --> 03:50:05.760]  We understand that
[03:50:06.760 --> 03:50:07.760]  It's not an easy thing
[03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:09.760]  But the key is make America great again
[03:50:10.760 --> 03:50:11.760]  We can make America great again
[03:50:12.760 --> 03:50:13.760]  But if you have to suffer through four more
[03:50:14.760 --> 03:50:15.760]  Or eight more years of what's gone on in the past
[03:50:16.760 --> 03:50:17.760]  And you know what's going on
[03:50:18.760 --> 03:50:19.760]  We're being eaten away
[03:50:19.760 --> 03:50:20.760]  In my opinion
[03:50:21.760 --> 03:50:22.760]  We can make America greater than ever before
[03:50:23.760 --> 03:50:24.760]  But we have to get going
[03:50:25.760 --> 03:50:26.760]  It has to happen, we have to get going
[03:50:27.760 --> 03:50:28.760]  And you know when you look at the vision
[03:50:29.760 --> 03:50:30.760]  I said Iraq, you agreed with me on Iraq
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:32.760]  I said hit the oil
[03:50:33.760 --> 03:50:34.760]  I said a lot of things that turned out to be true
[03:50:35.760 --> 03:50:36.760]  100% true
[03:50:37.760 --> 03:50:38.760]  And I'm giving credit
[03:50:39.760 --> 03:50:40.760]  I'm giving credit by some people
[03:50:41.760 --> 03:50:42.760]  Some people refuse to acknowledge it
[03:50:43.760 --> 03:50:44.760]  You know they refuse to say
[03:50:45.760 --> 03:50:46.760]  You've been absolutely on target
[03:50:46.760 --> 03:50:48.760]  Right now though because you've talked about it
[03:50:49.760 --> 03:50:50.760]  Are we on a crossroads to decide
[03:50:51.760 --> 03:50:52.760]  Whether this country is done
[03:50:53.760 --> 03:50:54.760]  Or whether we go to the next level
[03:50:55.760 --> 03:50:56.760]  Well I think this
[03:50:57.760 --> 03:50:58.760]  I think that sadly I think that if we don't get it right this time
[03:50:59.760 --> 03:51:00.760]  I think this is going to be the most important election
[03:51:01.760 --> 03:51:02.760]  Our country has ever had
[03:51:03.760 --> 03:51:04.760]  I mean you have to say George Washington is right there
[03:51:05.760 --> 03:51:06.760]  You know the couple of pretty important elections
[03:51:07.760 --> 03:51:08.760]  But this is certainly in the last
[03:51:09.760 --> 03:51:10.760]  In the modern era this is the most important election
[03:51:11.760 --> 03:51:12.760]  Our country has ever had
[03:51:13.760 --> 03:51:14.760]  If we don't get it right
[03:51:14.760 --> 03:51:15.760]  I mean Hillary
[03:51:16.760 --> 03:51:17.760]  I mean she's so corrupt
[03:51:18.760 --> 03:51:19.760]  She's so corrupt
[03:51:20.760 --> 03:51:21.760]  And she shouldn't even be allowed to run
[03:51:22.760 --> 03:51:23.760]  And frankly her greatest legacy
[03:51:24.760 --> 03:51:25.760]  She was a horrible Secretary of State
[03:51:26.760 --> 03:51:27.760]  If she runs
[03:51:28.760 --> 03:51:29.760]  I think her greatest legacy will be
[03:51:30.760 --> 03:51:31.760]  That she got out of the email scandal
[03:51:32.760 --> 03:51:33.760]  That's what I think
[03:51:34.760 --> 03:51:35.760]  It'll be one of the greatest jobs I've ever seen
[03:51:36.760 --> 03:51:37.760]  Of getting out of a scandal
[03:51:38.760 --> 03:51:39.760]  Because General Petraeus and many others
[03:51:40.760 --> 03:51:41.760]  I mean their lives have been destroyed
[03:51:41.760 --> 03:51:43.760]  She shouldn't be allowed to run
[03:51:44.760 --> 03:51:45.760]  But you know the recent Fox poll that just came down
[03:51:46.760 --> 03:51:47.760]  Two days ago has been beating her head to head
[03:51:48.760 --> 03:51:49.760]  Which is very interesting and very good
[03:51:50.760 --> 03:51:51.760]  And beating her soundly head to head
[03:51:52.760 --> 03:51:53.760]  But we have to get it right
[03:51:54.760 --> 03:51:55.760]  Our country can be absolutely
[03:51:56.760 --> 03:51:57.760]  We can turn it around
[03:51:58.760 --> 03:51:59.760]  But I would agree with you
[03:52:00.760 --> 03:52:01.760]  If we don't get it right this time
[03:52:02.760 --> 03:52:03.760]  I'm not sure if you go another four or eight years
[03:52:04.760 --> 03:52:05.760]  With the insanity and the stupidity
[03:52:06.760 --> 03:52:07.760]  Of these leaders
[03:52:08.760 --> 03:52:09.760]  I'm not sure you're going to be able to turn it around anymore
[03:52:09.760 --> 03:52:10.760]  Donald Trump the man in the arena
[03:52:11.760 --> 03:52:12.760]  His new book
[03:52:13.760 --> 03:52:14.760]  We're going to talk about the moment
[03:52:15.760 --> 03:52:16.760]  Is exposing the fact this country is being sabotaged
[03:52:17.760 --> 03:52:18.760]  By design
[03:52:19.760 --> 03:52:20.760]  Specifically I don't want to bring up detractors
[03:52:21.760 --> 03:52:22.760]  And it's a question I had early on
[03:52:23.760 --> 03:52:24.760]  That I did more research and
[03:52:25.760 --> 03:52:26.760]  I understand that you really do want to save this country
[03:52:27.760 --> 03:52:28.760]  Where your children and grandchildren live
[03:52:29.760 --> 03:52:30.760]  But let's expand on this
[03:52:31.760 --> 03:52:32.760]  There are certain pundits out there
[03:52:33.760 --> 03:52:34.760]  Saying you played golf with Bill Clinton
[03:52:36.760 --> 03:52:37.760]  And so you had to do business in New York
[03:52:37.760 --> 03:52:38.760]  So you said nice things about Hillary
[03:52:39.760 --> 03:52:40.760]  I get keeping your enemies closer
[03:52:41.760 --> 03:52:42.760]  When you're not doing politics
[03:52:43.760 --> 03:52:44.760]  I get it, I understand
[03:52:44.760 --> 03:52:45.760]  I think that's what you did
[03:52:46.760 --> 03:52:47.760]  But tell us specifically
[03:52:48.760 --> 03:52:49.760]  And I don't think this now
[03:52:50.760 --> 03:52:51.760]  I've seen it, I know you're for real
[03:52:52.760 --> 03:52:53.760]  You wouldn't be saying the things you're doing
[03:52:54.760 --> 03:52:55.760]  They're scared of you
[03:52:56.760 --> 03:52:57.760]  The whole system is coming on against you
[03:52:58.760 --> 03:52:59.760]  But promise us that you're not going to
[03:53:00.760 --> 03:53:01.760]  Drop out at the key moment
[03:53:02.760 --> 03:53:03.760]  Keeping all the other Republicans out of you
[03:53:04.760 --> 03:53:05.760]  And then Hillary races to the head
[03:53:05.760 --> 03:53:06.760]  So folks are climbing you're a Clinton operative
[03:53:07.760 --> 03:53:08.760]  You know, I've never heard that
[03:53:09.760 --> 03:53:10.760]  I've heard it actually a few months ago
[03:53:11.760 --> 03:53:12.760]  But I've hit her harder than anybody
[03:53:13.760 --> 03:53:14.760]  Times ten if you look at the
[03:53:15.760 --> 03:53:16.760]  I was a businessman
[03:53:17.760 --> 03:53:18.760]  And I've only been a politician for five months
[03:53:19.760 --> 03:53:20.760]  I hate to use the term because
[03:53:21.760 --> 03:53:22.760]  You're a statesman
[03:53:23.760 --> 03:53:24.760]  But I've just been doing this for a very short period of time
[03:53:25.760 --> 03:53:26.760]  I was establishment
[03:53:27.760 --> 03:53:28.760]  You know, I was like a guy like you would say
[03:53:29.760 --> 03:53:30.760]  Trump is total establishment
[03:53:31.760 --> 03:53:32.760]  And I was a big donor to a lot of different Republicans
[03:53:32.760 --> 03:53:34.760]  But over the years I've given to Democrats
[03:53:35.760 --> 03:53:36.760]  I've given to everybody
[03:53:37.760 --> 03:53:38.760]  Because I had an obligation
[03:53:39.760 --> 03:53:40.760]  I was a businessman
[03:53:41.760 --> 03:53:42.760]  One of the magazines recently called me
[03:53:43.760 --> 03:53:44.760]  A world-class businessman
[03:53:45.760 --> 03:53:46.760]  The truth is I did
[03:53:47.760 --> 03:53:48.760]  I built an unbelievable company
[03:53:49.760 --> 03:53:50.760]  A tremendous assets
[03:53:51.760 --> 03:53:52.760]  Not only that iconic assets
[03:53:53.760 --> 03:53:54.760]  Very little debt
[03:53:55.760 --> 03:53:56.760]  Tremendous cash flow
[03:53:57.760 --> 03:53:58.760]  It's a great company
[03:53:59.760 --> 03:54:00.760]  And by the way, people now see how good
[03:54:00.760 --> 03:54:01.760]  Trump is
[03:54:02.760 --> 03:54:03.760]  Which by the way, the reason I say that
[03:54:04.760 --> 03:54:05.760]  That's the kind of thinking our country needs
[03:54:06.760 --> 03:54:07.760]  But I got along great with Clinton
[03:54:08.760 --> 03:54:09.760]  I got along great with Harry Reid
[03:54:10.760 --> 03:54:11.760]  I got along great with everybody
[03:54:12.760 --> 03:54:13.760]  Because when I needed them
[03:54:14.760 --> 03:54:15.760]  I didn't want to have an argument
[03:54:16.760 --> 03:54:17.760]  I didn't want to have somebody say
[03:54:18.760 --> 03:54:19.760]  Well, Clinton doesn't want it to happen
[03:54:20.760 --> 03:54:21.760]  You're not a loser
[03:54:22.760 --> 03:54:23.760]  You don't get in mindless fights
[03:54:24.760 --> 03:54:25.760]  You move forward with your agenda
[03:54:26.760 --> 03:54:27.760]  But now you see America in trouble
[03:54:27.760 --> 03:54:29.760]  You're a businessman, you couldn't have even functioned
[03:54:30.760 --> 03:54:31.760]  If you don't get along
[03:54:32.760 --> 03:54:33.760]  For example, in New York City, it's 95% Democrat
[03:54:34.760 --> 03:54:35.760]  I mean, if I didn't get along with the Democrats
[03:54:36.760 --> 03:54:37.760]  I wouldn't have one building on it
[03:54:38.760 --> 03:54:39.760]  I'll tell you, I mean, you did want the vice president
[03:54:40.760 --> 03:54:41.760]  You know, a position that's come out
[03:54:42.760 --> 03:54:43.760]  Decades ago behind the scenes
[03:54:44.760 --> 03:54:45.760]  And I know you're a Republican
[03:54:46.760 --> 03:54:47.760]  What about libertarianism?
[03:54:48.760 --> 03:54:49.760]  What's your view of libertarianism?
[03:54:50.760 --> 03:54:51.760]  And then I want to ask you
[03:54:52.760 --> 03:54:53.760]  Who's your favorite president
[03:54:54.760 --> 03:54:55.760]  And who do you think your running mate might be
[03:54:55.760 --> 03:54:56.760]  And what are some of the things that I really like about it
[03:54:57.760 --> 03:54:58.760]  But, you know, keeping government out
[03:54:59.760 --> 03:55:00.760]  As much as possible
[03:55:01.760 --> 03:55:02.760]  We need government for protection
[03:55:03.760 --> 03:55:04.760]  We have to protect
[03:55:05.760 --> 03:55:06.760]  When you look at these maniacs in the Middle East
[03:55:07.760 --> 03:55:08.760]  That want to destroy us
[03:55:09.760 --> 03:55:10.760]  And, you know, the problem we have today, Alex
[03:55:11.760 --> 03:55:12.760]  Is the weaponry
[03:55:13.760 --> 03:55:14.760]  If this were 100 years ago, I'd say forget about them
[03:55:15.760 --> 03:55:16.760]  Let them keep fighting
[03:55:17.760 --> 03:55:18.760]  They've been fighting all their lives
[03:55:19.760 --> 03:55:20.760]  Let them keep fighting each other
[03:55:21.760 --> 03:55:22.760]  Who cares
[03:55:22.760 --> 03:55:24.760]  So there's a certain common sense to certain elements
[03:55:25.760 --> 03:55:26.760]  And I do very well with the libertarians, frankly
[03:55:27.760 --> 03:55:28.760]  You know, because they sort of get it
[03:55:29.760 --> 03:55:30.760]  And they get me
[03:55:31.760 --> 03:55:32.760]  But we need bigger strength
[03:55:33.760 --> 03:55:34.760]  That I think the libertarians really want
[03:55:35.760 --> 03:55:36.760]  And we need it
[03:55:37.760 --> 03:55:38.760]  And we have to have it
[03:55:39.760 --> 03:55:40.760]  If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country
[03:55:41.760 --> 03:55:42.760]  If we don't have borders, we're not going to have a country
[03:55:43.760 --> 03:55:44.760]  As far as running mate is too soon to say
[03:55:45.760 --> 03:55:46.760]  I actually respect a couple of people
[03:55:47.760 --> 03:55:48.760]  That are on the stage
[03:55:49.760 --> 03:55:50.760]  Some of them have absolutely no respect for their
[03:55:50.760 --> 03:55:51.760]  All at what they do
[03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:53.760]  You look at what's going on
[03:55:54.760 --> 03:55:55.760]  But I have respect for a number of people
[03:55:56.760 --> 03:55:57.760]  That are on the stage with me
[03:55:58.760 --> 03:55:59.760]  I have respect for a lot of people
[03:56:00.760 --> 03:56:01.760]  That are throughout this country
[03:56:02.760 --> 03:56:03.760]  Political people
[03:56:04.760 --> 03:56:05.760]  I'll pick somebody I think that can really be a great vice president
[03:56:06.760 --> 03:56:07.760]  Ultimately has to be a great president
[03:56:08.760 --> 03:56:09.760]  Because that's, you know, 90% of that function
[03:56:10.760 --> 03:56:11.760]  Is, you know, if something bad happens
[03:56:12.760 --> 03:56:13.760]  They got to be a good president
[03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:15.760]  You have to view it from that standpoint
[03:56:16.760 --> 03:56:17.760]  And my favorite president in the more or less modern era
[03:56:17.760 --> 03:56:19.760]  Is Bill Reagan, I've always liked him
[03:56:20.760 --> 03:56:21.760]  And by the way, he was a Democrat
[03:56:22.760 --> 03:56:23.760]  A lot of people don't know
[03:56:24.760 --> 03:56:25.760]  Some have a liberal Democrat, Alex, as you know
[03:56:26.760 --> 03:56:27.760]  And he became a somewhat conservative
[03:56:28.760 --> 03:56:29.760]  I wouldn't say the most conservative
[03:56:30.760 --> 03:56:31.760]  But a somewhat conservative Republican
[03:56:32.760 --> 03:56:33.760]  But he wanted to make America great
[03:56:34.760 --> 03:56:35.760]  And he really did, he wanted to make
[03:56:36.760 --> 03:56:37.760]  He had actually, let's make America great
[03:56:38.760 --> 03:56:39.760]  That was his, and mine is make America great again
[03:56:40.760 --> 03:56:41.760]  So there's a little bit of a difference
[03:56:42.760 --> 03:56:43.760]  My son, my son, you know, finally sold me
[03:56:44.760 --> 03:56:45.760]  On being a bigger supporter of yours
[03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:46.760]  I love you, love Americana, you're pure Americana
[03:56:47.760 --> 03:56:48.760]  But I'm still, you know, it was research
[03:56:49.760 --> 03:56:50.760]  But my 13-year-old son's really smart
[03:56:51.760 --> 03:56:52.760]  There's a lot of research, he watches all the debates
[03:56:53.760 --> 03:56:54.760]  He just really loves you
[03:56:55.760 --> 03:56:56.760]  He is on cloud nine that you're here, Rex Jones
[03:56:57.760 --> 03:56:58.760]  And it was his question, you know
[03:56:59.760 --> 03:57:00.760]  Which president was your favorite
[03:57:01.760 --> 03:57:02.760]  But all time, all time, who's your favorite?
[03:57:03.760 --> 03:57:05.760]  Well, all time, I'd say Ronald Reagan
[03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:07.760]  Short-term, I would say
[03:57:08.760 --> 03:57:09.760]  Well, you know, you look at Lincoln
[03:57:10.760 --> 03:57:11.760]  You look at Washington, you have to go with
[03:57:12.760 --> 03:57:13.760]  They're the classics, right, Alex?
[03:57:13.760 --> 03:57:14.760]  You think in terms of the great classics
[03:57:15.760 --> 03:57:16.760]  You have to go with the Lincolns and the Washington's
[03:57:17.760 --> 03:57:19.760]  I agree with a man's man, George Washington was badass
[03:57:20.760 --> 03:57:21.760]  Yeah, that's what they say
[03:57:22.760 --> 03:57:23.760]  I mean, that's what they say
[03:57:24.760 --> 03:57:25.760]  They say he never told a lie, let's hope that's true
[03:57:26.760 --> 03:57:27.760]  Okay, but George Washington was pretty good
[03:57:28.760 --> 03:57:29.760]  But we had some, look, we had some great presidents
[03:57:30.760 --> 03:57:31.760]  And we had some good presidents on the other side too
[03:57:32.760 --> 03:57:34.760]  In all fairness, but we will hopefully
[03:57:35.760 --> 03:57:36.760]  Be right at the top of that list
[03:57:37.760 --> 03:57:38.760]  We're gonna make the country so strong
[03:57:39.760 --> 03:57:40.760]  And we're gonna make it financially secure
[03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:42.760]  We can't owe 21 trillion dollars
[03:57:43.760 --> 03:57:43.760]  Because it's gonna be that number
[03:57:44.760 --> 03:57:45.760]  That's my final question
[03:57:46.760 --> 03:57:47.760]  What type of an elite wants a clowered and piven
[03:57:48.760 --> 03:57:49.760]  Bankrupt the country so socialists can run in
[03:57:50.760 --> 03:57:51.760]  And we all get handouts
[03:57:52.760 --> 03:57:53.760]  What type of an elite is that?
[03:57:54.760 --> 03:57:55.760]  I mean, you've been around these people
[03:57:56.760 --> 03:57:57.760]  Are they mentally ill, Donald Trump?
[03:57:58.760 --> 03:57:59.760]  Well, we have to make our country rich again
[03:58:00.760 --> 03:58:01.760]  You know, the other day I said to a woman
[03:58:02.760 --> 03:58:03.760]  She came up to Mr. Trump at a big rally
[03:58:04.760 --> 03:58:05.760]  Where we had 14,000 people
[03:58:06.760 --> 03:58:07.760]  And at the end, she just used me
[03:58:07.760 --> 03:58:09.760]  And she said, Mr. Trump, I'm voting for you 100%
[03:58:10.760 --> 03:58:12.760]  But are you this whole concept of making it rich?
[03:58:13.760 --> 03:58:14.760]  It sounds so crisp
[03:58:15.760 --> 03:58:16.760]  I said, you know what, it might sound crisp
[03:58:17.760 --> 03:58:18.760]  But if we don't make our nation rich again
[03:58:19.760 --> 03:58:20.760]  If we don't take back our jobs from all these other countries
[03:58:21.760 --> 03:58:22.760]  That are ripping us
[03:58:23.760 --> 03:58:24.760]  And if we don't take back our money
[03:58:25.760 --> 03:58:26.760]  And if we don't, you know, balance up our budget
[03:58:27.760 --> 03:58:28.760]  At least get it damn close and soon
[03:58:29.760 --> 03:58:30.760]  We're not gonna have a nation anymore
[03:58:31.760 --> 03:58:32.760]  We're a third world country, Donald Trump
[03:58:33.760 --> 03:58:34.760]  You know, I know you've got to go
[03:58:34.760 --> 03:58:36.760]  We're not gonna have a nation anymore
[03:58:37.760 --> 03:58:38.760]  We're not gonna have a nation anymore
