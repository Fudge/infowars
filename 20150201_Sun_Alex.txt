[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  we are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[00:11.680 --> 00:34.520]  network ladies and gentlemen the big news Whitney Houston's daughter found
[00:34.520 --> 00:39.320]  unresponsive in a tub and it's being reported by the Daily Mail it doesn't
[00:39.320 --> 00:45.000]  look good well the answer here is obviously to ban bathtubs because tens
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.040]  of thousands of people end up grounding in them just here in the
[00:48.040 --> 00:53.840]  United States every single year we need a five-day waiting period on taking
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.120]  baths immediately seriously I hope she gets better this shows how fame in many
[00:59.120 --> 01:03.560]  cases ends up destroying families not just the celebrities but their
[01:03.560 --> 01:08.000]  children as well that's why I've not really encouraged my children to get
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.960]  into thespian activities or music I mean I'm encouraged them to play music and
[01:12.960 --> 01:17.600]  learn instruments but it's just such destructive cultures where you got one
[01:17.600 --> 01:22.920]  half of groups out there or more than has like 99% of them trying to be
[01:22.920 --> 01:27.080]  successful trying to be famous and then feeling empty if they never become
[01:27.080 --> 01:32.880]  famous and then you've got those that do become famous statistically are some
[01:32.880 --> 01:37.800]  pretty unhappy people when you're talking about the whole entertainment front
[01:37.800 --> 01:42.360]  that's a well-known fact I don't have to belabor how nightmarishly unhappy a lot
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.400]  of the folks are out in LA that's why I haven't been to LA in about two years last
[01:47.400 --> 01:51.440]  time I was there it was for Jesse Ventura's 60th birthday it was a nice
[01:51.440 --> 01:54.960]  party met a lot of movie stars and people that came to the friends of Jesse but
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.160]  it just wasn't even worth going out there but he's my friend so I went I used
[01:59.160 --> 02:02.440]  to go out to Hollywood all the time had a lot of fun out there a lot of interesting
[02:02.440 --> 02:06.400]  people like to go out to the beach Malibu and stuff but it's just it's just
[02:06.400 --> 02:09.920]  that I wish the general public had seen what I've seen behind the scenes to
[02:09.920 --> 02:14.320]  realize there is no grass is greener money can get you better medical care
[02:14.320 --> 02:20.560]  let you see some interesting places get better food better service but that's
[02:20.560 --> 02:28.080]  it you don't like get transported to some heavenly Valhalla facility and then
[02:28.080 --> 02:35.080]  just everything's different people more and more think television and movies is
[02:35.080 --> 02:39.440]  where the real world is happening and they want to get into that world they
[02:39.440 --> 02:44.200]  want to be part of that but now the singularity of media is coming where
[02:44.200 --> 02:49.600]  basically everybody can quote be on TV and it's destroying the old dinosaur
[02:49.600 --> 02:54.720]  media but it's also to atomizing the audience for some of the folks that came
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.360]  along to the media the new media early like myself we're still growing most
[03:00.360 --> 03:06.040]  people can't swim upstream in the singularity as you had a few million
[03:06.040 --> 03:13.720]  web pages in 1993 you had I don't know 30 40 50 million pages by 96 the numbers
[03:13.720 --> 03:18.240]  vary and then now there's billions and billions and billions of individual
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.440]  web pages until it just becomes a singularity and there's cameras everywhere
[03:22.440 --> 03:26.360]  uploading in real time and the public votes by clicking on what they think is
[03:26.360 --> 03:33.680]  most interesting and pretty soon there's nothing the system can do to curtail
[03:33.680 --> 03:39.560]  or control that no matter how much algorithm censorship and manipulation
[03:39.560 --> 03:45.600]  they engage in they just can't control the narratives anymore okay big broadcast

[06:50.680 --> 06:54.960]  we asked all of these other major federal agencies faced here in DC for
[06:54.960 --> 07:00.480]  their micro purchase shopping lists and all refute I'm pledging to cut the
[07:00.480 --> 07:05.200]  deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office the
[07:05.200 --> 07:09.720]  independent congressional budget office warning a new fiscal crisis is coming if
[07:09.720 --> 07:13.240]  Washington doesn't get a spending in check raising the debt ceiling which has
[07:13.240 --> 07:18.040]  done been done over a hundred times does not increase our debt if you've got a
[07:18.040 --> 07:24.840]  business that you didn't build that somebody else made that happen
[07:24.840 --> 07:44.240]  life from the info wars.com studios first Ebola is not spread through the air
[07:44.240 --> 07:51.480]  like the flu Ebola is capable of entering human airway cells Ebola is
[07:51.480 --> 07:57.680]  primed to be able to have respiratory transmission crashing through the lies
[07:57.680 --> 08:04.880]  and disinformation it's Alex Jones you are either with the Republic or against

[08:24.560 --> 08:30.760]  info wars at nightly news 7 o'clock central every weeknight at prison
[08:30.760 --> 08:37.640]  planet TV all right I'm going to reveal to you here today the winner of Superbowl
[08:37.640 --> 08:47.160]  49 that kicks off in about 22 minutes from now I will reveal to you today the
[08:47.160 --> 08:57.720]  winner early then we're going to break down several videos that are everything
[08:57.720 --> 09:03.760]  the police need to be against if they don't want to be turned into this
[09:03.760 --> 09:07.880]  globalist dehumanization force that the social engineers hope they will be
[09:07.880 --> 09:14.840]  because they want to destroy the police just as they've destroyed the press when
[09:14.840 --> 09:18.840]  they're done with them see they bought off the mainstream media uses propaganda
[09:18.840 --> 09:22.960]  France it lost its audience now there's coming out with federal and state-run
[09:22.960 --> 09:28.680]  media that puts the propaganda directly out you destroyed your own profession if
[09:28.680 --> 09:32.840]  they can continue the militarization of the police they can continue trying to
[09:32.840 --> 09:37.000]  turn them against the American people and vice versa then they can create the
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.200]  social destabilization that will allow a centralization over the police but down
[09:43.200 --> 09:47.880]  the road they will then be scapegoated and destroyed and it will be basically
[09:47.880 --> 09:53.760]  autonomous ground air and sea robots and surveillance systems that will control
[09:53.760 --> 10:01.720]  the public an example is if you get a new Chevy Tahoe it's got the sensors in
[10:01.720 --> 10:07.040]  the seats that every time you get near the line they buzz and click and
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.480]  condition you and then of course report back with the data systems they have on
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.240]  board to the government to the threat fusion centers everywhere you're going
[10:16.240 --> 10:20.360]  what you're doing and your quote true driving record you can argue well that
[10:20.360 --> 10:26.840]  will make us safer no it's it's it's AI systems of control you don't quote pay
[10:26.840 --> 10:30.040]  whatever the IRS wants you can't leave the country you can't get through
[10:30.040 --> 10:34.920]  regional checkpoints you can't buy or sell you may have heard about that in the
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.240]  Bible but let's just cut the Bible out of it for those out there that don't
[10:38.240 --> 10:43.520]  believe in that just look at what you could do with not being able to buy or
[10:43.520 --> 10:48.800]  sell unless your biometric retina scan or thumb print checks out you're not
[10:48.800 --> 10:52.160]  going to need police in the future ladies and gentlemen they're gonna have
[10:52.160 --> 11:01.960]  pre-programmed smaller squads of humans that have been pre-selected to be maybe
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.120]  10% of the overall enforcement system humans are to be scaled back in just the
[11:07.120 --> 11:15.520]  next 15 years or so to a fraction of the force that the system has and on top of
[11:15.520 --> 11:21.360]  that through compartmentalization and
[11:21.680 --> 11:27.200]  computers surveilling the police and military robots surveilling them by
[11:27.200 --> 11:32.320]  robots robot in their heads-up display robots in their smart devices these are
[11:32.320 --> 11:37.160]  all robots these are all AI robots integrated into the master web they are
[11:37.160 --> 11:40.520]  to be surveilled and basically given orders and directives down to the
[11:40.520 --> 11:45.680]  finest detail so that they themselves begin to become true biological
[11:45.680 --> 11:53.280]  androids by interfacing with the second by second neural commands that are being
[11:53.280 --> 11:58.520]  given to them in the brain interfaces the heads-up brain interfaces and then
[11:58.520 --> 12:07.040]  finally of course ported interfaces wireless ported chip interfaces so it's
[12:07.040 --> 12:10.080]  not just that the machines are going to surveil us and control us we're going to
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.720]  merge with them and you'll be able to get unlimited pleasure merging with them
[12:15.720 --> 12:19.880]  you'll be able to get unlimited life you'll be told you'll be able to be given
[12:19.880 --> 12:27.920]  massive knowledge and language you'll be able to learn things much faster but
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.280]  just like calculators made it where people can't do basic math now just like
[12:32.280 --> 12:35.840]  smartphones they have the whole world's knowledge at your fingertips basically
[12:35.840 --> 12:40.560]  to a great extent but people are getting dumber they're getting less human their
[12:40.560 --> 12:45.320]  IQs are dropping their neurons are dying their their brains are wiring wrong
[12:45.320 --> 12:48.840]  I mean this is in all the major studies all of them just type in smartphones
[12:48.840 --> 12:54.720]  lowering IQ smartphones rewiring brains smartphones television watching
[12:54.720 --> 12:59.760]  connected to Alzheimer's neurological disorders and it's not just because the
[12:59.760 --> 13:04.280]  devices inherently don't let humans do things for ourselves anymore that's part
[13:04.280 --> 13:12.040]  of it like someone traveling to Mars on a one-year mission ends up losing half
[13:12.040 --> 13:19.520]  their muscle mass roughly is estimated just as that degenerates you this is
[13:19.520 --> 13:25.400]  degenerating the general population but it's being done because they're pouring
[13:25.400 --> 13:31.280]  all their menace and hatred and all their dehumanizing technologies into this to
[13:31.280 --> 13:37.960]  focus and lens that basic effect to make it much much worse so we're seeing the
[13:37.960 --> 13:42.880]  beginning of the end of humanity as we know it now let me announce the winner
[13:42.880 --> 13:51.480]  of Super Bowl 49 for you and then we will get into New York cop pulls gun on
[13:51.480 --> 13:58.440]  teens having snowball snowball fight and you really can't make this up I've
[13:58.440 --> 14:03.160]  seen these videos before this seems to come out every year all over the country
[14:03.160 --> 14:08.080]  where it's snowing that if people are snowball fighting each other the police
[14:08.080 --> 14:12.840]  come and point guns at them this is not the first time and this is all part of
[14:12.840 --> 14:16.200]  the mass mental illness should we hate the police in general because of this
[14:16.200 --> 14:19.960]  no we're meant to hate them with these type of things coming out and being
[14:19.960 --> 14:22.920]  looked at we need to understand though this is part of the general mental
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.040]  illness where your neighbor calls the police on you because you're spat your
[14:27.040 --> 14:30.840]  five-year-old on their butt when they go out the street or your 10-year-olds
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.600]  playing across the street at the park so they call the cops on you it's mentally
[14:34.600 --> 14:41.080]  ill politically correct people that are in the society and it's the globalist
[14:41.080 --> 14:48.480]  directives and the police forces and the type of people they're picking I mean as
[14:48.480 --> 14:51.520]  corrupt as the police I grew up around where they probably join you in a
[14:51.520 --> 14:58.000]  snowball fight this is mental illness the cop pointing guns at teens for
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.880]  snowball fights we're going to be getting to all of that because it's
[15:01.880 --> 15:05.520]  it's salt folks to be in a consensual snowball fight
[15:05.520 --> 15:09.880]  funny I thought when I played snowball fights in Dallas with my dad and
[15:09.880 --> 15:13.880]  friends and stuff I thought it was fun cops taser family man again and again
[15:13.880 --> 15:21.040]  27 times until he went limp and died and then of course he's basically already
[15:21.040 --> 15:25.200]  pretty much dying so they stick him in a hundred plus degree vehicle and he dies
[15:25.200 --> 15:31.800]  and it's being defended of course that's out of Victorville California we're
[15:31.800 --> 15:39.320]  gonna look at that coming up we're going to look at the new beheading of the
[15:39.320 --> 15:43.320]  Japanese citizen a White House seeks to limit health law tax troubles wait till

[21:18.400 --> 21:22.440]  democratic party donor the way i read this new york times article you may not
[21:22.440 --> 21:28.320]  have to pay the obama penalty to keep kicking the can down the road they'll
[21:28.320 --> 21:31.960]  give and then of course it's like obama care itself people go log on to the
[21:31.960 --> 21:35.400]  website with a million trying to find the free health care it isn't there
[21:35.400 --> 21:42.840]  suckers that's why the insurance company profits are up forty seven percent in
[21:42.840 --> 21:50.560]  just one year 2014 and it's set to go up even more this year because they care
[21:50.560 --> 21:59.440]  about you at davos they're liberal george soros and others but first let
[21:59.440 --> 22:05.760]  me engage in my satirical analysis of super bowl forty nine between the seattle
[22:05.760 --> 22:10.720]  seahawks and the new england patriots but the grocery store today was a total
[22:10.720 --> 22:13.600]  madhouse people grabbing all their goodies and there's nothing wrong with
[22:13.600 --> 22:19.240]  watching a game i'll be clear in my view that's case but men on average learn
[22:19.240 --> 22:25.520]  every angle they play all this fantasy football they know the scores going back
[22:25.520 --> 22:30.520]  decades they know what kind of car the quarterback drives this is all been
[22:30.520 --> 22:34.880]  designed and deployed you know because they know humans like games competitive
[22:34.880 --> 22:39.640]  games because they're simulated warfare i mean play tug-of-war with your dog in
[22:39.640 --> 22:43.360]  the backyard that's a game it's simulated fighting over a piece of meat
[22:43.360 --> 22:49.120]  games are things that are simulations of real things we do that aren't as
[22:49.120 --> 22:54.000]  dangerous like a lot of guys just want to threaten you in the hallway of a
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.920]  business or at the shopping mall or on the street at night they don't actually
[22:57.920 --> 23:02.760]  want to cash the checks their mouths are writing it's it's a simulated tough guy
[23:02.760 --> 23:08.520]  stuff and it's the same thing with watching sports your son or daughter's
[23:08.520 --> 23:12.400]  playing great if you want to learn to be a competitive cyclist or NFL football
[23:12.400 --> 23:17.000]  player wonderful i'm just sick of all the arrogant players of the arrogant
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.320]  owners all the corruption people acting like it's the greatest thing in the
[23:21.320 --> 23:30.280]  world to be Roger Stallback or to be Tom Landry or to be LeBron James in the
[23:30.280 --> 23:36.320]  more modern situation and then I see this the establishment using all the
[23:36.320 --> 23:40.640]  different spokesmen that the Terry Bradshaw's to push shingles and flu
[23:40.640 --> 23:44.600]  shots and you know anti-gun commercials by another you know famous
[23:44.600 --> 23:49.720]  football player i'm just sick of it i mean i'm sick of Michelle Obama in the
[23:49.720 --> 23:56.120]  news you're thanking Hollywood for for for promoting same-sex marriage and the
[23:56.120 --> 24:01.320]  point is what's the issue here of being force-fed these things constantly i'm
[24:01.320 --> 24:06.320]  not against gay people but i'm sure sick of the radical agenda that controls it
[24:06.320 --> 24:11.240]  pushing an anti-heterosexual agenda an anti-family agenda and just every other
[24:11.240 --> 24:15.360]  cartoon or movie can't let my kids watch mainstream television because it's
[24:15.360 --> 24:22.160]  just it's just messages trying to sexualize my children you perverts gay
[24:22.160 --> 24:26.320]  rights doesn't mean pedophilia is legalized doesn't mean you could teach
[24:26.320 --> 24:29.520]  five-year-olds how to masturbate like Jocelyn elders wanted to do when she was
[24:29.520 --> 24:33.840]  surgeon general member reach down and help them that creepy old woman's voice
[24:33.840 --> 24:37.840]  these are a bunch of freaks what are you doing talking about five-year-olds
[24:37.840 --> 24:43.840]  members they are a bunch of control freaks that want to get up on television
[24:43.840 --> 24:48.800]  like cnbc does or msnbc and say your kids belong to the state i'm not gonna
[24:48.800 --> 24:52.920]  play that clip again they said it in their promo you know what i played it
[24:52.920 --> 24:55.640]  probably a hundred times i've played probably 200 times the clip them saying
[24:55.640 --> 24:59.320]  and cbs news mercury's good for your child's brain don't listen to conspiracy
[24:59.320 --> 25:03.760]  theorist i mean bbc came out last week said yeah companies are making people
[25:03.760 --> 25:09.760]  take microchips to work and we played the news clip so let me tell you who the
[25:09.760 --> 25:16.120]  winner of Super Bowl 49 is it's not the football teams it's the social
[25:16.120 --> 25:22.280]  engineers because while we sleep well we watch simulated football games and when
[25:22.280 --> 25:26.080]  we watch the beautiful reporters and the cheerleaders and the big pageant and
[25:26.080 --> 25:29.880]  every time they score a touchdown in the Pavlovian conditioning they cut to the
[25:29.880 --> 25:33.000]  troops not to help the troops of the veterans while they put them on secret
[25:33.000 --> 25:40.560]  death list no no no just to just to say the NFL is the troops and associate
[25:40.560 --> 25:44.280]  getting in uniform with a touchdown like they ding the bell the dog gets
[25:44.280 --> 25:49.000]  steak do that 30 40 times ding the bell the dogs mouth starts salivating you
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.440]  want to be animals you don't want to have your free will you want to be
[25:51.440 --> 25:56.520]  totally programmed to condition hey that's your issue but then don't vote to
[25:56.520 --> 26:00.160]  take my rights don't vote to take my private property and the right to self
[26:00.160 --> 26:09.520]  defense so the winner of Super Bowl 49 are the parasites and while they break
[26:09.520 --> 26:12.920]  the law while they take our rights while they enslave us while they study how
[26:12.920 --> 26:16.360]  humans work and then use that knowledge against us they sit there teaching us
[26:16.360 --> 26:20.040]  from birth to death never to look behind the curtain never look behind the
[26:20.040 --> 26:23.840]  mirror never look at who's in the control room never try to come out of the
[26:23.840 --> 26:30.840]  cave and discover the wider universe around you never never never just gain
[26:30.840 --> 26:35.760]  your own temporal power by joining the system I mean the knowledge I have of
[26:35.760 --> 26:41.400]  how things work I could just dominate business and life and corporate stuff

[28:24.040 --> 28:27.120]  hormone therapy because I knew that it would cause cell division and kill you
[28:27.120 --> 28:29.720]  but when you get older you've had a bunch of vaccines I'm not a doctor I'm

[33:24.200 --> 33:29.920]  I want to say put on these glasses or start cuing concrete
[33:32.920 --> 33:40.480]  they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders they have recruited the rich
[33:40.480 --> 33:46.040]  and the powerful and they have blinded us to the truth the question is do we all
[33:46.040 --> 33:50.200]  work for central bankers that's what I want to address to our guests tonight
[33:50.200 --> 33:56.560]  our impulses are being redirected we are living in an artificially induced state
[33:56.560 --> 34:02.080]  of consciousness that resembles sleep an estimated 50 to 70 million Americans

[34:34.840 --> 34:42.480]  substantial both for ourselves and for you the human power elite
[34:42.480 --> 34:53.360]  and for the first time in all of human history mankind is politically
[34:53.360 --> 35:00.480]  awakened that's a total new reality I've got one that can see we can't be the
[35:00.480 --> 35:05.280]  only ones who can see unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices that
[35:05.280 --> 35:09.800]  incessantly warn of government is nothing more than some separate sinister

[35:22.200 --> 35:28.960]  optimistic as to what the comes of it all it really boils down to our ability
[35:28.960 --> 35:41.920]  to accept we don't need pessimism I have two words for you predator drones
[35:41.920 --> 35:47.080]  you will never see it coming don't predict the first guy who uses a second
[35:47.080 --> 35:51.080]  amendment weapon to bring a drone down this been hovering over his house is
[35:51.080 --> 35:58.920]  going to be a folk hero and there is a single broadcast every second of every
[35:58.920 --> 36:03.240]  day through our television sense I'm just trying to warn you folks the
[36:03.240 --> 36:09.520]  television is a giant LED weapon system it's so advanced they got a monkey
[36:09.520 --> 36:13.640]  farm in Bastrop folks that he also would suit testing on great apes Reese's
[36:13.640 --> 36:16.600]  monkeys the whole nine yards and they go oh you didn't see this and punch a
[36:16.600 --> 36:19.840]  button into beating hundreds of monkeys wires in their brains with television
[36:19.840 --> 36:30.960]  sets brainwashing them you can have a little taste that good life too I know
[36:30.960 --> 36:37.960]  you want it hell everybody does do it to your own kind what's the threat we all
[36:37.960 --> 36:42.680]  sell out every day much will be on the winning team the real men of the world
[36:42.680 --> 36:49.840]  have to stand up and say I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass
[36:49.840 --> 36:57.320]  and I'm all out of bubblegum time to take a stand boys you know you got a
[36:57.320 --> 37:01.320]  little courage stand up for yourself
[37:01.320 --> 37:07.960]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front
[37:07.960 --> 37:14.280]  lines of the info war the after winners give a press conference and how to buy
[37:14.280 --> 37:28.040]  a sailboat that's a long four five-minute intro I don't normally air those very
[37:28.040 --> 37:32.520]  often but it's extremely powerful and it dovetails with what's happening in the
[37:32.520 --> 37:37.800]  real world the allegory that they break down of they live basically matched up
[37:37.800 --> 37:41.920]  with what's really happening in the real world today if you're a radio listener
[37:41.920 --> 37:46.720]  you can always on your iPhone or droid or computer watch the free video feed
[37:46.720 --> 37:53.040]  for the radio shows TV shows at info wars dot com forward slash show here's
[37:53.040 --> 38:01.680]  what I want to do I want to open the phones up specifically on things that
[38:01.680 --> 38:09.840]  misdirect us things that are designed to captivate our attention so they can
[38:09.840 --> 38:14.160]  have advertising and there's nothing wrong with that but then the other
[38:14.160 --> 38:21.040]  agenda that is much larger than just getting us to stay and watch it is that
[38:21.040 --> 38:26.840]  they take normal natural instinctive impulses of men to want to watch other
[38:26.840 --> 38:32.400]  men in war against each other and just have strategy that's what chess is but
[38:32.400 --> 38:36.280]  if you play chess your brain gets better if you watch football you don't get
[38:36.280 --> 38:40.760]  smarter you don't make more money you're sitting on your butt just being a
[38:40.760 --> 38:47.680]  spectator you're not living and I don't hate football it's just the religion of
[38:47.680 --> 38:52.040]  this country and you notice where our country is going men won't go and fight
[38:52.040 --> 38:58.760]  at the PTA to stop all the brainwashing and anti-family anti-gun
[38:58.760 --> 39:04.280]  pro-abortion garbage going on but they'll go down to the bar and get in a
[39:04.280 --> 39:08.520]  fight with somebody that talks about about their team so they're misdirecting
[39:08.520 --> 39:14.760]  our impulses I want to hear from you on football on sports in general and on
[39:14.760 --> 39:21.920]  other distractions the tabloids the people getting into you know following
[39:21.920 --> 39:30.080]  the lives of Whitney Houston or you know any of these people Whitney Houston's
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.560]  daughter found unresponsive and tub it doesn't look good they don't know if she'll
[39:33.560 --> 39:38.120]  live we hope she is better but while we're busy watching somebody else's lives
[39:38.120 --> 39:43.560]  we don't develop our own and that's what the social engineers want dumb down
[39:43.560 --> 39:49.760]  people that are experts on football experts on I always forget her name who
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.920]  did Hannah Montana turn into Miley Cyrus that was all planned to get everybody
[39:53.920 --> 39:57.640]  watching and then try to corrupt the young girls because if you're corrupt
[39:57.640 --> 40:01.920]  and not focused on other more honorable things you never get fully fulfilled
[40:01.920 --> 40:05.840]  never become honorable they know honorable people will stand in the way
[40:05.840 --> 40:13.920]  of a takeover so I want to hear from you on this subject but also on this really
[40:13.920 --> 40:19.600]  big one some doctors won't see patients with anti-vaccine views now this has
[40:19.600 --> 40:24.880]  been going on for a while but now the drumbeat is all over the news print
[40:24.880 --> 40:31.360]  radio TV we all hear it why there's measles outbreaks at Disney because you
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.640]  didn't take the vaccine the measles mumps rebella why there's people are
[40:35.640 --> 40:38.720]  getting it and I read these articles about kids dying from flu and stuff and
[40:38.720 --> 40:42.240]  the parents are always like I got my daughter shot and she died a week later
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.720]  you people didn't take the flu you killed her well a they admit the flu shot
[40:47.720 --> 40:52.080]  never has never will protect you they never quote guess the right mutation
[40:52.080 --> 40:56.120]  they admit this year zero lowers your immune system and the people dying it's
[40:56.120 --> 40:59.240]  always in the article they'd been vaccinated usually I believe the
[40:59.240 --> 41:02.960]  vaccine in many cases it's killing them we know vaccines kill people you know
[41:02.960 --> 41:07.400]  they call it an adverse reaction death read the insert geon beret the list goes
[41:07.400 --> 41:11.680]  on and on but there's this new thing beat you over the head I'm not gonna see
[41:11.680 --> 41:15.680]  you and now trying to say I might let you in the hospital there's no law but
[41:15.680 --> 41:19.200]  we're not going to treat that gunshot wound or that car wreck or that bee
[41:19.200 --> 41:24.400]  stings because you're making us not safe because you didn't put what we said
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.240]  in your body they want to put hundreds of vaccines government goes in lobbies
[41:28.240 --> 41:31.160]  to get it on the recommended list by the health department through the federal
[41:31.160 --> 41:34.440]  and state governments and then they're there saying your child needs three
[41:34.440 --> 41:37.720]  different forms of hepatitis shot when they're born a very dangerous vaccine
[41:37.720 --> 41:43.360]  they admit when it's worthless if your child isn't having unprotected sex when
[41:43.360 --> 41:47.680]  they're newborn or enter using intervening as drugs I mean there's zero
[41:47.680 --> 41:53.920]  zero and then all the UN programs where they catch them spiking the vaccines to
[41:53.920 --> 41:58.680]  sterilize you name and I mean you'd be crazy to take it meanwhile they now
[41:58.680 --> 42:03.240]  admit in Reuters that the California measles outbreak likely imported to the
[42:03.240 --> 42:06.760]  United States with all the giant hordes of illegals coming in well yeah that's
[42:06.760 --> 42:12.400]  true but see let's not discuss that let's blame the unvaccinated my children
[42:12.400 --> 42:15.680]  all got the measles they never had a single vaccine they would just get a
[42:15.680 --> 42:21.880]  few little spots on them and they were fine whoop-de-doo it's not that I don't
[42:21.880 --> 42:25.440]  believe in vaccine technology either I know it can be useful it's that you
[42:25.440 --> 42:29.560]  can't trust these companies these systems they've been given immunity here's

[51:38.360 --> 51:43.400]  thank you for calling what do you make of sports do you agree with me that it's
[51:43.400 --> 51:47.560]  sucking our manhoods sucking our soul sucking our time what you do in your
[51:47.560 --> 51:52.400]  life I watched a bunch of arrogant roid heads I'm really manly or you
[51:52.400 --> 51:56.480]  disagree with me. Well yeah sports is definitely bread and circus but
[51:56.480 --> 52:01.240]  interestingly Fritz Sprigmeyer said in a recent interview that NFL and also NHL
[52:01.240 --> 52:04.560]  players and coaches are under trauma-based mind control and he's not a
[52:04.560 --> 52:08.440]  conspiracy theory he takes facts very seriously and I actually sent Brian
[52:08.440 --> 52:11.720]  Toey an email to tell him this and Brian didn't respond even though he usually
[52:11.720 --> 52:15.320]  does respond to all his emails he says that on his website now that I don't know
[52:15.320 --> 52:18.360]  what to make of that but it's pretty creepy that he's the guy that wrote the
[52:18.360 --> 52:22.400]  fixes in you know undoubtedly you want to call trauma-based mind control call
[52:22.400 --> 52:26.240]  people watching television eight hours a day are under mind control it's designed
[52:26.240 --> 52:31.800]  to mind control you it's a sick fake synthetic dead culture it's mind control
[52:31.800 --> 52:36.080]  through the whole sports program the pressure the brainwashing the payoffs
[52:36.080 --> 52:41.160]  when they're at the college level the cover-ups they're already under a
[52:41.160 --> 52:46.560]  cultural narcissistic delusional mind control I don't know if you can say
[52:46.560 --> 52:54.240]  that the actual players themselves are under a CIA program but it's very
[52:54.240 --> 52:59.240]  interesting yeah and it can be used to make them the coaches call stupid plays
[52:59.240 --> 53:02.320]  and have the players fumble the ball against their will for it spying by our
[53:02.320 --> 53:08.280]  well listen Andrew this is how they do it they say we gave you a hundred
[53:08.280 --> 53:14.640]  thousand dollars when you were a junior at this school and now you you're going
[53:14.640 --> 53:21.320]  to fumble at this particular point in the game I mean that's the mind control
[53:21.320 --> 53:28.120]  we're going to release pictures of you with your gay boyfriends when you were
[53:28.120 --> 53:31.680]  out in quote Reno or whatever hypothetically if you don't do what we
[53:31.680 --> 53:37.880]  tell you that's the mind control that's going on it's not all just the CIA
[53:37.880 --> 53:41.680]  putting a bag over your head and keeping you for six months at a hospital and
[53:41.680 --> 53:45.120]  playing audio tapes to you while you're on a bunch of different drugs to wax you
[53:45.120 --> 53:48.200]  out of your mind to convince you you're a new person and they take that new
[53:48.200 --> 53:52.200]  person and train him to be an assassin that's been declassified that's on
[53:52.200 --> 53:57.520]  history channel they took tens of thousands of us foster children flew
[53:57.520 --> 54:05.040]  him to Canada under Dr. Ewing Cameron and his protege Dr. Jolly and West who
[54:05.040 --> 54:09.680]  became McVay's psychiatrist during his time before he was supposedly executed
[54:09.680 --> 54:12.680]  that you can't make up and people don't even care it's like oh big deal
[54:12.680 --> 54:16.080]  several about speculation I mean anything fritz a good guy I can't speak for
[54:16.080 --> 54:19.680]  him but I don't want to say like all the coaches and people are under classic
[54:19.680 --> 54:25.720]  mind control let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Missouri once talk about
[54:25.720 --> 54:30.360]  self-driving cars yeah England announced it oh there are boxes in the cars we
[54:30.360 --> 54:34.080]  accidentally put there and we're going to remote control your cars now just like
[54:34.080 --> 54:39.160]  your smart meters go ahead yeah I'm a good friend of friends we talk over the
[54:39.160 --> 54:43.280]  phone oh you know off and on about things like these and one thing I really
[54:43.280 --> 54:47.560]  thought was interesting is that you and we and and David Knight's been talking
[54:47.560 --> 54:53.120]  about the cars and I got an observation there's these weird intersections it's
[54:53.120 --> 54:57.320]  all over there's at least three in Kansas City I don't know about Texas but
[54:57.320 --> 55:01.200]  these strange intersections where you don't actually cross over like you
[55:01.200 --> 55:06.440]  normally would and what I'm thinking is if they got to cut out all the variables
[55:06.440 --> 55:12.000]  so it's like a it's like a one and a zero it's the on or off this forward
[55:12.000 --> 55:18.880]  listen listen here's how it works the computers are already in control of all
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.360]  the new fancy cars I'm just boiling it down I could take 10 hours to review this
[55:23.360 --> 55:27.000]  but I've looked into it when we told people about it 20 years ago it's now
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.960]  here if you're driving a new Audi or a new Toyota or something like that you're
[55:32.960 --> 55:37.040]  noticing now that the seats when you cross the line buzz you notice it gives
[55:37.040 --> 55:42.200]  you alarms you notice that quote you slips of the car took control they're
[55:42.200 --> 55:45.920]  calling me of these crash avoidance systems but and again the road to hell
[55:45.920 --> 55:50.480]  is paved with good good intentions on the surface but yes already the cars are
[55:50.480 --> 55:54.480]  driving themselves they're saying that pilots don't know how to fly anymore
[55:54.480 --> 55:58.440]  because everything's autopilot basically and that's what's causing mistakes when
[55:58.440 --> 56:03.520]  the autopilot fails pilots will soon just be like a toilet attendant there'll
[56:03.520 --> 56:08.080]  be a vestigial person to come back and talk to the people and you know tell
[56:08.080 --> 56:12.640]  them about drink specials on the aircraft and you'll tell your kids yeah
[56:12.640 --> 56:15.920]  used to the pilots actually flew the plane so we're not building a world
[56:15.920 --> 56:20.840]  that humans command and that make humans better and that machines aid we're
[56:20.840 --> 56:24.940]  building a world where everything is tax traced to controlled I mean the
[56:24.940 --> 56:28.360]  British government came out last week so huge for those that didn't see our
[56:28.360 --> 56:31.400]  article about it link right to the British government said yeah during peak
[56:31.400 --> 56:35.160]  traffic times will take control your car control your speed and and then it
[56:35.160 --> 56:41.320]  puts you in the lines it's all GPS down and then it's it's it's got
[56:41.320 --> 56:44.960]  proximity detectors the whole deal they're just doing it they're not asking
[56:44.960 --> 56:48.000]  the NSA is spying without warrants they're not asking they're doing it
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.600]  they're putting garbage in the vaccines they're not asking they're just doing it

[56:59.800 --> 57:03.880]  under UN control with the Pacific trade deals they're not asking they're just
[57:03.880 --> 57:12.240]  doing it unless we realize the takeover is happening it's a takeover by stealth
[57:12.240 --> 57:15.040]  just like the North American Union documents came out and they said it's
[57:15.040 --> 57:19.120]  integration by stealth it's takeover by stealth well we're here breaking the
[57:19.120 --> 57:26.880]  stealth mode we're here making the enemy uncloak we are here exposing the
[57:26.880 --> 57:32.360]  globalist at point blank range no compromise so that there was a testament

[57:36.960 --> 57:41.240]  trance somebody wasn't a zombie somebody wanted a world built for humanity

[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.800]  year how you doing Alex I'm going pretty good brother I just wanted to point out
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.280]  a couple things real quick first of all wanted it I wanted to make clear that the
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.920]  only central thing Christians have is the God's word this isn't about anything
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:19.040]  on the TV necessarily but we have God's word as our center guidance the NIV the
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.160]  new national version is the highest selling according to the CBA in the
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:29.200]  ECPA in this country and it amidst 16 verses from the King James version which
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:33.400]  which the KJV is the closest we have right now that English speaking people
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:39.920]  read it amidst 16 verses which the Bible clearly tells anyone who takes out or
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.920]  puts in he'll get the plagues that are mentioned in this book and revelations
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.040]  and you know what the plagues are but yeah your children hate you your society
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.520]  breaks down you'll be invaded you'll be enslaved you'll be taken over you'll be
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.720]  homeless it's everything that's happening it's what we're getting right
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.240]  now and the terrorist attacks in 9-11 was a breach in our security it was a
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.080]  wake-up call we're not waking up there's no need to fight it it's a course that
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.560]  was predetermined but anyway new age Luciferians call Satan the capstone
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.640]  that's why the dollar bill has a all-seeing eye above the pyramid that's
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:19.640]  all satanic and in Matthew and the King James version Jesus talks about a a
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:25.640]  stone or Jesus talks about a stone that the builders rejected it was the
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.320]  cornerstone and it became actually the foundation of a building and that was
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.240]  through Lord you know that was through our God's doing that was Jesus was the
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.640]  cornerstone the 1984 edition of the new international version which is still
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.560]  widely no that's right Christ is the real cornerstone or the capstone so
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:46.000]  everything the devil creates is a false counterfeit but he's not a Christ is not
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.920]  the capstone he's a cornerstone he's the cornerstone and the difference is the
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:56.160]  devil is the capstone that's the difference now I understand on the
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.720]  pyramid the capstone but I'm saying at the same time God is on top so you can
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.000]  say the all-seeing eye is the eye of God if you believe that the Luciferians
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.120]  expropriate every sacred symbol for themselves but I agree with the verse
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:17.280]  you're quoting it's pretty heavy stuff it is and one more thing I want your
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.480]  listeners to actually study the Quran I want you to look at how it was released
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.200]  the Quran is published not in chronological order it's published in the
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.160]  largest book to the smallest the last book that Muhammad received was the
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.080]  tenth surah if you go right before that the ninth surah is the surah that has
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:40.400]  the violence in it those were Allah's final words these were his final
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:47.640]  messages it's the capstone I'm sorry you're saying it's the capstone no I'm
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.840]  saying that you're saying the Quran is published like a pyramid the first
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:58.080]  book's big I mean it builds towards the small at the top it it it builds to the
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.040]  spot it confuses readers because they think it's chronological and it's not
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.360]  the last book given to Muhammad the one of the last ones was the ninth surah
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.600]  that's what he left Muhammad personally beheaded six to 900 people himself this
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.840]  was a this was a common thing for them and right now Islam's in the Middle
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.240]  East are asking Islam's in America why they're freaking out about beheading
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.360]  they're saying don't you remember but that Muhammad personally beheaded six to
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:28.280]  900 people himself in my opinion this is Islam the only people that are
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.880]  perverting Islam are the ones that are working here in the states that are
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.520]  being well listen no I hear you I think to be politically correct we should have
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.240]  a day where children are beheaded at school to prove that we're open to
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:45.240]  different cultures how does that sound if you want to back up this long that's
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.480]  what you've got to do if you want to real law you've got to be head those that
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:54.040]  are that are our blasphemies well I think you're being racist and I think that
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.920]  Obama should behead children on the White House lawn to prove he's not racist
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.560]  year after year we watched the threats steadily increase and now this winner has
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.000]  been the worst on record when it comes to our immune systems and health for more
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.160]  than two years info wars life dot com has been watching this crisis intensify

[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.240]  that's in the classy newspaper all of this and more coming up in the hour of
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:26.600]  broadcast we have left here on Super Bowl 49 he dared to speak of other issues
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:34.760]  during the Super Bowl showing what a cowardly traitor he was but if you want
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.640]  to see the satirical video I did it's up on info wars dot com and prison

[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:52.560]  really won the game that's going live right now the people that one of the

[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:12.200]  children and dinners getting cooked right now and we're gonna hang out and
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:18.880]  tell jokes as I like talking to people now when my kids are on swim team or
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.520]  they're in some other sporting event I go see them play and that's where
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:34.480]  that's great and a fun thing to do but I just can't believe people just get so
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.360]  excited and talk about us the greatest thing in the world all the hype and it's
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:44.960]  totally empty how about a investigation into why cancer is up several thousand
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:48.400]  percent in this country I mean we know why it's on purpose how about an
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.920]  investigation into neurological disorders off the chart how about an
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:56.120]  investigation into what's really going on oh no that's not what you do now I
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.800]  want to go to Q in New York here in a moment Q called in her being mentioned
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:05.000]  this the last hour we have the video for folks that are watching us on
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  prisonplanet.tv or info wars dot com four slash show on the free feeds and I've
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.960]  seen these type of things happen before with police arresting or pulling guns
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:21.840]  on folks throwing snowballs not at cars I think I actually did that a few times
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.920]  one of the few delinquent type things I did New York where it was neighbors
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.400]  people I knew so actually kind of wasn't had the permission I mean they knew I was
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.360]  like I'm gonna get you I'm gonna get you when you drive off so I guess I wasn't
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:37.680]  a delinquent kind of wish I was though New York cop pulls gun on teens having
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.880]  snowball fight the stories from a PNAC it's up on info wars dot com fearing for
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:46.440]  his life a New York cop pulled a gun on a group of teens having a snowball fight
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:51.640]  don't bleeping move guys have we bleeped this yet so we can play it yeah it's
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:57.000]  bleep okay it's bleeped okay the new Rochelle police officer can be heard on
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.640]  the video as he points his gun at youths who are down on their knees with their
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.400]  hands in the air the cop proceeds to pat each of the youths down with one hand
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.280]  will hold the gun continually telling them not to move we saw the video up in
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:14.000]  New York of last week where they pull the guys over and shoot them I don't play
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.680]  these videos like to get a point in against the cops and oh let's get the
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.640]  cops and they're a bunch of scum we don't need cowards who were so scared to
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.640]  death they pull guns on people for petty reasons end up shooting innocent people
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.720]  that's going to start a civil war in this country
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:38.960]  we don't need the nanny state police out there that taser a father with no
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:45.000]  criminal record 27 times until he went limp and died I'm gonna play I've got
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.200]  video of that they put him in a hot car after they done it he dropped his kids
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.760]  off went for a bike ride four o'clock the afternoon he they thought he might be a
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.960]  suspect they just start tasering him and they kill him and the interest well he
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.880]  just to set us and he's dead no these tasers make people have heart attacks
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:05.760]  they're being overused it's injustice it's wrong we all know it it needs to stop
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.880]  and when cops do the wrong things they need to get in trouble so there's then
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:15.600]  respect for good police and they end up becoming the dominant force out there not
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.840]  the thugs who are protected you know who's targeted down most major
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.720]  departments it's people that try to follow the Constitution it's people who
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.200]  try to be public servants and not just revenue generators it's a very dangerous
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:31.080]  trend so let's play the clip of the snowball situation I'll give you a
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:36.040]  play-by-play of your radio listener and narrate it here it is
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:52.640]  I just don't have to move because they are snowball
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:13:00.440]  this group of guys was having a snowball fight and now the cop has a gun on
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:12.360]  them this is the breakdown of society and I get black people wanting to say
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.400]  don't shoot it's not illegal to be black and I get there's some profile and
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.560]  things that are wrong and happen out there but then George Soros funds 33
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.280]  million to fund these groups to then go out and chant kill the cops throw them
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.560]  all off cocktails that it creates a society where everybody's killing each
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.560]  other why does the system want that because then you're not worried about
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.280]  Obamacare raising a bunch of taxes on you and doubling your your prices for
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.600]  health care because you're busy hating white people hating cops hating black
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:45.600]  people it's divide and conquer it's very elementary it's very simple very easy to
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:52.200]  understand but can we become smart enough to deal with it and pull back from
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.600]  what's happening get the cops to de-escalate get the public to de-escalate
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:59.080]  and then to have a discussion about do we want to be a free country is it good
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.120]  to be a free country it's a good to have due process and private property the
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:07.040]  answers yes and we're about to lose all that let's go to Q in New York you say
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.520]  you live in the neighborhood there in New Rochelle what are you hearing what's
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:16.200]  your take on this you called in about it yeah how you doing Alex yeah this is
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.080]  Q in there so yeah um well I agree with you it is a breakdown of society and
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.520]  versus you know it's a breakdown of my neighborhood in New Rochelle traditionally
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:29.920]  it's always been a place where we had community police and I'm born and raised
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.480]  in New Rochelle and you know because like a lot of the cops who own the police
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.520]  force were from the neighborhood they went to New Rochelle high school they
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.520]  you know they went through the school system it's kind of like everybody knows
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.480]  each other kind of thing we're you know we're we're a suburb kind of like right
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:51.000]  outside the Bronx and but you're saying it has a flavor of Mayberry well not not
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.520]  really you know it by Mayberry you know the cops yeah something like that okay
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.600]  and that and that in that regard but um what I've noticed Alex like the past few
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.720]  years there's been well first of all in my in the particular neighborhood where
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.920]  the incident took place with the cop pulling up the gun on the young kids I
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:14.560]  live on sickles that happened like the incident happened like on the way it's
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.520]  like you know kind of like that shoots off of Prince Street but see I drive around
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.440]  that corner all the time and these kids are you know we had a lot of snowstorms
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.680]  here the past you know two weeks so these kids are doing a lot of snowball
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.480]  fighting but they're not stormed snowballs at any of the cars that are
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:35.160]  driving by because I drive by you say you live there you see them they're
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:38.720]  having a good time this is a total bull I mean it's not illegal to have a
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.560]  snowball fights what you're saying it's acting it's always been going on but
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.880]  like I was saying I've noticed in the past few years they're bringing in cops
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:51.200]  who are not from the neighborhood then see on a deeper level I've noticed that
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.840]  they got orders to chop wire cameras up these new like kind of like slim white
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:01.440]  cameras yeah another day is a police state year after year we watched the

[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:31.360]  you live and the systems trying to act like everything is honky-dory just like
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:35.340]  they passed 20 something taxes in Obamacare and then told you it wasn't a
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:41.000]  tax now Obama is trying to cover up those new taxes it's the same game over
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.880]  and over again that's why there's armored vehicles and cops jumping out
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:49.280]  with guns when kids are playing with snowballs that's why there's all this
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:53.760]  freaking out over security because they're getting ready for the big plunge
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:57.040]  they've taken over they've robbed everything they've done everybody down
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:02.560]  they've secured their takeover to a certain extent and they need any crisis
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.760]  they can train everybody they're under martial law just like Boston so that they
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:11.880]  can then be safe in the conversion from a free market society to an oppressive
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:17.920]  collapsed totalitarian society let's go to your phone calls Derek in Wyoming
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:23.920]  thanks for holding her on the air hello Alex thanks for having me on and a
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:28.160]  happy football Sunday you know I wanted to talk about cell phone
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:33.840]  distraction you know this this winter I was handing out some information on
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:37.640]  common core from the Berks are there I'm not in it I'm in my local church but I
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:42.160]  thank God for their information and there's a line about 50 cars and this
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:46.440]  the town about 3,000 people to 6,000 people depends on the oil boom kind of
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:52.200]  crashed now but everyone was on their cell phone 50 cars I was interrupting
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:57.920]  Facebook interest or whatever so that's kind of what we're up against but
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.440]  you know it's frustrating but we got to get involved you know right for
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.040]  commissioner and school board and all that not because I'm good I'd rather
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:09.000]  not do that but we don't do something it's all over no I totally get it and I
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.920]  see people all the time and I don't be honest I'm guilty of it but I'm using
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.160]  GPS on my phone trying to find something to be looking down but it's like
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.560]  looking at a map I'm navigating at least people at red lights don't go people
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:26.920]  doing their makeup people you know on elevators at the grocery store they're
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:31.640]  not interacting with people they're interacting with a little computer that
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:36.120]  they carry around with them well you know right now in Austin they just passed
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:40.800]  a law that if you touch your cell phone while you're driving that you will face
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.280]  a big fine and as a motorcycle rider I don't think that that has come soon
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.360]  enough it is crazy but don't worry now the robots are just gonna drive the car
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:54.000]  and oh it's already been put in your car we didn't tell you we're gonna tax you
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.320]  that way there's no problems see once they start trying to claim you've got
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:02.280]  to live in a totally safe world they've taken over because then only computers
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.480]  and robots can imprison us and quote deliver that safety what they really
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.400]  want is the safety to carry out population reduction thank you Derek

[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:36.880]  between emf and vaccines and all the toxic industrial waste that people are
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.880]  eating every day to fluoride and everything else you don't stand a
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.560]  prayer your children don't stand a prayer if you don't get your gut floor

[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.600]  know red I mean I know you're right Bill Gates is obsessed with the gut flora
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.760]  he's patenting everything our guts are basically dead with all the GMO and the
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:00.880]  pesticides and the food and if that's gone then then you don't have an immune
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.080]  system and the cancer takes over go ahead that's exactly right what we're
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:09.120]  living in his mind calm now Hitler wrote about this stuff Brzezinski wrote
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:14.080]  about this stuff you better understand that the bush cabal for the last 100
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:20.440]  years has done nothing more than attack societies across the globe if you don't

[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.520]  things they've done nothing but recruit the nastiest of the nasty of the
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.520]  scientists I had a roommate who was working in the psychology department he
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:03.240]  was almost done with his master's degree and they threw him out like a piece of
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:07.480]  trash when he questioned the morality and what they were doing oh that's right
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:12.360]  you have to get the PhD by going along with them I know a PhD who changed a
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.880]  bunch of Texas laws I'm not gonna get into it did some really great things for
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:19.880]  father's rights he was about to get his PhD but when he let him know what he's
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.280]  planning to do they tried to deny it and he had to basically start a lawsuit
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.560]  against him just to get it so yes that's how it works that's how they're
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:33.080]  controlling things that's exactly right now pay attention a real good attention

[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.720]  based on the news coverage that I've seen the last week I know that they've
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.440]  been trying to divide and conquer this based on age race sexual preference
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:33.840]  religion social standing and politics now it's medical they won't take the flu

[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.320]  was gonna say they're gonna turn everybody that doesn't take it into the
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:06.040]  ultimate social pariah and they're gonna use social pressure to divide us and
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:09.480]  they're gonna you won't be able to drive a car you won't be able to work yeah
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:13.040]  political correctness and it's like you're not taking your medication it's
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:19.440]  THX 113 a yes sir they're gonna use that because nothing else is working
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.560]  enough so now they're gonna have like invasion of the body snatchers if you're
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:26.000]  if you're not taking your vaccine they're gonna be pointing you out they're

[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:32.440]  now I remember hearing Dr. Dinell like ten years ago go if someone doesn't take
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.760]  a vaccine they should be arrested they're gonna make us sick not like you took
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:39.480]  it but I'm gonna make you sick but then statistically I'm healthier that's what
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:43.040]  we've got to start getting really aggressive in their face with banner hangs
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:47.640]  exposing vaccines with signs exposing the side effects all of us have to get
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:51.320]  really aggressive back in their pushback because we were starting to win about

[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.560]  ahead what what former state are you calling in from I'm calling from the
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:21.360]  former state of Michigan Alex welcome sir go ahead yeah I like to start off by
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:25.600]  saying I bought the infidel body armor I love it great product they're a great
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.720]  sponsor all right my main point is I'm concerned about the USGS covering things
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:36.280]  up as of late you know there have been a crap time at that I'm sorry to use that
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:39.520]  term that's what it is there's been a you know what time there has been a
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.360]  Bravo Sierra time of earthquakes around the country so what you're getting at
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:48.840]  you bet you as of the 22nd of last month there were the hundred and sixteen
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:52.640]  earthquakes to one day in Earthquakes or
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.560]  yeah I need to get Stan Dayo back on the air he was on about a year ago and I
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:00.440]  said I wanted to get him back on a lot and we didn't it's no big deal it's just
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:05.280]  getting on he did predict massive earthquakes in the last quarter of last
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.280]  year in this quarter and he's been right just massive increase in earthquakes
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.760]  what do you think's going on what's behind it the fracking or the pole shift
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.600]  I mean the pole is moving rather quickly towards a pole chef right now oh
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:23.400]  yes I fear I said it's mainly due to the pole shift as of late but this should
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.560]  concern you a Yellowstone geologist has gone against me about a gang order and
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:33.120]  there is a gang order on the archeologist that and within the next two
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.960]  weeks there may very well be interruption you're talking about the
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:40.800]  supervolcano yes sir the Yellowstone supervolcano well they admit that when
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.600]  it blows up the last few times it covers more than half the country and
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:47.000]  molten ash and kills everything that's not important though because the
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.720]  Superbowl's on right now speak that's exactly what I'm talking about a major
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:56.680]  distraction well sounds like racism to me thank you all know that's evil the
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:01.520]  question know about geology and know about stuff that's happening let's go
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.360]  ahead being informed is bad sir just come on please just roll over and die so
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:13.120]  David Rockefeller can run everything JT JT calls from Colorado JT what's on
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:19.760]  your mind tonight hello Alex well it's Superbowl Sunday and I don't know do you
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:26.160]  remember a movie starring Bruce Willis and Damon Williams called the last boy
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:35.320]  scout I did yeah that this is all obfuscation as we both know and 99% of
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:44.000]  the listeners know so the the other obfuscational event was you remember
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:54.280]  what George Bush George W. Bush was doing the day the week actually that his
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:40:03.120]  brother Jeff was presiding over the the slow painful death of Terry Shiveau do
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:13.440]  you remember I don't remind me he was signing the North American Union down
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.400]  in Waco down at Baylor University that's right at Baylor they signed it and they
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.440]  said to the news the treaty is secret and the American people went oh you signed
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:25.240]  secret treaties with the Prime Minister Paul Martin and Vicente Fox the
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:30.400]  president of Mexico that doesn't sound like treason I shouldn't be worried I'm
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:35.600]  worried about deflated footballs but not about secret treaties to gang rape our
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:44.200]  markets I was watching Fox News during that period because I was really just
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:50.960]  totally upset about what was happening with Terry Shiveau and during one break
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:56.040]  there was you know one of the news breaks when the when the what would you
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:01.320]  call her the disinfo babe comes up and gives you the the news headlines they
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:06.840]  mentioned that there was a treaty being signed at Baylor University in Waco
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:12.000]  Texas but I mean see how it's bad that you know about the secret treaty or that
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:18.400]  it was in the news it was secret just don't worry about secret stuff and so
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:25.520]  what if Obamacare raises 21 taxes and doubles or triples prices just accept it
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:28.480]  and so what if they put troops on death list and don't give a medical care
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.440]  they're gonna thank the troops at the Super Bowl as they murder them here's
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:37.760]  the New York Times JT thanks for the call White House seeks to limit health

[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:20.800]  liberal Thomas Jefferson would run vomiting in the other direction from
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:28.640]  them I've had MSNBC personally say I'm a racist because I said that it had tax
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.320]  penalties in the bill I mean you could read it and see that but they just went

[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:35.000]  launch because I'm not just the radio host here I'm the guy that heads up the
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.600]  nightly news the films the documentaries the publications the websites the whole
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:46.600]  operation getting the funding it takes to run this system I want to go back to
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:52.560]  your phone calls but I just briefly wanted to discuss the snowball situation
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:58.040]  I have five videos today we've only played one that's only gave two of the
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:03.440]  guys to even get the show the police tasering people to death and for no
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.520]  reason and then putting them in a hot car to die after they've tasered him I
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:12.040]  have the cop jumping out with his gun aiming it and the the prisoners in the
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.880]  neighborhood in New York put their hands up and everything and he's saying
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.320]  don't move don't move he clearly he just is freaking out wants to kill
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:26.440]  somebody and the menace to public safety is the guy going after folks having a
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:29.880]  snowball fight who are not even throwing them in cars they don't even say they
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:41.400]  were doing that in the news articles I have it's scary but what type of mind
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:46.120]  control have they put the police under that all over the country the cops go
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.640]  crazy like this well you learn that the police officer was called because of
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:55.120]  being told about a quote disturbance so the real trigger was the person looking
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:01.800]  out their window who didn't like seeing somebody having a snowball fight now in
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:04.720]  San Francisco and other areas they call the police on you if they see smoke
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:09.800]  coming out your chimney because that's a carbon tax violation see watch out
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:13.360]  because they can find something like an old tree on your property about to fall
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:19.280]  in your house like my parents the city of Austin wants they've been fighting it
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:26.040]  for about six eight months seventy five thousand dollars to cut an oak tree that's
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:31.520]  basically dead hanging over their house so they've paid all these other fines
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:36.080]  and fees and the rest of it to be able to have a city come out and try to cut
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:41.480]  the tree and they said you know what you can't cut the tree they said fine we'll
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.280]  just have to move out of the house they'll know past seventy five thousand
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.280]  dollars mediation mitigation you know you can cut the tree and so my dad went
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:53.960]  down and talked to city and threatened to swim and they went you know what will
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:50:00.440]  be nice to you ten grand and you can cut your tree is that a free country got a
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:05.200]  dead oak tree hanging over the house over their bedroom
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:11.640]  when's falling off of it on their house it's dead the city of Austin since by
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:15.640]  their little environmental inspectors while GMOs being fed to all of us while
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:19.360]  all the species are being manipulated and mixed I mean we got serious
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:23.200]  environmental crises people look at me they go you're not an environmentalist
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:26.920]  you don't want carbon taxes you know what I don't want to die of cancer I
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:30.640]  don't want to breathe poison air I don't want to drink poison water I'm a real
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.640]  conservationist environmentalist I'm not a eugenicist piggybacked on the movement
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:41.800]  to be anti-human and use as an excuse to take over society Dave RJ Ray and
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.680]  infidel that's all the colors we have time for we got more colors than that
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:49.600]  but let's go to David New York thanks for holding you're on the air Alex
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:56.160]  Jones you're an alpha male you should have been given riddle in a vaccine and
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:59.480]  your mother's womb well I've it's racist even have genitals they should have been
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:06.080]  chopped off at birth seriously though I you know I'm gonna get gonna get the
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:09.640]  Patrick Tillman cuz they talked about him on a Super Bowl commercial or not a
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:13.040]  commercial but one of the segment while they're using a guy they murdered for
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.360]  their for war propaganda what was the ad exactly it wasn't an ad date it Patrick's
[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:25.560]  wife has a foundation for you know one specific person who wins you know that
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:32.520]  they this year's contest or whatever to get the award and it it really ticked me
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:38.880]  off because obviously you know we know what happened to Patrick Tillman and we
[01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.880]  know about Chris Kyle his story was checking out so they made him a dead
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:47.920]  hero that's more valuable yeah and you know so many wants to go online and look
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:51.600]  up Patrick Tillman don't don't just punch in his name cuz you get all the
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.360]  propaganda look up Patrick Tillman's mother and you'll get a better you know
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:00.320]  excellent I've talked to his family and it came out the Army's own report they
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:06.160]  murdered him executed him you know one of the things I heard or watched I have
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:10.920]  one of your DVDs with Aaron Russo that was like one of the best things I ever
[01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:15.280]  saw what a great man you know Aaron Russo was that's right that that final
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.040]  interview when he was down a cancer he could hardly walk on did that his wife
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:23.600]  got pretty upset sweet lady but he was like fighting and pain not gonna get
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:28.760]  into all the details but just to do that interview he died right after pretty
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:34.360]  much right after that few months after that this morning whatever you know with
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:43.080]  Charles whoever is they had a kind of Lisa Rice on saying how you know she
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:48.200]  won in it she didn't say she wanted to be the head of the NFL anymore but it was
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:51.720]  like pinging up to that you almost wonder if she's not gonna end up being
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:54.880]  the head of the NFL you know that absolutely we got a job but thank you
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:58.760]  for the call Ray in Colorado you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:05.280]  hello Alex Hale from a fellow Patriots I hope the Patriots win and I don't mean
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:10.560]  the football team exactly you were talking about the pilots not flying the
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:14.480]  planes I think there's quite a bit of evidence that that's been going for
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:20.760]  quite a while back in the mid 70s the US military developed what they called
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:26.400]  ROV technology remote operate remotely operated vehicles because you're
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:31.400]  limited absurdive hijacking back in the mid 70s yeah they put computers in all
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:37.200]  of them by the early 90s that are remote control yeah they say yeah they started
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:41.000]  putting him into the jet air lives and then I guess early 80s they decided the
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.800]  best way for it to work was to be put into the planes upon their assembly
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:50.800]  originally so they start they built them into the brand new 750 7s and 767 that's
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:54.680]  right just like the cars and both the planes on 9-11 had remote control in
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:59.800]  them that even came out in the back of the paper it's incredible right I'm sorry
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:04.320]  those planes were flown right into the towers with such precision by supposedly
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:08.000]  thoughties that couldn't even land a Cessna according to their trainer those
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.800]  guys couldn't wipe their heinies that's right and you know what I think about
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:18.000]  these drones which we'll be seeing we'll be seeing these chem trailing jets
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.040]  come out as soon as they think everybody's come from comfortably and
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:26.520]  they've been inaugurated I think possibly these chem trailing planes could be
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:31.920]  drone operated they fly straight lines and visibly other I'm sure they are I
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:37.400]  mean Joe Kennedy Jr. died flying a remote control plane he was piloting
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:41.320]  several from his chase plane and then they tack me into this is just things
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:47.160]  remote control planes after 9-11 we know from the calls they were releasing
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:50.960]  nerve gas on board the aircraft to take everybody out the real phone calls
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.640]  where there's smoke I can't breathe they did nerve gas everybody remote control
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.200]  them into the towers who did that we don't know the official story is pure
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:05.160]  bravo Sierra let's go to infidel Christian and RJ go ahead infidel hey
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:11.200]  Alex I want to be really politically incorrect for a minute you racist and I
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:14.280]  want to say I'm a huge supporter of prison planet TV and I love all your
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:19.600]  products but I want to say that to anybody that is still under the delusion
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:25.160]  okay that there is a peaceful Islam or a peaceful Muslim religion that they're
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:29.200]  completely deluding themselves and the Muslims that will tell you that they're
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:33.620]  either not reading their Koran just like the Catholics don't read the Bible and
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:36.640]  most of the Christians don't read the Bible I want to tell people to look up
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:42.480]  zero to 191 okay kill the infidel wherever you find them the 100 over
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:47.360]  100 sword versus that say that the only way to get to heaven is by killing
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:53.600]  infidels are dying in jihad you should prove that you're not not being Islam
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:57.440]  a phobic you should go to Syria or governments find the radicals and have
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.880]  them chop you and your family's heads off I think that would probably make
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.360]  Rachel Maddow happy yeah well where's where's all the reformers that's what I
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:07.960]  want to know if it's so peaceful religion where are all the Muslim
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:11.280]  reformers in America well just ask the Japanese guy that has head chopped off
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:19.040]  today and I think you know we need to be respectful of other cultures and maybe
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:23.520]  the Japanese guy well you know I mean I'm being sarcastic in a sick way I
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:26.600]  actually very sad for the Japanese fellow this is who our government though
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:31.360]  has turned loose on the Middle East what do you say about that so what we
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:34.800]  supported you know yeah everyone's just asleep everyone is just so politically
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.280]  correct that they don't want to come out and and call that's right and then
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:42.600]  when the radical Islamists attack us they can take our rights RJ you got
