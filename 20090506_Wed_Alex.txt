[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:31.640]  Texas Alex Jones there is a hate crimes bill
[00:31.640 --> 00:35.960]  moving its way to the Senate right now it's already out of committee to heavily
[00:35.960 --> 00:40.080]  restrict free speech in the United States there is another bill not being
[00:40.080 --> 00:43.320]  billed as hate speech law but that's what it is it says if you make somebody
[00:43.320 --> 00:47.320]  feel bad this is the Soviet model of hate speech or what they have in England
[00:47.320 --> 00:53.240]  now the government decides if what you said is hurtful and then you will be
[00:53.240 --> 00:59.240]  arrested under a felony I just happen to have the bill and it's strange that I
[00:59.240 --> 01:04.440]  saw this linked by Curt Nemo up on info wars dot com yesterday and I did some
[01:04.440 --> 01:09.160]  net searches on it and didn't find it anywhere else but boing boing one of the
[01:09.160 --> 01:15.920]  big aggregate news sites one of the big aggregators that's it and this is more
[01:15.920 --> 01:20.560]  draconian than any speech bill I've ever seen this is not like the fairness
[01:20.560 --> 01:23.800]  doctrine restricting what you can and can't say on talk radio this isn't a
[01:23.800 --> 01:28.160]  fairness doctrine for the internet this is you will be charged with a felony if
[01:28.160 --> 01:32.200]  you say something that hurts somebody's feelings and in Canada and in Europe we
[01:32.200 --> 01:36.960]  know what this model is you speak out against foreigners overrunning the
[01:36.960 --> 01:41.200]  government the government bringing them in with welfare money to break down the
[01:41.200 --> 01:45.320]  society and to have a voting block to leverage out the indigenous population
[01:45.320 --> 01:51.360]  you get fined you get feed you get arrested I mean it's really happening
[01:51.360 --> 01:55.360]  and finally maybe some Americans will become concerned because Michael
[01:55.360 --> 02:03.320]  Savage one of the neo-king neo-con kings of talk radio one of the kings of
[02:03.320 --> 02:07.520]  neocondom who's called for putting people to disagree with the war and forced
[02:07.520 --> 02:12.240]  labor camps he's now getting some of his own medicine and they're saying hey we
[02:12.240 --> 02:16.160]  don't like your behavior criticizing immigrants and open borders that's
[02:16.160 --> 02:21.640]  actually what Joaquin I like to call her no actually Jackie Smith the home
[02:21.640 --> 02:25.800]  secretary running the big brother command system in airstrip one she said
[02:25.800 --> 02:30.080]  you don't get to come here and this is a message to Brits and others you'll be
[02:30.080 --> 02:36.840]  arrested if you talk like him so this is the political correctness gone to the
[02:36.840 --> 02:40.720]  next level this is where it's supposed to go we needed a tailed article at
[02:40.720 --> 02:44.200]  prisonplanet.com or info wars.com because every time I mentioned BBC
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.520]  reporters being arrested for saying the word homosexual I'm not kidding Robin
[02:48.520 --> 02:53.840]  Page and others folks don't believe me I'm getting emails and see comments hey
[02:53.840 --> 02:56.640]  if you don't know how to use a search engine I'm sorry for you but it's all
[02:56.640 --> 03:03.280]  posted on info wars.com prisonplanet.com in years past but since we're you know
[03:03.280 --> 03:08.200]  not in Christmas past but Christmas present we'll write some new articles
[03:08.200 --> 03:12.960]  about that because this is a central issue and so what I need Paul Watson to
[03:12.960 --> 03:19.720]  do is to do a master article kind of a lexicon of a few dozen of the big
[03:19.720 --> 03:24.360]  mainstream news articles where they report it's good you know the BBC saying
[03:24.360 --> 03:30.440]  oh it's good our reporter was arrested with his rural affairs show you don't
[03:30.440 --> 03:35.800]  say the word homosexual that hurts people's feelings you see because you
[03:35.800 --> 03:38.720]  can ban any word you want this Orwellian system by having one of the
[03:38.720 --> 03:45.440]  capped pet groups in Germany it was the Nazi party today you know a gay or
[03:45.440 --> 03:49.080]  lesbian group has nothing to do with gay or lesbians it's just a political
[03:49.080 --> 03:55.240]  weapon and they say oh we've decided the word homosexual hurts our feelings and
[03:55.240 --> 03:59.120]  of course they're proposing in Canada England Australia Europe proper on the
[03:59.120 --> 04:06.240]  continent itself to come right out and ban criticizing man-made climate change
[04:06.240 --> 04:09.640]  because they don't want us debating them they don't want to showing that it's the
[04:09.640 --> 04:14.880]  Sun activity that drives the whole Kit Kat and Kaboodle they want to shut down
[04:14.880 --> 04:18.960]  debate they are announcing that they're going to shut down debate that they're
[04:18.960 --> 04:23.320]  going to restrict free speech they've introduced bills you know there's a
[04:23.320 --> 04:26.600]  San Francisco Chronicle article today going what's up with these crazy gun
[04:26.600 --> 04:30.720]  owners you know if you thought gun sales were had doubled well now they've even
[04:30.720 --> 04:34.760]  increased its all-time records with literal people waiting outside gun
[04:34.760 --> 04:39.280]  shops in the morning when they open and gun shows running and grabbing
[04:39.280 --> 04:44.080]  everything not nailed down foaming at the mouth these people are totally
[04:44.080 --> 04:48.760]  insane there there's no gun control now they just introduced a treaty that CNN
[04:48.760 --> 04:53.480]  even reports will basically ban guns in the US the Attorney General says ban all
[04:53.480 --> 04:58.240]  guns before the Supreme Court but their their military tactic is to deny deny
[04:58.240 --> 05:03.200]  deny this is not an assault stand down a springtime now that you planted your

[08:19.160 --> 08:22.480]  Daniel Estlum but two different Builderberg sources along with Jim Tucker
[08:22.480 --> 08:32.120]  reporting that they plan to run oil in 2006 up from $65 a barrel to 150 but they
[08:32.120 --> 08:35.800]  would then run the stock market back up and then plunge it by popping the
[08:35.800 --> 08:40.920]  subprime mortgage real estate market now those are exact words and that is
[08:40.920 --> 08:45.600]  exactly what happened and that's also we put a clip of that in the Obama
[08:45.600 --> 08:52.240]  deception now Glenn Beck reportedly at the last two nights has been covering
[08:52.240 --> 08:56.040]  Builderberg group and how they're planning to destroy America so now Fox
[08:56.040 --> 09:00.560]  News is talking about Builderberg group when sky television owned by Rupert
[09:00.560 --> 09:04.960]  Murdoch did hit pieces on me just three years ago saying it didn't exist
[09:04.960 --> 09:10.320]  there's a report up on prisonplanet.com from Daniel Estlum leaked agenda
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.320]  Builderberg group plans economic depression a leaders divided on whether
[09:14.320 --> 09:18.440]  to quickly sink economy and replace it with New World Order are set in motion
[09:18.440 --> 09:24.320]  long agonizing depression well they've already implemented the long agonizing
[09:24.320 --> 09:28.360]  depression and I will tell you that is the game plan but remember you know
[09:28.360 --> 09:31.560]  Tucker was able to say they're gonna have a stage falling in the Berlin wall
[09:31.560 --> 09:35.880]  next year from Builderberg they were able to say Bush is gonna sign on to
[09:35.880 --> 09:39.640]  Kyoto and say he believes in manmade global warming and most the Republican
[09:39.640 --> 09:44.080]  Party is and they did months after that was reported in 2007 from Istanbul
[09:44.080 --> 09:50.360]  Turkey that's an endgame and then we told you in 2008 it was gonna be Barack
[09:50.360 --> 09:55.480]  Obama he was there they literally kidnapped the press they told him get on
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.200]  a plane get on Obama's campaign plane he's about to be here get on Hillary's
[09:59.200 --> 10:03.760]  plane they're all going to Chicago two different and then suddenly Obama went
[10:03.760 --> 10:06.960]  on the plane they locked the doors and took off and the press secretary said
[10:06.960 --> 10:10.720]  oh he's in a secret meeting then they took the media on a goose chase of three
[10:10.720 --> 10:15.000]  different houses Diane Feinstein another weren't there well we contacted the media
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.160]  and said they're right here media didn't care wouldn't report on it that's why
[10:20.160 --> 10:24.120]  the Obama deception is so important so I'm gonna read this article coming up at
[10:24.120 --> 10:27.280]  the bottom of the hour but it's up on prisonplanet.com right now on the eve
[10:27.280 --> 10:32.560]  of the 2009 Bilderberg group conference which is due to be held at the five-star
[10:32.560 --> 10:38.200]  palace hotel in Greece investigators reported reported Daniel Estlin has
[10:38.200 --> 10:41.800]  uncovered shocking details of what the elitist plan to do with the economy over
[10:41.800 --> 10:45.200]  the course of the next year the Bilderberg group meeting is an annual
[10:45.200 --> 10:48.760]  confab around 150 of the world's most influential power brokers and government
[10:48.760 --> 10:52.960]  industry banking media academia military industrial complex the secret of group
[10:52.960 --> 10:57.440]  operates under Chatham House rules meaning that no details of what is discussed
[10:57.440 --> 11:01.680]  never be leaked to the media despite editors of the world's biggest newspapers
[11:01.680 --> 11:04.760]  the Washington Post the New York Times the Financial Times of London being
[11:04.760 --> 11:10.360]  present at the meetings according to excellent sources that would have always
[11:10.360 --> 11:14.560]  been impeccable which have proven highly accurate in the past Bilderberg is
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.320]  divided on whether to put into motion either a prolonged agonizing depression
[11:19.320 --> 11:24.920]  that dooms the world to decades of stagnation decline in poverty are an
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.400]  intense but short depression that paves the way for the new sustainable
[11:29.400 --> 11:34.040]  economic world order with less sovereignty but more efficiency the
[11:34.040 --> 11:38.960]  information takes an added weight when one considers that the fact that Estlin's
[11:38.960 --> 11:42.920]  previous economic forecast which were based on leaks from the same sources
[11:42.920 --> 11:48.280]  have proven deadly accurate Estlin correctly predicted the housing crash
[11:48.280 --> 11:53.440]  in 2008 financial meltdown as a result of what his sources inside Bilderberg
[11:53.440 --> 11:58.040]  told him the elite were planning based on what was said at their 2006 meeting in
[11:58.040 --> 12:02.840]  Canada and 2007 conference in Turkey details the economic agenda were
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.600]  contained in a pre-meeting booklet handed out to Bilderberg members on a more
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.760]  specific note Estlin warns that Bilderberg are fostering a false picture of
[12:11.760 --> 12:16.800]  economic recovery suckering investors into plowing their money same thing in
[12:16.800 --> 12:22.000]  2006 back in a stock market again only to later unleash another massive
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.600]  downturn which will create massive losses and searing financial pain in the
[12:27.600 --> 12:31.120]  months ahead according to Canadian Free Press report according to Estlin
[12:31.120 --> 12:34.720]  Bilderberg is assuming that US unemployment figures will reach around
[12:34.720 --> 12:38.440]  14% by the end of the year they're already really at 18 folks according
[12:38.440 --> 12:43.800]  almost doubling the current figure of 8.1% that's the cook number Estlin sources
[12:43.800 --> 12:48.720]  also tell him that Bilderberg will again attempt to push for the enactment of the
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.960]  Libs and Treaty a key centerpiece of the agenda to fully entrench the federal
[12:53.960 --> 12:58.160]  EU super state by forcing the Irish to vote again on the document that in
[12:58.160 --> 13:02.080]  September and October despite having rejected it already along with the
[13:02.080 --> 13:06.920]  European nations in national referendums I'm gonna read more of this coming up
[13:06.920 --> 13:09.520]  when I get more into detail at the bottom of the hour I've got some other news I
[13:09.520 --> 13:14.600]  want to cover first but here's the issue everything Estlin saying is already
[13:14.600 --> 13:19.600]  in parliament meetings I watch online the European Parliament has their own
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.880]  stinking YouTube channel just like Obama does but it's helpful because I've sent
[13:24.880 --> 13:28.120]  and watched hours of it and there's hours of debate every day there's no way
[13:28.120 --> 13:31.640]  for anybody to watch at all but you should go watch it and see what you can
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.040]  find I mean it's unbelievable they openly announced world government world
[13:35.040 --> 13:39.440]  taxation world regulation a new world super state run by a bank of the world
[13:39.440 --> 13:44.080]  that'll tax everything we do world taxing authorities tax rates of 80%
[13:44.080 --> 13:48.760]  globally how they're gonna force in September if they can another Libs and
[13:48.760 --> 13:53.840]  Treaty vote not just in Ironland but they're gonna try and in several other
[13:53.840 --> 14:03.040]  nations we just talked to Eston he said he will come on Eston just had twins a
[14:03.040 --> 14:07.080]  year ago he's been very hard to get on since then but he promised that before
[14:07.080 --> 14:10.320]  Bilderberg he would come back home and I talked to him a few weeks ago Rob just

[15:51.960 --> 15:58.120]  ladies and gentlemen this is a controlled depression just like we have
[15:58.120 --> 16:04.280]  George Soros at the Davos Switzerland meeting two months ago kind of the
[16:04.280 --> 16:08.780]  public Bilderberg group meeting that's what it is the public face of
[16:08.780 --> 16:14.720]  Bilderberg and he's there and he says yeah we've plunged gas prices oil prices
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.960]  artificially to bankrupt Venezuela Russia in the Middle East to help bring
[16:19.960 --> 16:23.600]  in the world depression and then that then he got in mainstream news two weeks
[16:23.600 --> 16:28.320]  ago and said I'm having a great crisis this is the culmination of my life and
[16:28.320 --> 16:35.520]  my work inserts bragging how he's involved engineering and they and that
[16:35.520 --> 16:39.480]  was in scores of papers because that was in a press conference just Google
[16:39.480 --> 16:46.000]  George Soros I'm having a great crisis I mean this is the type of stuff this
[16:46.000 --> 16:53.640]  guy does and then meanwhile we've got Bilderberg being talked about by Becky
[16:53.640 --> 16:57.480]  and of course he said he's gonna get to the bottom of Bilderberg doesn't exist
[16:57.480 --> 17:01.320]  I'm sure he'll tell us in a month I looked at it I really wanted to believe
[17:01.320 --> 17:07.600]  it existed it doesn't exist or oh I've got a strong man for you I'm gonna tell
[17:07.600 --> 17:11.520]  you if the camps exist a month later I'm sorry they don't exist I I've got a
[17:11.520 --> 17:16.040]  straw man for you the government admits they exist but I'll go to one kook thing
[17:16.040 --> 17:24.120]  that Alex has been exposing for a decade and we'll hang it around his neck and I'm
[17:24.120 --> 17:30.400]  gonna tell you we're gonna get to the bottom of the president you know we
[17:30.400 --> 17:34.960]  told you day one last week when it came out that the you had Air Force two one
[17:34.960 --> 17:40.680]  of the Air Force spares one of the five doomsday planes literally is their
[17:40.680 --> 17:44.280]  nickname in the Air Force because they fly around as mobile command centers as
[17:44.280 --> 17:49.200]  the president's backup you have it flying between buildings at just a few
[17:49.200 --> 17:52.520]  hundred yards away the F-16s were 50 yards away the news was reporting I
[17:52.520 --> 17:56.640]  mean screaming right by buildings people were totally terrified they were
[17:56.640 --> 18:02.040]  flying back and forth in lower Manhattan and I got on air and I said
[18:02.040 --> 18:05.240]  ladies and gentlemen they knew this would terrorize people there's been no
[18:05.240 --> 18:12.680]  big air traffic letting we're around there since 9-11 people panic when they
[18:12.680 --> 18:16.640]  see assessment of flying off course out there they knew what this was this is
[18:16.640 --> 18:20.120]  some type of Psiop and then it comes out that there are secret documents on
[18:20.120 --> 18:24.760]  record where the Secret Service FBI and others were told a month before we're
[18:24.760 --> 18:29.880]  gonna do this don't tell the locals tell the police but don't tell the mayor and
[18:29.880 --> 18:33.840]  we're gonna do this and then they said we're not gonna tell you what it's for
[18:33.840 --> 18:39.240]  then they claimed it was a photo op when anybody could have just photoshopped
[18:39.240 --> 18:43.720]  Air Force 1 flying by New York I mean this is bizarre what is the Psiop I
[18:43.720 --> 18:50.840]  don't know clearly you can guess it's meant to bring back fears of 9-11 in
[18:50.840 --> 18:56.560]  the middle of the swine flu epidemic the so-called pandemic that they were
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.720]  hyping to somehow the psychiatrist testing this and the psych warfare
[19:01.720 --> 19:08.120]  divisions and black ops believed it would magnify the mass psychosis in and
[19:08.120 --> 19:14.000]  maybe implant the psychosis in others that don't have a medical phobia but
[19:14.000 --> 19:21.480]  somehow bring back the 9-11 fear which gave Bush a 90 plus percent approval
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.240]  writing in the rallying around the savior system mode rallying around the
[19:26.240 --> 19:32.080]  chief mode and to create some type of mass neurosis I that's probably what it
[19:32.080 --> 19:37.840]  is and then now they admit it's secret we're not gonna tell you it's not really
[19:37.840 --> 19:41.520]  a photo op we're not gonna release photos we're just gonna terrorize you when
[19:41.520 --> 19:45.960]  you feel like it and if you don't like it a swat table drop by you know that's
[19:45.960 --> 19:50.400]  how things work now by the way there's all these articles you know or is the
[19:50.400 --> 19:55.160]  government planning to take your pension funds of course they are that's what the
[19:55.160 --> 19:58.360]  arm of World Bank documents and their planning and the attacks on free

[32:58.000 --> 33:19.920]  eight hundred four zero nine five six three
[33:19.920 --> 33:24.160]  we'll see if I'm able to get Daniel last one was breaking inside info he has
[33:24.160 --> 33:28.240]  contacts with two actual Bilderberg members that's right even out of a
[33:28.240 --> 33:32.520]  hundred and twenty five of the world's elite we got a couple of them that's at
[33:32.520 --> 33:37.320]  great risk of themselves leak us information that's been a secret for
[33:37.320 --> 33:45.680]  many years it's no longer a secret so we'll put that out here on air and that's
[33:45.680 --> 33:48.360]  the reason the new owner is going to fall they've got infiltrators in our
[33:48.360 --> 33:53.480]  midst and no doubt of that we've got infiltrators in their midst and so the
[33:53.480 --> 33:58.440]  battle goes on eternal okay it's just I've got absolutely masses of vital
[33:58.440 --> 34:01.880]  news and information I want to do a breakdown on the attack on the first
[34:01.880 --> 34:06.160]  amendment it is so massive here in the United States the attack on free speech
[34:06.160 --> 34:12.080]  globally is just going at light speed I mean just ten years ago they would call
[34:12.080 --> 34:16.240]  this hardcore tyranny what's happening in Europe England and Canada it would be
[34:16.240 --> 34:20.480]  called hardcore soviet slash Nazi tyranny everything we were taught in
[34:20.480 --> 34:25.440]  school ever I mean just everything secret police cameras spying on citizens the
[34:25.440 --> 34:29.440]  military on the streets the military taking over schools and turning them
[34:29.440 --> 34:34.840]  into open recruiting grounds youth brigades tattletale squads I mean let's
[34:34.840 --> 34:39.040]  say there's a list of 200 that's just a random number but I mean I could fill up
[34:39.040 --> 34:44.880]  200 easy 200 things a tyrant does 200 things a turn he does they're doing
[34:44.880 --> 34:52.560]  every single one of them chiefly trying to intimidate everybody and and admit
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.240]  they're setting up tyranny to scare learned and well-read and people that
[34:57.240 --> 35:01.000]  are informed historically and folks that have street smarts and no tyranny when
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.680]  they see it even if they haven't studied history now that acclimates the further
[35:06.680 --> 35:10.880]  you know dumb down public that just further dumps them down to just accept
[35:10.880 --> 35:14.880]  tyranny is normal and the tyranny's freedom but for those of us that are
[35:14.880 --> 35:20.920]  informed it is an open declaration of war and a sharp-clawed threat to
[35:20.920 --> 35:28.640]  everybody and it is a chilling effect and societies that give into the chilling
[35:28.640 --> 35:33.320]  effect always fall to the worst and blackest forms of a corruption and
[35:33.320 --> 35:37.480]  oppression and there's no doubt they have thrown down the gauntlet they have
[35:37.480 --> 35:42.240]  blown their trumpet of war they are engaging us on every front I mean look
[35:42.240 --> 35:48.000]  when they savagely are stealing upwards of two trillion a month folks when
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.560]  they're stealing two trillion a month just in the banker takeover and Congress
[35:52.560 --> 35:57.480]  wants another 92 billion a month here and a 50 something billion there I mean
[35:57.480 --> 36:03.160]  they have they have butchered us if you want an analogy they have decapitated
[36:03.160 --> 36:06.480]  the country the country's already bled out that much money we're totally
[36:06.480 --> 36:11.640]  bankrupt it's over just they've put enough torpedoes into us let's say we're
[36:11.640 --> 36:17.920]  a hundred thousand ton battleship they put about 500 torpedoes into us I mean
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.320]  they hit us with everything they blew us sky high the magazine blew up we're on
[36:22.320 --> 36:27.720]  the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean okay there's your maritime World War two
[36:27.720 --> 36:34.000]  naval engagement analogy they blew this country to bits they broke the family up
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.840]  they've got the population that's indigenous at a 1.3 percent replacement
[36:39.840 --> 36:44.960]  rate of the children the country's dead the West is dead overrun gone over done
[36:44.960 --> 36:54.240]  destroyed new world order victory now that said that is if we continue down
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.680]  this current path if we have a complete revelation a restoration of freedom and
[36:59.680 --> 37:04.160]  liberty a complete revolution individually in our minds if we are born
[37:04.160 --> 37:08.000]  again in the spirit of liberty and freedom against tyranny if we have
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.320]  complete conversions to face what we're dealing with and to shake off the
[37:13.320 --> 37:18.040]  propaganda and the brainwashing and get our will back and get our fury back and
[37:18.040 --> 37:24.680]  get our guts back this will only make us stronger we start with the financial
[37:24.680 --> 37:31.400]  issue you know these dirt bag criminal bankers offshore that have spent 14
[37:31.400 --> 37:35.280]  plus trillion dollars in seven months the new numbers as you know came out two
[37:35.280 --> 37:41.320]  days ago it was 12.8 now it's 14 plus drill AP says 14.2 Bloomberg saying
[37:41.320 --> 37:50.760]  14.8 regardless it's over 14 trill that is a trillion more than the GDP seven
[37:50.760 --> 37:55.920]  months in they're gonna be at 26 trillion I know I keep making this point
[37:55.920 --> 38:01.200]  26 trillion a year into the bank or takeover now that's double the GDP in a
[38:01.200 --> 38:06.600]  year that's criminal that's a fraud that would more than twice over pay off all
[38:06.600 --> 38:11.560]  the mortgages in the United States not the bad mortgages not the jumbo loans
[38:11.560 --> 38:21.040]  not the no all the mortgages more than twice twice all the credit card debt all
[38:21.040 --> 38:27.600]  the car loans everything it pay everything off you could pay off all the
[38:27.600 --> 38:32.160]  housing loans all of them all mortgages mortgages on 60 million dollar pent
[38:32.160 --> 38:37.720]  houses and 20 million dollar chateaus and 200,000 dollar bungalows and
[38:37.720 --> 38:43.920]  100,000 dollar rural homes everything paid off interest everything 30 year
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.960]  mortgages everything pay it off one time with 12.9 trillion according to
[38:49.960 --> 38:52.600]  Bloomberg and AP and others that have broken it down like you can Google that
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.840]  headline bailout would pay for mortgages now that they're gonna double that that
[38:57.840 --> 39:01.320]  would pay off all the credit cards many times over all the car loans many times
[39:01.320 --> 39:06.240]  over small business loans over and over everything so when they sit there going
[39:06.240 --> 39:11.640]  oh we're still trying to unclog a few bad mortgages they are liars they are
[39:11.640 --> 39:21.320]  selling you on fraudulent debt you do not oh they are selling you on a fraud on
[39:21.320 --> 39:30.960]  Ponzi made up shyster projections holograms of wealth it's a simulation
[39:30.960 --> 39:34.760]  and they're telling you oh we're gonna fix it just give us trillions more every
[39:34.760 --> 39:39.040]  month oh look at the army's here to run checkpoints the governor doesn't like it
[39:39.040 --> 39:42.280]  in Tennessee so what we're doing it oh the Marines are here at drunk driving
[39:42.280 --> 39:46.640]  checkpoints that's okay for the community that's good oh we're taking over
[39:46.640 --> 39:51.200]  all these big public schools the Marine Corps taking over public schools and and
[39:51.200 --> 39:53.880]  the Marines are gonna run it and then they threaten your kids they've got a
[39:53.880 --> 40:00.360]  sign on to join or they're arrested totally illegal they just do it and all
[40:00.360 --> 40:04.740]  over the news every day I see scores of articles where police just openly pull
[40:04.740 --> 40:09.600]  people over now in Texas and Alabama and Illinois and everywhere just take your
[40:09.600 --> 40:15.640]  car take your jewelry they just grab women's jewelry officially and nothing
[40:15.640 --> 40:21.440]  happens I've got several articles today just did nothing we're like Mexico to
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.760]  just collapsing thieving stealing the police and government grabbing
[40:25.760 --> 40:30.640]  everything they didn't nail down cops pull you over in Illinois this is a nice
[40:30.640 --> 40:37.320]  sick or vet this is a nice SRT charger that's one of the ones in the article
[40:37.320 --> 40:44.120]  I'm taking it I like it and if the person argues they take them down to the
[40:44.120 --> 40:47.440]  police station this is in CNN today they get reporting on the locals so they
[40:47.440 --> 40:50.520]  don't tell you the feds are doing it as well you'll go oh look at this east
[40:50.520 --> 40:54.440]  Texas town they pull you over and they take your jewelry and wallet and they
[40:54.440 --> 40:58.600]  take you to the police station and they tell you they're gonna charge you with
[40:58.600 --> 41:03.480]  money laundering if you don't sign an agreement to give it to them total
[41:03.480 --> 41:08.240]  Soviet Union sign this or we'll put you in prison there have been Texas cases
[41:08.240 --> 41:13.120]  where they take one case four thousand dollars out of a woman's 80 something
[41:13.120 --> 41:17.320]  year old woman out of her purse woman had no criminal record it was her money
[41:17.320 --> 41:21.280]  everybody knows all women carry around a lot of money when on road trips and they
[41:21.280 --> 41:25.720]  just took it and the court said you can keep it it's it doesn't matter hey all
[41:25.720 --> 41:34.080]  ladies exist for cops to pull them over and take their money and you know what
[41:34.080 --> 41:39.120]  happens the system protects the bad cops that were a minority so the good
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.480]  cops get out the public begins to hate the police and mistrust them and that's
[41:43.480 --> 41:46.720]  what the new order loves even more they love the gang psychology of now the
[41:46.720 --> 41:50.280]  public really starts hating the cops so the cops start hearing the briefings see
[41:50.280 --> 41:53.640]  everybody's against you you got to stick together we got to cover up for bad
[41:53.640 --> 41:58.640]  cops or you know they'll they'll overrun us and then the culture gets more and
[41:58.640 --> 42:09.680]  more and more and more corrupt that's how this works and it's all planned out
[42:09.680 --> 42:15.600]  and it's working like a charm and the bankers set off shore in Switzerland and
[42:15.600 --> 42:20.920]  in Portugal and in Spain and in the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin
[42:20.920 --> 42:26.680]  Islands and in the Turks and Caicos and in the Cook Islands and a new ceiling and
[42:26.680 --> 42:30.040]  big armored compounds with guards with machine guns and they just sit around
[42:30.040 --> 42:34.960]  waging war worldwide with huge supercomputers systematically tracking
[42:34.960 --> 42:38.560]  how they're running their operations so I'm going to get into the attack on the
[42:38.560 --> 42:42.240]  First Amendment a few minutes but first let me read this article and break it
[42:42.240 --> 42:50.960]  down up on prisonplanet.com that needs to go mega viral right now leaked agenda
[42:50.960 --> 42:55.800]  Bilderberg group plans economic depression on the eve of the 2009
[42:55.800 --> 43:01.400]  Bilderberg group conference which is due to be held at the five-star Aster
[43:01.400 --> 43:05.040]  Palace Hotel in Greece investigative reported annual Iceland is uncovered
[43:05.040 --> 43:10.080]  shocking details of what the elites plan to do with the economy over the course
[43:10.080 --> 43:12.840]  of the next year the Bilderberg group meeting is an annual confab around
[43:12.840 --> 43:15.960]  150 of the world's most influential power brokers and government industry
[43:15.960 --> 43:19.040]  banking media academia military national complex the secretive group
[43:19.040 --> 43:23.680]  operates under Chatham House rules meaning that no details of what is
[43:23.680 --> 43:26.960]  discussed can ever be leaked to the media despite editors the world's biggest
[43:26.960 --> 43:30.560]  newspapers the Washington Post New York Times financial times being present at
[43:30.560 --> 43:37.760]  the meeting and finally mainstream news is reporting Bilderberg and their leaked
[43:37.760 --> 43:41.480]  minutes where they set up the EU covertly they set up NAFTA and GAT
[43:41.480 --> 43:44.880]  covertly they're the ones calling for world government they're the reason you
[43:44.880 --> 43:47.560]  know they're the financiers while you hear every politician talking about our
[43:47.560 --> 43:52.120]  global community and our regions no longer nations as they just brainwash
[43:52.120 --> 43:57.640]  the public or an excellent source which has proven highly accurate in the past
[43:57.640 --> 44:03.600]  Bilderberg is divided on whether to put into motion either a prolonged agonizing
[44:03.600 --> 44:08.120]  depression that dooms the world the decades of stagnation decline in poverty
[44:08.120 --> 44:13.040]  are an intense but shorter depression that paves the way for a new sustainable
[44:13.040 --> 44:19.560]  economic new world order now now folks a sustainable economic world order paves
[44:19.560 --> 44:25.760]  the way for an efficient when you hear stuff like this with less sovereign
[44:25.760 --> 44:29.000]  more efficiency more efficiency means you don't have a high standard of living
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.720]  they say that's bad for the earth they say they want to lower your standard
[44:31.720 --> 44:36.160]  of living that's what that means they consolidate industry into a managed
[44:36.160 --> 44:41.000]  economy the information takes on added weight when one considers the fact of
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.480]  excellence previous economic forecast which were based on leaks from the same
[44:45.480 --> 44:49.560]  sources I would add Bilderberg group members Paul please add the in-game link
[44:49.560 --> 44:55.360]  to that and please add once you've linked to the clip that'd be I think part
[44:55.360 --> 45:02.160]  three of Esteline part three from we find them on the web chopped up of the
[45:02.160 --> 45:07.000]  Obama deception because we cover his predictions we know with him in the
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.800]  hotel saying no they told me they're gonna run gas up from forty five sixty
[45:10.800 --> 45:14.520]  dollars a barrel to a hundred and fifty to bankrupt everything and then they're
[45:14.520 --> 45:18.280]  gonna plunge the stock market for sucking everybody in in 2008 exactly what
[45:18.280 --> 45:24.440]  happened again as previous predictions have proven deadly accurate Esteline
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.440]  correctly predicted the housing crash 2008 financial meltdown as a result of
[45:28.440 --> 45:32.240]  what sources said Bilderberg told him where the elite planning based on what
[45:32.240 --> 45:37.160]  was said at their 2006 meeting in Canada 2007 conference in Turkey the tales of
[45:37.160 --> 45:40.520]  the economic agenda were contained in a pre-meeting booklet being handed out
[45:40.520 --> 45:44.960]  Bilderberg members on a more specific note Esteline warns that Bilderberg are
[45:44.960 --> 45:48.960]  fostering a false picture of economic recovery sucking investors into plowing
[45:48.960 --> 45:53.720]  their money in the stock market again only to later unleash another massive
[45:53.720 --> 45:58.640]  downturn which will create massive losses and searing financial pain in the
[45:58.640 --> 46:02.720]  months ahead reports the Canadian Free Press linking to his report yeah I would
[46:02.720 --> 46:07.920]  I would say here that this is exactly how they operate and this is exactly what
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.600]  all our folks with inside connections have been reporting to us but also what
[46:12.600 --> 46:19.040]  Soros and others are bragging publicly they can't help themselves is that they're
[46:19.040 --> 46:22.760]  gonna jack it up another time before they plunge it again but each time they
[46:22.760 --> 46:28.440]  jack it up it doesn't go to the previous height of the last time so what I
[46:28.440 --> 46:33.400]  would do if I had stocks and bonds and I said this when it was at 14,000 and I
[46:33.400 --> 46:39.200]  said this when it was back up at 12,000 I said folks when it hits a high dump
[46:39.200 --> 46:44.200]  half of what you got now that's what I do you know take your own advice that's
[46:44.200 --> 46:48.140]  that that's what I would do dump half of what you got but be safe heads your
[46:48.140 --> 46:57.640]  vets one of their concerns is addressing and
[46:57.640 --> 47:05.360]  neutralizing the anti-libson a treaty movement called Libertas led by Declan
[47:05.360 --> 47:11.480]  Ganley one of the Bilderberg planned moves is to use a widespread campaign in
[47:11.480 --> 47:16.480]  the US media suggesting that Ganley is being funded by an arms dealer in the
[47:16.480 --> 47:22.000]  US linked to the US military yeah they always do stuff like that that's what
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.400]  the government uses conspiracy theories against people with no proof like they
[47:25.400 --> 47:29.480]  say I work for some Saudi person no proof it's always just made up or I work
[47:29.480 --> 47:35.400]  for the Vatican no proof always made up or they say I work for ABC total lie we
[47:35.400 --> 47:40.000]  lease a satellite that's how you're on radio but see notice how we're under
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.880]  attack the same ways folks these are operatives that are doing this or they're
[47:43.880 --> 47:49.600]  useful idiots who are just mentally ill and they've sure screwed the society up
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.920]  Daniel Essel and Jim Tucker and other sources who have infiltrated Bilderberg
[47:54.920 --> 47:57.960]  meetings in the past have routinely provided information about the Bilderberg
[47:57.960 --> 48:02.680]  agenda that later plays out on the world stage proving that the organization is
[48:02.680 --> 48:06.760]  not merely a talking shop as debunkers claim well previously debunkers that it
[48:06.760 --> 48:11.360]  didn't exist but an integral planning forum for the New World Order agenda
[48:11.360 --> 48:16.440]  indeed just last month Belgian Viscount and current Bilderberg chairman Etienne
[48:16.440 --> 48:22.080]  Dabinion bragged that Bilderberg helped create the euro by first introducing the
[48:22.080 --> 48:25.280]  policy agenda we have a link to a mainstream article there for a single
[48:25.280 --> 48:29.280]  currency in the 1990s Bilderberg's agenda for a European federal superstate
[48:29.280 --> 48:35.560]  and a single currency likely backed even further a BBC investigation
[48:35.560 --> 48:38.560]  uncovers documents from the early Bilderberg meetings which confirmed the
[48:38.560 --> 48:42.520]  European Union was a brainchild of Bilderberg in the spring of 2002 in the
[48:42.520 --> 48:46.040]  Warhawks in the Bush administration were pushing for a summer invasion of Iraq
[48:46.040 --> 48:49.840]  Bilderberg's expressed their desire to delay for a year and the attack was not
[48:49.840 --> 48:54.040]  launched until March the following year in 2006 Esselen predicted that the US
[48:54.040 --> 48:58.480]  housing market would be allowed to soar before the bubble was currently popped
[48:58.480 --> 49:03.600]  which is exactly what happened in 2008 Esselen predicted that Bilderberg were
[49:03.600 --> 49:08.200]  creating the conditions for a financial calamity which is exactly what began
[49:08.200 --> 49:10.960]  a few months later with the collapse of Lehman Brothers
[49:10.960 --> 49:15.120]  Bilderberg has routinely flexed his muscles in establishing its role as
[49:15.120 --> 49:20.440]  kingmaker the organization routinely selects presidents candidates as well
[49:20.440 --> 49:23.040]  as running mates and prime ministers Bill Clinton and Tony Blair were both
[49:23.040 --> 49:26.840]  groomed by the secret of organization nearly 1990s before rising to prominence
[49:26.840 --> 49:31.400]  Barack Obama's running mate Joe Biden was selected by Bilderberg luminaries
[49:31.400 --> 49:36.480]  James A. Johnson and John Kerry 2004 running mate John Edwards were also
[49:36.480 --> 49:40.960]  annoyed by the group so was Rick Perry I would add after he gave a glowing speech
[49:40.960 --> 49:45.240]  at the conference in 2004 Bilderberg attendees even broke house rules to
[49:45.240 --> 49:49.160]  applaud Edwards at the end of a speech he gave to the elitist about American
[49:49.160 --> 49:54.040]  politics the choice of Edwards was shocking to media pundits who had
[49:54.040 --> 50:01.520]  fully expected Dick Gephardt to secure the position in the 2004 VP position the
[50:01.520 --> 50:06.440]  New York Post even reported that Gephardt had been chosen and Kerry Gephardt
[50:06.440 --> 50:10.880]  stickers were being placed on campaign vehicles before being removed when
[50:10.880 --> 50:15.240]  Edwards was announced as Kerry's number two under orders of Bilderberg 2008
[50:15.240 --> 50:22.080]  Portuguese newspaper report highlighted the fact that Pedro Santana Lopez and
[50:22.080 --> 50:28.160]  Jose Socrates attended the 2004 meeting in Stressa Italy before both going on to
[50:28.160 --> 50:32.000]  become Prime Minister of Portugal several key geopolitical decisions were
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.720]  made at last year's Bilderberg meeting in Washington DC again emphasizing the
[50:36.720 --> 50:41.520]  fact that the confab is far more than informal get-together as we reported at
[50:41.520 --> 50:46.120]  the time Bilderberg were concerned the price of oil was accelerating too fast
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.360]  after $150 a barrel and wanted to ensure that oil prices would probably be
[50:50.360 --> 50:53.760]  beginning to decline yeah I forgot we reported that even before Lindsey
[50:53.760 --> 50:58.280]  Williams did I forgot that from Bilderberg in general we reported that I
[50:58.280 --> 51:03.000]  forget all the stuff we report Americans do you know where your food comes from

[54:23.240 --> 54:30.960]  all right I was rampaging through this Bilderberg article as we reported at the
[54:30.960 --> 54:37.840]  time prisonplanet.com you make these connections that's right I forget
[54:37.840 --> 54:42.840]  everything we get from inside Bilderberg when I was up there in DC I remember how
[54:42.840 --> 54:47.400]  crazy the news sounded when I went on air and said Bilderberg thinks gas prices
[54:47.400 --> 54:54.120]  are too high they're going to plunge them to bankrupt Venezuela my gosh we
[54:54.120 --> 54:59.880]  reported that before Lindsay Williams and then a month later he called us and
[54:59.880 --> 55:03.480]  said he was told the same thing by his source which no doubt got it from
[55:03.480 --> 55:09.680]  Bilderberg see we don't we underestimate the amount of stuff we break like it's
[55:09.680 --> 55:13.480]  making the rounds now myself on March 5th start of the show saying they're
[55:13.480 --> 55:18.280]  gonna launch a fake swine flu attack as a beta test for the real one I just get
[55:18.280 --> 55:22.800]  all these pieces together and understand the enemy to such a level I'm not
[55:22.800 --> 55:25.480]  bragging it's just if you immerse yourself in something and have a good
[55:25.480 --> 55:31.480]  brain and have all these experts in different fields you talk to you but
[55:31.480 --> 55:40.000]  then we're not good at at crowing our own successes because we just put the
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.400]  info out and move forward just like I told you they were gonna have military
[55:45.400 --> 55:50.640]  drills with the military out helping a drunk driving checkpoints for PR
[55:50.640 --> 55:56.400]  purposes because I know how they operate I know drunk driving is their
[55:56.400 --> 55:59.720]  excuse to set up a police state and to end to get rid of the Bill of Rights
[55:59.720 --> 56:02.920]  already so I can understand they would do that I've been saying that for years
[56:02.920 --> 56:06.520]  and then what does the army announce a few months ago we're gonna help it DWI
[56:06.520 --> 56:10.800]  checkpoints and so are the Marines you're not for drunks are you I just
[56:10.800 --> 56:15.160]  understand these people and I'm telling you they're hard core and they mean
[56:15.160 --> 56:20.160]  business we ought to do a big to our own horn article because I'm looking right
[56:20.160 --> 56:24.000]  here at the prison planet dot-com article that we did back in early June
[56:24.000 --> 56:31.080]  months before I guess a month plus before when Lindsey Williams went public
[56:32.240 --> 56:35.800]  that didn't take away from Lindsey's contact with the former head of a major
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.560]  oil company they worked with telling him all this I just can't keep track of all
[56:40.560 --> 56:43.800]  the powerful info we put out here ladies and gentlemen that's up to you out there
[56:43.800 --> 56:51.080]  because we're a small operation as reported at the time Bilderberg were
[56:51.080 --> 56:55.960]  concerned the price of oil was accelerating too fast it had a hundred
[56:55.960 --> 57:00.160]  dollars a barrel and wanted to ensure that oil prices would probably begin to
[57:00.160 --> 57:05.040]  decline this is exactly what happened no matter how 2008 is oil again something
[57:05.040 --> 57:09.000]  low fifty dollars a barrel we were literally able to predict the rapid
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.600]  rise of oil in 2005 when oil was at forty dollars because Bilderberg had
[57:12.600 --> 57:16.080]  called for prices to rise during the year's meeting in Munich 250 I would
[57:16.080 --> 57:18.880]  add during the conference in Germany Henry Kissinger told his fellow
[57:18.880 --> 57:23.560]  attendees that the elite would resolve to ensure that oil prices would double
[57:23.560 --> 57:29.440]  over the course of the next 1224 months which is exactly what happened there is
[57:29.440 --> 57:39.360]  more to that report up on up on prison planet dot com right now in Paul Watson's
[57:39.360 --> 57:42.280]  article if you want to read the other key information but guys do me a favor

[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:06.160]  office and kill them because I know somebody who worked inside PETA and
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:14.600]  saw it and couldn't be part of it and quit but now it's mainstream news so we'll

[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:29.480]  Texas City Council member who was arrested by the mayor for speaking out

[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:39.640]  illegal a Texas State Court ruled it was illegal a few months ago the way they
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:44.480]  administer them they don't care I had the awesome police chief in the studio and
[1:01:44.480 --> 1:01:48.800]  I said Texas courts ruled your cameras are illegal doesn't have the right
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:55.720]  licenses doesn't have the private detective license didn't follow the
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:02:02.160]  regulations it's illegal he said I say it's not I'll tell you man this is
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:09.160]  gangster government ladies and gentlemen and that's what it is gangster
[1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:16.600]  government thug government that's what this society is a bunch of rogues doing
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:20.000]  whatever they want whenever they want and they've been doing it so long they
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:25.720]  think it's normal they think it's funny they think it's completely above board
[1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:29.240]  all right I'm gonna try to focus we'll cover Bilderberg next hour I want to
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:38.240]  open the phones up in this hour 1-800-2599231 1-800-2599231 but here's
[1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:43.360]  the issue when we come back I'm just gonna spend five minutes on it and to
[1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:49.320]  tail it and then move on I want to get your take on it they've got hate crime
[1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:52.280]  laws introduced that will ban free speech in the United States I mean
[1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:57.240]  openly ban it with felonies they're not just gonna shut your website down
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:03:00.480]  they're not just gonna shut your speech down they're gonna charge you with a
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:06.320]  federal felony and they're pushing in on national news right now with these you
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:12.160]  know heart tugging pulling on the heart strings examples and I got the bill
[1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:16.840]  number I got it all meanwhile there's a treaty little effectively in the Second
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:21.340]  Amendment that's not Alex Jones saying it that's CNN I have read most of the
[1:03:21.340 --> 1:03:24.880]  treaty interpreted as banning reloading as terrorism and restricting being able
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:29.960]  to clean or disassemble your firearms and selling guns in or out of the country
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:35.680]  and going after gun shows it's it's it's got a bunch of that and if you don't
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:39.080]  think treaties govern things look how NAFTA and GATT governs everything look
[1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:42.520]  at how we can't spend the money domestically with the stimulus package
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:48.720]  it has to be given to foreign companies who are got big banks backing them up
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:54.200]  unfairly because you you know you can't restrict the bids to US companies not
[1:03:54.200 --> 1:04:00.400]  that they exist anyway and you know I mean that's what treaties do but there
[1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:04.600]  are so many examples of free speech being trampled and annihilated and just
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:09.800]  ripped into pieces rendered down into slag heaps that I'll try to go over the
[1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:13.440]  latest developments give you this bill number when we get back and cover it but
[1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:18.680]  I do want to encourage everybody they're censoring us all over YouTube Google all
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:25.080]  over other video sites I mean there is a culling an extermination a terminator
[1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:31.480]  operation the best way to describe it is a purge against my videos and my
[1:04:31.480 --> 1:04:34.880]  material on the web because the establishment has got hit pieces coming
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:39.960]  out against us we got hack attacks ongoing against us we got all sorts of
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:44.480]  harassment going on against us I mean it is like we jumped in front of a train
[1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:48.760]  because we are hitting them hard we're saying arrest the bankers bypass the
[1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:52.600]  puppet republicans and democrats the bankers are illegitimate their takeover
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:56.720]  of our country's illegitimate this is criminal this is nothing but a
[1:04:56.720 --> 1:05:02.520]  situation of crime and they don't like that finally in the news this evening
[1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:06.400]  it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now
[1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:10.520]  penetrated our power grid even as energy experts are reporting that each
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:14.560]  summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid some
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:18.240]  say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the
[1:05:18.240 --> 1:05:23.040]  grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:27.880]  us all in the dark are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:31.920]  or government created blackouts have you ever thought about taking steps to get
[1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:36.760]  off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power if so
[1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:40.640]  this will be the most important information you have ever heard solar

[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:58.160]  you it's illegal in the birthplace of the Magna Carta but they set the precedent
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:02.960]  with groups that are politically incorrect that most people say okay fine

[1:13:55.400 --> 1:14:00.200]  descending over Europe descending over Canada descending over England and yes

[1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.640]  the analogy or the parallel the parable of Native Americans when Westerners
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:16.560]  arrive who had forms of flu and smallpox and syphilis and hepatitis that
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:19.760]  they'd never come in contact with and something that would just make a
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:25.240]  Westerners sick killed the Indians killed 90% of them conservatively that came in
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:31.560]  contact with it wiped them out well Americans aren't as accustomed to having
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:35.120]  their free speech taken in secret police and military checkpoints and that's why
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:38.560]  it's starting to happen and people first and all Alex it isn't happening now
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:42.400]  it's happening they go comment on our stories and they email me going oh so

[1:21:30.080 --> 1:21:33.840]  with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however an
[1:21:33.840 --> 1:21:37.520]  increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:41.280]  inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I recommend a
[1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:45.720]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and
[1:21:45.720 --> 1:21:50.440]  silver while paper investments currently have been driven by debt gold on its own

[1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:18.600]  so they've got multiple bills introduced to restrict free speech with felony
[1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:22.320]  federal charges if somebody says it hurt their feelings it actually says that
[1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:27.640]  that's what the Soviets did that's what Europe's doing this is the model they're
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:32.280]  following the same system and I've noticed we posted an article about record
[1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:37.360]  gun sales sales have even increased from what they were the previous record a few
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:42.160]  months ago after Obama won election those people knew his voting record total
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:46.520]  gun ban in Illinois what he voted for total gun ban in DC so does attorney
[1:24:46.520 --> 1:24:50.880]  general supports for nationwide banning he says on record and federal briefs he
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:55.280]  believes no citizen should be able to own any firearm even for hunting period
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:25:02.120]  and then now they've introduced a treaty and CNN's reporting it would ban guns
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:07.200]  the way the language is written and so folks are freaking out and so we were we
[1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:11.520]  write an article about that and the first comment is you're a liar fearmonger
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:16.200]  this isn't true there is no legislation when there's a bunch of gun
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:21.800]  restricting bills HR 45 and others introduced and I noticed almost every
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:26.240]  first comment on info wars in prison plan it's hard to get first comment is the
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:30.040]  same sounding people just saying this article is a complete lie none of it's
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:37.760]  true I mean we posted a article well Kurt wrote an article about how
[1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:46.560]  Bilderberg group and CFR and others but but mainly CFR has Google CEOs and
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:49.920]  people at the very highest level of the council and farm relations that's put out
[1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:55.320]  public paper saying restrict internet freedom and the CFR exist you know the
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:26:00.240]  global issues to deny the CFR even exist that's how insulting they were to the
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:03.680]  public that's how dumb they thought you were but now they decided they can't
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:08.000]  hide it so you see them all over the news now it's CFR doesn't exist to oh yes
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:16.920]  the CFR that's all you see on TV is this is a CFR this CFR that and the first
[1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:20.600]  comment on there is this is a complete lie I don't believe it Google isn't
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:25.960]  involved with the CFR that person knows that's not true the articles linked
[1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:32.640]  directly to the CFR but they don't care they're there they're paid to lie we
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:36.520]  have paid bloggers attacking us we've tracked their IP addresses it goes right
[1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:40.280]  back to government IPs and they're in there with lots of different fake names
[1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:44.960]  and we've caught government IPs they don't even hide their IPs folks they'll
[1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:49.520]  go look at that nice polo shirt Alex is wearing on TV they try to create class
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:57.080]  warfare like I'm wearing some $20 polo t-shirt and I'm rich if they know how
[1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:01.280]  to play on people's minds and we see that in the Bilderberg latest Bilderberg
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:05.480]  leak stuff you know hey talk about how people fighting the European Union
[1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:09.760]  work for rich people and foreigners and talk about how they're making money off
[1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:14.960]  this see that's in the article we've got the Paul Watson wrote today that's how
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:20.960]  they counter us look at all the Alex Jones making money off this and you see
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:25.520]  I'm posting it everywhere everywhere everywhere it isn't effective though
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:29.440]  people you know I'm not the government coming and taking your tax money and
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:33.040]  then giving it to foreign offshore banks see what are the bakers going to do
[1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:38.280]  they've stolen 14 plus trillion in seven months they bankrupted everything by
[1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:41.400]  design they're bringing us into this world tyranny and they're trying to pass
[1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:45.320]  laws restrict our speech and then we're here desperately trying to get the funds
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:53.680]  to fund this operation and they're all over the place with their talking points
[1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:56.920]  and by the way that came out and Cointel probe talking points and that came
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:00.920]  out in the violent radicalization act talking points talk about how these
[1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:06.440]  alternative media is just doing this for money this is a talking point and then
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:13.360]  we have it directly from Bilderberg as a talking point you understand when you
[1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:18.160]  see that that is a paid talking point now they're weak-minded fools that pick it
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:24.240]  up and parent it sure you know I'm not here making anybody give me their money
[1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:27.600]  and absolutely I like living in a decent house and driving a decent car and
[1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:31.920]  and having socks that don't have holes in them but I don't care I'm not into
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:36.720]  trappings and trinkets and crap I put the money back into this operation and
[1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:41.280]  fight the new order I'm not risking my life for bobbles and crud maybe it's
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:48.280]  because I grew up with bobbles and crud you know middle-class but the issue here
[1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:53.640]  is I'm proud of what we do I'm proud of the fact I put my films out for free and
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:58.920]  the enemy hates that they're the ones that take your money I was looking into
[1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:02.320]  the history of Google and I already knew the history but I wanted to double
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:06.920]  check it last night funded by Stanford funded by the government Defense
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:10.480]  Department money NASA money it's a government front you really think those

[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:30.880]  their head having to step down yesterday saying black people aren't humans
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:36.160]  that's who runs things not the stupid twits in their 777 flying around like
[1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:42.400]  rock stars this is a war with hardcore people and their talking point is how

[1:33:21.480 --> 1:33:40.400]  I was in the coffee room where we drink deeply from the coffee pot my final
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:49.720]  vice I have left and was watching CNN and they got a new statement out by Jackie
[1:33:49.720 --> 1:33:55.440]  Smith the home secretary Nazi over in England she is a Nazi literally that's
[1:33:55.440 --> 1:33:59.720]  Nazis restrict free speech that's one of their favorite things Soviet a pole
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:06.360]  pot us whatever you want to call her a Maoist whatever any tyrant history she
[1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:11.280]  certainly aligned with them very closely she said look we stand by banning
[1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:15.800]  Michael Savage for criticizing immigrants because anything that could make
[1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:19.880]  someone think about doing something violent see that's how this works that's
[1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:23.280]  why they're trying to pass all these hate speech laws they say oh well yes
[1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:27.800]  previously you couldn't say kill someone unless you're Michael Reagan he could
[1:34:27.800 --> 1:34:31.360]  then say kill mark dice call me I'll pay for the bullets I want you to gun him
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:36.200]  down I want you to murder him and then mark dice put the clip up and had his
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:41.120]  YouTube account suspended you gotta love that free speech you can't say this
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:46.600]  person's calling for my murder here's a 22nd clip no you're you're not allowed
[1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:52.360]  to show the crime that's a race and then they suspend his channel that's how
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:56.520]  YouTube rolls that's how YouTube operates that's who they are that's what
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:34:58.760]  they are
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:18.320]  no in fact when the establishment says kill us it's okay but when you say I
[1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:21.480]  don't think our border should be wide open our culture is being destroyed it's
[1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:24.600]  bankrupting our economy because the socialist government's putting all
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:27.960]  these foreigners on welfare we can't pay for this that's basically what Savage
[1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:33.000]  says oh my gosh you are banned because you could incite racial tension or
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:40.760]  violence it could incite you know maybe if I in fact I heard a talk show host
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:48.280]  Sunday as I was driving home talk about a black guy walking up in Florida to
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:52.160]  somebody who had a rebel flag on his head outside a convenience store and he
[1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:56.120]  shot the guy and the guys in critical condition and the black talk show host
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:36:00.880]  said well look brothers aren't putting up with this anymore and and basically
[1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:07.720]  defended it like like yeah we're getting I mean what on earth is that see
[1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:12.200]  that's the attitude well that rebel flag was inciting me so I had to shoot
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:16.640]  him when a rebel flag has nothing to do with slavery the war wasn't about that
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:19.600]  anyone who knows history knows that didn't become an issue to the last year
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:23.480]  of the war all of Lincoln's quotes it was about who would control Western
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:27.400]  expansion it was about tariffs and trade and northern tariffs on the southern
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:31.520]  goods being shipped out to Europe I mean that's the mainline history they
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:35.400]  almost had one of the 1830s when Andrew Jackson was president but because he was
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:42.080]  from a southerner from South Carolina and Tennessee he was able to stop it it
[1:36:42.080 --> 1:36:47.240]  had nothing to do with it it is a heritage issue believe me I know folks
[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:51.200]  we know I'm from Texas where it's not really rebel flag country even though
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:54.960]  that Texas was involved on the rebel side and I had a lot of ancestors who
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:37:03.440]  were in the Confederacy the issue is is that I know what that flag means to 99
[1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:07.320]  percent of people yet as a Ku Klux Klan run around with with rebel flags well
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:14.600]  yes so does they run around with American flags I was at the gym this
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:18.160]  weekend and they had a bulletin board somebody drawn a Viking on it and I
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:23.800]  almost went over and drew a life rune on a rune on it and I said all better not
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:27.040]  do that because the Nazis have expropriated that and then somebody
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:29.880]  will have me on video camera and here in the gym and it'll be on the news
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:34.880]  Alex Jones drawing Nazi symbols because everything is expropriated by
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:40.880]  different groups in the public is ignorant it's amazing and every time I
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:48.000]  say spook on air that is what they call CIA spies that's what they call spies
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:54.200]  you know they call it the spookworks I get emails going how dare you use a
[1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:57.520]  racial term I didn't even know that was to some people a racial term that's
[1:37:57.520 --> 1:38:01.520]  like when I say Kool-Aid I go yeah the Bush supporters have drunk the Kool-Aid
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:04.640]  meaning Jim Jones and then I get emails every time I say Obama supporters drink
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:08.480]  Kool-Aid they go you're being racist black people drink Kool-Aid well I
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:12.920]  didn't know that just black people drank Kool-Aid see all this multiculturalism
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:16.600]  I always talk to college students everyone's happened to me they teach you
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:21.280]  race in college and school now we're gonna teach you every racist term and
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:24.680]  slur and teach you about your differences all day long instead of you
[1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:29.120]  just getting along with each other it is these multiculturalists that pimp all
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:34.080]  of this stuff out and now they've trained everybody good if they say
[1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:41.280]  racist you're supposed to fall down and worship them and apologize number one
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:47.040]  Barack Obama's a puppet and runs nothing and is nothing just like George Bush and
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:56.440]  I refuse to play your stupid little games of race and politics and Republican
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:00.920]  and Democrat I refuse I refuse to be part of it all the groups that want to
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:06.280]  bash Jews or Catholics or Christians or Muslims or we all the global bankers
[1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:09.800]  set up on top of us playing all the groups off against each other I stay out
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:14.440]  of it but there are hundreds of comments a day hundreds of emails a day I'm not
[1:39:14.440 --> 1:39:17.720]  exaggerating saying you're a racist you don't like Barack Obama you're a race
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:23.160]  I mean you people are idiots and you think that's some effective a political
[1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:26.320]  thing you're doing and I guess it is effective because you seem to be you
[1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:30.760]  know getting ahead with it support our policies to be taken over by foreign
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:34.080]  banks or you don't like black people you know what does the UN say give us
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:37.960]  trillions of dollars more or Africans will starve meanwhile the UN's injecting
[1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:41.320]  them with all these different chemicals and biologicals in the vaccines and
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:45.800]  killing them that are in the hammer and every liberal you scratch the skin of is
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:50.680]  actually a racist eugenicist you know that's the big issue here not all these
[1:39:50.680 --> 1:39:57.600]  distractions but meanwhile and then I'm gonna go to your phone calls meanwhile
[1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:03.520]  is your blog a weapon is one of the articles and it links to the bill I have
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:07.080]  the bill here in front of me HR one nine six six it says if something hurts
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:18.200]  someone's feelings or something might stir someone push someone to engage in
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:21.440]  violence that's what the home secretary sings you sing well you don't have to
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:26.040]  call for violence or anything but if what you're saying upsets people then it
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:29.400]  might cause violence so you see now you're you're free to say anything that
[1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:32.480]  doesn't upset people and the churches are free to say anything that's not
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:36.720]  political because they're now under 501c3 and under government regulation of
[1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:39.760]  their speech see first it's don't endorse a political candidate oh and now
[1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:43.320]  don't say anything about politics and now the preachers tell their members at
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:47.080]  lunch if it's a church lunch don't talk about politics when you're having lunch
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:53.920]  see we're all being bathed in tyranny taught how to not have free speech now
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:03.080]  so it goes on and on and on and they've got hate bills introduced you name it
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:08.960]  this is what Smith says the witch this is a witch she wants to shut down your
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:12.040]  speech so they can have their way with you there's no doubt that England's
[1:41:12.040 --> 1:41:16.840]  going into serious tyranny I mean of the most virulent type I mean arresting
[1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:20.880]  people death camp level that's the architecture of what they've built it's
[1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:23.720]  like you're they're marching us up to a guillotine and people are saying gee I
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:28.600]  wonder what that's for and I'm saying well that's a guillotine so I can see a
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:32.160]  dump truck I wonder what that big yellow dump trucks for oh they put aggregates
[1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:37.040]  different you know rock and stone and asphalt and sand the back my gosh how
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:43.200]  do you know that I mean this is the exact it's like if you see in a football
[1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:47.840]  game they go into the shotgun formation you know what they're about to do I mean
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:57.000]  this is he's laughing at me again when we talk about Joe Madden it's joke
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:06.920]  listeners I know it's John Madden it goes on here it says
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.480]  this is someone who has fallen into the category of fomenting hatred of such
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:18.280]  extreme views and expressing them in such a way that it is actually likely to
[1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:22.000]  cause intercommunity tension or even violence if that person were allowed
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:27.520]  into the country yes if Michael Savage the little midget old man was allowed
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:30.920]  of the country everybody would just start murdering each other but see this
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:34.480]  is what they're now proposing in the US if something could hurt someone's
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:37.800]  feelings it's illegal and again whatever you see them doing in public
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:40.400]  school is what they're gonna do later and most the private schools are under
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:44.840]  the same federal accreditation so they're the same there's no free speech
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:47.200]  in schools there's no fourth amendment there's no fifth amendment that you know
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:50.640]  you're searched you thumbprint to get your school lunch you're a slave you're a
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:54.040]  prisoner you're you write dossiers on your parents you're taught how to tattle
[1:42:54.040 --> 1:42:58.440]  and the local Austin police putting ads on for kids to tattle on their parents
[1:42:58.440 --> 1:43:05.080]  it's in my film road to tyranny they put ads on local TV where I live to to get
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:10.040]  $200 if you report on your parents I mean ladies and gentlemen this is
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:15.480]  tyranny and it's going on nationwide so there now there is her quotes now
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:19.520]  there's six names it won't be listed I wonder who those names are probably I'm
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:25.880]  I bet I'm on there they really hate my guts over there you would have thought I
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:28.840]  was an 800 foot Cyclops when I was walking down the streets of London to the
[1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:33.040]  police I mean they're just scared to death anybody with a camera anybody that
[1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:36.800]  can string a sentence together I would show British citizens the cameras all
[1:43:36.800 --> 1:43:40.200]  around them and they'd say I don't see them that's a famous clip in a terror
[1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:44.360]  storm the guy says I don't see that camera he smiles and see he's that was
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:48.240]  it the guy was intelligent he was engaging in crime stop and double think
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:51.480]  effect you guys search engine the definition of crime stop I want to
[1:43:51.480 --> 1:43:57.920]  give him the exact or well definition of double think and crime stop any crime
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:00.960]  stopped he said I don't see those cameras they don't exist he laughed I said
[1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:05.720]  they don't exist yeah I choose not to see them that is the essence of cowardice
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:11.120]  the essence of subservience the essence of capitulation to tyranny well I'm not
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:14.520]  doing it not declare independence against this tyranny Jim Tucker's coming up
[1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:20.160]  and your calls I've been holding folks but I'm on a roll here today now let me
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:25.240]  say this the latest Bilderberg group leak and Esteline is with family on a
[1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:28.120]  family trip right now he will be on Monday with exclusive info for you here
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:34.520]  Monday's coming up in three four days what is it saying in here how the
[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:40.080]  Bilderberg group is going after and demonizing anti EU leadership in Ireland
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:44.240]  other places they say put out news reports about how they're making money
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:48.640]  the anti EU group is making money off this that's good for the commoners
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:52.520]  that's good for the fishmongers down the streets you'll play class warfare with
[1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:56.440]  them what is the big super banks do they play the poor people off against the
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:45:01.120]  middle class that it's always the same folks the globalists are weak they're a
[1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:06.000]  small group of people so they got to play them off so oh these politicians and
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.560]  community leaders that don't want to give up their country sovereignty and be
[1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:15.520]  taxed by the European Union they want money they're getting rich off of it
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:20.840]  same stuff they put out on us when I put my videos out for free when I put them
[1:45:20.840 --> 1:45:24.400]  out on the web for free when we make a fraction of the capital we would because
[1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:30.040]  of it I still do it because I want to win I want to beat the tyrants I know
[1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:35.320]  I'm in the right I passionately care about what I'm doing I am a pure soul when
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:39.320]  it comes to this fight I'm a pure soul I'm certainly a pure soul and every
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:45.520]  other issue I got desires of the flesh as they say let me tell you whether it's
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:53.640]  a giant plate enchiladas or other things Lord knows Lord knows I'm a dirty dog
[1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:57.800]  but the point here is is that and when it comes to fighting tyranny and fighting
[1:45:57.800 --> 1:46:02.880]  bullies I am pure of heart my motives are pure as the driven snow and I'm proud
[1:46:02.880 --> 1:46:07.960]  of who I am and I love all the attacks again I love that clip and network when
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:14.160]  the old news editor comes in and says to the new corporate guy he says if you
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:17.400]  put Howard Beale on the air I'm gonna go to all the papers and TV I'm gonna make
[1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:22.440]  a big stink in this town and he goes good we need the publicity it was much as
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:25.800]  you can now get out of here you're fired you're not out by noon I'll have you
[1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:30.360]  thrown out gotta find that clip networks around here somewhere in the office so
[1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:36.000]  at a base level I love being attacked because for Alex Jones's success and
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  Alex Jones is overall getting the word out because people are attacking me who
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.840]  who do this just their ego a lot of them because I'm in pole position and they
[1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:49.080]  can't stand it but it's sick and evil that I get off on being attacked because
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:53.080]  overall it is damaging to the liberty and freedom movement and that's why the
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:58.760]  system doesn't they know attacking me as a figurehead will in some ways hurt the
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:04.640]  overall movement but me the individual it just makes me incredibly powerful you
[1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:08.600]  understand it makes limbaugh incredibly powerful to be attacked on oxy cotton and
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:13.040]  being caught without Viagra coming back from the third world and acting like a
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:17.440]  fool that hurts the Republican Party but it helps fresh limbaugh that he gets
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:21.600]  just gets bigger and bigger and bigger well it's the same with me it makes me
[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:27.200]  bigger and bigger and bigger even though they're fake attacks but it does do
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:31.600]  some damage overall the liberty movement so we see if I was so the evil side of
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:35.520]  me the worldly side the Machiavellian cold-blooded side goes oh this is great
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:39.680]  more attacks and it's actually a sick form of entertainment for me but I just
[1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:42.520]  don't have time to ever focus on it anymore even though I do enjoy it and
[1:47:42.520 --> 1:47:46.720]  really I enjoy it so much people can't imagine but that is an evil side of me
[1:47:46.720 --> 1:47:50.160]  because it actually gives me energy I'm like oh I'm tired today all my enemies
[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:54.040]  are attacking me I'm gonna go back out no I do a better radio show more
[1:47:54.040 --> 1:47:57.800]  information I feel better overall and I'm closer to God if I do it purely
[1:47:57.800 --> 1:48:08.200]  through love but I have to say that I you know want to fall back into going

[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:04.880]  Russians and the Chinese meanwhile you read Pentagon documents where they've
[1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:09.760]  launched cyber attacks against themselves the excuse is to hype up and run a
[1:55:09.760 --> 1:55:14.480]  false flag cyber attack which they've already done many small ones to then say
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:18.160]  oh look we're under attack we've got to take over the internet and that's
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:23.800]  exactly what a month and a half ago the head of cyber security said what did the
[1:55:23.800 --> 1:55:28.400]  head of cyber security say a month and a half ago that that Obama had appointed
[1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:32.320]  he said the Pentagon and NSA are taking over the internet it's no longer gonna
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:37.640]  be free I resign then the head of MI5 resigns and comes out and says we're
[1:55:37.640 --> 1:55:44.760]  setting up an Orwellian state here openly by the way do you guys find the
[1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:48.560]  definition to crime stop and double-think
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:55.640]  okay I don't I don't see it here oh here it is crime stop yeah crime stop is a
[1:55:55.640 --> 1:56:00.000]  new speak term taken from the novel 1984 by George Arwell it means to rid oneself
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.880]  of unwanted thoughts I thought to interfere with the ideology of the
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:07.640]  party this was a way a person avoids committing thought crime in the novel we
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:12.440]  hear about crime stop through the eyes of protagonist Winston Smith the mind
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:16.400]  should develop a blind spot whenever the dangerous thought presents itself the
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:21.800]  process should be automatic instinctive crime stop they call it in new speak he
[1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:27.880]  set to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presently presented himself
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:32.480]  with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ice is
[1:56:32.480 --> 1:56:37.440]  heavier than water and trained himself in not seeing or understanding the
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:41.960]  arguments that contradicted them and that's what we saw in England they would
[1:56:41.960 --> 1:56:45.560]  say I want to give up my liberty for freedom I do not see that camera I'd
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:48.360]  say there's a camera right there and he would laugh and say I choose not to see
[1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:53.560]  it and this is what the yuppies do this is what they all do this they love it's
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:59.440]  a giggling spirit of weakness and and and scum filledness I don't know how

[2:01:08.760 --> 2:01:14.160]  got a story up on prisonplanet.com from the latest news release put out by
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:20.040]  Daniel Estolin by Daniel Estolin coming on the show Monday and I was reminded
[2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:29.320]  that it was Jim Tucker back in 2008 when fuel was $149 at the time in June he
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:34.640]  said that they were gonna cut the price in half and everybody laughed at him to
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:37.800]  bankrupt Venezuela and other nations now Soros has come out and said they did
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:42.200]  just that Jim Tucker everybody was talking about Lindsay Williams Lindsay
[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:45.760]  Williams had this Atlantic richfield connection all this stuff and he did
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:49.440]  separately have that connection but we had already broken this in an article
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:54.000]  written at prisonplanet.com secret of Bilderberg agenda to microchip
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:58.440]  Americans leaked elitist want microchip Americans the name of fighting terrorism
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:02.040]  Europeans universally opposed to attack on Iran globalist for oil prices rising
[2:02:02.040 --> 2:02:10.200]  too quickly and you read the area here on page 2 and it has it all so I wanted
[2:02:10.200 --> 2:02:16.440]  to get Jim to go back to his memory a year ago remember when it was $149 a
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:21.960]  barrel it was 147 by then and now here we are at 40 something bucks a barrel and
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:26.120]  kind of give us any other tidbits because we kind of glazed over that when
[2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:29.720]  he said it at the time from his Bilderberg contacts Jim Tucker good to
[2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:35.240]  have you here with us it's always fun it's always fun my friend we're gonna
[2:02:35.240 --> 2:02:39.560]  break in a minute so you get a cigarette in two minutes okay okay okay good
[2:02:39.560 --> 2:02:43.040]  alright I'm literally this is the choo choo train we're talking to the real
[2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:50.320]  gumshoe Jim Tucker Jim Daniel Estlund Danny has come out with new
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:53.640]  information as you know and talk about that after the break but first go back
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:57.760]  to a year ago your Bilderberg contacts I guess you didn't to your horn about this
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:03.680]  140 something bucks now 40 bucks how what what's what precisely did they say
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:10.240]  well we were reported immediately that the Bilderberg people had said that we
[2:03:10.240 --> 2:03:13.760]  don't have to bring the price of all down they brought it up a few years
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:17.760]  earlier they brought it up not says have to bring it down cause we're afraid
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:23.760]  Joseph Sixpack would stick with his small car stick with the railroads or the
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:29.040]  public transportation unless they got the prices down quickly and they did not
[2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:35.280]  want to lose Joseph Sixpack on the highways so well as you said nobody
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:39.240]  believed it at the time and I'm not writing about wasn't writing any
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:43.760]  predictions I was simply writing what Bilderberg was going to try to do they
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:48.360]  normally succeed so as you said the price we reported immediately that the
[2:03:48.360 --> 2:03:52.520]  Bilderberg was going to try to bring down the price of all from the hundred
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:03:57.360]  forty nine almost hundred six dollars a barrel to $40 a barrel they got it down
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:01.760]  briefly below $40 but that started unfolded immediately with the right
[2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:08.280]  people in both in the Far East and in the United States saying the right
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:13.960]  things immediately after Bilderberg I mean so quickly it reminds me of when I
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:16.880]  think it's a trilateral Commission me in California some years ago where
[2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:24.840]  Bilderberg called the trilateral calls for a 10 cent hike in the federal
[2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:30.560]  gasoline tax in the United States and the following Tuesday after meeting with
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:36.720]  Hope on Monday the Washington editorial page called for a 10 cent hike in the
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:42.480]  price of the tax federal tax on gasoline okay Jim Tucker stay there we're gonna

[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:38.640]  all right we're back live a few news stories I didn't get to yesterday this is
[2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:44.400]  time stuff I don't get to London telegraph swine flu inflatable mortuaries
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:49.320]  and express funerals plan for flu pandemic it goes on to talk about
[2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:53.800]  giant incinerators to burn the dead bodies how they rolled all this out in
[2:08:53.800 --> 2:08:58.800]  the UK and the US saying we're ready for the pandemic all we've ever done is
[2:08:58.800 --> 2:09:02.360]  report the mass grave sites they've got ready for pandemics the mass
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:07.280]  incinerators we've read the executive orders we've read the news articles and
[2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:11.800]  Glenn Beck and popular mechanics write articles saying none of it exists we made
[2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:21.480]  it up well here's the London telegraph I mean I'm just another article I mean the
[2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:24.640]  whole point is this is all set up and they're ready for this that's all we're
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:29.400]  reporting but again what they do is straw men they'll go to one site where
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:33.400]  there isn't mass graves and say see it's all discredited that'd be like if I said
[2:09:33.400 --> 2:09:39.480]  dolphins don't exist people said okay we'll prove that so I took you to a
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:44.640]  middle of Kansas to a field of wheat and said look there's no dolphins here
[2:09:44.640 --> 2:09:51.120]  dolphins don't exist proof 100% that's what Glenn Beck and others do you can
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:55.040]  really trust me I'm gonna get to the bottom of these camps I I think they're
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:09:58.120]  real in a month later after all this hype they're not real it's a total fraud
[2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:01.920]  I just bought the mechanics let me take you to an Amtrak station that isn't a
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:06.600]  camp that some kooks had 15 years ago was and then discredit all the serious
[2:10:06.600 --> 2:10:14.880]  research documenting that okay going back to Jim Tucker Jim I would guess that
[2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:22.040]  you've seen Daniel Esselen's new report we've got it up at prisonplanet.com right
[2:10:22.040 --> 2:10:25.320]  now I've been trying to find my article I had it here they dropped so many
[2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:29.520]  articles on my desk it's buried somewhere where Bilderberg wants to
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:34.880]  engineer a depression feudalism to bankrupt the world economy so that they
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:38.360]  can bring in more control bring in a new bank of the world new global currencies
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:42.920]  but isn't this just a repeat of what they're always saying always doing always
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:48.880]  pushing always wanting well yes it's all part of their agenda but now they have
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:53.080]  whether it was manufactured or not a global economic crisis they're gonna
[2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:57.280]  exploit now I have great confidence in Daniel Esselen's work we've collaborated
[2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:01.400]  for years and years at Bilderberg meetings we pool our information well in
[2:11:01.400 --> 2:11:04.800]  Europe where there's a large number of reporters from major newspapers and
[2:11:04.800 --> 2:11:10.120]  outlets broadcast outlets attending we all meet every evening and pool our
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:15.200]  information we're not competitors we're collaborators and confirm each other's
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:20.800]  findings as far as possible and Danny has always been right and his
[2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:30.080]  information proceeds from the Polish prisonplanet account is consistent with
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:35.360]  and expands upon everything I've found out about tri letals with their common
[2:11:35.360 --> 2:11:44.240]  agenda in Tokyo in late April and in getting information on the Bilderberg
[2:11:44.240 --> 2:11:50.080]  agenda for this year we knew they were going to exploit it and he does expand
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:58.720]  on my earlier findings that Bilderberg would be exploiting the economic
[2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:07.280]  crisis in attempt to get everybody especially to these bad at battle
[2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:14.760]  Americans who believe in national sovereignty to agree to a sort of
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:20.040]  worldwide global Department of Treasury which of course be a big step towards
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:27.120]  world government which is a ultimate goal but we can take heart in fact that
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:32.800]  Bilderberg has been blocked so far in these attempts we could be proud of the
[2:12:32.800 --> 2:12:39.360]  fact that young Americans many of them wearing Ron Paul baseball caps
[2:12:39.360 --> 2:12:43.920]  turned out for these various rallies and they turned out at Bilderberg last year
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:49.000]  in Chantilly in large numbers and they're carrying the message back to
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:59.320]  educated older affluent and catch potato generation absolutely again your book
[2:12:59.320 --> 2:13:03.400]  Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary is an excellent chronicle of your 30 plus
[2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:06.360]  years covering and it is available I should add at the online bookstore of
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:14.840]  info wars.com or folks can call toll free to get it 888-25-33139 888-25-33139
[2:13:14.840 --> 2:13:21.080]  just full of photos and documents and articles and and all of the exploits of
[2:13:21.080 --> 2:13:26.240]  Bilderberg exposed by Jim Tucker. Now Jim Tucker, what new intel have you
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:32.000]  gotten since we talked a few weeks ago building up to the meeting in June in
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:36.960]  Greece? Break down the dates of that narrative. It actually said May. May, late
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:45.920]  May, that's right. Yeah, well I'll go to Greece next Monday by flight to... It's early May. Okay, I was wrong. Okay.
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:54.200]  May 14th, 17th, something like that. Okay. So I'll be going to fire to Athens, which is an
[2:13:54.200 --> 2:14:01.080]  extortable mini where the scene was crowned. Next Monday I'll be there Tuesday
[2:14:01.080 --> 2:14:06.760]  evening, an overnight flight from Dallas to a connection. I don't know how I got it in my
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:09.880]  head that it was in early June again. It's normally then or in late May. They're
[2:14:09.880 --> 2:14:14.320]  kind of having it early this year, aren't they? Well, it's not unprecedented. I remember they
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:17.920]  met I think it was in Munich about the first weekend in May one year, but that
[2:14:17.920 --> 2:14:23.760]  was early so I've never known them to meet. Early May is normally late May to
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:31.680]  mid-June, but this year May 14th, 17th. Okay Jim, well I want to get reports from
[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:36.000]  you there. I need to make sure my producer gets your hotel number. Are you
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:39.520]  gonna have a cell phone or should I get a hold of you also if I lose track of you
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:45.760]  through the newspaper? Yeah, you call the newspaper and I think our website has
[2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:52.920]  my complete itinerary on it. Okay, well when should I have my producer nail down
[2:14:52.920 --> 2:14:57.320]  times to have you report live for little 10-minute reports for us on that
[2:14:57.320 --> 2:15:06.320]  Thursday and Friday? Let's see, I guess maybe if you give me a call in a
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:12.800]  little immediate on Wednesday by that time I'll probably have contacts set up
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:23.480]  and quite often in recent years as the we've had good sources inside it would
[2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:30.000]  be tart and feathered and strung up if they were identified but they sometimes
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:35.720]  would call me by pre-arrangement on a secure telephone and other times we
[2:15:35.720 --> 2:15:40.880]  meet at obscure places and pretend we don't know each other. I'm reading
[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:45.600]  newspaper, he's reading newspaper and we're talking. So once I get a better
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:49.200]  handle on when I have to meet these people then we can figure out time for
[2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:54.480]  you and me to talk. Absolutely, just so long as we do get you on each day of
[2:15:54.480 --> 2:15:58.200]  it's even for 10 minutes to give us the latest intel because you'll hear it here
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:04.120]  first folks the information coming out of Bilderberg 98% of the time they're
[2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:09.840]  able to get their agenda through just like a couple years ago in 2007 Jim said
[2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:14.280]  George Bush is gonna come out and endorse manmade global warming and carbon
[2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:18.040]  taxes and everybody didn't believe it and two weeks later George Bush came out
[2:16:18.040 --> 2:16:23.320]  and embraced it and that was the Bilderberg that Governor Rick Perry
[2:16:23.320 --> 2:16:29.960]  treacherously illegally under the Logan Act was attending. Man, time flies
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:35.200]  already into May and they're meeting in May, meeting there in Greece. Jim any
[2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:40.400]  other intel ahead of this year you know concerning what they're planning and
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:48.800]  what's on there? Well as American Free Press readers know by now the Delta
[2:16:48.800 --> 2:16:55.320]  plan to exploit the so-called swine flu hoping to scare the drugs out of
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:17:02.080]  everybody and again although they seem to be peter out the swine flu
[2:17:02.080 --> 2:17:07.200]  thank goodness but they're hoping to use that as a vehicle to scare people into
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:13.000]  accepting the World Health Organization as a sort of a World Department of
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:18.040]  Health and Human Services again another major surrender of sovereignty of the
[2:17:18.040 --> 2:17:23.640]  part of all European and North American nations. In fact Jim they've been saying
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:26.160]  that they've been saying this is good for globalism good for the global
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:31.560]  community good to have the UN and control the regions. Yes, well in fact I said
[2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:35.720]  North America here but now that includes South America and of course through the
[2:17:35.720 --> 2:17:42.000]  Tri-Lateral Commission the Asian nations too including although not directly
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:48.480]  Red China. Now Jim final question and we'll check in with you one more time
[2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:50.800]  next week before you leave town and then once you're there we're very thankful
[2:17:50.800 --> 2:17:58.920]  for your time. Jim Tucker specifically Esterel is on record in in-game and in
[2:17:58.920 --> 2:18:03.160]  the Obama deception that he has two Bilderberg members that are contacts you
[2:18:03.160 --> 2:18:06.400]  say you go and meet with these people I know and the independent film channel
[2:18:06.400 --> 2:18:09.880]  crew was with you you were being followed you were being chased security
[2:18:09.880 --> 2:18:13.680]  services you had to go into bazaars and through alleyways to shake them to meet
[2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:18.280]  your contacts. Are you generally meeting I mean this is already out there but I'm
[2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:22.120]  curious do you have Bilderberg contacts or are your contacts the secret
[2:18:22.120 --> 2:18:29.200]  services? I can't go much further than that otherwise I'd implicate some very
[2:18:29.200 --> 2:18:33.200]  important people and lose their services. I can tell you that one of my favorite
[2:18:33.200 --> 2:18:39.040]  contacts especially good at finding out where they'll meet is someone who deals
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:44.320]  in international finance he enjoys it's helpful to him personally know what
[2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:48.120]  Bilderberg's up to because of his business he knows them well enough so
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:52.760]  they can have casual conversations with certain ones and determine the meeting
[2:18:52.760 --> 2:18:59.000]  place and the dates as he did this year and for several years in the past but
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:05.400]  again if I got closer to do the finding them it could blow the whole thing. In fact
[2:19:05.400 --> 2:19:10.480]  for a lot of years I would negotiate with sources of how much will I can
[2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:17.840]  describe them okay a man about 40 years old six feet tall 180 pounds whereas a
[2:19:17.840 --> 2:19:24.480]  business suit but then one of our readers who's retired law enforcement
[2:19:24.480 --> 2:19:29.200]  from knowledge of some light sent me a letter saying that Bilderberg pointed
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:34.040]  the backtrack is the way you describe your sources physically they can still
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:37.560]  nail the guy so we explain to the readers that we don't do that anymore
[2:19:37.560 --> 2:19:42.240]  you'll not know the sources a girl boy fat skinny young or old because I don't
[2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:45.680]  know exactly but I mean it's quite remarkable to know that there's two
[2:19:45.680 --> 2:19:49.600]  Bilderberg group members that don't like what it's doing out of 140 members or
[2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:55.240]  so that's not without those ladies thatcher tell you what Jim let's do one
[2:19:55.240 --> 2:19:58.600]  more segment stay there you got a four-minute break we'll come right back

[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:44.520]  serious Jim you were finishing up your point about Margaret Thatcher go ahead
[2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:53.320]  oh yes she attended one meeting of Bilderberg and never attended another
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:27:00.600]  one and I learned that Bilderberg had decided to punish her and that's gonna
[2:27:00.600 --> 2:27:08.360]  thrown out of the head of state of his prime minister of Britain she was a place
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:17.200]  of her party by some of the trapeze artist John Major and of course I forgot who
[2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:21.560]  it was with their own party who succeeded her as Prime Minister I had the
[2:27:21.560 --> 2:27:25.120]  pleasure of talking briefly with her at a reception in Washington a couple of
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:30.000]  years later and asked her about it and her response I quiz directly I can
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:33.440]  roughly paraphrase it now that she considered a tribute to be denounced
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:38.840]  by Bilderberg and spoke harshly of any head of state that surrender any
[2:27:38.840 --> 2:27:44.440]  sovereignty to international organization and she's very harsh in her
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:50.560]  condemnation of Bilderberg and for her I have a great deal of respect alright well
[2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:55.720]  Jim Tucker they're openly announcing world government all over the news
[2:27:55.720 --> 2:27:59.440]  saying it's the solution of the banking crisis a new global banking authority to
[2:27:59.440 --> 2:28:04.080]  set tax rates interest rates currency rates what is it like to have this 35
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:07.760]  year journey of exposing the new world order and now have them just admitting
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:14.960]  it everywhere and calling for bills like HR1966 that will charge you with a
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:21.200]  felony if something you say hurts someone's feelings they told us in law
[2:28:21.200 --> 2:28:27.560]  school that the court has no remedy for hurt feelings so that's why this
[2:28:27.560 --> 2:28:34.800]  callable hate crimes bill is such a monster it punishes you for the
[2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:39.560]  terms of the federal thought police lives on all the streets of America when
[2:28:39.560 --> 2:28:45.720]  every state harshly punishes violent crime now whether you beat up the old
[2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:50.840]  lady to because you want her money or also you hate fat people doesn't matter

[2:29:08.440 --> 2:29:12.360]  they're afraid to die they'd much rather be charged with a federal hate crimes
[2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:17.520]  law because federal hate crimes law does not allow capital punishment the state
[2:29:17.520 --> 2:29:22.960]  of Texas is gonna hang them absolutely and Jim just because you're a news

[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:38.600]  i have a couple more
[2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:40.040]  brief points but that uh...
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:44.880]  this obama deceptions the easiest to distribute film you've ever made
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:48.320]  and uh... i concur with them being evergreen because of
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:51.000]  i watched uh... america destroyed by design
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:52.440]  just recently
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:54.520]  but the two points i wanted to make was
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:56.640]  eleven a community
[2:34:56.640 --> 2:35:00.240]  everybody knows everybody's business in fact they even published
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:03.640]  traffic ticket speeding tickets things like that
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:05.000]  and uh...
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:06.200]  one of our uh...
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:09.500]  doctors gave his nineteen-year-old daughter of a vaccine
[2:35:09.500 --> 2:35:10.640]  barfield
[2:35:10.640 --> 2:35:13.640]  and she died
[2:35:13.640 --> 2:35:15.280]  well that's you know
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:18.160]  according to the fb i it's able to be alternative media though to point out
[2:35:18.160 --> 2:35:20.920]  mainstream news articles where all these kids are dying but
[2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:24.000]  again we're bad to point that out sir we should just admit the bankers robbing
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:25.880]  us are good and we're bad
[2:35:25.880 --> 2:35:30.000]  right also i wish this was a little more timely but going back to one
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:32.160]  print
[2:35:32.160 --> 2:35:34.560]  when obama went to uh... england
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:36.320]  for the g-20 meeting
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:38.640]  and he did all that bowing
[2:35:38.640 --> 2:35:41.320]  every uh... saint patrick's day
[2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:43.840]  uh... history channel plays uh...
[2:35:43.840 --> 2:35:45.920]  the irish in america
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:50.600]  and i think i've got my facts right but at the nineteen oh four olympics was
[2:35:50.600 --> 2:35:51.960]  held in uh...
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:53.320]  london
[2:35:53.320 --> 2:35:55.720]  and it's protocol that when
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:35:59.520]  in the opening ceremony when they go past the viewing station
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:02.720]  because of all families there that they did the flag
[2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:05.800]  and symbolic of bowing
[2:36:05.800 --> 2:36:07.320]  to the king
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:09.920]  well most of the uh...
[2:36:09.920 --> 2:36:13.440]  american team united states team was irish
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:16.280]  and one of them went up to the color bearer
[2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:18.920]  and told him if he dipped that flag
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:22.040]  that he'd spend that night in the hospital
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:23.720]  and to this day
[2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:26.320]  our flag is not dipped
[2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:29.040]  that's our president and when they called up
[2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:31.880]  when they had a
[2:36:31.880 --> 2:36:35.440]  talk with a spokesman he said the stars and stripes about to know
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:37.720]  earthly king
[2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:41.320]  well i know this uh... the bankers have taken over and
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:43.800]  they're still gonna allow us to have the flag
[2:36:43.800 --> 2:36:45.440]  as an image out there
[2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:49.960]  but what that image symbolizes changing to one of tyranny and it's very very sad
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:53.400]  so the spirit of the flags being basically possessed and taken over
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:55.680]  i appreciate your call to hear from you don
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:36:59.480]  tom in wisconsin tom you're on the air
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:04.760]  hi alex uh... again i think i think if everything you do because uh... you know
[2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:07.080]  we need uh... we need some guidance
[2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:08.640]  with what's going on now
[2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:11.920]  but uh... you know i don't think i give guidance i just i just cover all this
[2:37:11.920 --> 2:37:13.240]  crazy news i mean
[2:37:13.240 --> 2:37:15.120]  i get up here
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:19.400]  well and i know and i don't want a minute and i read a bill and i tell
[2:37:19.400 --> 2:37:22.480]  people it says right here little rest you somebody says you've heard their
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:23.920]  feelings
[2:37:23.920 --> 2:37:24.760]  go ahead
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:26.960]  it's annoying i i'm just saying that
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:31.760]  your analysis is what gives us guidance it's not it's not the event going on
[2:37:31.760 --> 2:37:35.000]  because you know we need somebody to that help digest what's going on if we're
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:36.480]  not informed
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:40.640]  but uh... i i am i'm on probation myself right now and i had to go
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:43.320]  get treatment for you know for my issue
[2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:45.360]  and um... i
[2:37:45.360 --> 2:37:49.520]  it can i have my final meeting with my counselor and i i literally
[2:37:49.520 --> 2:37:53.200]  i saw when i brought up that i have the two dogs in my house and they're not
[2:37:53.200 --> 2:37:56.520]  spayed or neutered and you know i don't believe in getting shots for my dog
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:37:58.800]  because i don't know what's in them
[2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:00.320]  and she really just
[2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:03.240]  sort of like all i i i i care for your dog and
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:07.080]  all my gosh you know it did that the females in he didn't all that's just so
[2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:09.800]  painful and it was just it hit me
[2:38:09.800 --> 2:38:13.440]  how how much of a priest class
[2:38:13.440 --> 2:38:16.800]  it is for the people like the way they think and and and the way they view the
[2:38:16.800 --> 2:38:17.920]  world it
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:20.080]  is she thought it was more cool
[2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:21.440]  for my dog
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:23.560]  to not be altered
[2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:26.480]  that would have been for them to be altered
[2:38:26.480 --> 2:38:29.240]  and i don't know these are control freaks
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:32.440]  and it sounds with something that sounds reasonable like spayed or neutered
[2:38:32.440 --> 2:38:33.720]  well that's your choice
[2:38:33.720 --> 2:38:37.000]  so there's not all these unwanted puppies and cats sounds reasonable but
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:38.960]  once the president said
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:42.800]  that she's going to control your life it's the nanny state
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:45.840]  and so at the low level it's all a bunch of well-meaning
[2:38:45.840 --> 2:38:50.560]  idiots and there's also just hardcore criminals that are you know in uniform
[2:38:50.560 --> 2:38:54.240]  but then above them are scientific dictators
[2:38:54.240 --> 2:38:58.040]  who understand what they're doing understand what they've set up
[2:38:58.040 --> 2:39:02.760]  and see if you look at the final thing that happened to before i left that just
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:05.960]  was shocking off for me because i was actually see it in real-time happened
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:07.000]  before me
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:10.120]  well the last thing she said was like you know i hope things go well for you
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:13.240]  hope you do okay you know hope things work out and i'm like well you know
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:16.600]  i'm really just worried about my survival and and i believe that things are
[2:39:16.600 --> 2:39:19.440]  going to get a lot darker before it gets better
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:23.000]  and she just looked like she was about to cry and she was like saying she just
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:26.680]  basically said to me like well you know we can all try to be as happy as we can
[2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:30.200]  be and and and what struck me about that statement was
[2:39:30.200 --> 2:39:33.160]  instead of acknowledging that things are getting bad instead of acknowledging
[2:39:33.160 --> 2:39:35.360]  the horrible things that are going on
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:38.760]  she just was like well i'm going to be as happy as i can be and and it's like if
[2:39:38.760 --> 2:39:41.120]  you're going to be happy and be delusional
[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:44.480]  you know that that doesn't help anybody even if you are in a position where
[2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:46.840]  you're supposed to help people it
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:49.880]  just try to coach me to be delusional about the rest of the world i hear you
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:39:52.080]  know i hear you and i appreciate your call
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:55.880]  uh... in fact if you read 1984 that is his experiences as a member of the
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:57.360]  secret police in india
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:40:01.520]  then as a communist fighter fighter against the nazis in spain
[2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:04.880]  then he finds out the nazis uh... and the communists are all controlled by the
[2:40:04.880 --> 2:40:05.800]  same people
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:09.320]  he works for british propaganda at the bbc
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:13.160]  uh... in wartime propaganda and then he writes 1984 and dies
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:17.000]  in there he is upstairs neighbor
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:20.520]  no matter how bad things are he makes excuses about how it's all about him
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:22.160]  just being happy mentally
[2:40:22.160 --> 2:40:24.960]  and how great it is that his kids are little government spies
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:26.800]  and then when his kids denounce him
[2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:28.480]  and send him to the torture camp
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:30.040]  he thanks them
[2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:33.960]  and says yes it's true i deserve it i must have done something i didn't know i
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:35.220]  did
[2:40:35.220 --> 2:40:39.680]  and that's what they do it's double think it's uh... triple think it's crime stop
[2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:41.000]  it's double speak
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.080]  uh... they're living in la la land
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:44.400]  thank you uh... don

[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:03.120]  do
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:06.480]  uh... you're talking this morning about uh...
[2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:11.080]  uh... the first amendment and constitutional rights uh... abuse
[2:41:11.080 --> 2:41:14.160]  uh... i thought i would give you a call first time i've tried to call i
[2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:16.160]  thought i'd give you a comment
[2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:21.960]  and let you know about this one uh... back on three twenty four oh five
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:27.480]  our church was seized by the new jersey state police counterterrorism division
[2:41:27.480 --> 2:41:32.160]  uh... in uh... in in cooperation in correlation with the local sheriff's
[2:41:32.160 --> 2:41:33.400]  office
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:38.760]  uh... my wife and i were arrested on criminal charges
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:44.400]  and all that went down because we refused to to incorporate the church
[2:41:44.400 --> 2:41:49.520]  i also heard you talking earlier about that the five oh one c three and
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:51.480]  you know i don't know if your listeners are really
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:53.760]  cognitive of how
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:59.200]  how evil and despicable the whole process of incorporating a church really
[2:41:59.200 --> 2:41:59.960]  is
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:03.160]  or or understand the ramifications
[2:42:03.160 --> 2:42:06.040]  of incorporating a church
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:09.680]  if you are a pastor and you refuse to do that
[2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:14.680]  man they will put a target on you with it so big that that they will not miss
[2:42:14.680 --> 2:42:16.160]  they will not miss you
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:19.280]  uh... you know it took six years for them to
[2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:21.680]  uh... decide that they were going to
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:27.320]  uh... in complete absence of any lawful uh... reason for doing so
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:32.000]  to uh... to to just come in and and steamroller us over and that's exactly
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:33.320]  what they did
[2:42:33.320 --> 2:42:38.080]  and they did it with an incredible amazing show force
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:40.400]  they did it through intimidation
[2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:46.040]  uh... they did it through a long process of of systematic harassment
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:48.320]  and using the local press there
[2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:52.520]  who were cool cooperated with them who were more than happy to cooperate with
[2:42:52.520 --> 2:42:53.480]  them
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:54.560]  and uh...
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:42:58.840]  uh... when push came to shove they came in and they uh... and and they
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:43:00.520]  uh... they see the church
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:04.320]  uh... my wife and i'd uh... essentially lost everything that we ever
[2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:08.680]  spent after i don't know a a famous case of this was in an apple's Baptist
[2:43:08.680 --> 2:43:09.440]  temple
[2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:12.560]  one of the first actions of uh... then attorney general
[2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:14.540]  uh... john ashcroft
[2:43:14.540 --> 2:43:16.680]  and the church just said look
[2:43:16.680 --> 2:43:20.440]  we're not going to pay taxes to you congress shall make no law rest
[2:43:20.440 --> 2:43:22.120]  establishing uh...
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:24.260]  the exercise of religion
[2:43:24.260 --> 2:43:28.280]  respecting an establishment of religion for having the free exercise thereof
[2:43:28.280 --> 2:43:31.000]  and then they always advertise all the greedy church wanted money it's like
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:33.040]  televangelist the televangelist
[2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:36.240]  the government has been caught actually funding them a c i front that's
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:38.240]  mainstream news folks that don't know just
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:39.280]  search engine it
[2:43:39.280 --> 2:43:41.680]  it's it's the true independent churches
[2:43:41.680 --> 2:43:45.160]  could governments not supposed to be involved in churches they have
[2:43:45.160 --> 2:43:47.560]  no jurors diction
[2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:50.840]  and now they've gone from telling churches what they can and can't say
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:53.280]  to literally funding them and taking them over
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:55.260]  with the clergy response teams
[2:43:55.260 --> 2:43:59.520]  well see that was the whole basis on us establishing the church as a non
[2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:00.880]  incorporated
[2:44:00.880 --> 2:44:02.640]  non-consenting
[2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:06.620]  uh... church that was established in and under the uh...
[2:44:06.620 --> 2:44:10.520]  uh... actual and literal lordship of christ rather than the lordship of
[2:44:10.520 --> 2:44:11.520]  Caesar
[2:44:11.520 --> 2:44:15.160]  and that that's why they fought us to the nail as long as they did
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:17.500]  but when they finally sees the church we
[2:44:17.500 --> 2:44:21.440]  and you know this is three years ago but we've we've been the past
[2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:25.200]  uh... three years uh... putting together a uh...
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:28.520]  uh... three-hour two-part three-hour uh...
[2:44:28.520 --> 2:44:30.600]  documentary dvd
[2:44:30.600 --> 2:44:34.440]  uh... titled seized for refusing to incorporate the story of the church at
[2:44:34.440 --> 2:44:35.480]  Salem
[2:44:35.480 --> 2:44:40.000]  uh... which is posted on our website and that can i give our website out over
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:41.080]  the year ahead
[2:44:41.080 --> 2:44:44.360]  yeah it is double you double you double you dot
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:46.000]  dot church at

[2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:48.960]  dot info
[2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:52.080]  and i'm gonna let you go sir i'd appreciate your call
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:54.920]  uh... yeah this is the supposed freedom of this country
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:57.560]  congress shall make no law that i'm looking at uh... for my pocket
[2:44:57.560 --> 2:45:00.000]  constitution but other personal matter
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:02.440]  congress shall make no law respecting an
[2:45:02.440 --> 2:45:05.880]  establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[2:45:05.880 --> 2:45:08.720]  and until the nineteen fifties the government wasn't involved in anything
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:09.560]  with churches
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:11.720]  then they said oh
[2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:16.280]  we'd like you to fill out a form saying your tax exempt
[2:45:16.280 --> 2:45:19.640]  we'd like you to do that
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:22.240]  and
[2:45:22.240 --> 2:45:23.640]  it's just a formality
[2:45:23.640 --> 2:45:26.240]  and that the churches were so trusting they didn't know
[2:45:26.240 --> 2:45:30.880]  they were waving their rights going in now as a charity not a church
[2:45:30.880 --> 2:45:33.240]  just like there's no law to take vaccines
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:36.560]  but it's a policy
[2:45:36.560 --> 2:45:38.880]  and then if your child is in school
[2:45:38.880 --> 2:45:41.400]  they charge you with truancy
[2:45:41.400 --> 2:45:43.840]  and it's so obvious that the parents never noticed
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:48.040]  i'm being charged with truancy because they take my child out for not having
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:48.880]  shots
[2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:51.520]  but there's no long shots
[2:45:51.520 --> 2:45:53.880]  well to say that they need to sign a contract
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:57.160]  and now i've been sent the letters from catholic churches uh... protested
[2:45:57.160 --> 2:45:58.760]  churches all of them
[2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:00.040]  where they're telling him
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:01.840]  it is the law
[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:05.360]  uh... that no one be allowed to talk about politics not just the preacher not
[2:46:05.360 --> 2:46:06.680]  just the employees
[2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:09.880]  in the pews in sunday school in the parking lot
[2:46:09.880 --> 2:46:12.960]  and they hand out sheets uh... ramon teague's baptist church big one out in
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:15.200]  drifting springs
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:18.000]  secret but this is america this is total russia
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:20.920]  handed out sheets going you don't talk about elections
[2:46:20.920 --> 2:46:23.480]  anywhere you don't talk about it
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:26.120]  will lose our tax exemption the church will get shut down
[2:46:26.120 --> 2:46:28.920]  so see first it's all just fill out this form no big deal to now

[2:46:36.280 --> 2:46:38.680]  and then after the fear they come in and say hey with the government can be
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:39.960]  friends to
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:41.680]  we got free federal money
[2:46:41.680 --> 2:46:43.600]  billions a year
[2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:46.400]  and they just buy off the denominations heads

[2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:52.920]  federal funding going on every christian domination that's big out there
[2:46:52.920 --> 2:46:55.960]  it doesn't matter every major group look up your church group

[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:27.120]  sheet with the complaints we now fully know
[2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:33.680]  what shut down the website there was a complaint on the video neocon talk show
[2:54:33.680 --> 2:54:36.880]  host michael reagan wants to kill mark dice
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:41.040]  they got mark dice's channel banned for that you you play a clip of him saying
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:44.160]  murder 911 truthers i will pay for the bullets
[2:54:44.160 --> 2:54:50.000]  murder them i am contracting for murder and the police would do nothing they
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:52.640]  said we know he's allowed to call for your murder
[2:54:52.640 --> 2:54:55.760]  but we're going to ban criticizing open borders
[2:54:55.760 --> 2:55:01.120]  literally it's now happening uh that's how selectively this is enforced so
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:04.320]  clearly fair use calling for a murder mark die specifically
[2:55:04.320 --> 2:55:08.640]  that's what that was one of the because it takes three of these to do it
[2:55:08.640 --> 2:55:13.680]  and uh the other one uh youtube said was one of their issues and then the next
[2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:18.160]  one was alex this is the name of the video alex jones on 590 k lb j m i

[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:32.160]  and pittsburgh post gazette and uh youtube said that showing the news
[2:55:32.160 --> 2:55:36.000]  article that he uses a slide with the photo of the guy that was from his my
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:40.080]  space that that's what did it and it the claim is by
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:42.960]  p s company
[2:55:44.160 --> 2:55:47.920]  and youtube says that's the pittsburgh post gazette because that's all that's
[2:55:47.920 --> 2:55:52.560]  there is the pittsburgh post gazette that you know it's a slide show it's not
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:55.920]  we don't do that show i'm probably moving to the studio so we can go live on
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:55:59.680]  sundays with the video feed at prison planet dot tv as well for folks that
[2:55:59.680 --> 2:56:02.800]  are watching over there and that's in the works the next month or so the way we
[2:56:02.800 --> 2:56:07.280]  do it maybe 10 years from now but uh the point is
[2:56:07.280 --> 2:56:11.040]  or we're so busy doing all these other jobs folks and i'm so busy i'm not
[2:56:11.040 --> 2:56:14.800]  bitching i gotta take a vacation you know this happens a couple times a year
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:17.760]  where i've been doing like four or five radio shows a day on top of my own
[2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:21.360]  show and not getting sleep where my brain stops working
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:25.200]  and i start making a lot of mistakes and i have to take off a few days and so
[2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:28.480]  look for me to be off a few days coming up and jason bermas to be in here
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:33.360]  because even one or two days of me unplugging the computer staying away
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:37.520]  from the news camping or something can get me to
[2:56:37.520 --> 2:56:41.760]  untangle my brain because a lot of folks are saying oh it's the
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:47.200]  best shows ever but not mentally mentally i am just
[2:56:47.200 --> 2:56:51.760]  it feels like i got a lead weight on my back or something i i just i just can't
[2:56:51.760 --> 2:56:54.640]  i'm so sick of the new world and all their crap
[2:56:54.640 --> 2:56:59.760]  that i just can't focus on it for a couple days i'm gonna have to take off
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:02.640]  and this only happens a few times a year but i i've got to get out of here
[2:57:02.640 --> 2:57:12.800]  i've got to get out of here because uh
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:17.360]  i just feel very aggressive i feel very very aggressive
[2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:23.360]  and i'm sick of parasites and pimps and government thugs and all of it
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:27.280]  that's a nice way of saying it nice way of saying it
[2:57:27.280 --> 2:57:33.280]  i uh i can't believe my fellow man puts up with this type of crap i mean i can't
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:37.680]  believe that people would go along with all of this
[2:57:37.680 --> 2:57:45.680]  so mark dice in agreeing not to sue michael reagan
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:50.080]  they unsuspended his channel so we need to call mark dice
[2:57:50.080 --> 2:57:53.040]  and have him call michael reagan they're now buddies
[2:57:53.040 --> 2:57:56.880]  because reagan got scared of all this stuff and apologized on air and then
[2:57:56.880 --> 2:58:01.840]  took the copyright infringement notice off and that unsuspended mark dice's big
[2:58:01.840 --> 2:58:05.680]  account so now that i have this he dave the guy that
[2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:07.760]  runs the channel just told me about earlier now i have all the official
[2:58:07.760 --> 2:58:11.120]  documents we know who to go to pittsburgh poskazette's
[2:58:11.120 --> 2:58:16.400]  denying it saying they didn't do it i wondered if michael reagan will deny
[2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:20.720]  he did it um but uh because it's a big deal that

[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:25.600]  how you doing alex hey buddy good to talk to you listen
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:28.960]  i wanted to send something out to the people who are sitting on the fence but
[3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:32.400]  the new old order they're going back and forth with you or
[3:00:32.400 --> 3:00:35.520]  they don't really know what's going on or they don't even believe it
[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:40.800]  there is a quote by a french politician back in the 1850s i can't pronounce the
[3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:43.200]  name completely i'm sure it's wrong it's alexa
[3:00:43.200 --> 3:00:47.760]  to talk about something like that it's alexander to talk volume
[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:50.880]  yeah he said the american republic republic will endure
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:55.360]  until politicians realize they can bribe the people with their own money
[3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:59.200]  and these and our politicians just told us with the banks that they're going to
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:02.720]  take our tax dollars so the banks can loan us money
[3:01:02.720 --> 3:01:07.440]  i mean if people see the circular logic here that's going on this is for real
[3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:09.760]  you know those of you who are sitting on the fence
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:14.560]  this is no joke and i may touch on that analogy that you do with the frog about

[3:01:18.640 --> 3:01:22.240]  with the uh... these elites and you know with the boulderbergs and with the
[3:01:22.240 --> 3:01:25.280]  with all these all these families it's like a family tradition with these
[3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:28.160]  people it's easy analogy the two bulls that are
[3:01:28.160 --> 3:01:32.080]  standing on the hill the young bull said to the old bull hey let's run down
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:35.280]  there and screw a cow but the old bull said to the young

[3:01:47.920 --> 3:01:51.440]  pathetic and they're doing us a favor listening they're like sure pal sure
[3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:52.080]  buddy
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:55.200]  hey governments killed 200 million people last century

[3:08:27.040 --> 3:08:31.760]  guest spokesman for consumer freedom dot com and i happened to more than a
[3:08:31.760 --> 3:08:35.520]  decade ago get to know somebody who had briefly worked for peter but actually at
[3:08:35.520 --> 3:08:39.600]  their corporate office in norfolk virginia and she said it was the craziest
[3:08:39.600 --> 3:08:43.160]  thing that they would pressure the employees to go and i thought this
[3:08:43.160 --> 3:08:46.360]  person was kind of crazy at first i mean years later i found out she was
[3:08:46.360 --> 3:08:50.680]  telling me the truth i found it hard to believe but i knew them and knew they
[3:08:50.680 --> 3:08:55.760]  weren't liars and they said that peter would pressure them to go get animals
[3:08:55.760 --> 3:08:59.200]  from the local shelter claiming they were adopting them to then take them back
[3:08:59.200 --> 3:09:03.320]  and that they would you know that she learned they were getting off on and
[3:09:03.320 --> 3:09:06.280]  lethal injecting them and she said i'm here to help animals i'm not here to be
[3:09:06.280 --> 3:09:08.040]  part of this and left
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:12.280]  most people don't get a view in the inside trappings it was also stuff like
[3:09:12.280 --> 3:09:16.720]  close the doors we've got hamburgers double beef burgers and
[3:09:16.720 --> 3:09:18.360]  folks
[3:09:18.360 --> 3:09:20.760]  well i'm on record saying that over a decade ago and now it's become
[3:09:20.760 --> 3:09:22.680]  mainstream news the last few years
[3:09:22.680 --> 3:09:26.880]  they're crazy behavior so david uh... you you you've been a head up one of the
[3:09:26.880 --> 3:09:29.360]  groups that's been exposing these freaks
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:30.440]  uh...
[3:09:30.440 --> 3:09:32.320]  tell us about it
[3:09:32.320 --> 3:09:35.480]  well i you you've set up a really very well i'll have
[3:09:35.480 --> 3:09:36.680]  you know peter
[3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:40.760]  the people who tell us that we were not allowed to use or kill animals for any
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:43.920]  purpose including medical research to cure cancer
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:47.800]  i turned out there their views are so extreme that even they can't total line
[3:09:47.800 --> 3:09:51.480]  uh... we we've got some uh... through freedom of information act request in
[3:09:51.480 --> 3:09:52.320]  virginia
[3:09:52.320 --> 3:09:56.520]  we got hold of some state records that were filed by peter lawyers
[3:09:56.520 --> 3:10:00.760]  that showed just what happens to all the animals that they take in so supposedly
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:03.680]  for adoptive purposes
[3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:07.280]  it's pretty stunning uh... they wind up killing
[3:10:07.280 --> 3:10:09.520]  pretty much around ninety percent
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:12.280]  of all the animals they take in for adoption
[3:10:12.280 --> 3:10:14.160]  uh... you know last year
[3:10:14.160 --> 3:10:15.480]  two thousand eight
[3:10:15.480 --> 3:10:20.440]  uh... peter killed twenty one hundred and twenty four pets
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:24.880]  they found adoptive homes for exactly seven
[3:10:24.880 --> 3:10:28.800]  this is that the dirty little secret of the animal rights world is that peter
[3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:32.440]  kills animals and we actually have all these records up for the public to look
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:36.640]  at a website called perfectly enough peter kills animals dot com
[3:10:36.640 --> 3:10:39.720]  and you can actually see the reports filed by the state of virginia
[3:10:39.720 --> 3:10:42.080]  uh... peter based in norfolk so
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:44.120]  with a virginia law they're considered a humane
[3:10:44.120 --> 3:10:44.800]  society
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:47.840]  well for those three port they have to report this to the state every year
[3:10:47.840 --> 3:10:50.640]  well it's just like they're always catching cops that are involved in
[3:10:50.640 --> 3:10:54.000]  child pornography investigations trying to fly across the country to meet with a
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:55.120]  five-year-old
[3:10:55.120 --> 3:10:58.000]  uh... you know statistically it's the truancy officer on average you know
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:10:59.560]  that's the highest rate of that
[3:10:59.560 --> 3:11:01.120]  so same thing with peter
[3:11:01.120 --> 3:11:03.720]  at the higher echelons
[3:11:03.720 --> 3:11:07.800]  uh... i'll just go ahead and say it my wife was offered a lucrative book deal
[3:11:07.800 --> 3:11:11.200]  of fifty thousand dollars on the advance and turned it down because that's how i
[3:11:11.200 --> 3:11:13.000]  found out about it she was my girlfriend
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:14.680]  she was tracked down
[3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:16.680]  by a major publisher
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:19.680]  was uh... actually uh... i'm not gonna say the name of the publisher i think in
[3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:22.200]  the in the letter it was a confidentiality thing
[3:11:22.200 --> 3:11:25.040]  but the point is in she said no i'm scared of i'm not going to do it and i
[3:11:25.040 --> 3:11:27.000]  said yeah that's probably a good idea
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:29.400]  and of course i've been dating her a few years
[3:11:29.400 --> 3:11:32.600]  and i didn't hardly believe it when she was telling me because she just lived
[3:11:32.600 --> 3:11:33.800]  in virginia
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:37.800]  uh... one of her friends that she worked out with said hey do you want to come
[3:11:37.800 --> 3:11:38.800]  over here
[3:11:38.800 --> 3:11:42.360]  and uh... you know get a job and and and and it was like a cult
[3:11:42.360 --> 3:11:43.680]  she was only there a few months
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:47.520]  it was mainly people outside of it never knew what happened she happened to get
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:48.480]  right in
[3:11:48.480 --> 3:11:51.560]  to the inner circle and she said it was completely insane
[3:11:51.560 --> 3:11:54.680]  and you know and and and she left you know pretty fast
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:11:57.320]  and then she was telling me that they would pressure him to get animals and
[3:11:57.320 --> 3:11:59.040]  kill him she would never do that
[3:11:59.040 --> 3:12:02.240]  uh... but it it it's a transhumanist
[3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:06.160]  eugenicist death cult peter singer she said
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:10.000]  uh... but no seriously peter singer i love i love the language a colorful
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:12.360]  language you're you're increasing my vocabulary here
[3:12:12.360 --> 3:12:15.120]  and although i mean i'm but i'm not even joking is my point
[3:12:15.120 --> 3:12:18.000]  peter singer is their patron saint he's the guy that says
[3:12:18.000 --> 3:12:19.760]  children are like mackerel
[3:12:19.760 --> 3:12:22.600]  and i'm sure you've heard obama administrative officials have said
[3:12:22.600 --> 3:12:25.200]  you should even be able to kill babies at where they're born
[3:12:25.200 --> 3:12:27.800]  so this is a anti-life thing period
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:31.320]  correct but but but you're an expert on it too i'm just kind of embarrassing
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:33.240]  in a way she doesn't like me even talking about it but
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:35.160]  you know there it is it means my wife
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:37.520]  she has seen inside the pit
[3:12:37.520 --> 3:12:40.720]  i'm aware i'm aware that i i would love to talk to us in time and learn more
[3:12:40.720 --> 3:12:42.000]  about what she's seen
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.920]  all you know about that i don't know that okay but anyway that but that's okay
[3:12:44.920 --> 3:12:45.800]  uh...
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:49.240]  you know that it is it's funny that the the underbelly of the animal rights
[3:12:49.240 --> 3:12:52.160]  movement got all kinds of nutty stuff they've got artists they've got people
[3:12:52.160 --> 3:12:53.480]  who have attempted murder
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:12:54.200]  they've got
[3:12:54.200 --> 3:12:57.000]  you know folks beaten up their targets of baseball that
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:00.120]  and for some reason the public is all that surprised because we're used to
[3:13:00.120 --> 3:13:02.400]  extremists behaving extremely
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:06.160]  but for whatever reason this revelation that peter actually kills animals
[3:13:06.160 --> 3:13:07.040]  has taken
[3:13:07.040 --> 3:13:09.360]  us so much of the air out of their progress
[3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:12.760]  uh... you know this is it by our calculations this is cost them in excess
[3:13:12.760 --> 3:13:16.160]  of fourteen million dollars in according to their direct fundraising
[3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:17.120]  receipts
[3:13:17.120 --> 3:13:21.360]  and not only that but their applications for college age interns are down
[3:13:21.360 --> 3:13:25.040]  considerably so suddenly that the teenagers which is the sort of their
[3:13:25.040 --> 3:13:26.720]  uh... their future off
[3:13:26.720 --> 3:13:28.440]  of new members in new employees
[3:13:28.440 --> 3:13:31.560]  don't believe that peter is appears to be driven snow anymore
[3:13:31.560 --> 3:13:34.800]  if you don't have some walk somehow compromise which is more than that i
[3:13:34.800 --> 3:13:38.720]  won't even say the stuff she told me it's i mean rolling around on
[3:13:38.720 --> 3:13:41.800]  on on on uh... on
[3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:46.520]  on desk with with with wendy's hamburgers laughing insanely
[3:13:46.520 --> 3:13:50.560]  i mean these people are really out of their minds to be able to i i have to
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:54.200]  i can tell you i've talked to a few restaurant tours in norfolk
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:13:56.880]  who tell me about some of the p employees to sneak away for chicken
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:13:58.320]  sandwiches at lunch
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:01.560]  uh... so i i know that that not everybody who works there is a true
[3:14:01.560 --> 3:14:02.440]  believer
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:05.560]  but uh... i don't know if you told me the story of one of their main spokesman
[3:14:05.560 --> 3:14:06.720]  he's a guy
[3:14:06.720 --> 3:14:08.440]  laughing and giggling
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:11.880]  and and she's like what are you doing you know she's a big vegetarian lease
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:13.400]  was then she now eats me
[3:14:13.400 --> 3:14:17.160]  laughing and in literally laughing leaning back eating a hamburger that's the
[3:14:17.160 --> 3:14:17.840]  story
[3:14:17.840 --> 3:14:21.120]  or the bruce Friedrich or dan matthews
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:22.480]  well i don't know what that was
[3:14:22.480 --> 3:14:25.240]  that week i don't remember this is yours and i don't know
[3:14:25.240 --> 3:14:27.040]  yet no more go ahead
[3:14:27.040 --> 3:14:30.920]  but uh... regardless i i just i want to make sure everybody understands that
[3:14:30.920 --> 3:14:32.000]  that uh...
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:35.640]  you know while peter sort of the not case for injury animal rights world
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:39.160]  thereby no means the biggest threat to everybody's freedoms
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:42.120]  uh... i mean peter is kind of a national joke everybody understands that
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:44.280]  they're just there for comic relief value
[3:14:44.280 --> 3:14:48.560]  you might be surprised to learn that the humane society of the united states
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:53.240]  is actually the group that is a lot more likely to threaten your way of life
[3:14:53.240 --> 3:14:56.440]  uh... this is a group that's basically peter with a nicer wristwatch and and
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:14:59.120]  none of those naked interns that we like to look at so much
[3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:03.080]  yes but it's got the same exact goals of peter they want to push animal use out
[3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:05.960]  of the mainstream of society and they've got two hundred million dollars in the
[3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:06.520]  bank
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:11.520]  they're fabulously wealthy organization is a tool this is a tool by the uh...
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:14.600]  bioethicist by the zero growthers
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:16.560]  uh... by the rewilders
[3:15:16.560 --> 3:15:19.960]  uh... who wants sustainability they say they're going to use this to shut down
[3:15:19.960 --> 3:15:23.720]  farms ranches everything and they'll use something that sounds reasonable some
[3:15:23.720 --> 3:15:27.760]  sad monkey in a cage but really it's everything they want control
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:30.520]  you're right at the end of the day they want control of our diets because if
[3:15:30.520 --> 3:15:33.160]  you control food at fuel for humanity
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:36.120]  and then you control that basically the numbers of how many humans can live or
[3:15:36.120 --> 3:15:36.680]  die
[3:15:36.680 --> 3:15:39.400]  well sir i don't think they would be environmental movement trying to keep
[3:15:39.400 --> 3:15:41.720]  genetically modified crops out of africa
[3:15:41.720 --> 3:15:45.400]  you know they they would love very much to see a population in africa plummet by
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:46.560]  any means necessary
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:49.760]  well well david you've done a lot of research on peter so to me talking at
[3:15:49.760 --> 3:15:52.720]  you i just i just know you were aware some stuff i've talked about
[3:15:52.720 --> 3:15:57.040]  specifically though in your research have you found what we found that peter
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:15:59.960]  people like them they're really just anti-human
[3:15:59.960 --> 3:16:02.600]  i mean uh... we've heard all these announcers from the environmentalist we
[3:16:02.600 --> 3:16:04.200]  gotta cut our numbers all this
[3:16:04.200 --> 3:16:05.680]  i mean at the end of the day
[3:16:05.680 --> 3:16:08.760]  they just want to be able to out vote the rest of their fellow humans
[3:16:08.760 --> 3:16:11.440]  so they say we represent the bunny rabbits
[3:16:11.440 --> 3:16:14.000]  and we're gonna vote for him and take your ranch
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:17.440]  i think you're right uh... i mean you know it's funny if you watch washington
[3:16:17.440 --> 3:16:19.840]  all you'll know that next tuesday
[3:16:19.840 --> 3:16:21.400]  there's going to be a hearing
[3:16:21.400 --> 3:16:23.640]  a confirmation hearing for a guy named cast
[3:16:23.640 --> 3:16:24.800]  sunstein
[3:16:24.800 --> 3:16:28.520]  who is uh... president obama's pick to run the uh... regulatory office in the
[3:16:28.520 --> 3:16:31.600]  white house he's gonna be a regulatory czar they're calling
[3:16:31.600 --> 3:16:33.320]  he's a big animal rights lover
[3:16:33.320 --> 3:16:36.760]  he wants outlaw hunting and meat eating and biomedical research using animals
[3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:37.800]  and all this stuff
[3:16:37.800 --> 3:16:41.040]  and i think uh... you know you're gonna find suddenly that the animal rights
[3:16:41.040 --> 3:16:42.920]  not he's have a friend in the white house
[3:16:42.920 --> 3:16:44.800]  and i think at the end of the day you're right
[3:16:44.800 --> 3:16:48.040]  uh... it is all about controlling society i mean that you know the animals
[3:16:48.040 --> 3:16:51.240]  that just a placeholder for any other tool that can be used
[3:16:51.240 --> 3:16:55.120]  to uh... to marginalize traditional american values and you know basic things
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:57.520]  like capitalism and and free property
[3:16:57.520 --> 3:16:59.960]  you know let me give you an inside scoop
[3:16:59.960 --> 3:17:03.720]  and by the way my wife has been on the cover of
[3:17:03.720 --> 3:17:07.320]  u.s.a. today with peter so it's it's i mean she really did work with them
[3:17:07.320 --> 3:17:10.240]  uh... and i don't know i'm just telling the listeners but that's that's the
[3:17:10.240 --> 3:17:12.120]  many ways side issue
[3:17:12.120 --> 3:17:15.800]  she's there to see me i mean we went you know went right to the top in it
[3:17:15.800 --> 3:17:18.920]  uh... you know just by blind luck or whatever or because she was smart
[3:17:18.920 --> 3:17:20.160]  and i like her
[3:17:20.160 --> 3:17:23.320]  but she was like when she found out they were pressuring the lower level
[3:17:23.320 --> 3:17:26.120]  people to get animals and then they would leave only inject them there at
[3:17:26.120 --> 3:17:27.200]  the office
[3:17:27.200 --> 3:17:30.160]  she said what what in the world is this and they said listen
[3:17:30.160 --> 3:17:31.960]  these are invasive species
[3:17:31.960 --> 3:17:35.880]  we want to kill all pet animals all dogs all cats
[3:17:35.880 --> 3:17:37.320]  you're right
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:40.320]  you know you know you've ever seen the uh... the bumper sticker that says
[3:17:40.320 --> 3:17:42.080]  think globally and act locally
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:42.760]  yes
[3:17:42.760 --> 3:17:44.200]  he is acting locally
[3:17:44.200 --> 3:17:47.240]  they're trying to take as many pets out of circulation they can
[3:17:47.240 --> 3:17:51.280]  because their philosophy hold that if so if more and more americans have pets
[3:17:51.280 --> 3:17:54.800]  in this household than that's another sort of as you say an invasive species
[3:17:54.800 --> 3:17:58.480]  it's going to be drained on resources and protein and all this stuff
[3:17:58.480 --> 3:17:59.920]  so they just want to eliminate
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:02.760]  and they're doing it in their own little corner of god's greener
[3:18:02.760 --> 3:18:05.880]  yet no no i mean i've done the research i i i made the film in game and i'm just
[3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:07.440]  not joking with listeners
[3:18:07.440 --> 3:18:09.720]  these are this is an energy cult
[3:18:09.720 --> 3:18:12.920]  and if they can tax carbon if they can tax all the meat first which they're
[3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:13.960]  now passing
[3:18:13.960 --> 3:18:15.760]  get that control in
[3:18:15.760 --> 3:18:19.760]  the top echelons of this are totally cold-blooded they don't believe any of
[3:18:19.760 --> 3:18:21.440]  it's t-bone stakes
[3:18:21.440 --> 3:18:22.720]  finest wines and
[3:18:22.720 --> 3:18:28.800]  it's all about control it's all about dominating and feudalism and serfdom go
[3:18:28.800 --> 3:18:30.800]  ahead
[3:18:30.800 --> 3:18:33.760]  well i think i think that's one way of putting uh... another thing that i've
[3:18:33.760 --> 3:18:35.640]  said quite a lot which is that
[3:18:35.640 --> 3:18:39.520]  uh... you know that today's activists especially those coming from the left
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:42.240]  want to control society through its food
[3:18:42.240 --> 3:18:44.200]  it's labor and its energy
[3:18:44.200 --> 3:18:46.920]  and those of the three you know you control those three things there's
[3:18:46.920 --> 3:18:50.880]  nothing in society that can be done on its own without food labor energy
[3:18:50.880 --> 3:18:53.160]  so this is why you've got an environmental movement this is why you've
[3:18:53.160 --> 3:18:55.320]  got organized labor and this is why you've got
[3:18:55.320 --> 3:18:58.560]  uh... you know everybody from the mercury and fish scaremongers to the
[3:18:58.560 --> 3:19:01.440]  genetically modified food people who say it's going to get us a third glowing
[3:19:01.440 --> 3:19:02.340]  eyeball
[3:19:02.340 --> 3:19:05.560]  they're not to control our food or labor and our energy resources and that's how
[3:19:05.560 --> 3:19:07.080]  they're going to remake society
[3:19:07.080 --> 3:19:09.960]  apita is just one part of a much bigger picture that includes the green
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:10.920]  pieces
[3:19:10.920 --> 3:19:13.580]  the afl cio and and you name it
[3:19:13.580 --> 3:19:16.960]  now these really are despicable people they've got uh... the bioethicist
[3:19:16.960 --> 3:19:18.640]  movement that says well
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:20.280]  dashel wrote in a book
[3:19:20.280 --> 3:19:22.760]  if you're old you're supposed to go blind and die you're not going to get
[3:19:22.760 --> 3:19:23.600]  health care
[3:19:23.600 --> 3:19:25.240]  i mean he said that
[3:19:25.240 --> 3:19:28.800]  and because humans are bad and you're right got to kill your animals no more
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:30.200]  dogs no more cats
[3:19:30.200 --> 3:19:34.360]  basset hounds will be extinct german shepherds nothing we made nothing we
[3:19:34.360 --> 3:19:35.680]  bred will stay
[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:37.120]  everything will die
[3:19:37.120 --> 3:19:40.440]  they will kill all your cats kill all your dogs
[3:19:40.440 --> 3:19:42.960]  again it's hard for people to believe jeffrey dommer grabbed people off the
[3:19:42.960 --> 3:19:45.240]  street injected them with acid in the brain
[3:19:45.240 --> 3:19:46.480]  but he existed

[3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:37.480]  can even imagine i mean listen i thought my girlfriend
[3:24:37.480 --> 3:24:42.880]  was i couldn't believe it but i knew she was serious person and you know she
[3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:47.760]  showed me a shoebox of her in us today and a few things she did with pita they
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:55.160]  used her for media she had a degree in that and then years later everything she
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:24:59.160]  talked about sort of coming out in the news in fact david didn't they just catch
[3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:03.480]  one of them a year ago throwing hundreds of animals in a in a trash can
[3:25:03.480 --> 3:25:07.760]  uh... illegally i mean these are ghoulish crazy people and it's they're so crazy
[3:25:07.760 --> 3:25:10.320]  people can't believe they're really doing this
[3:25:10.320 --> 3:25:13.760]  it that's correct a few years ago summer of two thousand five
[3:25:13.760 --> 3:25:17.400]  uh... police in the town called a hockey north carolina
[3:25:17.400 --> 3:25:19.040]  caught two pita employees
[3:25:19.040 --> 3:25:22.120]  uh... throwing thirty four dead animals into a trash dumpster behind the
[3:25:22.120 --> 3:25:23.440]  grocery store
[3:25:23.440 --> 3:25:27.760]  and at the time uh... they had just literally hours before picked up these
[3:25:27.760 --> 3:25:31.200]  poor animals from a shelter and from a veterinarian
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:34.760]  and in many cases the animals didn't make it out of parking lot alive
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:37.480]  but they were killed in the back of the van and then tossed into a dumpster
[3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:40.840]  but that's what i mean they're like grave diggers it really is pretty sick
[3:25:40.840 --> 3:25:42.540]  frankly did you know that pita
[3:25:42.540 --> 3:25:46.640]  has taken a nine thousand seven hundred dollar tax deduction for a giant walk
[3:25:46.640 --> 3:25:48.920]  in the freezer at its headquarters building
[3:25:48.920 --> 3:25:51.400]  and in the trial of those two employees
[3:25:51.400 --> 3:25:55.440]  one of pita managers uh... conceded that the the walk-in freezer in that we're
[3:25:55.440 --> 3:25:58.800]  talking about a place uh... a freezer bigger than my office
[3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:03.600]  is just for storing dead bodies of animals and they've got a a crematory
[3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:06.320]  service that comes once a month to pick up the deadline
[3:26:06.320 --> 3:26:10.240]  but see that's what i'm talking about it's their obsessed with death i mean
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:12.560]  my wife said
[3:26:12.560 --> 3:26:16.480]  she was just immediately in the uppers sanctum of it
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:17.360]  that
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:21.160]  it was humans are evil we got rid of humans this is just getting people
[3:26:21.160 --> 3:26:22.360]  ready for it
[3:26:22.360 --> 3:26:25.800]  you know you know pita pita the early uh...
[3:26:25.800 --> 3:26:28.480]  founders were big fans of the earth first movement
[3:26:28.480 --> 3:26:31.720]  and you know they're big campfire chant was uh... you know people are living
[3:26:31.720 --> 3:26:33.200]  who should be dead
[3:26:33.200 --> 3:26:35.480]  that this is the whole idea of of uh... you know
[3:26:35.480 --> 3:26:39.880]  forced extinction of of a large portion of humanity and i think it would be a
[3:26:39.880 --> 3:26:44.160]  fair assumption to say that that one of pita's goals is to move humanity in that
[3:26:44.160 --> 3:26:45.880]  direction
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:50.120]  but that's the big foundation goals the rockefeller foundation
[3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:53.440]  i was just researching google most their foundation money
[3:26:53.440 --> 3:26:57.240]  goes to helping africans in sustainability
[3:26:57.240 --> 3:27:01.400]  uh... these people you know everything i look into
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:05.480]  it ends with these people and pita is just one extension of them like you said
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:09.680]  isn't pita involved advising some of the bigger animal groups
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:13.160]  well pita is is one of the bigger animal groups itself but it certainly is
[3:27:13.160 --> 3:27:16.800]  involved with uh... advising a host of smaller ones around the world
[3:27:16.800 --> 3:27:19.400]  and remember now pita is not just doing this domestically
[3:27:19.400 --> 3:27:23.800]  you know they've got offices in england in france in germany in hong kong in
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:25.080]  australia
[3:27:25.080 --> 3:27:26.920]  uh... they're they're going global
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:30.760]  so they they're really trying to uh... achieve the implementation of their
[3:27:30.760 --> 3:27:33.540]  agenda anywhere they can get a foot in the door
[3:27:33.540 --> 3:27:36.960]  the only place it seems that the throw them out so far as the philippines
[3:27:36.960 --> 3:27:38.920]  but that everybody's willing to have
[3:27:38.920 --> 3:27:42.560]  because they're frankly they're fun to watch
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:44.400]  it's amazing uh...
[3:27:44.400 --> 3:27:47.400]  these sickos though have been exposed by you and others tell folks about the
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:48.480]  websites and
[3:27:48.480 --> 3:27:50.880]  i mean it does seem they're in retreat now
[3:27:50.880 --> 3:27:54.200]  because just how macabre they are is really come out
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:27:57.040]  well peter certainly is in retreat but i think it's again it's important to
[3:27:57.040 --> 3:27:59.320]  note that the humane society of the u.s
[3:27:59.320 --> 3:27:59.880]  has been
[3:27:59.880 --> 3:28:03.120]  you know picking up where pita left off this is just a richer

[3:35:04.480 --> 3:35:08.160]  this year were world illegal and i had the awesome police chief in here and he
[3:35:08.160 --> 3:35:10.640]  said we don't care what the state says we're doing it
[3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:14.640]  uh and uh the legislatures you know been trying to fight it
[3:35:14.640 --> 3:35:18.720]  uh but going to mr ford ford uh tell us so what happened to you as an elected
[3:35:18.720 --> 3:35:22.720]  representative up in duncanville uh for daring to speak out of the city
[3:35:22.720 --> 3:35:27.360]  council meeting well what happened with this earlier that evening in briefing
[3:35:27.360 --> 3:35:31.760]  which is a about an hour long meeting that precedes the open meeting itself
[3:35:31.760 --> 3:35:35.120]  the mayor told me that if i spoke when he told me not to
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:40.400]  he would have me arrested and i explained him at the time in the
[3:35:40.400 --> 3:35:43.360]  briefing room that unlike all those thousands and thousands of people who
[3:35:43.360 --> 3:35:48.640]  are getting red light camera tickets who are not entitled to trials by jury
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:51.840]  i would be entitled to a trial by jury if he arrested me for
[3:35:51.840 --> 3:35:55.520]  whatever it was he had in mind and i would with confidence
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:36:00.640]  put my fate in their hands so we go out on the floor for the actual meeting
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:05.680]  and agenda item three was a they've squandered so much money in our city
[3:36:05.680 --> 3:36:09.360]  we have a huge deficit now and so they're trying to cut back on essential
[3:36:09.360 --> 3:36:14.160]  services like street repairs so they had a bill out to cancel a
[3:36:14.160 --> 3:36:18.880]  $59,000 contract for the street repair company
[3:36:18.880 --> 3:36:23.360]  and i was going to speak against it so it was my turn to speak and i said
[3:36:23.360 --> 3:36:26.640]  thank you mr mayor before i address agenda item three
[3:36:26.640 --> 3:36:29.600]  i want to let everyone know what the mayor told me in briefing
[3:36:29.600 --> 3:36:33.120]  a few minutes ago and i related what i told you just now
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:36.960]  and it took all of 30 seconds so about halfway into it the mayor starts
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:40.800]  banging his gavel and shouting at me that i'm out of order
[3:36:40.800 --> 3:36:45.920]  and then it was all rehearsed he called for the city manager the city manager
[3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:49.760]  kent kegel called for the police chief robert brown
[3:36:49.760 --> 3:36:53.440]  and at that point the city manager got up walked behind me tap
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:56.320]  one of the other councilman on the shoulder and then all the other
[3:36:56.320 --> 3:37:00.640]  councilman except one who wasn't in on it got up and walked off
[3:37:00.640 --> 3:37:04.240]  police chief came over to one side marshal came over to the other side
[3:37:04.240 --> 3:37:07.280]  and a third man another officer in plain clothes
[3:37:07.280 --> 3:37:10.960]  walked behind them with a video camera so you can just imagine this parade of
[3:37:10.960 --> 3:37:15.360]  people coming up and by that time i finished my
[3:37:15.360 --> 3:37:20.320]  32nd digression about how i would welcome a jury of my peers and i would
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:24.640]  confidently put my fate in their hands and i returned to the agenda item
[3:37:24.640 --> 3:37:28.080]  agenda item three and i began with i will not vote for
[3:37:28.080 --> 3:37:31.760]  this and here are my reasons why this is a contract this is a bill to
[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:35.360]  cancel a street repair contract and i don't believe we should
[3:37:35.360 --> 3:37:38.480]  and at that point the police chief came over to me and said
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:42.160]  i'm going to ask you to leave voluntarily so i stood up
[3:37:42.160 --> 3:37:45.920]  put my hands behind my back and said i will not leave voluntarily
[3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:49.680]  however if you believe that i'm violating the law by discussing this
[3:37:49.680 --> 3:37:54.480]  agenda item i will submit to arrest without resistance
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:58.240]  so he repeated i want you to leave voluntarily
[3:37:58.240 --> 3:38:01.920]  and i repeated what i said that i won't leave voluntarily but i'll
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:05.520]  submit to arrest without resistance and understand i have my hands behind my
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:08.960]  back at this point waiting to be handcuffed they never said to me you're
[3:38:08.960 --> 3:38:11.760]  under arrest they never said if you don't leave you'll be arrested
[3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:15.920]  nothing like that with my hands behind my back offering to be handcuffed
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:19.200]  they acted as if i was resisting oh they grabbed me
[3:38:19.200 --> 3:38:22.080]  yeah they grabbed me and started dragging me along
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:25.600]  and i said hey you know i've had back surgery twice
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:29.120]  and that kind of encouraged them to be more rough
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:32.480]  and as they're dragging me along i started to stumble on the steps
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:36.800]  then as we entered into the corridor leading away from the city council
[3:38:36.800 --> 3:38:40.320]  chamber i started to fall and they pushed me down
[3:38:40.320 --> 3:38:43.680]  on the ground and i landed very heavily on my side
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:49.200]  oh and yeah so i don't know i'd yeah yeah so i ended up being having to go to
[3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:52.640]  the hospital and they'd never placed me under arrest
[3:38:52.640 --> 3:38:56.720]  they didn't send an officer in the ambulance with me
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:39:00.240]  and by the way there's photos and videos of this out and the newspapers all
[3:39:00.240 --> 3:39:03.600]  report that exactly what you're saying is what happened
[3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:06.400]  right and you're lucky they didn't taser you
[3:39:06.400 --> 3:39:12.720]  uh separately they've introduced a bill hr 1966 that if something you say is
[3:39:12.720 --> 3:39:16.800]  hurtful and someone says that was hurtful to me or hurt my feelings
[3:39:16.800 --> 3:39:20.640]  you're going to be charged with a federal felony so free speech itself is
[3:39:20.640 --> 3:39:25.760]  under incredible attack please continue uh fellow thought criminal
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:30.640]  well i guess that 1966 is just a variation of the old theme of a hate crime
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:35.680]  yeah i imagine well so it so i'm in i'm in the hospital bed in my back i can't
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:39.360]  move i'm urinating on on my side until i get one of those
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:43.200]  plastic things that they give you in the hospital and i look on the tv and
[3:39:43.200 --> 3:39:47.280]  there's the mayor saying that they've issued a warrant for my arrest
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:51.600]  so it turns out they got a local judge of city employee
[3:39:51.600 --> 3:39:55.920]  serving as a magistrate signed a warrant for me i'm charged now in texas with a
[3:39:55.920 --> 3:40:00.400]  class b misdemeanor of disrupting a public meeting
[3:40:00.400 --> 3:40:04.000]  so i'm in hospital for four days and i at the time
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:07.360]  this uh of this event happened i was using one cane
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:11.920]  because as i said i've had back surgery twice most recently in 2006
[3:40:11.920 --> 3:40:15.760]  so when i left the hospital i had the choice either use a walker or use two
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:20.000]  canes by the way i found being handicapped or disabled for a time
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:22.640]  only from what i've seen and i don't know exactly why
[3:40:22.640 --> 3:40:25.920]  that seems to encourage thugs kind of like a wolf-like
[3:40:25.920 --> 3:40:30.160]  mentality of a of a hurt sheep or something i've never understood they
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:33.280]  seem to piranha on anybody that's hurt yeah
[3:40:33.280 --> 3:40:37.040]  yeah that's interesting observation you've made that because it uh i've
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:39.920]  definitely found that through the members of the city council
[3:40:39.920 --> 3:40:43.840]  and as my back condition has gotten worse they have gotten
[3:40:43.840 --> 3:40:47.440]  more aggressive and they finally just went all out on april 7th
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:51.520]  yeah their predatory spirit comes out now uh looking back to the red light
[3:40:51.520 --> 3:40:54.720]  cameras they had to remove sandiego as it sounds like you know
[3:40:54.720 --> 3:40:58.240]  because under the constitution you get to face your accuser this is a robot a
[3:40:58.240 --> 3:41:02.160]  computer yeah they lockheed martin the defense contractor making money off of
[3:41:02.160 --> 3:41:05.280]  it i know state courts in texas have said they can't do this
[3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:08.960]  without having a license for private executive work
[3:41:08.960 --> 3:41:13.120]  yeah the work but but they just don't care the awesome police if he said i
[3:41:13.120 --> 3:41:16.880]  don't care we have swat team stand by for rule
[3:41:16.880 --> 3:41:19.840]  they'll get they'll they'll do it until they can't get away with it until the
[3:41:19.840 --> 3:41:23.040]  politicians who enable these things are voted out of office
[3:41:23.040 --> 3:41:26.400]  now i know that there are many people in the texas state who are against it i've
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:29.840]  been in close contact with many members of the urban affairs committee for
[3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:32.560]  example and there's a lot of sentiment to do away with them
[3:41:32.560 --> 3:41:35.840]  yeah polls are over 90 percent in the state against it everywhere else but
[3:41:35.840 --> 3:41:39.920]  again magically it just continues you we don't want to go on every issue we
[3:41:39.920 --> 3:41:41.680]  don't want it the government just says look
[3:41:41.680 --> 3:41:45.840]  north com standing by you know the military standing by this is the new
[3:41:45.840 --> 3:41:48.640]  america but you know alex the big the real problem
[3:41:48.640 --> 3:41:51.120]  that i'm encountering here in duncanville texas
[3:41:51.120 --> 3:41:54.800]  is tremendous voter apathy people will say that they're upset about something
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:41:58.240]  but as to taking any action even just voting
[3:41:58.240 --> 3:42:01.520]  uh... most people just not willing to do that i mean we'll be lucky this election
[3:42:01.520 --> 3:42:04.800]  if we have ten or eleven percent of eligible voters actually voting
[3:42:04.800 --> 3:42:07.920]  you know the national average is eight point two percent turnout but they'll
[3:42:07.920 --> 3:42:10.160]  turn out with some stupid presidential diversion
[3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:13.840]  when the real powers locally so so you're hurt in the hospital on your side
[3:42:13.840 --> 3:42:16.080]  urinating into a into a bucket
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:19.280]  uh... well i'm not quite but similar to that yeah well you said into something
[3:42:19.280 --> 3:42:22.480]  the point is yeah so you're there this is going on
[3:42:22.480 --> 3:42:26.960]  you're now that they're grandstanding on tv you're this arch criminal on the loose
[3:42:26.960 --> 3:42:30.160]  what happens next yeah well actually play that up quite a bit
[3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:33.760]  the uh... the mayor was they they uh... they contradicted themselves but they
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:36.800]  were trying to get across the idea that i'm this dangerous felon
[3:42:36.800 --> 3:42:41.600]  and of course this is my my first so far my only uh... arrest for anything
[3:42:41.600 --> 3:42:45.760]  and the mayor said that uh... the city manager ken kegel said that
[3:42:45.760 --> 3:42:49.040]  they have had to increase the police presence
[3:42:49.040 --> 3:42:51.920]  at the city hall whenever i'm there
[3:42:51.920 --> 3:42:55.600]  oh yeah and he was said be well because with all that's happening you just
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:42:58.560]  don't know that was his excuse for this over time
[3:42:58.560 --> 3:43:02.560]  and then the mayor said that they are from now on they're going to assign a
[3:43:02.560 --> 3:43:05.440]  full-time officer to me whenever i'm in the building
[3:43:05.440 --> 3:43:08.960]  because and he actually said this to a reporter he said because
[3:43:08.960 --> 3:43:14.560]  mr ford is a mystery man who has conspiracy theories
[3:43:14.560 --> 3:43:18.560]  so uh... they're painting me as is this very violent guy so i get out of the
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:21.600]  hospital i'm limping along on two canes now
[3:43:21.600 --> 3:43:24.800]  as i said it was either that or walker and i already had the two canes i heard
[3:43:24.800 --> 3:43:28.080]  you may actually be the the the the the the the the person known as
[3:43:28.080 --> 3:43:31.120]  godzilla i mean you're like come from the sea
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:35.120]  from the deep you're like this deadly kraken uh...
[3:43:35.120 --> 3:43:38.240]  i mean you're a boogeyman that you're what children fear under beds i mean how
[3:43:38.240 --> 3:43:42.720]  dare you not want the red light cameras the mayor and people this is very
[3:43:42.720 --> 3:43:45.520]  important you know that uh... they get all this done
[3:43:45.520 --> 3:43:48.880]  so so so you're out there on the cane vicious yeah well
[3:43:48.880 --> 3:43:51.760]  well one thing i want to point out that the red light cameras that and then a
[3:43:51.760 --> 3:43:55.200]  website that i recently set up paul ford reports were kind of it the uh...
[3:43:55.200 --> 3:43:58.240]  perver perver straw that broke the camel's back
[3:43:58.240 --> 3:44:01.280]  i have been for the two years and i've been on the council
[3:44:01.280 --> 3:44:05.280]  constantly asking a lot of questions that the other members most of the other
[3:44:05.280 --> 3:44:08.800]  members of the city council do not want to ask and bringing up a lot of
[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:11.200]  connections campaign contributions
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:14.640]  relationships things like that
[3:44:14.640 --> 3:44:18.640]  there's a lot of money being wasted on on developments that don't go anywhere
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:22.240]  there's a lot of sweetheart deals it's just a constant sort of thing
[3:44:22.240 --> 3:44:26.240]  there's this like everything has to it some sort of secondary agenda
[3:44:26.240 --> 3:44:30.240]  where there's some money being diverted i mean even even such simple things as
[3:44:30.240 --> 3:44:33.680]  uh... we're running up this huge budget deficit and now they're instituting
[3:44:33.680 --> 3:44:35.680]  forced uh... furloughs they're letting
[3:44:35.680 --> 3:44:39.440]  they're letting uh... giving workers days off without pay
[3:44:39.440 --> 3:44:43.600]  and you know and no one mandatory mandatory in that and
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:46.960]  this bill the city council members is still traveling around the country
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:48.320]  going to reno and
[3:44:48.320 --> 3:44:52.000]  orlando on these uh... junkets allegedly maybe they should just declare
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:53.600]  themselves royalty
[3:44:53.600 --> 3:44:56.960]  uh... councilman and declare themselves royalty and start wearing crowns or
[3:44:56.960 --> 3:45:00.240]  something let me add a point here i have the department of homeland security
[3:45:00.240 --> 3:45:02.000]  you probably heard about the report a month ago
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:04.960]  where they said veterans and gun owners the number one terror threat
[3:45:04.960 --> 3:45:08.400]  right right right well this is the appendix to that it says alternative
[3:45:08.400 --> 3:45:10.640]  media that make connections
[3:45:10.640 --> 3:45:13.920]  so maybe you're a terrorist because you're making connections about
[3:45:13.920 --> 3:45:17.280]  political contributions to them and then and then what they're doing
[3:45:17.280 --> 3:45:20.800]  uh... but it says here in the alternative media section
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:21.920]  right there
[3:45:21.920 --> 3:45:24.320]  this is in the first page of the appendix
[3:45:24.320 --> 3:45:26.560]  uh... to document you
[3:45:26.560 --> 3:45:30.480]  it says alternative media term user describe various information sources
[3:45:30.480 --> 3:45:33.200]  that provide a forum for interpretations of events
[3:45:33.200 --> 3:45:36.640]  and issues that differ radically from those presented in mass media
[3:45:36.640 --> 3:45:38.000]  products and outlets
[3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:42.000]  this is a terrorism lexicon sir so you've started an alternative news site
[3:45:42.000 --> 3:45:44.800]  and you're asking questions and making connections
[3:45:44.800 --> 3:45:49.680]  my god no wonder you had to be assaulted sir you're this is al-qaeda
[3:45:49.680 --> 3:45:52.640]  well that's uh... that certainly is the impression that they're trying to get
[3:45:52.640 --> 3:45:53.840]  across the people
[3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:56.480]  and uh... i suspect that it is quite
[3:45:56.480 --> 3:45:59.600]  i'm so people are disappointed when they meet me and i find out that i'm just
[3:45:59.600 --> 3:46:02.560]  sort of a regular regular guy but you know
[3:46:02.560 --> 3:46:06.240]  though you have some in the hospital i get out and i have this one for my
[3:46:06.240 --> 3:46:09.600]  arrest so i turn myself into the duncanville police
[3:46:09.600 --> 3:46:14.160]  and they transport me in handcuffs down to dallas county jail and i spend about
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:17.920]  twelve twelve and a half hours there before i'm bonded out loose steric
[3:46:17.920 --> 3:46:19.920]  loose steric yeah loose there
[3:46:19.920 --> 3:46:21.840]  or stare at a very nice place
[3:46:21.840 --> 3:46:25.360]  well actually you know that it was kind of amusing at one point because i was
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:26.960]  in the the big holding area
[3:46:26.960 --> 3:46:30.800]  oh and but with all these guards and other prisoners and and the guard asked
[3:46:30.800 --> 3:46:32.080]  me like well you know you don't
[3:46:32.080 --> 3:46:34.800]  you don't think they fit in here i mean like what are you in for
[3:46:34.800 --> 3:46:39.600]  and just then a television report came on of my of my turning myself in
[3:46:39.600 --> 3:46:42.640]  and i said we'll take a look over there and all the inmates and the guards are
[3:46:42.640 --> 3:46:43.600]  saying
[3:46:43.600 --> 3:46:46.640]  man that's terrible they can't do that to you
[3:46:46.640 --> 3:46:50.080]  and you gotta kick you got a good case here you know this will never stick to
[3:46:50.080 --> 3:46:50.400]  them
[3:46:50.400 --> 3:46:52.160]  well perhaps we'll see
[3:46:52.160 --> 3:46:55.920]  well this is a funny story are you are the fact this is a phenomenon around
[3:46:55.920 --> 3:46:58.000]  the country and if i was you had to be careful
[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:01.120]  they have things where a sheriff gets elected so the old sheriff kills them
[3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:03.200]  that happens about once i read about that yeah
[3:47:03.200 --> 3:47:07.120]  i'll see it constantly it's probably been 50 cases i know i mean or
[3:47:07.120 --> 3:47:10.960]  oh it's constant and murdering new police chiefs cops killing other cops
[3:47:10.960 --> 3:47:16.080]  beating up city councilmen i mean this is widespread sir so i would carry
[3:47:16.080 --> 3:47:19.680]  a camera on you at all times now obviously there's times you're allowed to
[3:47:19.680 --> 3:47:22.240]  talk and you can put things on the agenda or
[3:47:22.240 --> 3:47:27.760]  is the mayor engaging in a parliamentary tyranny where they're shutting you down
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:30.880]  good question what they do when you ask them see they don't follow robert's
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:34.000]  rules of order which has very strict rules for who can speak and how they
[3:47:34.000 --> 3:47:35.120]  can speak and how
[3:47:35.120 --> 3:47:38.640]  meeting should be moderated what they when you ask them why they deviating
[3:47:38.640 --> 3:47:41.680]  from robert's rules they say well we operate under
[3:47:41.680 --> 3:47:45.440]  modified robert's rules and then when you ask them well what are the
[3:47:45.440 --> 3:47:50.080]  modifications and they don't answer you what they rely on is a part of our
[3:47:50.080 --> 3:47:53.760]  charter says the mayor will preside over meetings which means to me
[3:47:53.760 --> 3:47:58.080]  he'll be the moderator he'll be the one kind of like the the host of a new show
[3:47:58.080 --> 3:48:01.360]  like mclaughlin group or something but now you're never allowed to talk and he
[3:48:01.360 --> 3:48:04.480]  just sits up there with his own robert cash machine
[3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:08.480]  actually actually i mean i'm i'm still i'm allowed to talk and i want to tell
[3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:11.440]  you that they they've really backed off because what what
[3:48:11.440 --> 3:48:15.040]  i think most people in this type of position as the mayor and the most of
[3:48:15.040 --> 3:48:18.240]  the other members of the city council there's one city council
[3:48:18.240 --> 3:48:20.720]  woman of a woman named janette jamison who was
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:24.080]  tremendously offended by what is going on in duncanville
[3:48:24.080 --> 3:48:27.760]  and when the very upset with what they did to me but the others
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:30.720]  basically act as a monolithic block in this
[3:48:30.720 --> 3:48:37.840]  and the um... they do not like publicity and what they at what they
[3:48:37.840 --> 3:48:42.000]  did not anticipate how the reaction that their attack on me
[3:48:42.000 --> 3:48:45.920]  would engender and all the on all the letters and emails of support that i
[3:48:45.920 --> 3:48:49.680]  received and i know many letters and emails have gone into city hall very
[3:48:49.680 --> 3:48:53.760]  critical of their actions so they backed off of it we had a city council
[3:48:53.760 --> 3:48:56.880]  we know no hold on a second but councilman that's that's why the
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:00.480]  tyrants are such nuts you finally stood up to him
[3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:03.920]  you're constitutional you're with the courts you're with the polls you're with
[3:49:03.920 --> 3:49:09.120]  the people you're with the republic against these evil red light cameras
[3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:13.600]  they violate your rights they set you up they beat you up they demonize you
[3:49:13.600 --> 3:49:17.280]  and now the people see it for what it is they they don't like the red light
[3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:19.520]  cameras you're going to be a hero you're probably
[3:49:19.520 --> 3:49:22.720]  going to end up being the next mayor if they don't
[3:49:22.720 --> 3:49:26.400]  you know i do something to your calling a mechanic on you
[3:49:26.400 --> 3:49:29.760]  well uh... here's the thing though again we're dealing with a very low voter
[3:49:29.760 --> 3:49:32.960]  turnout i mean i i'm up for the election right now the final day of voting is
[3:49:32.960 --> 3:49:35.600]  saturday i could i could easily lose i don't know
[3:49:35.600 --> 3:49:40.000]  we're not getting a huge huge turnout most people are still relatively
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:43.040]  unaware of what's happening and more than that they're relatively
[3:49:43.040 --> 3:49:46.240]  unaware of the impact of these events on their own lives
[3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:48.880]  you know there's sometimes people will say
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:52.400]  be to vote about in local elections i'm only concerned with the national
[3:49:52.400 --> 3:49:55.360]  election and i'm like we'll look at your city tax bill
[3:49:55.360 --> 3:49:58.560]  think about your the quality of your police services
[3:49:58.560 --> 3:50:02.880]  your fires of code enforcement are they harassing you or are they being
[3:50:02.880 --> 3:50:05.520]  supportive of you these are the things that are all
[3:50:05.520 --> 3:50:09.520]  addressed at the local level and most people still don't get that
[3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:14.320]  and plus i think you have a general trend of apathy in this country i mean it's
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:17.760]  hard for local politics to compete with american idol and dancing with the
[3:50:17.760 --> 3:50:18.880]  stars
[3:50:18.880 --> 3:50:21.680]  yeah well folks are gonna get empty bellies are pretty sense of all
[3:50:21.680 --> 3:50:25.520]  well you know what which one is when things happen that impact
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:29.760]  person's day-to-day experience that it's that uh... that they can grasp
[3:50:29.760 --> 3:50:33.840]  concretely but i'm not abstract to really get people fired up so so
[3:50:33.840 --> 3:50:37.440]  councilmember uh... uh... uh... forward i mean in donkenville poll for
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:41.200]  i'm trying to stand they have got their tail between their legs
[3:50:41.200 --> 3:50:44.400]  well i don't know i wouldn't go quite that far i think that this last meeting
[3:50:44.400 --> 3:50:48.080]  we had last night they backed off because i made a comment very similar to
[3:50:48.080 --> 3:50:49.280]  the one that i made

[3:51:08.800 --> 3:51:12.080]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[3:51:12.080 --> 3:51:16.000]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about performing gold and silver
[3:51:16.000 --> 3:51:19.360]  before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again

[3:54:35.440 --> 3:54:37.600]  get them that's all part of the fun of being a
[3:54:37.600 --> 3:54:39.520]  president planet dot tv remember you can see me
[3:54:39.520 --> 3:54:44.000]  fighting the fruit flies there's like little f-16s and i'm king kong up here
[3:54:44.000 --> 3:54:47.760]  uh... going back to the fellow thought criminal duncanville city council
[3:54:47.760 --> 3:54:50.480]  member here in texas
[3:54:50.480 --> 3:54:54.640]  uh... and uh... a big suburb of dallas pretty good size town
[3:54:54.640 --> 3:54:58.480]  paul ford enclosing paul you're going to get the jury trial
[3:54:58.480 --> 3:55:02.800]  i would you know go in and show that uh... i wouldn't even argue the roberts rule
[3:55:02.800 --> 3:55:05.440]  thing with them obviously you know what you're doing
[3:55:05.440 --> 3:55:09.040]  i would just show that uh... they were telling you to voluntarily leave on the
[3:55:09.040 --> 3:55:12.000]  why they arrest you that you certainly got an official oppression
[3:55:12.000 --> 3:55:14.480]  and i wouldn't be nice about this because
[3:55:14.480 --> 3:55:17.200]  i wouldn't turn your back on these people either they'll throw you down on the
[3:55:17.200 --> 3:55:18.400]  ground
[3:55:18.400 --> 3:55:22.800]  uh... and you know enjoy themselves they don't think of us the slaves as humans
[3:55:22.800 --> 3:55:26.160]  until they are taught that we're not their slaves that's all i think social
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:29.920]  pass understand so i hope you go after these people legally
[3:55:29.920 --> 3:55:30.560]  well
[3:55:30.560 --> 3:55:33.600]  well i want to dress the criminal aspect of it first and when that's it
[3:55:33.600 --> 3:55:36.240]  that's all finished and i'll i'll give more thought to that
[3:55:36.240 --> 3:55:38.240]  all right we're almost out of time so go ahead
[3:55:38.240 --> 3:55:41.120]  all right yeah i just wanted to say that i welcome the trial because i believe
[3:55:41.120 --> 3:55:44.320]  that that the more publicity their actions get
[3:55:44.320 --> 3:55:47.280]  the less likely that they are to repeat them in the future against me or
[3:55:47.280 --> 3:55:48.400]  anyone else
[3:55:48.400 --> 3:55:51.760]  and that's my hope that when everything's brought out in a jury trial and i'm
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:54.240]  acquitted it will discourage them from repeating it
[3:55:54.240 --> 3:55:57.120]  against me and discourage other people from trying to emulate them in the
[3:55:57.120 --> 3:56:00.240]  other cities in texas
[3:56:00.240 --> 3:56:02.160]  absolutely
[3:56:02.160 --> 3:56:06.240]  all right uh... well i mean well so so where is this going now you're gonna get
[3:56:06.240 --> 3:56:09.200]  i guess go ahead and face trial for talking as a city council member at city
[3:56:09.200 --> 3:56:10.400]  council
[3:56:10.400 --> 3:56:12.320]  that's the way it appears now yes
[3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:14.800]  are you gonna go after them for uh...
[3:56:14.800 --> 3:56:16.720]  for assaulting you
[3:56:16.720 --> 3:56:17.600]  i don't know
[3:56:17.600 --> 3:56:20.080]  at this point i don't know and
[3:56:20.080 --> 3:56:23.360]  but like i said i have my first court appearance of my first court date is
[3:56:23.360 --> 3:56:25.040]  next week on may twelve
[3:56:25.040 --> 3:56:26.960]  and uh... i'll i'll just take it
[3:56:26.960 --> 3:56:28.240]  take it from that point
[3:56:28.240 --> 3:56:31.840]  but i am looking forward to a jury trial i'm looking forward to six people
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:34.000]  drawn from the ranks of dallas county
[3:56:34.000 --> 3:56:36.640]  voters and uh... making the case and
[3:56:36.640 --> 3:56:40.000]  i'm sure that it will be a quote i'm sure that will end in acquittal this time
[3:56:40.000 --> 3:56:43.680]  and if they arrest me again the next time the time after that
[3:56:43.680 --> 3:56:45.040]  and maybe eventually
[3:56:45.040 --> 3:56:48.480]  this will discourage them from doing this to me and as i say to others because
[3:56:48.480 --> 3:56:52.160]  this has been tremendously inhibiting to other people in dunkville i mean i've
[3:56:52.160 --> 3:56:52.880]  had people
[3:56:52.880 --> 3:56:55.760]  told me that they don't want to go to city council meetings now because they're
[3:56:55.760 --> 3:56:56.400]  afraid
[3:56:56.400 --> 3:56:59.200]  that something's going to happen to know that's what they want they basically
[3:56:59.200 --> 3:57:01.360]  banned public speaking here in austin now
