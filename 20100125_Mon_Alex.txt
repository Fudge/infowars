[00:43.200 --> 00:49.480]  today we have Mike Adams the health ranger joining us to chronicle and
[00:49.480 --> 00:55.320]  detail and break down how the flu hoax the government run flu hoax of 2009
[00:55.320 --> 01:00.880]  completely imploded and there's open talk of criminal charges against World
[01:00.880 --> 01:05.000]  Health Organization officials EU officials giant investigations head of
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.800]  the EU health board saying it was a dangerous vaccine and a fraud
[01:08.800 --> 01:13.600]  premeditated when they found the clear evidence of a revolving door in Europe
[01:13.600 --> 01:20.520]  England the United States Canada Australia all over the globe of the big
[01:20.520 --> 01:25.560]  five vaccine pharma makers that got the big government contracts paying off
[01:25.560 --> 01:30.660]  almost every member of the government that made decisions on buying tens of
[01:30.660 --> 01:35.160]  billions of dollars worth of the useless dangerous vaccine it's useless
[01:35.160 --> 01:40.360]  unless you want to hurt somebody that is coming up in the third hour now I
[01:40.360 --> 01:45.960]  spent Monday Tuesday and Wednesday of last week almost exclusively talking
[01:45.960 --> 01:50.320]  about how they shut down the North Austin gun show the oldest gun show in
[01:50.320 --> 01:55.000]  central Texas and one of the biggest since then it's become an entirely
[01:55.000 --> 02:02.720]  different issue media hoax police hoax lies they are all over every TV station
[02:02.720 --> 02:08.640]  attacking me they are all over the radio lying and attacking yours truly
[02:08.640 --> 02:11.920]  everywhere and I'm not even paying attention to it and I'm seeing it
[02:11.920 --> 02:18.280]  everywhere saying that it's the law you can't privately sell someone a gun not
[02:18.280 --> 02:23.080]  your neighbor you can't even when your dad dies you can't get his guns it's
[02:23.080 --> 02:27.000]  got to be done through the Feds this will be the end of private transfers of
[02:27.000 --> 02:34.960]  firearms and it is even bigger than the 68 gun control act and it's being done
[02:34.960 --> 02:39.560]  outside of the law now I made a specific big deal with Larry Pratt and
[02:39.560 --> 02:44.120]  countless other constitutional experts here about how there was no law they
[02:44.120 --> 02:48.680]  just intimidated the leaseholder H. E. B. the grocery store chain it's an old
[02:48.680 --> 02:55.280]  grocery store building into shutting it down entirely and in the first forcing
[02:55.280 --> 03:03.560]  Darwin that occurred to post the sign saying no more private sales since then
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.840]  they say oh no it's a nuisance abatement law like a crack house and there
[03:08.840 --> 03:12.320]  also have a hoax in the media that someone was arrested it's on record that
[03:12.320 --> 03:15.160]  no one was arrested they put him in handcuffs took him outside and
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.720]  interrogated him saying you thought about selling an illegal a gun in the
[03:19.720 --> 03:24.120]  city of Austin illegals don't get DWI's they don't get taken to jail for no
[03:24.120 --> 03:28.280]  driver's license like citizens do they over 90% of them don't have to pay their
[03:28.280 --> 03:31.520]  gas or power bill they just use fake matriculas and if somebody else knew
[03:31.520 --> 03:36.640]  sign up they just got to pay the first $250 deposit and they don't have to
[03:36.640 --> 03:39.480]  follow the same rules and apartments all over the country that's confirmed
[03:39.480 --> 03:43.960]  because the government wants to overrun the country with illegals to blow out
[03:43.960 --> 03:48.440]  the wages and create a political arm they can use to be sicked on the American
[03:48.440 --> 03:52.280]  people so when the Austin Police Department their propagandists know
[03:52.280 --> 03:56.880]  that they've been caught engaged in clear criminal activity racketeering you
[03:56.880 --> 04:00.560]  name it I've had top constitutional law experts on that agree with me on that
[04:00.560 --> 04:09.080]  analysis color of law no statutory authority now they just make up oh well
[04:09.080 --> 04:14.240]  do a nuisance abatement to shut you down well they already shut it down and so
[04:14.240 --> 04:17.440]  there's a protest today at the Austin Police Department I heard about it over
[04:17.440 --> 04:22.880]  the weekend I commend the citizens that are doing this and I'm gonna be there
[04:22.880 --> 04:28.640]  five to seven o'clock today downtown Austin right off 7th and 8th Street

[04:39.880 --> 04:43.320]  right up the block from there I had police a few years ago tell me I couldn't
[04:43.320 --> 04:46.160]  bullhorn even though they'd lost lawsuits over it and I said go ahead and
[04:46.160 --> 04:49.560]  arrest me so we'll see what happens with that today I'm gonna defend the
[04:49.560 --> 04:53.600]  Second Amendment and I don't care where you are in Texas get your car take off
[04:53.600 --> 04:57.200]  work and get your butt down here to Austin Texas because they're gonna use
[04:57.200 --> 05:01.600]  this to shut down gun shows nationwide this is Alex Jones with five good
[05:01.600 --> 05:05.600]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[05:05.600 --> 05:09.400]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.480]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:13.480 --> 05:17.520]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in
[05:17.520 --> 05:21.920]  the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of
[05:21.920 --> 05:25.400]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[05:25.400 --> 05:29.160]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.160 --> 05:33.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.240 --> 05:36.960]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[05:36.960 --> 05:41.040]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.040 --> 05:43.760]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[05:43.760 --> 05:49.800]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[05:49.800 --> 05:54.280]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go

[06:06.040 --> 06:10.600]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[06:10.600 --> 06:14.520]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've
[06:14.520 --> 06:19.240]  turned menace influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[06:19.240 --> 06:23.840]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[08:12.240 --> 08:19.760]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.760 --> 08:26.720]  alex jones believe me this is a radio broadcast that is going to be absolutely
[08:26.720 --> 08:32.360]  jam-packed with vital information for the future of the Republic and the world as
[08:32.360 --> 08:40.400]  a whole free humanity you do not want to miss this broadcast unspeakably important
[08:40.400 --> 08:47.480]  information is breaking by the minute by the minute I myself printed off more
[08:47.480 --> 08:54.800]  than 200 mainstream media articles from around the world this weekend and on
[08:54.800 --> 09:01.920]  Friday that clearly paint a picture of the New World Order in full retreat
[09:01.920 --> 09:06.080]  imploding in on itself that doesn't mean we're going to beat them this month or
[09:06.080 --> 09:10.280]  even this year next year but and it doesn't mean they won't counter strike
[09:10.280 --> 09:15.800]  with stage terror attacks and other operations but they're in deep trouble
[09:15.800 --> 09:21.800]  now I said in the last three weeks that I believe that the federal government is
[09:21.800 --> 09:26.080]  preparing to stage false flag terror attacks they've been caught doing it
[09:26.080 --> 09:29.200]  over and over again it's been declassified many times if you're a new
[09:29.200 --> 09:34.640]  listener look into the Gulf of Tonkin operation Ajax operation north woods and
[09:34.640 --> 09:44.120]  operation gladio to discover the declassified facts on cue and I said
[09:44.120 --> 09:48.040]  this three weeks ago with the underwear bomber I guess now a month ago that
[09:48.040 --> 09:52.280]  happened Christmas Day last month so a month ago that this was the signal that
[09:52.280 --> 09:58.040]  they would now have been lotten who's been dead since 2001 re-emerge as the
[09:58.040 --> 10:04.240]  boogeyman anyone can create a fake tape in Arabic put it on the internet a
[10:04.240 --> 10:08.400]  message board and they say it's been lotten there have been many cases where
[10:08.400 --> 10:14.160]  the mainstream media has been caught broadcasting hoax been lotten tapes it's
[10:14.160 --> 10:24.640]  been confirmed that at least six times in 2001 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 that the media
[10:24.640 --> 10:31.680]  would take old been lotten tapes 98 99 2000 2001 and just re-edit them and say
[10:31.680 --> 10:37.840]  they were new been lotten videos that's been confirmed it's been confirmed that
[10:37.840 --> 10:45.160]  the Intel Center the two directors of it it's come out we're both adjuncts to
[10:45.160 --> 10:50.640]  Donald Rumsfeld and CIA Pentagon black op propaganda they've been caught
[10:50.640 --> 10:56.400]  uploading al-qaeda videos with their Intel Center watermark in the same video
[10:56.400 --> 11:03.640]  layer as the al-qaeda graphics red-handed so we know these tapes are
[11:03.640 --> 11:08.640]  fake or their edits of old tapes now they've just moved on to completely fake
[11:08.640 --> 11:16.080]  audio tapes completely fake they never even say where they come from or they
[11:16.080 --> 11:19.520]  say they found them in a bunker in Afghanistan or they found them on a
[11:19.520 --> 11:30.040]  message board remember the guy who was it in 2004 did the fake beheading tape in
[11:30.040 --> 11:35.200]  San Francisco the media ran with it for two weeks we could create a fake be
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.840]  heading video in my office posted on the web the media would say it was real so
[11:39.840 --> 11:48.280]  think how easy it is for the CIA to do that now we're gonna be going over that
[11:48.280 --> 11:54.080]  today because bin Laden has reemerged that is the fake bin Laden and is saying
[11:54.080 --> 11:57.360]  he's going to attack us and they're simultaneously saying oh we've got
[11:57.360 --> 12:00.920]  record numbers of people on watch list trying to board planes from Europe the
[12:00.920 --> 12:06.800]  Middle East and Africa and Asia to come here absolute hype going on on that
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.080]  front they are clearly launching the preparatory phase and testing the
[12:11.080 --> 12:17.980]  waters sending up trial balloons to stage new terror attacks to legitimize the
[12:17.980 --> 12:25.040]  faltering fake fraudulent wars the wars of aggression the genocidal wars and to
[12:25.040 --> 12:30.240]  try to get Obama's approval rating up the lowest of any president one year into
[12:30.240 --> 12:36.760]  office he's one year and several days now into his one-year anniversary and
[12:36.760 --> 12:40.600]  remember I told you at the time those were fake terror alerts to try to get
[12:40.600 --> 12:48.820]  Bush's approval ratings up and as soon as it stopped working as soon as it
[12:48.820 --> 12:52.160]  started failing and his approval rating started dropping and as soon as the
[12:52.160 --> 12:55.960]  public said we know this is fake they came out and said okay it is fake and
[12:55.960 --> 13:00.040]  Governor Redge is now written a book the former head of Homeland Security saying
[13:00.040 --> 13:08.200]  it was all fake that's another fact that deniers of the reality out there can
[13:08.200 --> 13:13.480]  stick in their pipe and smoke so that is coming up later in the broadcast
[13:13.480 --> 13:24.160]  something even bigger than climate gate has now happened the head of the UN
[13:24.160 --> 13:30.000]  climate program from India has been caught involved in all sorts of huge
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.120]  business deals shutting down factories and then getting the money to relocate
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.520]  them to India he has now admitted that scores of reports by the UN on the
[13:39.520 --> 13:44.760]  Himalayan ice melt the list goes on I have a giant two inch stack just on the
[13:44.760 --> 13:48.880]  latest in climate gate and I told you climate gate was the equivalent of the
[13:48.880 --> 13:54.240]  boffin spies in Star Wars episode three episode four a new hope stealing the
[13:54.240 --> 13:59.320]  Death Star plans getting the information out of the public exposing all the
[13:59.320 --> 14:04.920]  previous hockey stick frauds and temperature reading frauds and Al Gore
[14:04.920 --> 14:09.800]  lying and Al Gore saying carbon dioxide went up and then heat goes up when it's
[14:09.800 --> 14:15.360]  actually the opposite temperature goes up and then carbon dioxide goes up that
[14:15.360 --> 14:19.640]  brought out all the old frauds that you and I knew about but that the general
[14:19.640 --> 14:27.400]  public didn't know about now Bill Santor is admitting in the mid 90s they took
[14:27.400 --> 14:31.420]  out five scientists in their official report that said man it's not affecting
[14:31.420 --> 14:35.240]  climate change and climate change is natural that's getting attention but
[14:35.240 --> 14:39.600]  all this new stuff is coming out everything that gets investigated has
[14:39.600 --> 14:43.640]  proven a fraud every university that gets investigated as part of this ring
[14:43.640 --> 14:49.440]  that's applied lies to the UN for the public I mean it's a huge stack they
[14:49.440 --> 14:53.520]  are imploding so now they've panicked and they're just coming out like it's no
[14:53.520 --> 14:57.600]  big deal hidden in plain view and saying okay we made mistakes the head of the
[14:57.600 --> 15:05.520]  IPCC says you know what we did want to make people be concerned about the
[15:05.520 --> 15:10.920]  environment and so we basically lied but still it's for a good cause I was
[15:10.920 --> 15:16.920]  talking to a reporter last night who was interviewing me for a magazine and I was
[15:16.920 --> 15:19.880]  talking about climate getting all the fraud he said but isn't the environmental
[15:19.880 --> 15:24.720]  movement good isn't it all basically for good and I said no it's not for good
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.080]  it's for grabbing property land the environmental movement that the media
[15:29.080 --> 15:33.560]  puts out is the corporate counterfeit of it are there real environmentalists that
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.120]  don't like killing all the whales which many species were almost extinct yes is
[15:38.120 --> 15:43.240]  there overfishing in many areas you need to rotate it like crops yes is
[15:43.240 --> 15:50.480]  genetic engineering cross species very dangerous yes is is the government of
[15:50.480 --> 15:55.360]  Russia in the US countless times dumping nuclear reactors in the ocean toxic waste
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.240]  you name it is that bad yes but but the main line environmental movement you see
[16:00.240 --> 16:06.840]  pushed by the NFL and the media and Fox TV one of the biggest culprits it is a
[16:06.840 --> 16:12.160]  land grabbing property rights destroying bandwagon that takes the real problems
[16:12.160 --> 16:15.200]  with the environment problem reaction solution and then gives a false
[16:15.200 --> 16:19.680]  solution but I wasn't going to get Lord Moncton on until he got back from
[16:19.680 --> 16:23.960]  Australia he's about to go to Australia I want to go ahead and put an email into
[16:23.960 --> 16:27.360]  him that I want to just get like a 30 minute update before he goes to
[16:27.360 --> 16:33.600]  Australia if he hasn't already left on his speaking tour there to discuss all
[16:33.600 --> 16:37.600]  these huge new developments and get his expertise on it he's also talking about
[16:37.600 --> 16:41.080]  he wants to come down to Texas being studio with us he's really a great guy
[16:41.080 --> 16:47.600]  so I don't want to spoil that event coming up but I don't know we can get
[16:47.600 --> 16:50.920]  Dillingpole on from the telegraph and some other people I mean I can obviously
[16:50.920 --> 16:54.280]  talk about it and break it down but it's good to have their their expert voices
[16:54.280 --> 16:59.280]  as well let's get the climate depot head on let's let me let's just set some of
[16:59.280 --> 17:03.080]  those up throughout the week because this is such a big deal having the Death
[17:03.080 --> 17:09.160]  Star plans isn't enough getting the information out and educating the
[17:09.160 --> 17:13.240]  public and and making it a major issue and calling for investigations into all
[17:13.240 --> 17:17.480]  of their fraud and reminding people of all the previous fraud that was blowing
[17:17.480 --> 17:22.000]  up the Death Star and it blew up at Copenhagen and we blew the Death Star up
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.720]  but we've still got the rest of the Imperial Fleet ladies and gentlemen
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.760]  superstar destroyers hundreds of star destroyers this is your movie analogy
[17:29.760 --> 17:34.160]  the Empire is still in our towns in our cities but they're now known to be a
[17:34.160 --> 17:40.520]  fraud they were caught in fraud on their flu hype they were caught in fraud on
[17:40.520 --> 17:44.880]  their WMD's they were caught in their fraud with a banker bailout baiting and
[17:44.880 --> 17:49.680]  switching saying it was for housing and not spending any any of it on that and
[17:49.680 --> 17:55.360]  keeping it for themselves they are losing any credibility they had with the
[17:55.360 --> 17:58.800]  public and the people are getting more and more mad by the second their
[17:58.800 --> 18:03.240]  health care fraud their health care hoax that it well I mean even if you're a
[18:03.240 --> 18:08.080]  socialist or a communist and that's why it finally is going down in flames the
[18:08.080 --> 18:11.880]  real collectivist who I don't agree with because any collectivism is immoral and
[18:11.880 --> 18:15.280]  ends up always amassing great power in the hands of the government the
[18:15.280 --> 18:21.480]  corporations to grow up around it and it creates favoritism nepotism corruption
[18:21.480 --> 18:26.800]  history shows that look what's happening now but even if you're for
[18:26.800 --> 18:31.000]  collectivism that's why Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich and others came out and
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.120]  said this is a giant fraud this health care is bad we may need to run somebody
[18:34.120 --> 18:39.120]  against Obama because the whole thing cuts Medicare and Medicaid by 40 plus
[18:39.120 --> 18:43.200]  billion a year per program it raises all these taxes puts you in jail if you
[18:43.200 --> 18:48.320]  don't get the insurance will shut down more industry people can't afford this
[18:48.320 --> 18:53.000]  folks many businesses can't afford it people that have even decent paychecks
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.160]  may not decide they want the health care or they may not want the health care
[18:56.160 --> 18:59.520]  government says they have to get I mean it's a moral issue of not being slaves
[18:59.520 --> 19:06.120]  to a medical tyranny and so that hoax is imploding and they probably won't even
[19:06.120 --> 19:09.240]  get it passed out of Congress now they've been having this Borg chant of it
[19:09.240 --> 19:12.960]  will pass you cannot defeat us it will happen it's a far gone conclusion it's
[19:12.960 --> 19:19.680]  not and so the entire system is in retreat right now and that's just a few
[19:19.680 --> 19:26.080]  of the issues I mentioned the problem is the public still doesn't know how bad
[19:26.080 --> 19:31.360]  it really is and isn't aware of all of the enemy operations if we can educate
[19:31.360 --> 19:35.840]  them about the different frauds and other hoaxes that are still going on we
[19:35.840 --> 19:40.280]  can beat those sunlight is the greatest disinfecting people say what's the
[19:40.280 --> 19:44.320]  solution states rights liberty teaching the Constitution Bill of Rights
[19:44.320 --> 19:50.160]  standing up for yourself cutting the size of government but overall if you
[19:50.160 --> 19:53.400]  educate the people as Thomas Jefferson said in the principles of liberty
[19:53.400 --> 19:59.760]  things will fix themselves now huge news coming up stay with us

[21:11.440 --> 21:15.160]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous
[21:15.160 --> 21:20.240]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[21:20.240 --> 21:25.640]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[21:25.640 --> 21:30.520]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[21:30.520 --> 21:34.920]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[21:34.920 --> 21:38.680]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists they're asking for more
[21:38.680 --> 21:42.600]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems
[21:42.600 --> 21:48.160]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[21:48.160 --> 21:53.880]  the Republic. Get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com

[24:22.600 --> 24:28.720]  Our opening salvo alerting people to Glen Beck and his past treachery against the
[24:28.720 --> 24:33.480]  freedom movement is up on prisonplanet.com it's titled Glen Beck for
[24:33.480 --> 24:38.680]  dummies. I am going to make a mini documentary in the next few weeks. The
[24:38.680 --> 24:42.680]  problem is I can only do so much work. I was up here again last night not
[24:42.680 --> 24:46.400]  complaining it's just I can only do so much and I tend to like somebody at a
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.080]  buffet put too much on my plate. I still need to write up the rules and
[24:52.080 --> 24:56.640]  sometime this week launch those contests that I said I was going to launch. We
[24:56.640 --> 25:00.640]  always launch contests when we say we will. We always do it so it takes a little
[25:00.640 --> 25:06.840]  bit longer especially when we get 300, 400, 500 videos to judge but that's work
[25:06.840 --> 25:14.560]  on the back end launching three different contests. My limited staff said
[25:14.560 --> 25:19.160]  thanks a lot Alex because they've got to at least even categorize and post all
[25:19.160 --> 25:22.800]  the videos and give them to me to watch but we're going to do that. That'll be
[25:22.800 --> 25:27.000]  probably it for contests at least for a while because again I've got to read and
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.400]  analyze the news. I've got to do media interviews. I've got to work on multiple
[25:30.400 --> 25:36.480]  films. We are trying our best here. I think we're doing a pretty good job
[25:36.480 --> 25:40.480]  thanks to all of you supporting us but Glen Beck for dummies. Beck is a fake
[25:40.480 --> 25:43.320]  revolutionary who was hijacked the freedom movement is being used to lead
[25:43.320 --> 25:51.480]  conservatives and libertarians down the rabbit hole. And so we're going to go
[25:51.480 --> 25:54.840]  over that article for you today. Obviously all the new bin Laden hype
[25:54.840 --> 26:02.360]  bin Laden claims airline bomb attempt on Christmas. He claims responsibility just
[26:02.360 --> 26:07.200]  I mean you could have somebody on a Mr. Microphone say they were bin Laden and
[26:07.200 --> 26:10.160]  they said in Arabic it would be true for the media. I'm going to break that down
[26:10.160 --> 26:17.280]  coming up. Pachari the head of the IPCC is openly it's being discussed you may
[26:17.280 --> 26:23.680]  have to resign. Criminal investigations are ongoing. We have just unbelievable
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.040]  amounts of fraud and corruption coming out and lies and fake data that dwarf
[26:28.040 --> 26:33.320]  Climate Gate and that's our hope was that we could get Climate Gate out there
[26:33.320 --> 26:38.360]  and that it would then expand and has greater than our wildest expectations
[26:38.360 --> 26:47.240]  and dreams. When you engage evil and don't stop you beat it. The problem is
[26:47.240 --> 26:51.600]  getting people to engage evil. Also coming up Mark Dice is out done himself.
[26:51.600 --> 26:57.000]  The video is up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and we're going to be
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.920]  playing it early in the next hour. He went around in San Diego on the beach
[27:03.920 --> 27:09.960]  front and got people to sign a petition to ban free speech and the first
[27:09.960 --> 27:20.880]  amendment and very few very few people were getting dice on Thursday. He works
[27:20.880 --> 27:24.520]  full time so he can't come until Thursday when he's got a day off. He works on the
[27:24.520 --> 27:31.040]  weekend. It's off Thursday and Friday. He'll be joining us but he's out done
[27:31.040 --> 27:35.920]  himself. I mean Mark Dice is just a fount of important research and work and
[27:35.920 --> 27:41.360]  the way he illustrates things is a example to us all. So my hat is off to
[27:41.360 --> 27:48.680]  Mark Dice through Patriot. I mean if mainstream television wanted to save
[27:48.680 --> 27:53.320]  itself as viewers leave it for the internet they would give people like
[27:53.320 --> 27:56.600]  Mark Dice a national TV show to do what he does but that would then defeat the
[27:56.600 --> 28:01.400]  new world order that owns the main television broadcasting systems and
[28:01.400 --> 28:04.440]  transmitting systems. They won't do that but I tell you people need to see
[28:04.440 --> 28:07.520]  stuff like this on national national television. Thanks for you think a
[28:07.520 --> 28:11.600]  pen and teller when they go out to environmental meetings and everybody
[28:11.600 --> 28:19.360]  agrees to sign a form to ban dihydrogen monoxide which of course is water H2O.
[28:19.360 --> 28:23.520]  We've done that ourselves. We've gone out. I've been on airplanes asked people
[28:23.520 --> 28:34.240]  should we ban table salt but I use the scientific name for table salt which is
[28:34.240 --> 28:40.120]  scary sounding and they say oh yes ban it immediately and that's what media is
[28:40.120 --> 28:46.080]  going off of is just how ignorant large segments of the population are.
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.840]  K.I. years ago ran a news piece that we played at Infinitum where they said
[28:50.840 --> 28:55.600]  mercury is good for children's brains and they've now outdone themselves with
[28:55.600 --> 29:01.400]  an attack piece on yours truly and on the second amendment and so that's coming
[29:01.400 --> 29:11.240]  up in the next segment. We've also got other police brutality reports here I
[29:11.240 --> 29:14.680]  mean if I wanted to make the police look bad the whole show would be about it
[29:14.680 --> 29:24.040]  every day. The video of a man walking down the street undercover cops jump out
[29:24.040 --> 29:28.760]  so he runs he's scared and they beat him and then taser him in the face he
[29:28.760 --> 29:32.600]  resists nothing and now they're charging him with attacking them. I mean it's not
[29:32.600 --> 29:37.120]  bad enough they almost killed the guy but then they charge you like that makes
[29:37.120 --> 29:44.720]  it okay for them psychologically just completely immoral. So we're gonna be
[29:44.720 --> 29:48.480]  going over the brutality charge as Pittsburgh police defend first strikes
[29:48.480 --> 29:55.440]  on teen it's all coming up. We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.440 --> 30:04.160]  and the GCN radio network. Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you

[31:06.080 --> 31:10.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this
[31:10.320 --> 31:14.480]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[31:14.480 --> 31:18.560]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[31:18.560 --> 31:23.280]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[31:23.280 --> 31:27.760]  as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the
[31:27.760 --> 31:31.920]  enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on
[31:31.920 --> 31:35.360]  destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[31:35.360 --> 31:38.160]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[31:38.160 --> 31:41.520]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[31:41.520 --> 31:44.640]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right
[31:44.640 --> 31:49.520]  now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[33:58.400 --> 34:02.240]  their fines and fees but it doesn't matter. Just look for the crowd.
[34:02.240 --> 34:06.080]  IH 35 and 8th Street. You cannot miss the giant
[34:06.080 --> 34:11.520]  police department facility. And the local group Texas for Accountable
[34:11.520 --> 34:14.560]  Government that's kicked this off John Bush.
[34:14.560 --> 34:18.160]  They're asking people to bring holsters with copies of the Constitution
[34:18.160 --> 34:24.240]  stuck in them. I'll be bringing my bullhorn. Now listen.
[34:24.240 --> 34:30.240]  Here's the deal. I want everyone to come down there.
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.400]  I want you to call your friends and family. I want gunstore owners to be there.
[34:34.400 --> 34:38.080]  I want people to defend the Second Amendment.
[34:38.080 --> 34:41.440]  And we're going to go over the latest chapter in the fraud
[34:41.440 --> 34:46.240]  of the ATF running this operation to destroy private transfer and sales of
[34:46.240 --> 34:49.680]  firearms in Texas to set a national precedent.
[34:49.680 --> 34:55.040]  They picked the pet client obedient Austin Police Department to carry this
[34:55.040 --> 34:59.840]  out with them. Listen. You guys can't pass laws.
[34:59.840 --> 35:03.200]  You can't get the laws passed to ban our Second Amendment private transfer.
[35:03.200 --> 35:09.840]  You call the gun show loophole an Orwellian term to imply that it's illegal.
[35:09.840 --> 35:14.080]  And no amount of hoaxes are going to work. I've been reading the comments on
[35:14.080 --> 35:20.720]  KI, on KXAN, on KVUE, the deceptive pieces they've been putting out.
[35:20.720 --> 35:24.720]  And it's just like your global warming hoax. It's just like your flu hoax.
[35:24.720 --> 35:32.080]  It's just like the healthcare hoax, your WMD hoax. It will not stand.
[35:32.080 --> 35:36.800]  90% plus of the commenters see right through your fraud and other facts.
[35:36.800 --> 35:40.560]  Every caller to talk radio is screaming and yelling with anger.
[35:40.560 --> 35:45.280]  I heard it going on this morning. Multiple stations.
[35:45.360 --> 35:48.560]  This got bigger than I thought it would in Austin. Our listeners really take
[35:48.560 --> 35:51.840]  action. This was just going to be a foregone
[35:51.840 --> 35:54.720]  conclusion. Wasn't in the media. No one was going to cover it.
[35:54.720 --> 35:58.160]  We put it out last week. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
[35:58.160 --> 36:06.080]  It blew up big time. And so the police, the ATF have come out with more lies.
[36:06.080 --> 36:09.600]  And that's not going to work for them. So I'm going to give you the latest on
[36:09.600 --> 36:13.760]  this right now. But first, of all the deceptive news
[36:13.760 --> 36:17.920]  pieces I've seen, and thank God people on YouTube are
[36:17.920 --> 36:21.520]  aggregating these, because I don't really watch local news unless there's a
[36:21.520 --> 36:25.840]  tornado or something or a hurricane coming in.
[36:26.480 --> 36:29.280]  I watch the news for the weather and I usually just check News 8 Austin for
[36:29.280 --> 36:34.960]  that. They're local weather online. But I've been sent
[36:34.960 --> 36:38.640]  four newscasts. Each one more deceptive than the last.
[36:38.640 --> 36:41.760]  Literally they get worse as it goes, as they get more desperate.
[36:41.760 --> 36:46.240]  And I would imagine there's more. I've been sent four.
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.040]  A News 8, a KVUE,
[36:52.640 --> 36:56.800]  a KI, and a Fox.
[36:56.800 --> 37:01.360]  And every one of the newscast says it's illegal to sell guns without a license
[37:01.360 --> 37:04.080]  and without papers. And what's the big deal?
[37:04.080 --> 37:07.920]  Police told them nicely to stop doing illegal things and
[37:07.920 --> 37:13.520]  aren't these gun nuts crazy that they don't want to follow the law?
[37:16.240 --> 37:19.520]  I mean that should outrage you even if you're an anti-gun person.
[37:19.520 --> 37:24.720]  Do you like having your intelligence insulted? The mainstream media knows
[37:24.720 --> 37:28.400]  what Mark Dyson, what I know. That probably 70% of the public
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.720]  doesn't even know what planet they're on. They know all about house and
[37:32.720 --> 37:36.160]  heroes and dancing with the stars and American Idol.
[37:36.160 --> 37:39.680]  But they have, the average American is like
[37:39.680 --> 37:46.320]  Miss Teen South Carolina. American citizens is education, helping such as
[37:46.320 --> 37:51.440]  in South Africa and to you, to me, helping.
[37:51.440 --> 37:56.480]  Remember her? In fact, later, queue up while you can.
[37:56.480 --> 38:00.720]  We're about to play clips, but queue up Miss South Carolina.
[38:00.720 --> 38:03.920]  Because people need to hear that. I mean Mark Dyson goes out at
[38:03.920 --> 38:06.960]  95%. I don't know, he probably talks to like
[38:06.960 --> 38:11.600]  15 people or something. Two of them say, oh, I don't want to
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.320]  ban free speech, but I do want to ban the Second Amendment.
[38:17.440 --> 38:20.560]  Hey, people are talking about Obama. Shouldn't we ban the First Amendment,
[38:20.560 --> 38:24.560]  free speech, and support the New World Order? Oh, absolutely. And they sign.
[38:24.560 --> 38:28.160]  Give their name, number, everything.
[38:28.720 --> 38:32.960]  And I mean, they read it. It reads like a joke. It says,
[38:32.960 --> 38:36.880]  so the world government can come in and Bilderberg can rule us. We must ban free
[38:36.880 --> 38:42.160]  speech in America. Oh, absolutely. I love Obama.
[38:42.160 --> 38:46.560]  What are those people doing illegally at that gun show selling guns?
[38:46.560 --> 38:50.000]  And the police are all over the newspaper and are pressurizing that we get 911
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.360]  calls because people would drive by on the highway
[38:53.360 --> 38:57.040]  above the Crockett Center. But that was politically incorrect. So they
[38:57.040 --> 39:01.360]  got rid of Davy Crockett's name. It's called the Market Center now.
[39:01.360 --> 39:04.400]  They've gotten rid of the names of high schools and middle schools all over
[39:04.400 --> 39:08.080]  Texas. Can't be called Crockett. It's evil.
[39:08.080 --> 39:14.000]  Alamo's evil. Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.360]  Can't have it. I mean, that's just everywhere is censorship. Everywhere has
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.640]  control, but side issue.
[39:21.040 --> 39:29.680]  The point here is that they know 70% of the population
[39:29.680 --> 39:34.640]  isn't as dumb as a box of rocks. They are just the simpering,
[39:34.640 --> 39:41.360]  weak, pampered, jellyfish-like.
[39:41.360 --> 39:44.480]  I mean, you want to see the people, Mark was talking to him. We talked to him this
[39:44.480 --> 39:46.880]  morning. I mean, that's who he talked to. That's who
[39:46.880 --> 39:50.400]  he could get to talk to. That's not him selecting out
[39:50.400 --> 39:54.080]  the majority of people being against free speech. That's, and they just, all of
[39:54.080 --> 39:59.200]  them look like sacks of soft, weak, and I don't even mean physically soft. They
[39:59.200 --> 40:02.480]  just look so doe-eyed and, and limp, and I said,
[40:02.480 --> 40:07.440]  yes, Ben, free speech. And imagine the same type of people here in Texas
[40:07.440 --> 40:10.800]  moving in here. They drive by a parking lot and see people with guns and they
[40:10.800 --> 40:17.520]  call 911 all day long. Just every hour calls are coming in.
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.480]  I saw an old man. I saw a family. That's some of the calls.
[40:22.480 --> 40:25.600]  You know, they'll see a family with kids. I saw him in with a gun. He had kids.
[40:25.600 --> 40:30.480]  They must be hostages. And every week I hear about a lockdown of a
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.120]  street in Austin or an area, and it always turns out some guy walks out with
[40:35.120 --> 40:37.520]  his deer rifle. Look, it's really bad during deer season.
[40:37.520 --> 40:41.040]  People call the police people with bows.
[40:41.040 --> 40:47.760]  I mean, I learned back in college that I was going to go to east Texas
[40:48.560 --> 40:54.560]  to do some hog hunting, wild hog hunting, and I went and got my deer rifle out,
[40:54.560 --> 40:57.280]  and I walked out right out of my apartment.
[40:57.280 --> 41:01.360]  My car was parked right in front of my apartment, popped the hatchback
[41:01.360 --> 41:06.160]  on the Mustang, green and gray Mustang, popped the back,
[41:06.160 --> 41:10.400]  lay the rifle in one
[41:11.200 --> 41:16.960]  package of Remington shells,
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.800]  and I drive to the store and I decided to come back because I'd forgotten some
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.400]  stuff, and I pull up and there's police there,
[41:26.400 --> 41:30.320]  and I instantly go, so I noticed they were right around in front of my
[41:30.320 --> 41:32.800]  apartment, and then I went and asked the apartment manager, what are the police
[41:32.800 --> 41:35.440]  to it? She says, oh, somebody saw somebody with a gun.
[41:35.440 --> 41:40.480]  You in America, folks, you in Texas
[41:41.760 --> 41:45.440]  can't walk to your car with your gun in rural areas. I've talked to family in
[41:45.440 --> 41:48.800]  east Texas now. If they're walking from their
[41:48.800 --> 41:53.600]  homestead a hundred yards down the road, that's normally how it is, you'll have a
[41:53.600 --> 41:56.800]  little house right on the road, then most of the time
[41:56.800 --> 42:00.480]  people's houses aren't right on their main piece of property.
[42:00.480 --> 42:04.160]  People generally try to buy a house on the road over the decades near their
[42:04.160 --> 42:07.040]  property, so it's almost never right on your property,
[42:07.040 --> 42:10.800]  and you're walking with a shotgun to go dove hunting, quail hunting,
[42:10.800 --> 42:14.240]  target shooting, and even in rural areas cops will pull up and say, what are you
[42:14.240 --> 42:17.360]  doing? Are you poaching?
[42:17.360 --> 42:22.880]  Or what are you doing with that gun? I mean, that's east Texas.
[42:22.880 --> 42:26.640]  They have gotten us to feel like we're dirty, we're bad, we're corrupt, we're
[42:26.640 --> 42:29.520]  evil, and now they're just saying, look, you're not going to have a gun show,
[42:29.520 --> 42:33.760]  people are scared of it, and it's against the law to sell guns without
[42:33.760 --> 42:36.560]  papers. If you're a federal firearms dealer, it is, but if you're a private
[42:36.560 --> 42:39.760]  citizen, you're allowed to sell your private guns.
[42:39.760 --> 42:46.320]  They don't have a law on that. What 16 states do? 12 of the states are very
[42:46.320 --> 42:52.080]  prohibitive, but 30 plus don't, and where I live is one of them, Jack.
[42:52.160 --> 42:55.280]  And again, that's what all the big billboards are about. I talk so much
[42:55.280 --> 42:57.680]  about this. For over a decade, you've all seen them.
[42:57.680 --> 43:01.280]  It'll show an image of a revolver,
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.440]  most of the time pointed at you, threateningly,
[43:05.440 --> 43:10.000]  and it'll say report illegal guns. Then in fine print,
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.840]  you've got to get up below, get out of your car, saw one in Galveston, took photos
[43:13.840 --> 43:17.360]  of it. I mean, I got 2020 vision, had to squint
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.200]  to read if guns used in the commission of a crime.
[43:21.200 --> 43:27.040]  So the police, the government, they know they're engaged in another hoax.
[43:27.040 --> 43:31.520]  They think you're so stupid that the federal government
[43:31.520 --> 43:36.000]  commissioned the New York Times eight months ago to write a fact sheet
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.920]  used in public schools, government buildings, medical institutions, and to
[43:39.920 --> 43:43.760]  be handed out at government approved. So they used it
[43:43.760 --> 43:47.280]  at Walgreens and everywhere else that says myths about the shot,
[43:47.280 --> 43:51.840]  cannot cause Guillain-Barre, cannot hurt fertility,
[43:51.840 --> 43:55.440]  cannot cause autoimmune problems, does not contain mercury. Now,
[43:55.440 --> 43:59.920]  you go over the actual insert and it says all of that, does cause Guillain-Barre,
[43:59.920 --> 44:02.960]  does cause neurological problems, can sterilize or hurt fertility,
[44:02.960 --> 44:07.360]  can cause autoimmune, and we put that out because we now have a big enough
[44:07.360 --> 44:12.320]  alternative media, myself and many others, and that hoax imploded.
[44:12.320 --> 44:16.240]  I mean, how many times can they lie to people? See, but they're still playing to
[44:16.240 --> 44:22.000]  that 70 percent that's now becoming 65 percent.
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.120]  In many areas of the country, the majority are awake,
[44:25.120 --> 44:28.720]  certainly not in Southern California. I mean, that's just a dead record
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.000]  in estimation. Our numbers are growing. Three percent
[44:32.000 --> 44:35.280]  started in one between three and five, the Revolutionary War.
[44:35.280 --> 44:38.880]  That's why there's groups called the three percenters.
[44:38.880 --> 44:45.920]  Now, we don't want a physical Revolutionary War, but we're not slaves, and we're not
[44:45.920 --> 44:49.200]  going to your FEMA camps, and you're not letting the CPS take our children
[44:49.200 --> 44:52.400]  outside the law, and we're not letting you shut down our gun shows, and we're
[44:52.400 --> 44:56.480]  done. Now, before I analyze this K.I. piece,
[44:56.480 --> 45:02.880]  here is the mercury piece. Literally probably for the 150th time I've
[45:02.880 --> 45:05.040]  played this. I mean, I haven't counted, but
[45:05.040 --> 45:08.800]  me regular listeners know I play this about every month, sometimes every week,
[45:08.800 --> 45:12.160]  and this was a national piece where they send out news packages and the news
[45:12.160 --> 45:14.880]  readers read it. This went out all over the country in local
[45:14.880 --> 45:18.720]  formats because they know you trust local news more than national.
[45:18.720 --> 45:22.560]  I found local news is much more deceptive because they don't get called on it as
[45:22.560 --> 45:26.400]  much as national news would. Here they are saying mercury's good for you,
[45:26.400 --> 45:30.960]  then I'm going to play their newscast from late last week attacking yours truly.
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.480]  Same outfit, they ought to be ashamed of themselves. Here they are saying something
[45:34.480 --> 45:36.320]  that'll kill your kids is good for them. Here it is.
[45:36.320 --> 45:40.880]  Mercury containing vaccines may have on kids. A life-saving device wins over the
[45:40.880 --> 45:44.800]  counter approval by the FDA. And sick of your glasses and contact lenses,
[45:44.800 --> 45:49.120]  a new corrective eye surgery is approved today. Here's tonight's medical headlines
[45:49.120 --> 45:53.520]  with medical watch reporter Seema Maverick.
[45:53.520 --> 45:58.400]  Mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies
[45:58.400 --> 46:01.840]  in the journal Pediatrics. There have been widespread concerns that
[46:01.840 --> 46:05.440]  mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological
[46:05.440 --> 46:08.640]  development of children. These new studies suggest that the
[46:08.640 --> 46:12.080]  offices that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved
[46:12.080 --> 46:16.240]  behavior and mental performance.
[46:16.240 --> 46:23.040]  Okay, so you heard that. Now we have this latest newscast from the
[46:23.040 --> 46:28.400]  same culprits, KI, and all the other news reports are almost identical.
[46:28.400 --> 46:32.880]  They're almost identical. And this clips up on infowars.com,
[46:32.880 --> 46:38.240]  prismplanet.com. It's also on YouTube if you want to watch it.
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.640]  And the clip is titled Austin Police and VATF Shutdown Legal Gun Show.
[46:44.640 --> 46:50.240]  That's the name that the YouTube channel gave it.
[46:50.240 --> 46:59.520]  Now, here it is. Another hoax. Listen to this.
[47:04.400 --> 47:07.760]  The illegal gun trafficking into Mexico may start
[47:07.760 --> 47:10.880]  here in our own backyard. Good evening. I'm Judy Mascio.
[47:10.880 --> 47:14.320]  And I'm Ronald Eveta. Austin Police tell us they've teamed up with federal
[47:14.320 --> 47:18.640]  officials to bust gun shows in Austin selling to convicted felons and
[47:18.640 --> 47:22.720]  undocumented immigrants. KI TV's Greg Watson is live in North
[47:22.720 --> 47:25.440]  Austin right now. So Greg, when did this happen?
[47:25.440 --> 47:29.040]  Okay, so now it's called a criminal sting. Now they say they're going to use a
[47:29.040 --> 47:32.080]  nuisance ordinance. And they were threatening to shut it
[47:32.080 --> 47:33.920]  down. Then they lied, so we didn't threaten to
[47:33.920 --> 47:36.400]  shut anything down. We didn't make them post that
[47:36.400 --> 47:39.920]  flyer. We didn't tell them what to write. Now they admit, okay, we said it was a
[47:39.920 --> 47:43.280]  nuisance and we shut it down. They ran off the last group, Saxon, that
[47:43.280 --> 47:48.000]  had been there for more than 15 years. A new group, Texas Gun Shows, comes in,
[47:48.000 --> 47:54.160]  takes it over. I mean, every 10 seconds is a lie in this. How do you even analyze it?
[47:54.160 --> 47:56.960]  They say there was an arrest made there. No, they didn't. They put somebody in a
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.520]  handcuffs who was innocent and marched him out and something was clearly staged.
[48:01.520 --> 48:06.480]  And then let him go. And they did it for the media they'd called.
[48:06.480 --> 48:10.000]  Now, again, a private seller is allowed to sell to whoever they want. It's not
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.200]  their job to know they're an illegal alien. But the illegal aliens, they're
[48:13.200 --> 48:16.000]  above the law. The police leave them alone on DWIs,
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  on every other issue. You know, don't take our rights because somebody else
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.960]  might be doing something wrong. See, because the way they write these laws,
[48:22.960 --> 48:25.440]  they've been trying to get passed in Texas and every other state.
[48:25.440 --> 48:29.840]  And some states have passed them is you can't take your dad's guns when he dies
[48:29.840 --> 48:33.920]  or when he goes to the nursing home. It's all got to be federally transferred.
[48:33.920 --> 48:36.720]  And then a lot of people won't even know this. This has happened in other states.
[48:36.720 --> 48:39.920]  Your dad will die or your mom will die. You'll get the guns.
[48:39.920 --> 48:42.560]  And six months later, you get a police raid on your house,
[48:42.560 --> 48:46.320]  shanty legal transfer of guns. That's what they want to pass.
[48:46.320 --> 48:50.000]  That's what this hoax is all about.
[48:50.160 --> 48:55.600]  Continue with the hoax. It gets worse. APD says about a year ago, the feds told
[48:55.600 --> 48:59.520]  them about unlicensed dealers and everyday folks selling guns here in this
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.600]  parking lot. Back it up a little. A year ago, when
[49:03.600 --> 49:08.400]  Obama got in, is when this new hype, and I told you last year,
[49:08.400 --> 49:12.400]  Attorney General Eric Holder said he would go after the Second Amendment
[49:12.400 --> 49:14.880]  and had to be restricted and gun shows had to be shut down. It was in the
[49:14.880 --> 49:18.320]  Associated Press. He gave a press conference on the border
[49:18.320 --> 49:21.840]  to stop guns into Mexico when the majority of guns in the studies are
[49:21.840 --> 49:24.960]  sold by the military to the cartels that are fully auto.
[49:24.960 --> 49:28.400]  Many Mexicans do buy firearms to protect themselves and you know what?
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.240]  I'm all for it. The Mexican people aren't allowed to own guns
[49:32.240 --> 49:35.760]  and that's why they live under tyranny. And let's continue with the hoax.
[49:35.760 --> 49:39.920]  Here in this parking lot of this event center, they said illegal gun sales were
[49:39.920 --> 49:44.000]  happening at a show here this past weekend. All right, let's pause again.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.880]  So now they're saying it's about the parking lot. No, the main issue, they
[49:46.880 --> 49:51.360]  made them do it inside and said old ladies couldn't come in and sell a gun.
[49:51.360 --> 49:54.960]  You go to the gun show, I'd say 80, 85 percent of people
[49:54.960 --> 49:58.320]  are licensed dealers. They got a bunch of guns. To be a full-time seller, you've
[49:58.320 --> 50:01.360]  got to get this license. But you see people with guns over their
[50:01.360 --> 50:04.400]  shoulders, shotguns that are broken, you know,
[50:04.400 --> 50:07.520]  open. People think that means broken. People that don't know about guns,
[50:07.520 --> 50:10.000]  broken over their shoulder, you pop them open and load them.
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.720]  You see people walking around and hey, I want to buy that. Where'd you get it?
[50:14.720 --> 50:17.680]  What's the deal? And then you sell it to them.
[50:17.680 --> 50:20.960]  And then the gun shows started discouraging that. So they said, hey, let's go
[50:20.960 --> 50:23.760]  out in the parking lot.
[50:24.480 --> 50:28.240]  And then what they do is the feds bring in illegal aliens
[50:28.240 --> 50:31.600]  who happen to be felons and they tell them, all right, you raped that girl.
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.720]  We're going to let you go, just we want you to go run some stings for us.
[50:36.720 --> 50:40.320]  And then they go and set up some farmer and they're going, yeah, it's a
[50:40.320 --> 50:45.920]  1957 shotgun. My brother give me. He bought it after he got out
[50:45.920 --> 50:50.640]  World War II. Would you like it, Pedro? Yeah, I'd like it. We're putting you in
[50:50.640 --> 50:54.960]  handcuffs, Bustard. What? It's not against the law for me to
[50:54.960 --> 50:59.200]  sell you a shotgun. You're going to jail, old man.

[52:08.480 --> 52:11.360]  history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[52:11.360 --> 52:14.320]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[52:14.320 --> 52:18.320]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[52:18.320 --> 52:23.040]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[52:23.040 --> 52:27.520]  as American citizens to pay attention. For all of the republic identifies the
[52:27.520 --> 52:31.680]  enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on
[52:31.680 --> 52:35.600]  destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[52:35.600 --> 52:39.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches
[52:39.440 --> 52:42.000]  and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.320]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC
[52:46.320 --> 52:51.520]  we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on

[53:03.760 --> 53:06.960]  thinking of calling a debt relief company? Don't.

[54:00.960 --> 54:04.800]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones
[54:04.800 --> 54:08.480]  on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:09.120 --> 54:13.440]  Okay, so going through this KI clip, just old deception. It's about to get a lot
[54:13.440 --> 54:15.920]  worse. Let's continue with them creating a
[54:15.920 --> 54:19.520]  hope to ban gun shows in Texas and nationwide run by the Justice
[54:19.520 --> 54:22.560]  Department. They admit the Justice Department's running all of this
[54:22.560 --> 54:25.920]  and the Attorney General promised to do this and they are doing it. Here it is.
[54:25.920 --> 54:29.520]  That's the weekend. Take a look at some video we shot at her earlier. As I tell
[54:29.520 --> 54:33.440]  you, the ATF told me this afternoon they arrested a man for illegal possession
[54:33.440 --> 54:36.560]  of a weapon here at the Texas Gun Show this weekend.
[54:36.560 --> 54:40.720]  They say he is from Mexico and by law can't purchase weapons in Austin.
[54:40.720 --> 54:44.320]  APD says the bigger problem is folks vendor shopping,
[54:44.320 --> 54:48.160]  meaning they go from dealer to dealer looking for someone selling guns without
[54:48.160 --> 54:52.800]  proper paperwork. Proper paperwork.
[54:52.800 --> 54:56.880]  Dealer shopping. People go in there for private sales. It's legal.
[54:56.880 --> 55:02.320]  See, they're on TV saying it's illegal. KI needs to be protested.
[55:02.320 --> 55:06.480]  Continue. They also watched his folks bought guns in the parking lot. Again,
[55:06.480 --> 55:10.240]  they say without paperwork. Police recommended the promoter only let
[55:10.240 --> 55:14.240]  licensed gun dealers in the shows and provide security for the parking lots.
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.000]  It falls. They didn't recommend they threatened to shut them down,
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.680]  which they now admit because I pointed out they had no law and they said, oh
[55:21.680 --> 55:26.240]  yeah, we've got nuisance abatement. The crack house law.
[55:26.240 --> 55:29.600]  Oh yeah. Continue. Police say they are enforcing
[55:29.600 --> 55:33.520]  not making laws. Lie. Most of the people who are
[55:33.520 --> 55:36.640]  trying to achieve legitimate sale of firearms or purchase firearms want a
[55:36.640 --> 55:39.120]  certain level of protection. They want to know that the gun they're buying is not
[55:39.120 --> 55:41.200]  stolen. They want to know the person they're selling to
[55:41.200 --> 55:43.840]  is not a convicted felon is not on parole for murder.
[55:43.840 --> 55:48.000]  And so having some way to do that is actually a benefit to everyone.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.480]  Head pause. Notice the detective vineyard knows there's no law.
[55:52.480 --> 55:56.160]  So in his press conference, he wouldn't say that. He just said, oh everyone wants
[55:56.160 --> 55:59.600]  this. It's a benefit. We're giving you something. It's for the children.
[55:59.600 --> 56:02.160]  Continue.
[56:02.960 --> 56:06.800]  Now, I talked to several people on the phone late this afternoon upset with
[56:06.800 --> 56:10.560]  APD. They say it is not a part of their job description.
[56:10.560 --> 56:14.400]  Ask police to say who can't and cannot sell guns.
[56:14.400 --> 56:18.000]  Head pause. That's our story. That's meant to sound insane.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.240]  Oh, there's not the police job to enforce the law and stop illegal guns.
[56:22.240 --> 56:27.520]  I mean, what's this country coming to?
[56:27.520 --> 56:31.360]  You know, arrest that old man walking out of his house with a rifle. Oh my gosh.
[56:31.360 --> 56:34.400]  Continue. We live here in North Austin tonight.
[56:34.400 --> 56:39.040]  Greg Watson, Tia TV News. ATF tells us there was a note placed on the
[56:39.040 --> 56:42.160]  event center door saying the fed shut down the show.
[56:42.160 --> 56:45.680]  ATF says it does not target gun shows, just people who sell
[56:45.680 --> 56:50.080]  illegally at gun shows. Another lie. Some of the illegal weapons ended up.
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.920]  They went to them, harassed them and harassed the landowner
[56:53.920 --> 56:57.920]  and shut it down. Another lie. Just how do you lie this much?
[56:57.920 --> 57:02.320]  Continue with the lies. In Mexico or even in the hands of convicted felons.
[57:02.320 --> 57:08.160]  Greg Watson has been following this story. What changes are ahead for this gun show?
[57:08.160 --> 57:12.400]  The promoter tells me future shows here at this location are canceled.
[57:12.400 --> 57:19.040]  About a year ago ATF and cuss. The promoter, no, the promoter and I talked to
[57:19.040 --> 57:24.640]  Darwin after he talked to K.I. He explained that the police harassed
[57:24.640 --> 57:28.000]  the owner of the building, the leaseholder, into kicking him out.
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.160]  But no, they say he just canceled it. See, we don't want to scare the public and say
[57:32.160 --> 57:36.560]  now it's just been shut down. No, the promoter, he decided to cancel it.
[57:36.560 --> 57:41.840]  Lie number, what is it? We should have counted the lies. 10, 12, 13, continue.
[57:41.840 --> 57:46.800]  Some agents told APD unlicensed dealers were selling guns in this parking lot
[57:46.800 --> 57:50.640]  outside a gun show. Police say some dealers inside that event center
[57:50.640 --> 57:55.040]  weren't asking for proper paperwork. The banner advertising the Texas gun show
[57:55.040 --> 57:58.880]  hangs above the door at the event center. But tonight the gun show promoters tell
[57:58.880 --> 58:03.680]  K.I. TV, the lease owner, ATB Grocery told them they couldn't come back.
[58:03.680 --> 58:07.600]  Oh, that, sir, you've got a civil rights lawsuit on the APD.
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.240]  Austin radio talk host Alex Jones spoke to Darwin Banneker on his calling show.
[58:12.240 --> 58:15.840]  He tells Jones it was another gun show last year, not his,
[58:15.840 --> 58:20.560]  that was allegedly selling guns without paperwork. This is assault. This is a robbery.
[58:20.560 --> 58:24.960]  Good pause. That's not what we said. It's legal to sell them privately without
[58:24.960 --> 58:27.280]  paperwork. So then they act like we're telling the
[58:27.280 --> 58:30.560]  live forum. They misrepresent what we're saying.
[58:30.560 --> 58:37.040]  And it just goes on and on and on and on. Everything they say is a lie, a
[58:37.040 --> 58:41.680]  distortion, a fraud, a hoax.
[58:42.160 --> 58:49.680]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.520 --> 58:55.520]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[58:55.520 --> 58:58.720]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[58:58.720 --> 59:02.720]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[59:02.720 --> 59:06.000]  Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence
[59:06.000 --> 59:10.000]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[59:10.000 --> 59:15.200]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[59:15.200 --> 59:19.200]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal
[59:19.200 --> 59:23.840]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[59:23.840 --> 59:27.600]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[59:27.600 --> 59:30.960]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[59:30.960 --> 59:33.760]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care.
[59:33.760 --> 59:37.280]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen
[59:37.280 --> 59:41.040]  a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic
[59:41.040 --> 59:45.920]  on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in

[59:51.040 --> 1:00:00.080]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:11.440]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:18.800]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from
[1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:23.440]  Austin, Texas. Alex Jones.
[1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:40.320]  Hour number two as we document the Justice Department of Barack
[1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:47.440]  Hussein Obama criminally going after legal lawful private sales at gun shows
[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:51.840]  and exploiting the public large portions of the public's ignorance
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:57.040]  about gun laws. It is legal for private sellers to go to gun shows and sell
[1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:00.240]  guns to each other. A full-time dealer that does it as an
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:04.880]  official business under federal tax law has to be registered.
[1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:07.520]  All over the country they've been pushing for decades to ban gun shows.
[1:01:07.520 --> 1:01:10.960]  They've been successful in 12 states, somewhat successful in several others.
[1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:14.160]  They're really trying to push this now and they now admit the Justice
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:18.720]  Department's running all this, but this KI piece just repeats lie after lie.
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:25.040]  They show video clips of my TV show from prisonplanet.tv
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:29.760]  and they imply, well just listen to it for yourself, here it is.
[1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:33.600]  Oh that sir, you've got a civil rights lawsuit on the APD.
[1:01:33.600 --> 1:01:38.320]  Austin Radio talk host Alex Jones spoke to Darwin Bedaker on his calling show.
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:41.920]  He tells Jones it was another gun show last year, not his,
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:46.240]  that was allegedly selling guns without paperwork.
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:52.400]  See, Darwin didn't say that. Darwin explained that they shut down the
[1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:55.360]  other gun show unlawfully and made them leave
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:02:00.400]  when it wasn't illegal. And the whole issue is there's no law.
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:04.400]  But then they, that's a trick they do. The reporter reports that
[1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:09.120]  we're angry about the other gun show was wrong, was bad, did break the law.
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:13.760]  No they didn't. They weren't bad, they didn't break the law. There is no law.
[1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:17.520]  But then that's a media trick where they say I'm angry
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:22.000]  because it was the other gun show that was breaking the law.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:24.880]  And then they cut to me as if I'm agreeing with it.
[1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:32.400]  It was another station in BC when we went and burned a UN flag in 1999.
[1:02:32.400 --> 1:02:35.440]  They then cut to file footage of somebody a year before at the Capitol
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:39.360]  burning an American flag and said that I was burning an American flag and I got
[1:02:39.360 --> 1:02:42.720]  so much hate mail. I was burning a UN flag,
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:46.080]  but they cut from me to a American flag burning.
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:49.920]  Now folks, I mean these people are deceptive and the same anchor
[1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:53.360]  was in NBC at that time. The same guy on KI
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:58.160]  putting out that propaganda is the guy now doing this. I mean these people
[1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:00.720]  never in, they never stop, continue with it.
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:06.000]  Oh this is a robbery. This is grand larceny sir. I feel the same way and
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.920]  the bad thing was that they said they told me well if you do this you'll get
[1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:14.240]  more license. You know that the federal fire license
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:17.680]  dealers in there, well actually I had two of my
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:20.560]  larges. That's a thought dealers actually
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:23.760]  canceled the day, the day before the show when I told them about it.
[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:27.920]  ATF agents arrested a man for illegal possession of a weapon at the Texas Gun
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:31.280]  Show. They say he is from Mexico and can't buy guns in
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:34.560]  Austin. APD says the bigger problem is folks vendor
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:38.240]  shopping, meaning they go from dealer to dealer looking for someone selling guns
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:41.760]  without proper paperwork. Police recommended the promoter only let
[1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:47.520]  license dealers in the show. They just repeat the same line
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:50.640]  that you've got to have paperwork, you've got to have paperwork, you've got to have
[1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:54.160]  paperwork. They think you're there like mushrooms to be
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:04:00.960]  kept in the dark and be shoveled horsemaner. They think you exist to be
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:04.080]  told by the same local news agency that mercury
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:09.280]  is good for your children. In a news package produced by CBS Broadcast
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:12.240]  Center in Manhattan, sent to them and they have a reporter read off the
[1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:16.000]  teleprompter to give it a local look. That was aired all over the country.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:20.800]  Mercury is good for your child and it's illegal
[1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:24.080]  for you to sell a gun to anybody without a license.
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:29.200]  A giant hoax. Hey, keep engaging in hoaxes. Obama is setting up the NSA
[1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:32.400]  cybersecurity takeover of the web openly saying he may start shutting down
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:35.600]  freedom on the web. That's CNET news, Associated Press.
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:39.440]  That won't even save you. You see, we're now here
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:42.560]  exposing your fraud, exposing your deception,
[1:04:42.560 --> 1:04:46.880]  exposing your hoaxes. And I'll tell you, KI
[1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:52.480]  is outrageous. I mean, this is an outrageous level of deception
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:55.680]  and they know exactly what they're doing.
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:05:00.480]  Mercury is not good for your children's brains.

[1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:07.680]  a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:11.440]  how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get.
[1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:14.720]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones,
[1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:18.800]  food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:22.800]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without
[1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:26.400]  proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:28.800]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:33.040]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all
[1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:35.680]  these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:39.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:43.520]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.

[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:06.400]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines,
[1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:14.000]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:19.200]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen. Eight minutes into the second hour. We're here
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:24.880]  Monday through Friday, 12 noon. Before p.m. Eastern, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:29.920]  Central Standard Time. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:34.800]  In the last hour, I went over the new fake bin Laden tapes. They've been forced
[1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:38.960]  to admit that past tapes have been fake. They're now bringing him back as the
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:42.960]  boogeyman to sell new wars, naked body scanners,
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:47.440]  police state domestically, I believe, with Obama's approval rating plunging,
[1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:50.480]  their entire agenda for the government takeover of health care,
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:55.120]  for new wars, for the flu hoax falling on its face,
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:08:59.840]  the Copenhagen global tax falling on its face. I've been saying for months
[1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:04.080]  that I believe they're getting ready to launch a new false flag terror attack.
[1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:08.800]  That is coming up later in the broadcast. We're going to be breaking that down.
[1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:14.240]  Also, we've got just incredible video and photos of new
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:19.600]  police brutality, breaking arms, breaking legs, beating people half to death.
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:27.520]  For no reason on video and then charging them, charging them with assaulting the
[1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:33.040]  police, a new level of corruption, a new level of open tyranny and evil.
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:35.440]  They don't even care if you have video of it. It's clearly a fraud.
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:38.400]  They're that secure in their criminal activity.
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:42.480]  So we're going to be going over that as well. Obviously, in the last hour,
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:47.680]  I spent the lion's share of our time together going over the fact that the
[1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:50.560]  Justice Department admits they're running a nationwide program, particularly in the
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:54.400]  border states, under the guise of stopping weapons trafficking into Mexico. Problem
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:58.320]  reaction solution. Though most of the guns are sold to the drug cartels
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:02.160]  by the military and the police, and that's on record. They're fully automatic.
[1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:05.920]  A lot of Mexicans are buying guns here to go back to Mexico to protect themselves.
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:09.200]  Mexico has total gun ban for citizens. You notice they have one of the highest
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:13.840]  crime rates in the world and are on the verge of collapsing. Also, drugs are illegal there.
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:18.960]  That drives up the price. Drug prohibition is what is allowing this to happen.
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:25.520]  But they're through a hoax saying that private gun sales are illegal. Earlier,
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:29.520]  I played a KIP's from here in Austin that was completely twisted and said the police
[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:33.760]  are just enforcing the law. There's illegal gun sales going on. You've got to sign paperwork
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:38.400]  and go an FFL dealer to buy guns. They've passed laws in many other states. They're
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:45.600]  trying in Texas to, quote, get rid of the gun show loophole. And what they do with that
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:50.960]  is the way the laws are written in other states, what they've tried to pass in Texas.
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:57.840]  Since 2000, they've tried over and over again. What they're trying to do is pass laws where
[1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:04.800]  a grandfather can't give his grandson a.22 rifle. They're trying to pass laws where your
[1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:08.960]  father dies and you can't be given his guns. It's got to be gone through the feds and transferred
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:14.400]  to you. That's the gun show loophole. Private sales of guns. I can sell my neighbor a gun.
[1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:19.280]  I can sell one of my employees a gun. They can sell me a gun. You've seen the federal
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:25.920]  regulation that pull up that article for me. Prison time for garage sale. A list of tens of
[1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:30.400]  thousands of recalled items. You have no idea what's going on. The feds are deputizing local
[1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:36.720]  police with special units to harass bazaars, flea markets, garage sales. They're busting people
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:41.760]  all the time at garage sales, selling a couple of their guns. This is illegal what they're doing,
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:46.160]  but the news all over the country is running hoax reports. It's now national news, what happened
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:49.840]  in Austin, where they shut down the Austin gun show. First, they denied that. Now they said
[1:11:49.840 --> 1:11:54.880]  they did it through nuisance abatement or the crack house law. So we're going to be breaking
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:12:03.280]  that down more. And I want to just remind listeners that I get so tied down. That's
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:10.000]  McClatchy newspapers. Feds cracking down on garage sales. Try to give me the Fox one, where it
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:20.320]  actually says jail time for garage sales Fox news. Or garage sales Fox news. The search should
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:23.760]  put it all, pull it up. People won't believe that unless they actually see the articles. That was
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:31.600]  McClatchy there. Okay. We need to stand up against this. We need to say no to this. And
[1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:38.480]  there's a bigger issue to just the second amendment and them shutting down the gun show
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:48.880]  as a case point example. And that is that they did this without a law and the media now is engaged
[1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:56.880]  in a hoax saying it was the law. So the police under federal control and our Ace of Aida obviously
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:02.160]  supports this. The police chief are just saying, we don't care. We're going to do what we want to
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:06.880]  do. We don't care. We can't pass this through the legislature. So we're just going to do this. And
[1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:11.440]  the attorney general needs to get involved with what's happening in Austin because the police
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:16.160]  are quote the authorities. And if they just start making stuff up, and I know a lot of police
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:19.840]  officers are upset about this. I've got a lot of emails from Austin police phone calls from Austin
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:25.120]  police. We've had calls from police all over the country. They don't like this. A national polls
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:29.760]  98% and a police survey a few years ago, believe in the second amendment, believe we need less
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:36.400]  laws, not more. So there are a lot of good police out there, but there are a lot of bad ones being
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:41.360]  protected and bad ones being promoted. And so I don't want to paint with a broad brush here,
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:47.520]  but the leadership is bad and is out of control. And our Ace of Aida may think that he can have
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:52.800]  warrantless checkpoints for blood. He couldn't. He went to the legislature, gone to pass a law.
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:56.640]  They could take blood without warrants, but I've talked to local judges and others. They say it
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:14:01.120]  will be overturned by the Texas Supreme Court, but at the time being he's out there and he really
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:05.680]  believes, you know, that we'll save some people if we do this. It doesn't matter. You don't go down
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:12.160]  that road. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Now going back to police chief, aren't
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:20.320]  Ace of Aida and the fact that we're going to be protesting tonight down at the Austin police
[1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:25.440]  department, local Austinites have organized this five to seven PM. I'm going to be there
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:32.240]  in front of the Austin police departments, 715 East 8th street, IH 35 and 8th street. If you live
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:40.720]  outside Austin, you come down right down at 35, you take the 11th to 6th street exit, you get off.
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:47.680]  It's on the west side of the highway and there's plenty of parking underneath the
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:53.440]  overpass there, free parking. There's also meters if you want to pay or can't find parking.
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:59.280]  You park, get there at five. The media will attempt, because they have a playbook on fooling
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:04.800]  people and lying, they enjoy it, the power trip. They will try to show up at 430 and only shoot
[1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:09.280]  five or six people, only videotape five or six people and say that was the protest. It won't
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:15.440]  matter if we have 500, but we now can expose them and they're listening right now, but it's not
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:21.280]  going to work. That's the great thing. They keep acting like the internet isn't there and that's
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:28.080]  why they're destroying themselves. So you watch, I'm calling it now. The media will be there.
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:33.680]  They will show up before five. They will shoot their piece when 10 people are there. They will
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:40.480]  leave. They will not show 200, 300, 400 people. That will be another lesson to you in media fraud,
[1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:45.200]  media corruption, how they operate. You saw them early on in the Tea Party say, oh, it's just a
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:50.720]  few people, a few hundred. And it was 200,000. And then another one, they said there was 100,000
[1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:56.320]  and there was more like a million. And that's what the DC police said. Or they said Republican,
[1:15:56.320 --> 1:16:03.680]  early last year, Republicans were financing the entire Tea Party and that became a self-fulfilling
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:09.520]  prophecy as the Republicans did actually take it over. But at the time, Governor Rick Perry,
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:13.280]  Senator Cornyn here in Austin would go to Tea Parties and be booed off the stage.
[1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:17.600]  And I tried to make that point. Then the Republicans did come in and take over a lot of it,
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:22.400]  but it was Ron Paul movement, the 911 truth movement before him that started the Tea Parties.
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:33.120]  So we're going to be going over that today. I'm going to be there from about 430 until 7 o'clock
[1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:43.600]  tonight. Everybody needs to come out to this event. If the feds, sin provocateurs, I'm going to expose
[1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:47.120]  you. That may make them not come because I'm going. That's the main reason I've got to go.
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:52.880]  Because I'm going to identify you and I'm going to neutralize you with my video camera.
[1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:59.040]  I'm going to neutralize you. I'm going to expose you. So just, I know you're coming. We're going
[1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:03.040]  to be there. I'm going to have cameras on me 24 seven if one of their hired anarchist tries to
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:07.840]  attack me or something. That's who works for them. But we're going to be there. We need everybody
[1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:12.240]  in strength. This is the Alamo folks. This is where they're going after the Second Amendment,
[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:18.000]  right here in the land of Colonel Travis. They are going after our precious Second Amendment.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:26.320]  And I want to see everybody there tonight. The police department is straddles 8th Street and
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:32.000]  6th Street. It's in between 8th Street and 6th Street right off 535 on the west side. You cannot
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:37.680]  miss it. Now, one local group involved in kicking this off, Texas for accountable government,
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:44.080]  that has a lot of great work I've noticed. They're saying bring holsters with copies of the
[1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:52.080]  Constitution and just the holsters alone will scare the media to death. These people are so
[1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:57.600]  pathetic how domesticated they become. But yeah, I'll be there handing out evil pocket
[1:17:57.600 --> 1:18:03.840]  constitutions as well. And the police are taught that those are basically illegal. You don't believe
[1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:07.840]  me. I know that sounds asinine. We have Abby Newman pulled over to checkpoint. They find a pocket
[1:18:07.840 --> 1:18:11.600]  Constitution. The police start breathing heavy and go, oh my God, we've got an extremist. We've
[1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:16.240]  got contraband and they start asking the other commander, is this legal? And he says, I think
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:21.920]  she's allowed to maybe have that. The good guy thinks maybe she's allowed to have a pocket
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:29.600]  Constitution. That's on video. So that's what these people have turned into. Now, it's not
[1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:34.880]  just the second amendment that's under attack. It's also the first amendment. Coming up later
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:38.240]  in the hour, I'm going to play this Mark Dice video. I think his most powerful work to date.
[1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:41.600]  Mark's working right now. He can't come until Thursday, but we'll have him here.
[1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:46.560]  And all of you could do the type of things Mark Dice does. And his videos get hundreds of thousands
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:52.400]  in some cases, millions of views. And he's just another tireless defender of liberty.
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:57.600]  And we suggest people buy his books and materials that we sell at infowars.com. But that's coming
[1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:01.600]  up. I think we're an hour and 19 minutes in the broadcast. I haven't plugged the online

[1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:10.880]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[1:21:11.680 --> 1:21:15.680]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've determined to have this
[1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:21.920]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:27.840]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the
[1:21:27.840 --> 1:21:34.000]  enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:38.880]  ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:43.520]  more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody
[1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:50.560]  does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of
[1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:57.760]  Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:06.480]  at prisonplanet.tv. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers,
[1:22:06.480 --> 1:22:12.160]  investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA? That's right, gold has been available to be
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:19.200]  placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real
[1:22:19.200 --> 1:22:25.120]  hard assets for your retirement. The truth be told, gold and silver is outperform paper investments
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:31.360]  like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs. Perhaps the financial institutions want
[1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:36.160]  to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper. If you'd like to take a look at
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:43.680]  gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return
[1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:53.920]  on your paper investments. Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237.

[1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:11.360]  I'm going to news blitz coming up into the next hour. Then we're going to get into the
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:16.640]  flu hoax that's completely collapsed. But it's like the climate gate emails opening up a whole
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:22.000]  world of fraud and hoaxes by the UN and those that want world government setup and Americans
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:26.960]  to have to pay taxes to the IMF and World Bank and UN. We need to take this information and get
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:33.600]  it out to people just like with the climate gate with the flu gate. And so Mike Adams joins us
[1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:40.960]  in the next hour on that important front. We do have a gun shop owner joining us.
[1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:47.440]  Remember a few months ago we got the flyers and confirmed that tattoo shops, feed stores,
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:51.920]  everybody are being asked, does somebody have burns on their hands? Are they buying chemicals?
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:57.680]  Are they buying fertilizer? Are they getting tattoos of, you know, patriot type stuff? Report
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:01.840]  them as a potential terrorist. Getting Americans used to being spies. And again, most of the
[1:25:01.840 --> 1:25:07.600]  terrorists staged, if not all. So it's setting up the police grid. Well, now gun shops all over
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:15.680]  the country have been given FBI manuals and they're told you will follow this or the BATF will
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:20.720]  shut you down. And I want to go over the list of things. This is how they're going after the
[1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:26.480]  Second Amendment. They're using covert intelligence operations to do this. So here's a newscast on
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:32.640]  that. Appearing to be from the FBI has been turning up at local gun and ammo shops, instructing
[1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:38.000]  employees there on how to identify suspected terrorists. But some store owners say that its
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:43.520]  regulations might affect more than just enemies of the state. 4029's Kyle Kubody found out today
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:49.360]  why the flyer might cause problems for regular customers. The flyer is designed to keep guns
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:54.880]  like this one out of the hands of suspected terrorists. Alright, pause. See equating guns
[1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:59.920]  with terrorism, having gun buybacks for the image people handing their guns in as if that's normal.
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:04.960]  We've confirmed the flyer's real. We've called the phone number. The FBI admits they put it out.
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:08.320]  This is one of the earlier newscasts. So this really happened. Continue.
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:14.560]  Restics like insisting on paying with cash only or purchasing large quantities of ammunition or
[1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:20.960]  other gun accessories store. Back it up a little. Remember all the mainstream news stories about
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:28.880]  man visited by FBI visited by ATF because he bought 500 rounds of ammo man rated because he
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:33.600]  bought four guns. You've seen all those articles last year and this year. I see him every week.
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:39.040]  See, this is what's going on. Also, knock and talk. VATF randomly going to houses,
[1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:44.400]  knocking someone to talk about your guns. There's a giant operation going on to intimidate people
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:48.160]  into not being part of the Second Amendment Liberty culture and to create the perception
[1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:53.680]  that guns are illegal. Continue. Accessories. Store owners are also supposed to look for
[1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:58.480]  people with missing hands or fingers, chemical burns or stains on their clothing. Generally,
[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:04.640]  this whole thing is a customer, my customer base, probably the customer base of most all your gun
[1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:10.000]  shops. Jim Snow, owner of Rebel Arms and Sporting Goods in Nob Hill, says the form's definition
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:14.800]  of a terrorist is debatable. Well, that's generally what a gun owner is. He's buying
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:22.640]  a bipod for his rifle. He's buying handgun ammunition. He wants a container to keep it safe in.
[1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:27.200]  He says he isn't comfortable using that criteria to profile people in his shop,
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:32.960]  especially when many are longtime customers. They're wanting kids to turn their parents in.
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:38.720]  They're wanting parents to turn their kids in. Ron Garrett from GI Guns and ammo and Rogers
[1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:43.040]  doesn't see the point of the flyer. I think that's probably a little bit of overkill.
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.680]  He says all potential gun buyers are subject to background checks by the FBI already.
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:53.200]  And that form gives us their basic information, their name, address, date of birth, description
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:59.040]  and so forth. And the FBI has the right to deny a sale if the background check doesn't add up.
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:04.000]  Even with any regulations, gun store owners we talk with said they'll always be careful about
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:11.680]  who they sell to. In Rogers, I'm Kyle Cabot. So see, it isn't enough. You go through an
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:17.280]  instant background check when you go to an FFL dealer. These are rural areas they're targeting
[1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:22.640]  mainly with this. And they're in there saying, are they buying a bipod? Are they buying a container
[1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:27.520]  for ammo? Are they missing fingers? You know how many farmers and ranchers are missing fingers?
[1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:33.200]  I mean, you go to some farm meeting and I bet one out of 10 people are missing fingers,
[1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:39.760]  missing arms from working on those combines and tractors working with their saws.
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:45.040]  You know how many people have burns on their hands at work on farms?
[1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:54.240]  I mean, I've bought bipods. I've got bipods. Does that mean I'm a terrorist?
[1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:59.520]  But again, there's also another lie in the piece that the FBI has the right to deny that
[1:28:59.520 --> 1:29:06.480]  doesn't add up. No, if it says you're a felon, but now outside of the law, they're saying,
[1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:11.840]  oh, if you've got a restraining order against you that's standard in a divorce, even if it's not
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:16.480]  for violence, you have to turn your guns in. Again, and then we've had court cases where
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:22.480]  they said that's unconstitutional. The VATFE, the ATF, they don't stop. They don't quit.
[1:29:23.200 --> 1:29:27.600]  They never stop. We're going to talk to Jim Snow for about five minutes coming up.
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:31.280]  He's one man shop. They're going to be busy with people in his store, but he can give us five
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:35.280]  minutes on the other side and tell us specifically what he means about they want us to turn in
[1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:41.280]  our parents, turn in our children, because that is in other FBI training flyers that we've
[1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:47.840]  covered and broken here on air. Remember what the MYAC and Homeland Security Report says, gun owners
[1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:54.000]  are the number one enemy of the government. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.800 --> 1:30:02.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the

[1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:04.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:09.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:31:09.040 --> 1:31:14.080]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:19.680]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:31:19.680 --> 1:31:24.800]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:30.080]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:34.720]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:40.080]  weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:44.480]  peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:31:44.480 --> 1:31:50.400]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:08.400]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you
[1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:14.320]  want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:19.600]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:24.800]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:28.880]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[1:32:28.880 --> 1:32:33.360]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:38.960]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:44.240]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:52.160]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out
[1:32:52.160 --> 1:32:58.880]  on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:28.080]  All over the country, tattoo shops, fertilizer shops, regular businesses, they're given these
[1:33:28.080 --> 1:33:33.680]  flyers. But the gun shops we've confirmed, we've called the FBI, all over the country are being
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:38.560]  given these flyers saying, is somebody buying a bipod? Are they buying a lot of ammo? And we've seen
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:44.800]  the news reports all over the country. We've covered them here where somebody buys 500 rounds of ammo
[1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:51.440]  and the ATF visits them. And they come with warrants and search your house. So they're creating a
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:56.160]  perception that guns are dirty and bad. Just like the big billboards that say, report illegal guns,
[1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:00.480]  show an image of a revolver when revolvers aren't illegal. They're creating this perception.
[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:05.200]  And Jim Snow is in Rogers, Arkansas. He owns a gun shop there. He's running it alone today, so
[1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:10.480]  can't be with us long. I wanted to get him on specifically about this flyer. Sir, good to have
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:15.600]  you with us. Good to be with you. Actually, I'm in Springdale, Arkansas. Okay. Well, the article
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:22.960]  says Rogers. Is this Springdale right outside it? No, no, Rogers is next town over. There was two
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:27.760]  of us on there. One from Rogers and I'm from Springdale. Got it. I was just reading off the
[1:34:27.760 --> 1:34:35.520]  headline from the local TV station. Okay. Now, when did you get this flyer or other gun shops
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:38.880]  got it? The media came and asked you about the flyer. What do you think about the flyer?
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:48.800]  Well, if you read the flyer, it's pretty much covers just about everybody that would be coming
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:54.800]  to buy a gun at a gun shop. You know, just because they've got some fingers missing or a hand
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:35:02.480]  missing arm, you get people like that all the time. People pay with cash. Most gun shops would
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:11.440]  rather have cash than a credit card or a deck. It's easier to process. This is one of those
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:16.000]  things that they put out that doesn't make a lot of sense. Unless you're wanting to demonize,
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:19.840]  unless you're wanting to demonize a good Americans, did you see the Mayak and Homeland
[1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:24.000]  Security reports that came out last year where Homeland Security said they were really
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:28.720]  gearing up to go after American returning veterans, gun owners, conservatives, Ron Paul supporters?
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:34.800]  Right. That's where this came from. I'm pretty sure, you know, I don't know what it is,
[1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:40.400]  but that's where I think this came from. Absolutely. Now, expanding on this, they
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:45.840]  briefly quote you on television. Well, they have video of you saying they want kids to report on
[1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:49.920]  their parents, parents to report on their kids. What does you mean by that? Well, that's what
[1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:55.920]  they're trying to get us to do. They're telling kids in school to tell them they're folks for
[1:35:55.920 --> 1:36:01.200]  having guns in places where they're not supposed to have them. Things like that. They're trying to
[1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:07.120]  get parents to turn their kids in because they're kids like them. It just reached a point where
[1:36:09.120 --> 1:36:14.560]  the government doesn't seem to be supporting the American way of life. They're trying to
[1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:21.120]  support some other way of life that doesn't exist here and hasn't existed here ever.
[1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:28.080]  You're absolutely right, sir. Right here in Austin, they train kids to report on parents'
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:33.760]  illegal guns. And then the kids think all guns are illegal. I had a carpet cleaner a decade ago
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:39.680]  from out of state. He saw a shotgun on a rack in my house and tried to call the police. He thought
[1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:45.520]  he'd found a terrorist and they just shut down the Austin gun show because the police said people
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:50.080]  driving by were scared by people walking in with guns. I mean, America's come to the point where
[1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:56.800]  you can't have guns in your pickup rack. I mean, they really are creating the perception
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:03.680]  that guns are like child pornography. I remember several years ago when I was in high school,
[1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:10.560]  we'd take our guns to school on the bus to go home to friends and go hunting. My father, too.
[1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:15.520]  Yeah, you carry them in the gun rack. You don't see guns in gun racks anymore.
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:22.080]  In most of any place you go to, we're back out in the country somewhere, maybe you do, but not
[1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:29.760]  as a normal rule. So they have intimidated our movement, our freedom down to almost nothing.
[1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:33.440]  Did you hear they shut down the Austin gun show? No law, they just did it.
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:41.200]  No, I hadn't heard that. We had a gun show here in Springdale this weekend. Nobody shut it down.
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:45.840]  Well, you're a federal firearms dealer yourself because that's what you do as a business. It's
[1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:51.120]  a tax issue. Here's the ATF Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives unlicensed
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:56.560]  person questions. To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms? We're also on TV right now,
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:37:59.760]  sir. I'm going to put that up on screen. I want to read this and get your take on it and we'll
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:07.360]  let you go. To whom it may concern. To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:13.760]  GCA? And again, we're going to put that ATF document up on screen. A person may sell a firearm to
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:18.560]  an unlicensed resident of his state if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the
[1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:25.040]  person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under federal law. So again, I can sell
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:31.840]  my cousin a gun and my grandfather could give me a gun like he did, just like he'd give me a fishing
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:37.440]  pole. But in Austin, the police chief and the ATF say Obama has said no more sales at gun shows
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:42.640]  from private people and they just shut it down. This is huge national issue.
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:49.120]  That's the strange thing. I hadn't heard of anything like that happen.
[1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:52.240]  I suppose it can if people let it happen.
[1:38:53.760 --> 1:38:59.440]  Kim. Well, Mr. Snow, we've got you here today. I mean, is this upsetting locals that in your
[1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:03.760]  schools, they're training the kids to spy on the parents and the FBI's got flyers saying if
[1:39:03.760 --> 1:39:07.840]  somebody's missing a finger. I mean, how many, I've been in so many gun shops when veterans come
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:11.920]  in with arms and legs blown off buying guns. I guess we're supposed to call the police on them.
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:16.720]  Anybody who does any hog hunting or coyote, you know, getting rid of nuisance animals
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:22.000]  uses a bipod at night if they know what they're doing. I mean, I guess that's just all terrorism.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:29.920]  It seems to be that's the way our government is trying to portray us. You know, we've got an
[1:39:29.920 --> 1:39:36.880]  election year now, November. We can go to polls and vote out all of those politicians that don't
[1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:42.320]  seem to understand the American right. The Constitution, the First Amendment or the Second
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:48.640]  Amendment. A lot of them don't seem to understand either one of them. If the Supreme Court, if
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:56.240]  you remember a couple of days ago, turned that turned down the fine. What was it? The McCain
[1:39:58.160 --> 1:40:05.600]  Fungo Law that prohibited corporations from advertising spending money a certain amount
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:11.440]  of time before a general election. They found that unconstitutional. Again, that was the
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:20.400]  Republicans passed that. That's the sad thing is the Patriot Act also is passed by the Republicans
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:26.960]  and that's one of the most repressive constitutional laws that we've ever had passed against our
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:32.880]  rights as Americans. And Obama is continuing it. You own rebel arms, sportings goods, sir?
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:36.960]  Yes, sir. Tell folks how they can visit you there in Arkansas.
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:48.880]  Uh, out east of Springdale, about 10 miles on Highway 412 East, 20088 Highway 412 East.
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:54.080]  Well, we appreciate you speaking out against this demonization, this Soviet style,
[1:40:54.080 --> 1:41:01.760]  Nazi style demonization of gun owners. In closing, a lot of gun dealers are being shut down.
[1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:06.720]  A lot of cities don't even have a gun shop anymore. They harass them. If a T isn't crossed and I
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:11.280]  isn't dotted, they literally harass you out of business. Have you had any of that go on or are
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:17.040]  you aware of that happening in your area? Uh, nothing that I know of around here. They treat
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:24.480]  us pretty good. So far, nobody that I know of had any problems. If you do the, if you do the
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:29.680]  paperwork right, follow the laws, you shouldn't have any problems. But again, you as a federal
[1:41:29.680 --> 1:41:36.560]  firearms dealer, no, it's legal in almost every state. For somebody to privately, they've got a
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:44.480]  few guns, go to a gun show and sell those. Yes, that's our law. We can buy, trade and sell our
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:50.960]  own property the way we want to. Did you hear about federal regulations where they're saying
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:57.520]  over 10,000 recalled items, five years in jail, 500,000, the next time a million dollar fine,
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:04.880]  if you have a garage sale, I hadn't heard that mainstream media, they want to shut down private
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:10.080]  sales. They want to make you go to a big box Walmart. Have you read about Walmart making
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:16.720]  people registered to buy ammo? Uh, no, they shouldn't be doing that. I've never heard that. That was
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:23.280]  a, that was in law up till about the 70s. But that law was repealed a long time ago.
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:30.800]  Well, they're doing it again in Texas and all over the country. Are your customers upset by this
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:35.520]  that, that the, that the feds are asking you to report them if they're missing a finger or
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:42.560]  if they buy a bipod or a ammo? Oh, yeah. And the more they find out about it, the more the
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:47.680]  problems there's going to be with people not wanting to come to gun shops because of that.
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:53.600]  Or if you had our day, Savannah, our police chief, he'd just say, you're shut down because he's
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:43:00.400]  God. Okay. Well, Mr. Snow, I really appreciate you spending time with us. Jim Snow joining us
[1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:06.080]  from his gun shop in Arkansas. We appreciate you standing up to these guys. And so, so
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:11.360]  you're not going to report people buying ammo at the gun shop? No, why would I do that?
[1:43:11.360 --> 1:43:13.440]  It's not against the law. He's by what they want.
[1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:18.960]  The problem is a lot of gun shops are doing this. And I don't know if you've seen the news where
[1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:23.840]  people that buy a bunch of ammo over 500 rounds, which isn't that much, get a police visit. Have
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:27.040]  you heard of knock and talk where they come to your door and just want to talk about your guns
[1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:32.880]  with you? No, no, not in the United States. Maybe when you get out to foreign countries like
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:37.280]  California and New York or something. No, sir. Knock and talk is going on everywhere.
[1:43:37.280 --> 1:43:44.800]  Foreign countries like California, I get the joke. It's not really a joke though. Now,
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:47.520]  knock and talk is going on in Dallas, going on in the wealthy areas.
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:54.320]  Hadn't heard that. Absolutely, sir. Well, God bless you. And we need to get the gun community.
[1:43:54.320 --> 1:43:58.480]  I mean, obviously you've probably seen record sales the last year because people are figuring
[1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:03.200]  out they're coming after our second amendment. Yeah, that's been about every gun shop I know
[1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:08.800]  of. Record sales. All right. Well, God bless you. They're not going to stop freedom. Thanks to
[1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:14.560]  people like you, sir. Take care. Thanks for letting me on. You bet. Thank you, Jim. Okay,
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:19.360]  now here is the ATF. This is from the stinkin federal government. This is from the whiskey
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:23.760]  regulators, the worst federal guns ever known. This is the worst federal agency, the first federal
[1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:29.920]  agency. They'd go out and take people out that own their own land that happened to have gold on
[1:44:29.920 --> 1:44:36.400]  it or water. I mean, the ATF are known as the regulators. You see a Clint Eastwood movie where
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:41.040]  the train pulls up and 20 guys get off in black suits and start killing people that there are
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:48.800]  literally thousands of famous cases of that into the 1930s. And the ATF is always the storm troopers
[1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:53.840]  that lead them. Now, here's from the storm troopers. ATF Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
[1:44:53.840 --> 1:44:59.040]  Farms and Explosives bring up unlicensed person questions to who may an unlicensed person transfer
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:06.800]  firearms under the GCA, the Gun Control Act. Now, let's turn to Q. There's Q on your screen.
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:13.280]  I think everybody ought to fax this to R. A. Saveda and K. I. Everybody else out there and show
[1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:18.320]  them the stinkin law. They are hoaxing everyone saying it's the law that you can't privately sell
[1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:25.280]  guns. A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of his state if he does not know or
[1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:31.920]  have reasonable cause to believe you don't have any responsibility. It's only if you know. Let me
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:36.080]  read the whole thing. To whom an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA? A person may
[1:45:36.080 --> 1:45:39.840]  sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of his state if he does not know or have reasonable
[1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:44.000]  cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under federal
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:49.280]  law. Any person may loan or rent a firearm to a resident of any state for temporary use for
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:53.840]  lawful sporting purposes. If he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is
[1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:58.000]  prohibited under receiving or possessing firearms. See, but they want to make it like England did
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:03.840]  30 years ago where you've got to register to get a gun. Then they just ban it. Now, that's the ATF,
[1:46:03.840 --> 1:46:11.680]  but K. I. and the Austin Police Department think you are so stupid. And CNN, I'm told,
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:14.560]  I haven't seen it yet, is now reported on this, but I'm told they reported the same thing.
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:19.840]  People are upset in Texas. You can't sell guns without a license or background check. What's
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:26.000]  the big deal? See, just like the carpet cleaner started calling the police on me because he
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:35.520]  saw a shotgun up on a gun rack 10 years ago. This is America. They think they're illegal.
[1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:40.320]  People drive by the Saxon gun and knife show. It got shut down. They would call 911. My God,
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:47.520]  there's a slave with a gun. The average person that's a feminine slave sees cops and SWAT teams
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:51.440]  in black masks, breaking women's legs and arms, put up the photo of the woman's leg broken peaceful
[1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:54.720]  protester we're getting her on. And they just go, Oh, I feel so safe when the government's
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:59.760]  breaking women's legs and tasering people have to death. God, I feel good. But then they see a
[1:46:59.760 --> 1:47:08.400]  citizen with a gun. They're like, Oh, please no, no. But they see citizens being brutalized and
[1:47:08.400 --> 1:47:12.720]  they go, Oh, that makes me feel safe. I love government. It didn't kill 200 million people
[1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:19.600]  in the 20th century. Government doesn't become corrupt. Oh, yes, it does. And I have this video
[1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:24.640]  out of Pittsburgh and this keeps happening where they shoot people a lot of the time off duty,
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:28.880]  not off duty, plain clothes, detectives jump out of cars. They stop. The guy had a bottle of
[1:47:28.880 --> 1:47:33.600]  mountain. They thought it was a weapon. He gets scared and it's on the video. They're not yelling
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:38.800]  police. So they're beating him. He tries to run. He trips and like wolves on a prey, they get him,
[1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:43.520]  beat him, tasering him in the head, rip his skin off. And then they charge him with assaulting them
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:50.080]  when it's on video. He didn't touch him. It's mental illness. They don't think of us as humans.
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:56.560]  It's psychopathic. They think of us as complete and total slaves. They think of us as it's not even
[1:47:56.560 --> 1:48:02.080]  being real. And if they break our leg or tasers or kill us or whatever, it's all right. Because,
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:05.440]  you know, they're doing a good job and some eggs are going to get broken. How they shoot your kid
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:09.200]  in the back because they're not trained. You know, they're hiring a bunch of cowardly weak people,
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:12.960]  too. If you notice a lot of the cops, they hire now. Cops have always had problems and had corruption.
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:17.120]  That's just the nature of it. But more and more, all over the country, they're like these little
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:23.840]  social workers and they just, they're just like the people we're about to play video of here in
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:36.400]  just a moment. Mark Dice goes out and he goes on the streets of San Diego and we talked to him
[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:40.080]  this morning. He's coming on later in the week and he said, no, this is in the order it happened.
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:44.960]  This is the people. He found two people that wouldn't sign a petition to ban free speech in
[1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:53.760]  America. Everybody else would. Everybody else would. And he did just a great job. Really impressive.
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:49:00.080]  What he's done. The full video is up on prisonplanet.com. If you want to go watch it. But we're going
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:03.840]  to play the video. I'm going to break it down in this segment and the next and Mike Adams
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:10.240]  on the flu hoax falling apart is coming up. I want to briefly again invite listeners to not
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:15.760]  procrastinate in the info war and realize that the enemy's propaganda has to be reapplied over and
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:20.480]  over again because they're lying or deceiving or twisting. But you show somebody how they've been
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:26.240]  lied to once or twice or three or four times. Most people will wake up and most people have
[1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:30.400]  already woken up that something's wrong. They just don't know the full import of what they're
[1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:35.920]  dealing with. And so what I want to encourage people to do is give people the films that have
[1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:40.480]  been the most successful at waking people up. Period. Loose change final cut available. Five

[1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:08.240]  are now storing non hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you
[1:51:08.240 --> 1:51:12.880]  know that in a real meltdown, non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:17.040]  It's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[1:51:17.040 --> 1:51:21.840]  that could even happen again. So our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect

[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:14.800]  Well, the flu hoax imploded in an even more spectacular way than I even thought it would.
[1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:20.160]  Great job everybody. Mike Adams coming up at the five after break when we start the second
[1:54:20.160 --> 1:54:25.680]  segment of the next hour. All right, but in this segment, the short next segment, I want to play
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:30.160]  Mark Dice. We're going to do cover this more on Thursday when he joins us live on the radio.
[1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:37.920]  He went out. This is the order he talked to people and only two people out of scores he talked to
[1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:46.400]  were against banning free speech in the Second Amendment. Now remember, more than half the public
[1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:51.680]  will ban your guns, will ban the Second Amendment. They are completely dumbed down. Look at these
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:57.120]  people in Southern California. These are not Americans. Look at how nasty they are. Look
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:03.200]  at how much they hate freedom. Let's go ahead and go to Mark Dice and the majority of the people
[1:55:03.200 --> 1:55:09.200]  they talked to said ban free speech when he even told them and bring in a new world order world
[1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:14.080]  government. That's what the petition said. They said, yes, we want it. Here we go. I'm Mark Dice and
[1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:21.360]  this is a petition to repeal the First Amendment to the Constitution. He made me say that nobody's
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:28.640]  going to sign this, but I would be willing to bet differently. Fish and please. What is it for?
[1:55:29.760 --> 1:55:36.880]  Just to repeal the First Amendment in the new world order. Stop hate speech. We want to really
[1:55:36.880 --> 1:55:44.480]  just kind of read. We'll kind of look at that issue again. People are disagreeing with the
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:57.840]  president. Stop that. Thanks. Hey, can you sign our petition quick to stop hate speech?
[1:55:57.840 --> 1:56:05.840]  Hate speech. Stop the hate speech. Get these people to stop saying the same things and disrespectful
[1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:16.800]  disrespectful things. Start with repealing the First Amendment and just kind of
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:23.440]  looking at that again. We really need that in the new world order in today's society.
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:30.640]  Can you just quick sign our petition? We're trying to repeal the First Amendment to the
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:38.960]  Constitution. It's part of the new world order. People are abusing things and saying really mean
[1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:45.440]  things about the president and his hate speech. So this will stop that.
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:51.760]  Actually, I feel very comfortable if I went on and researched it online a little bit more.
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:55.920]  Well, we're citizens against the First Amendment, catfa.org.
[1:56:57.040 --> 1:57:04.400]  I'm going to look on catfa.org. What would make you feel comfortable signing it?
[1:57:04.400 --> 1:57:07.520]  Just sitting down and looking at more information that's not online.
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:14.480]  Are you familiar with the evils of the First Amendment and how just horrible it is and how
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:20.320]  outdated such an idea is? I feel more comfortable just looking online and kind of researching it
[1:57:20.320 --> 1:57:27.120]  myself. We won't spam you or anything. Oh, I know. I know. But I like to make sure I know
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:32.480]  exactly what I'm signing. Just like, you know, just makes me feel comfortable knowing. Just to
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:37.440]  make sure. Just signing it and just signing it. I want to sign things that I believe in as well.
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:42.080]  So you'll know why we need to get rid of the First Amendment. Exactly. That's why I like it.
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:47.280]  Okay. All right. That makes sense. Thank you. Thanks. We just want to stop the hate speech.
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:52.880]  It was to be just a quick, quick thing to stop the hateful things. This guy's the worst.
[1:57:52.880 --> 1:57:55.920]  He loves it. He loves to legislate. He reads it line by line.
[1:57:55.920 --> 1:57:59.760]  The things that people say that they disagree with against the government
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:07.360]  and the Bilderberg group and just a signature on a birthday will be fine. No phone number.
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:17.600]  Sounds like a good thing. You know, I mean, in today's new world order, we don't need these idiots,
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:25.760]  you know, disagreeing with the president. Oh, we got to sign it too. I don't disagree.
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:30.240]  So you read this. You're okay with that? I'm okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Thanks. All right.
[1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:36.240]  Hit pause because he disagrees with people who don't like Obama. He wants to ban their free speech.
[1:58:36.240 --> 1:58:39.440]  Do you understand? They're coming for us.

[2:00:05.360 --> 2:00:12.720]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:12.720 --> 2:00:21.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:30.960]  Finishing up the Mark Dice video, the vast majority. He put the couple people in there who
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:44.000]  wouldn't sign the petition, but he had many, many more who were against the First Amendment
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:48.080]  that he didn't even have time to put in the YouTube video. It was going to only be 10 minutes long.
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:54.720]  So imagine we have people who want to repeal the Second Amendment, want to repeal the First
[2:00:54.720 --> 2:00:59.680]  Amendment. I guarantee you, dice could go out. I could go out and get not in Texas, but in
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:04.640]  California, the majority would say, yes, disarm me. I want to be a slave. But that last guy,
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:08.480]  he said, we want to ban people having free speech and criticizing Obama in any way.
[2:01:08.480 --> 2:01:13.920]  And he said, I agree with that. I agree, but we need to ban them. Signed. I mean, just I love
[2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:15.360]  tyranny. Let's go back to it.
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:22.160]  Repeal the First Amendment. Stop hate speech and negative, negative speech. Just a signature would
[2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:28.320]  be good. What is it for? What's hate speech? Well, it's hate speech. When you say hateful and mean
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:35.440]  things, we're CAFTA, CAFTA.org. It's just to support the, you know, the repeal of the First
[2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:48.400]  Amendment. Beautiful day. Hi. Signature. You know, I mean, in today's society, we don't need,
[2:01:48.400 --> 2:01:52.160]  I mean, who are the people to say that they don't agree with president anymore? You know,
[2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:59.840]  and he knows what's best. By the way, this video is not edited. They had a wireless mic. The
[2:01:59.840 --> 2:02:04.000]  camera is about 50 yards away. This is hidden video. So that's what you're hearing when a car
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  drives by or somebody walks by, you hear it cut out because they were right within the range
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:14.560]  of that wireless mic. We've got a bunch of them and they don't work over 50, 60 feet most of the
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:23.680]  time. So that's what's happening there. Continue. So we figured best thing, 200 year old legislation
[2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:31.360]  needs to be revised. You know, thanks. You know, in the new world order, we don't need that kind
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:37.760]  of stuff. Good pause again. I'm going to play more of this later, but notice those happy women with
[2:02:37.760 --> 2:02:41.600]  their kids enjoying the beautiful day that they think the world's a wonderland for them. The
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:46.080]  government loves them. The government's their big mommy, their big nanny, their big daddy.
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:51.760]  And he's like, we're going to take their speech away. They're being mean. And she says, I'm good
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:58.080]  when I want to sign. Let's take their speech away. That's America. We're going to all be friendly now
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:03.040]  and a female member of Congress. I have that video coming up later. She said, if we could just get
[2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:08.320]  all the men kicked out of Congress, we'd be able to pass this. See, we're going to have a big mommy
[2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:11.760]  stay. You're going to go to jail if you don't have the healthcare. And if we don't like how you're
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:15.760]  raising your kids, you yell at them, the state's going to take them. Doesn't matter if the state
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:21.520]  five times more likely to hurt kids than anybody. We don't need our day. So we don't need people
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:27.040]  selling guns privately in Austin. He says the feds say ban it. I'm going to ban it. I, you know,
[2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:32.320]  hey, you don't get a second amendment. You don't get a first amendment. I'm sorry. You're not going
[2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:37.760]  to be mean anymore. Our day. So Vita has created a new unit threatening to arrest people that
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:42.240]  criticize him on the internet. And he says, well, you know, if they do it with anonymity,
[2:03:42.240 --> 2:03:46.800]  we're going after you, you know, because that's freedom. You don't, you don't talk,
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:51.680]  and that's where he's from. California. Well, formerly Cuba. I mean, he says he doesn't like
[2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:56.320]  Fidel Castro. I think a little too much of that rubbed off on him as a kid growing up under Castro.
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:04:00.880]  I mean, seriously, why don't we have a police chief who's from Austin? And I want our day
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:05.040]  survey to come in here. Gloves are off in the interview. We'll see. He came in here and tried
[2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:09.840]  to co-opt us and glad hand us, but the blood without warrants and the, the gun grabbing,
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:14.320]  you know, our day, so Vita, give me a break. Of course, maybe, maybe Arnold sick as boys on.
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:18.080]  Maybe they can find something on me. Huh? That's what Fidel would do. Huh? Our day,
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:23.040]  so Vita. I'm Alex Jones. I'm not doing this on the internet with anonymity. I'm right here.
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:30.400]  I'm an American. You understand that? We welcome people from other countries if they come here
[2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:34.960]  and respect our nation, but we know they've imported millions of foreigners over 30 million
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:41.680]  illegals to slit this country's throat and we're done playing games. We're head up. We're not stopping.
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:51.520]  We're serious. We're focused. We're America. We're 1776. We are the patriots. We are the good guys.
[2:04:51.520 --> 2:05:03.760]  You are the bad guys. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:05:03.760 --> 2:05:08.720]  solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[2:05:08.720 --> 2:05:13.760]  electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[2:05:13.760 --> 2:05:18.640]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name
[2:05:18.640 --> 2:05:23.920]  of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[2:05:23.920 --> 2:05:29.200]  dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:05:29.200 --> 2:05:34.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:38.880]  lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[2:05:38.880 --> 2:05:42.960]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[2:05:42.960 --> 2:05:47.680]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information
[2:05:47.680 --> 2:05:54.560]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

[2:07:01.600 --> 2:07:05.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:07:05.600 --> 2:07:10.320]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:16.000]  we'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We have tremendous influence
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:21.760]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon
[2:07:21.760 --> 2:07:28.000]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:34.480]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[2:07:34.480 --> 2:07:39.360]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and
[2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:44.160]  the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right
[2:07:44.160 --> 2:07:51.120]  now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic
[2:07:51.120 --> 2:08:10.080]  on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:27.760]  Coming up in the fourth and final hour today, vital information on the government takeover
[2:08:27.760 --> 2:08:35.040]  of healthcare, sinking, vital information on the global warming fraud, a plan to found world
[2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:40.720]  government, stuff that dwarfs climate gate coming out every hour. I mean, total fraud,
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:45.600]  all the universities, the UN admitting it, they are just imploding and burning and exploding in
[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:53.120]  front of us if we force the issue and continue driving. Their flu hoax has imploded. The fact
[2:08:53.120 --> 2:08:59.120]  that the bank stole the trillions of dollars and didn't use it to help homeowners as they said
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:02.560]  and that they gave it to themselves and that they engineered the fraud as even in the clatching
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:09.200]  newspapers. This week, Treasury Secretary Geithner and Fed Chairman Bernanke are going to be
[2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:16.640]  grilled. There's discussion of criminal charges. Ladies and gentlemen, criminals always go too far
[2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:21.840]  and they may have half the population who wants to ban the First Amendment openly and ban the
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:28.480]  second. It doesn't matter. Even 99% say I'm a slave. I'm still free. I have a right to defend
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:33.120]  myself. Hitler may have said he was God in Germany. He could kill whoever he wanted. That was a
[2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:38.560]  fraud. He was a tyrant. Julius Caesar was a tyrant, but we don't have tyrant leaders today. They're
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:44.320]  just tyrant puppets. It's the global corporate crime syndicate coming in and taking over our society.
[2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:54.320]  Now, the flu hoax has imploded on paper in the courts, in the foreign news, but not a lot in our
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:10:01.520]  news. They're still running the ads to get your flu shot. Roughly 11% of people have died from this
[2:10:01.520 --> 2:10:06.080]  flu that regularly would die from the regular seasonal flu, and that's probably an inflated
[2:10:06.080 --> 2:10:11.200]  number. It's come out that most people they claim died, had heart failure, kidney problems, were
[2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:17.040]  already very sick, drug addicts, HIV, had compromised immune systems. It was a non-event,
[2:10:17.040 --> 2:10:22.400]  clearly an engineered virus. Top scientists are on record saying that. Big companies were caught
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:27.760]  with bird flu that was also killing around 30% of people that took it. That's London Telegraph.
[2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:33.040]  That's now in the European Union investigation. Looks like we're going to have members of that
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:40.560]  commission on this week. We're working on that right now, very, very close. You cannot overstate
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:46.320]  how big this is, and they're saying the vaccine's dangerous. The vaccine's bad. It didn't help
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:51.840]  people. It hurt people. It was a fraud. It's now coming out that of the U.S. advisors, just like
[2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:55.920]  Obama's advisors on government takeover of healthcare, turned out basically all of them
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:10:59.280]  are getting half a million, quarter million dollars from the White House covertly.
[2:10:59.280 --> 2:11:05.440]  It's coming out all these flu experts where had worked or were working or had stock or making money
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:10.720]  or were consultants, some cases making millions a year. These government officials that push the
[2:11:10.720 --> 2:11:17.360]  flu hype to get the hype really going in January of last year, three months before it even raised
[2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:22.480]  its ugly head. We had emergency managers on. We had internal documents from the Bureau of
[2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:27.680]  Cemetery's in New York where they were telling police, get ready for millions dead. They were
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:32.320]  telling doctors before it ever even showed up in Mexico. So they were pre hyping for total
[2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:37.760]  fear. So people will buy into it. The good news is they've never had a flu vaccine fail like this.
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:42.240]  The majority of people are not taking it. It's rotting on shelves. It's a huge controversy.
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:48.880]  So to walk through this is Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, really the leader
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:53.920]  in amazing research journalism. He was there day one exposing this with us.
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:12:01.040]  H1N1 swine flu hoax falls apart at the seams and he walks through it. So and the next time they
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:07.520]  try to push it to leave him be harder. Okay. So this is very exciting. I want to now go to Mike
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:13.200]  Adams. Mike, thank you for joining us today. Thank you Alex for inviting back. It's always an
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:17.840]  honor to talk to you and your listeners. Where do you want to begin? This is a huge topic.
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:23.760]  Tell folks where you're joining us from. Well, I'm in Ecuador. This is where I live permanently
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:28.720]  now. And if you hear construction sounds in the background, it's because I'm building a sustainable
[2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:34.960]  food forest here. You know, the food supply is a whole other topic. Maybe we could talk about
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:40.240]  someday, but the food supply of the world is not as safe as people have been told. And myself and
[2:12:40.240 --> 2:12:44.080]  many other people are here making sure that we can feed ourselves, our families and our neighbors
[2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:49.760]  when the time comes. Well, Monsanto, it's been in hundreds, literally hundreds, probably more
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:55.440]  studies. They've now in major effect guys print me that article about the liver failure again.
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:01.600]  It's confirmed in the most prestigious journals, massive liver and kidney failure and other
[2:13:01.600 --> 2:13:06.560]  organ failure of people that are eating different varieties will of the rats, but those are similar
[2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:12.800]  to humans of mammals that are eating their GMO corn. I mean, it's all coming out. But let's
[2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:19.360]  get into the flu hoax first because I don't think people realize just how devastating
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:22.480]  this is and the fact that they're now being criminally investigated.
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:29.840]  Yeah, it was a huge scam and they knew it from the beginning. And if you look at what they were
[2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:35.760]  trying to accomplish with this hoax, I think it was really two things, Alex. There are a couple
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:40.960]  of theories on this, but one, of course, was to transfer a tremendous amount of wealth,
[2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:47.040]  billions of dollars from the taxpayers and government into the pockets of the drug companies.
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:51.200]  And they did that very effectively by spreading fear, by spreading false information. I mean,
[2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:55.200]  they're still out there saying you should take your vaccine shot because there could be another
[2:13:55.200 --> 2:14:02.560]  wave coming. They just don't know when to quit. But the bigger agenda, I think, was to indoctrinate
[2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:10.080]  the American people into how they're supposed to behave when they're told to be afraid and how
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:14.800]  they're supposed to line up and get injected with whatever chemicals they're told are safe.
[2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:20.720]  Even though, Alex, you know this to be true, even though there has never been a single scientific
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:27.760]  clinical trial ever conducted on any of these swine flu vaccines that were approved by the FDA.
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:32.880]  So people were lining up to be injected with chemicals. They had no idea if they were safe,
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:37.760]  they were lied to, they were deceived, and they were indoctrinated. This is the way they want
[2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:44.640]  Americans to act from now on. And that's what the EU head of their health commission, he says,
[2:14:44.640 --> 2:14:48.240]  the bird flu vaccine killed a bunch of people. This flu vaccine is dangerous.
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:52.720]  The German government wouldn't even take this shot. People in government were paid off to push
[2:14:52.720 --> 2:14:58.720]  this, and they're having a huge investigation. I mean, it sounds like it's Mike Adams running
[2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:05.280]  that commission. Yeah, well, the truth eventually comes out on all these issues. I mean, they can't
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:11.600]  cover this up forever. If you look at who benefited from this scam, it's very obvious. For example,
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:20.240]  the former head of the CDC, Dr. Julie Gerberding, she, after being part of this scare story and
[2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:25.920]  part of pushing the vaccines, she was offered a position as president of the division of
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:31.200]  worldwide vaccines for the drug company, Merck. And she took that position and she obviously
[2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:37.120]  benefited in a huge way, a personal financial way from spreading this idea that everybody should
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:48.720]  take vaccines. Continue. Oh, okay. Well, the WHO, World Health Organization, in my opinion, conspired
[2:15:48.720 --> 2:15:55.680]  with the CDC, conspired with the drug companies to falsely elevate this pandemic to a so-called
[2:15:55.680 --> 2:16:01.280]  level six pandemic, even though it was always very mild. There was never any indication that
[2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:06.400]  it had a high fatality rate. In fact, as you mentioned in the introduction to this segment,
[2:16:06.400 --> 2:16:13.200]  it's the fatalities for this were far lower than seasonal flu. And another fact that they're not
[2:16:13.200 --> 2:16:22.320]  telling people is that of those who did die from H1N1 infections, many of those people were vaccinated
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:28.000]  with H1N1 vaccine. I mean, have you ever seen that in the press that some of the dead people
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:31.360]  were vaccinated and they died anyway? They don't tell you that, Alex.
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:38.480]  It's mind blowing. It's mind blowing to see this actually coming out in the open.
[2:16:39.840 --> 2:16:46.400]  Well, yeah, finally. It's finally starting to get out there. And we've done things like, for example,
[2:16:46.400 --> 2:16:54.480]  I put out a $10,000 award for anyone who could provide proof that the H1N1 vaccines
[2:16:54.480 --> 2:17:00.960]  had been proven safe and effective. And today, Alex, not one person has stepped forward
[2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:07.680]  to try to claim that $10,000. And yet, these vaccine pushers, they run around on the internet
[2:17:07.680 --> 2:17:12.240]  and all over the place in the media saying that their vaccines are scientific.
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:17.680]  You know, we're right and you're wrong. We have medical science and evidence on our side. Well,
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:20.720]  then why don't they claim the $10,000? Do they hate money?
[2:17:23.520 --> 2:17:28.560]  So I think, Alex, I think I'm going to announce on your show here that I'm going to double that
[2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:35.200]  award. I'm going to double it to $20,000. Let's see if anyone will step forward and claim $20,000
[2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:40.880]  to prove that those vaccines were ever scientifically proven to be safe and effective.
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:46.800]  Let's see if that works. Well, it could be $10 million. They can't do it because
[2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:52.640]  it's not been proven safe or effective. But the feds in the New York Times put out fact sheets,
[2:17:52.640 --> 2:18:00.080]  as you know, at schools, at vaccine centers, at medical facilities and government buildings,
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:06.880]  saying, oh, this dispels the myth, can't cause Guillain-Barre, can't cause autoimmune disorder,
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:12.080]  doesn't contain mercury. And I think it's the level of the hoax that blew up in their face.
[2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:16.480]  That's why they went too far because everybody just went and actually got the insert that actually
[2:18:16.480 --> 2:18:21.200]  came with the vaccine that said it could cause all of those problems that had mercury in it.
[2:18:21.200 --> 2:18:28.400]  I mean, it's the boldness of the lying. Yeah, absolutely. They don't know when to stop. And
[2:18:28.400 --> 2:18:34.320]  I remember journalists interviewing me, mainstream journalists, who would say things like, no, we've
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:39.920]  been assured by the drug companies that these vaccines have no chemical adjuvants, which are
[2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:46.720]  the inflammatory chemicals that multiply a small vaccine batch into a larger batch so they can
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:52.240]  inject. And we know mercury and aluminum are adjuvants. Oh, yeah, of course. You know,
[2:18:52.240 --> 2:18:57.440]  some of these vaccines have MSG-like chemicals in them. I mean, it's absolutely absurd,
[2:18:57.440 --> 2:19:03.280]  but it did blow up in their face because most people said, no, I'm not going to inject myself.
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:08.160]  I'm not going to subject my children to these poisons. And those people are doing just fine.
[2:19:08.160 --> 2:19:12.960]  Maybe they took some vitamin D. Maybe they ate some healthy foods. Maybe they got a little
[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:17.680]  sunshine or just took care of their immune system. They're alive and well and doing just great.
[2:19:17.680 --> 2:19:23.680]  They don't need a vaccine injection. Cass Sunstein says it should be an illegal conspiracy theory
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:29.600]  to say that sunshine is good for you. Did you see that? No, not the new one, but it doesn't surprise
[2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:35.440]  me. I'm not joking. I know that sounds crazy, folks, just like K.I. and Austin saying mercury's
[2:19:35.440 --> 2:19:40.640]  good for kids' brains. It's in his Chicago Law School report from a year and a half ago.
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:45.120]  He says, let me give you an example of a conspiracy theory that's outrageous and should be illegal.
[2:19:46.480 --> 2:19:51.840]  People saying that some sunlight is good for you. When it's every major medical outfit out there,
[2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:55.600]  all the major studies of how it stops you from getting many forms of cancer,
[2:19:55.600 --> 2:19:59.840]  we're supposed to get some sunlight. We'll be right back with Mike Adams, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:20:02.560 --> 2:20:08.400]  Our economy is in great distress. The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[2:20:08.400 --> 2:20:14.960]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does. You have auto and
[2:20:14.960 --> 2:20:22.400]  home insurance. Why wouldn't you have food insurance? Are you prepared to feed your family long term
[2:20:23.120 --> 2:20:29.680]  because it might take years to recover? As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family,
[2:20:29.680 --> 2:20:36.720]  especially during rough times. Survivalistseeds.com is offering a package that will give you a three

[2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:06.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:21:06.240 --> 2:21:10.960]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[2:21:11.760 --> 2:21:15.760]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous
[2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:22.000]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:27.920]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the
[2:21:27.920 --> 2:21:34.080]  enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[2:21:34.080 --> 2:21:38.960]  ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:43.600]  more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody
[2:21:43.600 --> 2:21:50.720]  does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet your copy of
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:57.840]  Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality

[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:13.440]  morning at 1099.50. A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for 1129.63, 564.83 for a half ounce or
[2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:22.480]  282.41 for the quarter ounce. That's 1129.63, 564.83 or 282.41. How is it that we the people grow
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:27.440]  the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from
[2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:32.160]  counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest,
[2:22:32.160 --> 2:22:37.120]  forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt. Is this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when
[2:22:37.120 --> 2:22:42.080]  he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[2:22:42.080 --> 2:22:46.560]  than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that

[2:24:07.040 --> 2:24:14.960]  GCN radio network. International hearings begin on falsified swine flu pandemic.
[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:24.480]  infowars.net. Steve Watson, we have the official 47 nation body health board. In order to promote
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:31.840]  their, this is from the head of the board, in order to promote their patented drugs and vaccines
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:37.200]  against flu, pharmaceutical companies, influence scientists and official agencies responsible
[2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:41.600]  for health standards to alarm governments worldwide and make them squander their tight
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:46.400]  health resources for inefficient vaccine strategy and needlessly expose millions of healthy people
[2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:52.480]  to the risk of an unknown amount of side effects of insufficiently tested vaccines. The bird flu
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:58.320]  campaign of 06 combined with the swine flu campaign seemed to have caused a great deal
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:03.120]  of damage not only to some vaccinated patients and to the public health budgets, but to the
[2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:09.120]  credibility and accountability of important international health agencies. And it continues
[2:25:09.120 --> 2:25:12.800]  and we've got one of the heads of the committee joining us Thursday or Friday. We're working
[2:25:12.800 --> 2:25:16.960]  on several of them right now, but Thursday and Friday. Going back to Mike Adams, Mike,
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:22.160]  we know that the federal government secretly went into health boards around the country,
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:26.480]  and this happened everywhere else in the world, a strategic operation, and told them in January
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:31.040]  and February, flu is coming. It's going to kill millions per state. That's what they told New
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:38.000]  York State, Indiana, Illinois. We knew it was really going to a level six in April,
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:43.200]  two months before it did, because of internal health board documents we got, state of Texas.
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:49.360]  I mean, this was a concerted hype. This was a concerted program to scare the hell out of everybody.
[2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:56.400]  Mike Adams. Absolutely. It was, Alex, and it worked like gangbusters for a very long time.
[2:25:56.400 --> 2:26:04.640]  And this is the way that they create demands for vaccines while also creating an engineered
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:12.000]  shortage of supply. And if you look at the work of covert persuasion and human psychology,
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:16.960]  and some of the research that has been conducted over the years, you know that the most effective
[2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:24.080]  way to motivate people to want something is to first make them afraid so that they have to
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:30.080]  have it and then tell them there isn't enough to go around. They use this in order to get people
[2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:35.280]  lining up for persuasion vaccine. And it worked extremely well. And then, of course,
[2:26:35.280 --> 2:26:40.240]  when the whole thing, when the hoax broke and they had plenty of supply of vaccines,
[2:26:41.040 --> 2:26:45.920]  the whole thing reversed on them. And people realized, well, gee, there's plenty of supply now,
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:53.040]  and the pandemic isn't really a pandemic. And we even have the CFR recorded where they talk
[2:26:53.040 --> 2:26:57.120]  about, we'll say there's not enough vaccine to make everybody run out and want to get it.
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:04.320]  Yeah, the tactics here have been really remarkable. But the most interesting part
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:12.480]  about this, Alex, has been the the convictiousness of the vaccine pushers. And you got to realize
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:17.600]  when you're dealing with vaccine pushers, these are people who, in my opinion, because they've
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:22.800]  taken so many vaccines in the past, and the brains have been bathed in these chemical
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:29.120]  adjuvants, these people are literally, and this is not an insult of a term. This is a scientific
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:35.520]  description. They are brain damaged. They lack cognitive function to think for themselves.
[2:27:36.240 --> 2:27:42.240]  This is part of the agenda, I believe, Alex, that the vaccines are designed to create a nation of
[2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:47.200]  people who cannot think for themselves. It's kind of like before. I mean, they're on the news
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:51.600]  saying, Mercury's good for your children now, treating us like we're totally brain damaged.
[2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:56.720]  And now that you ends having to lower the average IQ, and pretty soon you'll be a genius if you're
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:03.440]  able to say your ABCs are tire shear laces. Well, there's a movie, Idiocracy, by I think
[2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:08.240]  starring Luke Wilson. It was a wonderful movie. Mike Judge. Yeah, Mike Judge. Yeah, Mike Judge
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:12.640]  created the movie. Right. And in the previous segment, you were talking about Mark Dice going
[2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:17.280]  out and having people sign the petition to repeal a First Amendment, and they were signing it.
[2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:22.880]  You know, people have forgotten how to think, or they are seriously so brain damaged that they
[2:28:22.880 --> 2:28:28.160]  cannot assess... Well, by the way, Mike, that's not your opinion. I mean, we have the sodium
[2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:31.440]  fluoride and other chemicals put in the water. They know brain damages. We have government
[2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:34.960]  documents where they said they would do it to control people. We know Mercury's the most deadly
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:39.440]  heavy metal for brain damage. We know that they want to drug the population. We have the new
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:44.080]  Freedom Initiative documents. This is in all the U.N. documents, how they were going to drug the
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:49.120]  population. It's the brave new world. Yeah, that's right. And don't forget the Mothers Act and the
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:55.040]  Mental Health Initiative for Expectant Mothers. They want to drug the babies before they're
[2:28:55.040 --> 2:28:59.280]  even born. And now they're saying they want to put lithium in the water supply. Have you seen
[2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:05.280]  that newscast? Oh, you know what? I can't keep track of all the poison agendas. There's just too
[2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:10.640]  much... By the way, I'm not joking about the CFR audio blog. They put it out where they talked about
[2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:18.080]  how they were hoaxing people by saying there wasn't enough vaccine. Again, nothing surprises me at
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:22.080]  this point. If there's anything that we learned from this pandemic and the way people have acted,
[2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:29.200]  it's that they would do anything. The vaccine pushing jackals, I call them sometimes. They
[2:29:29.200 --> 2:29:35.600]  would do anything to get more vaccines injected into more babies, more men and women, more senior
[2:29:35.600 --> 2:29:40.800]  citizens. They'll do anything. They'll lie. They'll deceive. They'll distort. They'll commit fraud.
[2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:47.920]  And this is just normal everyday business for them. Just like the local Austin News saying it's
[2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:54.400]  illegal for private people to sell guns when it's not. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.280 --> 2:30:03.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. One major world crisis away from having
[2:30:03.760 --> 2:30:08.960]  a totalitarian type of system. The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world. The

[2:31:24.960 --> 2:31:29.840]  food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you

[2:33:22.160 --> 2:33:33.360]  him right now. 1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231. We're going back to him in just a moment.
[2:33:33.360 --> 2:33:40.160]  Don't forget there is a protest against the racketeering harassment shutdown of the oldest
[2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:46.960]  gun show in central Texas today, 5 to 7 p.m. Be there early, folks. I'm going to be there right
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:54.000]  before 5. It's 7th and 8th Street on the west side of I-35, the Austin Police Station. West
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:59.600]  side of I-35, you cannot miss it. They've got giant big brother banners hanging up,
[2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:04.080]  worshiping checkpoints. Last time I drove by, they always change them out. I'm not sure what's
[2:34:04.080 --> 2:34:08.480]  up there now. The point is, it's a big brick building, one of scores of facilities they have,
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:14.160]  and you can go and let them know you don't appreciate what they've done. The media will
[2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:17.440]  be there, be able to talk to the media. I know the media has been alerted, but everybody else
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:23.920]  should contact the media and tell them to be there. All the radio, TV stations, you name it,
[2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:28.800]  they need to be there. We're going back to Mike Adams here in just a moment, the Health Ranger,
[2:34:29.680 --> 2:34:34.240]  about this big victory we've had, because this is record amounts of people didn't take this shot.
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:37.920]  It's a big controversy in England and Europe and the U.S. that there's so much of this vaccine
[2:34:37.920 --> 2:34:42.320]  that was bought rotting that no one wants. That is coming up. I'm also going to get into all the
[2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:47.600]  other info on GMO food. For those of you that aren't aware of what's happening to you, but before
[2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:51.840]  we do that, I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[2:34:52.720 --> 2:34:58.320]  Tap water in most cities is a toxic brew. When they say fluoride near water, that's over 150
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:04.560]  on average, sometimes over 300 chemicals. They added the water, the chlorine, the dead bacteria.
[2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:09.040]  It just tastes like crud, and a lot of filtered water is in high quality. A lot of bottled water
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:13.840]  has problems, but people still drink it because it tastes better. The Acola Blue is the best water
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:18.480]  you can get. Period. AcolaBlue.com, it grabs the water right out of the atmosphere, sends it through
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:25.760]  seven filters with their Acola Blue 28. They have their Acola Blue 30, puts it through 12 stage,
[2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:33.360]  including reverse osmosis, carbon, UV light. AcolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, or 800-69-1,
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:42.400]  60-43, 800-69-1, 60-43. Another great sponsor, Front Sight Firearms Training, FrontSight.com.
[2:35:43.760 --> 2:35:47.520]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at the Front Sights Firearms Training
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:52.480]  Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar, plus if
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:57.120]  you act fast, the millionaire patriot who owns it will give you a free Springfield Armory XD
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:00.640]  pistol in the caliber of your choice. I believe now is the time for you and your family to be
[2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:05.040]  armed and trained, to level, to exceed law enforcement military standards. Front Sight provides
[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:09.760]  such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes and the millionaire
[2:36:09.760 --> 2:36:14.320]  patriot is paying his own money to help you get this. This is real, this is awesome, this is the
[2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:18.800]  biggest private firearms training facility in the country, shotguns, handguns, rifles. Front Sight,
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:22.400]  one word, like the front of your rifle. FrontSight.com, plus it's a great website,
[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:28.160]  a lot of resources for gun owners and defenders of liberty, free email alert system and newsletter,
[2:36:28.160 --> 2:36:34.480]  frontsite.com. Okay, going back to Mike Adams. Mike, there's so much to cover here dealing with the
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:40.720]  flu. I mean, a lot of people did get stampeded to take it, but a lot of people, I mean, they're
[2:36:40.720 --> 2:36:45.440]  reporting record numbers didn't, so there's just millions and millions and millions and millions.
[2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:51.520]  What is it? 50-something million in the U.S., tens of millions in England of these dosages,
[2:36:51.520 --> 2:36:57.200]  just sitting there, these vials of this monkey pus that they wanted to inject into people.
[2:36:57.200 --> 2:37:01.920]  And the whole history of what vaccines have done. I mean, do you see this as I do as a
[2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:07.520]  devastating defeat for these people? Well, sure it is. Of course, they're going to try to spin it
[2:37:07.520 --> 2:37:13.280]  as a success because several million people did decide to get vaccinated because they fell for
[2:37:13.280 --> 2:37:19.120]  all the propaganda, but even in America, four out of five people refused to be vaccinated or just
[2:37:19.120 --> 2:37:25.120]  avoided being vaccinated. So what they're going to try to do now is donate these vaccines to
[2:37:25.120 --> 2:37:29.840]  third world countries so they can look like they have some human compassion. Truth is,
[2:37:29.840 --> 2:37:33.840]  they're only donating them because they can't sell them to anybody. Nobody wants them anymore,
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:39.040]  and they're too toxic to dump into landfill. That would be an EPA violation. Remember that,
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:43.680]  if you ever think about injecting this stuff into your own body. So they're going to dump them off
[2:37:43.680 --> 2:37:47.280]  to third world countries. Maybe they'll get Bill Gates to come in and sponsor some of that, too,
[2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:51.600]  because he's all about vaccines in third world countries. They're going to try to claim a victory,
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:56.000]  no matter what, even though they have failed miserably. Now you've got to brain damage the
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:01.760]  third world. His good daddy, former head of the Planned Parenthood, knows that well. And again,
[2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:07.680]  this is part of this larger agenda. But you talk about the deaths. We know the bird flu vaccine
[2:38:07.680 --> 2:38:12.800]  killed a bunch of people. That's mainstream news. In fact, put London Telegraph up, death of homeless,
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:16.880]  bird flu vaccine. They told him it was a regular flu shot. Then you talk about how they're dumping
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:20.880]  them on the third world. They have announced they're doing that. That'll be by next year or
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:26.000]  later when this has already run its course and it'll have no effect. And they admit even the
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:30.640]  H1N1 is already mutated onto something else. Just totally worthless, but they'll just line people
[2:38:30.640 --> 2:38:36.960]  up and give them the mercury filled injection. Well, yeah, sure. There's a bigger agenda here
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:41.600]  that I'll mention here in a second. But first on the actual number of people who were killed,
[2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:45.440]  we know that people had been paralyzed. They suffered neurological damage from the vaccines
[2:38:45.440 --> 2:38:50.720]  themselves. But that's just short term, immediate term effects. What people don't know is what will
[2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:55.920]  be the long term effects of taking these vaccines. What happens two years down the road or five years
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:39:01.280]  down the road? Do you get Alzheimer's 10 years sooner than you might have? Well, the studies show
[2:39:01.280 --> 2:39:07.600]  that if you take three flu shots, you get double the chances of Alzheimer's.
[2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:13.200]  Absolutely. And it makes perfect sense. Why? Because the stuff attacks the nervous system.
[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:18.160]  It causes inflammatory nervous system damage in many people who take them. But the bigger
[2:39:18.160 --> 2:39:23.600]  agenda here, Alex, isn't really about swine flu or any flu. The bigger agenda is about
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:29.680]  vaccines. And the drug companies, they stumbled onto a really clever scam here where they can
[2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:34.560]  now sell vaccines to people who aren't sick. Because you know, drugs are sort of limited
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:40.160]  to people who are sick, people who have an illness, right? But vaccines, you can push them on
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:44.480]  everybody. You don't need to be sick. You don't need to have any symptoms. You don't need to have
[2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:50.240]  any medical justification whatsoever. You can push vaccines on the people just out of fear alone.
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:56.480]  So they're working on vaccines now for all kinds of crazy cigarettes alcohol for sadness, for
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:02.640]  example. And they're going to push these on all of us. Unlimited vaccines from the time you're
[2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:07.520]  born, even before you're born to the time that you die. You are nothing but a vessel to accept
[2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:12.560]  more chemical vaccine injections while you make the drug companies rich. And that's the big issue
[2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:17.200]  that we haven't really gotten into. They tried to make this mandatory in Massachusetts and New
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:23.920]  York and California lawsuits got filed by valiant people. It got stopped. But they certainly are
[2:40:23.920 --> 2:40:28.400]  using this as a form of medical tyranny, as Ron Paul has said, to set the precedent to put in
[2:40:28.400 --> 2:40:34.240]  our bodies, what they want, when they want. Well, absolutely. There have been efforts all
[2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:40.560]  across the country. There was even a risk of it happening in Texas where the the Gardasil
[2:40:40.560 --> 2:40:48.720]  vaccine for HPV was about to be mandated for teenage girls. And lastly, Rick Perry ran the
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:54.080]  hoax. Rick Perry ran the hoax and said it was the law. When it wasn't, he made it a recommended
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:41:00.640]  shot to the state health department. Right, right. And you know, I agree with Rick Perry on
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:05.840]  on many other issues, but on vaccines, I think he got a little hoodwinked by the drug companies.
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:11.600]  And hopefully he'll come around and realize that vaccines should never be forced on to anyone. It
[2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:16.800]  should always be the free choice of the parents, not the state, and certainly not the federal
[2:41:16.800 --> 2:41:25.600]  government. Well said. Shifting gears, Monsanto GMO corn link to organ failure study reveals.
[2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:29.680]  I mean, we've known this forever in a study released by the International Journal of
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:32.960]  Biological Sciences that he doesn't get any more prestigious for those that don't know.
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:38.960]  So analyzing the effects of genetically modified foods on mammalian, that's mammals,
[2:41:38.960 --> 2:41:43.920]  that's us, researchers found that agricultural giant Monsanto GM corn is linked to organ
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:47.520]  damage and rats. And they study rats because they're very similar to us in their metabolic
[2:41:47.520 --> 2:41:52.640]  system for those that don't know. According to the study, which was summarized by, and it goes on,
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:42:01.040]  three varieties of Monsanto GM corn, MON 863 insecticide producing MON 810 and round up herbicide
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:07.600]  absorbing NK603 were approved for consumption by the US European and several other national food
[2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:13.040]  safety authorities. And it goes on to talk about the effects from the journal were mostly concentrated
[2:42:13.040 --> 2:42:19.280]  in the kidney and liver function, the two major diet detoxification organs, but in detail different
[2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:25.600]  from each GM type. In addition, some effects on the heart, adrenal, spleen, blood cells were also
[2:42:25.600 --> 2:42:32.000]  frequently noted. There were, as there normally exists, sex differences in the liver and kidney
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:35.920]  metabolic system, the highly statistical significant disturbances in the function of
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:41.760]  these organs seen between male and female rats cannot be dismissed as biologically insufficient,
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:47.680]  as has been proposed by others. Therefore, we conclude that our data strongly suggests that
[2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:56.720]  these GM maize varieties, those are the ones killing the bees, induce a state of, and it says, heptarelia
[2:42:56.720 --> 2:43:02.800]  toxicity. I'm sure I'm mispronouncing that these substances have never before been an integral
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:06.640]  part of human and animal diet and therefore health consequences for those who consume them,
[2:43:06.640 --> 2:43:15.280]  especially over long periods. Now, this is very simple. If you produce a pharmacological variety
[2:43:15.280 --> 2:43:22.880]  of corn that produces a pesticide within it, or if you produce corn that will live when everything
[2:43:22.880 --> 2:43:28.560]  else dies when you spray herbicide on it and it absorbs it, obviously it's going to attack the
[2:43:28.560 --> 2:43:34.000]  liver and kidneys and the blood. I mean, this is a two-year-old can figure this out. Other bugs,
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:39.040]  and I've again interviewed top German scientists who first exposed this five years ago, other bugs
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:45.520]  will not eat this corn or, and they won't go to the corn pollinization process. Bees will,
[2:43:46.080 --> 2:43:50.800]  and the poor little guys are dying and they've done maps of the areas where these corn are grown.
[2:43:50.800 --> 2:43:55.840]  I mean, you know, Monsanto knows what it's doing. It's like Satan runs it. We know Rumsfeld
[2:43:55.840 --> 2:44:01.040]  previously did. I mean, literally, is Satan in a red pajamas at the boardroom with his feet up?
[2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:05.200]  This is the corn that's in most our food. They know what they're doing. They don't care. I mean,
[2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:12.000]  Mike Adams, I had a magazine reporter interviewing me last night and I kept saying, he said, you
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:16.880]  know, you can't just say Monsanto's doing this and knows what they're doing. You can't, that's
[2:44:16.880 --> 2:44:22.160]  irresponsible. And I said, sir, it's mainstream news. And he just looked at me like I was crazy,
[2:44:22.160 --> 2:44:27.680]  because he can't believe, because he's a nice person, that this is really going on. I mean,
[2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:36.000]  folks, it's going on. Okay, Mike Adams. Well, people need to understand that human nature can
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:42.560]  be far darker than you've been led to believe. If you live in a civilized society, you don't see
[2:44:42.560 --> 2:44:49.280]  what goes on behind the closed doors of corporate boardrooms, where the real selfishness and the
[2:44:49.280 --> 2:44:54.240]  evil and the destructiveness of some of these individuals is unleashed through their corporate
[2:44:54.240 --> 2:45:00.320]  agenda. And I agree with you that Monsanto, in my opinion, is one of the most dangerous corporations
[2:45:00.320 --> 2:45:07.120]  on our planet. And they are, in my view, poisoning the food supply. I hope, I don't know if you've
[2:45:07.120 --> 2:45:11.760]  had Jeffery Smith on your show from the episode of deception.com, right? We sell it. We sell those
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:18.720]  books and videos. Everyone needs to read his material and watch his documentaries. He presents
[2:45:18.720 --> 2:45:23.360]  information that will blow your mind. And it's so shocking that the mainstream journalists
[2:45:23.360 --> 2:45:29.440]  just can't accept it. And it gets back to this question of what is wrong with people's thinking
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:34.880]  skills these days. How come they can't question things like... Close to 90% of people in San
[2:45:34.880 --> 2:45:40.880]  Diego that were interviewed said ban free speech. Jeff, I remember Dice was out there
[2:45:40.880 --> 2:45:47.280]  trying to sell an ounce of gold, a gold coin for what, 50 bucks or 20 bucks? It was an ounce of
[2:45:47.280 --> 2:45:54.240]  gold at worth, you know, 1,100 or more. No one would buy it. What's wrong with people these
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:59.440]  days? I don't have the answer to that, Alex. The average adult watches two and a half hours.
[2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:05.200]  This is the latest number from 2009 from Nielsen. Two and a half hours of internet TV a week,
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:10.560]  four and a half of television. They're mesmerized. They're not awake. People are zombies.
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:16.480]  Yeah, they really are. And I think if you remember the old zombie movies and the zombies
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:22.000]  attack and you would have fields of mindless people wandering around society, attacking each
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:30.240]  other, that really isn't too far off from what may be coming at some point here in the real world.
[2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:35.440]  Would just people not having the ability to think for themselves, to question the information they're
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:41.280]  given, to even take care of their own bodies or immune systems or to defend themselves against
[2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:47.440]  bad information that's coming their way. I've seen America. I've seen America. Many Americans
[2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:53.840]  have fallen asleep. They've forgotten what America stands for, which is rugged individualism,
[2:46:53.840 --> 2:47:00.640]  liberty, freedom, thinking for yourself and standing up against tyranny rather than conspiring with it.
[2:47:00.640 --> 2:47:04.800]  And I just hope that in our lifetimes, Alex, hopefully in the next few years,
[2:47:04.800 --> 2:47:10.400]  we can see Americans take back America, take back what it stands for, what it was founded on,
[2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:16.160]  and what we all are owed, our God given rights to liberty, to health, to access the information.
[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:19.360]  This is what we all deserve and we must take it back, Alex.
[2:47:20.080 --> 2:47:22.720]  Well, I want to say this to the police and military listening
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:28.320]  who are going to be the enforcers of this system. You are drinking poison water. You are eating
[2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:36.320]  poison food. I know it's hard to believe. Please read the thousands of studies on GMO. I mean,
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:41.680]  I've interviewed former head scientist who would say it's killing half the rats. You can't approve
[2:47:41.680 --> 2:47:48.240]  this potato in the 1990s and it's approved. You can't feed them this corn. It's killing the rats
[2:47:48.800 --> 2:47:54.240]  and they do it. Part of it might be that they want to kill the rats, but we are the rats.
[2:47:55.120 --> 2:47:59.440]  We're the rats and then want to kill us. No, no, I know exactly. That's the end game. That,
[2:47:59.440 --> 2:48:03.520]  Mike, I know it's the end game, but I'm saying the average cop driving along right now,
[2:48:03.520 --> 2:48:10.000]  he's like, hey, Mike, my corn taco, you know, when he pulls into a Mexican food drive-through
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:15.920]  window, you know, it's fine, but no, it's turned out they sell this corn at below regular prices
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:20.800]  to all the major chains. This is what you're getting is food filler and cereals and in everything.
[2:48:20.800 --> 2:48:26.960]  I mean, we're, and they're GMOing the, the, all the other major grains and the, and the soybean and
[2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:31.520]  they're now moving into hundreds of other things and they're shutting the farms down.
[2:48:31.520 --> 2:48:37.600]  I mean, folks, you are being killed. I mean, sugar beets now genetically modified sugar
[2:48:37.600 --> 2:48:43.920]  beets are now approved and being used to produce processed sugar. So, you know, now you have,
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:48.800]  you have what high fructose corn syrup, which is called liquid satin by some people because it's
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:53.520]  so bad for your health. And now you have genetically modified sugar as the mainstream
[2:48:53.520 --> 2:48:57.840]  sugar source and the food supply. And then the Washington Post, I'm sorry to interrupt,
[2:48:57.840 --> 2:49:03.920]  in the Washington Post reported last year, 50% of the corn syrup has high levels of mercury,
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:07.280]  and they don't know why it's not even involved in the process. I mean, folks,
[2:49:07.280 --> 2:49:10.320]  they're hitting you and hitting you hard and now we're exposing them. So they say,
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:14.160]  you know what, mercury's good. If that guys pull up 50% of corn syrup has mercury,
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:19.760]  Washington Post for folks, I'm sorry, go ahead, Mike. Well, the problem here is, and I understand
[2:49:19.760 --> 2:49:23.680]  this, but even people listening to this may be thinking themselves, well, what am I supposed to
[2:49:23.680 --> 2:49:30.160]  do? It's so overwhelming. How do we decide what to trust, what to not trust? How do we feed our
[2:49:30.160 --> 2:49:36.000]  kids something that won't poison them? It's just so overwhelming. And there's too much conflicting
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  information out there, but that's part of the game. The PR jackals for these processed food
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:46.160]  companies and chemical companies and drug companies, they want you to be confused because
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:51.360]  in your confusion, you would default to whatever you've been shown on television.
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:56.560]  And Mike, you've been told by authorities. And Mike, it's just like poisoning animals that
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:01.360]  they want to get rid of. They'll poison their water supply with a slow acting poison. And so
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:06.080]  the animals don't drop dead right on the spot. So the wild dogs or whatever they're poisoning,
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:10.960]  drink it and a month later die. And that's what the UN said they would do. I have all these
[2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:15.040]  government documents where they said we will introduce it into the food, into the water,
[2:50:15.040 --> 2:50:20.000]  and we will brain damage people and then kill them and they're doing it. And the public can't
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:27.600]  even get angry right now because they're on a toxic sedative fluoride. That's exactly it.
[2:50:27.600 --> 2:50:34.080]  You nailed it. I mean, it's kind of a brilliant, evil genius conspiracy to first numb the population
[2:50:34.080 --> 2:50:38.640]  and then just sort of kill them off slowly through the food supply. Well, they've already
[2:50:38.640 --> 2:50:44.000]  accomplished most of that goal and the rest is coming. There's a Batman episode, one of the
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:49.360]  Batman movies, where the bad guy says, yeah, we staged the Gulf of Tonkin. We staged terror attacks.
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:53.680]  This is from the early 90s. And then he says, and we're going to put different poisons and
[2:50:53.680 --> 2:50:58.560]  different cosmetics and they'll never know, then we'll sell them the cure. They're just throwing
[2:50:58.560 --> 2:51:03.520]  it in our face what they're doing. Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on
[2:51:03.520 --> 2:51:08.480]  earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil
[2:51:08.480 --> 2:51:13.840]  of the hemp plant. At hempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free
[2:51:13.840 --> 2:51:18.880]  shipping to the US and Canada. At hempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible

[2:52:01.680 --> 2:52:07.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance
[2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:12.880]  to not relive history. Is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[2:52:12.880 --> 2:52:18.400]  Americans at home? It has turned a tremendous influence on our president and Congress and
[2:52:18.400 --> 2:52:24.400]  they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens
[2:52:24.400 --> 2:52:29.920]  to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore
[2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:35.440]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:52:35.440 --> 2:52:40.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[2:52:40.560 --> 2:52:45.280]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[2:52:45.280 --> 2:52:52.240]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[2:53:01.120 --> 2:53:06.640]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy
[2:53:06.640 --> 2:53:12.320]  and vibrant health? Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases
[2:53:12.320 --> 2:53:18.240]  the oxygen content of your body. Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive
[2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:24.320]  in an alkaline high pH environment. Alchivision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the
[2:53:24.320 --> 2:53:30.400]  most alkaline minerals. Using alchivision pH drops is the best way to make your water alkaline
[2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:35.920]  to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy. Simply put 10 drops in the water you
[2:53:35.920 --> 2:53:40.800]  drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level. Most experts agree that the water you drink
[2:53:40.800 --> 2:53:46.480]  should be at a pH level of 8 or higher. Order your bottle of alchivision plasma pH drops now
[2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:56.080]  by going directly to alchivision.com. That's A-L-K-A-Vision.com or by calling 269-409-1776.
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:54:10.000]  Mike Adams will be with us until we go to break in the next segment, next hour. Then we're gonna get
[2:54:12.800 --> 2:54:17.840]  the proprietor of the former Austin Gun Show lawn briefly to talk about the protests coming up
[2:54:17.840 --> 2:54:24.720]  tonight that I'm news blitzing for the rest of the show. NaturalNews.com is the powerful website
[2:54:24.720 --> 2:54:30.160]  of our guest, the health ranger, Mike Adams. Mike, let's go to phone calls. Let's go ahead.
[2:54:30.160 --> 2:54:33.600]  And by the way, I have a Wall Street Journal article here about poison and progress,
[2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:38.640]  about secret poisoning of the food supply, but they say Alcada will do it and that they'll do
[2:54:38.640 --> 2:54:43.280]  it with slow kill weapons. Jaren just printed this off for me. The government are the terrorists,
[2:54:43.280 --> 2:54:48.240]  folks. They're the ones poisoning you. Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Daryl in Texas. Daryl,
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:55.280]  you're on the air. Hello, appreciate y'all. I have a question about nutrition. I have so
[2:54:55.280 --> 2:54:59.920]  many questions to ask, but I think the one that I want to ask most is about nutrition, and that is,
[2:54:59.920 --> 2:55:06.720]  there are many superfoods, multivitamins, smoothies, and that sort of thing that are on the market.
[2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:14.400]  What is your advice for someone who is, as a pharmacist, semi-educated about the body and
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:21.040]  that sort of thing, but if I'm going to set out to find the best way to, like, a reference or
[2:55:21.040 --> 2:55:26.720]  something that I can go to, should someone be doing more, like, if you're taking a multivitamin
[2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:31.920]  and you're incorporating vegetables in every meal, how much more do you need? Do you need
[2:55:31.920 --> 2:55:36.560]  the superfoods? Mike's going to tell you, eat raw foods, but Mike, tell him.
[2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:44.320]  Well, no, I'm not a total raw foodist myself, but I do eat some portion raw at every meal,
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:48.480]  for a number of reasons, but, you know, you get to realize that number one,
[2:55:48.480 --> 2:55:53.920]  our food supply is depleted of nutrients. Even if it's fresh produce right out of the garden,
[2:55:53.920 --> 2:55:57.200]  most of the soils are depleted, so we're not getting the minerals that we get,
[2:55:57.200 --> 2:56:01.520]  and the processed food, of course, is, you know, complete garbage. Minerals are key, aren't they?
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:07.040]  Well, absolutely, and trace minerals like selenium are very important for things
[2:56:07.040 --> 2:56:13.120]  like cancer prevention, but in terms of going, how do you decide that you have a quality source?
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:17.200]  Well, you've got to do your research, because even though I'm as much an advocate of
[2:56:17.200 --> 2:56:21.680]  vitamins and nutritional supplements, there are bad vitamins, and there are good vitamins,
[2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:25.600]  because some of the vitamins are made by the drug companies, and they're just full of chemicals,
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:29.840]  and you've got to know the difference. Yeah, they make synthetic chemical copies from the
[2:56:29.840 --> 2:56:36.480]  extra petrochemical fluvium they have, and it's incredibly toxic.
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:40.960]  Yeah, you wouldn't believe where some of this stuff comes from, like petrochemical byproducts.
[2:56:40.960 --> 2:56:43.920]  Well, here's a quick example. Here's a quick example for people that don't believe me.
[2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:49.120]  Every time I see somebody drinking a Diet Coke, I say, you know, that's genetically engineered
[2:56:49.120 --> 2:56:55.440]  E. coli feces. I mean, that's what aspartame is, is bacteria feces, and people just can't believe
[2:56:55.440 --> 2:57:01.280]  that. Go ahead, Mike. No, well, you're right. It's a good, different point of view on where
[2:57:01.280 --> 2:57:06.720]  that stuff really comes from. But yeah, there are good quality supplements out there, bad quality.
[2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:10.000]  For example, if you're trying to look at a vitamin, and you want to know if it's good quality, if
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:15.840]  it's a multi, look at the form of a vitamin B12 that's in the bottle. If it's cyanocobalamine,
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:22.240]  that's like a cyanide molecule, a cyanone is the prefix, then it's the cheap, and in my opinion,
[2:57:22.240 --> 2:57:27.040]  the unhealthy version of vitamin B12, and that's what you find in most supplements. The healthy
[2:57:27.040 --> 2:57:33.600]  version is typically called methylcobalamine, M-E-T-H-Y-L, and that is a methylated version
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:38.960]  of that molecule that's more absorbable by your body. It's just one small example, but there
[2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:43.600]  are many others that you can learn by doing some research. I hope that answers your question.
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:51.760]  Andrew and Mayn, you're on the air with Mike Adams. Hello? Yes. Hello. It's a great show, Alex.
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:58.960]  Thank you. And Mike's articles are really great. I really feel vindicated hearing
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:06.400]  how he has exposed the flu scam. It's very surprising how it fell apart. The people here
[2:58:07.360 --> 2:58:13.120]  lined up from the propaganda, and the children didn't want it, but the parents
[2:58:13.120 --> 2:58:17.200]  knew in their heart they didn't want it, but they did it anyway. But my question is
[2:58:17.200 --> 2:58:27.520]  whether or not they will still try to have an engineered flu, and that was one of the concerns
[2:58:28.640 --> 2:58:31.680]  that we had along the way. It was really surprising the way it fell apart.
[2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:39.840]  Andrew and Mayn, any other questions? We'll answer your question. We'll answer your question when
[2:58:39.840 --> 2:58:48.880]  we come back. Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.

[3:00:12.480 --> 3:00:22.880]  I'm going to get to that question earlier. Obama last year signed an executive order
[3:00:22.880 --> 3:00:27.760]  preparing for basically martial law under biological attack, ties into the John Warner
[3:00:27.760 --> 3:00:35.200]  Defense Authorization Act, PDD 51, and others. Clearly, they're eyeing that as a possible
[3:00:35.200 --> 3:00:42.720]  next false flag, and the bigger flu scare was just a drill. Mike Adams, they clearly are
[3:00:42.720 --> 3:00:47.840]  trying to set the precedent to forcibly inoculate us. Your comments on a stage-release flu.
[3:00:48.400 --> 3:00:51.600]  This one, we have government documents where they admitted they were going to release a flu
[3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:57.440]  simulant of H1N1 a year before they did it. So it looks like this was all a test. Go ahead.
[3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:04.880]  Yeah, one of the theories is this actually was the attempt to distribute a real killer pandemic,
[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:11.520]  and it failed on them. The scientists who were engineering this virus weren't able to get it
[3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:16.320]  to mutate in the wild the way they wanted it to. That's just one theory. I don't know for
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:21.920]  sure if that's true or not. Another theory is that it was just kind of a dry run for the big one
[3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:28.080]  that's coming, because we know that there are, for example, military labs and U.S. government labs
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:31.520]  where they work on these as weapons of war. I mean, that's not necessarily true.
[3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:37.360]  Bio shield, but bio shield. But I mean, it came out that they were developing an H1N1
[3:01:37.360 --> 3:01:42.560]  quote flu virus simulant to test spread, and there have been a bunch of top scientists say
[3:01:42.560 --> 3:01:47.360]  this was clearly made in the lab. I mean, that's mainstream news. Well, yeah. Well, yeah, very
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:53.200]  clearly that that simulant that you talked about was put out there to try to test the effectiveness
[3:01:53.200 --> 3:01:57.040]  of the vaccines against it, if I remember correctly. Yes. They had structured that.
[3:01:57.040 --> 3:02:06.640]  But the simulant was a weakened H1N1. Yeah, exactly. If you look at the history,
[3:02:06.640 --> 3:02:09.840]  and I know you know this very well, but your listeners, this may be new information to them,
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:17.120]  but the history of the U.S. military testing bio weapons on civilians in the United States
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:22.960]  is a very long and detailed history. I mean, it goes way back and they would, they would
[3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:29.760]  gas or they would release biological agents on entire cities. They would inject people with
[3:02:29.760 --> 3:02:35.120]  agents without their knowledge in New York subway, nerve gassing our own troops, radiating
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:41.680]  foster children. So they're capable of this, Alex. They're capable of releasing a very
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:48.880]  dangerous, very deadly virus. But people should understand this. The most dangerous virus in
[3:02:48.880 --> 3:02:54.720]  terms of a pandemic is not the one that kills you right away. It's the virus that you can carry
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:03:00.640]  without symptoms and pass on to other people for seven to 14 days without anybody knowing that
[3:03:00.640 --> 3:03:07.440]  it's being spread. And that's usually a low mortality virus, which is exactly what H1N1 was,
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:14.480]  a low mortality virus. So they've also engineered super viruses that trigger once your hormone
[3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:19.520]  levels go down that are literally a Logan's run carousel soft kill weapon.
[3:03:20.720 --> 3:03:25.600]  That's, you know, I call it a binary vaccine. It's kind of like binary explosive. You have to
[3:03:25.600 --> 3:03:32.880]  have both elements in place and then the trigger is set off. And really bad things can happen to
[3:03:32.880 --> 3:03:38.640]  your body in those cases. But yeah, you and I both know, Alex, we, we see this behind the scenes,
[3:03:38.640 --> 3:03:43.680]  even two things that perhaps we won't even talk about publicly, but we see what they're capable
[3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:49.840]  of doing. And they are setting the stage, in my opinion, for something big to strike the U.S.,
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:55.760]  most likely a false flag attack involving biologicals. I agree with you. I think that's
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:04:01.760]  one of the main enemy operations we're focused on. Our eyes are peeled as sentinels and the
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:05.280]  public starting to wake up to just how wicked this government is. But I don't know if it's fast
[3:04:05.280 --> 3:04:10.480]  enough, Mike. I mean, people are really in for all these reporters that think it's funny and
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:15.920]  think it's cute and make fun of us. If they kill your kids, it's not our fault. We tried to warn
[3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:22.000]  you, jackasses. And, you know, I mean, I mean, this is not a game. This is not a joke. This is
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:26.880]  not a drill. We know who these people are. We know what they've done over and over again. And now
[3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:31.040]  they're gearing up to do it on a bigger scale. And people just can't believe it. Mike Adams,
[3:04:31.040 --> 3:04:37.440]  great job. Again, naturalnews.com. Thank you for the incredible work you do.
[3:04:37.440 --> 3:04:42.000]  Thank you, Alex. It's always a pleasure to join you, and I hope to do it again sometime. Take care.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:46.400]  Take care. Take care. All right, ladies and gentlemen, there he goes from Ecuador. He's
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:52.160]  escaped the main command base of the New World Order. But he's fighting back from a distance.
[3:04:52.160 --> 3:04:57.280]  More of your calls straight ahead and the latest on the gun grab in Austin, Texas. We'll be right back.
[3:04:59.840 --> 3:05:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:08.640]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:05:08.640 --> 3:05:13.600]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[3:05:13.600 --> 3:05:19.120]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[3:05:19.120 --> 3:05:24.240]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:05:24.240 --> 3:05:29.360]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:34.160]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:39.520]  weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[3:05:39.520 --> 3:05:43.360]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:49.600]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[3:06:05.040 --> 3:06:09.840]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:06:09.840 --> 3:06:15.120]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:06:15.120 --> 3:06:20.480]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[3:06:20.480 --> 3:06:24.880]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be
[3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:29.680]  any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[3:06:29.680 --> 3:06:34.320]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if
[3:06:34.320 --> 3:06:40.160]  you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:45.760]  will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of
[3:06:45.760 --> 3:06:53.760]  you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web

[3:08:06.720 --> 3:08:14.080]  because there's a war on for your mind. Stop hiding in your apartments and your farmhouses.
[3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:26.400]  Come out the 2nd Amendment in T-minus 3 hours. Downtown Austin, right off IH 35, the west side
[3:08:26.400 --> 3:08:32.960]  of 8th and 7th Street, the Austin Police Department, big, ugly brick building. You can't miss it.
[3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:39.200]  Be there. We now have the extinct gun shows in Austin. The police don't allow them. They just come in
[3:08:39.200 --> 3:08:44.720]  and tell you we're going to shut you down, threaten your landlord, then lie about it later. I read the
[3:08:44.720 --> 3:08:52.800]  BATF off their own website earlier. Unlicensed persons questions. ATF Bureau of Alcohol,
[3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:56.960]  Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Give me a close shot of this for everybody. Then I'm going to
[3:08:56.960 --> 3:09:00.800]  talk to Darwin Vettiker briefly about the protest tonight, then take some of your calls and news
[3:09:00.800 --> 3:09:05.840]  blitz. But for Mike and Anna and Jonathan and John and Angel, I wanted to be able to continue
[3:09:05.840 --> 3:09:10.080]  with what they were saying with the last guest. But I want to document Cam's shot of this. This
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:16.880]  is from atf.gov. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. To whom may an unlicensed
[3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:23.840]  person transfer firearms under the Gun Control Act? Okay. This is the law. Q. To whom, this is
[3:09:23.840 --> 3:09:29.760]  Section Q. To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA? Okay. This is the United
[3:09:29.760 --> 3:09:35.280]  States. Federal law. A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of the state if he does
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:40.000]  not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:45.680]  firearms under federal law. And then it goes on from there to further describe it. And you can
[3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:55.120]  go read it for yourself. Now, that's the facts. But I played the CBS News piece and I could play
[3:09:55.120 --> 3:10:02.720]  News 8. I could play ABC. I could play all of them. We played the CBS where they just said,
[3:10:02.720 --> 3:10:07.120]  it's the law. You got to fill it out. The police asked them. They wouldn't. They shut it down.
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:14.960]  But Alex Jones and the owner of Texas Gun Shows, Darwin Bedaker, complained that it was the last
[3:10:14.960 --> 3:10:20.720]  group that broke the law. That's another hoax. We're saying there is no law and they know there
[3:10:20.720 --> 3:10:26.880]  isn't. And then they just take clips of my show and edit it together to have me lie for them.
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:31.200]  I mean, do you see how they work? And
[3:10:34.880 --> 3:10:39.920]  it just gets worse and worse and worse. So five o'clock today, downtown Austin,
[3:10:39.920 --> 3:10:44.320]  you can't miss it. It's right off 535 on the west side, the police building. You'll see the crowd
[3:10:44.320 --> 3:10:48.080]  be there. I'm going to be there a little bit early because the media will do the trick. You watch on
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:52.160]  the news tonight. I just know what they'll do. I know exactly what Glenn Beck will do before he
[3:10:52.160 --> 3:10:55.440]  doesn't. I know what Obama's going to do before he doesn't. I know their playbook. It's like I've
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:10:59.520]  been sitting in on all their, you know, football camp training. I mean, I know when they give this
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:06.480]  signal, they're doing that. They're going to come give a bunch of people show up at 445 or so.
[3:11:07.600 --> 3:11:12.000]  A lot of people need to get there early because they're, and you've got to kind of get together
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:15.920]  and then run out in front of the cameras or, and I know they're going to do it anyways. I'm just
[3:11:15.920 --> 3:11:20.400]  doing this so we can expose them later because see, they don't even realize we're here. They don't
[3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:26.000]  even understand. They can't lie in a vacuum, but they'll show just a few people. But really,
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:31.360]  there's no way to get around their fraud because they'll misrepresent whatever we say, whatever we
[3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:35.440]  do. The point is we're there to let the police know we're going to videotape it. You should videotape
[3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:40.560]  it. We'll put it on YouTube. It'll reach millions of people and that's how we do it. And then we'll
[3:11:40.560 --> 3:11:43.920]  make videos showing how the media, even if they get there when there's a big crowd, they'll show
[3:11:43.920 --> 3:11:47.760]  the corner of the crowd and say there were five people there. And then we'll expose them on that.
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:54.000]  Like with the tea parties when there was a million in DC, the DC park police said, and the media said
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:59.040]  2000. That's why the media is going bankrupt. That's why the newspapers are bankrupt. That's
[3:11:59.040 --> 3:12:03.280]  why nobody wants to read what they have to say because people know they're a pack of liars.
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:08.720]  Now, I haven't talked to him since last week. I don't know if you saw these newscasts that were
[3:12:08.720 --> 3:12:13.680]  just pure frauds, but we have them up on info wars.com and prison planet.com. But Darwin Bettecker,
[3:12:13.680 --> 3:12:19.680]  uh, who just through racketeering at run out of town, they're now going, Oh, we did have a law
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:24.880]  nuisance abatement. Like it's a crack house. That's what we threatened to be with the crack
[3:12:24.880 --> 3:12:30.880]  house law. I've read it. It doesn't apply to this. It's just total fraud. The Austin police admit
[3:12:30.880 --> 3:12:37.440]  the B A T F E told them this is part of Obama's program. This is Obama. This is the justice
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:45.360]  department told Austin police to do this. I mean, it's horrible and it sets a precedent for the
[3:12:45.360 --> 3:12:52.000]  entire country. In fact, give me the phone number of K I want people to call them and let them know
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:57.520]  we saw the piece and know their liars and get me the phone and facts. So I want people to
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:13:02.960]  fax them this B A T F document. And I also want to give out the Austin police department,
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:07.920]  non-emergency number, not three, one, one. I know that I want to give out their regular
[3:13:09.040 --> 3:13:15.120]  number. No, you know what? Let's go right at the top city council. Give me the mayor's phone number.
[3:13:16.880 --> 3:13:21.440]  The mayor's phone number. That's coming up. Okay. I better see you all out there folks. Come on. We
[3:13:21.440 --> 3:13:25.200]  don't have a lot of time. I heard locals were planning a protest. I don't want it to be 15 people
[3:13:25.200 --> 3:13:29.840]  out there. I want hundreds and hundreds to come. We had time. We'd have thousands. I mean, I just
[3:13:29.840 --> 3:13:33.920]  heard about this last night. I'm going to be there. Believe me, I got work. Paul, the rafters,
[3:13:33.920 --> 3:13:38.000]  I'm going to come back and work on police state for the rise of FEMA after this event tonight.
[3:13:39.840 --> 3:13:44.480]  Won't be any good time going to restaurant for me because we got to fight for this Republic.
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:48.960]  All right, going to Darwin, Vettiker Darwin. Did you see the local newscast?
[3:13:49.840 --> 3:13:53.120]  I have seen some of them out. Yes. What did you think of it?
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:14:00.960]  I was kind of thinking to buy it. I haven't really watched any other one. Well, I just read
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:05.280]  the BATF. I just read the law. Maybe we should hand copies of this out to the cops.
[3:14:06.160 --> 3:14:07.920]  I think that'd be a good idea. Absolutely.
[3:14:10.160 --> 3:14:12.400]  Well, what's this been like for you being run on a business?
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:18.080]  Well, I mean, it's horrible. I mean, I only have, you know, two share locations. Now I have one.
[3:14:18.080 --> 3:14:23.200]  I am in the process of trying to find a new building in Austin because I'm not going to
[3:14:23.200 --> 3:14:28.800]  let them win. But I mean, financially, you know, it's, you know, cut my business and over half.
[3:14:28.800 --> 3:14:32.960]  Austin was a good show for me. I enjoyed all the people that used to come out.
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:40.720]  And, you know, that whole side of my business has just, you know, gone away overnight. So, I mean,
[3:14:40.720 --> 3:14:48.720]  it's, it's, uh, it's devastating, but you know that they may have won, they may have won the battle,
[3:14:48.720 --> 3:14:50.480]  but they haven't won the war. So I mean, I'll be back. I'll be back and I'll find a new building
[3:14:50.480 --> 3:14:54.240]  and it'll be better, uh, bigger and better than it was, uh, before all this.
[3:14:54.240 --> 3:15:00.480]  But then they'll come again. So that's why we have to rally, rally the forces.
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:05.360]  You know, I was talking to a police officer in, in, uh, Pennsylvania. I was Ohio. He reminded
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:09.760]  me of cases a few years ago where they tried this. And so they just printed out handouts
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:14.960]  about your rules and that it can be a private sale, but you want to see a driver's license,
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:20.080]  you know, if private person that they need to show a driver's license, that way private
[3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:22.400]  citizens can do it because they're going to be running stings again.
[3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:27.360]  Yeah. And you know, my, my, my philosophy is that, you know, if you, if you want to keep
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:31.440]  illegal aliens from buying guns at a gun show, you know, secure the border, you know, if you
[3:15:31.440 --> 3:15:34.560]  want to keep felons from buying guns at a gun show, don't let them out of jail.
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:38.960]  You know, that they're the ones, they're the ones that have broke the law to come to the
[3:15:38.960 --> 3:15:43.200]  show. Not the people that are there at the show, not the law by the citizens that this
[3:15:43.200 --> 3:15:47.440]  is a swamp meat and they're going to get rid of the right for a father to give a son his gun.
[3:15:47.440 --> 3:15:54.640]  That's what these bills say. Yeah. And then it's, it's the crock. I mean, it, it's frustrating,
[3:15:54.640 --> 3:15:58.800]  but you know, that when you have a bunch of people that are just yes, man, and you know,
[3:15:58.800 --> 3:16:03.360]  any order that they're given, they just follow without, you know, without thought to, uh,
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:07.840]  to what's right or wrong. I mean, it's frustrating. Well, I didn't know you broken your collar bone
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:11.920]  a few weeks ago, but you're still going to be up here in Austin today. You're coming up from
[3:16:11.920 --> 3:16:16.640]  San Antonio. Yes, sir. I, uh, I broke it two weeks ago in Colorado, but yeah, I'll still,
[3:16:16.640 --> 3:16:20.240]  I'm still coming up there today and, uh, I'm not even going to, I'm not even going to wear
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:24.080]  my sling because I don't want to, I don't want to put on a show, you know, for people thinking
[3:16:24.080 --> 3:16:29.040]  that, that I'm playing in the whimper role, but, uh, yeah, I'll be up there. You should wear your
[3:16:29.040 --> 3:16:35.040]  sling, man. You don't want to hurt your shoulder again. I know. I broke, I've broken other bones
[3:16:35.040 --> 3:16:38.320]  that I've done, you know, blown out knees and stuff like that, and nothing hurts as bad as a collar
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:45.280]  bone. That's weird. Were you skiing? Yeah, I was snowboarding and that's why, that's why fat boys
[3:16:45.280 --> 3:16:51.200]  don't belong on snowboards. Now, did you sign a license to do that? Maybe we should ban snowboarding.
[3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:56.320]  No, I didn't sign a license or a waiver and believe it or not, there wouldn't, you know,
[3:16:56.320 --> 3:16:59.280]  people out there protesting against snowboarding. So it's kind of funny.
[3:16:59.280 --> 3:17:06.000]  Well, life is dangerous. Freedom is dangerous, but tyranny is a lot more dangerous. And we're
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:09.680]  going to be standing beside you today. Hopefully you can get there by five o'clock, my friend.
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:16.080]  I'll be there by 430. Well, that's good because the media is going to be sneaking around out there.
[3:17:17.200 --> 3:17:21.200]  Yeah, I know they will. I'm bringing some friends up from San Antonio, some are
[3:17:21.200 --> 3:17:26.560]  current police officers here in San Antonio, some are ex-police officers. So I'll, you know,
[3:17:26.560 --> 3:17:30.480]  I'm bringing, bringing some support down from San Antonio. Everybody that thinks, you know,
[3:17:30.480 --> 3:17:34.560]  what happened and they know me personally, they know what kind of person I am, but they're,
[3:17:34.560 --> 3:17:38.320]  they're going to be there to show their support also. And I hope we can. Well, good. And we do
[3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:44.080]  need to remember that, that again, I've seen the national poll of law enforcement, 98% are against
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:49.040]  gun control. They're not stupid. It's the leadership that's bad. It's not the rank and file officer.
[3:17:49.040 --> 3:17:54.720]  They absolutely hate what's happening. Absolutely. And if I could, I'd like to be able to
[3:17:54.720 --> 3:17:58.320]  mention our website again. We got it up and running to where we, you know, people want to
[3:17:58.320 --> 3:18:01.920]  feel like they want to donate towards the cause for the legal actions that are going to come.
[3:18:03.120 --> 3:18:05.760]  And you are going to carry out legal actions if you get the money.
[3:18:06.400 --> 3:18:10.640]  Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it needs to be done. I'm just not in a position to where,
[3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:16.080]  you know, I can, I can go at it, you know, alone. Absolutely. Give us the website.
[3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:26.000]  It's www.texasgunshows.net. Texas gunshows.net. You also have a petition up there. Tell us about
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:29.600]  that. Yeah, the petition we're doing is an online petition. We're going to try to get
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:36.080]  hopefully 150,000 signatures on there. We're on our way. And as soon as we reach that goal,
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:40.560]  we're going to submit it to the attorney general. And that's to have the attorney general crack down
[3:18:40.560 --> 3:18:48.080]  on these lawless people here in Austin. Yes, sir. Well, this is a big issue. And I hope they know
[3:18:48.080 --> 3:18:52.800]  Deborah Medina is looking at bringing it up in the debate. So this is becoming a bigger and bigger
[3:18:52.800 --> 3:18:56.960]  issue. And just because they had KI live for them, I mean, that's only going to make this worse for
[3:18:56.960 --> 3:19:02.000]  them. Well, you know, I saw the clip of when the gentleman questioned Rick Perry at the,
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:08.640]  his junk at there at that gun range. And, and it was kind of, it was kind of disheartening and
[3:19:08.640 --> 3:19:12.720]  stinking at the same time when he asked them, you know, straight out, you know, how do you feel
[3:19:12.720 --> 3:19:17.120]  about, you know, what happened to the gun show? And, and what, what do you suggest in those first
[3:19:17.120 --> 3:19:22.160]  words where, you know, he should find another venue, like, you know, like, like he was just
[3:19:22.160 --> 3:19:26.960]  going to brush it off to the side, but then the gentleman kept on with it. And he said, well,
[3:19:26.960 --> 3:19:32.960]  you know, there's a lot of he said, she said going on and there's notice the governor knows about
[3:19:32.960 --> 3:19:37.760]  this. And there isn't any, he said, she said, the police now are admitting they're trying a
[3:19:37.760 --> 3:19:41.600]  nuisance abatement on this. In fact, I didn't even know Rick Perry got confronted. I heard it
[3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:46.800]  happened, but I didn't, what's the name of the video? I was a YouTube clip. I mean, I'm sure
[3:19:46.800 --> 3:19:50.240]  you could just get on there and do a search. Rick, Rick Perry question on Austin gun show,
[3:19:50.240 --> 3:19:54.560]  this gets better and better. Send it to Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo. Let's get it up on infowars.com.
[3:19:54.560 --> 3:19:58.800]  I'll see you in about two and a half hours, my friend here in Austin.
[3:20:01.440 --> 3:20:05.920]  America is in deep, deep trouble because we don't know our rights. Let's get real
[3:20:05.920 --> 3:20:10.560]  freedom back into America by teaching and promoting the bill of rights with the 2010
[3:20:10.560 --> 3:20:15.840]  freedom calendar. Why? Because our forefathers gave them to us because the freedom calendar is true
[3:20:15.840 --> 3:20:21.760]  patriotism in action. And because if you don't know your rights and use them, you may lose them.
[3:20:21.760 --> 3:20:26.880]  The freedom calendar is the best educational tool in over 200 years. It shows in detail how to use
[3:20:26.880 --> 3:20:31.120]  your rights, how to answer any bureaucrat, how to use your guaranteed rights for true freedom.

[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:08.720]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:21:08.720 --> 3:21:13.840]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[3:21:13.840 --> 3:21:19.920]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:26.320]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:21:26.320 --> 3:21:31.760]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[3:21:31.760 --> 3:21:36.400]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:21:36.400 --> 3:21:41.520]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying
[3:21:41.520 --> 3:21:46.160]  who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington,
[3:21:46.160 --> 3:21:53.200]  D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[3:22:01.760 --> 3:22:06.160]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier
[3:22:06.160 --> 3:22:10.960]  gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the
[3:22:10.960 --> 3:22:15.920]  government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout
[3:22:15.920 --> 3:22:20.640]  candy that social security would be there for you. That's not what's happening. You might even
[3:22:20.640 --> 3:22:26.320]  pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value
[3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:31.440]  or that your retirement would be secure. If all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy
[3:22:31.440 --> 3:22:37.120]  gold. For the realists there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001
[3:22:37.120 --> 3:22:43.920]  the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%. Right now savvy investors are adding
[3:22:43.920 --> 3:22:48.800]  gold to their portfolios. You should too. Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send you 10
[3:22:48.800 --> 3:22:59.520]  reasons why gold will do very well free. 800-686-2237. 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.

[3:23:57.040 --> 3:24:04.400]  Powervapor.com, the smoking gun heard around the world. The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[3:24:04.400 --> 3:24:12.080]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind. People can't
[3:24:12.080 --> 3:24:17.280]  believe the level of lying. They can't believe that every TV station in Austin lied and said,
[3:24:17.280 --> 3:24:21.840]  oh, the gun show got shut down because they were selling guns illegally. You can't sell guns privately
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:26.800]  when that's not the law. Then the police said, oh, well, we didn't threaten a nuisance abatement.
[3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:31.840]  Now they admit they did. They ran off the last guy. The new guy came in to take it over. They
[3:24:31.840 --> 3:24:37.040]  just shut him down. It's now a big national issue and you got to love it. I'd heard Rick
[3:24:37.040 --> 3:24:42.720]  Perry got confronted and I just last night, I didn't look it up. I was busy taking care of my kids
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:51.280]  and when I got home late at night and then we pull up the video. It's going up on infowars.com
[3:24:51.280 --> 3:24:57.760]  and prisonplanet.com and it's infowars.com cameraman. He also does talk radio and TV sometimes
[3:24:57.760 --> 3:25:07.120]  locally. Richard Reeves and Richard Reeves went to Reds rifle range where I do some shooting
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:13.440]  sometimes nice folks and talked to Rick Perry and at the end, Perry said, look, if they do it again
[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:18.240]  in a new location, now it's harassment and that's racketeering. When powerful people, government
[3:25:18.240 --> 3:25:21.760]  or mafia do this kind of stuff, it's called racketeering. It's called extortion. It's called
[3:25:21.760 --> 3:25:28.960]  intimidation. It's very illegal. And when a civil rights involved, whoo. Now, here's the governor
[3:25:28.960 --> 3:25:35.520]  Arte Cerveta and BATF. Here's the governor. Now he hadn't gotten to the bottom of all your lies yet,
[3:25:35.520 --> 3:25:43.120]  but he likes the political issue to make himself look good to Texans. And I'm telling you,
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:46.080]  I'm telling you, your lion is catching up with you. Here's Rick Perry.
[3:25:46.080 --> 3:25:53.360]  I had at least one more question about the gun show issue. Robert explained earlier,
[3:25:53.360 --> 3:25:57.840]  my understanding is, is that the gun show owner has not voluntarily given up his gun show. What
[3:25:57.840 --> 3:26:04.800]  has happened evidently is a combination of APD and or BATFE has gone and talked to the landlord
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:10.000]  of the building. Okay, it's supposed to be HB, right? And that HB has come to the gun show owner
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:14.400]  said, Hey, your gun show is off. You're done. And my understanding is that the gun show has done
[3:26:14.400 --> 3:26:19.600]  nothing wrong if they've been convicted over or anything like that. That's my understanding too.
[3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:25.680]  And my advice is find another venue and find another venue. Sure. Is it okay that the feds
[3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:29.200]  come in and pressure the landlord like that? I don't think that's fine at all. My deal is though,
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:34.080]  until we get that all cleared up, because I mean, there's a lot of he said, she said here that I
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:40.640]  don't know what the facts are. But if the issue is HB won't let you have that site, I'll bet you
[3:26:40.640 --> 3:26:45.600]  there's somebody in this city that would barely love to say, well, I agree that's true. Here's what
[3:26:45.600 --> 3:26:49.600]  here's what and then go forward. If they try it again, at that particular point in time,
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:53.520]  not a lawyer, but I got to start saying that harassment's getting in play here. Well,
[3:26:56.640 --> 3:27:01.520]  all right, there goes Governor Rick Perry. Little nicer to Richard than he was when he was on my
[3:27:01.520 --> 3:27:10.320]  show that time. Call me a big fat hog on here. But hey, whatever. Not all of us are like twinkle
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:18.080]  toes. But look, the point is very exciting to see that because you heard the governor, he's saying
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:23.200]  that that's his understanding. He agrees with us. But after it gets sorted out, looks like harassment
[3:27:24.560 --> 3:27:32.080]  of your civil rights and of people's business. So this is huge news. This is absolutely gigantic
[3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:40.800]  news right now to have this going on, to have this to have this happening. So
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:47.440]  this is getting more and more serious by the minute for the establishment that has been
[3:27:47.440 --> 3:27:52.000]  caught doing this come out today. Let them know you're not putting up with it. I want to give you
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:57.920]  Greg Abbott, the attorney general of the great state of Texas. And I want you to call Greg Abbott
[3:27:57.920 --> 3:28:04.640]  and I want you to tell him the facts have been found. It's all on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[3:28:04.640 --> 3:28:10.880]  The APD has now put out a press release and they admit that the Justice Department told
[3:28:10.880 --> 3:28:15.680]  them to do this and get the Justice Department out of Texas. They have no law, no statutory
[3:28:15.680 --> 3:28:24.000]  authority. 512 right here in Austin, Capitol down the street. 512-463-2100. That's the attorney
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:29.040]  general's number. Call him, be polite, but be focused and say you better do something about
[3:28:29.040 --> 3:28:38.480]  this or we're going to vote you out. 512-463-2100. 512-463-2100. Greg Abbott, go right to the
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:42.800]  top. We're going right to Governor Perry. We're going right to the attorney general. Now,
[3:28:44.160 --> 3:28:50.400]  you call Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell and you let him know that the city of Austin is going to
[3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:55.200]  have the attorney general examining all the illegal stuff they're doing. And then he better get out
[3:28:55.200 --> 3:29:00.560]  ahead of this and apologize right now and tell R.A. Savannah to knock it off, though he's got
[3:29:00.560 --> 3:29:07.120]  R.S. Savannah vampirically running around with illegal checkpoints taking blood. 512-974-2250.
[3:29:07.120 --> 3:29:21.040]  That's Lee Leffingwell. 512-974-2250. Facts, 512-974-2337. And fax them, the BATF law.
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:27.040]  They've got it on their own site saying it's not illegal. It's section Q. In fact, I showed that
[3:29:27.040 --> 3:29:32.560]  to you earlier. Here's section Q right here. ATF Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
[3:29:32.560 --> 3:29:37.360]  Explosives, Unlicensed Person Questions to Whom an Unlicensed Person Transfer Firearms under the GCA.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:46.960]  And you send them section Q. Facts it to them right now. 512-974-2337. And fax the attorney general as well.

[3:31:42.800 --> 3:31:49.120]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the

[3:32:32.240 --> 3:32:37.920]  we will still have two regrets. We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food
[3:32:37.920 --> 3:32:43.840]  sooner. We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food. Putting off emergency food
[3:32:43.840 --> 3:32:48.080]  preparations will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.

[3:33:08.240 --> 3:33:12.800]  Foreign Offshore Corporations are attempting to take this nation over. We're standing up and saying no.
[3:33:12.800 --> 3:33:19.280]  It's our birthright. It's our right to free sentient beings and we're doing it together.
[3:33:19.280 --> 3:33:22.560]  We're going to stand together 5 to 7 p.m. in front of the Austin Police Department
[3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:27.920]  right off 8th Street and I-35 on the west side. Be sure and join us today, 5 o'clock. I'll be there.
[3:33:29.520 --> 3:33:34.240]  I want to talk to Mike and Jonathan, John and Angel. I'm taking those five callers that have
[3:33:34.240 --> 3:33:37.360]  been holding the longest. Then I'm going to blitz through some final news. A lot of it I meant to
[3:33:37.360 --> 3:33:42.400]  get to. It's all incredibly important. Got a bunch of huge guests throughout the week. There's just
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:48.000]  so much happening. But this federal power grab that affects every gun show, every gun owner,
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:52.160]  every private transfer of firearms is so important. We've been spending a lot of time on it.
[3:33:53.200 --> 3:33:58.400]  And the people are on the march right now. The people are waking up. Look at how what
[3:33:58.400 --> 3:34:02.880]  happened in Massachusetts to Kennedy's seat. I mean, globalists know the people are angry.
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:07.680]  That's why Rick Perry's talking like me now. Glenn Beck's doing it. The problem is we got
[3:34:07.680 --> 3:34:12.400]  to hold their feet to the fire. Look at how Deborah Medina is surging in all the polls now.
[3:34:12.400 --> 3:34:16.080]  They weren't going to let her in the next debate. People started boycotting Milo. They let her in
[3:34:17.600 --> 3:34:23.920]  because she's surging in the polls. This is really happening, ladies and gentlemen. And people are
[3:34:23.920 --> 3:34:29.040]  discovering like George Washington at Trenton with that one little victory that we can win,
[3:34:29.040 --> 3:34:36.480]  that resistance is victory. I'm going to go to your calls here in just a moment. First,
[3:34:36.480 --> 3:34:39.840]  I want to say about a few of the sponsors, the sponsors that make this radio show possible.

[3:35:27.120 --> 3:35:32.000]  on? If so, you should check out my solar back up.com because there's never been a better time to
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:36.240]  start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electricity. Here's why plug and play
[3:35:36.240 --> 3:35:39.920]  solar generators are now available. Yeah, for the last year, our listeners love them from solutions
[3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:44.000]  from science. These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current,
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:48.320]  whatever they're needed, producing electricity directly from the sun and then storing it.
[3:35:48.320 --> 3:35:52.240]  Unlike gas generators and solar generators run quietly and emit no fumes. It's like having
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:56.880]  your own electric power plant and it's perfect for your home or your campsite or your shop or
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:36:06.320]  whatever the case may be. Go to mysolarbackup.com or do a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[3:36:06.320 --> 3:36:12.880]  That's mysolarbackup.com. The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so take action today.
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:19.840]  And lastly, I had a reporter last night again talking to me and he was like,
[3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:22.880]  so you really believe in me and prepared? You really believe in storeable food? And I said,
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:27.840]  well, yeah, I've got a whole bunch of it myself. There could be a depression, a war, a bio-release,
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:32.400]  the government hoards food and weapons. I mean, I do that because I want to be secure. I want to
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:37.520]  provide for my little ones and my wife. The old timers did it. We just have been domesticated.
[3:36:37.520 --> 3:36:43.360]  I'm not domesticated. I'm like a squirrel that buries some nuts and these are the highest quality.
[3:36:43.360 --> 3:36:47.760]  I mean, look at their website for prisonplanet.tv viewers. I mean, it's, they've got ready to eat
[3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:52.960]  meals, gourmet, super inexpensive, going directly to the person that manufactures it,
[3:36:52.960 --> 3:36:56.560]  the people that prepare it all. They're just wonderful folks and they're patriots. They're
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:36:59.920]  the real deal. The people you need to get your storeable foods from, efoodsdirect.com.

[3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:12.560]  Okay. Let's sing now through your calls quickly. So I want to talk to you, but I got other stuff
[3:37:12.560 --> 3:37:20.000]  we got to cover here. Let's go to Mike in Jersey. You're on the air, Mike. Alex, big time. Long
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:23.760]  time listener, first time caller. I appreciate everything you're doing. Two things. Number
[3:37:23.760 --> 3:37:29.920]  one, we need to wake the people up in the northeast of the United States. You've had to train all the
[3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:35.680]  other parts of the country pretty much except for Southern California and northeast. And I'm doing
[3:37:35.680 --> 3:37:40.080]  my best to get you out there, but we need to get you on some radio stations out here besides the
[3:37:40.080 --> 3:37:44.720]  coast-to-coast to get your message across. Number two, just got done reading Sheets of
[3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:49.760]  Deception by Jeffrey M. Smith. Totally changed my life and enlightened me. Well, I mean,
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:56.640]  he doesn't want to get sued. So it's a textbook with all their own documents. I mean, it's what
[3:37:56.640 --> 3:38:03.040]  they say. Read. Yes, such an easy read, but yes, we hear about the problems with R-Pod Poustai
[3:38:03.040 --> 3:38:07.840]  and Shapara and what they went through. I can't believe that people don't realize the
[3:38:07.840 --> 3:38:12.880]  nutricide that's going on. I would love for you to take five days. You just mentioned scientists
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:18.080]  who were making millions a year running giant firms and said, my God, half the rats are dying.
[3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:23.040]  This is deadly. And they said, shut up. It goes to the people. Right between the new leaf potatoes
[3:38:23.040 --> 3:38:27.680]  and the flavor saver tomatoes. Are you kidding me? Yeah. Yeah. 40% of the rats die. Let's go
[3:38:27.680 --> 3:38:32.320]  ahead and approve it. Well, more than that. Well, 40 died pretty much immediately. The others had
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:36.800]  degenerative and it reduced their lifespans by half. I'm going from memory. So that's basically
[3:38:36.800 --> 3:38:41.200]  a soft kill weapon. Right. And they had the lesions in the stomach. What I would love for you to do
[3:38:41.200 --> 3:38:46.320]  is you can do it. Which they now call Crohn's. Everybody's getting Crohn's. Right. If you could
[3:38:46.320 --> 3:38:53.200]  have five days with the nutricide side of it, with Dr. Rima Leibow, maybe Dr. Jeffrey M. Smith,
[3:38:53.200 --> 3:38:57.120]  maybe having the Mike Ranger back on five days of the nutricide aspect of it. Because I really
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:01.680]  think besides the coming from this, from all different fronts, the food aspect is going to
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:05.440]  be the most important because if they can damage us from the inside, we're not going to be able
[3:39:05.440 --> 3:39:08.800]  to fight. I agree. I agree. In fact, since you mentioned that, I appreciate your call.
[3:39:09.760 --> 3:39:14.320]  Guys, give me a document, Tam shot, please. I want to show prisonplanet.tv viewers this,
[3:39:14.320 --> 3:39:20.160]  but for radio listeners, just go to the search engine and type in poison and progress, Wall
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:27.200]  Street Journal. And this is talking about terrorist and criminals, how they can put soft kill
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:35.600]  chemicals into your food and kill you months if not years. Like one way they've been thousands
[3:39:35.600 --> 3:39:39.680]  of murders that's come out in the last few decades, mainly women, women like to poison in
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:44.640]  criminology. Men do it too, but men generally kill people more often than women. It's many
[3:39:44.640 --> 3:39:53.600]  times more often, but women generally poison and, and it talks about that and they slowly put
[3:39:53.600 --> 3:40:00.240]  it small amounts of antifreeze in your drinks. You can't taste it. It's actually sweet.
[3:40:01.520 --> 3:40:09.040]  Poison and progress, modern science race to stay ahead of global terrorist and political
[3:40:09.040 --> 3:40:14.960]  assassins begin with some devious poisoners in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:20.880]  My guess was one of the most successful poison killers to belong to the era. Historians call
[3:40:20.880 --> 3:40:25.760]  the golden age of poisoning and it goes into how a woman would put something in your beer that
[3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:30.880]  would kill you a month later and thus began a deadly cat and mouse game. In 2005, the National
[3:40:30.880 --> 3:40:37.680]  Academy of Sciences warned the US milk supply was vulnerable target. Folks, the FDA, everybody's
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:42.000]  dying in China, dying here. So they just said, you know what, we're not going to get the melamine,
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:47.040]  the liquid plastic out of your food that destroys your kidneys and liver. We're just going to say
[3:40:47.040 --> 3:40:52.960]  in small amounts, it's okay, but it's cumulative and it's in 90%. In fact, people won't believe it.
[3:40:52.960 --> 3:40:59.920]  Google 90% of formula had melamine. Give me that for viewers. People won't believe it until they
[3:40:59.920 --> 3:41:06.320]  say it. And then the FDA says melamine not bad for you. So just like they say, mercury's not
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:11.120]  bad now. Oh, you found out we're putting mercury in and it's not bad. It's good. Oh, you found out
[3:41:11.120 --> 3:41:15.600]  melamine's killing people. Don't listen to the Chinese with thousands dying. No, it's good for
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:28.160]  your baby. There you go. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep, little baby. La, la, la. Take your
[3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:38.560]  mercury shot. Eat your Monsanto corn too. You'll be brain damaged and you won't be able to think,
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:45.200]  but that's what we do because we love you. Yeah. Health Ranger article came up. That was
[3:41:45.200 --> 3:41:50.800]  actually in the Associated Press. 90% of US infant formula may be contaminated with melamine. FDA
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:56.080]  abruptly declares chemicals safe for babies, but people won't believe Mike Adams. Give me an AP.
[3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:03.920]  FDA says melamine not harmful. And then go research melamine.
[3:42:06.960 --> 3:42:11.040]  I mean, this is the information we know every day. I have to sit here and know this
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:14.800]  and then have the mainstream media who thinks they're part of the system go along with it and
[3:42:14.800 --> 3:42:22.000]  think that we're lying about this. Let's go to Annie in New York. Annie, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:42:22.880 --> 3:42:27.520]  Thank you, Alex. This is quick and it was for Mike Adams, but as you know, here in New York,
[3:42:27.520 --> 3:42:31.520]  we have the state health commissioner, Richard Gaines, level of decree that all healthcare
[3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:37.600]  workers get the flu shot or be fired and that he backed down the very day that it was revealed
[3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:43.120]  that his wife and daughter both worked at Goldman Sachs, which brokered billions of dollars in deals
[3:42:43.120 --> 3:42:48.800]  for vaccine makers. Oh, it's always Goldman Sachs. Oh, it's unbelievable. Go ahead. And so how do we,
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:56.240]  you know, how do we bring these people to justice? They are. Hitler was evil. Stalin was evil. Mao
[3:42:56.240 --> 3:43:02.080]  was evil. Julius Caesar was evil. I mean, people can't believe evil crazies get in control. They
[3:43:02.080 --> 3:43:09.680]  think it's funny. Rick Perry's elected officials. Rick Perry's party got massive money from Merck
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:14.320]  to, to, to, to say girls must take Gardasil. Then the death started mounting everywhere
[3:43:14.320 --> 3:43:18.960]  and they had to back out. I mean, they're killing us folks. And the average cowardly person just
[3:43:18.960 --> 3:43:24.000]  can't believe it. I mean, they just can't believe. I mean, I mean, I tell reporters that Cass Sunstein
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:29.040]  is calling for restricting the first amendment and they just don't believe it. I talked to reporters
[3:43:29.040 --> 3:43:33.680]  every week. I talked to like four or five newspaper magazine reporters in the last week
[3:43:33.680 --> 3:43:38.160]  and just none of them can get it. They just, they just cannot get it. They know the government's
[3:43:38.160 --> 3:43:43.120]  corrupt. Oh, they'll admit that, but they just can't get it. They can't get it. They don't want to
[3:43:43.120 --> 3:43:49.680]  get it. Don't they love their children enough to check into the claims I'm making? Well, you know
[3:43:49.680 --> 3:43:54.880]  what, Alex? I think they've put their fingers in too many pies or, you know, there are too many
[3:43:54.880 --> 3:44:00.000]  holes in the dyke. The money's running out. The people are losing their sense of humor. They'll
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:05.600]  figure it out once, you know, like all of these investments of the people's money in New York,
[3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:11.600]  the retirement funds with these like old men's backs. Oh yeah. I'm getting emails every day
[3:44:11.600 --> 3:44:16.320]  and I see articles every day going, Alex, I heard you five years ago, say they changed the law to
[3:44:16.320 --> 3:44:20.400]  take pension funds. I didn't believe you. They just took mine. Oh, you're all people out there
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:24.320]  into now. You're going to find out real good. We could have stopped them earlier, but it's going
[3:44:24.320 --> 3:44:30.240]  to get real painful now because you didn't wake up. Now, if we wake up now, we can stop a lot of
[3:44:30.240 --> 3:44:35.600]  the pain, but it's only going to get worse and worse and worse. If people don't find their
[3:44:36.240 --> 3:44:43.040]  guts again and get angry and get focused and say, no, no, no, Annie, I appreciate your call.
[3:44:44.800 --> 3:44:47.040]  I am really wound up today.
[3:44:50.080 --> 3:44:56.160]  We're the same people and all these other people saying, oh, no, so it kills the rats, eat it.
[3:44:56.160 --> 3:45:00.880]  Oh, so melamine's killing people. That's not bad. And mercury's not bad. It's good.
[3:45:00.880 --> 3:45:05.120]  And fluoride's in your water. And every time I talk to a reporter, they laugh at me and go,
[3:45:05.120 --> 3:45:09.280]  Dr. Strangelove made fun of people that think the water is poison. You know,
[3:45:09.280 --> 3:45:15.840]  you're Jack T. Ripper. You want to nuke everyone. I'm like, no. All these top scientists in the
[3:45:15.840 --> 3:45:22.480]  head of the EPA's, the CPA's union. In fact, I keep saying, get him. Can somebody email me
[3:45:22.480 --> 3:45:25.920]  because I've told my producers and I just didn't happen because they were overworked doing a great
[3:45:25.920 --> 3:45:32.880]  job. But I had him on about two years ago. It was big news. Let's try to Google it right now.
[3:45:33.680 --> 3:45:40.400]  EPA scientists send letter to their bosses saying, take fluoride out. EPA scientists
[3:45:40.400 --> 3:45:47.360]  send letter to bosses on fluoride. Try that. And it was over 90%. I remember the, I mean,
[3:45:47.360 --> 3:45:52.320]  they got most of the scientists. It was, it was, I want to say it was thousands. I mean, this is
[3:45:52.320 --> 3:45:59.200]  two years ago. I want to check it. And I've had these scientists on toxicologists. You name it.
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:02.880]  And they're like, oh my God, yes, we didn't know when I was going to college that we thought it
[3:46:02.880 --> 3:46:07.360]  was just calcium fluoride for your teeth. They call it fluoride. It's hundreds of chemicals
[3:46:07.360 --> 3:46:13.280]  under that name that's deadly. And they won't get it out of my water in Austin. Even if I
[3:46:13.280 --> 3:46:18.640]  drink filtered water, the showers have it. Fluorides, one of the smallest particles on the
[3:46:18.640 --> 3:46:25.680]  periodic chart, periodic table, it goes through almost everything. You know, again, they're
[3:46:25.680 --> 3:46:30.320]  playing God with everyone. Oh, but Bill Gates wants to help us with the vaccines. Oh, yes,
[3:46:30.320 --> 3:46:36.960]  he does. Oh, he wouldn't want to hurt us. Jonathan in Kansas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:46:36.960 --> 3:46:46.240]  Yes. Would you mind if I got into some propaganda placement? Sure. Yeah. So I,
[3:46:46.800 --> 3:46:53.040]  I checked up at game, uh, Call of Duty Modern Warfare two and two to be the government stage
[3:46:53.040 --> 3:47:01.760]  false flag attacks. Yes, well, that and multiplayer. They have you using AC 130s predator drones.
[3:47:01.760 --> 3:47:09.040]  And if you kill enough certain amount of people, you get titled genocidal. If you kill, uh,
[3:47:09.920 --> 3:47:16.880]  uh, you get also titles saying dictator. And you get to be a riot too. You get a riot shield
[3:47:16.880 --> 3:47:22.240]  and you, if you kill people with the riot shield, it's called riot control. You get points from that.
[3:47:23.840 --> 3:47:27.600]  And this is how they're doing. Yes, I've seen it. I think I meant to play video of it a few
[3:47:27.600 --> 3:47:32.720]  months ago when it came out and sold $500 million worth in a week or something. I think it's even
[3:47:32.720 --> 3:47:38.400]  more than that now, uh, bigger than any movie and bigger than avatar. Uh, and the whole, the whole
[3:47:38.400 --> 3:47:42.880]  thing is simulating killing your fellow humans and all the studies show until you don't mind
[3:47:42.880 --> 3:47:46.640]  seeing dead humans. That's why people see a puppy dog getting hurt or it's outraged,
[3:47:46.640 --> 3:47:51.440]  tens of thousands of phone calls, freakouts, because we haven't dehumanized animals yet. We
[3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:56.160]  haven't been desensitized to kill animals. And so they put our normal paternal maternal,
[3:47:56.160 --> 3:48:01.200]  paternal instinct onto animals. That's the eugenicist model, but then not on humans. I appreciate
[3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:06.880]  your call. Okay. Here it is. Organic consumers association. EPA scientists and workers call
[3:48:06.880 --> 3:48:12.880]  for an end to water fluoridation because of cancer risk. August 30th, 2005. Now that's when
[3:48:12.880 --> 3:48:17.920]  I did it again. Let's set some of these people up next week. Now here's the actual NTEU, the
[3:48:17.920 --> 3:48:22.960]  National Treasury Employees Union, why EPA headquarters union of scientists opposes
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:27.760]  fluoridation. I told a reporter about this yesterday and he literally looked right through
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:34.160]  me like I was a pumpkin head liar because the scientists, you know, they're not like
[3:48:34.160 --> 3:48:38.400]  Dr. Strange Love. They're not like general Jack T. Ripper. They know it's nutritious
[3:48:38.400 --> 3:48:44.960]  because nanny government only helps us. Oh God. I just can't even handle it anymore.
[3:48:47.520 --> 3:48:51.200]  Yeah, there's their statement on screen right now. I mean, I just, you know,
[3:48:51.200 --> 3:48:57.040]  I just, you know, it's painful to be around these reporters, even if they're nice people.
[3:48:57.040 --> 3:49:03.360]  That's what makes it worse is they really think, they really think we're crazy and they're normal
[3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:08.240]  and they don't understand. They don't know. They don't, they're, or they say, well, you're just
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:12.720]  taking the news you want. What do you mean the news I want? They've been telling us for two years,
[3:49:12.720 --> 3:49:16.400]  the economy's gotten better. They've been telling us there's been a recovery. Absolute bull.
[3:49:16.400 --> 3:49:22.720]  The government cooks the numbers and unemployment to 10.2. It's 22% every major real index.
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:31.040]  I mean, we're being shoveled a bunch of lies. One more caller or try to cram into, I don't know.
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:40.240]  Let's talk to John in Michigan. Go ahead, John. Alex, how you doing? Good. I'm good. I'm good.
[3:49:41.360 --> 3:49:44.640]  I guess it's easy to lie to people when you're telling them what they want to hear, huh?
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:48.400]  Yeah. Everything's fine. The government loves you. Drink your mercury.
[3:49:50.080 --> 3:49:53.760]  Never mind. Half your neighbors have cancer and two kids on the block have got their hair
[3:49:53.760 --> 3:49:57.840]  falling out. Your wife's hair is falling out. Everything's fine. What's that? What's that
[3:49:57.840 --> 3:50:04.080]  Nazi quote that the lie can be protected only so long as they're protected, as the people aren't
[3:50:04.080 --> 3:50:07.760]  affected by the consequences? Like the economic, I don't know what I'm saying.
[3:50:07.760 --> 3:50:13.360]  Yeah. Joseph Garbles in 43, as things were collapsing said, we can't lie anymore. We can't
[3:50:13.360 --> 3:50:21.200]  lie as much because if you can't, if you can't block the lie out, it doesn't work anymore.
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:27.120]  And so now the media still is lying, lying, lying, though we're here exposing them and others are.
[3:50:28.000 --> 3:50:32.320]  And all we got to do is put out the truth. The truth is like a virus. It just spreads. You
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:36.400]  don't have to protect it. You don't have to defend it. All you got to do is just put it out there.
[3:50:37.600 --> 3:50:41.360]  And think as this global tyranny rises, the great awakening that's going to happen.
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:44.640]  People are going to not be as materialistic. They're going to get right with their creator.
[3:50:45.920 --> 3:50:51.440]  Think about it. As bad as it's going to get, it's going to serve a purpose. I appreciate your call.
[3:50:52.240 --> 3:50:56.080]  All right, we'll go to Angel because I said I'll hit a few stories we didn't really get to
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:51:01.440]  in the final segment. Stay the course with us and I'll see you today. Five o'clock, two hours from
[3:51:01.440 --> 3:51:06.640]  now. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[3:51:06.640 --> 3:51:10.720]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[3:51:10.720 --> 3:51:15.280]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds have outperformed
[3:51:15.280 --> 3:51:19.440]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[3:51:19.440 --> 3:51:24.720]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[3:51:24.720 --> 3:51:30.640]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[3:51:30.640 --> 3:51:35.200]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in
[3:51:35.200 --> 3:51:40.320]  any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them
[3:51:40.320 --> 3:51:49.600]  today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[3:51:49.600 --> 3:51:58.640]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[3:51:58.640 --> 3:52:05.520]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in
[3:52:05.520 --> 3:52:11.440]  the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this
[3:52:11.440 --> 3:52:16.720]  agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We have determined tremendous
[3:52:16.720 --> 3:52:22.400]  influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's
[3:52:22.400 --> 3:52:28.640]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies
[3:52:28.640 --> 3:52:34.480]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,
[3:52:34.480 --> 3:52:39.280]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists,
[3:52:39.280 --> 3:52:43.360]  they're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:52:43.360 --> 3:52:49.680]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the
[3:52:49.680 --> 3:52:56.960]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right
[3:52:56.960 --> 3:53:05.920]  now in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv. If you owe money to the IRS, you can't make the problem

[3:54:13.200 --> 3:54:18.960]  Department. Don't procrastinate, get in your cars, get down there today. Let these gun grabbers know
[3:54:18.960 --> 3:54:23.840]  we're not putting up with them destroying our rights. And all their lies aren't going to work.
[3:54:23.840 --> 3:54:29.520]  You and climate change expert, there could be more errors in report. And then he goes on to say,
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:33.840]  well, we just said this and claim the Himalayas we're all going to melt because you can go read
[3:54:33.840 --> 3:54:42.640]  the quotes because we still know there's a problem. So he's now admitting the lies, more reports on
[3:54:42.640 --> 3:54:48.080]  thermostats all over the world being given false numbers in a unified fraud by the UN and
[3:54:48.080 --> 3:54:54.080]  major universities working together. See, this was too big. It came out. Also, we've got James
[3:54:54.080 --> 3:54:59.520]  Dillingpool coming on in two days, London Telegraph. UK Parliamentary investigation into
[3:55:00.080 --> 3:55:03.360]  climategate may not be a whitewash. I mean, they're talking about criminal charges.
[3:55:05.360 --> 3:55:10.480]  There's a bunch of other news on that. Investigate Pichari now. All the money he's been making off
[3:55:10.480 --> 3:55:14.880]  climate fraud. It's just, it's just, I meant to get to all this today, but we're going to be
[3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:22.480]  covering it more later in the week. Also, look at this article. This was from ammo land.
[3:55:24.160 --> 3:55:28.960]  And I've seen these other reports. People will take photos of their guns for insurance and get
[3:55:28.960 --> 3:55:34.800]  them developed. And I mean, I guess you shouldn't have your photos developed anywhere. People are
[3:55:34.800 --> 3:55:38.640]  being arrested for showing a five year old daughter in the pool in a bikini. They say,
[3:55:38.640 --> 3:55:45.680]  that's child porn. This guy in Belleville, New Jersey took photos of his guns and email
[3:55:45.680 --> 3:55:50.160]  them to Walgreens to be printed for him. And they called him up and said, these are objectionable.
[3:55:50.160 --> 3:55:55.040]  We won't print them. I mean, just the image of a gun in the hands of a slave will be illegal.
[3:55:55.040 --> 3:55:58.640]  I mean, I got a picture of a gun. There's a picture of a gun right there.
[3:56:02.720 --> 3:56:05.600]  I'm walking down the street. It's an eye station when he puts a picture of a gun in front of my
[3:56:05.600 --> 3:56:13.280]  face. I had like a heart attack. I mean, it's like, and you actually show him a real gun.
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:24.160]  They don't know what to do. Amazing. But I said, I'd take a final call. I mean, folks,
[3:56:24.960 --> 3:56:29.280]  I never even get to the police brutality. The cops are out of control. They'll break people's
[3:56:29.280 --> 3:56:33.200]  arms who aren't even resisting. They'll taser them. They'll beat them up and then they'll charge
[3:56:33.200 --> 3:56:36.880]  them with assaulting them. They'll jump on your legs with their knees and just snap them like
[3:56:36.880 --> 3:56:41.200]  this poor lady we're getting her on. And then they charge you with assaulting them. It's not
[3:56:41.200 --> 3:56:50.160]  enough. You've got a compound fracture. I mean, it's just unbelievable. It's just, hey, don't
[3:56:50.160 --> 3:56:54.480]  worry, cops. You think we're not human. Some of you bad cops. The government doesn't think you're
[3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:58.320]  human either. They're jacking your food and water, but you like it though. It's the system and they
[3:56:58.320 --> 3:57:03.440]  give you uniform and some power and you're going to, you're going to teach you. So yeah,
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:10.400]  you people have no idea what you're part of. Let's talk to Angel in Illinois. Last caller, go ahead.
[3:57:11.360 --> 3:57:18.480]  Hi, just a quick question about GMO foods. Yes. How does the typical person know when they're
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:23.680]  walking into the grocery store, which products are a GMO and which ones aren't? You can't trust
[3:57:23.680 --> 3:57:27.280]  the government certification because three years ago they changed the law where it can be
[3:57:27.280 --> 3:57:33.200]  non-organic, but still say it. But what you really don't want is GMO. Unorganics, not even that bad
[3:57:33.200 --> 3:57:38.560]  because, you know, there's poison out there. You just got to wash it properly. It's the GMO,
[3:57:38.560 --> 3:57:44.480]  the cross species. It's really bad. And you just vote with your dollars and you learn the different
[3:57:44.480 --> 3:57:49.200]  different certifications, what companies you trust, what stickers you trust. And you do research
[3:57:49.200 --> 3:57:53.520]  on it. Your children are worth it. And you just don't buy any big brands of processed stuff. We
[3:57:53.520 --> 3:58:00.000]  all have to consciously realize this is real. This is happening. So they're not going to come out
[3:58:00.000 --> 3:58:05.920]  and put GMO on their products. You won't see it blatantly in front of you. You have to look at
[3:58:06.480 --> 3:58:11.120]  the companies. You have to go with private certifications. And there's a bunch of companies
[3:58:11.120 --> 3:58:17.600]  that do it. And the companies that grow organic, then pay them to come and certify. You'll come
[3:58:17.600 --> 3:58:22.320]  and look at it. And so that's why there's added costs. They have certifiers. They're watching
[3:58:22.320 --> 3:58:25.920]  what's done. We have to do this because these evil globalists are poisoning everything. You
[3:58:25.920 --> 3:58:31.200]  understand? Don't drink fluoridated water. Don't eat at fast food restaurants. Start there.
[3:58:31.760 --> 3:58:38.160]  And don't eat the GMO corn. That is the particularly deadly chemical weapon. I'll see you downtown
[3:58:38.160 --> 3:58:45.680]  five o'clock, two hours from now. Call everybody. Be there. Second amendment demonstration. Second
[3:58:45.680 --> 3:58:53.520]  amendment demonstration. Five o'clock. Be there. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you
[3:58:53.520 --> 3:58:58.560]  should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[3:58:58.560 --> 3:59:03.840]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power
[3:59:03.840 --> 3:59:08.800]  your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[3:59:08.800 --> 3:59:13.760]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[3:59:13.760 --> 3:59:19.280]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[3:59:19.280 --> 3:59:24.080]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year,
[3:59:24.080 --> 3:59:28.720]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[3:59:28.720 --> 3:59:33.120]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the
[3:59:33.120 --> 3:59:37.600]  solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get
