[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:11.000 --> 00:20.000]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time.
[00:20.000 --> 00:27.000]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down, sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  Go tell that long-tongue liar, go and tell that midnight writer.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter, tell the McGots.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's September 16th, 2019 on this Monday Global Broadcast.
[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:45.000 --> 00:53.000]  The world is on the edge of a major regional conflict that will definitely cause a major financial crisis
[00:53.000 --> 01:00.000]  and probably a recession slash depression if it goes to escalated military conflict.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  We can easily lead to a larger war and a new world war.
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  We're in one of the most dangerous periods in world history and you see all the proxy armies moving into place
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  with India and China and Pakistan.
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  You see the Italian nationalist overthrown and the borders opened again to the Middle East and North Africa
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  and the UN invasion accelerating. You see nation states under attack across the world.
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  You see the left trying to implode our borders and announcing they're coming for our guns.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  It's because they know they're getting ready to trigger not just civil wars in the United States but across the planet.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  The new world order is about to make its move and right after Bolton leaves office one week ago
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  as the National Security Advisor, the big hawk, Netanyahu is facing a snap election here in just a few days.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  All of this is unfolding right now. Russia is having a special election.
[01:53.000 --> 02:01.000]  As all of this happens, boom, drones of reportedly Iranian manufacturer, their proxy army out of Yemen
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  is taking responsibility, blows up half of the Saudi oil production,
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.000]  one of the biggest attacks in history on an oil facility, probably the biggest,
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  even bigger than Saddam blowing up his own oil fields, and that is 5% of total world production.
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  This is unprecedented and we've got Trump saying we're locked and loaded.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  We've got the Saudi saying that it's Iran through the proxy Yemeni so we know they're funding.
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.000]  Iran just seized another ship. So Iran is being very provocative and their proxy admits they carried this out.
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  This is insanity. I'd love to say it was a false flag but it doesn't look like it is.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Secretary of State.
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.000]  We're respected all over the world again, respected like we haven't been respected in many, many years.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  You look at Iran and you look at so many of the things that are happening.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  Iran wants to talk, they all want to talk.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  That's President Trump expressing confidence that Iran wants to try to strike a deal with the U.S. on this nuclear program.
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  But you know the president is shrugging off speculation of a potential meeting without preconditions
[03:06.000 --> 03:14.000]  that he could have with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani when both attend the upcoming United Nations General Assembly session here in New York in about two weeks.
[03:14.000 --> 03:22.000]  This all comes up to Tehran last week said it was using advanced centrifuges that are prohibited by the 2050 nuclear deal.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  And of course this all comes amid the breaking news this weekend about those Iranian-backed Houthi rebels attacking Saudi Arabia oil fields.
[03:30.000 --> 03:39.000]  Here comes next retired U.S. Air Force General Robert Spaulding joins us, former senior director for the Strategic Planning at the National Security Council,
[03:39.000 --> 03:48.000]  senior fellow at the Houthi Institute and author of the book Stealth War, How China Took Over While America's Elite Slept.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  General Spaulding, welcome to Fox News Channel.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  Thank you for your service to our great country.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  First let's start with Iran.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  What do you think the chances are that the president could meet with Rouhani when they say,
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  what do we do if you lift all the sanctions?
[04:01.000 --> 04:08.000]  Well I think first of all that's an in going negotiation tactic on the behalf of Iran.
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  And again the reason I wanted to play part of this report was to show you how they're just himming and hawing and then they,
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  oh it's no big deal, you know, have Saudi Arabia's oil fields blown up.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  Will Trump still meet with them next week or in two weeks?
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  Oh we don't know.
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  Oh Pompeo says it's Iran through the rebels in Yemen.
[04:27.000 --> 04:35.000]  So they're just very calmly reporting all this while the rest of the corporate media is promoting that we need to hit Iran right now.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  Senator Paul saying that's insane.
[04:38.000 --> 04:48.000]  And of course this is all perfect timing with Bolton leaving but this is Iran's rebels and they're taking credit.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  And Iran just grabbed another ship so Iran is really really pushing it ladies and gentlemen.
[04:53.000 --> 04:58.000]  We'll look at all the angles and how serious this is.
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.000]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula you are supposed to rename it.
[05:07.000 --> 05:09.000]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.000]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[05:18.000 --> 05:24.000]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps produce healthy blood cells.
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  Essential for proper nervous system functioning goes on and on.
[05:27.000 --> 05:35.000]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.
[05:38.000 --> 05:45.000]  It helps something in full war so it's a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[05:45.000 --> 05:50.000]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[05:50.000 --> 06:16.000]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[06:20.000 --> 06:41.000]  It is September 16th, 2019 on this live Monday edition and the world is in unprecedented crisis right now.
[06:41.000 --> 06:51.000]  I'm going to do my best to walk through this and the different power players are behind the scenes and what's really unfolding and what's really happening.
[06:51.000 --> 07:06.000]  And you're going to get an angle here that you're not going to get anywhere else because we've been tracking this very, very closely and I'm going to lay it out right now.
[07:06.000 --> 07:26.000]  Barack Obama and John Kerry are treasonously and traitorously advising Tehran on how to sabotage what Trump's doing and what Israel's doing and what Saudi Arabia are doing.
[07:26.000 --> 07:45.000]  It's a larger geopolitical system with Obama and Kerry and Hillary as well siding with communist China to shell the United States out in the eight years that they were fully in power.
[07:45.000 --> 07:53.000]  And many of the neocons are also part of the China project to make it dominant in the future and then it goes back to the Clintons in the eight years that they had as well.
[07:53.000 --> 08:00.000]  So if you look at that eight years and eight years is 16 years and then you add another eight years of Obama.
[08:00.000 --> 08:13.000]  That's 24 years that this cabal that all work together and all coordinate through the intelligence agencies and private corporate money to shell the United States out and maneuver us into this.
[08:13.000 --> 08:21.000]  And it really kicked off in earnest under George Herbert Walker Bush who served four years and then maneuvered the Clintons into place.
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  So that's 28 years that they had.
[08:26.000 --> 08:34.000]  Now we've had three years of Trump trying to reverse just the completely treasonous policy and you've seen all hell break loose.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  They maneuvered us where China owned our debt. China owned Hollywood.
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.000]  China had all of our strategic minerals, all the major deep water ports, the Panama Canal, control of the most of the major universities.
[08:46.000 --> 08:52.000]  And the list goes on and on and on from there.
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  Trump gets in, begins to not go along with that.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  The CFR tells us that it's the Chinese century.
[08:59.000 --> 09:00.000]  America is done.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  They bet against us in all the markets.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  Goldman Sachs comes out against us when Trump gets elected, tries to plunge the markets.
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.000]  But Trump's able to call thousands of CEOs, go to Wall Street and just say, hey, let's bet on America.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  Believe in America again, we can do it.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  And despite that, despite all the globalist attacks, the country is back to a great extent.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  So the Federal Reserve raised interest rates eight times and did everything it could to destroy the economy.
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  To again, punish Americans and populists for supporting our own interest.
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.000]  And they admitted that all over CNN, all over MSNBC, all over Bill Maher and HBO.
[09:33.000 --> 09:40.000]  They admit that and they admit they're into pedophilia and they admit they want our guns and they admit they're keeping babies alive.
[09:40.000 --> 09:48.000]  I have San Diego State University promoting pedophilia as a reasonable sexual preference.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  Articles on infowars.com.
[09:50.000 --> 10:00.000]  Right now, San Diego State University normalizes pedophilia as a sexual orientation.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  Isn't that interesting?
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  And people said, oh, it's not real.
[10:04.000 --> 10:15.000]  So I went into the man's Twitter, who's there at San Diego, found the classes, found the classes in and found the online study sheet for that very class saying pedophilia is normal.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  See, people can't believe this because it's the total normalization of all this coming out in the open.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  But let me get back to where we're at.
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  Half of Saudi Arabia's oil production destroyed by drones that hit two different oil fields, two of the biggest in the world.
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.000]  5% of total global oil production killed. That's all the surplus that we have.
[10:36.000 --> 10:46.000]  Trump is right to say to markets it's okay because the US is now the global net biggest exporter and we can crank up production anytime we want to.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  Most of the wells are metered.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  Most of the wells have been turned off.
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  There's such a glut of oil.
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  We were taught that there's peak oil and it's all running out because the globalists wanted to have a post-industrial world.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  The Saudis funded the peak oil movement and they funded movements to kill drilling in the US and Canada.
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  That's all record with the left showed that we wouldn't have this glut.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  But we have the glut.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  We have a lot of extra.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  But still, if Saudi Arabia gets totally turned off, Europe and China will go into a depression.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  And they are the ones in a trade war with the United States.
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  And so isn't that just too bad?
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  We have to look at all those different angles but we know rebels in a civil war in Yemen that Saudi Arabia has been carrying out for what, five years?
[11:30.000 --> 11:36.000]  Have already attacked Riyadh with cruise missiles and ICBMs and we know they've taken credit.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  We know Iran is giving them the technology.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  We know Iran is seizing ships almost every day.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  They just grabbed another one out of the Strait of Hormuz.
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  Ships are turning the transponders off just to get through even though they're not on the Iranian side.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  The Iranians are engaging in terroristic piracy.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  They're completely out of control.
[11:54.000 --> 12:03.000]  Because the regime is on the verge of collapsing because of Western sanctions and they're very unpopular with their population, half of which is under the age of 30.
[12:03.000 --> 12:10.000]  The Ayatollahs and their monotheistic Shiite system of the Islamic State, or the original one, is in deep trouble.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  And so they're in a crisis and they are escalating.
[12:13.000 --> 12:21.000]  And they are behind these attacks because their rebels have officially taken credit for this.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  You know, people are saying, why is M4 war saying this is real?
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  And why is Dredge Report saying it's real?
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  Because they've taken responsibility in Yemen and these are high-tech cruise missiles that did this.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  Now, is there a deep state in Iran?
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  Could this have been done by another group to try to have the U.S. strike the Mullahs to kick them out?
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  What do you have so loosely?
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  Are there different factions in Iran?
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  You bet your bottom dollar it is.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  And so I don't want a war.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  I don't want this to escalate.
[12:53.000 --> 13:03.000]  But let me tell you, when two of the biggest oil fields in the world, number one and number two get blown up and destroyed and are on fire as we speak,
[13:03.000 --> 13:14.000]  they're going to throw some b-roll of them burning at night like an image out of Dante's Inferno, then you know we are in a very, very serious precarious position.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  Because Iran has sleeper cells all over the world.
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  We're going to talk more about that when we come back from break.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  But let me make the big announcement now and then I'll flesh it out after a break.
[13:23.000 --> 13:31.000]  Remember in the last three years that everywhere Trump goes, Obama and former Secretary of State carry following them around and do, quote,
[13:31.000 --> 13:42.000]  a diplomacy and they've been advising Iran how to embarrass Trump and they've been sabotaging his peace deals with North Korea through the neocons that they work with, like Bolton.
[13:42.000 --> 13:53.000]  And so they've even told Iran, I said this last year, hey, go ahead and hijack ships, go ahead and escalate, push Trump into a crisis.
[13:53.000 --> 14:01.000]  And just like Kennedy got set up to carry out the Bay of Pigs and then the CIA botched it on purpose, they're maneuvering Trump into that right now, you better believe it.
[14:01.000 --> 14:17.000]  It'll hurt the economy, it'll hurt the recovery and they will sabotage our military, the deep state will, and this will go off like a horrible fiasco just like they set up the Delta Force going in in 1979 trying to rescue the hostages in Tehran.
[14:17.000 --> 14:26.000]  It was a setup from the beginning, so you better believe the deep state here and the deep state in Iran are working together on this and this is not a good idea for Trump to strike.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  There's another way to do it.
[14:28.000 --> 14:46.000]  U.S. Special Forces can go in after all of the Yemenis rebel sites are hit, missile sites are hit and then send in hit teams, surf teams to go in and wipe out the rebels in Yemen and wipe out the Iranians and push them out like we've just done in Syria.
[14:46.000 --> 14:52.000]  You've got to kick out the Saudi backed ISIS folks who Saudi stopped supporting when Trump got elected.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  And we've got to have Iran get out of there as well.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  The Russians pulled out as agreed.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  The Russians came in and did most of the work for us, 90% of it, they then pulled out as agreed.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  Iran did not pull out as agreed.
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  So kick their ass out of Syria and kick their ass out of Yemen and then no one can say that we're putting up with their crap.
[15:10.000 --> 15:16.000]  That's the limited, controlled, real response. The missiles came out of Yemen.
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  They've been going on five years in civil war, go in there and destroy them.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  The Saudi Arabians are incompetent.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  They literally give like a million dollars a sortie to the pilots.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  They give them brand new Rolls Royce's when they do call them heroes.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  They're flying around at 50,000 feet, dropping bombs.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  Can't hit their ass in the dark.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  And we just have to go in and in the civil war.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  And clean it up or it's just going to keep happening.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  But we don't want a full scale war with Iran.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  But Iran just keeps pushing and pushing.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  But let me explain the key when we come back.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  Explain the key.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  I just said it, don't you?
[15:52.000 --> 16:21.000]  The globalists are working to sabotage Trump and America right now.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:53.000 --> 16:59.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system,
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.000]  There are a few things in this universe that are a sure bet,
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  but I'm here to tell you the products that in FullWarsLive.com are.
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.000]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested,
[18:09.000 --> 18:15.000]  most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature,
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation,
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  It sells itself.
[18:28.000 --> 18:36.000]  But normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  Originally obviously from India.
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.000]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it,
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  and that's why people absolutely love it.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[18:53.000 --> 19:22.000]  50% off on bodies at FullWarsLive.com.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  First, they give you just a few basic things to do.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  Don't support Trump. Don't promote Alex Jones.
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  And once you've submitted to that, well, don't say mother and father,
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  and well, let us sterilize your children.
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  Take these forced inoculations, and here, take this Prozac pill,
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  and here, smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  Oh, don't be a Christian.
[19:42.000 --> 19:47.000]  This is truly the market to be system, and we're on air right now covering it,
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  and you're awake, you're involved, you're engaged, you're an ambassador of truth,
[19:50.000 --> 19:54.000]  so I'm begging you for yourself and myself, my family, and your family,
[19:54.000 --> 20:20.000]  and spread the word about it FullWars.com, the live shows right now.
[20:24.000 --> 20:39.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are absolutely loaded for bear today.
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. Thank you for joining us.
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.000]  We are here despite the leftist and neo-conestablishment,
[20:45.000 --> 20:51.000]  the stay-behind networks at the CIA, the corrupt units inside the Justice Department,
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  major Democratic Party law firms, and others, openly trying to shut us down,
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  openly trying to silence us, openly trying to start a major war
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  to derail our economy and derail President Trump as well.
[21:05.000 --> 21:11.000]  Now, next segment, I'm going to really walk through every sector and every piece
[21:11.000 --> 21:19.000]  of how big this is with Saudi Arabia and its major oil fields blown up,
[21:19.000 --> 21:27.000]  both of its production by drones produced by Iran launched by their proxy network
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  of Hezbollah forces that lead the five-year civil war in Yemen.
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.000]  This is part of a Shiite-Sunni civil war for global control over the cancer
[21:37.000 --> 21:42.000]  that is expansive, revolutionary Islam.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  So we're going to be looking at every facet of this today
[21:47.000 --> 21:53.000]  and the fact that Obama and Secretary of State, the former Secretary of State,
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.000]  John Kerry, are admittedly, if you go back a few years and then even currently,
[21:57.000 --> 22:04.000]  advising Iran on how to maneuver Trump into a very destructive position.
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  And the EU, the Chai comms, and the leftist in our government,
[22:09.000 --> 22:15.000]  along with the neo-cons, are playing a very sophisticated double game.
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.000]  It was the neo-cons back in the late 70s that maneuvered that whole crisis
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  and the hostage situation and the Iran contra.
[22:24.000 --> 22:32.000]  But this is a nest of globalists inside the conservative movement derailing it by design.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  That is all coming up next segment. I'm going to lay it all out.
[22:36.000 --> 22:41.000]  But first, let me tell you something about what's unfolding live on the ground.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  I want to do a document cam shot, please, for TV viewers, for radio listeners.
[22:45.000 --> 22:51.000]  A few years ago, in April of 2017,
[22:51.000 --> 22:55.000]  Mike Cernovich received secret documents from inside Google
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  to Google then the next day after this article came out and said,
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  no, that these are real. We paid a firm millions of dollars
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  to delist Alex Jones at infowars.com from search engines
[23:07.000 --> 23:13.000]  by having bought farms, go out and downvote infowars
[23:13.000 --> 23:20.000]  and say that it's not credible and to call for it to be removed off platforms.
[23:20.000 --> 23:25.000]  Okay? That's how they took our stories from being at the top of searches to the bottom.
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  That's only one part of the attacks. You can see the documents here in the article.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  Google admitted it was real.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  Now, the company, which is really getting a CIA contract from where Obama put $2 million in
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  when he left office into the future defense budget of 2017 and 18
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  to counter foreign disinformation and quote propaganda act.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  And this is through that contract through Google. It's all right here. It's they say, go read it.
[23:50.000 --> 23:56.000]  We had to do this because Alex Jones had Ron Paul on
[23:56.000 --> 24:01.000]  and Ron Paul said that the UN report said the chemical attack was really carried out in Syria
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  by Al Nuzra and ISIS.
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  And then that got picked up by Fox News and Ron Paul.
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  And then we were unable to invade Syria.
[24:10.000 --> 24:15.000]  They actually go read the articles and it's got the document they send out
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  to thousands of operatives running millions of bots.
[24:19.000 --> 24:23.000]  And then the government gives the money to Google and then gives it back to the agencies.
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.000]  But again, 90% of it's private now.
[24:26.000 --> 24:34.000]  And so the CIA says in this document that Alex Jones has to be delisted
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  because he said that the chemical attacks were staged to get us into a wider war,
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  which later came out was true. It was true then.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  See, they failed, ladies and gentlemen, miserably to do that.
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  This morning, as soon as my position came out on the David Night Show,
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  when I came on David Night Show at 8, 8.15 in the morning,
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  and I said John Kerry and Obama are part of shadow diplomacy.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  It's illegal. They follow Trump around.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  They've told Iran what to do, how to grab ships, how to resist.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  That even came out two years ago.
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.000]  This is treason. They're working with the Chai comms on how to defeat us.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  They're betting against America.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  Lloyd Blankflying Bragg, they were betting against America two years ago.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  We've got to make this the big issue.
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  They expose that we have deep state working with Iran to maneuver us into a war
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  that will kill the economy.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  Within five minutes of my policy coming out, my idea,
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  we were hit with giant denial of service attacks,
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  very sophisticated knowing exactly where to hit,
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  even though we're behind the biggest server group in the world.
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.000]  I won't say their names, but everybody uses it.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  Then as soon as I went on air at 11 a.m. Central,
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  they hit again to bring down infowarstore.com.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  They're also hitting infowars.com.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  So understand that I am here on air trying to simply point out,
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  and you can type this into a search engine, Obama and Kerry.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  Trump tells Obama and Kerry to stop advising Iran against the U.S.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  Just type that in.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  It started two and a half years ago, two years ago.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.000]  It's been a huge scandal.
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  I'm just reminding everybody who's advising Iran,
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.000]  who's got cruise missiles blowing up half of Saudi Arabia's oil production.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  Don't come back after breaking those articles for it.
[26:21.000 --> 26:26.000]  But this is what is so amazing about all this,
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  and this is where we stand as a society and a culture,
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  and they have congressional hearings every month
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  in the Intelligence Committee and everywhere else,
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.000]  saying shut Alex Jones up, shut Paul Watson up, shut Matt Rudge up.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  Yeah, they found a zero-edge article.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  Let's put that up.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  Great job finding that.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  Former Obama officials caught advising Iran
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  on how to defeat Trump's foreign policy report.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  And then it goes through it, but that was also in AP Reuters.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  And the media's like, good.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  You know, they're like, China helped defeat Trump.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  Washington Post three weeks ago.
[26:59.000 --> 27:02.000]  Oh, gee, crush Trump and on trade.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  Teach us, crush us.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  Actually said crush Trump, teach us, save him.
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  I mean, how sick?
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.000]  Like asking Hitler in 1943 to crush Roosevelt or Eisenhower.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  But that's how much the America hating has gotten institutionalized
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  and normalized.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  So I'm here on air, just a loyal American, care about peace,
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  care about justice.
[27:23.000 --> 27:24.000]  Somebody really attacks us.
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  I say get them.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  But we're being lured into this.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  Iran's very bold, grabbing ships, very bold.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  They're doing all this.
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  They're doing it all.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  My own listeners are like, no, you're covering up.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  It's a false flag.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  I'm the guy that popularized false flags.
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  20 years ago, people didn't know what that meant.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  This is real.
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.000]  But the false flag is that the globalists are working with Iran,
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  setting Trump and America up to kill the economy,
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  get us into a war and then sabotage our military.
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  I'm going to get more into this after the break, but this is it.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  So as we speak, the shopping cart's up, works great.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  All certificates.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  They're just trying to shut down having service.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  Telling me, hey, buddy, we're suing you.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  We're having Defense Department meetings about you.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  You stay out of this war.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  The Democrats and the neocons are right now telling me,
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  hey, we've taken your bank accounts.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  We've taken all your sponsors.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  You know, you're down to your shopping cart.
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  Well, okay.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  I mean, what next?
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  Are you going to kill me?
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  I don't want to die, but just do whatever you have to scumbags.
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  I don't want to have World War 4.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  I don't want to have Obama and Kerry over there advising
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  how to sucker us into a new Bay of Pigs times 100, times 1,000.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  But listeners, we need your support.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  This is a real war.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  We've got a bunch of items.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  Like SuperMilitality, 50% off with a free bottle of ultimate

[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  Free bottle of SuperMilitality.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  They're both great products, but I want you to experience it
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  and get hooked on it.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  And we've got Brainforce, 40% off.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  And Chillforce, 40% off.

[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  We need your financial support.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  Please take action.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure,
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  But the symptoms are there.
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops.
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  Poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference
[29:17.000 --> 29:20.000]  in thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look,
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  should be using this product as a preventative
[29:36.000 --> 29:58.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[29:58.000 --> 30:04.000]  Super Silver Woon Shell is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[30:04.000 --> 30:07.000]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  and approved for that by the FDA.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[30:12.000 --> 30:14.000]  The last two years has been a bestseller.
[30:14.000 --> 30:17.000]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream
[30:17.000 --> 30:21.000]  that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.000]  at a lower price with their patented SilverSol technology in it.
[30:25.000 --> 30:27.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid.
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  It's got the steric acid.
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil.

[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  and in the smaller one.
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price,
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  and it funds the InfoWare at InfoWarsLife.com.
[30:48.000 --> 30:51.000]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[30:51.000 --> 30:54.000]  We can only run this special for another week or so
[30:54.000 --> 30:57.000]  as I'm taping this September 10th.
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  I know most of you realize this,
[30:59.000 --> 31:02.000]  but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  You are just as important as I am
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  or the rest of the crew at InfoWars,
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.000]  and we are the individuals that have done the research
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.000]  to understand the Globalist Battle Plan,
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.000]  and we know how to take them down.
[31:13.000 --> 31:14.000]  That's why they're so upset.
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  Think how far we've come together.
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  Even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  because it's the right thing to do
[31:21.000 --> 31:24.000]  against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  who've really taken the mask off.
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience
[31:37.000 --> 31:40.000]  because you are truly activists in the arena.
[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth

[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  this operation that you built,
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  that your operation would not be here.
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  We've got some giant specials running right now

[32:56.200 --> 33:22.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.200 --> 33:40.200]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:40.200 --> 34:04.200]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[34:04.200 --> 34:31.200]  You know, we've got this huge news in the world really moving quickly towards
[34:31.200 --> 34:36.200]  global war, all the armies are lining up in the usual ways before we have a world war.
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.200]  And you've got evil just coming out of the woodwork right now making its move.
[34:40.200 --> 34:47.200]  You can see the spiritual battle very, very clear with defined edges now on this planet.
[34:47.200 --> 34:52.200]  And we're going to go over all of it here today.
[34:52.200 --> 34:58.200]  U.S. prepares to strike Iran as the Middle East braces for a major world war that could erupt.
[34:58.200 --> 35:02.200]  It's Michael Snyder's analysis at enforce dot com and news wars dot com.
[35:02.200 --> 35:04.200]  And, you know, I really agree with that statement.
[35:04.200 --> 35:07.200]  And you tune into mainstream news or not even making a big deal about it.
[35:07.200 --> 35:08.200]  That's why you know it's so serious.
[35:08.200 --> 35:18.200]  Oil to hit 100 Pompeo blames Iran for unprecedented drone attack that crippled largest Saudi oil processing facility.
[35:18.200 --> 35:20.200]  Rand Paul warns against needless escalation of war.
[35:20.200 --> 35:24.200]  We're going to get to that.
[35:24.200 --> 35:29.200]  But I'm going to cover all that actually next segment because I'm putting some more of the articles I thought I'd want to show you.
[35:29.200 --> 35:30.200]  So I'll just tell you about it.
[35:30.200 --> 35:43.200]  So you remember when former Secretary of State and John Kerry and Obama are traveling around the world advising Iran how to embarrass
[35:43.200 --> 35:46.200]  Trump and how to militarily grab ships.
[35:46.200 --> 35:48.200]  I remember they advised we're putting those articles for you.
[35:48.200 --> 35:50.200]  They're all linked right here.
[35:50.200 --> 35:54.200]  They advised them how to grab ships or shut the Strait of Hormuz.
[35:54.200 --> 35:55.200]  Remember that?
[35:55.200 --> 35:56.200]  And it was like, wow, that's treason.
[35:56.200 --> 35:58.200]  You know, the news even talked about it a couple of years ago.
[35:58.200 --> 36:01.200]  Well, you're seeing that right now.
[36:01.200 --> 36:08.200]  And that's Obama and all these globalists betting against America.
[36:08.200 --> 36:10.200]  Betting against us with China and everybody else.
[36:10.200 --> 36:19.200]  And even though it's against their own self interest, the average leftist spray paints on the sides of the highways that Antifa will
[36:19.200 --> 36:24.200]  crush the right and we salute China.
[36:24.200 --> 36:31.200]  And then I have crew members who have liberal family members, multiple ones, said, oh, yeah, my sister said they love
[36:31.200 --> 36:37.200]  Communist China and hope they hope they smash Trump and it's on the cover of the Washington Post.
[36:37.200 --> 36:42.200]  I mean, what more do we need to even know about the situation?
[36:42.200 --> 36:45.200]  But hell, we've killed 60 million babies.
[36:45.200 --> 36:47.200]  Of course they kill babies after they're born now.
[36:47.200 --> 36:51.200]  Of course we kill old people who are begging for their lives now and euthanize them.
[36:51.200 --> 36:53.200]  It's not just right to die.
[36:53.200 --> 36:59.200]  It's the right for the state to kill you because we didn't have any bottom.
[36:59.200 --> 37:02.200]  We didn't have any point to which we wouldn't sink.
[37:02.200 --> 37:07.200]  But, you know, after I get to some of this gun control knows, we'll get more into it next hour.
[37:07.200 --> 37:13.200]  And Gavin McGinnis is joining us in the third hour.
[37:13.200 --> 37:17.200]  I want to get into the Kavanaugh thing.
[37:17.200 --> 37:22.200]  And I actually had a big stack of it here in my stacks as part of my frustration.
[37:22.200 --> 37:26.200]  I have so many articles that was just digging around during the break trying to find the stack.
[37:26.200 --> 37:28.200]  So I guess we're going to reprint it all.
[37:28.200 --> 37:31.200]  But this latest Kavanaugh thing is so big.
[37:31.200 --> 37:36.200]  I wanted to read you the quotes, not just repeat what was there.
[37:36.200 --> 37:46.200]  Because as soon as I saw them last week say, oh, we need to impeach Kavanaugh,
[37:46.200 --> 37:51.200]  I knew it was pure bull because the other six were four of them that admitted they lied,
[37:51.200 --> 37:52.200]  but said it's okay.
[37:52.200 --> 37:54.200]  I mean, he's a bad guy lying to get a bad guy's okay.
[37:54.200 --> 37:55.200]  He justifies the means.
[37:55.200 --> 37:57.200]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[37:57.200 --> 38:02.200]  You define whoever's bad and you become the bad guy to get them.
[38:02.200 --> 38:06.200]  And Beto said they're going to impeach him all the rest of it.
[38:06.200 --> 38:16.200]  And then it came out that the woman who they quote is saying he pulled his ding dong out on said it never happened.
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.200]  They just quoted some woman and said there were witnesses that he did it to her.
[38:20.200 --> 38:22.200]  And none of it was true.
[38:22.200 --> 38:23.200]  They called her.
[38:23.200 --> 38:24.200]  She said that never happened.
[38:24.200 --> 38:25.200]  I don't remember that.
[38:25.200 --> 38:26.200]  I don't remember.
[38:26.200 --> 38:31.200]  They even know Kavanaugh.
[38:31.200 --> 38:34.200]  But the New York Times didn't care.
[38:34.200 --> 38:39.200]  They ran with it.
[38:39.200 --> 38:47.200]  And that was just like when NPR calls up and said, did you drink the ink out of pens and threatened to rape a woman?
[38:47.200 --> 38:48.200]  I was like, what?
[38:48.200 --> 38:49.200]  No.
[38:49.200 --> 38:51.200]  I'm a famous person.
[38:51.200 --> 38:52.200]  I'm hated.
[38:52.200 --> 38:58.200]  You can find anybody to just make up something that I drink ink out of pens.
[38:58.200 --> 38:59.200]  I was like, are you joking?
[38:59.200 --> 39:06.200]  Yeah, and you beat up all these nerds so you got tied up in the woods in a cabin and all your teeth knocked out.
[39:06.200 --> 39:07.200]  And I said, well, that's not true.
[39:07.200 --> 39:10.200]  I said, I'll go to a dentist.
[39:10.200 --> 39:13.200]  A dentist can tell you if any of my teeth ever been knocked out, none have ever been knocked out.
[39:13.200 --> 39:15.200]  Well, yeah, we want you to do that.
[39:15.200 --> 39:17.200]  And a few days later they go, no, we're going to pass.
[39:17.200 --> 39:20.200]  But they went on air and said all my teeth were knocked out.
[39:20.200 --> 39:24.200]  And again, they know they're lying.
[39:24.200 --> 39:28.200]  And when you come to grips with that, like AP, saying,
[39:28.200 --> 39:32.200]  I wrote a book about Sandy Hook and that I lost a lawsuit.
[39:32.200 --> 39:33.200]  I never wrote a book.
[39:33.200 --> 39:34.200]  I didn't lose a lawsuit.
[39:34.200 --> 39:41.200]  And I had lawyers send letters to AP and market watch Wall Street Journal owns that Fox News Corp.
[39:41.200 --> 39:44.200]  And they just said, we're going with it.
[39:44.200 --> 39:46.200]  Suez, we have unlimited money.
[39:46.200 --> 39:53.200]  We don't care.
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.200]  Because remember, Jesse Ventura, love him or hate him.
[39:56.200 --> 40:01.200]  He got a jury to find that he didn't say Navy SEALs deserve to die.
[40:01.200 --> 40:04.200]  Obviously, he didn't do that inside a Navy SEAL bar.
[40:04.200 --> 40:06.200]  And Chris Kyle didn't knock him out.
[40:06.200 --> 40:08.200]  It's not a true story.
[40:08.200 --> 40:13.200]  He won that defamation, but the appeals court overturned it.
[40:13.200 --> 40:16.200]  So big media thinks it can just lie.
[40:16.200 --> 40:25.200]  But now with my cases, they want to get rid of New York Times versus Sullivan,
[40:25.200 --> 40:28.200]  which will get rid of the protections.
[40:28.200 --> 40:32.200]  So now the big law firms are saying, oh, we want to settle these cases with you.
[40:32.200 --> 40:35.200]  Can't get blood out of a turnip, dumbasses.
[40:35.200 --> 40:36.200]  Settle.
[40:36.200 --> 40:38.200]  There ain't no money, you dumb jerks.
[40:38.200 --> 40:40.200]  Oh, how about you just support gun control?
[40:40.200 --> 40:42.200]  How about you piss up a rope?
[40:42.200 --> 40:46.200]  That'll be even better.
[40:46.200 --> 40:49.200]  I've had people try to destroy my life, threaten to kill me, try to kill me.
[40:49.200 --> 40:52.200]  You think money is a motivator for me?
[40:52.200 --> 40:56.200]  Piss up a rope.
[40:56.200 --> 40:58.200]  I didn't sell out to Hollywood.
[40:58.200 --> 41:00.200]  I didn't sell out to the big radio networks.
[41:00.200 --> 41:02.200]  I never sold out.
[41:02.200 --> 41:07.200]  But then it means I've got to fight to have money to do it my way and tell the truth.
[41:07.200 --> 41:10.200]  We'll come back and get into the Cabinol thing, play the clips, want all of it.
[41:10.200 --> 41:12.200]  It's incredible.
[41:12.200 --> 41:14.200]  But first off, I'll just go back to this.
[41:14.200 --> 41:16.200]  I sell things you really need.
[41:16.200 --> 41:20.200]  Everybody needs a gravity-fed filter for the best systems to keep the good minerals in,
[41:20.200 --> 41:24.200]  but cut out all the hundreds of bad things like glyphosates,
[41:24.200 --> 41:26.200]  to give you that prostate and breast cancer,
[41:26.200 --> 41:28.200]  and all the other garbage.
[41:28.200 --> 41:30.200]  I mean, why you wouldn't do it for your kids?
[41:30.200 --> 41:32.200]  I don't know.
[41:32.200 --> 41:34.200]  They're both excellent.
[41:34.200 --> 41:36.200]  They're both apples and oranges.
[41:36.200 --> 41:38.200]  One's better at this, one's better at that.
[41:38.200 --> 41:40.200]  It's all 9, 9, 9, 9, 9%, reduced, or completely reduced, hundreds of chemicals.
[41:40.200 --> 41:42.200]  I saw this Yahoo article.
[41:42.200 --> 41:44.200]  Women are all getting cancer off the charts because of toxic makeup.
[41:44.200 --> 41:46.200]  Yeah, right.
[41:46.200 --> 41:48.200]  Yeah, sure.
[41:48.200 --> 41:50.200]  All the cancer viruses, sweetheart,
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.200]  and all the jet-streamed pollution from China,
[41:54.200 --> 41:57.200]  and the GMO, and the glyphosate, and all the water.
[41:57.200 --> 42:00.200]  Filter your water or die.
[42:00.200 --> 42:02.200]  And then, yeah, I'm selling you filters, exactly.
[42:02.200 --> 42:04.200]  People test them and they go, wow, they're the best out there.
[42:04.200 --> 42:06.200]  Well, he sells the best at a good price.
[42:06.200 --> 42:09.200]  Wow, why does he do that? Well, that's what I do.
[42:09.200 --> 42:11.200]  Alexa, pure breeze.
[42:11.200 --> 42:13.200]  We make like 50 bucks on these.

[44:03.200 --> 44:05.200]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter
[44:05.200 --> 44:07.200]  and approved for that by the FDA.
[44:07.200 --> 44:09.200]  We have been blessed with their listeners
[44:09.200 --> 44:11.200]  and let us private label it in the last two years.
[44:11.200 --> 44:13.200]  It's been a best seller.
[44:13.200 --> 44:15.200]  We convinced them to let us
[44:15.200 --> 44:17.200]  come out with a skin cream
[44:17.200 --> 44:19.200]  that basically mimics the top skin creams
[44:19.200 --> 44:21.200]  that are already out there
[44:21.200 --> 44:23.200]  at a lower price with their patented
[44:23.200 --> 44:25.200]  SilverSol technology in it.
[44:25.200 --> 44:27.200]  It's got the hyaluronic acid.
[44:27.200 --> 44:29.200]  It's got the steric acid.
[44:29.200 --> 44:31.200]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil.
[44:31.200 --> 44:33.200]  It's got the nano silver coconut oil
[44:33.200 --> 44:35.200]  and so much more.
[44:35.200 --> 44:37.200]  It's in two sizes. Super silver skin cream
[44:37.200 --> 44:39.200]  in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[44:39.200 --> 44:41.200]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[44:41.200 --> 44:43.200]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[44:43.200 --> 44:45.200]  And it funds the Infowar
[44:45.200 --> 44:47.200]  at infowarslife.com.
[44:47.200 --> 44:49.200]  Get your super silver
[44:49.200 --> 44:51.200]  skin cream today.
[44:51.200 --> 44:53.200]  We can only run this special for another week or so
[44:53.200 --> 44:55.200]  as of taping this September 10th.
[44:59.200 --> 45:01.200]  We have entered a great time of change.
[45:01.200 --> 45:03.200]  The social engineers
[45:03.200 --> 45:05.200]  who serve Satan
[45:05.200 --> 45:07.200]  who are in control of this planet
[45:07.200 --> 45:09.200]  believe that if they can organize
[45:09.200 --> 45:11.200]  enough crises that they control
[45:11.200 --> 45:13.200]  they can terrorize the
[45:13.200 --> 45:15.200]  planet into accepting a tyrannical
[45:15.200 --> 45:17.200]  corporate world government
[45:17.200 --> 45:19.200]  known as a technocracy in their own words
[45:19.200 --> 45:21.200]  that will manage and control
[45:21.200 --> 45:23.200]  and manipulate every facet of our lives.
[45:23.200 --> 45:25.200]  At first,
[45:25.200 --> 45:27.200]  they can do just a few basic things to do.
[45:27.200 --> 45:29.200]  Don't support Trump. Don't promote Alex Jones.
[45:29.200 --> 45:31.200]  And once you've submitted to that
[45:31.200 --> 45:33.200]  well don't say mother and father
[45:33.200 --> 45:35.200]  and well let us sterilize your children.
[45:35.200 --> 45:37.200]  Take these forced inoculations
[45:37.200 --> 45:39.200]  and here take this Prozac pill
[45:39.200 --> 45:41.200]  and here smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[45:41.200 --> 45:43.200]  Don't be a Christian.
[45:43.200 --> 45:45.200]  This is truly the market of the beat system
[45:45.200 --> 45:47.200]  and we're on air right now covering it
[45:47.200 --> 45:49.200]  and you're awake. You're involved. You're engaged.
[45:49.200 --> 45:51.200]  You're an ambassador of truth.
[45:51.200 --> 45:53.200]  So I'm begging you for yourself and myself
[45:53.200 --> 45:55.200]  and my family and your family.
[45:55.200 --> 46:17.200]  We have never been closer to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East with the Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their capacity. 5% of world capacity. Whoever's behind it know this there are powerful forces that want a global conflagration.
[46:17.200 --> 46:25.200]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position is here on this planet.
[46:25.200 --> 46:29.200]  And that we are just mortal flawed human beings
[46:29.200 --> 46:33.200]  that need to seek God's countenance, God's discernment
[46:33.200 --> 46:35.200]  and to pray for peace
[46:35.200 --> 46:37.200]  and to pray for transparency
[46:37.200 --> 46:40.200]  and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet
[46:40.200 --> 46:42.200]  trying to start a world war
[46:42.200 --> 46:44.200]  will be exposed in their attempts
[46:44.200 --> 46:47.200]  and creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped.
[46:47.200 --> 46:49.200]  Now we'll probably avert a new world war hopefully
[46:49.200 --> 46:53.200]  but it's already tilting towards a global depression
[46:53.200 --> 46:55.200]  because of energy crisis.
[46:55.200 --> 47:16.200]  We're covering it all live on the radio at 4.com.
[47:25.200 --> 47:38.200]  I want listeners to understand something.
[47:38.200 --> 47:40.200]  I came into work this morning
[47:40.200 --> 47:45.200]  and they explained to me when the denial of service attack hit in 4.com
[47:45.200 --> 47:47.200]  and the main sites
[47:47.200 --> 47:49.200]  and exactly how they were doing it
[47:49.200 --> 47:52.200]  and I understood it was five minutes after I came out and said Obama
[47:52.200 --> 47:56.200]  and John Carrier advising Iran on how to hijack these ships
[47:56.200 --> 47:58.200]  how to begin to take control of the trade of Hormuz
[47:58.200 --> 48:00.200]  to damage the U.S. economy
[48:00.200 --> 48:02.200]  in a proxy war with the United States
[48:02.200 --> 48:04.200]  via Iran who they're allied with
[48:04.200 --> 48:06.200]  and they admitted they were doing that a few years ago
[48:06.200 --> 48:09.200]  I have a stack of news
[48:09.200 --> 48:14.200]  that I will get to next hour on that subject
[48:14.200 --> 48:17.200]  when they were admitting this two years ago and a year ago
[48:17.200 --> 48:21.200]  and of course the leftists still embedded inside the CIA want me off air
[48:21.200 --> 48:23.200]  I'm telling Trump how they're embedded
[48:23.200 --> 48:24.200]  how they're operating
[48:24.200 --> 48:27.200]  I'm showing people documents that Mike Cernovich got
[48:27.200 --> 48:29.200]  you know he got the Epstein documents too
[48:29.200 --> 48:31.200]  he's a good guy
[48:31.200 --> 48:35.200]  where they say we Alex Jones echoes Ron Paul
[48:35.200 --> 48:37.200]  who put out Russian propaganda
[48:37.200 --> 48:39.200]  that the chemical attacks were staged
[48:39.200 --> 48:43.200]  you know the UN our own government had said it by then
[48:43.200 --> 48:48.200]  and they said we cannot allow him with future conflicts to have a voice
[48:48.200 --> 48:51.200]  that's why they're taking us off the air go read it
[48:51.200 --> 48:53.200]  in that article we have the scans
[48:53.200 --> 48:57.200]  of what they sent out to the thousands of people
[48:57.200 --> 48:59.200]  in private corporate intelligence
[48:59.200 --> 49:02.200]  again over 80% of intelligence is now private
[49:02.200 --> 49:05.200]  Booz Allen you know all those people
[49:05.200 --> 49:07.200]  and they just sit there at their desk all day
[49:07.200 --> 49:09.200]  with sophisticated internet warfare tools
[49:09.200 --> 49:12.200]  lying about us hammering us shutting us down
[49:12.200 --> 49:15.200]  that was two years ago
[49:15.200 --> 49:18.200]  because we're guilty of not wanting to throw a shot out
[49:18.200 --> 49:19.200]  and put al Qaeda in charge
[49:19.200 --> 49:21.200]  well you see years later they lost
[49:21.200 --> 49:23.200]  America won
[49:23.200 --> 49:25.200]  we did the right thing morally
[49:25.200 --> 49:27.200]  the neocon leftist Obama moved
[49:27.200 --> 49:31.200]  to back ISIS and al Qaeda failed
[49:31.200 --> 49:33.200]  and Trump just blew up a whole island
[49:33.200 --> 49:35.200]  full of ISIS last week
[49:35.200 --> 49:37.200]  the globalists are pissed
[49:37.200 --> 49:39.200]  they were running those proxy armies
[49:39.200 --> 49:42.200]  and they're also working with Hezbollah
[49:42.200 --> 49:46.200]  and Obama is advising Iran on what they're doing right now
[49:46.200 --> 49:48.200]  and he's got traders inside our government
[49:48.200 --> 49:50.200]  working against Trump just like they did against Kennedy
[49:50.200 --> 49:53.200]  in the Bay of Pigs where they set up the invasion
[49:53.200 --> 49:56.200]  to fail for the beginning to embarrass the president
[49:56.200 --> 50:00.200]  and Trump knows good and damn well what they're doing
[50:00.200 --> 50:03.200]  and so I'm very honored
[50:03.200 --> 50:07.200]  that they had the attacks out of Russia of course
[50:07.200 --> 50:10.200]  all they do is run the attacks from servers
[50:10.200 --> 50:12.200]  billions they spend up to five billion a year
[50:12.200 --> 50:15.200]  in Russia through Soros of U.S. taxpayer money
[50:15.200 --> 50:17.200]  to run stuff to overthrow Russia
[50:17.200 --> 50:20.200]  a lot of that money comes back to manipulate our elections
[50:20.200 --> 50:22.200]  and so you'll hear on the news
[50:22.200 --> 50:24.200]  oh we found a lot of Russian bots
[50:24.200 --> 50:26.200]  but they admit 80% of it's anti-Trump
[50:26.200 --> 50:28.200]  anti-patry and anti-allegations
[50:28.200 --> 50:31.200]  but technically there's a lot of action out of Russia
[50:31.200 --> 50:33.200]  well anybody can hack into your computer
[50:33.200 --> 50:38.200]  saying whitefish, Montana
[50:38.200 --> 50:40.200]  or Wyoming or whatever it is
[50:40.200 --> 50:42.200]  and then the police show up at your house
[50:42.200 --> 50:46.200]  and your computer's hacked in and launched an attack on somebody
[50:46.200 --> 50:49.200]  so we're getting 10 million visitors
[50:49.200 --> 50:51.200]  every minute or so to mfullwars.com
[50:51.200 --> 50:53.200]  and to the shopping cart
[50:53.200 --> 50:58.200]  and they're pissed they can't shut us down
[50:58.200 --> 50:59.200]  but that's America
[50:59.200 --> 51:02.200]  that's what I'm dealing with
[51:02.200 --> 51:04.200]  is the CIA leftist
[51:04.200 --> 51:08.200]  running these attacks through their Vault 7, Vault 8 systems
[51:08.200 --> 51:10.200]  through Russia
[51:10.200 --> 51:12.200]  and it's all coming from Russia
[51:12.200 --> 51:14.200]  my IT to bring it all over
[51:14.200 --> 51:15.200]  they were showing me this morning
[51:15.200 --> 51:17.200]  completely obvious
[51:17.200 --> 51:19.200]  and then they'll use that later to Congress
[51:19.200 --> 51:21.200]  and go look
[51:21.200 --> 51:23.200]  Russia's attacking America
[51:23.200 --> 51:24.200]  and use all these examples
[51:24.200 --> 51:25.200]  when they're the ones doing it
[51:25.200 --> 51:30.200]  from servers and buildings they've got leased in Russia
[51:30.200 --> 51:33.200]  oh yeah, oh yeah, Putin's attacking me right now
[51:33.200 --> 51:36.200]  sure, and the Easter Bunny's real
[51:36.200 --> 51:40.200]  so this is how America operates with these criminals
[51:40.200 --> 51:43.200]  and they think you're so stupid
[51:43.200 --> 51:44.200]  that if you go to the shopping cart
[51:44.200 --> 51:46.200]  and it's down for a few minutes here or there
[51:46.200 --> 51:48.200]  that you're not going to buy products from us
[51:48.200 --> 51:49.200]  this is a real war
[51:49.200 --> 51:51.200]  this isn't hype
[51:51.200 --> 51:52.200]  again, people think
[51:52.200 --> 51:55.200]  Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson
[51:55.200 --> 51:56.200]  and Christopher Staupersen
[51:56.200 --> 51:59.200]  and Hank Williams Jr. are outlaw country
[51:59.200 --> 52:01.200]  because they sang it different than Nashville
[52:01.200 --> 52:03.200]  they talked about smoking marijuana
[52:03.200 --> 52:05.200]  great, I love all those guys
[52:05.200 --> 52:07.200]  I've been to Lukenbach
[52:07.200 --> 52:09.200]  when I was in middle school and college
[52:09.200 --> 52:11.200]  I'm friends with Willie Nelson
[52:11.200 --> 52:15.200]  but he's not one one hundredth as outlaw as I am
[52:15.200 --> 52:17.200]  there is nothing more rebel
[52:17.200 --> 52:19.200]  nothing more outlaw than this
[52:19.200 --> 52:21.200]  and the globalists know it
[52:21.200 --> 52:22.200]  because we represent the people
[52:22.200 --> 52:23.200]  we represent you
[52:23.200 --> 52:24.200]  we don't back down
[52:24.200 --> 52:25.200]  we can't be bought
[52:25.200 --> 52:27.200]  we look for the truth and we put it out
[52:27.200 --> 52:29.200]  some Islamic country really attacks us
[52:29.200 --> 52:31.200]  we throw them off the map
[52:31.200 --> 52:33.200]  that's not what's going on here
[52:33.200 --> 52:35.200]  the neocons with the left
[52:35.200 --> 52:36.200]  are running this crap with Iran
[52:36.200 --> 52:39.200]  to derail our country right now
[52:43.200 --> 52:44.200]  and they're pissed that we're smart
[52:44.200 --> 52:45.200]  and you're smart
[52:45.200 --> 52:46.200]  and our guests are smart
[52:46.200 --> 52:48.200]  we got their number
[52:48.200 --> 52:50.200]  and so they're telling me again
[52:50.200 --> 52:52.200]  hey son
[52:52.200 --> 52:54.200]  we'll take your money away
[52:54.200 --> 52:55.200]  what, because you're a criminal?
[52:55.200 --> 52:57.200]  oh, let me give in to you
[52:57.200 --> 52:58.200]  I didn't know you were a criminal
[52:58.200 --> 52:59.200]  I didn't know you killed people
[52:59.200 --> 53:00.200]  I didn't know you were promoting
[53:00.200 --> 53:01.200]  child molestation all over television
[53:01.200 --> 53:03.200]  I have stacks of articles
[53:03.200 --> 53:05.200]  where they're promoting open pedophilia now
[53:05.200 --> 53:06.200]  and sex with kids
[53:06.200 --> 53:08.200]  and saying yes, we're pedophiles
[53:08.200 --> 53:10.200]  we're gonna have sex with your kids
[53:10.200 --> 53:13.200]  major universities on the west and east coast
[53:13.200 --> 53:16.200]  are officially saying that it's discriminatory
[53:16.200 --> 53:18.200]  and that pedophiles have a right to your children
[53:18.200 --> 53:22.200]  and the curriculum is vice
[53:22.200 --> 53:25.200]  and salon talking about sex with children
[53:25.200 --> 53:30.200]  and showing four-year-old girls in cheerleader outfits
[53:30.200 --> 53:33.200]  dancing for a drooling man
[53:33.200 --> 53:35.200]  that's next hour
[53:35.200 --> 53:37.200]  who wants to show you the soft-core porn with the kid?
[53:37.200 --> 53:39.200]  no, I'm not gonna show it
[53:39.200 --> 53:41.200]  that's the left, that's America
[53:41.200 --> 53:43.200]  so I'm under attack by these people
[53:43.200 --> 53:47.200]  wow, I must be doing things right
[53:47.200 --> 53:50.200]  San Diego State University normalizes pedophilia
[53:50.200 --> 53:51.200]  as a sexual orientation
[53:51.200 --> 53:52.200]  since it's discriminatory
[53:52.200 --> 53:54.200]  and they say emancipate children
[53:54.200 --> 53:57.200]  so they can have sex with adults
[53:57.200 --> 54:00.200]  I'm a potbellied pedophile, HIV positive
[54:00.200 --> 54:01.200]  like to date your 10-year-old daughter
[54:01.200 --> 54:02.200]  no, you can't get out of here
[54:02.200 --> 54:04.200]  I'll kick your ass, the police arrest you
[54:04.200 --> 54:07.200]  that's where it's going, that's the plan
[54:07.200 --> 54:11.200]  so let's move on to Brett Kavanaugh
[54:11.200 --> 54:12.200]  I saw this last week
[54:12.200 --> 54:15.200]  they said he needs to be impeached
[54:15.200 --> 54:18.200]  another woman said that at a party in college
[54:18.200 --> 54:20.200]  he pulled his tallywacker out
[54:20.200 --> 54:22.200]  and shoved it in her face
[54:22.200 --> 54:24.200]  none of it was true
[54:24.200 --> 54:25.200]  people actually went to the woman
[54:25.200 --> 54:26.200]  and she said, I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh
[54:26.200 --> 54:28.200]  I don't remember any of this in my life
[54:28.200 --> 54:30.200]  oh, but a couple of leftist professors
[54:30.200 --> 54:32.200]  said they remembered, see how it works
[54:32.200 --> 54:33.200]  it's always professors
[54:33.200 --> 54:35.200]  that means three letter agency
[54:35.200 --> 54:37.200]  they're all CIA folks
[54:37.200 --> 54:39.200]  that's the biggest agency
[54:39.200 --> 54:41.200]  they've all got access to your computers
[54:41.200 --> 54:42.200]  your bank account, your life
[54:42.200 --> 54:44.200]  little decoder ring
[54:44.200 --> 54:46.200]  they're all just weak little nobodies
[54:46.200 --> 54:48.200]  that just are in our business, in our lives
[54:48.200 --> 54:51.200]  lying crooks
[54:51.200 --> 54:52.200]  they think they're invincible
[54:52.200 --> 54:54.200]  what a pack of dirty people
[54:57.200 --> 54:59.200]  New York Times
[54:59.200 --> 55:01.200]  corrects their Kavanaugh
[55:01.200 --> 55:04.200]  bombshell after internet explodes
[55:04.200 --> 55:06.200]  the female student described
[55:06.200 --> 55:08.200]  to be interviewed
[55:08.200 --> 55:12.200]  and friends say she does not recall the episode
[55:12.200 --> 55:14.200]  so they used basically a real person
[55:14.200 --> 55:17.200]  not even caring it never happened
[55:17.200 --> 55:19.200]  and they make it as a footnote
[55:19.200 --> 55:21.200]  and the question post passed on
[55:21.200 --> 55:23.200]  thinly sourced Kavanaugh story before
[55:23.200 --> 55:25.200]  New York Times published it
[55:25.200 --> 55:27.200]  Trump says Kavanaugh allegation deserves libel lawsuit
[55:27.200 --> 55:29.200]  or justice department investigation
[55:29.200 --> 55:32.200]  yeah, these people are all spooks
[55:32.200 --> 55:35.200]  and they know they're lying
[55:35.200 --> 55:38.200]  they get off on it
[55:38.200 --> 55:40.200]  they screwed up at the NPR
[55:40.200 --> 55:42.200]  and they sent me a text message
[55:42.200 --> 55:44.200]  supposed to go to John Ronson
[55:44.200 --> 55:46.200]  and they go, we're having trouble finding people
[55:46.200 --> 55:48.200]  that'll follow the script
[55:48.200 --> 55:50.200]  and witnesses that'll follow script
[55:50.200 --> 55:51.200]  they have a script
[55:51.200 --> 55:54.200]  they go interview everybody from my 5a high school
[55:54.200 --> 55:56.200]  and they'll find, oh yeah
[55:56.200 --> 55:58.200]  Alex Jones tried to rape me
[55:58.200 --> 56:00.200]  and he drinks ink out of pens
[56:00.200 --> 56:02.200]  and it's supposed to sound totally wild
[56:02.200 --> 56:04.200]  because a wild thing must be true
[56:04.200 --> 56:05.200]  because it's so crazy
[56:05.200 --> 56:08.200]  like I wear swastika shoes
[56:08.200 --> 56:12.200]  I mean, that is the biggest lie on earth folks
[56:12.200 --> 56:16.200]  but that's who they are
[56:16.200 --> 56:18.200]  so here's a clip
[56:18.200 --> 56:20.200]  of Beto when he's not saying hell yes
[56:20.200 --> 56:22.200]  I'll take your guns
[56:22.200 --> 56:26.200]  here's a clip of Beto
[56:26.200 --> 56:28.200]  saying in Peach Kavanaugh
[56:28.200 --> 56:30.200]  good lord, we need criminal charges
[56:30.200 --> 56:32.200]  on the people that made this up
[56:32.200 --> 56:34.200]  because it's not just libel
[56:34.200 --> 56:35.200]  it's not just lying
[56:35.200 --> 56:37.200]  it's a coordinated racketeering fraud
[56:37.200 --> 56:39.200]  to remove someone
[56:39.200 --> 56:41.200]  that the elected government
[56:41.200 --> 56:43.200]  put in power
[56:43.200 --> 56:45.200]  as our branch of government in the judiciary
[56:45.200 --> 56:46.200]  this is racketeering
[56:46.200 --> 56:48.200]  this is psychological terrorism
[56:48.200 --> 56:49.200]  this is fraud
[56:49.200 --> 56:50.200]  this is organized crime
[56:50.200 --> 56:51.200]  here it is
[56:51.200 --> 56:54.200]  the American people deserved better
[56:54.200 --> 56:57.200]  and given the fact that it appears as though
[56:57.200 --> 57:00.200]  Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath
[57:00.200 --> 57:02.200]  which is a crime
[57:02.200 --> 57:04.200]  I think that he has disqualified himself
[57:04.200 --> 57:06.200]  for service on the Supreme Court
[57:06.200 --> 57:08.200]  he should step down
[57:08.200 --> 57:10.200]  or he should be impeached
[57:10.200 --> 57:16.200]  people can't stop lying
[57:16.200 --> 57:21.200]  I was sitting there talking to the NPR host
[57:21.200 --> 57:23.200]  a golem like creature
[57:23.200 --> 57:25.200]  and they were telling me all this stuff
[57:25.200 --> 57:26.200]  I said that's not true
[57:26.200 --> 57:28.200]  they said we're sorry the truth's coming up
[57:28.200 --> 57:30.200]  oh you want to cry now
[57:30.200 --> 57:33.200]  I was like cry
[57:33.200 --> 57:34.200]  this is all made up
[57:34.200 --> 57:35.200]  I never tried to rape a woman
[57:35.200 --> 57:37.200]  I don't drink ink out of pens
[57:37.200 --> 57:39.200]  they just started giggling
[57:39.200 --> 57:40.200]  by the way I have it all on tape
[57:40.200 --> 57:41.200]  to be part of a lawsuit
[57:41.200 --> 57:43.200]  but oh yeah
[57:43.200 --> 58:10.200]  I didn't know that Ronson
[58:10.200 --> 58:13.200]  and Infowars.com 15 years ago
[58:13.200 --> 58:14.200]  that Google was using microphones
[58:14.200 --> 58:15.200]  and hidden cameras
[58:15.200 --> 58:17.200]  to record everything you do
[58:17.200 --> 58:19.200]  and hundreds and hundreds of other
[58:19.200 --> 58:21.200]  giant issues
[58:21.200 --> 58:23.200]  like the Federal Reserve being private
[58:23.200 --> 58:24.200]  run for profit
[58:24.200 --> 58:26.200]  trying to control our economy
[58:26.200 --> 58:27.200]  that our government in Hollywood
[58:27.200 --> 58:29.200]  have been taken over by the Communist Chinese
[58:29.200 --> 58:31.200]  on every one of these issues
[58:31.200 --> 58:32.200]  and many others
[58:32.200 --> 58:34.200]  we've been dead on
[58:34.200 --> 58:35.200]  and we've raised the alarm
[58:35.200 --> 58:36.200]  on the planetary scale
[58:36.200 --> 58:37.200]  that's why the globalists

[1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:11.200]  live from the infowars.com studios
[1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:14.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:41.200]  music
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:43.200]  rain hell from above
[1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:45.200]  because
[1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:49.200]  music
[1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:51.200]  this is the home of the rebel yell my friends
[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:58.200]  music
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:01.200]  all right here's what's coming up in the shower
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:03.200]  I intend to open the phones up
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:06.200]  on the Iran Saudi Arabia
[1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:08.200]  World War 4 perspective
[1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:12.200]  to get your view and your take on that
[1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:15.200]  and I specifically also want to open the phones up
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:18.200]  to ask you is America really the greatest nation
[1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:20.200]  in the history of the world
[1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:23.200]  and I think hands down there's no debating that
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:25.200]  and I'm going to break down why
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:26.200]  but
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:28.200]  with great power comes great responsibility
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:29.200]  and with great power
[1:01:29.200 --> 1:01:31.200]  great decadence always comes
[1:01:31.200 --> 1:01:34.200]  so we're going to become if we don't stop our course
[1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:36.200]  the most evil country in the world
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:38.200]  that has the power
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:39.200]  because evil has come here
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:41.200]  to try to get control
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:43.200]  of that idea of liberty that created all this wealth
[1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:44.200]  and power
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:46.200]  it's trying to hijack it and take control of it
[1:01:46.200 --> 1:01:48.200]  so I want to talk to you about that
[1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:50.200]  I want to get your take on Kavanaugh
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:53.200]  and how they tried to set him up this time
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:54.200]  so desperate
[1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:57.200]  with a woman
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:59.200]  that they said they witnessed
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:01.200]  they shouldn't even know
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:04.200]  doesn't even remember any of this
[1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:07.200]  why didn't they just make up a fake woman
[1:02:07.200 --> 1:02:10.200]  because they just don't care
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:13.200]  it's crazy
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:16.200]  we're going to talk about that
[1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:18.200]  TI
[1:02:18.200 --> 1:02:20.200]  I've been sent this video like 15 times
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:23.200]  that means it's big
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:26.200]  asked Candace Owens
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:29.200]  when was America great
[1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:32.200]  and I want to really answer that for him
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:34.200]  I mean this guy is worth hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:37.200]  reportedly
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:40.200]  it's the only place on earth that he could do something like this
[1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:43.200]  and everybody's fighting to get here from all over the world
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:46.200]  we're taking in all these African refugees
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:49.200]  and she gets laughed at by this crowd of folks
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:52.200]  and
[1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:55.200]  it's crazy
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:58.200]  absolutely crazy what they've done for people in this country
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:01.200]  now they've taught us all to hate ourselves
[1:03:01.200 --> 1:03:03.200]  I mean
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:05.200]  Obama and Kerry and Hillary are running the Iran thing
[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:07.200]  against America right now
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:09.200]  that's why Iran is so emboldened and so arrogant
[1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:11.200]  they gave them all our codes
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:13.200]  all our secrets to the chai comms when Obama was in
[1:03:13.200 --> 1:03:15.200]  Jobs, Personnel, Hack, Google
[1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:17.200]  and Apple moved over there
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:19.200]  and Apple's given all the codes
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:21.200]  to every iPhone in the world
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:23.200]  every Apple device to them
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:25.200]  it was in Reuters
[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:27.200]  remember they said that's what happens when you move to China
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.200]  the state runs you
[1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:31.200]  see it's a hiding in plain view now
[1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:33.200]  universities are teaching
[1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:35.200]  pedophilia is good
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:37.200]  and they're going to emancipate children
[1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:39.200]  and the library is going to be full
[1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:41.200]  of teaching kids
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:47.200]  when they're approached by adults to have sex with them
[1:03:47.200 --> 1:03:49.200]  and I covered that yesterday
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:51.200]  and you're like when is it going to end
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:53.200]  it's not going to end
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:55.200]  Thomas Jefferson was famously asked
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:57.200]  how far will tyrants go
[1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:59.200]  what's their limit
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:01.200]  and
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:03.200]  he said
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:05.200]  you will live under the amount of tyranny that you accept
[1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.200]  there's always somebody crazier
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:13.200]  there's always somebody more bold
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:15.200]  there's always somebody who's willing to get into power
[1:04:15.200 --> 1:04:17.200]  and do crazy stuff and gaslight you
[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:19.200]  and hide it in plain view and we've reached
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:21.200]  a point of decadence in this country
[1:04:23.200 --> 1:04:25.200]  where the people doing all this evil
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:27.200]  their conscious mind is very evil
[1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:29.200]  but they're very genetic
[1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:31.200]  and they still don't like what they're doing
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:33.200]  so their body is rebelling against them
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:35.200]  and there's something in them
[1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:37.200]  like trying to get caught
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:39.200]  all these criminals always want to get caught
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:41.200]  so they're at the point now saying yeah we're pedophiles
[1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:43.200]  yeah we're keeping babies alive
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:45.200]  we're like that's okay that's liberal
[1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:47.200]  that's alright you go ahead and do that
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:49.200]  those of us that are aware of this
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:51.200]  and know what's wrong that are going along with it
[1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:53.200]  we're more guilty than those doing it
[1:04:53.200 --> 1:04:55.200]  did you know that?
[1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:57.200]  that's right
[1:04:57.200 --> 1:04:59.200]  silver wound gel
[1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:01.200]  is a private label
[1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:03.200]  from the top company in the U.S.
[1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:05.200]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter
[1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:07.200]  and approved for that by the FDA
[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:09.200]  we have been blessed with their listeners
[1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:11.200]  and let us private label it in the last two years
[1:05:11.200 --> 1:05:13.200]  it's been a best seller
[1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:15.200]  we convinced them to let us
[1:05:15.200 --> 1:05:17.200]  come out with a skin cream
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:19.200]  that basically mimics the top skin creams
[1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:21.200]  that are already out there
[1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:23.200]  at a lower price with their patented silver salt
[1:05:23.200 --> 1:05:25.200]  technology in it
[1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:27.200]  it's got the steric acid
[1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:29.200]  it's got the grapefruit essential oil
[1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:31.200]  it's got the nano silver
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:33.200]  coconut oil and so much more
[1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:35.200]  it's in two sizes
[1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:37.200]  super silver skin cream
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.200]  in 3.4oz and in the smaller one
[1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:41.200]  you're not going to find a product that's good anywhere
[1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:43.200]  you're certainly not going to find it at this price
[1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.200]  and it funds the info war
[1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:47.200]  at infowarslife.com
[1:05:47.200 --> 1:05:49.200]  get your super silver skin cream today
[1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:51.200]  we can only run this special
[1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:53.200]  for another week or so
[1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:55.200]  we'll be wrapping this September 10th
[1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:25.200]  we're going to talk about Sandy Hook
[1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:27.200]  my mom says he didn't write one
[1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:29.200]  it's fake news, didn't lose lawsuit
[1:06:29.200 --> 1:06:31.200]  I get all these calls saying
[1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:33.200]  man Alex sent child porn to the Sandy Hook families
[1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:35.200]  wow is he going to go to jail
[1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:37.200]  and we just show it's fake news
[1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:39.200]  it's not true
[1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:41.200]  wow I knew the media lies but
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:43.200]  it's that bad
[1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:45.200]  yeah folks it's that bad
[1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:47.200]  NPR again said that I beat up hundreds of small children
[1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:49.200]  and then I was then
[1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:51.200]  grabbed by them and taken to the country
[1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:53.200]  and all my teeth knocked out
[1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:55.200]  and they go that sounds insane
[1:06:55.200 --> 1:06:57.200]  well that's what the new Joker movie is
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:06:59.200]  he's some Tourette syndrome
[1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:01.200]  mentally ill person in his mother's basement
[1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:03.200]  and then he becomes a psychotic mass
[1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:05.200]  murderer and has armies of leftists
[1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:07.200]  that go out killing people
[1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:09.200]  and Hollywood's worshiping it
[1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:11.200]  that's their ethos
[1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:13.200]  that their victims of the system
[1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:15.200]  and they're going to overthrow it because
[1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:17.200]  they're going to be in charge
[1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:19.200]  but really they are the system now
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:21.200]  and so I look at Kavanaugh
[1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:23.200]  and
[1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:25.200]  what he's gone through
[1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:27.200]  they've now claimed that seven women
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:29.200]  say that he tried to rape them or pulled his genitals out
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:35.200]  and none of it's true
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:37.200]  and
[1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:39.200]  three of the women have been contacted and said they never met him
[1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:41.200]  it never happened people just said their names
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:43.200]  couple of the others admitted they lied
[1:07:45.200 --> 1:07:47.200]  and then
[1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:49.200]  Balazi Ford
[1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:51.200]  her lawyer says well we're glad we did it
[1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:53.200]  because he's a bad person
[1:07:53.200 --> 1:07:55.200]  he wants to get rid of baby killing
[1:07:55.200 --> 1:07:57.200]  so there's now criminal investigation
[1:07:57.200 --> 1:07:59.200]  to that
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:01.200]  and so they started the new smoke screen
[1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:03.200]  because of her lawyer saying that a week ago
[1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:05.200]  the new one is oh look
[1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:07.200]  a woman says he pulled it out in front of all these people
[1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:09.200]  and shoved it in her hand
[1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:11.200]  none of it was true
[1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:13.200]  and now they've come out and said okay we contacted the woman
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:15.200]  no one called her no one checked whether she
[1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:17.200]  even remember it that no Kavanaugh
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:19.200]  but that's the footnote
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:21.200]  and you
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:23.200]  sit back and you don't even call this media
[1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:25.200]  it's enemies of the people
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:29.200]  and when you sit there
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:31.200]  and they make up stuff
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:33.200]  from 30
[1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:35.200]  years ago
[1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:37.200]  30 years ago
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:41.200]  I was 15
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:43.200]  years old
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:45.200]  and they say
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:47.200]  we talked to a woman
[1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:49.200]  that said you said I will rape you
[1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:53.200]  and that you didn't bit the end of a black pin
[1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:55.200]  and drank it
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:57.200]  totally made up but again
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:08:59.200]  to sound like it's so implausible
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:01.200]  it must be true
[1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:03.200]  and I said that's not true
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.200]  I mean I'm not bragging or anything but I've been beating women
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:09.200]  off of a stick my whole life
[1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:11.200]  believe me I'm not into rough stuff
[1:09:11.200 --> 1:09:13.200]  and
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:15.200]  it is but that's how they steal
[1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:17.200]  your identity folks
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:19.200]  and you realize
[1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:21.200]  they are criminal liars
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:23.200]  who know their liars
[1:09:23.200 --> 1:09:25.200]  and who have been given a green light
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:27.200]  they'll pay any of the lawsuits off
[1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:29.200]  they don't care they're just going to the mat
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:31.200]  with these big trillion dollar corporations
[1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:33.200]  and the Chinese government funding a lot of it
[1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:35.200]  and it's pure war
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:37.200]  pure war
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:39.200]  but think about the arrogance
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:41.200]  they didn't even cook up maybe
[1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:43.200]  I don't want to give them ideas but a woman that died
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:45.200]  when they were going to college
[1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:47.200]  and then say women go oh she told us
[1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:49.200]  he raped them but she's dead so she can't say it
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:51.200]  they picked a woman didn't even call her
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:55.200]  so the rest of the media calls the woman
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:57.200]  she goes I never met Brett Kavanaugh
[1:09:57.200 --> 1:09:59.200]  I've never been a sexually assaulted
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:01.200]  I don't remember any of this
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:03.200]  it's all professors
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:05.200]  look at all the accusers
[1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:07.200]  or those that say they heard about accusations
[1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:09.200]  it's all professors that have worked
[1:10:09.200 --> 1:10:11.200]  for the Clintons or the Obamas
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:13.200]  who then looked
[1:10:13.200 --> 1:10:15.200]  that he was in college with them
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:17.200]  or high school
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:19.200]  and then they don't even have the nerve
[1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:21.200]  to go make it up themselves
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:23.200]  about themselves
[1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:25.200]  they pick somebody else out of the yearbook
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:27.200]  and then say it was her
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:29.200]  not even
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:31.200]  Karen
[1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:35.200]  but they got a book coming out
[1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:37.200]  the education of Brett Kavanaugh
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:39.200]  New York Times deletes bizarre tweets
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:41.200]  referencing Kavanaugh's
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:43.200]  harmless penis issues major
[1:10:43.200 --> 1:10:45.200]  correction
[1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:47.200]  book bombshell accuser has no memory
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:49.200]  never happened
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:55.200]  by the way
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:57.200]  it's come out and I know this type
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:10:59.200]  Brett Kavanaugh made straight A's in everything
[1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:01.200]  sports
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:03.200]  a couple beers on the weekend
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:05.200]  totally neurotic
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:07.200]  we all know the type
[1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:09.200]  genetic engineers
[1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:11.200]  top lawyers
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:13.200]  medical doctors
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:15.200]  Brett Kavanaugh was a virgin
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:17.200]  until he got married
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:19.200]  so was his wife
[1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:21.200]  those people still exist
[1:11:27.200 --> 1:11:29.200]  imagine being a man who was a virgin
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:31.200]  until he was out of college
[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:33.200]  being told
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:35.200]  that he's this pervert running around
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:37.200]  raping everyone
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:39.200]  but that's who they are ladies and gentlemen
[1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:41.200]  by the way
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:43.200]  Trump supposedly raped these women
[1:11:43.200 --> 1:11:45.200]  turns out they're mental patients who say this about everybody
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:47.200]  and you watch any films of Trump
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:49.200]  like the party
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:51.200]  in Florida
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:53.200]  and Epstein comes in and there's women
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:11:55.200]  super gorgeous women
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:11:57.200]  throwing themselves you can read their lips
[1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:59.200]  going let's go in the back room right now
[1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:01.200]  and Trump's got like five women
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:03.200]  not knowing which one he's going to take with him
[1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:05.200]  and then he's also a germaphobe
[1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:07.200]  so he dates girls
[1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:09.200]  he doesn't just jump and bat
[1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:11.200]  guys pull up video of Trump
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:13.200]  with Epstein
[1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:15.200]  because the real takeaway is the women all over Trump
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:17.200]  I mean the women are all over him
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:19.200]  like he's Elvis Presley
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:21.200]  it's the Miami Dolphins
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:23.200]  cheerleaders
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:25.200]  those are some real
[1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:27.200]  conservative girls let me tell you
[1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:29.200]  they're very shy
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:31.200]  let it post later
[1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:33.200]  we're live right now we'll let it post
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:35.200]  I mean this is the way
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:37.200]  all of this works
[1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:39.200]  this is the way all of this operates
[1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:41.200]  and I know as an audience
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:43.200]  you know they lie but let me tell you
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:45.200]  and when you have experienced
[1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:47.200]  packs of criminals
[1:12:49.200 --> 1:12:51.200]  knowing you're a public figure
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:55.200]  and knowing
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:12:57.200]  you to un-pull it up
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:59.200]  knowing all of this
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:03.200]  and having a formula
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:05.200]  to go out and lie
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:07.200]  about people it's just
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.200]  mind-blowing to know that it's
[1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:13.200]  never going
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:15.200]  to end
[1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:19.200]  they're just going to get worse
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:21.200]  and worse
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:23.200]  and worse
[1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:25.200]  we have let them
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:29.200]  do this forever
[1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:31.200]  and so there's no
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.200]  repercussions
[1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:35.200]  it's lawless spoiled
[1:13:35.200 --> 1:13:37.200]  yuppie criminals with intelligence
[1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:39.200]  agency badges
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:41.200]  working with media and government to just terrorize
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:43.200]  and lie
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:45.200]  and run around doing anything
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:47.200]  and everything
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:49.200]  they want
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:51.200]  and it's insane
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:13:57.200]  and it's the fall
[1:13:57.200 --> 1:13:59.200]  of civilization ladies and gentlemen
[1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:01.200]  because
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:03.200]  more and more people are like this
[1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:05.200]  more and more people are super selfish
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:07.200]  more and more people don't care
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:09.200]  more and more people are also super stupid
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:11.200]  because they're so mentally lazy
[1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:17.200]  but they don't even care about themselves
[1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:19.200]  at the end of the day
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:21.200]  and it's getting worse
[1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:27.200]  so
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:29.200]  we have to ask those of us that are productive
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:31.200]  and those of us that don't want to be part of this
[1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:33.200]  what are we going to do
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:35.200]  and at a certain point we've got to become very disciplined
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:37.200]  and not associate with the establishment
[1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:39.200]  not go to their hotels, not use their airplanes
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:41.200]  and really develop
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:43.200]  a parallel economy and system
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:45.200]  they want us out of their economy
[1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:47.200]  they don't, they want to bully us
[1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:49.200]  because they're a bunch of followers
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:51.200]  and so we have to create our own systems
[1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:53.200]  our own telephone companies
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:55.200]  our own computer companies, our own airlines
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:14:57.200]  our own car services and say hey we're the producers
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:14:59.200]  we're the conservatives
[1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:01.200]  we're the libertarians, we're the Christians
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:03.200]  we're the veterans, we're the fighters
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:05.200]  we're the humans
[1:15:05.200 --> 1:15:07.200]  the people that haven't succumbed to the decadence
[1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:09.200]  and we
[1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:11.200]  will self-segregate ourselves
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:13.200]  now from you and you can go over there and be evil
[1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:15.200]  you can go over there and be in your area
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:17.200]  but you're not going to be in our area
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:19.200]  because the truth is they want to run us
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:21.200]  and control us, they want our children
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:23.200]  and every other facet they want to conquer us
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:25.200]  because we have what they don't have
[1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:27.200]  we have the spark of creativity
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:29.200]  we have the spark of God
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:31.200]  we have the spark of liberty
[1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:33.200]  we have the spark of creation
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:35.200]  we have the spark of the future
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:37.200]  and they don't want to just conquer us
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:39.200]  they want to destroy us because they hate
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:41.200]  our superiority
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:43.200]  our existential envy situation
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:45.200]  of just evil fallen people
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:47.200]  who all resonate to their frequency
[1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:49.200]  wanting to destroy those of us
[1:15:49.200 --> 1:15:51.200]  who are not of their father death
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:53.200]  they are the children of death
[1:15:53.200 --> 1:15:55.200]  they will not go into the future
[1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:57.200]  when you have a pain in the neck
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:15:59.200]  a real pain in the neck

[1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:57.200]  we have never been closer
[1:17:57.200 --> 1:17:59.200]  to a new world war
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:01.200]  with the crisis in the Middle East
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:03.200]  with the Saudi oil fields
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:05.200]  destroyed half of their

[1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:09.200]  5% of world capacity
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:11.200]  whoever's behind it
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:13.200]  know this there are powerful forces
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:15.200]  that want a global configuration
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:17.200]  and now is the time
[1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:19.200]  to be more aware of that
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:21.200]  than ever and understand how precarious
[1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:23.200]  our position is here on this planet
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:25.200]  and that we are just
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:27.200]  mortal flawed human beings that need to
[1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:29.200]  seek God's countenance
[1:18:29.200 --> 1:18:31.200]  God's discernment
[1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:33.200]  and to pray for peace
[1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:35.200]  and to pray for transparency
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:37.200]  and to pray that the very twisted evil forces
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:39.200]  on this planet trying to start a world war
[1:18:39.200 --> 1:18:41.200]  will be exposed in their attempts
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:43.200]  at creating even bigger global crisis
[1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:45.200]  will be stopped
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:47.200]  now we'll probably avert a new world war
[1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:49.200]  hopefully but it's already
[1:18:49.200 --> 1:18:51.200]  tilting towards a global depression
[1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:53.200]  because of energy crisis
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:55.200]  we're covering it all live on the radio

[1:20:18.200 --> 1:20:36.200]  Welcome back my friends. If you're a radio listener, I would direct you to these articles I'm about to mention.
[1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:39.200]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it for yourself.
[1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:53.200]  Zero Hedge links to Washington Post and the Associated Press admitting this. Going back last year, Trump slams, carries illegal meetings with Iran which undercut the White House.
[1:20:53.200 --> 1:21:15.200]  Shadow diplomacy, ladies and gentlemen, and advising Iran on how to embarrass the White House and how to engage in asymmetric warfare, they said, and how that if they submitted or backed down to Trump, they would be kicked out of power.
[1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:25.200]  But if they fought back and then suddenly the moolas came out and said, okay, we'll start stealing ships and blocking the Strait of Hormuz, which they've begun to do. Just grab another one today.
[1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:34.200]  And then we're so against war in this country and so am I, that when Iran takes credit for stuff, people say it's fake.
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:43.200]  Or when their proxy army launches the cruise missiles, admits it and got them from Iran. They're Iranian made, they found the pieces of them.
[1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:53.200]  Oh, no, it's not Iran. They're the good guys. No, the globalist deep state is working with Iran. They're the ones that made the deal with them. That's what's going on here.
[1:21:53.200 --> 1:22:06.200]  And we're being maneuvered towards a war. And you've also got the neocons that are tied into Israel and they want a war and you've got Benjamin Netanyahu facing an uncertain election.
[1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:19.200]  But would a war really even help Israel? Iran will attack Israel with thousands of missiles. And then we're off to the races. So whether you love Israel or hate Israel, Israel's got nuclear weapons are not going anywhere.
[1:22:19.200 --> 1:22:26.200]  I guarantee you, those of you that thrown your lot in with the Muslims and have a sycophantic fetish about them and the poor Palestinians, you're crazy.
[1:22:26.200 --> 1:22:33.200]  I got problems with stuff that goes on in Israel and I got big problems with the Muslims. It doesn't matter. It's not my fight. I'm sick of this.
[1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:39.200]  I don't want a new world war and I don't want to see a plunging economy because of this. I agree with Rand Paul.
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:46.200]  But Trump slams carry legal meetings with Iran, which undercut White House. Remember that? John Kerry admits to meeting with Iran about nuclear deal.
[1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:49.200]  Lawmakers accuse him of violating Loganette.
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:23:12.200]  Former Obama official caught advising Iran on how to defeat Trump's foreign policy report. And then remember, remember all of this. It's just absolutely crazy that they think that you're going to forget all of this and just think this is all something new going on.
[1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:20.200]  This is a gulf of Tonkin, 1964, that our own government staged. That's declassified. That declassified in 2004.
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:25.200]  I'd always said it was staged. It was in the news back then. People on the ships came back and said that they staged the attack.
[1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:31.200]  Then, of course, they released the LBJ tapes 40 years later, 2004.
[1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:35.200]  And more did my credibility go up when we played those tapes on air.
[1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:45.200]  LBJ, talking about how they staged it, and McNamara telling them we just staged it, sir. And here's what you say. LBJ has actually had his ranch outside Austin saying, all right, now, what do I say again?
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:49.200]  Let me write these notes down. All right. They talk for like an hour.
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:56.200]  It's 1 a.m. in the morning, Texas time. McNamara is the Pentagon at 2 a.m., telling them out where we're going to go to war.
[1:23:56.200 --> 1:24:05.200]  We've already been in the proxy war four years, Mr. President, and we didn't let the folks know our troops are there. The media is already becoming aware of us. We're going to kick this off.
[1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:12.200]  And, well, we're going to say the ship's got attacked. Well, did they get attacked? Well, nobody's hurt. Well, this is what we were talking about. Yeah, it didn't happen, Mr. President.
[1:24:12.200 --> 1:24:20.200]  But this is what we need to get the full escalation, full commitment. McNamara says we've got Westmoreland the rest of them ready to really escalate this.
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:32.200]  And so you don't listen to the tapes. Want me to air them again for you? I get all that. This is not that. This is deep state, globalist, the EU, the Chai comms, through Obama doing this to embarrass Trump
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:40.200]  and trying to lure us into a proxy war that will kick off a Sunni Shi'ite civil war that nobody wants to be part of or in the middle of.
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:46.200]  And why would the left suddenly come out and say, plunge the economy? They're working behind the scenes.
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:55.200]  Why would they come out and say, yeah, we want to take all your semi-autos and every Democrat major candidate on that stage that we want to forcibly buy them back?
[1:24:55.200 --> 1:25:02.200]  We want to have armed robbery. Because a buyback is saying they sold them to you.
[1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:21.200]  Then they spend it and go, oh, we mean like the buybacks you've seen where it's voluntary. So that's all to drill you and protect you or program you to want to turn your firearms in because you've seen it done over and over and over again.
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:30.200]  Then they'll show some idiot, well, I turned in my AR-15 to show I'm good. And Beto goes, you're a good person. It's some Democrat party operative.
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:37.200]  It's not about protecting us. It's about enslaving us. And we know that. So why are they coming out now and admitting all of this?
[1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:43.200]  Because they're getting ready to make a major move. They're getting ready to try to trigger a civil war in this country.
[1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:47.200]  And what you see geopolitically, what you see everywhere is a larger part of that.
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:26:03.200]  Remember, Michael Moore, when President Trump had just gotten into office in January of 2017, and he said there's going to be international crises with North Korea and Iran that are going to derail President Trump.
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:08.200]  Don't worry, an international crisis is coming, particularly with Iran that will get rid of Trump.
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:17.200]  And this is it. And nasty old Obama and nasty Kerry and Hillary that have been on Chai-Kong payroll for decades, they're all maneuvering us towards that.
[1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:22.200]  But then, because it woke people up a little too much, they want to announce gun confiscation, get you used to it.
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:26.200]  But then, once you get angry, the psychology is, oh, no, no, no, we didn't mean that.
[1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:31.200]  So the next time they do it, you're not upset because you think, oh, they don't mean it.
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:34.200]  It's all telling you it's happening so you have an adrenaline rush, get upset.
[1:26:34.200 --> 1:26:41.200]  Then back off, say you didn't hear it, then announce it again, back off again, announce it again, back off again, and then finally, they start doing it.
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:45.200]  After doing it, many Democrat-controlled states right now, they're red flagged laws and taking guns everywhere.
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:54.200]  So here are the Democrats denying that they ever want to take your guns, but now they're admitting they want to take your guns, all part of psychological warfare.
[1:26:54.200 --> 1:27:10.200]  And please do not, if some of you are watching certain television stations or listening to certain radio programs, please do not believe this notion that somehow I'm out to take everybody's guns away.
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:19.200]  I'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I'm not here to take away your guns.
[1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:26.200]  The one is questioning your right to have a gun. We're not talking about taking guns away from people.
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:33.200]  They want to create the fear that the government is actually going to come after guns because that helps sell more guns than it has across the country.
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:38.200]  And I think a lot of people that are out there that are fearing what we're saying right now think that we're going to try taking their guns, we're not.
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:44.200]  The Nevergun movement and the March For Our Lives is not trying to take your guns. We're trying to take back our lives.
[1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:52.200]  This is why the NRA puts up videos that try to scare Americans. They go to emotions. They go to fear. You know, people want to take away your guns.
[1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:58.200]  Nobody wants to take away people's guns. We just don't want to be any different than Canada or Australia or Great Britain.
[1:27:58.200 --> 1:28:03.200]  Those common-sense measures would in no way infringe on any constitutional...
[1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:05.200]  That's the guy Sue, I mean, living tall, runs it all.
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:13.200] ... are stoking it. I mean, in my state, he put out an email from his campaign that was titled, They're Coming to Get Your Guns. I mean, that's how brazen some of them are.
[1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:20.200]  I am a Second Amendment supporter. I do not want to take away any gun rights that are held through...
[1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:21.200]  All around the Connecticut.
[1:28:21.200 --> 1:28:26.200]  Now, if you own an AR-15, keep it. Continue to use it responsibly and safely.
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:35.200]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:38.200]  It will be voluntary. It won't be, hell yes, we'll come get your guns.
[1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:49.200]  No, it's not voluntary. I want to make sure that we make the distinction here. It is mandatory. It will be the law. You will be required to comply with the law.
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:29:17.200]  Man, I hope nobody ever knocks Beto O'Rourke's teeth out. Those big old buck-toothed fangs.
[1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:24.200]  Our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help. Go to blackriflerealestate.com. That's blackriflerealestate.com.
[1:29:47.200 --> 1:30:05.200]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:17.200]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting. I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[1:30:17.200 --> 1:30:31.200]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson at infowars.com, 15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do at hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues.
[1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:41.200]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:52.200]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale. That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Info War.
[1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:56.200]  Please support the Info War however you can.
[1:30:56.200 --> 1:31:06.200]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:11.200]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years as a bestseller.
[1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:23.200]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented SilverSol technology in it.
[1:31:23.200 --> 1:31:33.200]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver, coconut oil and so much more.
[1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:38.200]  It's in two sizes, Super Silver Skin Cream in 3.4oz and in the smaller one.
[1:31:38.200 --> 1:31:46.200]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere. You're certainly not going to find it at this price and it funds the Info War at infowarslife.com.
[1:31:46.200 --> 1:31:55.200]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today. We can only run this special for another week or so as of taping this September 10th.
[1:31:55.200 --> 1:31:59.200]  I know most of you realize this but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:05.200]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at Info Wars and we are.
[1:32:05.200 --> 1:32:10.200]  The individuals that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan and we know how to take them down.
[1:32:10.200 --> 1:32:12.200]  That's why they're so upset.
[1:32:12.200 --> 1:32:24.200]  Think how far we've come together. You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:31.200]  The lines in the sand for everybody now. But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:41.200]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience because you are truly activist in the arena and without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support.
[1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:45.200]  This operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[1:32:45.200 --> 1:32:50.200]  We've got some giant specials running right now at InfoWarsTour.com. A lot of items, 50% off.
[1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:55.200]  Please take advantage of it at InfoWarsTour.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[1:32:55.200 --> 1:33:01.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:25.200 --> 1:33:31.200]  The war of independence had begun. The die was cast, the rebel flag unfurled.
[1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:40.200]  And on to Concord marched the foe to seize the arsenal. There you know, waiting folks, searching all around.
[1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:59.200]  Until our militia stopped them in their tracks, at the old North Bridge we turned them back and chased those Red Coasts back to Boston Town.
[1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:07.200]  Take your powder, take your gun, report to General Washington, hurry when there's not an hour to lose.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:15.200]  It happened that they had planned, if the British was ever to come over here, that they had put a light up in this high church steeple.
[1:34:15.200 --> 1:34:22.200]  And Paul went down there to look and shone up. There was the light burning brighter than day.
[1:34:22.200 --> 1:34:28.200]  Well Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he lit out. He didn't know where he was going but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[1:34:28.200 --> 1:34:38.200]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it. That old horse with his ears laid back in his nostrils wide open, sucking in wind like a jet engine, feet pounding on them cobblestones, striking off sparks.
[1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:45.200]  Paul are holding on for dear life and are hollering at the top of his lungs. He says the British is coming, the British is coming.
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:53.200]  Get your gun, we're going to have us a revolution. And them farmers come up piling out of the hay like bead out of beehive.
[1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:59.200]  Minute men there's called. What's minute men? Minute men? There's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice.
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:07.200]  And when Paul comes screeching down the road. That old's coming, that old's coming. They put their guns and hid out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere.
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:19.200]  And when the British come pranks and long hall dressed up in their red suits, they let them have it. It was a sight to see. And then it happened.
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:28.200]  They fired the gun. They fired the gun. And the shot was so loud, it was heard clear around the world.
[1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:34.200]  Oh, get out. That's the way this country started.
[1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:50.200]  And here we are. Well, you just heard Senator Blumenthal quarterbacking the attempt to take me off the air that he platforming with the CIA.
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:58.200]  His son running a lawsuit against me. They arrest Republicans. You get political office in Connecticut like the governor.
[1:35:58.200 --> 1:36:04.200]  This same law firm ran all that. Yeah, nice folks.
[1:36:04.200 --> 1:36:09.200]  And they're sworn to get your guns, get your speech, get your family, get it all.
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:13.200]  And all those public schools and libraries are teaching pedophilia now. I've got those articles right here.
[1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:17.200]  Colleges now officially say pedophiles are good people. It's just a sexual preference.
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:22.200]  We're going to get to have the pedophile liberation movement now. You're right in the middle of it.
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:29.200]  Articles are up at infowars.com and newswars.com with videos, with articles, where it's happening. You can go read the new college courses.
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:35.200]  I'm sure that'll help us compete with the world, won't it, as we export evil.
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:39.200]  There's a fight about the future of this nation, the world right now, isn't there?
[1:36:39.200 --> 1:36:46.200]  Well, Candace Owens was at a revolt TV summit about revolting and overthrowing Trump.
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:52.200]  And she was there with TI. He's in a lot of big movies, very talented rapper.
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:57.200]  I even like some of his music, but he's a big leftist.
[1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:07.200]  And he's reportedly known for his great political and verbal repertoire.
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:12.200]  But all I saw was a crowd not letting Candace Owens talk, screaming at her and laughing at her.
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:19.200]  And he says, well, tell me when America was great. I mean, what period? Everybody's trying to get here.
[1:37:19.200 --> 1:37:26.200]  We have one of the highest standard of livings in the world, certainly the best for a big country.
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:39.200]  We discovered and harnessed electricity, have more inventions than all nations combined, invented the Internet, discovered the DNA double helix,
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:46.200]  created the first atomic weapons. I'm not even saying that's a good thing, but had the freest, most open society,
[1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:52.200]  it was England that actually outlawed slavery about 60 years before we did, and then they had 11 wars,
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:57.200]  reportedly lost over a million people to end slavery. That was the abolitionist movement.
[1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:03.200]  Betsy Ross, of course, designed and created American flags. He was one of the chief abolitionists at that time.
[1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:12.200]  In 1976, it was a big movement, but they have that original sin. Africa still has four nations with slavery, black on black slavery.
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:19.200]  Somalia still has it. They teach in the Koran that blacks aren't fully human, and so that they can then be enslaved.
[1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:26.200]  And so Muslims all right now become, blacks all right now become Muslims for some reason, because the Atlantic slave trade,
[1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:30.200]  we learned that from the Muslims, but that didn't matter.
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:34.200]  Black folks have been taught that it's really sexy and cool to be a Muslim. Okay, go ahead.
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:40.200]  Because what stripe or variety of it are, I mean, at least fair contrast is that people do self-improvement, empowerment,
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:44.200]  and not be part of the whole criminal system. I care about everybody. I just want to have a good future.
[1:38:44.200 --> 1:38:54.200]  But TI, I mean, if you ask me that question, what was a great period in America, I think we've loved ourselves,
[1:38:54.200 --> 1:39:00.200]  loved what made us great, the free market, the open, wall, wall, west system, where everybody wanted to come here,
[1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:06.200]  where it was a caste system in Japan or a caste system in Nigeria or a caste system in Italy.
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:14.200]  But you could come here and get out of the caste system.
[1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:18.200]  And so America's had a lot of attributes.
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:24.200]  The French historian Alexander de Tocqueville wrote a book on it. He spent 10 years here and said,
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:26.200]  these are really unique, amazing people because they don't worship royalty or class.
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:34.200]  They love individualism and what someone really stands for and what they produce.
[1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:40.200]  And so Candace, well, I mean, here's part of the exchange, but I would love to be able to tell TI
[1:39:40.200 --> 1:39:45.200]  why America has been an exceptional nation, undoubtedly the most exceptional, but a lot of great exceptional nations.
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:49.200]  But America and the West in general and what happened in the Renaissance was amazing.
[1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:55.200]  And America was that idea carried out and look at all the inventions and all the wealth.
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:59.200]  Now, we've become decadent. That's certainly true. We've got big problems. I won't deny that.
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:03.200]  But this is a period where we abort our babies and keep them alive and take their organs.
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:09.200]  This is a period where we're being told we're a post-human world that we suck and record suicide and drug use.
[1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:13.200]  So there was a time when the family was stronger and we were more Christian.
[1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:18.200]  What you said was the 1950s, 1960s. We're not saying go back to the bad things that were there.
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:22.200]  We're saying the good things that were there that were really the Renaissance going forward.
[1:40:22.200 --> 1:40:25.200]  Here's part of that exchange.
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:30.200]  Let me tell you something. If people know what you fear, you are the easiest person to control.
[1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:35.200]  The Democrats have figured out that black America is emotionally responsive to the word racism.
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:39.200]  She says racism, you jump up and you start cheering. You haven't even listened to what I've said to rebut it.
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:44.200]  What's 100%? The biggest issue, let me finish.
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:47.200]  The biggest issue facing black America is not white supremacy.
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:53.200]  When Trump said there were good people on both sides, he was talking about the fact that some people that were in the Charlottesville rally,
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:41:00.200]  and he could have paraphrased that better, he could have said something better, literally came there because they don't believe that statues should be torn down.
[1:41:00.200 --> 1:41:08.200]  Other people came there because they were upset that amongst the people that came there to watch the statue be torn down were also white nationalists.
[1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:12.200]  So what he meant was there were some people that were just there using their first amendment right.
[1:41:12.200 --> 1:41:16.200]  There were some people that were there to respond to the white nationalists and a big mess happened.
[1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:19.200]  I'm not trying to defend him or re-litigate a situation.
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:26.200]  I'm saying that being hung up on that is allowing you to not look at an administration that is tackling so many issues in black America right now.
[1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:31.200]  I do not consider myself a Republican. I do not. I definitely am not a Democrat, but Trump woke me up.
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:38.200]  I used to be liberal. Trump woke me up to the idea that we're being manipulated by the word racism every four years.
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:41.200]  So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:42.200]  They call everybody racist.
[1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:51.200]  Alright, alright. We're going to get into this because what I'm concerned about is how is that any different than the fear that Trump has created in poor whites?
[1:41:51.200 --> 1:41:59.200]  The fear that Trump has lifted in poor whites that black people and poor urban people are their problem?
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:03.960]  That's it. That's a fallacy. When did Trump ever say black people?
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:07.760]  Great again, that's when he said guys
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:13.180]  Was that racist when Ronald slagan had it as a slogan
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:17.120]  We're gonna go back and come back with the real meat of this, but
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:22.240]  America had been a decline in the 70s because of deindustrialization and
[1:42:23.920 --> 1:42:28.680]  The drug revolution all that stuff. We had big problems super high crime rate. That was just hey
[1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:32.640]  Let's reboot the nation. Let's rebuild it. Let's believe in each other and that's what Trump say again
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:34.640]  But see oh, don't say America's great
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:41.520]  America was never great and never be that great. This is about America hating and hating yourself and only focusing on negatives
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:45.240]  And it gets really nasty on the other side. We'll air it all
[1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:46.600]  I'm Alex Jones
[1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:50.600]  info wars.com and news wars.com the only way those sites get out is when you spread them
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:53.480]  Please do it the globalists are hoping that you don't do it
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:56.600]  We have never been closer
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:00.800]  to a new world war with the crisis in the Middle East with the
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:04.280]  Saudi oil fields destroyed half of their
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:09.880]  Capacity five percent of world capacity whoever's behind it

[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:22.040]  And now is the time to be more aware of that than ever and understand how precarious our position is here on this planet
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:26.680]  And that we are just mortal flawed human beings that need to seek
[1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:32.720]  God's countenance God's discernment and to pray for peace and to pray for
[1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:36.960]  Transparency and to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet
[1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:43.200]  Trying to start a world war will be exposed to their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis will be stopped
[1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:47.320]  Now we'll probably avert a new world war hopefully, but it's already

[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:34.360]  The debate isn't whether America was ever the greatest nation on earth or is a great nation
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:37.840]  The debate really ought to be
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:42.880]  Why are they constantly telling us that we can't even say that we are a nation or that we have borders?
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:48.360]  We have sovereignty every other country controls its borders, or they're not a real government. They're not a real system
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:52.880]  Mexico puts you in jail for a year forced labor if they catch you there illegally
[1:47:52.880 --> 1:47:57.920]  And the UN is funding all these masses of people to pour into Europe to pour into here
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:00.760]  They're brainwashed these refugee camps to hate us and
[1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:06.360]  Then you see all these people at this event this revolt event

[1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:19.280]  Trump trying to stop the black babies getting aborted and it just none of it is based in
[1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:24.160]  In reality before we go back to this video Candace Owens and ti
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:32.600]  Band dot video is an excellent news site. We've launched and what's critical about it is it works great on iPhones droids
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:35.280]  laptops big-screen TVs
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:42.120]  It's got systems that are on the site that we're gonna shoot a video about soon with the IT guys explaining how it works like an app as
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:44.120]  well has a lot of great functions and
[1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:46.480]  on top of that
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:52.400]  Band dot video has the special events the live feeds and we've added Paul Watson's page
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:56.760]  We're adding Caitlyn Bennett and Millie Weaver's pages and we're gonna add a lot of other contributors
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:48:59.720]  We have firepower up there with Will Johnson and Tom Papert now
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:04.000]  But we're also creating just like they have it meme world calm
[1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:08.160]  We're gonna take all that content and put it on to a feed
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:11.760]  And we're gonna have the hottest videos of the internet posted there in a feed
[1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:17.200]  So if you're not wanting to go get a long hour long hardcore interview or you know hear me rant about World War four or whatever
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:19.640]  You're gonna be able to just go there
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:24.920]  That's being added right now in the next few days that meme world feed and that really hot video
[1:49:24.920 --> 1:49:28.640]  Not just our videos with the hottest videos on the web that are political that are informative
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:29.520]  It's all gonna be there
[1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:33.720]  So it's just gonna build and build and build because we've been kicked off YouTube Facebook Twitter everywhere
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:35.800]  We've had info worst.com for slash show
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:42.880]  It's got the four of our weekday shows and nighttime shows there more more broadcasters coming the next month or so more shows
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:46.680]  We're gonna be carrying and also producing some of these we produce and have here others
[1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:53.280]  We just carry and it'll help you on satellite and help get out to AM and FM stations as a multimedia hub for
[1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:57.760]  the true American resistance against the globalist so
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:03.760]  Please tell your Facebook your Twitter your YouTube because that's a website that isn't blackballed yet
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:05.760]  That you don't get spanked for in their rules
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:11.160]  News Wars calm isn't as blocked as well. People don't really get punished for that. You promote info wars
[1:50:11.160 --> 1:50:15.080]  I mean they will they'll kick you off Twitter or Facebook because it's we're such a free country
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:19.480]  And a lot of times when they don't it goes really viral because people are looking for info wars
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:24.480]  It's a hot commodity, but people are still used to only watching things on the feed their own and
[1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:28.080]  So I was even on another YouTube show yesterday
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:32.720]  What's the point with Brandon? They're smart guys, but the guest host says man. It was really great
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:34.160]  You know when you're on
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:39.000]  You know YouTube people could see you people are you're writing in and I'm like I'm an info wars calm
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:44.320]  I've been streaming my own streams for 20 something years. We've been having our own video streams for 17 18 years and
[1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:50.680]  When we've been hosting our own videos knowing the band was coming for four or five years and
[1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:53.160]  I mean we have some videos that get
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:55.400]  seven eight million views
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:51:01.280]  The average video gets about 30,000 views. We have videos every day. They get hundreds of thousands of views. That's big on
[1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:06.440]  On our own system info wars calm forward slash show we have the feeds at the top of info wars calm
[1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:08.600]  But now band a dot video
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:12.640]  Is the very same videos that show up with info wars? It's the same feeds the same post
[1:51:12.640 --> 1:51:15.280]  But it's organized better and it's getting better every day
[1:51:15.280 --> 1:51:19.120]  It's a first-rate site and it's gonna have a lot of content a lot of new pages
[1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:21.360]  Just go navigate that baby check it out
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:25.880]  We're gonna have events pages for all the standard shows but special events so we can update it ourselves
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:27.880]  I can even do it on my phone when I'm about to go live
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:34.160]  It's really exciting. We put a lot of money into it a lot of preparation to stay on air during the deplatforming
[1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:36.720]  So there is a resistance online during this, but
[1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:39.680]  It takes money
[1:51:39.720 --> 1:51:43.080]  I'll go to Congress and confront these globalists face-to-face as you've seen
[1:51:43.640 --> 1:51:46.880]  And I'll go to California and I'll go to New York and I'll go to Europe
[1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:52.160]  And I'll send people to cover with the clashes in Hong Kong will cover Bilderberg in Switzerland that takes money
[1:51:52.160 --> 1:51:57.600]  And again, you already know all this stuff. Don't take it for granted. Other people don't they're ready to learn
[1:51:58.080 --> 1:52:02.280]  So it's not oh Alex already know all this. Yeah, tell others now. You're a leader
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:08.080]  It's not a spectator sport and explain info wars never got taken off the air got taken off those platforms
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:11.000]  It's alive and it's reaching a lot of people
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:17.080]  But it's only gonna really be a force to be reckoned with if you spread it by hand info wars calm news wars calm
[1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:19.080]  I know most the listeners like yeah, we know this Alex
[1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:22.200]  Let me tell you everywhere. I go in public every time I'm running any people
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:26.680]  Where there's a crowd of people I get asked man. I used to love you on, you know, iTunes
[1:52:26.680 --> 1:52:30.780]  I was subscribed. I used to love you on YouTube in my feed man. I used to love you on Facebook man
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:32.800]  How is it being off air?
[1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:38.760]  Because the media said Alex Jones lost his war on info. He's off the air. Oh, yeah a couple hundred radio stations
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:40.760]  Hundred something TV cable stations
[1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:46.460]  Millions of visitors every day at info wars calm. We're not off the air, but we're mainly talking to the choir
[1:52:46.460 --> 1:52:50.160]  Well, that's good because you're the leaders
[1:52:51.420 --> 1:52:56.420]  Spread the word about the broadcast. That's how we and tell people about those local M and FM and cable stations
[1:52:56.420 --> 1:52:59.540]  However, I get emails and comments and letters all the time saying
[1:53:00.180 --> 1:53:02.180]  Can I put info wars on my car?
[1:53:02.860 --> 1:53:07.940]  Can I pay on the side of my barn or my 18-wheeler? It's like you're asking me. It's not a trademark. It's not a copyright
[1:53:07.940 --> 1:53:12.220]  It's free to air. I own info wars, but it's just an idea
[1:53:12.220 --> 1:53:18.220]  So put out your own info wars t-shirts put out your own news wars t-shirts put out your own bumper stickers
[1:53:18.380 --> 1:53:20.380]  I'm not territorializing this
[1:53:21.220 --> 1:53:27.660]  The brand is resistance to the globalist and radical Islam the New World Order and Hollywood and the pedophiles that are going public now
[1:53:27.980 --> 1:53:31.020]  My god, it's just survival for all of us in common sense
[1:53:31.660 --> 1:53:33.100]  so
[1:53:33.100 --> 1:53:37.380]  Please please understand that the general public is hotter than ever wanting to know where info wars is
[1:53:38.020 --> 1:53:39.860]  but they don't
[1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:42.660]  Understand because they used to always get it in those feats and I thought about this
[1:53:42.820 --> 1:53:46.100]  Yeah, I'm gonna get the name of the guy show pop my head like a week ago
[1:53:46.500 --> 1:53:49.500]  Pop my head a minute. I used to watch some of his YouTube videos and
[1:53:50.060 --> 1:53:56.060]  Then he got kicked off of YouTube about six months ago. Whatever that site was pop my head a minute to the other day
[1:53:56.060 --> 1:53:59.300]  I thought you know what? I'm always selling folks. Hey
[1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:05.980]  We're selling info wars calm. I thought I bet that site. I bet that that that that that gun site on YouTube
[1:54:05.980 --> 1:54:11.340]  I bet there's somewhere else and I bet they have a website. In fact, they did took about 30 minutes to remember the name
[1:54:11.340 --> 1:54:13.340]  And I'm forgot it again and find it
[1:54:14.380 --> 1:54:17.220]  There's been thousands of channels taken down as you know and when I found it
[1:54:18.020 --> 1:54:24.660]  Sure enough. He's on a bunch of platforms and it had a bunch of views. It was still alive and kicking so I'm getting mad at people for
[1:54:24.660 --> 1:54:26.300]  Not getting we're still here
[1:54:26.300 --> 1:54:31.620]  But I'm the same way. I was used to seeing them on YouTube once they were gone. I thought oh, they're just gone
[1:54:31.620 --> 1:54:33.180]  No seek them out
[1:54:33.180 --> 1:54:39.380]  Find them. That's how we get off these big platforms again and build a real internet again to surf where we all have our own systems
[1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:45.620]  We all communicate with each other and then any average person can start a site and show how you gardener how you hunt or how you paint or
[1:54:45.620 --> 1:54:51.500]  How you so or how you sing and then we surf site to site and site then we share with each other sites and it creates that real diversity
[1:54:51.780 --> 1:54:53.780]  Not these big giant
[1:54:53.820 --> 1:54:55.820]  Gulag, you know archipelago
[1:54:57.700 --> 1:54:59.700]  Systems that they've created these
[1:54:59.700 --> 1:55:06.780]  Gettos is Matt Reginald is calling. All right, let's let's continue with Candace Owens with ti then at this event saying well
[1:55:06.780 --> 1:55:08.780]  When when when when were we great?
[1:55:09.300 --> 1:55:11.300]  Well back when cancer
[1:55:11.380 --> 1:55:15.580]  Wasn't 10,000 times higher than it is now, you know back when we didn't have record suicides
[1:55:15.660 --> 1:55:18.700]  You know back when one person could work and raise a family
[1:55:18.700 --> 1:55:23.900]  You know back when we had all the inventions and all over the world people knew we were the best and we were 4% of the population
[1:55:23.940 --> 1:55:27.620]  In 1955 and had half the wealth of the world and at the biggest middle class
[1:55:27.620 --> 1:55:31.140]  And we're the ones that empowered minorities and women and all of that, you know
[1:55:31.740 --> 1:55:34.660]  And now we're told to hate ourselves by you the left here it is
[1:55:46.260 --> 1:55:48.260]  When you say make America great again
[1:55:48.740 --> 1:55:54.260]  Which period are we talking about the period when women couldn't vote the period when we were hanging from trees?
[1:55:54.260 --> 1:56:01.420]  I'll answer oh like the crack ever which period in America are you trying to make so I actually think that I would
[1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:05.180]  I would totally rock a hat right now that said make black America great again because
[1:56:10.700 --> 1:56:16.260]  Period was America great that we're trying to replicate what which ever was it
[1:56:16.260 --> 1:56:21.420]  Tell me I think I'll answer your question right answer your question
[1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:29.780]  Which ever was it what whichever was so great you here's the thing you guys are forgetting America was actually one of the
[1:56:30.300 --> 1:56:36.580]  Slavery was all over the world all over the world America. I'm not saying it's okay. So why are you saying? Oh, hey, man?
[1:56:36.580 --> 1:56:38.580]  I
[1:56:45.020 --> 1:56:48.100]  Want to be able to hear them I want to be able to hear the question
[1:56:48.100 --> 1:56:52.500]  And you're just gonna boo when I say a slavery was all over the world, which is a fact. Why are you booing a fact?
[1:56:52.500 --> 1:57:01.620]  Because you're making light. Oh, no, I'm not taking away that exclusivity. I was a slave make light of that
[1:57:08.620 --> 1:57:11.240]  She didn't that's all ad helmet in the tax
[1:57:12.620 --> 1:57:15.100]  He just keeps badgering her where she can't talk. I
[1:57:16.420 --> 1:57:19.660]  Love it's LTI when America was great back when
[1:57:19.660 --> 1:57:23.780]  And that's what you're trying to get at and I'll explain this when we come back
[1:57:24.100 --> 1:57:26.420]  Then we've got gab McGinnis joining us, but I'm explaining
[1:57:27.340 --> 1:57:34.860]  Black illegitimacy was less than 10% in 1950 down. It's almost 90% and when there was segregation wasn't a good thing
[1:57:34.860 --> 1:57:39.660]  But what does it kill you makes you stronger blacks had their own businesses and we're very wealthy on average
[1:57:39.820 --> 1:57:43.260]  That's why the left created the great society to domesticate blacks again
[1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:47.940]  We have entered a great time of change
[1:57:47.940 --> 1:57:53.700]  Social engineers to serve Satan were in control of this planet
[1:57:54.260 --> 1:57:57.580]  Believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control
[1:57:58.220 --> 1:58:05.500]  They can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government known as a technocracy in their own words
[1:58:05.500 --> 1:58:10.700]  That will manage and control and manipulate every facet of our lives at first
[1:58:11.380 --> 1:58:14.700]  They give you just a few basic things to do don't support Trump
[1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:20.100]  Don't promote Alex Jones and once you've submitted to that. Well, don't say mother and father and well
[1:58:20.100 --> 1:58:26.740]  Let us sterilize your children take these force inoculations and here take this Prozac pill and here smoke this weaponized
[1:58:27.100 --> 1:58:29.300]  Marijuana. Oh, don't be a Christian

[2:00:03.540 --> 2:00:15.220]  I asked when was America a great period? Well, this is the country where women got suffrage
[2:00:15.740 --> 2:00:18.980]  This is the country where we bring in the most immigrants
[2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:25.380]  This is the country where we pay immigrants to come here and have their babies for free and then bitching complain that needs to stop
[2:00:26.220 --> 2:00:28.220]  But I'm telling
[2:00:28.580 --> 2:00:30.580]  No, T.I. I'm not
[2:00:30.580 --> 2:00:35.900]  Lessening slavery in this country that 2% of white people had in the south
[2:00:37.540 --> 2:00:39.540]  I'm not lessening that
[2:00:41.380 --> 2:00:47.100]  And I'm not lessening that for African countries right now have slavery and
[2:00:47.860 --> 2:00:51.740]  Women are sold into slavery. I mean just type it put it on screen. I mean there's been
[2:00:52.500 --> 2:00:54.180]  London Guardian articles
[2:00:54.180 --> 2:00:56.180]  Al Jazeera articles
[2:00:56.180 --> 2:01:00.580]  Business Insider articles here. Let me show you. It's really easy
[2:01:01.540 --> 2:01:04.820]  African refugees bought sold and murdered in Libya
[2:01:06.540 --> 2:01:08.220]  That's y'all's is here
[2:01:08.220 --> 2:01:12.420]  But but let's pull up the business inside or just type in women's sold into slavery in Libya
[2:01:12.860 --> 2:01:17.660]  Boom comes up bunch of links. There's video of them being sold at the slave oxen. Let me show you
[2:01:18.940 --> 2:01:21.780]  Because this is critical. I need to show folks this I'll just do that
[2:01:21.780 --> 2:01:27.260]  So this is all going on men women all sold as slavery
[2:01:27.740 --> 2:01:29.740]  Let's say hey T.I. You
[2:01:30.540 --> 2:01:32.540]  Concerned about that or is it all?
[2:01:32.940 --> 2:01:35.180]  Complaining about America and then tell us how we're bad
[2:01:35.180 --> 2:01:38.660]  So we're guilty even though none of us own slaves and we've done nothing wrong
[2:01:39.060 --> 2:01:41.340]  So that I guess politically we have to do what you say
[2:01:42.900 --> 2:01:48.780]  Yeah, there it is humans were reportedly being sold as slaves for four dollars each on the front line of the migrant crisis
[2:01:48.780 --> 2:01:50.780]  Do me a favor print me all those articles?
[2:01:52.700 --> 2:01:57.220]  It'd be really neat if I could just hand all those to T.I. You know, I never really get my wishes to
[2:02:02.220 --> 2:02:08.020]  People say well, why didn't Candace do a better job don't know she tried to she got shouted down by the moderator by T
[2:02:08.020 --> 2:02:10.020]  I by the crowd
[2:02:11.420 --> 2:02:13.980]  Who sit there with their smartphones their fancy clothes
[2:02:13.980 --> 2:02:18.860]  Where the poorest people in America live better than most people in third-world nations?
[2:02:19.940 --> 2:02:21.940]  And the guy in the middle looks like you know
[2:02:23.260 --> 2:02:25.260]  He eats enough for 20 people
[2:02:25.500 --> 2:02:27.300]  job of the hut and
[2:02:27.300 --> 2:02:35.540]  He's there just getting pissed when somebody says America doesn't suck but boy. I tell you thousands of people come here illegally a day
[2:02:36.580 --> 2:02:38.580]  from Africa and
[2:02:38.620 --> 2:02:42.860]  the day they get here leftist white people they're taking them with open arms and
[2:02:42.860 --> 2:02:47.980]  Marching them through to get them on all the welfare and all the goodies the government just catches and releases
[2:02:48.980 --> 2:02:56.380]  And then I see those people later on the news talking crap about America how much it sucks. Let me tell you're in Africa
[2:02:56.940 --> 2:02:58.940]  Help guys cue that up
[2:02:58.980 --> 2:03:02.660]  Just one gab McGinnis comes on. Let's show some of the blacks burning blacks
[2:03:03.180 --> 2:03:08.620]  Willy Mandela was a big expert on that because they're not from South Africa. They're murdering them and the black guys
[2:03:08.620 --> 2:03:10.620]  Don't murder your brothers kill the white people
[2:03:10.620 --> 2:03:13.820]  Like Robert Mugabe did in Zimbabwe and through this
[2:03:14.540 --> 2:03:18.260]  Africa's super tribal super violent before white people ever got there
[2:03:18.900 --> 2:03:20.900]  And I'm not knocking the folks in Africa
[2:03:21.220 --> 2:03:29.020]  I'm just saying the West ladies and gentlemen is where everybody wants to get because we treat people on average really good
[2:03:29.260 --> 2:03:31.260]  and we built a civilization and
[2:03:31.900 --> 2:03:36.580]  so the idea that you come here and you get it all and you bitch and because
[2:03:36.580 --> 2:03:40.100]  it's a hundred and seventy years ago or 160 years ago
[2:03:41.780 --> 2:03:47.380]  Some people had slaves in this country and then they got slaves all over the world people are slaves in North Korea
[2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:49.540]  Most people are slaves in China
[2:03:49.860 --> 2:03:53.620]  People are slaves all over the surf didn't get freed in Russia till the 1880s
[2:03:54.260 --> 2:03:58.180]  There were there were slaves all over Germany white slaves till the 1880s
[2:03:58.180 --> 2:04:05.380]  Imagine most people that moved from Germany since then don't even know they came from surf surf being slave. I
[2:04:07.860 --> 2:04:13.900]  Would sit here if I had some indentured servant background sure I do oh my god. I'm a slave, you know
[2:04:13.900 --> 2:04:18.220]  I need some reparations and the government's over gonna give you reparations
[2:04:18.380 --> 2:04:23.980]  We're gonna give you that with strings attached where you do exactly as we say and you live the way we want you to
[2:04:24.420 --> 2:04:26.220]  you politically
[2:04:26.220 --> 2:04:32.780]  Go along with our system. That's domestication. That's buying the people off and then folks think if they become victims and whine and complain
[2:04:32.780 --> 2:04:34.780]  They're gonna get a bunch of free goodies. Oh
[2:04:35.380 --> 2:04:41.700]  Like in the 60s when LBJ created welfare for black folks said I'll have these inwards vote and democratic for 100 years
[2:04:41.700 --> 2:04:45.900]  He said they got two companies as a quotes with their own businesses because I'm gonna break those families up
[2:04:45.900 --> 2:04:48.420]  I'm gonna pay them inward women to throw their men out
[2:04:49.380 --> 2:04:52.620]  And they sure as hell did it didn't they they got these pimps
[2:04:52.620 --> 2:04:58.860]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue. You've been selling it for over a year

[2:06:23.980 --> 2:06:30.980]  Oh really? We're not just on the internet like the globalists thought. We're on hundreds of radio stations and our own band.video
[2:06:30.980 --> 2:06:34.980]  It's not going as easily as you thought it would. New World Order
[2:06:34.980 --> 2:06:42.980]  That's why as soon as they launched all these attacks and the deep states directing Iran's or Obama and John Kerry trying to get trick
[2:06:42.980 --> 2:06:44.980]  Trump into a war
[2:06:44.980 --> 2:06:50.980]  We're here exposing it. Boom. They hit us with the novel service attacks trying to take down the websites of the shopping cart today
[2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:55.980]  But they failed and we're still standing thanks to all of you in FullWars.com
[2:06:55.980 --> 2:07:02.980]  Joining us is Gavin McGinnis. He founded BICE magazine and TV and all of it
[2:07:02.980 --> 2:07:08.980]  And of course has launched a lot of other major movements is why he's one of the only people as banned as I am
[2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:14.980]  FreeSpeech.tv and boy, what should we cover? It's always a treat to be able to get him on with this
[2:07:14.980 --> 2:07:22.980]  Gavin, do you want to hit the latest Kavanaugh where they just admit that they just made it up again?
[2:07:22.980 --> 2:07:26.980]  Why'd they do that? Why don't they care? Do you want to hit the World War 4 brewing in the Middle East?
[2:07:26.980 --> 2:07:28.980]  Who do you think is really behind that and all this craziness?
[2:07:28.980 --> 2:07:34.980]  You want to hit the Democrats saying of course we're going to take all your guns or maybe TI going up your can to sell us
[2:07:34.980 --> 2:07:39.980]  Everyone's like, when was America great? They're like, yeah, this place sucks. That's why we're all trying to get in here
[2:07:39.980 --> 2:07:46.980]  I mean there's just so much craziness going on. It's getting nuttier and nuttier. Good to have you on from FreeSpeech.tv
[2:07:46.980 --> 2:07:52.980]  Thanks for having me. Yeah, let's cover all of it. I mean the TI thing, what a lot of people don't understand about Make America Great Again
[2:07:52.980 --> 2:08:01.980]  is no one's talking about going back to the 1900s. They're not talking about going back to slavery. They're really just talking about 1985
[2:08:01.980 --> 2:08:09.980]  We want to get back to Ronald Reagan. We want to get back to when it was cool to make money and be proud of your country and be patriotic
[2:08:09.980 --> 2:08:21.980]  and we didn't have, as we learned about in Montreal today, a one room only changing room where little girls are next to a grown man totally naked drying himself off
[2:08:21.980 --> 2:08:26.980]  We want to get away from that and back to maybe just 20 years ago
[2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:34.980]  Let me stop you. I know that Chris Cuomo said two years ago that we need to have full grown men in showers with kids at public schools
[2:08:34.980 --> 2:08:42.980]  and if your 10 year old girl doesn't want to see a man's ding dong, that she's a bigot. That was his tweet. What's going on in Montreal?
[2:08:42.980 --> 2:08:54.980]  So Montreal gets progressively more French as you go east and in an area called Rosemont, they just opened up a pool and there's one big changing room
[2:08:54.980 --> 2:09:02.980]  Men, women, old ladies, some seven year old girl is going to see a 70 year old's testicles
[2:09:02.980 --> 2:09:07.980]  What's the headline? I want to pull that up. Montreal pool only has one changing room?
[2:09:07.980 --> 2:09:08.980]  Yeah
[2:09:08.980 --> 2:09:12.980]  Wow, we'll get that pulled up. Please continue
[2:09:12.980 --> 2:09:20.980]  So when we say make America great again, we obviously don't mean separate drinking fountains. We obviously don't mean slavery
[2:09:20.980 --> 2:09:28.980]  We obviously don't want to injure a second civil war where if it was the same population distribution, it would be 5 million
[2:09:28.980 --> 2:09:37.980]  We lost 620,000. That would be 5 million today. We obviously don't want 5 million to die fighting against slavery and against the civil war
[2:09:37.980 --> 2:09:43.980]  against the south fighting the north. We obviously don't want to return to that. We want to get back to the 80s when it was fun
[2:09:43.980 --> 2:09:52.980]  Even the 90s, people were cool and getting along. Even in the early 2000s, you had Obama and Hillary talking about closed borders
[2:09:52.980 --> 2:09:54.980]  and Bill Clinton saying we need to deploy
[2:09:54.980 --> 2:10:00.980]  What we want is 5 year olds not being taught to get in vans with men and have sex with them. That's literally being taught in public schools
[2:10:00.980 --> 2:10:03.980]  What we want is to not have San Diego State University. That's on enforce.com
[2:10:03.980 --> 2:10:06.980]  St. pedophilia is a good thing. It is a sexual preference
[2:10:06.980 --> 2:10:13.980]  What we don't want is totally open borders with people with leprosy and TB and typhus pouring across with no testing at all
[2:10:13.980 --> 2:10:16.980]  They had 6 months of testing there at Ellis Island
[2:10:16.980 --> 2:10:23.980]  What we want is to not hear we suck and not hear we're bad and not have the media hype race war constantly and stuff like that
[2:10:23.980 --> 2:10:27.980]  Exactly. We didn't talk about racial identity politics 10 years ago at all
[2:10:27.980 --> 2:10:32.980]  I saw a great graph of this too and it said how much time whiteness was mentioned in the media
[2:10:32.980 --> 2:10:37.980]  And from the 50s on to 2000 almost it was pretty normal
[2:10:37.980 --> 2:10:42.980]  And then it's just spiked in the past 10 years to absurd proportions
[2:10:42.980 --> 2:10:47.980]  Everything is race all the time and black people are sick of it
[2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:50.980]  They're sick of being defined by the race. Oh, you're a black person
[2:10:50.980 --> 2:10:56.980]  It's sort of like you ever hang out with a super tall guy who's like 6 6 every single where he goes people say
[2:10:56.980 --> 2:10:59.980]  Oh, man, how tall are you? What are you like 6 6 6?
[2:10:59.980 --> 2:11:03.980]  I've never heard that before. Yeah, do you ever play basketball?
[2:11:03.980 --> 2:11:08.980]  Someone has a birthmark on the side of his head and every time a liberal woman would come around at the lake or the pool
[2:11:08.980 --> 2:11:11.980]  They'd walk him and go, honey, did somebody hit you? Was it this man?
[2:11:11.980 --> 2:11:15.980]  And by the time it was 5 o'clock, that's my daddy. I have a birthmark
[2:11:15.980 --> 2:11:20.980]  But the left is so neurotic and hyper weird and they're always horning in on places
[2:11:20.980 --> 2:11:27.980]  They're not supposed to be inserting themselves like we're gonna come in your little girl's bathroom. They're gonna see our ding-dongs
[2:11:27.980 --> 2:11:34.980]  Yeah, they really do feed on the darkness this whole cool culture of I hope I die before I get old and the opioid epidemic
[2:11:34.980 --> 2:11:41.980]  I would even argue that Greta Thurnberg the fact that she's suicidal is a big part of her appeal, especially to Swedes
[2:11:41.980 --> 2:11:48.980]  Especially the northern Europeans. Yeah, let's talk about her flying around on jumbo jets everywhere and just arrogantly telling us what to do
[2:11:48.980 --> 2:11:56.980]  She's not just spreading eco friendly environmental awareness. She's spreading suicide. She hates humans
[2:11:56.980 --> 2:12:02.980]  She hates herself. She hates living and the the academic Swedes. They love the idea of cannibalism
[2:12:02.980 --> 2:12:05.980]  In fact, they were promoting it last week saying we should eat human flesh
[2:12:05.980 --> 2:12:12.980]  They love this idea of mass suicide mass death. They don't want to live. They don't love this country. They don't love living
[2:12:16.980 --> 2:12:17.980]  She's evil
[2:12:17.980 --> 2:12:20.980]  It's totally whacked out. Let me ask you this
[2:12:20.980 --> 2:12:27.980]  Where do you? I asked you this like three years ago and you said it's never gonna end. When do we have peak SJW?
[2:12:27.980 --> 2:12:31.980]  I mean, I guess it's when they say burned on our houses kill us enslave us
[2:12:31.980 --> 2:12:38.980]  Overthrow reality. I mean, they're just not gonna stop and they get more radical by the day and they're just coming out with everything that they're doing
[2:12:38.980 --> 2:12:41.980]  What do you think they're up to?
[2:12:41.980 --> 2:12:54.980]  Well, 2020 is gonna be an absolute madhouse. You know, I think what's what surprises me about all these radical politics is how quickly the normal moderate liberals just inhale it all
[2:12:54.980 --> 2:13:02.980]  It's sort of like Islam. I mean, we had the Wahhabists come in there and was that what they're called? Yeah, whatever they're called the Wahhabists
[2:13:02.980 --> 2:13:10.980]  100 years ago, most Muslim women were not even wearing headdresses or a jib. Now they're all wearing beekeeper suits. So it's just a total radicalization
[2:13:10.980 --> 2:13:21.980]  Look at Iran in 1978 was it looked like New York City, beautiful place, but they let themselves get infected by radical Islam and it putrified the entire religion
[2:13:21.980 --> 2:13:30.980]  The left is like this with these radicals like Antifa will tell them something and they'll go, oh, okay, like there was just a cop who was fired
[2:13:30.980 --> 2:13:45.980]  Sheriff fired him seven days into his career because they found these posts that were six years old on Facebook when he obviously wasn't a cop where he was saying things like I'd die for this country and Islam is a threat to America and pretty tame stuff
[2:13:45.980 --> 2:13:50.980]  But because Antifa contacted the chief of police, boom, he's gone
[2:13:50.980 --> 2:14:05.980]  Hey, what about the volunteer firefighter who tried to join Proud Boys so the city last week disbanded the whole fire department. They've been around 100 years and let the town burn down because oh my God, firefighting is American. Get rid of that
[2:14:05.980 --> 2:14:17.980]  And that would be one thing if there's all these crying housewives saying he's ignored our family fires and this this firehouse is racist and they won't go to black homes and won't go to trans homes we've had enough
[2:14:17.980 --> 2:14:29.980]  I would understand that you kind of got a point. No, it was just because Antifa contacted the city council member and went, oh, I don't want to be embarrassed by a bunch of radical anarchists who cover their face and attack people and honestly
[2:14:29.980 --> 2:14:35.980]  And how they get the virtuous signaling and groveling to these bullies only makes it get more intense more crazy
[2:14:35.980 --> 2:14:52.980]  Yeah, and who kowtows to lunatics so fast. I mean, imagine the imagine the right imagine conservatives, moderate libertarians, kowtowing to Nazis, they get the some radical alt right group that you know denies the holocaust and hates black people
[2:14:52.980 --> 2:15:02.980]  They send out a tweet to a moderate conservative like, okay, okay, okay, he's fired. He's fired. I wouldn't want to offend you. Like why does the left capitulate to their radicals so
[2:15:02.980 --> 2:15:12.980]  And that's the thing when we come back I want you to describe as the founder of the proud boys and all the demonization and the latest on being convicted in New York for defending themselves on video
[2:15:12.980 --> 2:15:24.980]  How would you describe Antifa because when you see them with their mask off at their own meetings they look like they escape from mental institutions. They can barely talk they they're eating their boogers they have tracks all over their arms
[2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:32.980]  They're devil worshipers they're almost always into pedophilia when they have undercover videos that you know they'll have only have the local Nambla chapter oh great
[2:15:32.980 --> 2:15:42.980]  And the leaders like I'm Nambla too and it's like weird meth head white pedophiles that everyone just bows oh god oh and they go to Mitch McConnell's house and say we're going to kill you
[2:15:42.980 --> 2:15:52.980]  Twitter leaves that up. McConnell goes look they came to my house and Twitter goes you're banned oh you can't speak out against them saying they're going to stab you in the heart

[2:17:53.980 --> 2:18:03.980]  Super silver wound gel is a private label from the top company in the US that has their products and hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA
[2:18:03.980 --> 2:18:08.980]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years has been a bestseller
[2:18:08.980 --> 2:18:20.980]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented SilverSol technology in it
[2:18:20.980 --> 2:18:30.980]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more
[2:18:30.980 --> 2:18:38.980]  It's in two sizes super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one you're not going to find a product that's good anywhere

[2:18:52.980 --> 2:18:57.980]  I know most of you realize this but I'm going to say it again very very clearly
[2:18:57.980 --> 2:19:02.980]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at info wars and we are
[2:19:02.980 --> 2:19:07.980]  The individuals that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan and we know how to take them down
[2:19:07.980 --> 2:19:09.980]  That's why they're so upset
[2:19:09.980 --> 2:19:11.980]  Think how far we've come together
[2:19:11.980 --> 2:19:15.980]  You know even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do
[2:19:15.980 --> 2:19:21.980]  Against the truly satanic forces of the new world order who've really taken the mask off
[2:19:21.980 --> 2:19:23.980]  The lines in the sand for everybody now
[2:19:23.980 --> 2:19:28.980]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn
[2:19:28.980 --> 2:19:34.980]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience because you are truly activist in the arena
[2:19:34.980 --> 2:19:38.980]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support
[2:19:38.980 --> 2:19:42.980]  This operation that you built that your operation would not be here

[2:20:13.980 --> 2:20:17.980]  Alright, Gavin McGinnis with this one more segment
[2:20:17.980 --> 2:20:21.980]  I'm going to give the number out next segment to get into the World War 4 scenario
[2:20:21.980 --> 2:20:23.980]  The Cold War was World War 3
[2:20:23.980 --> 2:20:27.980]  The situation, where do you think that's going with Iran and Saudi Arabia?
[2:20:27.980 --> 2:20:31.980]  What do you think about all these people saying America was never great?
[2:20:31.980 --> 2:20:34.980]  How do you respond to something like that when people are still fighting to get into the country?
[2:20:34.980 --> 2:20:35.980]  It's just asinine
[2:20:35.980 --> 2:20:38.980]  But Gavin McGinnis liked my last question
[2:20:38.980 --> 2:20:40.980]  So in this segment I want him to have the floor
[2:20:40.980 --> 2:20:43.980]  You've found out the Proud Boys, you've got a lot about demonized for it
[2:20:43.980 --> 2:20:45.980]  Now they're arresting Proud Boys that defend themselves
[2:20:45.980 --> 2:20:47.980]  You've studied Antifa, you really know who they are
[2:20:47.980 --> 2:20:50.980]  Why they're protected by the corporate media, by universities
[2:20:50.980 --> 2:20:55.980]  Who are the five factions of Antifa and why are they so protected?
[2:20:55.980 --> 2:20:57.980]  Okay, let's start at the bottom
[2:20:57.980 --> 2:21:01.980]  At the very bottom there's those meth head losers you were just talking about
[2:21:01.980 --> 2:21:05.980]  They often are abandoned by their biological family
[2:21:05.980 --> 2:21:07.980]  They often have a dead dad
[2:21:07.980 --> 2:21:10.980]  The guys that attacked the Proud Boys in New York, Finbar Slonim
[2:21:10.980 --> 2:21:12.980]  He goes by the name of Solange Slonim
[2:21:12.980 --> 2:21:14.980]  He recently lost his dad
[2:21:14.980 --> 2:21:18.980]  And those guys make easy prey for the top brass at Antifa
[2:21:18.980 --> 2:21:20.980]  They're sort of like orphans
[2:21:20.980 --> 2:21:23.980]  And you get people like Yvette Falarka who take them in
[2:21:23.980 --> 2:21:26.980]  And feed them and give them a place to stay
[2:21:26.980 --> 2:21:29.980]  And then they're beholden to their hosts to do something for the cult
[2:21:29.980 --> 2:21:31.980]  And make no mistake about it, this is a cult
[2:21:31.980 --> 2:21:33.980]  They're the paramilitary wing of the DNC
[2:21:33.980 --> 2:21:38.980]  They're protected by rich lawyers who work for globalists
[2:21:38.980 --> 2:21:41.980]  But they are all members of this cult
[2:21:41.980 --> 2:21:45.980]  And you don't really see this bottom tier too much in New York
[2:21:45.980 --> 2:21:49.980]  It's more like Southern California, you see this in Berkeley
[2:21:49.980 --> 2:21:52.980]  You see this in Oakland, those are the panhandling losers
[2:21:52.980 --> 2:21:55.980]  You also see them in Portland, these poor bastards
[2:21:55.980 --> 2:21:58.980]  Now one up from them, you have the rich white kids
[2:21:58.980 --> 2:22:03.980]  And they are probably 70% of total Antifa everywhere
[2:22:03.980 --> 2:22:07.980]  These rich white kids tend to be the children of academics
[2:22:07.980 --> 2:22:12.980]  And they tend to be steeped in Marxism their entire lives
[2:22:12.980 --> 2:22:14.980]  They're all wimps, they can't fight
[2:22:14.980 --> 2:22:17.980]  They've never really been in a fight, they're very sadistic
[2:22:17.980 --> 2:22:19.980]  And these are the kind of guys that will kick you when you're down
[2:22:19.980 --> 2:22:22.980]  Hit you with a pole while you're unconscious
[2:22:22.980 --> 2:22:27.980]  Really cruel, bizarre people who I think feel insecure about their lack of conflict
[2:22:27.980 --> 2:22:32.980]  They will target people in wheelchairs, they will target old women, they will target children
[2:22:32.980 --> 2:22:38.980]  Yes, when you see the violence, it's hard to determine whether it's the rich kids or the poor kids
[2:22:38.980 --> 2:22:41.980]  Because they're both brutally sadistic, but there's different purposes
[2:22:41.980 --> 2:22:46.980]  When the poor kids attack, they're trying to appease their Yvette Falarka hosts and earn their keep
[2:22:46.980 --> 2:22:51.980]  When the rich kids attack, they're trying to make up for the fact that they've had no troubles in their lives
[2:22:51.980 --> 2:22:54.980]  And want some culture, they want some grit
[2:22:54.980 --> 2:22:57.980]  Above that, you have these sort of shot callers
[2:22:57.980 --> 2:23:02.980]  And you'll see them at the Antifa rallies where they're on their phones the whole time
[2:23:02.980 --> 2:23:06.980]  They determine who goes where, they're the sort of lieutenants of the battle
[2:23:06.980 --> 2:23:10.980]  And they are one down from the rich lawyers
[2:23:10.980 --> 2:23:14.980]  The lawyers are these, they tend to be lesbians, I've noticed
[2:23:14.980 --> 2:23:17.980]  And they're the ones who give out these beautiful signs that all match
[2:23:17.980 --> 2:23:22.980]  And have been done at Staples, on Foamcore, and have great graphic design
[2:23:22.980 --> 2:23:27.980]  And they pass out all the flags, they're also the ones, by the way, who bequeath lawyers
[2:23:27.980 --> 2:23:30.980]  When these two bottom tiers get in trouble
[2:23:30.980 --> 2:23:33.980]  And then at the very top, we have the money source
[2:23:33.980 --> 2:23:40.980]  These are the guys with suits who deal with the funds, who deal with hope not hate and the SPLC and the ADL
[2:23:40.980 --> 2:23:45.980]  They're the ones who funnel the money from the rich guys and then get it to these lower tiers
[2:23:45.980 --> 2:23:48.980]  And the amazing thing about it is they all work together
[2:23:48.980 --> 2:23:54.980]  So you have someone like Cuomo de Blasio, he says we have to stop hate in America
[2:23:54.980 --> 2:23:58.980]  That goes down to the guy handling the money, goes down to the lesbian lawyers
[2:23:58.980 --> 2:24:03.980]  Go down to the shot callers and eventually ends up with the rich academics and the scumbags
[2:24:03.980 --> 2:24:05.980]  Who go out there on the streets and get into trouble
[2:24:05.980 --> 2:24:08.980]  None of these top three ever get their hands dirty
[2:24:08.980 --> 2:24:14.980]  Even after they're exposed and we follow the money, they receive no shaming, no nothing
[2:24:14.980 --> 2:24:17.980]  Because the media is complicit in all of this
[2:24:17.980 --> 2:24:21.980]  The media needs all five of these factions in order to get rid of Trump
[2:24:21.980 --> 2:24:23.980]  In order to push the DNC narrative
[2:24:23.980 --> 2:24:25.980]  So they're complicit in all of it
[2:24:25.980 --> 2:24:27.980]  And they just get away with impunity
[2:24:27.980 --> 2:24:29.980]  I mean, they're at the point now where they just brag
[2:24:29.980 --> 2:24:31.980]  They brag about how they kick our asses
[2:24:31.980 --> 2:24:37.980]  And the night when Proud Boys got arrested and are facing 15 years for defending themselves
[2:24:37.980 --> 2:24:42.980]  There was an earlier fight with Caleb Perkins, Finn Barcelona, the guy whose dad died
[2:24:42.980 --> 2:24:48.980]  And Kai Russo and these guys, among seven other people, attacked a journalist, beat the crap out of him
[2:24:48.980 --> 2:24:50.980]  Took his stuff, nothing
[2:24:50.980 --> 2:24:52.980]  No media attention, no tweets
[2:24:52.980 --> 2:24:55.980]  I think they got probation and misdemeanor
[2:24:55.980 --> 2:24:57.980]  No criminal records, nothing
[2:24:57.980 --> 2:25:01.980]  Whereas the guys who actually defended themselves stood their ground
[2:25:01.980 --> 2:25:04.980]  As we learned is a sin from the Covenant Catholic school boys
[2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:06.980]  Those guys who stood their ground
[2:25:06.980 --> 2:25:10.980]  15 years, they'd be happy with nine years
[2:25:10.980 --> 2:25:12.980]  This is for a 17-second bar room brawl
[2:25:12.980 --> 2:25:16.980]  And I'll be stunned if they get less than two years
[2:25:16.980 --> 2:25:22.980]  In prison, in jail, in New York State for defending yourself and being a patriot
[2:25:22.980 --> 2:25:24.980]  Gavin, you're just on fire
[2:25:24.980 --> 2:25:26.980]  I mean, you really are a smart guy
[2:25:26.980 --> 2:25:30.980]  It's why they fear you, you launched so much of the hipster movement
[2:25:30.980 --> 2:25:33.980]  I mean, you've already launched four or five big movements
[2:25:33.980 --> 2:25:34.980]  That's why they're so scared of you
[2:25:34.980 --> 2:25:35.980]  That's why they're scared of me
[2:25:35.980 --> 2:25:38.980]  We're not bragging, they're scared of anybody that is real
[2:25:38.980 --> 2:25:40.980]  That people like, that people know are telling the truth
[2:25:40.980 --> 2:25:44.980]  And you just laid it all out that that is exactly who they are
[2:25:44.980 --> 2:25:47.980]  And then Alexander Soros is now the biggest patron
[2:25:47.980 --> 2:25:50.980]  Putting hundreds of millions and we even got documents from family members
[2:25:50.980 --> 2:25:52.980]  We'll put it on screen for TV viewers
[2:25:52.980 --> 2:25:56.980]  Where they describe exactly what you said from the top down
[2:25:56.980 --> 2:25:58.980]  And the action plans and the battle plans
[2:25:58.980 --> 2:26:01.980]  This is from level three and level four of the documents we got
[2:26:01.980 --> 2:26:05.980]  That are real documents, how they even work with police in Portland and in Baltimore
[2:26:05.980 --> 2:26:09.980]  And the areas they're allowed to attack and how they're trying to cause
[2:26:09.980 --> 2:26:12.980]  The black population to rise up, particularly in Baltimore
[2:26:12.980 --> 2:26:16.980]  This is smoking gun, criminal racketeering terrorism
[2:26:16.980 --> 2:26:18.980]  Confidential level seven, ABG
[2:26:18.980 --> 2:26:21.980]  I mean, these people are an organized crime syndicate
[2:26:21.980 --> 2:26:23.980]  And the media ignores it
[2:26:23.980 --> 2:26:25.980]  Look at the way they treat the SPLC
[2:26:25.980 --> 2:26:28.980]  The NRA, their president stepped down
[2:26:28.980 --> 2:26:30.980]  They stopped doing their TV show
[2:26:30.980 --> 2:26:31.980]  That's the end of the NRA
[2:26:31.980 --> 2:26:33.980]  Oh, the media is dancing in the streets
[2:26:33.980 --> 2:26:34.980]  They're obliterated, they're over
[2:26:34.980 --> 2:26:38.980]  Meanwhile, the SPLC, Morris D's, is shamed
[2:26:38.980 --> 2:26:40.980]  His entire career flushed down the toilet
[2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:42.980]  The guy's exposed as a fraud
[2:26:42.980 --> 2:26:45.980]  He's fired from the SPLC, which he founded
[2:26:45.980 --> 2:26:47.980]  The president, Richard Cohen, steps down
[2:26:47.980 --> 2:26:49.980]  Their head of legal steps down
[2:26:49.980 --> 2:26:52.980]  They get Tina Chen to come in and try to save their brand
[2:26:52.980 --> 2:26:54.980]  She ends up being involved in the justy small thing
[2:26:54.980 --> 2:26:56.980]  She's ruined
[2:26:56.980 --> 2:27:00.980]  And the media still cites the SPLC on a daily basis
[2:27:00.980 --> 2:27:02.980]  As this valid source
[2:27:02.980 --> 2:27:05.980]  The SPLC is enshrined in gold
[2:27:05.980 --> 2:27:07.980]  In the media's mind, in their narrative
[2:27:07.980 --> 2:27:11.980]  Yet every other slightly right group is destroyed
[2:27:11.980 --> 2:27:14.980]  The second they have a grumpy Monday
[2:27:14.980 --> 2:27:16.980]  We're not getting the news
[2:27:16.980 --> 2:27:18.980]  I meant to give this article, I didn't even cover it, Sonny
[2:27:18.980 --> 2:27:20.980]  There's so many cases, I'll pull up the name of stuff in a minute
[2:27:20.980 --> 2:27:25.980]  Another black NFL former player got caught by police
[2:27:25.980 --> 2:27:28.980]  In Atlanta, tearing up his own pizza place
[2:27:28.980 --> 2:27:30.980]  And riding monkey on the wall
[2:27:30.980 --> 2:27:32.980]  Caught in the act doing it
[2:27:32.980 --> 2:27:34.980]  I mean, this is happening everywhere
[2:27:34.980 --> 2:27:36.980]  Almost all these attacks are staged
[2:27:36.980 --> 2:27:39.980]  Yeah, there it is, WGCL
[2:27:39.980 --> 2:27:41.980]  Yes, and he included MAGA in that
[2:27:41.980 --> 2:27:44.980]  It was all about MAGA, just like Justy Smallin
[2:27:44.980 --> 2:27:46.980]  And it's all about destroying Trump
[2:27:46.980 --> 2:27:48.980]  And the media lets it happen
[2:27:48.980 --> 2:27:50.980]  That story barely got off the page
[2:27:50.980 --> 2:27:54.980]  Can you imagine if that was a true story
[2:27:54.980 --> 2:27:56.980]  And MAGA guys really did that?
[2:27:56.980 --> 2:27:58.980]  You'd never hear the end of it
[2:27:58.980 --> 2:28:00.980]  That mentally ill handicapped kid
[2:28:00.980 --> 2:28:03.980]  Who was wearing a MAGA hat and they kidnapped him
[2:28:03.980 --> 2:28:05.980]  And they tied him up and they cut him
[2:28:05.980 --> 2:28:07.980]  They cut his scalp and they were screaming at him
[2:28:07.980 --> 2:28:10.980]  The girl who did that, one of the girls got away with probation
[2:28:10.980 --> 2:28:13.980]  No charges, proud boys, 15 years for defending themselves
[2:28:13.980 --> 2:28:17.980]  Torture, a mentally handicapped MAGA supporter
[2:28:17.980 --> 2:28:18.980]  Ah, probation
[2:28:18.980 --> 2:28:21.980]  So we have to remember that we're not just up against Antifa
[2:28:21.980 --> 2:28:24.980]  They're just the useful idiots for their henchmen
[2:28:24.980 --> 2:28:28.980]  We're up against Antifa
[2:28:55.980 --> 2:28:56.980]  Listen to me
[2:28:56.980 --> 2:28:58.980]  You don't know me and we'll never meet
[2:28:58.980 --> 2:29:00.980]  I had a problem like you once
[2:29:00.980 --> 2:29:02.980]  I drank and used to party a little too much
[2:29:02.980 --> 2:29:06.980]  Till it got out of control and almost ruined my life
[2:29:06.980 --> 2:29:09.980]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[2:29:09.980 --> 2:29:11.980]  Before it totally destroyed me
[2:29:11.980 --> 2:29:14.980]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem
[2:29:14.980 --> 2:29:16.980]  And you know you can't do it alone
[2:29:16.980 --> 2:29:19.980]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors
[2:29:19.980 --> 2:29:22.980]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program
[2:29:22.980 --> 2:29:24.980]  To replace your old habits with new habits
[2:29:24.980 --> 2:29:26.980]  And totally change your life
[2:29:26.980 --> 2:29:29.980]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance
[2:29:29.980 --> 2:29:31.980]  The entire program may be covered
[2:29:31.980 --> 2:29:33.980]  Fix your problem right now
[2:29:33.980 --> 2:29:35.980]  Before it gets any worse
[2:29:35.980 --> 2:29:36.980]  Get clean
[2:29:36.980 --> 2:29:54.980]  Call now and learn more
[2:29:54.980 --> 2:29:57.980]  We have entered a great time of change
[2:29:57.980 --> 2:30:00.980]  The social engineers who serve Satan
[2:30:00.980 --> 2:30:02.980]  Who are in control of this planet
[2:30:02.980 --> 2:30:06.980]  Believe that if they can organize enough crises that they control
[2:30:06.980 --> 2:30:09.980]  They can terrorize the planet into accepting
[2:30:09.980 --> 2:30:11.980]  A tyrannical corporate world government
[2:30:11.980 --> 2:30:13.980]  Known as a technocracy in their own words
[2:30:13.980 --> 2:30:15.980]  That will manage and control
[2:30:15.980 --> 2:30:18.980]  And manipulate every facet of our lives
[2:30:18.980 --> 2:30:21.980]  At first, they can do just a few basic things to do
[2:30:21.980 --> 2:30:23.980]  Don't support Trump
[2:30:23.980 --> 2:30:24.980]  Don't promote Alex Jones
[2:30:24.980 --> 2:30:26.980]  And once you've submitted to that
[2:30:26.980 --> 2:30:28.980]  Well, don't say mother and father
[2:30:28.980 --> 2:30:30.980]  Well, let us sterilize your children
[2:30:30.980 --> 2:30:32.980]  Take these forced inoculations
[2:30:32.980 --> 2:30:34.980]  And here, take this Prozac pill
[2:30:34.980 --> 2:30:36.980]  And here, smoke this weaponized marijuana
[2:30:36.980 --> 2:30:38.980]  Oh, don't be a Christian
[2:30:38.980 --> 2:30:40.980]  This is truly the market to be system
[2:30:40.980 --> 2:30:42.980]  And we're on air right now
[2:30:42.980 --> 2:30:43.980]  Covering it
[2:30:43.980 --> 2:30:45.980]  And you're awake, you're involved, you're engaged
[2:30:45.980 --> 2:30:46.980]  You're an ambassador of truth
[2:30:46.980 --> 2:30:47.980]  So I'm begging you
[2:30:47.980 --> 2:30:49.980]  For yourself and myself and my family
[2:30:49.980 --> 2:30:50.980]  And your family
[2:30:50.980 --> 2:30:51.980]  Spread the word about Infowars.com
[2:30:51.980 --> 2:31:20.980]  The live shows right now
[2:31:21.980 --> 2:31:22.980]  It's got the hyaluronic acid
[2:31:22.980 --> 2:31:24.980]  It's got the steric acid
[2:31:24.980 --> 2:31:26.980]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil
[2:31:26.980 --> 2:31:29.980]  It's got the nano silver coconut oil
[2:31:29.980 --> 2:31:30.980]  And so much more
[2:31:30.980 --> 2:31:31.980]  It's in two sizes
[2:31:31.980 --> 2:31:33.980]  Super silver skin cream
[2:31:33.980 --> 2:31:34.980]  In 3.4 ounce
[2:31:34.980 --> 2:31:35.980]  And in the smaller one
[2:31:35.980 --> 2:31:37.980]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere
[2:31:37.980 --> 2:31:39.980]  And you're certainly not going to find it at this price
[2:31:39.980 --> 2:31:41.980]  And it funds the Infowars
[2:31:41.980 --> 2:31:43.980]  At InfowarsLife.com
[2:31:43.980 --> 2:31:46.980]  Get your super silver skin cream today
[2:31:46.980 --> 2:31:49.980]  We can only run this special for another week or so
[2:31:49.980 --> 2:31:53.980]  As of taping this September 10th
[2:31:53.980 --> 2:31:56.980]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn
[2:31:56.980 --> 2:31:58.980]  That Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant
[2:31:58.980 --> 2:32:00.980]  Governmental blackmail ring
[2:32:00.980 --> 2:32:02.980]  Using pedophilia
[2:32:02.980 --> 2:32:04.980]  I was the first to warn of human animal
[2:32:04.980 --> 2:32:06.980]  Hybrids and organ harvesting
[2:32:06.980 --> 2:32:08.980]  I was the first to begin to warn
[2:32:08.980 --> 2:32:10.980]  That babies were being kept alive
[2:32:10.980 --> 2:32:11.980]  After they were born
[2:32:11.980 --> 2:32:14.980]  For their organs to be harvested
[2:32:14.980 --> 2:32:15.980]  I was the first to warn you
[2:32:15.980 --> 2:32:16.980]  Along with Paul Watson
[2:32:16.980 --> 2:32:19.980]  At Infowars.com
[2:32:19.980 --> 2:32:20.980]  15 years ago that Google
[2:32:20.980 --> 2:32:22.980]  Was using microphones and hidden cameras
[2:32:22.980 --> 2:32:24.980]  To record everything you do
[2:32:24.980 --> 2:32:28.980]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues
[2:32:28.980 --> 2:32:30.980]  Like the Federal Reserve being private
[2:32:30.980 --> 2:32:31.980]  Run for profit
[2:32:31.980 --> 2:32:33.980]  Trying to control our economy
[2:32:33.980 --> 2:32:34.980]  That our government in Hollywood
[2:32:34.980 --> 2:32:36.980]  Have been taken over by the Communist Chinese
[2:32:36.980 --> 2:32:38.980]  On every one of these issues
[2:32:38.980 --> 2:32:39.980]  And many others
[2:32:39.980 --> 2:32:40.980]  We've been dead on
[2:32:40.980 --> 2:32:43.980]  And we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale
[2:32:43.980 --> 2:32:44.980]  That's why the globalists
[2:32:44.980 --> 2:32:46.980]  Have shut us down
[2:32:46.980 --> 2:32:48.980]  And that's why you are more critical
[2:32:48.980 --> 2:32:50.980]  Than ever to support the Info War
[2:32:50.980 --> 2:32:51.980]  Please support the Info War
[2:32:51.980 --> 2:33:18.980]  Wherever you can
[2:33:18.980 --> 2:33:23.980]  Okay Matt Bracken
[2:33:23.980 --> 2:33:25.980]  From Austin, Texas
[2:33:25.980 --> 2:33:27.980]  Broadcasting worldwide
[2:33:27.980 --> 2:33:33.980]  From the Infowars.com studios
[2:33:33.980 --> 2:33:35.980]  Matt Bracken served in the Middle East
[2:33:35.980 --> 2:33:36.980]  He's from a Navy SEAL
[2:33:36.980 --> 2:33:37.980]  A really smart fellow
[2:33:37.980 --> 2:33:39.980]  I want to get his take
[2:33:39.980 --> 2:33:41.980]  Next hour on what's happening
[2:33:41.980 --> 2:33:42.980]  Over in Iran
[2:33:42.980 --> 2:33:44.980]  It's a very complex situation
[2:33:44.980 --> 2:33:47.980]  That obviously lead to a major world war
[2:33:47.980 --> 2:33:49.980]  I said I'd open the phones up
[2:33:49.980 --> 2:33:51.980]  I'm going to host 15 minutes to the next hour
[2:33:51.980 --> 2:33:52.980]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now
[2:33:52.980 --> 2:33:54.980]  I mean by the end of this segment
[2:33:54.980 --> 2:33:56.980]  A toll free number to join us on
[2:33:56.980 --> 2:33:57.980]  The world war situation
[2:33:57.980 --> 2:33:58.980]  What you think is happening
[2:33:58.980 --> 2:34:00.980]  What you think Trump should do
[2:34:00.980 --> 2:34:01.980]  Your take on it
[2:34:01.980 --> 2:34:03.980]  877-789-ALEX
[2:34:03.980 --> 2:34:05.980]  877-789-2539
[2:34:05.980 --> 2:34:07.980]  That's 877-789-ALEX
[2:34:07.980 --> 2:34:10.980]  On that topic
[2:34:10.980 --> 2:34:11.980]  Specifically
[2:34:11.980 --> 2:34:14.980]  China warns Trump not to believe
[2:34:14.980 --> 2:34:16.980]  Warhawk conspiracy theories
[2:34:16.980 --> 2:34:19.980]  Iran was behind attack on Saudi Arabia
[2:34:19.980 --> 2:34:20.980]  Very interesting story
[2:34:20.980 --> 2:34:24.980]  By Paul Joseph Watson at NewsWars.com
[2:34:24.980 --> 2:34:26.980]  Cautions that revenge attack on Iran
[2:34:26.980 --> 2:34:28.980]  Could cause Middle East to spiral
[2:34:28.980 --> 2:34:29.980]  Out of control
[2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:30.980]  Close quote
[2:34:30.980 --> 2:34:32.980]  You know I would normally agree with that
[2:34:32.980 --> 2:34:34.980]  And I'm not saying I'm for a wider war
[2:34:34.980 --> 2:34:36.980]  But Iran grabbed another ship
[2:34:36.980 --> 2:34:38.980]  They grabbed dozens of ships
[2:34:38.980 --> 2:34:40.980]  And when they grabbed ships
[2:34:40.980 --> 2:34:41.980]  A lot of people call in and say
[2:34:41.980 --> 2:34:42.980]  Alex is a conspiracy
[2:34:42.980 --> 2:34:44.980]  They're not doing anything
[2:34:44.980 --> 2:34:47.980]  The neocons, they're warmongers
[2:34:47.980 --> 2:34:52.980]  Iran admits to grabbing a bunch of ships
[2:34:52.980 --> 2:34:54.980]  They're going out of their side
[2:34:54.980 --> 2:34:55.980]  Of the Strait of Hormuz
[2:34:55.980 --> 2:34:56.980]  Out of their territorial waters
[2:34:56.980 --> 2:34:58.980]  Into Saudi Arabia's
[2:34:58.980 --> 2:35:02.980]  They're threatening to attack all these countries
[2:35:02.980 --> 2:35:05.980]  They're funding the Shi'at rebels in Yemen
[2:35:05.980 --> 2:35:07.980]  That now have high tech cruise missiles
[2:35:07.980 --> 2:35:09.980]  That did blow up these oil refineries
[2:35:09.980 --> 2:35:11.980]  We can show you the satellite, the drone footage
[2:35:11.980 --> 2:35:13.980]  We can show you the burning refineries
[2:35:13.980 --> 2:35:14.980]  With that on screen
[2:35:14.980 --> 2:35:17.980]  So all I'm saying is
[2:35:17.980 --> 2:35:20.980]  People better pull back
[2:35:20.980 --> 2:35:22.980]  And they better really think about
[2:35:22.980 --> 2:35:23.980]  The big picture
[2:35:23.980 --> 2:35:26.980]  That you have shadow diplomacy by Obama
[2:35:26.980 --> 2:35:27.980]  And by Hillary
[2:35:27.980 --> 2:35:30.980]  And by former Secretary of State
[2:35:30.980 --> 2:35:33.980]  John Kerry admittedly advising Iran
[2:35:33.980 --> 2:35:34.980]  How to embarrass Trump
[2:35:34.980 --> 2:35:36.980]  And how to sabotage our economy
[2:35:36.980 --> 2:35:38.980]  And this couldn't be a better way to do it
[2:35:38.980 --> 2:35:40.980]  So we're caught between the Shi'i
[2:35:40.980 --> 2:35:41.980]  And Sunni Civil War
[2:35:41.980 --> 2:35:44.980]  The war's real
[2:35:44.980 --> 2:35:45.980]  Now it's perfect though
[2:35:45.980 --> 2:35:47.980]  I get why people are asking questions
[2:35:47.980 --> 2:35:49.980]  Bolton leaves last week
[2:35:49.980 --> 2:35:50.980]  Israel's about to have a selection
[2:35:50.980 --> 2:35:51.980]  Netanyahu's in trouble
[2:35:51.980 --> 2:35:52.980]  And all of a sudden
[2:35:52.980 --> 2:35:54.980]  These oil refineries blow up
[2:35:54.980 --> 2:35:57.980]  The Yemenis rebels have taken responsibility
[2:35:57.980 --> 2:35:59.980]  They've fired missiles before
[2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:02.980]  They're officially taking responsibility
[2:36:02.980 --> 2:36:06.980]  Iran's denying it
[2:36:06.980 --> 2:36:08.980]  This is half of Saudi Arabia's oil production
[2:36:08.980 --> 2:36:11.980]  One more attack like this
[2:36:11.980 --> 2:36:14.980]  And we can see it go well above $100 a barrel
[2:36:14.980 --> 2:36:17.980]  This could kill the U.S. recovery
[2:36:17.980 --> 2:36:19.980]  I believe this is staged
[2:36:19.980 --> 2:36:22.980]  By deep state globalists working with Iran
[2:36:22.980 --> 2:36:25.980]  To try to trick Trump into a war
[2:36:25.980 --> 2:36:26.980]  And into strikes
[2:36:26.980 --> 2:36:28.980]  And they've got something really big planned
[2:36:28.980 --> 2:36:29.980]  To plunge the global economy
[2:36:29.980 --> 2:36:31.980]  This is a super triple cross
[2:36:31.980 --> 2:36:32.980]  And so I agree with Rand Paul
[2:36:32.980 --> 2:36:34.980]  And Ron Paul, we shouldn't do it
[2:36:34.980 --> 2:36:36.980]  But Ron Paul's got an article out
[2:36:36.980 --> 2:36:38.980]  It's on infowars.com
[2:36:38.980 --> 2:36:40.980]  We respect the former congressman
[2:36:40.980 --> 2:36:42.980]  Saying it probably staged
[2:36:42.980 --> 2:36:44.980]  Well, I mean, I remember when we first reported
[2:36:44.980 --> 2:36:46.980]  That the chemical attacks a few years ago were staged
[2:36:46.980 --> 2:36:48.980]  It was being reported by the U.N. and others
[2:36:48.980 --> 2:36:50.980]  It just didn't get reported here
[2:36:50.980 --> 2:36:51.980]  And the CIA came out and said
[2:36:51.980 --> 2:36:53.980]  I need to be shut down
[2:36:53.980 --> 2:36:56.980]  Because I'm putting out false narratives
[2:36:56.980 --> 2:36:58.980]  I'm just trying to figure out what's going on
[2:36:58.980 --> 2:37:00.980]  It turned out those chemical attacks were staged
[2:37:00.980 --> 2:37:02.980]  But Ron Paul and people were saying
[2:37:02.980 --> 2:37:04.980]  Oh, this could be totally staged
[2:37:04.980 --> 2:37:06.980]  By Saudi Arabia or by Israel
[2:37:06.980 --> 2:37:09.980]  And I'm not saying those countries couldn't stage something
[2:37:09.980 --> 2:37:12.980]  But Iran is really grabbing ships
[2:37:12.980 --> 2:37:13.980]  Iran is really funding rebels
[2:37:13.980 --> 2:37:15.980]  Iran's really giving them missiles
[2:37:15.980 --> 2:37:18.980]  These refineries really got blown up
[2:37:18.980 --> 2:37:20.980]  Because Iran is playing dirty
[2:37:20.980 --> 2:37:22.980]  Working with the deep state which we know
[2:37:22.980 --> 2:37:24.980]  And the deep state's been advising them
[2:37:24.980 --> 2:37:26.980]  To maneuver Trump into an embarrassing event
[2:37:26.980 --> 2:37:29.980]  That'll make the Bay of Pigs invasion
[2:37:29.980 --> 2:37:32.980]  Of Cuba look like child's play
[2:37:32.980 --> 2:37:35.980]  Secretary Pompeo says we call on all nations
[2:37:35.980 --> 2:37:36.980]  To condemn
[2:37:36.980 --> 2:37:38.980]  Publicly and unequivocally condemn
[2:37:38.980 --> 2:37:39.980]  Iran's attacks
[2:37:39.980 --> 2:37:41.980]  The United States will work with our partners
[2:37:41.980 --> 2:37:43.980]  And allies to ensure that energy markets remain
[2:37:43.980 --> 2:37:44.980]  Well supplied
[2:37:44.980 --> 2:37:47.980]  And Iran has held accountable for its aggression
[2:37:47.980 --> 2:37:52.980]  So Pompeo is saying after getting rid of Bolton
[2:37:52.980 --> 2:37:54.980]  And we now learn they disagree
[2:37:54.980 --> 2:37:57.980]  Pompeo wasn't this big hawk
[2:37:57.980 --> 2:38:00.980]  He was pieced to his strength though
[2:38:00.980 --> 2:38:02.980]  That Pompeo and Trump do think it's Iran
[2:38:02.980 --> 2:38:05.980]  Because the rebels are Iran run
[2:38:05.980 --> 2:38:07.980]  They've had a bunch of not just cruise missiles
[2:38:07.980 --> 2:38:09.980]  That fly above the ground 100 feet
[2:38:09.980 --> 2:38:10.980]  200 feet
[2:38:10.980 --> 2:38:12.980]  They've had ICBMs
[2:38:12.980 --> 2:38:14.980]  That go up into space
[2:38:14.980 --> 2:38:17.980]  And come back down
[2:38:17.980 --> 2:38:19.980]  On top of Riyadh
[2:38:19.980 --> 2:38:21.980]  They've shot them down with their iron dome systems
[2:38:21.980 --> 2:38:22.980]  And others
[2:38:22.980 --> 2:38:24.980]  They've gotten from the US and Israel
[2:38:24.980 --> 2:38:26.980]  But
[2:38:26.980 --> 2:38:29.980]  This is not either Iran staged it
[2:38:29.980 --> 2:38:31.980]  Or the West staged it
[2:38:31.980 --> 2:38:33.980]  This is
[2:38:33.980 --> 2:38:35.980]  Iran emboldened by the deep state
[2:38:35.980 --> 2:38:37.980]  Thinking Trump can be manipulated
[2:38:37.980 --> 2:38:39.980]  And there's some really dirty stuff going on
[2:38:39.980 --> 2:38:42.980]  And Iran was used by the deep state to discredit Jimmy Carter
[2:38:42.980 --> 2:38:45.980]  Where I was no fan of
[2:38:45.980 --> 2:38:46.980]  But that went on before
[2:38:46.980 --> 2:38:49.980]  So folks better be aware of that
[2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:51.980]  And understand this is a very serious time to be alive
[2:38:51.980 --> 2:38:55.980]  China warns Trump not to believe war hawk conspiracy theories
[2:38:55.980 --> 2:38:59.980]  Tulsi Gabbards rips Trump on Iran threats
[2:38:59.980 --> 2:39:02.980]  Acting like Saudi Arabia's bitch is not America first
[2:39:02.980 --> 2:39:04.980]  Well that's just a cheap shot
[2:39:04.980 --> 2:39:06.980]  You know like people cussing on TV
[2:39:06.980 --> 2:39:07.980]  Like they do on CNN
[2:39:07.980 --> 2:39:09.980]  Talking about asshole countries
[2:39:09.980 --> 2:39:11.980]  I mean we're not acting like Saudi Arabia's bitch
[2:39:11.980 --> 2:39:14.980]  Saudi Arabia just had two of its biggest wall refineries blown up
[2:39:14.980 --> 2:39:16.980]  We just made Saudi Arabia come to heal
[2:39:16.980 --> 2:39:19.980]  And stop funding ISIS and Al Qaeda
[2:39:22.980 --> 2:39:24.980]  Meanwhile
[2:39:24.980 --> 2:39:27.980]  New Montreal city pool will have just one changing room
[2:39:27.980 --> 2:39:29.980]  And it will be gender neutral
[2:39:29.980 --> 2:39:32.980]  That's right, your kids will be with men and women
[2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:34.980]  Chandy Hill University normalizes pedophilia
[2:39:34.980 --> 2:39:37.980]  Sexual orientation, go look at it for yourself
[2:39:37.980 --> 2:39:39.980]  Those that don't like it are bad
[2:39:39.980 --> 2:39:42.980]  Archaeologists uncover world's largest child sacrifice site
[2:39:42.980 --> 2:39:44.980]  In coastal Peru, yep
[2:39:44.980 --> 2:39:45.980]  I guess it's all back to that again
[2:39:45.980 --> 2:39:47.980]  The Catholic case for communism
[2:39:47.980 --> 2:39:49.980]  Major Catholic publication calls
[2:39:49.980 --> 2:39:51.980]  For communism, American magazine
[2:39:51.980 --> 2:39:53.980]  Unbelievable, killed 200 million people
[2:39:53.980 --> 2:39:56.980]  And so much more
[2:39:56.980 --> 2:39:59.980]  AOC says Miami will disappear in a few years
[2:39:59.980 --> 2:40:00.980]  The world's not ending in 12
[2:40:00.980 --> 2:40:02.980]  It's ending in two years
[2:40:02.980 --> 2:40:04.980]  If we don't pay Al Gore and worth Rothschild
[2:40:04.980 --> 2:40:06.980]  All those carbon taxes
[2:40:07.980 --> 2:40:10.980]  Pretty amazing to see all of that
[2:40:10.980 --> 2:40:12.980]  Unfolding
[2:40:12.980 --> 2:40:15.980]  That's just some of what we need to cover
[2:40:15.980 --> 2:40:19.980]  We're gonna go to break and come back with KC, Sean, David, Doyle
[2:40:19.980 --> 2:40:21.980]  And others on the other side
[2:40:21.980 --> 2:40:24.980]  Of this quick break, and then we're gonna take calls
[2:40:24.980 --> 2:40:25.980]  I guess I can take more than six or seven
[2:40:25.980 --> 2:40:26.980]  I have this thing now
[2:40:26.980 --> 2:40:28.980]  If I can only take two segments of calls
[2:40:28.980 --> 2:40:30.980]  I still look six or seven callers on
[2:40:30.980 --> 2:40:31.980]  I'm gonna host 15 minutes to the next hour
[2:40:31.980 --> 2:40:32.980]  So let's get about 10 on there
[2:40:32.980 --> 2:40:35.980]  I should be able to get to all of those folks
[2:40:35.980 --> 2:40:37.980]  toll free number 877-789 Alex
[2:40:37.980 --> 2:40:40.980]  877-789-2539
[2:40:40.980 --> 2:40:43.980]  On this situation that we see unfolding
[2:40:43.980 --> 2:40:45.980]  U.S. prepares to strike
[2:40:45.980 --> 2:40:49.980]  Iran is the Middle East braces for World War III
[2:40:49.980 --> 2:40:51.980]  Gold hit $100 Pompeo
[2:40:51.980 --> 2:40:53.980]  Blames Iran for unprecedented drone attack
[2:40:53.980 --> 2:40:58.980]  On the crippled largest oil processing facility
[2:40:58.980 --> 2:41:02.980]  Rand Paul warns against needless escalation of war
[2:41:02.980 --> 2:41:03.980]  So there you go
[2:41:03.980 --> 2:41:07.980]  I agree, we don't need to escalate this, but
[2:41:07.980 --> 2:41:11.980]  The rebels took credit
[2:41:11.980 --> 2:41:14.980]  And we don't see any evidence that that's a staged event
[2:41:14.980 --> 2:41:17.980]  So what is Iran doing while they've been emboldened?
[2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:19.980]  So it is a false flag of a type
[2:41:19.980 --> 2:41:21.980]  Because the deep state is over there advising them
[2:41:21.980 --> 2:41:23.980]  That they can set Trump up
[2:41:23.980 --> 2:41:25.980]  Very dangerous position
[2:41:25.980 --> 2:41:28.980]  Same thing they tried on Kennedy with the bad pigs
[2:41:28.980 --> 2:41:29.980]  Well that didn't work
[2:41:29.980 --> 2:41:30.980]  You know what they did to Kennedy in the end
[2:41:30.980 --> 2:41:33.980]  And Trump like Kennedy has definitely upset the power structure
[2:41:33.980 --> 2:41:36.980]  We're gonna go to break him right back with your calls
[2:41:36.980 --> 2:41:38.980]  Please remember that the globalists are working around the clock
[2:41:38.980 --> 2:41:39.980]  To shut us down
[2:41:39.980 --> 2:41:42.980]  There's been attempts to take down infowarstore.com
[2:41:42.980 --> 2:41:45.980]  And infowarst.com today with giant denial of service attacks
[2:41:45.980 --> 2:41:47.980]  I mean 10 million people
[2:41:47.980 --> 2:41:50.980]  Bots hitting the site every minute
[2:41:50.980 --> 2:41:52.980]  But we stayed up and the sites are secure
[2:41:52.980 --> 2:41:54.980]  infowarstore.com
[2:41:54.980 --> 2:41:56.980]  We have some huge specials that have to end this week

[2:42:10.980 --> 2:42:13.980]  We're gonna have to end the other really big specials

[2:42:48.980 --> 2:42:51.980]  But we're about to sell out of ultimate female force
[2:42:51.980 --> 2:42:53.980]  So we have to end that special
[2:42:53.980 --> 2:42:56.980]  I know most of you realize this but I'm going to say it again very very clearly
[2:42:56.980 --> 2:43:01.980]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at info wars
[2:43:01.980 --> 2:43:05.980]  And we are the individuals that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan
[2:43:05.980 --> 2:43:07.980]  And we know how to take them down
[2:43:07.980 --> 2:43:09.980]  That's why they're so upset
[2:43:09.980 --> 2:43:11.980]  And so far we've come together
[2:43:11.980 --> 2:43:14.980]  You know even if we were losing we'd all still keep fighting on
[2:43:14.980 --> 2:43:18.980]  Because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces
[2:43:18.980 --> 2:43:21.980]  Of the new world order who've really taken the mask off
[2:43:21.980 --> 2:43:23.980]  The lines in the sand for everybody now
[2:43:23.980 --> 2:43:26.980]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption
[2:43:26.980 --> 2:43:29.980]  And to stand with God and to stand with the unborn
[2:43:29.980 --> 2:43:32.980]  So I just want to take time out again to salute the audience

[2:45:21.980 --> 2:45:24.980]  And that we are just mortal flawed human beings
[2:45:24.980 --> 2:45:27.980]  That need to seek God's countenance
[2:45:27.980 --> 2:45:30.980]  God's discernment and to pray for peace
[2:45:30.980 --> 2:45:32.980]  And to pray for transparency
[2:45:32.980 --> 2:45:35.980]  And to pray that the very twisted evil forces on this planet
[2:45:35.980 --> 2:45:37.980]  Trying to start a world war
[2:45:37.980 --> 2:45:41.980]  Will be exposed to their attempts at creating even bigger global crisis
[2:45:41.980 --> 2:45:42.980]  Will be stopped
[2:45:42.980 --> 2:45:45.980]  Now we'll probably avert a new world war hopefully
[2:45:45.980 --> 2:45:49.980]  But it's already tilting towards a global depression
[2:45:49.980 --> 2:45:51.980]  Because of energy crisis
[2:45:51.980 --> 2:45:54.980]  We're covering it all live on the radio at infoworks.com
[2:45:54.980 --> 2:45:58.980]  Super silver wound gel is a private label
[2:45:58.980 --> 2:46:00.980]  From the top company in the US
[2:46:00.980 --> 2:46:03.980]  That has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter
[2:46:03.980 --> 2:46:05.980]  And approved for that by the FDA
[2:46:05.980 --> 2:46:07.980]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it
[2:46:07.980 --> 2:46:09.980]  In the last two years it's been a best seller
[2:46:09.980 --> 2:46:13.980]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream
[2:46:13.980 --> 2:46:17.980]  That basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there
[2:46:17.980 --> 2:46:21.980]  At a lower price with their patented silver salt technology in it
[2:46:21.980 --> 2:46:23.980]  It's got the hyaluronic acid
[2:46:23.980 --> 2:46:25.980]  It's got the steric acid
[2:46:25.980 --> 2:46:27.980]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil
[2:46:27.980 --> 2:46:31.980]  It's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more
[2:46:31.980 --> 2:46:32.980]  It's in two sizes
[2:46:32.980 --> 2:46:35.980]  Super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce
[2:46:35.980 --> 2:46:36.980]  And in the smaller one
[2:46:36.980 --> 2:46:38.980]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere
[2:46:38.980 --> 2:46:40.980]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price
[2:46:40.980 --> 2:46:44.980]  And it funds the info war at infowarslife.com
[2:46:44.980 --> 2:46:47.980]  Get your super silver skin cream today
[2:46:47.980 --> 2:46:50.980]  We can only run this special for another week or so
[2:46:50.980 --> 2:47:12.980]  As of taping this September 10th
[2:47:20.980 --> 2:47:24.980]  In the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas
[2:47:24.980 --> 2:47:26.980]  Transmitting worldwide
[2:47:26.980 --> 2:47:28.980]  It's Alex Jones
[2:47:28.980 --> 2:47:31.980]  If you are receiving this transmission
[2:47:31.980 --> 2:48:00.980]  You are the resistance
[2:48:00.980 --> 2:48:03.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide
[2:48:03.980 --> 2:48:05.980]  I am your host Alex Jones
[2:48:05.980 --> 2:48:07.980]  We're on your phone calls right now
[2:48:07.980 --> 2:48:08.980]  But just before the break
[2:48:08.980 --> 2:48:11.980]  I mentioned a lot of stuff is on major sale
[2:48:11.980 --> 2:48:12.980]  50% off right now
[2:48:12.980 --> 2:48:14.980]  And I just haven't all week been telling you
[2:48:14.980 --> 2:48:15.980]  Last week what it is
[2:48:15.980 --> 2:48:17.980]  Because these specials have to end this week
[2:48:17.980 --> 2:48:19.980]  We have Myco ZX
[2:48:19.980 --> 2:48:20.980]  That is the next level probiotic
[2:48:20.980 --> 2:48:22.980]  That doesn't just give you the good bacteria in the gut
[2:48:22.980 --> 2:48:24.980]  That's what our fluorolife does
[2:48:24.980 --> 2:48:25.980]  Excellent probiotic
[2:48:25.980 --> 2:48:28.980]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida
[2:48:28.980 --> 2:48:30.980]  So the good bacteria can take over
[2:48:30.980 --> 2:48:32.980]  You're not supposed to have yeast and mold and candida in your gut
[2:48:32.980 --> 2:48:34.980]  And so many people have allergies and problems
[2:48:34.980 --> 2:48:36.980]  Because of the yeast and mold in the gut
[2:48:36.980 --> 2:48:38.980]  Myco ZX is $19.95
[2:48:38.980 --> 2:48:41.980]  It cost us that to make
[2:48:41.980 --> 2:48:44.980]  People are saying, why are you doing the biggest sales ever?
[2:48:44.980 --> 2:48:46.980]  I explain this to everybody
[2:48:46.980 --> 2:48:48.980]  That we're selling out of all the product
[2:48:48.980 --> 2:48:50.980]  Just to run the operation
[2:48:50.980 --> 2:48:52.980]  And then we won't have money to buy products in the future
[2:48:52.980 --> 2:48:53.980]  I'm not kidding
[2:48:53.980 --> 2:48:56.980]  And I personally am going to relaunch the sales department
[2:48:56.980 --> 2:48:57.980]  Myself
[2:48:57.980 --> 2:48:58.980]  I have a bunch of sponsors
[2:48:58.980 --> 2:48:59.980]  Want to come back on
[2:48:59.980 --> 2:49:00.980]  I will do it myself
[2:49:00.980 --> 2:49:02.980]  I'm working 18 hours a day now
[2:49:02.980 --> 2:49:03.980]  It has to happen
[2:49:03.980 --> 2:49:04.980]  I'll do it, I'll do it all
[2:49:04.980 --> 2:49:05.980]  Don't worry
[2:49:05.980 --> 2:49:06.980]  So continuing
[2:49:06.980 --> 2:49:08.980]  Ultra 12 is an amazing
[2:49:08.980 --> 2:49:10.980]  Absolutely amazing, highest quality B12
[2:49:10.980 --> 2:49:11.980]  You're going to find anywhere
[2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:13.980]  It's the best you can get organic under the tongue
[2:49:13.980 --> 2:49:14.980]  It's incredible
[2:49:14.980 --> 2:49:15.980]  Change your whole life
[2:49:15.980 --> 2:49:16.980]  Want this type of energy?
[2:49:16.980 --> 2:49:17.980]  Take none of them B12
[2:49:17.980 --> 2:49:18.980]  I inject it every morning
[2:49:18.980 --> 2:49:20.980]  But it does your mitochondria is incredible
[2:49:20.980 --> 2:49:22.980]  Well, under the tongue is the next best
[2:49:22.980 --> 2:49:24.980]  Total gut health combo
[2:49:24.980 --> 2:49:25.980]  A $300 value
[2:49:25.980 --> 2:49:27.980]  75% off at cost
[2:49:27.980 --> 2:49:28.980]  You want total for your gut
[2:49:28.980 --> 2:49:29.980]  It's all there, eight products
[2:49:29.980 --> 2:49:30.980]  50% off brain force
[2:49:30.980 --> 2:49:31.980]  Plus when bought with chill force
[2:49:31.980 --> 2:49:32.980]  40% off chill force
[2:49:32.980 --> 2:49:33.980]  50% off hapies
[2:49:33.980 --> 2:49:35.980]  50% off ultimate bone broth
[2:49:35.980 --> 2:49:36.980]  Incredible, we're selling out of that
[2:49:36.980 --> 2:49:38.980]  50% off bodies, old Potomac formula
[2:49:38.980 --> 2:49:40.980]  60% off eight power power stack
[2:49:40.980 --> 2:49:42.980]  60% off Icarin for your liver and kidneys
[2:49:43.980 --> 2:49:44.980]  Okay
[2:49:45.980 --> 2:49:47.980]  But you know, people rather just
[2:49:47.980 --> 2:49:48.980]  Just rot and die
[2:49:48.980 --> 2:49:50.980]  And let the pedophiles take over
[2:49:50.980 --> 2:49:52.980]  I get it because there's an unconsciousness
[2:49:52.980 --> 2:49:53.980]  A mass death
[2:49:53.980 --> 2:49:54.980]  Let me tell you, billions are going to die
[2:49:54.980 --> 2:49:56.980]  They're going to rape your children
[2:49:56.980 --> 2:49:57.980]  And they're going to have nuclear war
[2:49:57.980 --> 2:49:58.980]  Because they want to kill everybody
[2:49:58.980 --> 2:49:59.980]  It's going to happen
[2:49:59.980 --> 2:50:00.980]  Down the road
[2:50:00.980 --> 2:50:02.980]  You know, I'm just trying to get as many people
[2:50:02.980 --> 2:50:03.980]  Right with God as I can
[2:50:03.980 --> 2:50:05.980]  But I see the death in everyone's eyes
[2:50:05.980 --> 2:50:07.980]  I see the no attention spans
[2:50:07.980 --> 2:50:09.980]  I see, I just see the failure
[2:50:09.980 --> 2:50:11.980]  And you know, it's just all part of cultural death
[2:50:11.980 --> 2:50:13.980]  It's just, it's very sad
[2:50:13.980 --> 2:50:15.980]  But a lot of us are still tuned into God
[2:50:15.980 --> 2:50:16.980]  And still have that fire in the eyes
[2:50:16.980 --> 2:50:19.980]  And we, it's up to us to fight these devils
[2:50:19.980 --> 2:50:22.980]  Now, the armies are lining up
[2:50:22.980 --> 2:50:24.980]  Around the world, ladies and gentlemen
[2:50:24.980 --> 2:50:26.980]  In proxy war
[2:50:26.980 --> 2:50:27.980]  We can talk about that for 10 hours
[2:50:27.980 --> 2:50:28.980]  I'm going to go to your calls
[2:50:28.980 --> 2:50:29.980]  But these are the times
[2:50:29.980 --> 2:50:31.980]  Massive World War started
[2:50:31.980 --> 2:50:33.980]  And we have such a bunch of
[2:50:33.980 --> 2:50:36.980]  American-hating boobies and idiots
[2:50:36.980 --> 2:50:38.980]  And we've had so many liars in government
[2:50:38.980 --> 2:50:39.980]  Lying about wars
[2:50:39.980 --> 2:50:40.980]  And lying about WMDs
[2:50:40.980 --> 2:50:42.980]  And lying about Gulf of Tonkens
[2:50:42.980 --> 2:50:44.980]  And false flags that now
[2:50:44.980 --> 2:50:46.980]  When Iran is working with the deep state
[2:50:46.980 --> 2:50:48.980]  And really staging these events
[2:50:48.980 --> 2:50:50.980]  The average American doesn't support the president
[2:50:50.980 --> 2:50:52.980]  And thinks he's making it up
[2:50:52.980 --> 2:50:53.980]  And I'm not for attacking Iran
[2:50:53.980 --> 2:50:56.980]  Because it's a setup
[2:50:56.980 --> 2:50:58.980]  With deep state like the Bay of Pigs
[2:50:58.980 --> 2:50:59.980]  Understand, because they're going to be
[2:50:59.980 --> 2:51:01.980]  Jones, the warmonger
[2:51:01.980 --> 2:51:03.980]  Works for Israel
[2:51:03.980 --> 2:51:05.980]  He supports an attack
[2:51:05.980 --> 2:51:07.980]  No, I didn't say that
[2:51:07.980 --> 2:51:09.980]  All the people running around saying
[2:51:09.980 --> 2:51:10.980]  It's a false flag or wrong
[2:51:10.980 --> 2:51:11.980]  Iran's behind it
[2:51:11.980 --> 2:51:12.980]  Because they think we're weak
[2:51:12.980 --> 2:51:13.980]  And they've been green-lighted
[2:51:13.980 --> 2:51:14.980]  By the globalists to do it
[2:51:14.980 --> 2:51:16.980]  And their whole deal
[2:51:16.980 --> 2:51:18.980]  It's about how the world divides
[2:51:18.980 --> 2:51:22.980]  China made the deal with Iran and Obama
[2:51:22.980 --> 2:51:24.980]  Trump is saying we're not China's bitch anymore
[2:51:24.980 --> 2:51:26.980]  On trade or military or oil
[2:51:26.980 --> 2:51:28.980]  And it's about us cutting them off
[2:51:28.980 --> 2:51:29.980]  And that's what this is
[2:51:29.980 --> 2:51:32.980]  A proxy war with China
[2:51:32.980 --> 2:51:34.980]  India just moved into Kashmir
[2:51:34.980 --> 2:51:36.980]  A month ago and moved up to the border
[2:51:36.980 --> 2:51:38.980]  And moved more troops in last week
[2:51:38.980 --> 2:51:40.980]  Up against the Chinese border
[2:51:40.980 --> 2:51:42.980]  We're blocking China's expansion
[2:51:42.980 --> 2:51:43.980]  The South China Sea
[2:51:43.980 --> 2:51:46.980]  They're at a stalemate in Hong Kong and Taiwan
[2:51:46.980 --> 2:51:49.980]  The Islamists are working with the EU
[2:51:49.980 --> 2:51:50.980]  Flooding Europe again
[2:51:50.980 --> 2:51:51.980]  They just removed the Italian leader
[2:51:51.980 --> 2:51:53.980]  That was blocking it
[2:51:53.980 --> 2:51:54.980]  This is all proxy wars
[2:51:54.980 --> 2:51:57.980]  Between the UN, with the EU, radical Islam
[2:51:57.980 --> 2:51:59.980]  The Chai Khoms, Iran and others
[2:51:59.980 --> 2:52:01.980]  Against the West and the United States
[2:52:01.980 --> 2:52:03.980]  And what's left of us
[2:52:03.980 --> 2:52:05.980]  And Hollywood's in there as their propagandists
[2:52:05.980 --> 2:52:07.980]  And the average American can't even get that
[2:52:07.980 --> 2:52:10.980]  So I'm not for striking Iran
[2:52:10.980 --> 2:52:12.980]  It's a super triple-cross deep state setup
[2:52:12.980 --> 2:52:15.980]  Run by Obama and to Kerry and others
[2:52:15.980 --> 2:52:17.980]  Just like Michael Moore bragged three years ago
[2:52:17.980 --> 2:52:19.980]  They'd do with Iran
[2:52:19.980 --> 2:52:21.980]  This is the scum we're dealing with
[2:52:21.980 --> 2:52:23.980]  Now that's what's really happening
[2:52:23.980 --> 2:52:24.980]  But it's a real attack
[2:52:24.980 --> 2:52:26.980]  And the ship they grabbed today is real
[2:52:26.980 --> 2:52:28.980]  They admit they grabbed it
[2:52:28.980 --> 2:52:31.980]  So we're in a war with China right now
[2:52:31.980 --> 2:52:35.980]  And the average American doesn't even give a hell
[2:52:35.980 --> 2:52:38.980]  Because people have been put in trance states
[2:52:38.980 --> 2:52:41.980]  When you're shown hundreds of thousands of simulated murders
[2:52:41.980 --> 2:52:43.980]  And when you play shoot-em-up video games
[2:52:43.980 --> 2:52:44.980]  You don't take real stuff anymore
[2:52:44.980 --> 2:52:46.980]  When you drive by and see a guy with his head cut off
[2:52:46.980 --> 2:52:47.980]  In a wreck
[2:52:47.980 --> 2:52:49.980]  Oh, I've seen that before on TV
[2:52:49.980 --> 2:52:53.980]  And it desensitizes you where you can't operate anymore
[2:52:53.980 --> 2:52:56.980]  But the world is on fire right now
[2:52:56.980 --> 2:52:58.980]  Literally and figuratively
[2:52:58.980 --> 2:53:00.980]  And there's enemies inside our government
[2:53:00.980 --> 2:53:02.980]  And the Federal Reserve trying to drive down
[2:53:02.980 --> 2:53:05.980]  Our economy right now
[2:53:05.980 --> 2:53:08.980]  And Trump looks like he might be taking the bait
[2:53:08.980 --> 2:53:11.980]  But not in a neocon false flag
[2:53:11.980 --> 2:53:14.980]  It's a globalist false flag through Iran
[2:53:14.980 --> 2:53:15.980]  At the highest levels
[2:53:15.980 --> 2:53:16.980]  That's my analysis
[2:53:16.980 --> 2:53:17.980]  What do you think?
[2:53:17.980 --> 2:53:22.980]  Chris, Ryan, Doyle, David, Duncan, Jim, Casey
[2:53:22.980 --> 2:53:25.980]  We're gonna go to all of your calls
[2:53:28.980 --> 2:53:30.980]  Chris in Tennessee, you're on the air
[2:53:30.980 --> 2:53:31.980]  Go ahead
[2:53:32.980 --> 2:53:34.980]  How's it going, Alex? In the morning?
[2:53:34.980 --> 2:53:36.980]  Yes, sir, it's just a crazy world
[2:53:36.980 --> 2:53:38.980]  What do you think about what I just said?
[2:53:38.980 --> 2:53:39.980]  What's your view?
[2:53:39.980 --> 2:53:43.980]  Well, first, let me plug Brain Force real quick
[2:53:43.980 --> 2:53:46.980]  Cheaper and better than Joe Rogan's Alpha Brain
[2:53:46.980 --> 2:53:47.980]  Love that stuff
[2:53:47.980 --> 2:53:50.980]  But I don't know if you listened to No Agenda at all
[2:53:50.980 --> 2:53:52.980]  With Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak
[2:53:52.980 --> 2:53:55.980]  But they raised an interesting point
[2:53:55.980 --> 2:53:59.980]  In the last episode about the Iran supposedly
[2:53:59.980 --> 2:54:02.980]  Bombing the oil facilities with drones
[2:54:02.980 --> 2:54:09.980]  How does a swarm of drones make it 500 miles undetected?
[2:54:09.980 --> 2:54:11.980]  I'm sorry, Mattia was cutting out
[2:54:11.980 --> 2:54:12.980]  I heard the part
[2:54:12.980 --> 2:54:15.980]  I've had Adam Curry on, he's a great guy
[2:54:15.980 --> 2:54:18.980]  Then his supporters all got mad at him coming on
[2:54:18.980 --> 2:54:22.980]  So he said, I have to submit to my liberal bully users
[2:54:22.980 --> 2:54:24.980]  So I can't come back on your show, they're my masters
[2:54:24.980 --> 2:54:25.980]  It's very, very sad
[2:54:25.980 --> 2:54:27.980]  But he is a really smart guy
[2:54:27.980 --> 2:54:29.980]  And he's made some really good points
[2:54:29.980 --> 2:54:30.980]  But the last part cut out
[2:54:30.980 --> 2:54:32.980]  Just elaborate on that again
[2:54:32.980 --> 2:54:35.980]  Well, they raised the point of how did a swarm of drones
[2:54:35.980 --> 2:54:38.980]  Make it all the way from Iran to Saudi Arabia
[2:54:38.980 --> 2:54:40.980]  500 miles undetected
[2:54:40.980 --> 2:54:42.980]  And then how come there's no details
[2:54:42.980 --> 2:54:44.980]  On what type of drones there were
[2:54:44.980 --> 2:54:47.980]  Like if Trump really said he has this proof
[2:54:47.980 --> 2:54:50.980]  That it was Iran, why can't he release that proof
[2:54:50.980 --> 2:54:53.980]  Just so we know
[2:54:53.980 --> 2:54:55.980]  I'm sorry, my mic's breaking up again
[2:54:55.980 --> 2:54:56.980]  I'm having technical difficulties
[2:54:56.980 --> 2:54:58.980]  I'm having to go off air here, I'm sorry
[2:54:58.980 --> 2:55:01.980]  Let's just say it again, the third time's going to be the charm here
[2:55:01.980 --> 2:55:03.980]  Alright
[2:55:03.980 --> 2:55:06.980]  Basically, if Trump has all this proof
[2:55:06.980 --> 2:55:09.980]  That it was Iran, why can't he release that proof
[2:55:09.980 --> 2:55:13.980]  And also how did this drone swarm go 500 miles undetected
[2:55:13.980 --> 2:55:15.980]  If Saudi Arabia has all this great equipment
[2:55:15.980 --> 2:55:20.980]  Well, I mean, listen
[2:55:20.980 --> 2:55:23.980]  You have to know that that's the point of cruise missiles
[2:55:23.980 --> 2:55:26.980]  Is that when someone's flying at 150 feet
[2:55:26.980 --> 2:55:29.980]  With and mapping the terrain
[2:55:29.980 --> 2:55:31.980]  That's the whole point of cruise missiles
[2:55:31.980 --> 2:55:34.980]  And why the Russians got cruise missiles, we can't stop
[2:55:34.980 --> 2:55:37.980]  We've got cruise missiles that they can't stop
[2:55:37.980 --> 2:55:41.980]  And so the idea that you can't fly drones in
[2:55:41.980 --> 2:55:44.980]  Off the coastline, they're saying it came from
[2:55:44.980 --> 2:55:46.980]  From Iran, Pompeo is
[2:55:46.980 --> 2:55:49.980]  Because Iran gave these cruise missiles to Yemen
[2:55:49.980 --> 2:55:52.980]  Who's taken the credit for it, did you know that?
[2:55:52.980 --> 2:55:55.980]  I've heard Yemen was involved
[2:55:55.980 --> 2:55:57.980]  I didn't know all the details on that
[2:55:57.980 --> 2:56:00.980]  But it just seems fishy to me, the whole thing is real fishy
[2:56:00.980 --> 2:56:03.980]  Well, you know, I got people calling me saying Iran
[2:56:03.980 --> 2:56:05.980]  Didn't take over ships, you know Iran's taking ships
[2:56:05.980 --> 2:56:08.980]  Officially announcing it, right?
[2:56:08.980 --> 2:56:12.980]  Yeah, and the point you brought up with Obama and Kerry
[2:56:12.980 --> 2:56:15.980]  Kind of overseeing the whole Iran thing is very important
[2:56:15.980 --> 2:56:19.980]  Because they keep getting involved with Iran
[2:56:19.980 --> 2:56:22.980]  And trying to go behind Trump's back, which is a big problem
[2:56:22.980 --> 2:56:25.980]  But if Iran really has these kind of capabilities
[2:56:25.980 --> 2:56:30.980]  To do strikes from 500 miles away undetected until it happens
[2:56:30.980 --> 2:56:33.980]  That's a big problem
[2:56:33.980 --> 2:56:36.980]  Well, you're absolutely right, we should ask questions
[2:56:36.980 --> 2:56:38.980]  And I wasn't irritated with you, I don't normally have problems
[2:56:38.980 --> 2:56:41.980]  I've gone to this wireless receiver and it's buzzing in and out
[2:56:41.980 --> 2:56:43.980]  And I kind of pick up some of the other mics occasionally
[2:56:43.980 --> 2:56:46.980]  It's a little bit irritating, but really, really good points
[2:56:46.980 --> 2:56:48.980]  I appreciate your call, God bless you
[2:56:48.980 --> 2:56:50.980]  Okay, we got one caller in
[2:56:50.980 --> 2:56:52.980]  I'm going to try to be a big boy
[2:56:52.980 --> 2:56:55.980]  And I come back on the other side of this stinking break
[2:56:55.980 --> 2:56:58.980]  And we're going to try to go to the other callers, Casey and Jim
[2:56:58.980 --> 2:57:01.980]  And Duncan and David and Doyle and Ryan and others
[2:57:01.980 --> 2:57:04.980]  But this whole situation really, really angers me
[2:57:04.980 --> 2:57:06.980]  And I'll just be honest with you
[2:57:06.980 --> 2:57:10.980]  We have the French Revolution Part 2 happening
[2:57:10.980 --> 2:57:14.980]  Devil worshipers that want to end the family and sexualize children
[2:57:14.980 --> 2:57:17.980]  Like all cults do from Charles Manson to you name it
[2:57:17.980 --> 2:57:20.980]  Because they're vampires targeting children's energy
[2:57:20.980 --> 2:57:23.980]  And that's why everywhere they're announcing that men are going to be in the showers
[2:57:23.980 --> 2:57:25.980]  Or little girls and all the rest of it
[2:57:25.980 --> 2:57:28.980]  And that men are going to screw your kids, boy scouts, not just the way it is
[2:57:28.980 --> 2:57:30.980]  And they're not going to stop because we let them
[2:57:30.980 --> 2:57:33.980]  And it just, you know...
[2:57:33.980 --> 2:57:35.980]  A lot of people are good in this country
[2:57:35.980 --> 2:57:37.980]  But just a lot of folks want to be slaves and they want to bow down
[2:57:37.980 --> 2:57:38.980]  Because they're followers
[2:57:38.980 --> 2:57:41.980]  We don't have enough leaders in this country
[2:57:42.980 --> 2:57:45.980]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet
[2:57:45.980 --> 2:57:49.980]  But I'm here to tell you, the products that in FullWarsLive.com are
[2:57:49.980 --> 2:57:53.980]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested
[2:57:53.980 --> 2:57:59.980]  Most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature

[2:58:03.980 --> 2:58:06.980]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years
[2:58:06.980 --> 2:58:09.980]  To help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system
[2:58:09.980 --> 2:58:11.980]  So many things, it sells itself
[2:58:11.980 --> 2:58:16.980]  But normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid
[2:58:16.980 --> 2:58:20.980]  The active enzyme or system in the plant
[2:58:20.980 --> 2:58:22.980]  Originally obviously from India
[2:58:22.980 --> 2:58:28.980]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level
[2:58:28.980 --> 2:58:30.980]  And it's got other natural things that help boost it
[2:58:30.980 --> 2:58:34.980]  Help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it
[2:58:34.980 --> 2:58:37.980]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet
[2:58:37.980 --> 2:58:41.980]  50% off on bodies at FullWarsLive.com

[2:58:48.980 --> 2:58:51.980]  That has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter
[2:58:51.980 --> 2:58:53.980]  And approved for that by the FDA
[2:58:53.980 --> 2:58:56.980]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it
[2:58:56.980 --> 2:58:58.980]  In the last two years, it's been a best seller
[2:58:58.980 --> 2:59:02.980]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream
[2:59:02.980 --> 2:59:06.980]  That basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there
[2:59:06.980 --> 2:59:10.980]  At a lower price with their patented silver salt technology in it
[2:59:10.980 --> 2:59:14.980]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid
[2:59:14.980 --> 2:59:19.980]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil
[2:59:19.980 --> 2:59:21.980]  And so much more, it's in two sizes
[2:59:21.980 --> 2:59:25.980]  Super silver skin cream in 3.4oz and in the smaller one
[2:59:25.980 --> 2:59:27.980]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere
[2:59:27.980 --> 2:59:29.980]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price
[2:59:29.980 --> 2:59:33.980]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLive.com
[2:59:33.980 --> 2:59:36.980]  Get your super silver skin cream today

[2:59:39.980 --> 3:00:04.980]  As of taping this September 10th
[3:00:09.980 --> 3:00:13.980]  Transmission, you are the resistance
[3:00:13.980 --> 3:00:23.980]  All right, good stuff, I can get a bad mood
[3:00:23.980 --> 3:00:25.980]  Listen to the song, I was just going to get a bad mood
[3:00:25.980 --> 3:00:28.980]  Russian programming, it's Russian techno from the 70s
[3:00:28.980 --> 3:00:31.980]  Before they really had tech notes, you know that?
[3:00:31.980 --> 3:00:36.980]  It is, doo doo doo doo doo
[3:00:36.980 --> 3:00:38.980]  All right, let's get back to your phone calls
[3:00:38.980 --> 3:00:40.980]  Hold on, Putin, what's my orders?
[3:00:40.980 --> 3:00:43.980]  I've seen the latest thing, I didn't air it Sunday, I meant to air it
[3:00:43.980 --> 3:00:46.980]  These folks online literally think that my earpiece
[3:00:46.980 --> 3:00:48.980]  I'm being told what to say
[3:00:48.980 --> 3:00:51.980]  Sometimes they leave mics open, I'm hearing things, but that's about it
[3:00:51.980 --> 3:00:56.980]  Yeah, people are really telling me what to say
[3:00:56.980 --> 3:00:59.980]  And it was really funny, maybe I'll play it after the college next segment
[3:00:59.980 --> 3:01:05.980]  They were saying, I'm Bill Hicks, but what was funny is they were saying
[3:01:05.980 --> 3:01:08.980]  What's his name?
[3:01:08.980 --> 3:01:13.980]  Mark Dice is Joaquin Phoenix or something like that
[3:01:13.980 --> 3:01:17.980]  Oh yeah, Putin says Russia developed meme
[3:01:17.980 --> 3:01:19.980]  Capable of making Alex Jones the next US president
[3:01:19.980 --> 3:01:23.980]  And the leftists are sitting that around like it's serious
[3:01:23.980 --> 3:01:26.980]  I gotta go to Russia, man, I gotta meet my bosses sometime
[3:01:26.980 --> 3:01:29.980]  And I'll even joke like that and they'll put out stuff on YouTube going
[3:01:29.980 --> 3:01:31.980]  Look, he admits he's a Russian
[3:01:31.980 --> 3:01:35.980]  And the left all goes, God almighty, it's incredible
[3:01:35.980 --> 3:01:39.980]  And again, they just said that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted a woman
[3:01:39.980 --> 3:01:42.980]  And they talked to her, she had never met Kavanaugh, that never happened
[3:01:42.980 --> 3:01:46.980]  But the leftists looked at her name in a yearbook from college and just said
[3:01:46.980 --> 3:01:50.980]  I mean, these people are nuts, they're nuts
[3:01:50.980 --> 3:01:54.980]  And so I do not blame the audience thinking that this attack on the refineries didn't happen
[3:01:54.980 --> 3:01:57.980]  Okay, Saudi Arabia blew up its own refineries
[3:01:57.980 --> 3:02:00.980]  And then the Yemen rebels took credit for it
[3:02:00.980 --> 3:02:03.980]  Whatever, this is a nightmare
[3:02:03.980 --> 3:02:05.980]  Just thank God we're energy independent now
[3:02:05.980 --> 3:02:08.980]  And we're the global world oil exporter
[3:02:08.980 --> 3:02:14.980]  Great job, America, great job, Texas, great job, you know, rough necks
[3:02:14.980 --> 3:02:19.980]  Great job, America is exceptional again
[3:02:19.980 --> 3:02:22.980]  The world's biggest oil exporter
[3:02:22.980 --> 3:02:24.980]  Thank God we're leading in something, huh?
[3:02:24.980 --> 3:02:27.980]  We're back, bitches
[3:02:27.980 --> 3:02:31.980]  Ryan in Michigan, thanks for holding you're a real trooper
[3:02:34.980 --> 3:02:36.980]  Absolutely, Ryan, I'm doing good today
[3:02:36.980 --> 3:02:38.980]  Yep, how is Michigan?
[3:02:38.980 --> 3:02:40.980]  It's good, well, that's nice
[3:02:40.980 --> 3:02:42.980]  We'll come back to run and eat
[3:02:42.980 --> 3:02:45.980]  Oh, you're there, hey, how you doing, man?
[3:02:45.980 --> 3:02:47.980]  Awesome, good to have you here
[3:02:47.980 --> 3:02:50.980]  Hey, thanks for being here, I just want to say
[3:02:50.980 --> 3:02:54.980]  I want to get to the real time, I think, but I want to call the funeral
[3:02:54.980 --> 3:02:57.980]  I really want to hear you, but do me a big favor
[3:02:57.980 --> 3:03:00.980]  You got that phone wrapped up in a shirt or something?
[3:03:00.980 --> 3:03:01.980]  No, can you hear me now?
[3:03:01.980 --> 3:03:04.980]  I sure can, my friend, hit me and hit me hard
[3:03:04.980 --> 3:03:09.980]  I hear you, God, it's good, whoa, yeah
[3:03:09.980 --> 3:03:11.980]  Come on, talk to me, baby
[3:03:11.980 --> 3:03:13.980]  Alright, so I want to get into Iran
[3:03:13.980 --> 3:03:15.980]  But first I want to hear you
[3:03:15.980 --> 3:03:18.980]  Go ahead, yeah
[3:03:18.980 --> 3:03:20.980]  Go ahead, sorry
[3:03:20.980 --> 3:03:24.980]  Alright, I had enlarged prostate when I was 19
[3:03:24.980 --> 3:03:27.980]  I went on all the pharmaceutical drugs
[3:03:27.980 --> 3:03:29.980]  Gave me some really bad side effects
[3:03:29.980 --> 3:03:33.980]  And I started taking your body a few years ago
[3:03:33.980 --> 3:03:38.980]  No side effects, I mean, it totally got rid of my enlarged prostate
[3:03:38.980 --> 3:03:40.980]  Which is really abnormal for young guys
[3:03:40.980 --> 3:03:42.980]  So I want to thank you for that, changed my life
[3:03:42.980 --> 3:03:44.980]  Well, I want to apologize to you
[3:03:44.980 --> 3:03:46.980]  Not just because you're doing a plug
[3:03:46.980 --> 3:03:48.980]  But I'm going to be honest with you
[3:03:48.980 --> 3:03:50.980]  I've hit the wall with all this war stuff
[3:03:50.980 --> 3:03:51.980]  And the pedophile stuff
[3:03:51.980 --> 3:03:53.980]  And so I'm freaking out on areas
[3:03:53.980 --> 3:03:54.980]  Nothing to do with the callers
[3:03:54.980 --> 3:03:57.980]  I'm actually freaking out right now, okay
[3:03:57.980 --> 3:03:58.980]  I just can't handle it anymore
[3:03:58.980 --> 3:04:00.980]  I thought that, like, if I exposed everything
[3:04:00.980 --> 3:04:02.980]  The devil worshiped the pedophilia
[3:04:02.980 --> 3:04:04.980]  The cancer viruses, the vaccines, the fluoride
[3:04:04.980 --> 3:04:06.980]  Everybody, I mean, I've got another family member
[3:04:06.980 --> 3:04:07.980]  With a frickin' breast cancer
[3:04:07.980 --> 3:04:09.980]  That's got to go under chemotherapy starting next week
[3:04:09.980 --> 3:04:12.980]  And I am pissed and I am sick of these globalists
[3:04:12.980 --> 3:04:13.980]  And so I'm mad at myself
[3:04:13.980 --> 3:04:15.980]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to talk to you
[3:04:15.980 --> 3:04:16.980]  I'm going to give you the floor
[3:04:16.980 --> 3:04:18.980]  But I'll tell you what it is
[3:04:18.980 --> 3:04:20.980]  They're trying to push us into violence
[3:04:20.980 --> 3:04:21.980]  Because the truth is
[3:04:21.980 --> 3:04:23.980]  Is that that's really where all this is going
[3:04:23.980 --> 3:04:25.980]  I mean, that's really it
[3:04:25.980 --> 3:04:27.980]  Is that I always tell you what I really believe
[3:04:27.980 --> 3:04:29.980]  And I'm not calling for violence
[3:04:29.980 --> 3:04:30.980]  But I'm just telling you
[3:04:30.980 --> 3:04:31.980]  I'm pissed at myself right now
[3:04:31.980 --> 3:04:33.980]  Because they have trained us to put up with stuff
[3:04:33.980 --> 3:04:35.980]  And then all we do is bitch about it
[3:04:35.980 --> 3:04:36.980]  And so I think some of the listeners out there
[3:04:36.980 --> 3:04:37.980]  Have a good point
[3:04:37.980 --> 3:04:38.980]  That we should just stop talking
[3:04:38.980 --> 3:04:40.980]  The problem is
[3:04:42.980 --> 3:04:43.980]  Let me go down that road
[3:04:43.980 --> 3:04:44.980]  But I guess they've taken us to that
[3:04:44.980 --> 3:04:46.980]  I'm not saying do it yet
[3:04:46.980 --> 3:04:48.980]  But I think that we have to be honest
[3:04:48.980 --> 3:04:50.980]  You know, they're killing babies after they're born
[3:04:50.980 --> 3:04:53.980]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue

[3:06:23.980 --> 3:06:24.980]  Very thankful for everybody
[3:06:24.980 --> 3:06:26.980]  And we're going to hold the line against these leftists
[3:06:26.980 --> 3:06:28.980]  But they're throwing
[3:06:28.980 --> 3:06:30.980]  Like a goblin dying or a zombie dying
[3:06:30.980 --> 3:06:32.980]  They're poisonous vomit
[3:06:32.980 --> 3:06:33.980]  They're trying to spray vomit on us
[3:06:33.980 --> 3:06:34.980]  And make us be demoralized
[3:06:34.980 --> 3:06:36.980]  By how bad they stink in their death rows
[3:06:36.980 --> 3:06:38.980]  The world's awakening
[3:06:38.980 --> 3:06:39.980]  Evil's on the run
[3:06:39.980 --> 3:06:41.980]  They're trying to sabotage everything
[3:06:41.980 --> 3:06:43.980]  They're trying to incite us into violence
[3:06:43.980 --> 3:06:44.980]  And I don't want to go there
[3:06:44.980 --> 3:06:46.980]  But we all have to work super hard
[3:06:46.980 --> 3:06:49.980]  In the Info War to kick their asses
[3:06:49.980 --> 3:06:51.980]  Because they're assaulting children
[3:06:51.980 --> 3:06:53.980]  Killing babies after they're born
[3:06:53.980 --> 3:06:54.980]  Doing all this evil everywhere
[3:06:54.980 --> 3:06:56.980]  And they've got to be stopped
[3:06:56.980 --> 3:06:57.980]  We have to take our governments back
[3:06:57.980 --> 3:06:59.980]  We have to indict their asses
[3:06:59.980 --> 3:07:00.980]  And do it legally and lawfully
[3:07:00.980 --> 3:07:01.980]  And not let them cause a civil war
[3:07:01.980 --> 3:07:04.980]  Because every document shows that's what they want
[3:07:04.980 --> 3:07:08.980]  But I understand folks out there
[3:07:08.980 --> 3:07:09.980]  That are pissed and are angry
[3:07:09.980 --> 3:07:10.980]  And that are sick of it
[3:07:10.980 --> 3:07:11.980]  But the Beto work and all of them
[3:07:11.980 --> 3:07:13.980]  Are trying to incite a war
[3:07:13.980 --> 3:07:14.980]  And we do not need that
[3:07:14.980 --> 3:07:15.980]  And the neocons and the globalists
[3:07:15.980 --> 3:07:17.980]  Are behind the scenes with Iran
[3:07:17.980 --> 3:07:18.980]  Trying to trick everybody into this
[3:07:18.980 --> 3:07:21.980]  I'm telling you, it's a globalist op
[3:07:21.980 --> 3:07:24.980]  Brian, start over with
[3:07:24.980 --> 3:07:25.980]  What you were talking about with your prostate
[3:07:25.980 --> 3:07:27.980]  That's very important
[3:07:27.980 --> 3:07:30.980]  So I had a large prostate when I was very young
[3:07:30.980 --> 3:07:31.980]  And it's very uncommon
[3:07:31.980 --> 3:07:33.980]  It was in the early 40s, you know that
[3:07:33.980 --> 3:07:36.980]  And I had it when I was about 19
[3:07:36.980 --> 3:07:38.980]  And I went on to have a big form of drugs
[3:07:38.980 --> 3:07:41.980]  And it did help
[3:07:41.980 --> 3:07:43.980]  But I had some other side effects
[3:07:43.980 --> 3:07:44.980]  Which I don't need to get into
[3:07:44.980 --> 3:07:46.980]  But I stopped that
[3:07:46.980 --> 3:07:49.980]  And I kind of just lived with it for a while
[3:07:49.980 --> 3:07:50.980]  You know, for many years
[3:07:50.980 --> 3:07:51.980]  And I took care of tumors
[3:07:51.980 --> 3:07:53.980]  And then I'm telling you
[3:07:53.980 --> 3:07:56.980]  The inflammation went away, the pain went away
[3:07:56.980 --> 3:07:58.980]  I mean, I can't even explain
[3:07:58.980 --> 3:07:59.980]  Really well if it did
[3:07:59.980 --> 3:08:02.980]  But it was fantastic what it's done for me
[3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:04.980]  Also, you know, the iodine
[3:08:04.980 --> 3:08:06.980]  Is probably the most important supplement
[3:08:06.980 --> 3:08:08.980]  That I take of yours
[3:08:08.980 --> 3:08:10.980]  In terms of metabolism, energy
[3:08:10.980 --> 3:08:13.980]  And, you know, just maintaining weight
[3:08:13.980 --> 3:08:17.980]  So, yeah, I want to thank you for that as well
[3:08:17.980 --> 3:08:19.980]  Well, sir, don't thank me
[3:08:19.980 --> 3:08:21.980]  I want to explain something
[3:08:21.980 --> 3:08:25.980]  I got depressed, you know
[3:08:25.980 --> 3:08:27.980]  20 years ago really learning all this
[3:08:27.980 --> 3:08:28.980]  And getting deep into it
[3:08:28.980 --> 3:08:29.980]  I didn't even know I was depressed
[3:08:29.980 --> 3:08:31.980]  Because I worked 18 hours a day
[3:08:31.980 --> 3:08:32.980]  And did a lot of stuff
[3:08:32.980 --> 3:08:33.980]  And had a bunch of children
[3:08:33.980 --> 3:08:35.980]  And, you know, was happy overall
[3:08:35.980 --> 3:08:37.980]  But was so upset about it
[3:08:37.980 --> 3:08:38.980]  I started drinking
[3:08:38.980 --> 3:08:39.980]  I started eating like a pig
[3:08:39.980 --> 3:08:41.980]  I went from running six miles, you know
[3:08:41.980 --> 3:08:42.980]  Every other day and lifting weights
[3:08:42.980 --> 3:08:43.980]  And being in great shape
[3:08:43.980 --> 3:08:45.980]  Looking like Bruce Lee to, you know
[3:08:45.980 --> 3:08:48.980]  When 280 pounds and being 100 pounds overweight
[3:08:48.980 --> 3:08:50.980]  Just because I didn't care anymore
[3:08:50.980 --> 3:08:52.980]  Because when I get death threats or attacks
[3:08:52.980 --> 3:08:53.980]  I just started not caring about myself
[3:08:53.980 --> 3:08:55.980]  I wasn't scared of dying either
[3:08:55.980 --> 3:08:56.980]  I just turned loose
[3:08:56.980 --> 3:08:58.980]  Now I've slowly gotten back in shape
[3:08:58.980 --> 3:09:00.980]  And when I religiously take the supplement
[3:09:00.980 --> 3:09:01.980]  It makes my life better
[3:09:01.980 --> 3:09:04.980]  So the things we sell are all missing links
[3:09:04.980 --> 3:09:06.980]  That we know the globalists are trying to suppress
[3:09:06.980 --> 3:09:07.980]  In the food chain
[3:09:07.980 --> 3:09:08.980]  We even have documents
[3:09:08.980 --> 3:09:10.980]  So things like iodine, the good halogen
[3:09:10.980 --> 3:09:11.980]  They bomb you with the bad halogen
[3:09:11.980 --> 3:09:13.980]  Fluoride and other bad halogens
[3:09:13.980 --> 3:09:17.980]  Things like turmeric, incredible natural
[3:09:17.980 --> 3:09:19.980]  System that kills inflammation
[3:09:19.980 --> 3:09:20.980]  DNA force
[3:09:20.980 --> 3:09:23.980]  You can actually say what it's got in it
[3:09:23.980 --> 3:09:25.980]  Makes telomeres last longer
[3:09:25.980 --> 3:09:27.980]  And makes nerves regrow
[3:09:27.980 --> 3:09:28.980]  I mean, it's insane
[3:09:28.980 --> 3:09:30.980]  PQQ CoQ10, the type we have is the best
[3:09:30.980 --> 3:09:32.980]  So absolutely, these are real things
[3:09:32.980 --> 3:09:34.980]  And so people like David Hoggo
[3:09:34.980 --> 3:09:36.980]  Jones claims there's poison in the water
[3:09:36.980 --> 3:09:37.980]  And then sells filters
[3:09:37.980 --> 3:09:38.980]  He's manipulating
[3:09:38.980 --> 3:09:39.980]  No, it's a straight shoot
[3:09:39.980 --> 3:09:41.980]  I want to fund our information warfare
[3:09:41.980 --> 3:09:43.980]  Get people healthy and safe at the same time
[3:09:43.980 --> 3:09:44.980]  And be able to reach others
[3:09:44.980 --> 3:09:46.980]  By you getting good products you need
[3:09:46.980 --> 3:09:48.980]  That's how you build a civilization
[3:09:48.980 --> 3:09:50.980]  But the Satanists are blind to that
[3:09:50.980 --> 3:09:52.980]  They don't get building larger systems
[3:09:52.980 --> 3:09:55.980]  Symbiotic relationships, non-zero-sum games
[3:09:55.980 --> 3:09:58.980]  They don't get God's plan of a win-win situation
[3:09:58.980 --> 3:10:00.980]  They get a winner and loser situation
[3:10:00.980 --> 3:10:02.980]  And a conquest economy, not a renaissance economy
[3:10:02.980 --> 3:10:06.980]  So that's why these supplements work so good
[3:10:06.980 --> 3:10:08.980]  Is they really are excellent
[3:10:08.980 --> 3:10:10.980]  I mean, take ultimate female force
[3:10:10.980 --> 3:10:13.980]  There's $17 a product in it
[3:10:13.980 --> 3:10:16.980]  Okay, supermodel vitality is a big hit
[3:10:16.980 --> 3:10:18.980]  Because men like it
[3:10:18.980 --> 3:10:20.980]  And obviously it does things to your body
[3:10:20.980 --> 3:10:22.980]  Your hormones, it really works
[3:10:22.980 --> 3:10:24.980]  But our audience is only 20% women
[3:10:24.980 --> 3:10:26.980]  Well, they're not getting it
[3:10:26.980 --> 3:10:28.980]  So I'm giving you free bottles of supermodel vitality
[3:10:28.980 --> 3:10:29.980]  Because I know women take it
[3:10:29.980 --> 3:10:30.980]  Or order more of it
[3:10:30.980 --> 3:10:33.980]  But I mean, other stuff is at $5
[3:10:33.980 --> 3:10:35.980]  And it really works
[3:10:35.980 --> 3:10:38.980]  We're putting $16, $17, $18 in these things
[3:10:38.980 --> 3:10:40.980]  Nobody does that
[3:10:40.980 --> 3:10:42.980]  And so that's why they work so good
[3:10:42.980 --> 3:10:44.980]  No iodine out there is really atomic
[3:10:44.980 --> 3:10:46.980]  That means it's rare earth crystal
[3:10:46.980 --> 3:10:48.980]  You've got to get a DEA license
[3:10:48.980 --> 3:10:50.980]  And have it locked up in a special facility
[3:10:50.980 --> 3:10:51.980]  To have real iodine
[3:10:51.980 --> 3:10:53.980]  You should not take any other iodine out there
[3:10:53.980 --> 3:10:54.980]  None of it's real
[3:10:54.980 --> 3:10:56.980]  We are the only ones that aren't lazy
[3:10:56.980 --> 3:10:58.980]  And women got the real one
[3:10:58.980 --> 3:11:00.980]  Yeah, the real things are
[3:11:00.980 --> 3:11:02.980]  I mean, it's just insane how these people
[3:11:02.980 --> 3:11:03.980]  Will do this stuff
[3:11:03.980 --> 3:11:04.980]  So damn right
[3:11:04.980 --> 3:11:06.980]  Now, you've got to consult a physician
[3:11:06.980 --> 3:11:08.980]  If you've not been on real iodine for years
[3:11:08.980 --> 3:11:10.980]  And your thyroid stuff's full of bad halogens
[3:11:10.980 --> 3:11:12.980]  Who knows what it'll do to you?
[3:11:12.980 --> 3:11:14.980]  Because you've got to have it to live
[3:11:14.980 --> 3:11:16.980]  But your body will use the bad stuff to operate
[3:11:16.980 --> 3:11:18.980]  So it's a sophisticated system
[3:11:18.980 --> 3:11:19.980]  But thank you for the plugs
[3:11:19.980 --> 3:11:21.980]  What was your point, Brian, before we go to Casey and Jim
[3:11:21.980 --> 3:11:23.980]  And others in that project?
[3:11:23.980 --> 3:11:24.980]  Well, I ran
[3:11:24.980 --> 3:11:26.980]  Mind you, I went through
[3:11:26.980 --> 3:11:28.980]  One hour ago
[3:11:28.980 --> 3:11:30.980]  We know they're trying to kick off
[3:11:30.980 --> 3:11:32.980]  A balanced resolution
[3:11:32.980 --> 3:11:34.980]  On behalf of the West
[3:11:34.980 --> 3:11:36.980]  And what I think they're trying to do
[3:11:36.980 --> 3:11:38.980]  Is they're trying to get our trucks over there
[3:11:38.980 --> 3:11:40.980]  So that we
[3:11:40.980 --> 3:11:42.980]  I mean, we obviously, we're armed
[3:11:42.980 --> 3:11:43.980]  We're trained to know what to do
[3:11:43.980 --> 3:11:44.980]  We don't want to
[3:11:44.980 --> 3:11:45.980]  But we will if we have to
[3:11:45.980 --> 3:11:46.980]  I promise you that
[3:11:46.980 --> 3:11:47.980]  And
[3:11:47.980 --> 3:11:49.980]  They don't want troops here to protect us
[3:11:49.980 --> 3:11:51.980]  To help protect us
[3:11:51.980 --> 3:11:53.980]  But that's what's going on in my view
[3:11:53.980 --> 3:11:54.980]  Oh, I agree
[3:11:54.980 --> 3:11:56.980]  They're trying to get the military out of the U.S.
[3:11:56.980 --> 3:11:57.980]  So they can kill Trump
[3:11:57.980 --> 3:11:58.980]  I'm telling you, my gut level
[3:11:58.980 --> 3:12:00.980]  But also my intellectual analysis is
[3:12:00.980 --> 3:12:01.980]  This is a real attack by Iran
[3:12:01.980 --> 3:12:02.980]  But Obama
[3:12:02.980 --> 3:12:04.980]  And Kerry and Hillary are advising him
[3:12:04.980 --> 3:12:06.980]  On it to set Trump up with the new bad pigs
[3:12:06.980 --> 3:12:07.980]  I have no idea what Matt Braggen's view is
[3:12:07.980 --> 3:12:08.980]  I respect him
[3:12:08.980 --> 3:12:09.980]  He's a smart guy
[3:12:09.980 --> 3:12:10.980]  We're not running a cult
[3:12:10.980 --> 3:12:11.980]  Other networks and stuff
[3:12:11.980 --> 3:12:13.980]  Get people on that agree with the boss's view
[3:12:13.980 --> 3:12:15.980]  Who is a puppet themselves
[3:12:15.980 --> 3:12:16.980]  We're not
[3:12:16.980 --> 3:12:17.980]  We are having a real debate
[3:12:17.980 --> 3:12:18.980]  God bless you, Brian
[3:12:18.980 --> 3:12:19.980]  I really appreciate your call
[3:12:19.980 --> 3:12:20.980]  God bless you
[3:12:20.980 --> 3:12:21.980]  Amazing caller
[3:12:21.980 --> 3:12:24.980]  Hey, who's been holding the longest
[3:12:24.980 --> 3:12:26.980]  Let's go ahead and take a call
[3:12:26.980 --> 3:12:28.980]  From Duncan in Idaho
[3:12:28.980 --> 3:12:30.980]  Duncan, you're on the air
[3:12:30.980 --> 3:12:32.980]  Welcome, what do you think's going on?
[3:12:32.980 --> 3:12:34.980]  Hey, Alex, thank you
[3:12:34.980 --> 3:12:36.980]  First off, I wanted to say
[3:12:36.980 --> 3:12:38.980]  Let's hear what
[3:12:38.980 --> 3:12:41.980]  Joel Scousen's council is on
[3:12:41.980 --> 3:12:43.980]  On Iran and the situation there
[3:12:43.980 --> 3:12:44.980]  Oh, that's a good idea
[3:12:44.980 --> 3:12:46.980]  Let's get Joel Scousen on tomorrow
[3:12:46.980 --> 3:12:48.980]  Yeah, thank you
[3:12:48.980 --> 3:12:49.980]  Also, I just wanted to
[3:12:49.980 --> 3:12:52.980]  Earlier this year, Mike Pompeo
[3:12:52.980 --> 3:12:55.980]  Former director of the CIA
[3:12:55.980 --> 3:12:57.980]  Said at the CIA, we stole, we cheated
[3:12:57.980 --> 3:12:59.980]  And we lied
[3:12:59.980 --> 3:13:00.980]  I saw that
[3:13:00.980 --> 3:13:03.980]  And there's all other kinds of quotes
[3:13:03.980 --> 3:13:04.980]  Bill Scousen
[3:13:04.980 --> 3:13:05.980]  Why would he say that on stage?
[3:13:05.980 --> 3:13:06.980]  I think he was talking about previously
[3:13:06.980 --> 3:13:09.980]  Saying he isn't going to do it now
[3:13:09.980 --> 3:13:13.980]  Well, I think he was just Braggen, right?
[3:13:13.980 --> 3:13:15.980]  They know what they're doing
[3:13:15.980 --> 3:13:18.980]  And they're just out in the open about it
[3:13:18.980 --> 3:13:21.980]  But as far as your frustration in that
[3:13:21.980 --> 3:13:23.980]  As far as solutions
[3:13:23.980 --> 3:13:25.980]  Obviously, we got to
[3:13:25.980 --> 3:13:28.980]  Educate the world on these
[3:13:28.980 --> 3:13:31.980]  Conspiracies, secret combinations
[3:13:31.980 --> 3:13:33.980]  But one thing we can do
[3:13:33.980 --> 3:13:35.980]  Is use the Constitution
[3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:37.980]  The Constitution specifically says
[3:13:37.980 --> 3:13:39.980]  A well-regulated militia
[3:13:39.980 --> 3:13:41.980]  Being necessary for the security
[3:13:41.980 --> 3:13:42.980]  Of a free state
[3:13:42.980 --> 3:13:43.980]  The right of the people to keep
[3:13:43.980 --> 3:13:45.980]  And bear arms shall not be infringed
[3:13:45.980 --> 3:13:47.980]  Now, a lot of people
[3:13:47.980 --> 3:13:49.980]  When you make that statement
[3:13:49.980 --> 3:13:52.980]  Think of firearms right off the bat
[3:13:52.980 --> 3:13:53.980]  Let's go to war
[3:13:53.980 --> 3:13:55.980]  That's not what we're talking about
[3:13:55.980 --> 3:13:58.980]  We're talking about the grand juries
[3:13:58.980 --> 3:14:01.980]  We just need 10 million patriotic men
[3:14:01.980 --> 3:14:03.980]  In this country to gather
[3:14:03.980 --> 3:14:05.980]  Around you as a medium
[3:14:05.980 --> 3:14:07.980]  With the battle cry
[3:14:07.980 --> 3:14:09.980]  And we can start forming those grand juries
[3:14:09.980 --> 3:14:11.980]  And indicting these people like you want to do
[3:14:11.980 --> 3:14:13.980]  Like all of us want to do
[3:14:13.980 --> 3:14:15.980]  So my suggestion is
[3:14:15.980 --> 3:14:17.980]  Let's get Dr. Edward Bibbiere on
[3:14:17.980 --> 3:14:19.980]  And let's figure out how to get
[3:14:19.980 --> 3:14:22.980]  The constitutional militia back in place
[3:14:22.980 --> 3:14:25.980]  So that we can organize these grand juries
[3:14:25.980 --> 3:14:26.980]  I totally agree
[3:14:26.980 --> 3:14:28.980]  You know the great part about Matt Bracken coming up
[3:14:28.980 --> 3:14:30.980]  Matt likes to take calls
[3:14:30.980 --> 3:14:32.980]  And so everybody holding
[3:14:32.980 --> 3:14:33.980]  I don't have to cut it this time anymore
[3:14:33.980 --> 3:14:34.980]  Everybody holding will get a chance
[3:14:34.980 --> 3:14:35.980]  To talk to Matt Bracken
[3:14:35.980 --> 3:14:36.980]  He's just as good as talking to me
[3:14:36.980 --> 3:14:37.980]  Maybe better
[3:14:37.980 --> 3:14:38.980]  He's not as quiet a maniac like me
[3:14:38.980 --> 3:14:40.980]  He hasn't gone completely crazy
[3:14:40.980 --> 3:14:41.980]  But like Norris Barkley says
[3:14:41.980 --> 3:14:42.980]  He's kind of going to go crazy
[3:14:42.980 --> 3:14:44.980]  He's got a lot of space when that happens
[3:14:44.980 --> 3:14:46.980]  You don't want to mean you don't care anymore
[3:14:46.980 --> 3:14:47.980]  But I do care
[3:14:47.980 --> 3:14:48.980]  I care so much
[3:14:48.980 --> 3:14:49.980]  I don't care anymore
[3:14:49.980 --> 3:14:51.980]  I am so sick of watching these evils come
[3:14:51.980 --> 3:14:53.980]  And they're worse than I ever thought
[3:14:53.980 --> 3:14:55.980]  And they're more evil than I even thought
[3:14:55.980 --> 3:14:56.980]  And it's all true
[3:14:56.980 --> 3:14:57.980]  And instead of like going
[3:14:57.980 --> 3:14:58.980]  Oh look I'm right
[3:14:58.980 --> 3:14:59.980]  Everything's coming out
[3:14:59.980 --> 3:15:01.980]  I am not happy
[3:15:01.980 --> 3:15:03.980]  Well let's do
[3:15:03.980 --> 3:15:05.980]  Let's get the grand juries in place
[3:15:05.980 --> 3:15:07.980]  To the constitutional militia
[3:15:07.980 --> 3:15:10.980]  And Dr. Edward Bibbiere is the expert on that
[3:15:10.980 --> 3:15:11.980]  We got to get him back on
[3:15:11.980 --> 3:15:12.980]  They're all awesome
[3:15:12.980 --> 3:15:13.980]  You're an awesome caller, remind me
[3:15:13.980 --> 3:15:14.980]  God bless you
[3:15:14.980 --> 3:15:15.980]  I appreciate your call
[3:15:15.980 --> 3:15:16.980]  I'm going to have Matt Bracken take over
[3:15:16.980 --> 3:15:17.980]  I'm going to be listening
[3:15:17.980 --> 3:15:19.980]  Very close to what he says
[3:15:19.980 --> 3:15:20.980]  And then callers
[3:15:20.980 --> 3:15:22.980]  You'll want to talk to Casey and Jim and David and Doyle
[3:15:22.980 --> 3:15:24.980]  I know he wants to take your calls
[3:15:24.980 --> 3:15:26.980]  No I see your face over there on the screen
[3:15:26.980 --> 3:15:28.980]  You want to take these calls?
[3:15:28.980 --> 3:15:29.980]  Sure
[3:15:29.980 --> 3:15:32.980]  I've got to sign into the
[3:15:32.980 --> 3:15:34.980]  To the system here
[3:15:34.980 --> 3:15:35.980]  You'll have your segment
[3:15:35.980 --> 3:15:36.980]  When you come up
[3:15:36.980 --> 3:15:37.980]  Tell us what you think
[3:15:37.980 --> 3:15:38.980]  And after that we'll go to all the callers
[3:15:38.980 --> 3:15:39.980]  877-789-2539

[3:15:42.980 --> 3:15:43.980]  I respect you
[3:15:43.980 --> 3:15:45.980]  We're going to find out his angle on this
[3:15:45.980 --> 3:15:46.980]  I think what we know for sure
[3:15:46.980 --> 3:15:47.980]  Is we're not exactly sure what's happening
[3:15:47.980 --> 3:16:13.980]  But you know the deep states involved

[3:18:53.380 --> 3:18:59.500]  We have entered a great time of change. The social engineers who serve Satan, who are
[3:18:59.500 --> 3:19:04.060]  in control of this planet, believe that if they can organize enough crises that they
[3:19:04.060 --> 3:19:10.820]  control, they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate world government
[3:19:10.820 --> 3:19:15.460]  known as a technocracy in their own words that will manage and control and manipulate
[3:19:15.460 --> 3:19:21.620]  every facet of our lives. At first, they give you just a few basic things to do. Don't support
[3:19:21.620 --> 3:19:25.780]  Trump. Don't promote Alex Jones. And once you've submitted to that, well don't say mother
[3:19:25.780 --> 3:19:30.620]  and father and, well, let us sterilize your children. Take these forced inoculations and
[3:19:30.620 --> 3:19:36.220]  here, take this Prozac pill and here, smoke this weaponized marijuana. Oh, don't be a
[3:19:36.220 --> 3:19:41.100]  Christian. This is truly the market to be system and we're on air right now covering
[3:19:41.100 --> 3:19:44.860]  it and you're awake. You're involved. You're engaged. You're an ambassador of truth. So
[3:19:44.860 --> 3:19:49.020]  I'm begging you for yourself and myself and my family and your family spread the word
[3:19:49.020 --> 3:19:55.180]  about infowars.com. The live shows right now.
[3:19:55.180 --> 3:20:21.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken.
[3:20:21.820 --> 3:20:30.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Okay, I guess the big thing now is talking
[3:20:30.580 --> 3:20:38.220]  about the drumbeat for war back in the Persian Gulf. And I wouldn't say I'm exactly a contrarian
[3:20:38.220 --> 3:20:45.140]  on this show. I understand everybody's deep suspicions because I have them too. You know,
[3:20:45.140 --> 3:20:52.340]  we live in an era of competing narratives. Truth doesn't seem to matter, especially,
[3:20:52.340 --> 3:20:57.700]  for example, you know, to the left in this country. As Alex said, they'll just go back
[3:20:57.700 --> 3:21:03.600]  to a high school or college yearbook, find names and then get some Democrat operative
[3:21:03.600 --> 3:21:09.180]  like Tom Spire. I think that's his name. To just say people told me these stories and
[3:21:09.180 --> 3:21:14.860]  that's enough for the New York Times to run a story. And it doesn't matter if the competing
[3:21:14.860 --> 3:21:21.180]  narratives are saying, that's all lies. That's all BS. Because the New York Times is just
[3:21:21.180 --> 3:21:28.340]  speaking to their own bubble, you know, their own hermetically sealed audience. And as long
[3:21:28.340 --> 3:21:34.020]  as they can keep their group together, the truth absolutely doesn't matter. So when it
[3:21:34.020 --> 3:21:40.140]  comes to Iran and these oil field fires, I understand why people are going to believe
[3:21:40.140 --> 3:21:45.780]  all kinds of things. First of all, there's such a distrust in our own government that
[3:21:45.780 --> 3:21:51.700]  a lot of people are just going to say, if our government says it, it's got to be a lie.
[3:21:51.700 --> 3:21:57.340]  There's a quote. It's attributed to Otto von Bismarck, who was a, you know, a leading
[3:21:57.340 --> 3:22:06.580]  German statesman leader in the late 19th century. He said, never believe anything in politics
[3:22:06.580 --> 3:22:12.500]  until it is officially denied. So yeah, there's, it goes way back. This whole idea that, you
[3:22:12.500 --> 3:22:17.180]  know, if my government is saying the sky is blue, I'm probably not going to believe them.
[3:22:17.180 --> 3:22:23.020]  I'm going to go out and check. But in this case, you know, you can't just say, I distrust
[3:22:23.020 --> 3:22:27.780]  my government, right? I think that, you know, the Israelis and the, you know, the Jewish
[3:22:27.780 --> 3:22:33.100]  bankers, they're in charge of everything. So they must be doing it. That's a very simplistic
[3:22:33.100 --> 3:22:40.780]  naive view of the world. And then you have to say, all right, let's remove our own perspective.
[3:22:40.780 --> 3:22:45.860]  Just take our part of the equation off the board, like you're doing, you know, like you're
[3:22:45.860 --> 3:22:49.900]  doing algebra. Just take our side of the equation off the board. Let's study the other side
[3:22:49.900 --> 3:22:57.660]  of the equation. The Iranians definitely have an end times view of the world. It doesn't
[3:22:57.660 --> 3:23:04.900]  matter if the majority of Iranians want to be modern and want to join, you know, the
[3:23:04.900 --> 3:23:10.740]  modern world, want to let their hair down, so to speak. They're not in charge. The people
[3:23:10.740 --> 3:23:17.180]  who are in charge can still drag people out and hang them for, you know, being homosexuals
[3:23:17.180 --> 3:23:23.820]  or being drug addicts. Women that were engaged in these, in these no he job demonstrations
[3:23:23.820 --> 3:23:28.900]  a few months ago, are in prison, probably getting, you know, gang raped by guards on
[3:23:28.900 --> 3:23:34.300]  a daily basis to humiliate them. It's part of the punishment. If they're ever released
[3:23:34.300 --> 3:23:40.180]  from prison, they're going to serve as object reminders, don't go against the regime. So
[3:23:40.180 --> 3:23:46.740]  the same, the same crazed foot and end times fanatics that are in charge of Iran today,
[3:23:46.740 --> 3:23:52.580]  they're the same ones that have been in charge since 1979. And they're getting very old.
[3:23:52.580 --> 3:23:57.140]  They see the social current in their own country going against them. So if they're going to
[3:23:57.140 --> 3:24:02.660]  have this end times showdown, they want to have it on their watch. They're afraid that
[3:24:02.660 --> 3:24:07.580]  if they let this expire, if they let it run out, there's going to be some kind of detente
[3:24:07.580 --> 3:24:14.500]  within future regimes that to their way of thinking would be a sellout of Shia Islam
[3:24:14.500 --> 3:24:21.020]  and their belief in, you know, how the world should be run. So they'd rather have it happen
[3:24:21.020 --> 3:24:29.220]  now. And I'm going back now to the tanker of the tanker battles or the tanker limpid
[3:24:29.220 --> 3:24:39.180]  mine attacks of a couple of months ago. And this is my theory. If you have America self-sufficient
[3:24:39.180 --> 3:24:46.660]  in oil, Trump could literally say, hey, the straits of Hormuz, it's not our problem. Saudi
[3:24:46.660 --> 3:24:53.300]  Arabia refineries, 5% of the world's oil taken offline doesn't concern us. You know,
[3:24:53.300 --> 3:24:59.540]  in fact, we've got a strategic petroleum reserve. We've got salt caves full of oil enough for
[3:24:59.540 --> 3:25:04.940]  months and months with absolutely, you know, under wartime conditions. So it's not our
[3:25:04.940 --> 3:25:11.260]  problem. So to the extent that Trump even gets involved in this Saudi situation, it's
[3:25:11.260 --> 3:25:18.180]  because he's trying to, you know, keep the global balance, keep it, you know, the Chinese
[3:25:18.180 --> 3:25:25.100]  or the Japanese, the Koreans from freaking out to stabilize the oil price. But Iran is
[3:25:25.100 --> 3:25:31.260]  thinking we need to put so much pressure on the world that the world goes to Trump and
[3:25:31.260 --> 3:25:36.300]  says you have to renegotiate. You know, they're they're being these sanctions are really hurting
[3:25:36.300 --> 3:25:41.220]  them. They're crippling them. The tanker blowing up a few tankers burning a few tankers. It
[3:25:41.220 --> 3:25:47.780]  didn't do the job. So what this is, to my way of thinking, this is raising the ante.
[3:25:47.780 --> 3:25:54.780]  This is the Iranians making a calculus. Well, what did we get out of limpet mining the tankers?
[3:25:54.780 --> 3:26:01.860]  Not enough. They were still in the same situation. So we have to up the ante. Now this time,
[3:26:01.860 --> 3:26:07.500]  supposedly, these were done by drones. And if you look at a if you look at a map of the
[3:26:07.500 --> 3:26:13.860]  Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia from Yemen, south of Saudi Arabia, from the very border,
[3:26:13.860 --> 3:26:20.940]  it would be 1000 kilometers across the desert to reach these targets with drones from from
[3:26:20.940 --> 3:26:28.500]  the ocean side. It would be more like, you know, 150 kilometers max from Iran, a couple
[3:26:28.500 --> 3:26:34.100]  hundred kilometers. Then you so you have to get into the technical analysis of what kind
[3:26:34.100 --> 3:26:44.020]  of drone could have accomplished this mission. And and who has the capability of of of fabricating
[3:26:44.020 --> 3:26:49.380]  and deploying these types of drones, the Houthi militias, which are being in a in a they're
[3:26:49.380 --> 3:26:55.220]  in a starvation blockade right now, they can barely get enough food and ammunition to sustain
[3:26:55.220 --> 3:27:01.340]  their side of the Civil War in Yemen. Does anybody think that they've got a a drone project
[3:27:01.340 --> 3:27:07.300]  where they're going to build 1000 kilometer drones that can take out oil refineries? Nobody's
[3:27:07.300 --> 3:27:13.500]  buying that. Would the Iranians ship drones all the way to Yemen to fly them clear across
[3:27:13.500 --> 3:27:20.620]  the Saudi desert to hit these refineries? Why would they do that? So with drones, the big
[3:27:20.620 --> 3:27:28.740]  problem a problem is concealability. If they were launched, if they launched, for example,
[3:27:28.740 --> 3:27:34.900]  the truck borne missiles that they have tons of in Iran, if they launched them directly
[3:27:34.900 --> 3:27:41.460]  into Saudi to take out these these refineries, then their back their trail, their signature
[3:27:41.460 --> 3:27:46.980]  would be evident. There would be a known launching point, we would be able to look one satellite,
[3:27:46.980 --> 3:27:52.340]  see those rockets firing up. And we'd see, you know, we'd be able to construct radar
[3:27:52.340 --> 3:28:01.580]  traces and other other forensic traces that would back that drone strike straight to its
[3:28:01.580 --> 3:28:06.740]  origin in Iran. That's not going to happen either, unless the Iranians really just want
[3:28:06.740 --> 3:28:13.100]  to get into World War Three. So how were these drones launched? What kind of drones were
[3:28:13.100 --> 3:28:18.700]  they? And are we going to find out what really happened? When we come back after the after
[3:28:18.700 --> 3:28:23.460]  this break, I'm going to talk a little bit about different types of drones and their
[3:28:23.460 --> 3:28:31.780]  capabilities, their advantages, their disadvantages, and what can really happen from drone warfare
[3:28:31.780 --> 3:28:36.820]  that we're starting to see. We saw it with ISIS in northern Iraq with little quadrotors
[3:28:36.820 --> 3:28:42.180]  dropping grenades. We're seeing it with this refinery attack. Believe me, we could see it
[3:28:42.180 --> 3:28:46.580]  anywhere in the world. Any refinery could be hit like this anywhere. And we'll talk
[3:28:46.580 --> 3:28:51.700]  about it on the other side.
[3:28:51.700 --> 3:28:57.660]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now

[3:31:02.340 --> 3:31:05.660]  that have done the research to understand the global spattle plan and we know how to
[3:31:05.660 --> 3:31:10.740]  take them down. That's why they're so upset. Think how far we've come together. Even if
[3:31:10.740 --> 3:31:15.140]  we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against
[3:31:15.140 --> 3:31:20.700]  the truly satanic forces of the new world order who've really taken the mask off, the
[3:31:20.700 --> 3:31:25.580]  lines in the sand for everybody now. But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and

[3:32:55.140 --> 3:33:14.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:14.420 --> 3:33:20.420]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:33:20.420 --> 3:33:32.020]  Hey, we're talking about Iran and we're talking about drone warfare. And when we're speaking
[3:33:32.020 --> 3:33:39.140]  about drone warfare, captain, fix in your mind that there's a spectrum that goes all
[3:33:39.140 --> 3:33:44.940]  the way from the global hawk that the Iranians shot down over the Persian Gulf. The global
[3:33:44.940 --> 3:33:52.100]  hawk is like way bigger than a predator. It's a humongous aircraft. I think it's like comparable
[3:33:52.100 --> 3:33:58.620]  to a small jetliner and it can sail off for like, you know, a day or more all the way
[3:33:58.620 --> 3:34:07.020]  down to drones that mimic insects like dragonflies that can, you know, just sit on a tree branch
[3:34:07.020 --> 3:34:14.500]  recharging and then fly around your neighborhood or around your backyard taking pictures. Everything
[3:34:14.500 --> 3:34:20.820]  in between is a drone. But to say this was a drone attack, nobody can really wrap their
[3:34:20.820 --> 3:34:30.520]  hands around this. Now, two years ago in Ukraine, there was a massive ordinance depot that supposedly
[3:34:30.520 --> 3:34:38.380]  did a billion dollars worth of damage, where a small drone put a thermite grenade exactly
[3:34:38.380 --> 3:34:46.740]  into a really dangerous pile of high explosives. And the important thing to keep in mind about
[3:34:46.740 --> 3:34:54.500]  this is that when you're speaking about drones, you have to juggle all of these metrics. The
[3:34:54.500 --> 3:34:59.740]  payload, well, in the case of what you're seeing on the screen, you know, about a two
[3:34:59.740 --> 3:35:06.540]  kilogram thermite grenade set right on top of a stack of high explosives, you know, burning
[3:35:06.540 --> 3:35:12.020]  right through it can cause a cascade effect. Obviously, that's like a home run. That's
[3:35:12.020 --> 3:35:18.140]  a grand slam home run times a million to leverage that kind of effect. That's up there with
[3:35:18.140 --> 3:35:25.260]  box cutters for jets for buildings. It's a very high leverage payoff. But to fly a
[3:35:25.260 --> 3:35:31.020]  little drone with a thermite grenade straight into an ordinance depot, you'd have to have
[3:35:31.020 --> 3:35:36.540]  somebody in the country able to drive very close in a car, you know, within a couple
[3:35:36.540 --> 3:35:42.900]  miles to launch that small drone. Then at the other end, you've got things like the
[3:35:42.900 --> 3:35:48.580]  armed predators and raptor and reapers that can fly for, you know, a thousand kilometers
[3:35:48.580 --> 3:35:56.180]  stay up for 18 hours or fly in one line. If you're going to weaponize something like
[3:35:56.180 --> 3:36:02.780]  a predator so that it wasn't just loitering on station carrying a large fuel load, instead
[3:36:02.780 --> 3:36:08.060]  you were going to take out a lot of the fuel, put in high explosives and send it on a one
[3:36:08.060 --> 3:36:14.260]  way trip, making kind of like a poor man's Tomahawk cruise missile. That's something
[3:36:14.260 --> 3:36:20.900]  that the Iranians are certainly capable of doing. I mean, they have anti ship missiles
[3:36:20.900 --> 3:36:26.460]  that can go hundreds of kilometers and destroy a ship. And in the middle, though, you have
[3:36:26.460 --> 3:36:32.140]  drones that you could hack in the back of a pickup truck and launch from, say, 50 or
[3:36:32.140 --> 3:36:39.100]  100 kilometers away. This means that the launch vehicle for this attack against the
[3:36:39.100 --> 3:36:45.540]  Saudi oil fields, the launch platform could have been a ship in the Persian Gulf, or it
[3:36:45.540 --> 3:36:51.820]  could have been launched from a couple of like landrovers trucks out in the Saudi desert.
[3:36:51.820 --> 3:36:59.540]  Something that people don't really think about very much. But when you talk about, for example,
[3:36:59.540 --> 3:37:07.420]  Central Africa, the Sahara, places like Saudi Arabia, the open empty spaces are so vast
[3:37:07.420 --> 3:37:13.140]  that they're almost like an ocean in some respects. There are countries where the Americans
[3:37:13.140 --> 3:37:20.780]  where we'll just set up a predator base in the middle of nowhere in a country like Mali
[3:37:20.780 --> 3:37:28.940]  or Niger, 100 miles from nowhere, C-130s roll in, set up a predator drone base, and nobody
[3:37:28.940 --> 3:37:34.780]  even knows we're there. It gets refueled, it gets personnel changed once in a while,
[3:37:34.780 --> 3:37:40.300]  but it's like a ship in the ocean instead. It's a little base in the desert. So we know
[3:37:40.300 --> 3:37:46.180]  going back even to World War II you can drive all over the North African desert with columns
[3:37:46.180 --> 3:37:53.060]  of trucks like the SAS did and the long range desert group, American groups did it. So you
[3:37:53.060 --> 3:37:58.020]  could actually drive from Yemen into Saudi Arabia, get very close.
[3:37:58.020 --> 3:38:04.820]  Now, so it all depends on the payload and the precision. In the case of that Ukrainian
[3:38:04.820 --> 3:38:13.060]  ordnance depot, you have a very tiny payload on a very short range drone, but that payload
[3:38:13.060 --> 3:38:20.820]  that like two kilo thermite grenade payload can be put within inches, literally landed
[3:38:20.820 --> 3:38:28.140]  on top of something that they know will have a humongous explosion. All the way to at the
[3:38:28.140 --> 3:38:32.460]  other end, something almost as big as a predator drone, which I don't think that the Iranians
[3:38:32.460 --> 3:38:38.620]  are going to launch. Now, one other thing to keep in mind when, when these, when drones
[3:38:38.620 --> 3:38:44.980]  of any size, large to small, when they, when they have completed an attack, there's forensic
[3:38:44.980 --> 3:38:49.580]  evidence there. It's not like the thing is going to just disintegrate. Even in the midst
[3:38:49.580 --> 3:38:54.420]  of a big fireball, you're going to have duds. You're going to have some that, that the engine
[3:38:54.420 --> 3:38:59.140]  crapped out, you know, 10 miles from the target and crash lands in the desert. When
[3:38:59.140 --> 3:39:05.300]  you have, it's been quoted 10 different drones. When you have 10 drones doing an attack, you'll
[3:39:05.300 --> 3:39:10.220]  be lucky if eight of them make it to the target and are burned up. You're going to find pieces
[3:39:10.220 --> 3:39:15.300]  of the wing, pieces of the engine, and this will probably be able to be traced back to
[3:39:15.300 --> 3:39:21.420]  Iran. So there's, there's a big question for Iran concerning an attack like this, which
[3:39:21.420 --> 3:39:27.340]  is deniability. They don't want to just launch something from Iran on a ballistic trajectory,
[3:39:27.340 --> 3:39:32.060]  which can be traced straight back to the launch site. They want to do something like those
[3:39:32.060 --> 3:39:37.540]  limpet attacks that they can deny, the ship attacks, where they'll give some of these
[3:39:37.540 --> 3:39:46.100]  medium range, small pickup truck sized UAV drones that have maybe a hundred kilo payload,
[3:39:46.100 --> 3:39:51.660]  but with, with GPS targeting, which is very simple, commercial off the shelf stuff, with
[3:39:51.660 --> 3:39:59.020]  GPS targeting, a 100 kilogram high explosive payload can land within say, you know, 10
[3:39:59.020 --> 3:40:04.020]  or 20 feet of the target, which if you're talking about an oil refinery may certainly
[3:40:04.020 --> 3:40:11.380]  be enough to cause a, an immense fire all the way to, you know, a larger drone with
[3:40:11.380 --> 3:40:18.860]  a larger payload, but less precision or a smaller drone with a smaller payload, potentially
[3:40:18.860 --> 3:40:24.980]  if it's, if it's controlled by a video with an actual operator, then the drone can be
[3:40:24.980 --> 3:40:30.700]  set down exactly where you want it. In this case, I would guess that we're talking about
[3:40:30.700 --> 3:40:36.060]  intermediate sized drones that Iran will say, we don't know what you're talking about.
[3:40:36.060 --> 3:40:40.340]  We didn't do that. We didn't do it. They might have been launched from, from, you know,
[3:40:40.340 --> 3:40:45.260]  anywhere in the Saudi desert, a hundred miles from the targets, 200 miles from the targets.
[3:40:45.260 --> 3:40:49.460]  They, they didn't fly a thousand miles from Northern Yemen. I think that we can rule
[3:40:49.460 --> 3:40:54.900]  that out, but it wouldn't, it wouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility that these
[3:40:54.900 --> 3:40:59.980]  were fairly small launched from pickup trucks right inside of Saudi Arabia. They have their
[3:40:59.980 --> 3:41:07.460]  own ethnic Shia minority. So these oil, these Eastern oil fields, even though Saudi Arabia
[3:41:07.460 --> 3:41:13.180]  is majority Sunni, a lot of the workers in these Eastern oil fields are Shia who are
[3:41:13.180 --> 3:41:20.540]  sympathetic to Iran. So it's kind of a situation that could, if you extrapolated it to America,
[3:41:20.540 --> 3:41:25.980]  we also have minorities that might be, you know, hating the majorities, willing to launch
[3:41:25.980 --> 3:41:31.540]  drone attacks against their own refineries or other targets in a civil war type of scenario.
[3:41:31.540 --> 3:41:37.540]  Well, in, in the Iranian scenario, it wouldn't be hard for Iranian agents to deliver the
[3:41:37.540 --> 3:41:41.780]  kinds of, you know, folded up with the wings all stowed and everything, stuff that can
[3:41:41.780 --> 3:41:47.060]  fit in the back of a pickup truck, drive it out into the desert, go ahead and launch it
[3:41:47.060 --> 3:41:52.460]  from, you know, 50, 100 kilometers away. All it's going to do is zero in on the GPS
[3:41:52.460 --> 3:41:58.740]  coordinate close enough for government work. And that's probably what happened. And the
[3:41:58.740 --> 3:42:05.140]  fact that we don't have a, a clear forensic trace of this yet, I'm sure that we have our
[3:42:05.140 --> 3:42:11.780]  own FBI bombs, bomb people and EOD people over there going through this as the fires
[3:42:11.780 --> 3:42:17.460]  are put out, looking for the, the, you know, the surviving elements of these drones. That's
[3:42:17.460 --> 3:42:23.540]  going to be key to, to determining if Iran is actually responsible for this. And when
[3:42:23.540 --> 3:42:27.460]  we come back on the other side, I'm going to go straight to calls. I got some more to
[3:42:27.460 --> 3:42:33.260]  say about this, but on the other side of the break, we'll start taking calls, but just
[3:42:33.260 --> 3:42:38.940]  keep in mind this type of a drone attack, it's not unique to the Middle East. You know,
[3:42:38.940 --> 3:42:44.180]  we didn't think about nine 11 before nine 11. Well, our own refineries could be taken
[3:42:44.180 --> 3:42:47.620]  out this way.

[3:44:47.460 --> 3:44:56.340]  we're taping this September 10th. We have entered a great time of change. The social
[3:44:56.340 --> 3:45:02.540]  engineers who serve Satan who are in control of this planet believe that if they can organize
[3:45:02.540 --> 3:45:09.180]  enough crises that they control they can terrorize the planet into accepting a tyrannical corporate
[3:45:09.180 --> 3:45:14.460]  world government known as a technocracy in their own words that will manage and control
[3:45:14.460 --> 3:45:19.660]  and manipulate every facet of our lives. At first, they can do just a few basic things
[3:45:19.660 --> 3:45:24.740]  to do. Don't support Trump. Don't promote Alex Jones. And once you've submitted to that,
[3:45:24.740 --> 3:45:28.940]  well don't say mother and father and well let us sterilize your children. Take these
[3:45:28.940 --> 3:45:34.260]  forced inoculations and here take this Prozac pill and here smoke this weaponized marijuana.
[3:45:34.260 --> 3:45:39.500]  Oh, don't be a Christian. This is truly the market of the beast system and we're on air
[3:45:39.500 --> 3:45:43.900]  right now covering it and you're awake. You're involved. You're engaged. You're an ambassador
[3:45:43.900 --> 3:45:48.420]  of truth. So I'm begging you for yourself and myself and my family and your family spread
[3:45:48.420 --> 3:45:54.380]  the word about info wars.com. The live shows right now. I was among the first 12 years ago
[3:45:54.380 --> 3:46:00.780]  to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[3:46:00.780 --> 3:46:06.940]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting. I was the first to begin
[3:46:06.940 --> 3:46:11.540]  to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be
[3:46:11.540 --> 3:46:17.540]  harvested. I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson and info wars.com 15 years
[3:46:17.540 --> 3:46:22.540]  ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras for record everything you do
[3:46:22.540 --> 3:46:28.500]  and hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues like the Federal Reserve being private run
[3:46:28.500 --> 3:46:32.900]  for profit trying to control our economy that our government in Hollywood have been taken
[3:46:32.900 --> 3:46:38.020]  over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many others. We've been
[3:46:38.020 --> 3:46:42.420]  dead on and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale. That's why the globalists
[3:46:42.420 --> 3:46:47.020]  are trying to shut us down. And that's why you are more critical than ever to support
[3:46:47.020 --> 3:46:55.140]  the info war. Please support the info war however you can.
[3:46:55.140 --> 3:47:16.660]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[3:47:16.660 --> 3:47:28.980]  Alex Jones and now your host Matt Bracken. OK now I wrote something over the weekend
[3:47:28.980 --> 3:47:34.660]  just a short piece that mentions that Ukrainian thermite grenade to take out a billion dollars
[3:47:34.660 --> 3:47:39.620]  worth of Ukrainian ordinance and it's called the future is drone warfare. That's up on
[3:47:39.620 --> 3:47:47.700]  American partisan. But seriously there's nothing unique about the Persian Gulf when it comes
[3:47:47.700 --> 3:47:54.780]  to drone warfare. We already saw small mini weaponized drones in northern Iraq where now
[3:47:54.780 --> 3:48:01.020]  soldiers have to worry about some little quadrotor just zooming in very quickly dodging around
[3:48:01.020 --> 3:48:07.140]  and planting a grenade in your lap. This is no joke. You think about any type of a social
[3:48:07.140 --> 3:48:12.880]  breakdown in this country. That's going to be the future of warfare. You know your enemies
[3:48:12.880 --> 3:48:18.220]  might be one zip code over and you're going to be in drone range. The kind of drones that
[3:48:18.220 --> 3:48:24.340]  are launched from the back of a pickup truck can be made in a garage. And unless the government
[3:48:24.340 --> 3:48:31.820]  is willing to take GPS down or degrade the signal to a degree that would make it unusable
[3:48:31.820 --> 3:48:37.580]  for attack drones which they probably won't want to do because airplanes land and take
[3:48:37.580 --> 3:48:43.940]  off based on that. Ships drive through channels based on very precise GPS navigation today.
[3:48:43.940 --> 3:48:48.740]  But there's nothing to prevent somebody from creating the types of drones that I think were
[3:48:48.740 --> 3:48:54.820]  used in Iran. These medium sized drones. A crew of a couple of men can set up the wings
[3:48:54.820 --> 3:49:00.060]  get the engines running and launch a swarm of them just from trucks sitting out in the
[3:49:00.060 --> 3:49:07.740]  country. Drones with a range of 50 or 100 miles, 100 kilogram payload. That's enough
[3:49:07.740 --> 3:49:16.780]  to put a serious hurt on a refinery or a government building or anything else. We invest so much
[3:49:16.780 --> 3:49:23.300]  in our country at the high dollar billion dollar end. Space at the high frontier, the
[3:49:23.300 --> 3:49:32.180]  flights, the F-35 fighters, half a billion or something, an airplane. So we forget that
[3:49:32.180 --> 3:49:37.700]  there's this whole spectrum we're going to have to defend against. We've become like
[3:49:37.700 --> 3:49:42.420]  medieval knights with the world's greatest high tech armor. It's fantastic. No other
[3:49:42.420 --> 3:49:48.220]  knight can get an arrow through it or can find a chink in it. But a little wasp or a
[3:49:48.220 --> 3:49:54.100]  hornet can fly right through the visor and start stinging you in the eye. And the medieval
[3:49:54.100 --> 3:49:59.260]  knight has no defense against it. And that's how we have to think about the full spectrum
[3:49:59.260 --> 3:50:05.700]  of drones from the tiniest little like hand launched drones that can spot the enemy over
[3:50:05.700 --> 3:50:10.580]  the hill or deliver a little grenade on them all the way up to the predators and reapers.
[3:50:10.580 --> 3:50:15.740]  It's a full spectrum. And they're not going away. Government's not going to be able to
[3:50:15.740 --> 3:50:21.180]  tamp it down. People are going to create these in their own garages. And when all you need
[3:50:21.180 --> 3:50:27.700]  for targeting is a GPS, you know, to put it on a geographical location or a camera to
[3:50:27.700 --> 3:50:33.820]  even hit an individual target, you know, like an assassination weapon. This is the future
[3:50:33.820 --> 3:50:39.980]  is drone warfare. So we need to put a lot of effort into thinking about this. I'm going
[3:50:39.980 --> 3:50:45.260]  to take a call now. Casey in Mississippi wants to talk about the Iran situation and he's
[3:50:45.260 --> 3:50:48.940]  been holding for a long time. Go ahead, Casey, can you hear me?
[3:50:48.940 --> 3:50:53.620]  Yes, thank you, Matt, for taking my call. I'd like to get directly. I know we're short
[3:50:53.620 --> 3:50:58.820]  on time, so I'd like to get directly to the things that you brought up right there. I
[3:50:58.820 --> 3:51:04.740]  like to point some of the people in your vicinity to a company called Easy Aerial. When you
[3:51:04.740 --> 3:51:09.140]  speak about things that can happen within our country that deal with drones, there are
[3:51:09.140 --> 3:51:14.260]  certain organizations, certain companies that come to mind. Easy Aerial is one of them.
[3:51:14.260 --> 3:51:22.980]  I think this pairs. How is that? Is that easy or easy? I believe it's EASY. Okay. And it's
[3:51:22.980 --> 3:51:30.980]  easy, easy aerial and it pairs with carbine 911. Okay, so so we're looking at a influx
[3:51:30.980 --> 3:51:35.420]  of things that are coming into our country that that it's under the premise of dealing
[3:51:35.420 --> 3:51:41.580]  with solar energy. So what what the what the idea is or what they're putting forward is
[3:51:41.580 --> 3:51:49.620]  that these drones will be able to monitor the the wind machines without people having
[3:51:49.620 --> 3:51:55.500]  to go up themselves, which which is, you know, on its own a great idea. But if you look into
[3:51:55.500 --> 3:52:00.020]  the background of these of these companies, you'll see that there could potentially be
[3:52:00.020 --> 3:52:05.060]  in the farthest purpose. So again, easy aerial paired with carbine 911. And I want to see
[3:52:05.060 --> 3:52:11.660]  you know, I'm sorry, go ahead. Okay, I want to say one thing about about the fake news
[3:52:11.660 --> 3:52:16.300]  media, you know, quoted the fake news media, Trump did us a great service by pointing out
[3:52:16.300 --> 3:52:23.140]  that that the media pretty much as a whole is is quote unquote fake. But where he fell
[3:52:23.140 --> 3:52:29.260]  short was reinstating the Smith month act in order for us to be able to hear truth on
[3:52:29.260 --> 3:52:35.860]  the airways. And these people since the Smith month act was overturned, they are essentially
[3:52:35.860 --> 3:52:43.940]  allowed to propagate freely without any repercussions legally or whatever. So if if he's really
[3:52:43.940 --> 3:52:52.380]  behind American people, if he's a really 100% American first, since it was undone via executive
[3:52:52.380 --> 3:52:57.940]  order, it will be done and put back into place, executive order under
[3:52:57.940 --> 3:53:05.660]  Trump, I'm not familiar with that. Okay, sir. Oh, Smith month, I see it up. Yeah. Yeah,
[3:53:05.660 --> 3:53:10.820]  essentially what that what that did we need allowed the CIA and other and other organizations
[3:53:10.820 --> 3:53:16.820]  and I don't want to say all CIA, but certainly the bad factions to propagate the populace
[3:53:16.820 --> 3:53:21.820]  without any legal consequence. And so if we want to see some good stuff happen in our
[3:53:21.820 --> 3:53:29.580]  country, we need a influx of truth. And we need these organizations, we need these mainstream
[3:53:29.580 --> 3:53:36.220]  media propagandists to be brought to heel. And that's that's good. I have plenty more
[3:53:36.220 --> 3:53:42.300]  thanks, Casey. Yeah, thanks, Casey. That's a good call. I think we have time for another
[3:53:42.300 --> 3:53:48.340]  one. David in Ohio has been waiting also for more than an hour. Go ahead, David. Yes,
[3:53:48.340 --> 3:53:56.380]  I study history, philosophy, religion, martial arts. And the situation, like you said, we
[3:53:56.380 --> 3:54:04.820]  don't know exactly the logistics or tactical, how this happened. We have some ideas. I think
[3:54:04.820 --> 3:54:13.780]  it's a big trap to catch Trump, to get him to put troops into Iran or start a conflict.
[3:54:13.780 --> 3:54:22.900]  And I do want to get to the main points. Because of our banking systems, the way they are,
[3:54:22.900 --> 3:54:28.220]  in essence, we really don't have self rules were under the thumb of the international
[3:54:28.220 --> 3:54:36.540]  banks. And until we get a movement where, you know, it's unconstitutional for us to
[3:54:36.540 --> 3:54:44.100]  have foreign foreign banks printing our money, private banks, it's in our constitution that
[3:54:44.100 --> 3:54:51.380]  only our government can do that. And I think everybody should everybody should read the
[3:54:51.380 --> 3:54:55.660]  creek that has not ever heard of it should read on Griffin's the creature from Jekyll
[3:54:55.660 --> 3:55:00.460]  Island about the creation of the Federal Reserve. It's one of the most important and
[3:55:00.460 --> 3:55:06.900]  eyeopening books anybody will ever read. Go ahead, David. Yes, the thing I wanted to say
[3:55:06.900 --> 3:55:12.820]  is not only should we be pushing for a national bank in the United States with currency backed
[3:55:12.820 --> 3:55:19.900]  by gold, but we should be pushing for this internationally. And the reason I say this
[3:55:19.900 --> 3:55:25.340]  for each country to have their own banks backed by gold is because every time we've had a
[3:55:25.340 --> 3:55:31.900]  president who's tried to get away from the international banks, go back to Lincoln, Garfield,
[3:55:31.900 --> 3:55:38.660]  McKinley, Kennedy, they all get assassinated. That's when it goes. Yeah, it's funny. It's
[3:55:38.660 --> 3:55:43.740]  funny how that happens. And just look at how the deep state came against Trump. I mean,
[3:55:43.740 --> 3:55:47.980]  because he's a disruptor, not saying it's strictly about banking, but that the whole
[3:55:47.980 --> 3:55:52.740]  banking angle, the global globalism, the deep state, it's all tied together. Or look
[3:55:52.740 --> 3:55:58.380]  at the Brits, Boris Johnson, and Brexit. They voted to get out. And even the so-called
[3:55:58.380 --> 3:56:05.540]  conservative MPs said, no, wait a minute. So it is, to a certain, well, to a great extent,
[3:56:05.540 --> 3:56:10.980]  like a fake sham democracy we have now. I know it's a republic, but I mean, our elections
[3:56:10.980 --> 3:56:15.980]  have become almost a sham. And that's why I have to give kudos to Trump, because at
[3:56:15.980 --> 3:56:20.460]  least he is really battling against the deep state. They did everything they could to elect
[3:56:20.460 --> 3:56:27.420]  Hillary and take him out. And he's still standing. And now in Britain, Boris Johnson
[3:56:27.420 --> 3:56:34.020]  is saying he's going to go hulk. He's going to go for a hard Brexit, come what may. But
[3:56:34.020 --> 3:56:40.820]  the globalists, the bankers, the multi-national corporations, they want to run the world.
[3:56:40.820 --> 3:56:49.300]  They don't want us national populists to have any say. They want us to be compliant worker
[3:56:49.300 --> 3:56:59.100]  factory drones and just take the Soma, the bread and the circuses, and just be compliant
[3:56:59.100 --> 3:57:04.820]  workers, watch our country flooded with third world immigration. And we'll all be leveled
[3:57:04.820 --> 3:57:13.580]  out at something like Guatemala or Brazil or Argentina. And none of us will have any
[3:57:13.580 --> 3:57:19.700]  real control over what's going on. But let's keep our eye on Iran. And I'm looking especially
[3:57:19.700 --> 3:57:26.540]  for forensic evidence. I'm looking for somebody to come out with little engine parts that
[3:57:26.540 --> 3:57:31.500]  have serial numbers on them. The Iranians did a really good job. There won't be any.
[3:57:31.500 --> 3:57:37.180]  They'll be sterile, as you say. All right. Not sure when I'll see you next, but thanks
[3:57:37.180 --> 3:57:43.860]  for being on Infowars and see you next time.
