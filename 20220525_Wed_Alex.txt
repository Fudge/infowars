[00:00.000 --> 00:26.620]  It's the United States, frail, confused, bitterly partisan, desecrating the memory of recently
[00:26.620 --> 00:31.640]  murdered children with tired talking points in the Democratic Party, dividing the country
[00:31.640 --> 00:37.600]  in a moment of deep pain rather than uniting, his voice rising amplified only as he repeats
[00:37.600 --> 00:42.280]  the talking points he repeated for over 35 years in the United States Senate, partisan
[00:42.280 --> 00:48.600]  politics being the only thing that animates him, unfit for leadership of this country.
[00:48.600 --> 00:52.160]  Will Kane is a man we trust, he often fills in on this show, he's also the host of Fox
[00:52.160 --> 00:53.160]  and Friends Weekend.
[00:53.160 --> 00:56.960]  Well Kane, what a moment this would have been if he had stopped a sentence in and said we're
[00:56.960 --> 01:01.520]  going to pray for these families and let's let this marinate for a minute, let's stand
[01:01.520 --> 01:06.400]  respectfully before a tragedy, and Joe Biden has lived tragedy, so he could say that was
[01:06.400 --> 01:07.400]  some credibility.
[01:07.400 --> 01:13.840]  He moved immediately into some DNC rant off a cue card, that's the president?
[01:13.840 --> 01:18.840]  What a moment this almost was, there a moment at the beginning of the speech, it sounded
[01:18.840 --> 01:23.880]  like he might bring this country together, talking about the loss inside someone when
[01:23.880 --> 01:29.080]  they lose a child, the hole that never will be filled, quoting scripture which is so important
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.200]  in this moment Tucker because what we're suffering from culturally is a rot of spirituality,
[01:34.200 --> 01:41.240]  a loss of meaning, and you're exactly right, he turns and gets animated when it's time
[01:41.240 --> 01:45.680]  to cast blame, when it's time to point fingers, when it's time to be partisan.
[01:45.680 --> 01:48.080]  You know he can't point to a single law that would have stopped the shooter because he
[01:48.080 --> 01:52.680]  doesn't know what the shooter did yet, what gun he used, he knows nothing about the details
[01:52.680 --> 01:57.880]  of this crime, and so therefore he knows not what law he could offer that would solve this
[01:57.880 --> 02:02.360]  crime, which reveals it was just simply partisanship, I've been listening to you tonight Tucker
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.960]  and I do share this sentiment with you, it's a true reflection of character and not limited
[02:06.960 --> 02:11.400]  to the president of the United States, if your first instinct is to turn to partisanship,
[02:11.400 --> 02:16.640]  if your first instinct is to blame those who disagree, you know I know you're probably
[02:16.640 --> 02:19.960]  familiar with this Tucker, David Foster Wallace gave an amazing speech once where he said
[02:19.960 --> 02:24.680]  you don't get a choice of whether or not to worship, you get a choice as to what you
[02:24.680 --> 02:30.800]  worship and what we are seeing people worship politics, and if that's the case they'll sacrifice
[02:30.800 --> 02:37.040]  anything for their own righteousness, for their own narcissism, for their own partisanship.
[02:37.040 --> 02:45.520]  I mean to stand before the image of murdered children and your first impulse is I can be
[02:45.520 --> 02:48.960]  more powerful if only leverage this in the right way, that's what the president of the
[02:48.960 --> 02:54.920]  United States, I'm in shock having seen the president of the United States call for more
[02:54.920 --> 02:56.880]  power for himself, that's his answer.
[02:56.880 --> 03:01.000]  Well the only reason I'm not in shock Tucker is I was around and so were you, when I saw
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.680]  Barack Obama stand on the graves of dead children as well, and so this was somewhat
[03:04.680 --> 03:08.480]  anticipatory, you could expect this would be what would happen, and again Tucker I've
[03:08.480 --> 03:12.680]  been listening to you tonight and you've been asking some important questions, for example
[03:12.680 --> 03:17.400]  I heard you ask Judge Pirro earlier in the show, do we study these things, do we study
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.120]  these shooters, how can we stop them in the future, you know in the 80's we put together
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.600]  the behavioral science unit at the FBI to stop serial killers, now these guys in these
[03:25.600 --> 03:30.280]  situations often kill themselves, we can see what makes them tick, we can do more, we can
[03:30.280 --> 03:35.400]  put money into protecting schools, we just gave $40 billion to Ukraine to protect and
[03:35.400 --> 03:39.800]  rebuild that country, we can't afford to protect our schools, we immediately put money into
[03:39.800 --> 03:44.280]  protecting schools from COVID, by the way much of it, which is not yet used, could be
[03:44.280 --> 03:49.160]  used to protecting schools, there are things we can do, but the most important thing Tucker
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.720]  is figure out what's going on culturally with this country, we are callous, we are partisan,
[03:54.720 --> 03:57.920]  we are not spiritual and we have lost meaning.
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.000]  I hope we will not let politicians leverage our grief to make them more powerful for their
[04:03.000 --> 04:13.960]  aggrandizement, it's really disgusting, I can say, Wilcane I appreciate your coming
[04:13.960 --> 04:14.960]  on today, thank you.
[04:14.960 --> 04:19.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today, I wanted to play that short
[04:19.800 --> 04:24.320]  clip from Tucker Carlson, I didn't see it until this morning and that was what I did
[04:24.320 --> 04:30.720]  to come in and say today, this is spiritual rot and we know the identity of the organization
[04:30.720 --> 04:36.200]  in the group that directed this young man that got caught in the snare of evil, and
[04:36.200 --> 04:42.800]  we are going to reveal the organization and group behind this attack in Uvalde, Texas
[04:42.800 --> 04:48.840]  on the other side of this quick break, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com tomorrow's news

[05:40.000 --> 05:43.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply and it's been sold out for months because

[05:49.160 --> 05:52.480]  than it goes back to full price, within two weeks the current sales rate is going to sell
[05:52.480 --> 05:53.480]  out.
[05:53.480 --> 06:00.480]  So experience X2 for yourself today at InfowarsTour.com, X2 at InfowarsTour.com, take action now.
[06:23.480 --> 06:28.880]  More like the son of Satan.
[06:28.880 --> 06:33.040]  Doesn't matter if they're Caucasian, doesn't matter if they're Hispanic.
[06:33.040 --> 06:35.880]  It doesn't matter if they are black.
[06:35.880 --> 06:45.160]  They all have that same look and they all follow the exact same MO.
[06:45.160 --> 06:48.800]  They all have the same criminology behind them.
[06:48.800 --> 06:53.400]  His friends say that he began to self harm several years ago, began to get into the occult,
[06:53.400 --> 06:57.640]  began to become a Satanist.
[06:57.640 --> 07:01.520]  And if you ask what organization or group was behind this or if he acted alone, he did
[07:01.520 --> 07:03.040]  not act alone.
[07:03.040 --> 07:08.520]  The Bible talks about the mystery of iniquity, the mystery of evil and how this evil force
[07:08.520 --> 07:12.400]  takes people over.
[07:12.400 --> 07:20.960]  And if you pull up the image of the famous night stalker, Mr. Ramirez looks just like
[07:20.960 --> 07:25.600]  him, just like him in the eyes, all of it.
[07:25.600 --> 07:31.680]  And the same look is in the eyes of Adam Lanza from Sandy Hook and the same look is in the
[07:31.680 --> 07:39.000]  eyes of Harris and Clybold from Columbine and they're into darkness.
[07:39.000 --> 07:40.560]  They're into black cloaks.
[07:40.560 --> 07:42.400]  They're into Satanism.
[07:42.400 --> 07:48.920]  They are into destroying innocence.
[07:48.920 --> 07:56.480]  And so he killed his grandmother, Mr. Romus, just like Adam Lanza killed his mother with
[07:56.480 --> 08:00.880]  the gun she'd gotten that he had illegally.
[08:00.880 --> 08:05.880]  And he went out to kill children, just like the left wants to abort the babies even after
[08:05.880 --> 08:09.800]  they're born and have passed laws in several states to do it.
[08:09.800 --> 08:14.560]  Just like they want to give us all these poison shots and injections, Bill Gates says, he
[08:14.560 --> 08:19.520]  wants to depopulate you, but he wants you to take these shots and he wants to be forced
[08:19.520 --> 08:21.520]  because he knows best.
[08:21.520 --> 08:27.360]  This is easier than even putting two plus two together and saying it equals four.
[08:27.360 --> 08:38.160]  It is prima facie, meaning on its face, that there is an epidemic of psychotic mass shooters
[08:38.160 --> 08:44.760]  because it didn't exist until what we saw with the tower shooting at UT back in the
[08:44.760 --> 08:50.800]  1960s with the Marine Corps sniper that they learned at the autopsy had half his brain
[08:50.800 --> 08:53.080]  was a tumor.
[08:53.080 --> 08:57.760]  And then all he knew was the training as a top marksman in the Marine Corps and became
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.680]  basically a robot, a demonic robot.
[09:02.680 --> 09:08.360]  And it's still extremely rare, only a few hundred people die in schools each year, more
[09:08.360 --> 09:10.040]  than half of that is gangbangers shooting each other.
[09:10.040 --> 09:12.920]  And when that happens, it doesn't even hit the news nationally.
[09:12.920 --> 09:19.000]  And there are mass shootings every weekend where five, 10, 15, 20 people get shot, get
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  killed.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.360]  Hell, you saw what happened in Las Vegas, but when that got connected to Saudi Arabia,
[09:25.360 --> 09:29.480]  you saw that disappear out of the news like flipping a light switch off.
[09:29.480 --> 09:30.880]  Biggest mass shooting in US history.
[09:30.880 --> 09:40.240]  So I'm stating the obvious here, but it is not the gun or the knife or the baseball bat
[09:40.240 --> 09:41.720]  that is killing these people.
[09:41.720 --> 09:43.320]  It is the evil minds.
[09:43.320 --> 09:48.600]  And so the headline today for the show is Alex Jones will exclusively reveal the organization
[09:48.600 --> 09:55.080]  in group behind this psychotic devil captured by darkness.
[09:55.080 --> 09:57.280]  And the name is Satan.
[09:57.280 --> 09:59.000]  That's the organization.
[09:59.000 --> 10:00.400]  That's the group.
[10:00.400 --> 10:01.400]  That's how this happens.
[10:01.400 --> 10:04.360]  And it's hard for people to believe this type of stuff goes on.
[10:04.360 --> 10:09.160]  But we have all these Democrat senators saying only in America does this happen.
[10:09.160 --> 10:16.400]  I have stacks of articles of over 150,000 killed in Mexico in just the last decade.
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.880]  Most of them shot, tortured, you name it, where they have no guns for the citizens.
[10:20.880 --> 10:24.800]  I have stacks of articles of higher crime rates and more people being shot and killed
[10:24.800 --> 10:26.080]  in Venezuela.
[10:26.080 --> 10:27.680]  And they have a total gun ban.
[10:27.680 --> 10:33.960]  And they also have something else like North Korea or Cuba, an authoritarian state that
[10:33.960 --> 10:40.200]  kills hundreds of thousands and millions in their prisons and in their dungeons.
[10:40.200 --> 10:45.680]  So you see the U.M. with all those armed guards and the World Economic Forum with 5,000 police
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.480]  and 5,000 troops and helicopters and submachine guns and journalists being detained, being
[10:51.480 --> 10:56.880]  harassed, covering their Geneva, Switzerland, world government event.
[10:56.880 --> 11:02.000]  Where they have armed guards outside their rooms.
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.120]  The press has reported on it that they have an armed guard at the front of each elevator
[11:07.120 --> 11:09.960]  and at the exit by the stairs.
[11:09.960 --> 11:13.440]  And there are at least two guards on every floor.
[11:13.440 --> 11:18.920]  And then they have private guards that are with the Debo scum sleeping in the hotel rooms
[11:18.920 --> 11:21.640]  right next to them, sometimes in the same suite.
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.920]  So they've got all the guns, all the weapons in the world.
[11:25.920 --> 11:32.040]  It's not bad when the globalists have guns, it's only bad when you have guns.
[11:32.040 --> 11:39.000]  And Mexico has never had a second amendment and in the last 50 years they've eradicated
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  civilian ownership of guns.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.840]  And Mexico also has a devil problem, a Satanism problem, just like we do.
[11:46.840 --> 11:53.120]  And if you go look at the gangs who are smuggling the kids, they worship the grim reaper.
[11:53.120 --> 11:55.480]  And they worship death and brutality.
[11:55.480 --> 12:01.720]  A tiny minority, but still dominating and destroying an entire amazing nation.
[12:01.720 --> 12:08.000]  And the same poison, the same sickness that is in Mexico and is in other countries around
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.320]  the world is here in the United States.
[12:14.320 --> 12:19.280]  They kill us with fentanyl by the millions, they kill us with poisoned shots by the millions,
[12:19.280 --> 12:27.520]  but they cover that all up and they focus in on this event and someone who reportedly
[12:27.520 --> 12:30.120]  killed his grandmother.
[12:30.120 --> 12:34.480]  The police were looking for him, the border patrol went after him, he shot at him, went
[12:34.480 --> 12:45.360]  into the building and quickly killed 19 people, 19 children, two teachers in an unprecedented
[12:45.360 --> 12:53.240]  attack and it was a brave, lone, a border patrol agent that before the backup got there
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.880]  and everybody put their body armor on and got suited up in their camo, who rushed in
[12:57.880 --> 13:03.080]  and got wounded but killed the son of a bitch and son of a bitch is too kind of term for
[13:03.080 --> 13:07.960]  somebody like this, but you have to understand whether you are the night stalker or whether
[13:07.960 --> 13:19.520]  you are Mr. Ramos, Ramos, it is the same evil, whether they're Hispanic, whether they're
[13:19.520 --> 13:24.400]  black, whether they're white and so when a white supremacist goes into a black grocery
[13:24.400 --> 13:31.160]  store and kills 10 people or when a Hispanic man goes in and kills a bunch of little children,
[13:31.160 --> 13:40.280]  mainly Hispanic children, it's satanic ladies and gentlemen and you're going to see more
[13:40.280 --> 13:47.760]  of that in a society unraveling and going into chaos, higher crime, imploding borders,
[13:47.760 --> 13:53.160]  inflation and what are the Democrats still pushing, defunding police departments between
[13:53.160 --> 13:58.600]  50 and 100 percent while the city councils have private armed security guards, they know
[13:58.600 --> 14:07.000]  exactly what they're doing and if he'd have done this in a elementary school in a leftist
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.280]  control area, he killed so many people so quickly, the police stopped him in minutes,
[14:13.280 --> 14:20.880]  this brave heroic border patrol agent, that if that officer hadn't gone in there and killed
[14:20.880 --> 14:27.240]  this monster, he could have killed hundreds of children and the argument is, well, they
[14:27.240 --> 14:30.720]  can't have a weapon that dispatches people so fast, you could go to a parade and run
[14:30.720 --> 14:38.040]  over hundreds of people, Muslims have killed 60, 70, 80, 100 plus people in one swath in
[14:38.040 --> 14:46.280]  places like Germany and France, you're going to ban the trucks, they've had cases in Japan
[14:46.280 --> 14:55.440]  and China where one man kills over 30 children, one case 36 a decade ago, another case 15
[14:55.440 --> 15:03.240]  just last year with butcher knives, are you going to take the butcher knives away?
[15:03.240 --> 15:08.800]  No ladies and gentlemen, the obvious answer is, a good guy stopped the bad guy with the
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.400]  gun and those of us that would never harm a child, those of us that would never harm
[15:13.400 --> 15:19.000]  anybody that didn't attack us, we need to be armed, damn it, and we need the teachers
[15:19.000 --> 15:27.520]  armed and we need the principals armed and if we got $40 billion to send money to Ukraine
[15:27.520 --> 15:36.520]  for money laundering and $5 billion a month more, we've got the money to have armed police
[15:36.520 --> 15:41.920]  in the schools and that is exactly what the Democrats are trying to stop, they want the
[15:41.920 --> 15:45.680]  police out of the schools and then they want to advertise for psychopathic demons, the
[15:45.680 --> 15:50.640]  option like on a menu, death by cop, suicide yourself, kill your grandma, kill your mom,
[15:50.640 --> 15:56.000]  no the big bonanza is, go shoot up an elementary school as they hype it, hype up Sandy Hook
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  all of it, they know what they're doing.
[15:58.000 --> 16:04.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of natural compounds out there that turbo charge and

[17:08.640 --> 17:12.920]  flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.

[20:00.280 --> 20:17.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.200 --> 20:23.920]  I told you over and over and over again hundreds of times in the last year and a half that
[20:23.920 --> 20:33.680]  as we approach the midterms now 167 days now that satanic demon-possessed sleeper cells
[20:33.680 --> 20:46.640]  would activate these portals to hell that Salvador Romas is and was killed by a valiant
[20:46.640 --> 20:52.720]  border patrol agent that didn't wait and charged right in and it's because of these
[20:52.720 --> 21:00.440]  type of demons commanded and led by the globalist spiritually that we have to stand up.
[21:00.440 --> 21:04.800]  Historians will tell you the founding fathers warned us that if we are not a moral people
[21:04.800 --> 21:12.000]  we cannot live in a free country and we are becoming more and more evil statistically
[21:12.000 --> 21:17.280]  and you can see it everywhere, I challenge anybody no matter where you live in the United
[21:17.280 --> 21:27.160]  States to go to a pro-abortion rally and you have never seen such disgusting hateful scum.
[21:27.160 --> 21:35.280]  Celebrating we love to kill kids, we love Satan, pro-pedophile flags, you've seen the
[21:35.280 --> 21:39.600]  demon possession, you've seen the videos we played, we're not cherry picking this ladies
[21:39.600 --> 21:44.280]  and gentlemen, you go point a camera at it even if they don't know that you're against
[21:44.280 --> 21:47.520]  them and they're flipping out and knowing nuts.
[21:47.520 --> 21:54.120]  They are celebrating, they are reveling in the blood of 65 million aborted children since
[21:54.120 --> 22:03.800]  Roe v. Wade in this country.
[22:03.800 --> 22:12.640]  This is a spiritual blight and you add, as I told Piers Morgan so many years ago, I
[22:12.640 --> 22:19.560]  guess it was 2013 in studio where they, there had been a gang of Indian men that had raped
[22:19.560 --> 22:27.120]  a group of women with steel bars and killed some of them and I said to Piers Morgan because
[22:27.120 --> 22:34.440]  Sandy Hook had just happened, I said you don't blame the crazy, the gun, you need to be blaming
[22:34.440 --> 22:40.320]  the crazy people that are on the psychotropics and in almost every case, these mass shooters
[22:40.320 --> 22:50.440]  are into the occult, they're into shoot them up video games, they are into death and they
[22:50.440 --> 22:57.000]  want to hurt children and the most important part is they are on serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
[22:57.000 --> 23:02.320]  that since the 1990s, because they had such a rash of deaths and mass murders, it says
[23:02.320 --> 23:09.760]  on the box of that entire class may cause you to commit mass murder, murder, suicide,
[23:09.760 --> 23:13.680]  megalomania, delusions of grandeur.
[23:13.680 --> 23:20.480]  Every time, a few years ago, an Asian man with no criminal record was in a Walmart and
[23:20.480 --> 23:23.560]  shot and killed a cop that came over because the guy was walking around half naked and
[23:23.560 --> 23:28.920]  the guy was on a bunch of psychotropic drugs and alcohol, the guy didn't know what he did,
[23:28.920 --> 23:34.960]  he was out of his mind, I'm not against shoot them up video games, a normal person plays
[23:34.960 --> 23:40.360]  them, it just makes you a better marksman, they're basically combat simulators, the Pentagon
[23:40.360 --> 23:46.960]  invented them in the 70s but you give it to somebody who's self-harming, taking drugs
[23:46.960 --> 23:53.600]  both prescription and illegal, who's isolated, who's been alone and who's been bullied like
[23:53.600 --> 23:59.200]  this individual reportedly was, it pushes them into wanting to become a friend of the darkness
[23:59.200 --> 24:08.160]  so they'll have power over other people and the FBI has a total profile on these individuals,
[24:08.160 --> 24:12.760]  they know exactly who they are and how they operate just like the white supremacist shooter
[24:12.760 --> 24:19.240]  was in to shoot them up games, into the occult, hated people, it was nihilistic, just a different
[24:19.240 --> 24:24.320]  flavor of the same thing and they knew he was planning it, he said he was going to attack
[24:24.320 --> 24:29.280]  a school, he said he was going to kill neighbors and the FBI and the state police knew and
[24:29.280 --> 24:33.080]  they could have taken his guns, they could have put him in a mental institution but they
[24:33.080 --> 24:40.520]  didn't do it, they let it happen again and listen, it's going to happen, we've got seven
[24:40.520 --> 24:45.480]  and a half billion people on this planet and I just read footnotes of New York Times years
[24:45.480 --> 24:50.760]  ago of an area in the Congo and it had been set aside for a U.N. carbon sink so they could
[24:50.760 --> 24:55.080]  have a mine over here so they had to like all this other land off use for humans including
[24:55.080 --> 24:58.880]  farming and so they went into ancestral lands, people have been there for thousands of years
[24:58.880 --> 25:04.080]  but didn't have deeds because they lived there forever, well how do you own this land, well
[25:04.080 --> 25:08.800]  my great great great great great grandfathers are all buried here, my grandmothers, the
[25:08.800 --> 25:14.600]  U.N. goes in and they just submit as a footnote and just exterminates with machine guns and
[25:14.600 --> 25:19.000]  tanks and helicopters, thousands of people in a tribe and it's just a footnote how the
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.320]  U.N. slaughtered everybody, they did the same thing in Burma, it's mainstream news they
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.440]  killed over 20,000 of the natives because the U.N. was making room for a corporation
[25:29.440 --> 25:37.600]  to come in there so they order lockdowns worldwide which still were going for two years, finally
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.720]  ended in areas of Africa and Latin America and Asia, causing total collapse like you're
[25:41.720 --> 25:47.800]  seeing in places like Sri Lanka and 40 extra million people died, there's no new numbers
[25:47.800 --> 25:52.440]  from the U.N. that's a seven, eight month old number, okay in the two years of the lockdown
[25:52.440 --> 25:59.400]  40 million extra starved to death, that's more than double the normal 15 million a year,
[25:59.400 --> 26:03.640]  40 million on top of 30 million that died over two years, so instead of 30 million dying
[26:03.640 --> 26:09.760]  in two years on average starvation, you had 40 million on that, 40 million dead people
[26:09.760 --> 26:14.880]  but they don't eulogize them, they don't talk about them, they don't humanize them,
[26:14.880 --> 26:21.160]  no they just let the third world collapse and starve and then flood us, so you think
[26:21.160 --> 26:28.080]  about that, India had lockdowns off and on for a year, they estimate tens of millions
[26:28.080 --> 26:31.720]  died there but the government didn't report it from malnutrition then you get a common
[26:31.720 --> 26:39.280]  cold and you die, lowers your immune system, these are real numbers, these are real things
[26:39.280 --> 26:46.880]  that happened, these are real things that are unfolding and so when Biden gets up there
[26:46.880 --> 26:51.480]  and blames the second amendment and blames the republican party and blames gun owners,
[26:51.480 --> 26:55.160]  he knows he's a fraud and he's reading off a script and no one's there to counter him,
[26:55.160 --> 27:02.600]  what about Mexico, it's got a homicide rate, triple Rs, even our worst cities are better,
[27:02.600 --> 27:07.960]  what about all these other countries where they're taking the guns, no, Biden and the
[27:07.960 --> 27:13.800]  rest of his yoke get up there and they say this only happens in America, Biden said it,
[27:13.800 --> 27:18.200]  bunch of other senators said it, we got the clips, we'll play them but I want to open
[27:18.200 --> 27:24.600]  the phones up for Texans and people in Uvaldi specifically go to the head of the line and
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.520]  for law enforcement, particularly in Texas but all over, you'll go to the head of the

[27:36.560 --> 27:39.600]  on hold, gotten better about going to your calls and moving quickly through them, or
[27:39.600 --> 27:46.320]  quicker than we used to, the toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539, we are talking
[27:46.320 --> 27:53.040]  about the spiritual decline, psychos targeting children as above so below, the globalist
[27:53.040 --> 27:57.000]  want to kill children, there's satanic minions want to kill children and this is a spiritual
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.240]  war, you agree with that, you disagree, how do we counter this and the Democrats are coming
[28:01.240 --> 28:05.760]  with a bunch of anti-terrorism bills that Schumer's introducing to take our guns, that's
[28:05.760 --> 28:18.040]  massive news, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX, now taking your calls on this Wednesday, May 25th,

[28:23.400 --> 28:30.920]  would activate, spiritual forces, principalities and powers would make their move and unleash
[28:30.920 --> 28:36.400]  their sleeper cells of satanist, and now you see it happening, what do you think the Nazis
[28:36.400 --> 28:40.000]  were, what do you think the communists are, what do you think the French Revolution was,
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.640]  this is satanic force being released to kill, steal and destroy, it's 100% real ladies and
[28:46.640 --> 28:50.800]  gentlemen, and that's what they don't put on the news is that almost all these people

[33:10.240 --> 33:34.400]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao Zedong took the guns, Hitler took the
[33:34.400 --> 33:43.440]  guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took
[33:43.440 --> 33:52.720]  the guns, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms, the republic will
[33:52.720 --> 34:14.960]  rise again when you attempt to take our guns, the answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening
[34:14.960 --> 34:23.400]  to the Alex Jones show.
[34:23.400 --> 34:47.120]  You know the number one cause of death is suicide now, because they give people suicide mass
[34:47.120 --> 34:55.100]  is
[34:55.100 --> 34:59.760]  about 74% of those were gang-related gangbangers shooting each other. You get
[34:59.760 --> 35:03.860]  three and a half to four thousand. How many people died from infections in hospitals?
[35:03.860 --> 35:08.640]  197,000. They just ask a second. That's right. How many gun murders were there in
[35:08.640 --> 35:12.740]  Britain? How many great white sharks? How many kill people every year but they're
[35:12.740 --> 35:16.140]  scared to swim? Right. How many gun murders were there in Britain? A very low
[35:16.140 --> 35:18.860]  amount. I already went over those statistics, you know? I was only a few
[35:18.860 --> 35:23.020]  hundred. No, no. How many gun murders? I actually actually did pull statistics. Here,
[35:23.020 --> 35:26.540]  let me pull them out right here. I figured you'd do that. Gun murders. Oh wait, UK
[35:26.540 --> 35:29.900]  violent crime, capital of Europe, London telegraph. Here, let me give you more. It's a
[35:29.900 --> 35:33.460]  quite simple question. Well, that's the oldest. They're very loud, man. No, no, that's the oldest.
[35:33.460 --> 35:37.540]  You make a lot of noise. To ask me some little factoid. So that's a little factoid.
[35:37.540 --> 35:42.580]  I already said earlier, England has a lot lower gun crime rate because it took
[35:42.580 --> 35:46.340]  all the guns. Exactly. But you've got hordes of people burning down cities
[35:46.340 --> 35:49.820]  and beating old women's brains out every day. What a ridiculous thing. They arrest
[35:49.820 --> 35:53.420]  people in England if they defend themselves. That's on record. My God,
[35:53.420 --> 35:56.820]  you've got a total police state. Everybody's fleeing that country because
[35:56.820 --> 36:01.700]  you've had to flee here, bud. Why don't you tell folks? Yeah, you fled here.
[36:01.700 --> 36:05.700]  Why don't you go back and face the charges with a hacking scandal? I'll answer this
[36:05.700 --> 36:09.700]  question. How many guns... Why did you get fired from the Daily Mirror for putting
[36:09.700 --> 36:13.740]  out fake stories? How many... You're a hatchet man of the New World Order. You're a
[36:13.740 --> 36:16.940]  hatchet man. And I want to say this right here. You think you're a tough guy?
[36:16.940 --> 36:20.980]  Well, help me back with a boxing ring in here. And I'll wear red, white, and blue
[36:20.980 --> 36:25.060]  and you can wear your Jolly Roger. Okay. You know what you... Let's try again. How
[36:25.060 --> 36:28.420]  many gun murders were there? Oh, you're gonna ban your fist now? In Britain last
[36:28.420 --> 36:34.220]  year. How many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pen? I already went over
[36:34.220 --> 36:37.660]  those statistics. Do you know the answer? No, I don't. You said hundreds. It's very
[36:37.660 --> 36:42.860]  low. You said hundreds. Yes. It's actually 35. Well, the point is you
[36:42.860 --> 36:47.700]  against 11,000. Do you understand the difference between 11,000 and 35? Yeah.
[36:47.700 --> 36:51.580]  England wants to ban knives now because tens of thousands are getting stabbed. But
[36:51.580 --> 36:55.060]  do you understand the difference between... The knife doesn't kill people. Do you
[36:55.060 --> 36:58.700]  understand... The gun doesn't kill people. Yes. Do you understand... Do you understand...
[36:58.700 --> 37:02.500]  Between 35... You're not gonna pull on America's heartstrings. They know your
[37:02.500 --> 37:06.700]  script. Okay? You're not gonna get our guns. By the way, you guys always say we
[37:06.700 --> 37:09.860]  just want to take the semi-autos. Okay? And all this other stuff on semi-autos
[37:09.860 --> 37:13.180]  aren't even... Rifles aren't even used, but in a fraction of the crimes, you can
[37:13.180 --> 37:17.860]  pull those numbers up. Okay? No, no, no. Hold on. Let me ask you one question. Which
[37:17.860 --> 37:23.140]  weapon was predominantly used in the Aurora movie theater shooting? M4 AR-15
[37:23.140 --> 37:27.420]  variants. So, it was a semi-automatic assault rifle. Again. Okay. But statistically, it's
[37:27.420 --> 37:32.660]  very, very low. That was... Do you agree it was the single biggest shooting in the
[37:32.660 --> 37:38.660]  history of America in terms of people hit by a shooter? Do you know that? No, I
[37:38.660 --> 37:42.220]  believe that there were others... No, no, it's... Some other shooters were about over 30. No, no.
[37:42.220 --> 37:45.660]  This was the single biggest mass shooting. Listen, you're just going...
[37:45.660 --> 37:49.620]  They're been bombings of Wall Street. Let me ask you a second question. Listen, why can't the
[37:49.620 --> 37:54.300]  pilots have firearms? We trust them to fly the planes. You've had a lot to say. No, my
[37:54.300 --> 37:58.580]  point is the second amendment is sacrosanct. And you're not getting it. Do you know
[37:58.580 --> 38:03.180]  which weapon was used in the Oregon shopping mall mass shooting recently? I
[38:03.180 --> 38:08.220]  understand that people who are mentally ill on all the serotonry have taken
[38:08.220 --> 38:11.940]  inhibitors who play these shoot-em-up games. Alex. Want to go out and do this? Because
[38:11.940 --> 38:15.660]  there's criminals, I don't lose my rights, Pierce. Alex. Alex. Alex. Because there's criminals, I
[38:15.660 --> 38:18.940]  don't lose my rights. Just answer the question. Yeah. Do you know what the weapon
[38:18.940 --> 38:23.660]  used was? Listen, let me ask you a question. No, no. I've got the FBI statistics that...
[38:23.660 --> 38:27.380]  Listen. That the so-called semi-automatic that you talk about. Let's take a break. Let me
[38:27.380 --> 38:31.540]  come back. Again, you're not gonna get the guns. When we come back, try and answer my
[38:31.540 --> 38:34.940]  question. Yeah, all you're gonna do is sit there and play little factoid questions.
[38:34.940 --> 38:40.780]  Overall crime has gone on over 20%. All right, folks. We are back live. I thought
[38:40.780 --> 38:45.100]  we'd play some of that because I continued to bring up the fact that
[38:45.100 --> 38:49.340]  almost every shooter is into the occult and is on these serotonry uptake
[38:49.340 --> 38:56.500]  inhibitors. And yes, because the media always advertises it's an AR-15, an M4,
[38:56.500 --> 39:02.660]  the loons all go out and follow. It's a well-known thing in crime and a well-known
[39:02.660 --> 39:08.340]  thing in criminology called copycats. This is not rocket science. They know
[39:08.340 --> 39:12.620]  exactly what's going on. They have the profiles of these people. They have all
[39:12.620 --> 39:16.980]  the warning signs and nothing's done. And a couple of these events happen a year.
[39:16.980 --> 39:21.180]  And then when they get more than a couple, it boom, boom, boom, boom, boom starts
[39:21.180 --> 39:27.980]  popping up because the copycatting. Other mentally ill crazy people see what's
[39:27.980 --> 39:32.820]  happening and it's absolutely confirmed in major studies. Everybody knows this.
[39:32.820 --> 39:37.340]  That when you give more news coverage to this and you give more attention to
[39:37.340 --> 39:41.100]  these people, they do it more. And I had the head producer, Scott, say to me
[39:41.100 --> 39:47.020]  last night, you know when we go cover this, it's gonna add to the whole thing.
[39:47.020 --> 39:51.420]  And I said, I know. And it's a very important psychological equation I have
[39:51.420 --> 39:55.020]  to engage in to understand that we have to counter them trying to take our guns.
[39:55.020 --> 40:00.660]  We have to counter the fact that it is an issue of the drugs and the
[40:00.660 --> 40:07.180]  MO of these people and the occultism and the loss of goodness in this culture and
[40:07.180 --> 40:11.940]  society. And so we're doing more good than we're doing harm. But when the mainstream
[40:11.940 --> 40:16.740]  media and the puppet president come out and absolutely hype this up and then
[40:16.740 --> 40:20.860]  beat the drum over and over again and talk about Sandy Hook ten years later
[40:20.860 --> 40:25.820]  every single day on every channel, mentally ill people here, Adam Lanza,
[40:25.820 --> 40:32.420]  AR-15, elementary school, elementary school, AR-15, and that's then how they
[40:32.420 --> 40:38.340]  activate. Oh, he's being chased by police. He just killed grandma. May
[40:38.340 --> 40:44.420]  I've been going to that school? We know he went to that school previously and he
[40:44.420 --> 40:52.540]  runs in there to kill children. A frothing, demonic, piranha-like creature
[40:52.540 --> 40:58.460]  going directly after those innocent children. And who else goes after innocent
[40:58.460 --> 41:02.540]  children? Who wants to sexualize them and legalize pedophilia? Who wants to abort
[41:02.540 --> 41:05.580]  it as many of them as they can and now kill them after they're born? Who wants
[41:05.580 --> 41:11.500]  to destroy their innocence? The globalist, ladies and gentlemen. They're the evil ones.
[41:11.500 --> 41:17.060]  They set the precedent. The fish rots from the head. We're gonna go to break
[41:17.060 --> 41:21.220]  here in about two minutes. We're gonna come back and talk to Doc, Rico, Daniel, Mike,
[41:21.220 --> 41:26.140]  and others. We're specifically taking calls from people in Yuval Day, people from
[41:26.140 --> 41:29.780]  Yuval Day, and I'd like to get law enforcement to call in and we'll get
[41:29.780 --> 41:33.340]  right to your call as well when we come back and give us your quick snapshot
[41:33.340 --> 41:36.780]  take on this and make any points that you want to make. We're gonna walk through
[41:36.780 --> 41:40.420]  all of it today and take your calls but also I'm gonna be covering some next
[41:40.420 --> 41:44.380]  hour. The latest on the Davos group now meeting in Geneva with world government
[41:44.380 --> 41:48.420]  being announced. All the censorship. George Soros saying the end of the world
[41:48.420 --> 41:53.540]  could happen over Ukraine while his policies push us towards that. How the
[41:53.540 --> 41:58.660]  FBI HQ, Hamstrung, the Alpha Bank investigation and tried to cover up the
[41:58.660 --> 42:03.620]  fact that Hillary made all this up to try to discredit and then impeach Trump
[42:03.620 --> 42:09.300]  which they ended up doing on the whole Ukraine fraud but he wasn't removed. This
[42:09.300 --> 42:14.420]  is just such an incredible time to be alive. We've also got big election
[42:14.420 --> 42:19.940]  primary news on what unfolded there. Marjorie Taylor Greene overcomes haters
[42:19.940 --> 42:26.220]  wins Republican primary. Yes, more good news. Herschel Walker is projected to win
[42:26.220 --> 42:33.220]  the GOP primary for Senate in Georgia. Sarah Sanders crushes gubernatorial
[42:33.220 --> 42:38.540]  opponent in Arkansas GOP primary. More good news. We're gonna be looking at a
[42:38.540 --> 42:43.260]  lot of that coming up today as well but I promise when we come out of this break
[42:43.260 --> 42:48.460]  I'm going right to your phone calls right through the next hour. There's a

[45:03.260 --> 45:08.140]  still unaware there's a war between three individuals and nation states on
[45:08.140 --> 45:12.420]  one side and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a
[45:12.420 --> 45:16.820]  post-human world. From the United States to Brazil and of course triggered by the
[45:16.820 --> 45:21.140]  Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist
[45:21.140 --> 45:24.900]  world government. That's why they launched their Great Reset and their
[45:24.900 --> 45:30.620]  program after collapsing us of Build Back Better. This is nothing more than a
[45:30.620 --> 45:36.180]  top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take
[45:36.180 --> 45:40.500]  our guns and because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology
[45:40.500 --> 45:45.220]  of this world government system could win, they released a biological weapon
[45:45.220 --> 45:49.900]  on us. Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[45:49.900 --> 45:53.540]  It's that simple. They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns
[45:53.540 --> 45:57.780]  so the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest of
[45:57.780 --> 46:01.940]  history. Expose this paradigm and we win. I want to thank all of you over the
[46:01.940 --> 46:04.940]  years who have supported Infowars financially with word of mouth and

[47:04.060 --> 47:08.620]  World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[47:34.060 --> 47:47.620]  America and the World is in a crisis of the soul. A crisis of the spirit, a war
[47:47.620 --> 47:55.340]  for our very eternal existence. I'm gonna go to your phone calls right now. We have
[47:55.340 --> 47:59.500]  this terrible event, another devil worshiper, another person to shoot them
[47:59.500 --> 48:05.860]  up games, another person who killed his grandmother reportedly and then went and
[48:05.860 --> 48:13.780]  did this terrible thing. And now we are all told we are collectively to blame for
[48:13.780 --> 48:22.900]  what this devil did. But I want you to think for a moment, gun owners are not
[48:22.900 --> 48:27.260]  collectively to blame. That Border Patrol agent that valiantly went in and
[48:27.260 --> 48:31.460]  stopped what was happening and got wounded himself. Is it to blame? He's the
[48:31.460 --> 48:38.220]  good guy. And you're good. You didn't do this. But we are to blame for letting
[48:38.220 --> 48:44.300]  society become this demonic. And I'm to blame too. And let's just admit that. And
[48:44.300 --> 48:48.860]  God's angry about it. But you can't have the Democratic Party over here
[48:48.860 --> 48:53.620]  shangers too many people, euthanize the old people. These are their policies. Kill
[48:53.620 --> 48:59.180]  the unborn, kill babies after they're born, harvest their organs, sexualize the
[48:59.180 --> 49:05.020]  children, defund the police, allow all the open air drug markets, allow massive
[49:05.020 --> 49:09.500]  human smuggling of children across the border, Senate report, tens of thousands
[49:09.500 --> 49:16.980]  in sex slavery many killed. And then you can't then point your finger as the real
[49:16.980 --> 49:23.900]  cancer. That is the Democrat Party, deep state controlled system. And tell us
[49:23.900 --> 49:27.460]  where to blame. And we're not going to take it. And we're not going to be
[49:27.460 --> 49:29.500]  defeated by you and you're not going to get our guns. I'm gonna go to your
[49:29.500 --> 49:33.660]  calls. The next hour, Chuckie Schumer is introducing a anti terror bill to go
[49:33.660 --> 49:37.460]  after the guns. We're trying to issue a national gun registry. We started
[49:37.460 --> 49:40.100]  having place that they want to be able to use now. They've had it illegally
[49:40.100 --> 49:43.500]  operating. That's come out in the nose years ago. Confirmed again this year.
[49:43.500 --> 49:49.260]  It's unbelievable. And they knew and they stood down yet again and it made me
[49:49.260 --> 49:52.420]  think about and we'll go to your calls Parkland a few years ago, David Hogg,
[49:52.420 --> 49:59.060]  all that. It was reported by the young people, including two guests we had on
[49:59.060 --> 50:02.980]  that were enrolled at that school that the we reported this the day of the
[50:02.980 --> 50:09.580]  event the day after we broke this and it made CNN so angry that the police
[50:09.580 --> 50:13.660]  stood there for at least 14 minutes standing there and then video was later
[50:13.660 --> 50:17.420]  released of them standing around the school while the shooting was going on
[50:17.420 --> 50:22.500]  inside a bunch of leftist cops that didn't care and that were not rushing
[50:22.500 --> 50:29.260]  in. And that's disgusting. So they want to take our guns and they want to sit
[50:29.260 --> 50:34.980]  there. He's leftist controlled cities with leftist police while our children
[50:34.980 --> 50:40.260]  are killed and while they don't do their job, while they also want to take our
[50:40.260 --> 50:46.900]  guns. Think about that. The videos are being released of him now. There was
[50:46.900 --> 50:56.260]  security there. They did exchange fire with him. They got wounded. It's
[50:56.260 --> 51:01.620]  unbelievable. Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls. I appreciate you
[51:01.620 --> 51:06.140]  calling. I appreciate you holding. Doc is calling from Oklahoma, but it's from
[51:06.140 --> 51:10.380]  Uvalde, where Matthew McConaughey's from. Some of the people I've hunted down
[51:10.380 --> 51:14.460]  there. That's down George Strait country down there. A lot of great people down
[51:14.460 --> 51:18.420]  there and it's very, very sad and our hearts go out to all of them. Doc in
[51:18.420 --> 51:23.900]  Oklahoma, go ahead. You're on the air. Hey, Alex. Good talk to you. Good talk to
[51:23.900 --> 51:30.100]  you, brother. What's your view on this? Well, for one thing, I grew up out
[51:30.100 --> 51:37.060]  there. I thought concealed handgun in that area for 10 years probably. There's a
[51:37.060 --> 51:43.700]  lot of people down there that have guns. My first thought was, were some of my
[51:43.700 --> 51:50.460]  people involved in that? And I still don't know. I know I trained, I don't know,
[51:50.460 --> 51:55.460]  1,500, 2,000 people around there. I know a lot of people that are teachers there
[51:55.460 --> 52:01.940]  and they should all be armed. They should all be armed. The greatest
[52:01.940 --> 52:08.380]  populations I thought were teachers, preachers and doctors. That's right.
[52:08.380 --> 52:14.220]  There should be instant access pistol safes that you can open in
[52:14.220 --> 52:18.140]  two seconds so that young people can't get to the guns. They're secure. There
[52:18.140 --> 52:24.260]  should be instant access pistol safes in every one of those classrooms and the
[52:24.260 --> 52:29.820]  teachers should be given training and basic defense and they should be put
[52:29.820 --> 52:35.540]  through the active shooter police training that only takes a few
[52:35.540 --> 52:40.820]  weekends to have the basic thing and it needs to be done. Absolutely. And there's
[52:40.820 --> 52:46.220]  a secondary problem here, Alex, is with Corona and everything that's gone on for
[52:46.220 --> 52:55.340]  the past two years. There has been a creation of this mindset of distress and
[52:55.340 --> 53:00.500]  people are just beaten down. And what it's done is it's created an environment
[53:00.500 --> 53:08.060]  for Northwood type events to create organically. I mean, you can call them
[53:08.060 --> 53:15.500]  copycat events, but they have an organic environment now due to the
[53:15.500 --> 53:19.820]  mindset of people and there's nothing you can do about it. That's right. They
[53:19.820 --> 53:24.540]  don't need to mind control somebody in a CIA laboratory, which they declassified
[53:24.540 --> 53:28.220]  they did to create mass shooters in the 50s, 60s and 70s. That's all declassified
[53:28.220 --> 53:32.620]  Ewing Cameron, Jolly and Wes and others. That's history channel shows about that.
[53:32.620 --> 53:37.180]  Look it up, folks. Our Theodore Kaczynski was in a CIA MK Ultra program, the
[53:37.180 --> 53:43.460]  Unabomber. That's L.A. Times, came out as court case, confirmed. They have created a
[53:43.460 --> 53:48.100]  whole environment with the culture where we're all in a giant mind control
[53:48.100 --> 53:52.100]  operation that they admitted they use Pentagon mind control to scare people of
[53:52.100 --> 53:56.740]  COVID. And the same thing was done in England and Canada and in Europe. So
[53:56.740 --> 54:04.100]  it's a unified mass open air brainwashing camp. Exactly. That's exactly
[54:04.100 --> 54:10.660]  what it is. All right. God bless you, Doc. Thank you so much for calling in. All
[54:10.660 --> 54:17.780]  right. I don't want to cut Matthew short. Well, they have to hold him over. Says
[54:17.780 --> 54:23.620]  there's a special ed teacher worked with the student and it says he was special
[54:23.620 --> 54:27.860]  ed says he had a learning disability and speech impediment people made fun of.
[54:27.860 --> 54:30.900]  That's what his friends are saying that they hadn't talked to him over a year
[54:30.900 --> 54:37.380]  because he got so demonic. But let's go to Matthew in Texas. Matthew, if you are
[54:37.380 --> 54:41.700]  who you say you are, this is a big break here on the show to be able to hear from
[54:41.700 --> 54:50.820]  you. And I believe you. But please tell us the details. All right. I'm a long time
[54:50.820 --> 55:02.820]  with Sir Alex. This is really hard for me to digest all this going on. I've
[55:02.820 --> 55:06.820]  worked with students like that across the state. You know, I've been employed in
[55:06.820 --> 55:12.100]  over 14 different districts. And I've seen this kind of from one end to the
[55:12.100 --> 55:17.540]  other. And whenever we, in my opinion, you know, and you're talking about an
[55:17.540 --> 55:24.580]  awesome group of people in Uvalde, Texas, great district, great people. My heart
[55:24.580 --> 55:28.020]  breaks for them and for those kids. You know, I've been a teacher for a long
[55:28.020 --> 55:34.820]  time. And I just want to say that, you know, we work with these kids. We know
[55:34.820 --> 55:40.420]  who they are, right? And whenever we went to quarantine, and it happened all over
[55:40.420 --> 55:47.300]  this country, a lot of these kids went down a bad path. And I think that's what
[55:47.300 --> 55:51.140]  we're seeing, right? I want to be specific. Did you work with this student or you
[55:51.140 --> 55:55.860]  worked with similar students and saw them fall out and then get swallowed up by
[55:55.860 --> 55:59.860]  the Internet? Or what are you saying? No, I interacted with them.
[55:59.860 --> 56:05.540]  And please, please hold. We got to go to break. Will you hold for like five
[56:05.540 --> 56:07.780]  minutes so we can come to you when the full audience is here in the second
[56:07.780 --> 56:12.020]  hour? Yes, sir. All right, great. Some say you don't care the first five minutes.
[56:12.020 --> 56:15.060]  So I'm going to have you hold. We'll come right back to you at six after.
[56:15.060 --> 56:18.820]  Please don't hang up, Matthew. You can tell this guy's for real. Wow.
[56:18.820 --> 56:21.540]  By the way, I had to put him on hold because if we don't do this, we won't be
[56:21.540 --> 56:25.460]  here. We are barely in the black, even with that big donation. Turn out we had
[56:25.460 --> 56:29.380]  even more bills I didn't know about, not mad at accounting, but we were like two,
[56:29.380 --> 56:32.580]  three months behind on some of the bandwidth bills. Just paid a half million
[56:32.580 --> 56:35.940]  dollar bandwidth bill because Bandai video is so successful, millions and
[56:35.940 --> 56:38.820]  millions and millions of views a day. That's what we built it for. It's what
[56:38.820 --> 56:42.660]  we did it for. We may have to lower the res quality or something or make the
[56:42.660 --> 56:45.620]  video's downloads or something because we're just running out of money.
[56:45.620 --> 56:49.060]  We're victims of our own success. So please help us sponsor getting the truth
[56:49.060 --> 56:52.580]  out, not just with our show and not just special reports, Greg Reese and
[56:52.580 --> 56:56.580]  Darren McGrane, everybody else, John Ballon, the list goes on and on, but
[56:56.580 --> 56:59.460]  all the other hundreds of contributors that have been banned and censored that
[56:59.460 --> 57:05.060]  are now at Band.video, we need to sell t-shirts and books and supplements
[57:05.060 --> 57:10.180]  and air filtration and water filtration. We'd be able to sell a lot of products
[57:10.180 --> 57:15.620]  at infowarstore.com to be able to stay on air. Plus these are great products.
[57:15.620 --> 57:18.900]  And I said I would end the sale yesterday, but I got busy after this mass
[57:18.900 --> 57:21.620]  shooting. We came in last night to the live show. I didn't come up with new
[57:21.620 --> 57:26.180]  specials. Inventory's low. So we're extending the sale one more day of X2
[57:26.180 --> 57:29.940]  40% off with Ultra 12. They're both amazing. Get them together 40% off, get

[58:55.060 --> 58:59.540]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has
[58:59.540 --> 59:03.860]  been Patriot Apparel so we can identify each other so we can spread the word
[59:03.860 --> 59:08.180]  and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com so they can understand
[59:08.180 --> 59:11.700]  the globalist plan and how to stop it. Now ladies and gentlemen, two months ago
[59:11.700 --> 59:15.060]  we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts, some of which
[59:15.060 --> 59:18.500]  go back more than 25 years. All these shirts are limited edition. They are
[59:18.500 --> 59:23.460]  about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[59:23.460 --> 59:26.980]  So there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[59:26.980 --> 59:30.260]  In a couple weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history. We're selling them
[59:30.260 --> 59:36.100]  all at cost at infowarstore.com. So thank you all for your support.
[59:36.100 --> 59:39.780]  Please visit infowarstore.com and get one of these historic
[59:39.780 --> 59:43.860]  shirts, hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[59:43.860 --> 59:48.100]  I want to thank you all for your support infowarstore.com.
[59:52.100 --> 59:56.100]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:03.860 --> 1:00:07.700]  All right, we have a man on the line from Texas who says that he was a special ed
[1:00:07.700 --> 1:00:12.820]  teacher at New Salvador, Romas. We're going to air a very important
[1:00:12.820 --> 1:00:15.940]  special report. We're going to premiere here at Greg Reese.
[1:00:15.940 --> 1:00:18.900]  The truth about Monkey Pox, it's also a band-aute video. It's so important that
[1:00:18.900 --> 1:00:22.180]  we're going to come right back at six seven. We're going to go right to Matthew,
[1:00:22.180 --> 1:00:27.220]  Patty, Tom, Rico, and many, many others. Danielle, Mike, we're getting to all of
[1:00:27.220 --> 1:00:30.180]  you, but here's the report.
[1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:41.380]  The main weapon being deployed against us, the would-be new world order, is slight
[1:00:41.380 --> 1:00:47.940]  of hand, distraction, and fakery. And we can see its effectiveness in the
[1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:52.980]  recent Johnny Depp trial. Meaningless drivel to feed humanity
[1:00:52.980 --> 1:00:58.180]  while we are literally being killed by criminal gangs posing as governments.
[1:00:58.180 --> 1:01:02.180]  And almost everybody takes a bite. As a human being,
[1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:08.580]  one must always factor in the tendency to be fooled and focus on what we know.
[1:01:08.580 --> 1:01:12.980]  And so what do we know so far about Monkey Pox?
[1:01:12.980 --> 1:01:17.060]  We know that after Bill Gates warned of an impending terrorist attack
[1:01:17.060 --> 1:01:22.980]  involving a synthetic ballpox in 2017, two new Monkey Pox vaccines were
[1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:29.460]  developed. Both admittedly dangerous, known to cause infection, vaccine shedding,
[1:01:29.460 --> 1:01:33.540]  and death. And both have been approved by the FDA.
[1:01:33.540 --> 1:01:37.620]  And we know that they have been planning for a Monkey Pox outbreak,
[1:01:37.620 --> 1:01:44.660]  just as the event 201 simulation war-gamed COVID-19 the year prior, or as Bill Gates
[1:01:44.660 --> 1:01:49.060]  calls it, germ-gamed. In the spring of last year, the U.S.
[1:01:49.060 --> 1:01:53.620]  held a Monkey Pox pandemic simulation exercise with the non-profit
[1:01:53.620 --> 1:01:57.060]  nuclear threat initiative that predicted a Monkey Pox
[1:01:57.060 --> 1:02:02.660]  bioattack in June of this year. During that same time, the U.K.
[1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:07.620]  Ministry of Defense simulated a Monkey Pox outbreak, focusing on
[1:02:07.620 --> 1:02:12.580]  Russian disinfo. And what do we know about Monkey Pox?
[1:02:12.580 --> 1:02:18.260]  Monkey Pox was first discovered in 1958 within colonies of laboratory
[1:02:18.260 --> 1:02:22.500]  research monkeys who were being given the polio vaccine.
[1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:27.380]  And according to the CDC, the only symptom that distinguishes Monkey Pox
[1:02:27.380 --> 1:02:33.140]  from smallpox is lymphadenopathy, swollen lymph nodes, which is also
[1:02:33.140 --> 1:02:38.500]  a smallpox vaccine side effect, and is known to be a symptom of smallpox,
[1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:42.100]  as well as chickenpox. Electron microscope
[1:02:42.100 --> 1:02:46.020]  visualization cannot prove a smallpox infection
[1:02:46.020 --> 1:02:50.740]  because allpox viruses are morphologically indistinguishable.
[1:02:50.740 --> 1:02:55.460]  According to actual science, there is a strong argument that smallpox,
[1:02:55.460 --> 1:03:00.740]  monkeypox, chickenpox, and shingles are all the same thing, and there is no
[1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:05.940]  actual proof that they are different. We are simply expected to trust the CDC
[1:03:05.940 --> 1:03:10.020]  and their logical fallacies as so-called evidence.
[1:03:10.020 --> 1:03:15.380]  And so in 1958, when virologists were likely seeing side effects on lab
[1:03:15.380 --> 1:03:18.740]  monkeys they were injecting with experimental vaccines,
[1:03:18.740 --> 1:03:23.300]  they called it Monkey Pox and claimed it was an ancient rare virus
[1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:26.820]  that they had just discovered, which coincidentally
[1:03:26.820 --> 1:03:30.660]  showed up in humans for the first time in 1970.
[1:03:30.660 --> 1:03:34.980]  And by 1978, without any proof of its existence,
[1:03:34.980 --> 1:03:38.820]  scientific journals were already saying that vaccination
[1:03:38.820 --> 1:03:43.300]  is an effective preventative measure against Monkey Pox.
[1:03:43.300 --> 1:03:49.460]  Just three months ago, the famous Wuhan lab, who allegedly created COVID-19,
[1:03:49.460 --> 1:03:54.340]  published a paper claiming they assembled a Monkey Pox virus genome,
[1:03:54.340 --> 1:03:57.780]  which will enable for successful PCR testing,
[1:03:57.780 --> 1:04:03.860]  and potentially make it more contagious. And so, just as the PCR tests
[1:04:03.860 --> 1:04:08.340]  were used to create false positives by misreading the flu,
[1:04:08.340 --> 1:04:12.660]  the common cold, and even fruit as COVID-19,
[1:04:12.660 --> 1:04:17.140]  they will now be used to create false positives for Monkey Pox,
[1:04:17.140 --> 1:04:20.100]  whether you are experiencing vaccine side effects,
[1:04:20.100 --> 1:04:25.220]  or common herpes, or even asymptomatic Monkey Pox.
[1:04:25.220 --> 1:04:29.380]  And finally, we know that the media is the real virus,
[1:04:29.380 --> 1:04:33.140]  and when the media puts out the fear, their followers
[1:04:33.140 --> 1:04:36.980]  will eagerly line up to get the new dangerous vaccines
[1:04:36.980 --> 1:04:40.100]  and insist that you do the same.
[1:04:40.100 --> 1:04:43.300]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:45.620]  All of his reports are groundbreaking,
[1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:48.020]  but that one is stunningly important to show,
[1:04:48.020 --> 1:04:49.620]  and they can just claim anything they want,
[1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:51.860]  is this Monkey Pox. You create all this fear,
[1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:54.340]  and they give us a shot that actually gives it to us.
[1:04:54.340 --> 1:04:59.460]  It's all documented. We'll be right back.
[1:04:59.460 --> 1:05:03.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of natural compounds out there
[1:05:03.380 --> 1:05:06.980]  that turbocharge and boost our stamina, our energy,
[1:05:06.980 --> 1:05:10.820]  our libido, that are also amazing pre or post workouts.
[1:05:10.820 --> 1:05:12.660]  And we went out and looked at the top brands,
[1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:15.860]  the top reviews, and came out with alpha power.
[1:05:15.860 --> 1:05:18.980]  Now, it's so hard to source good, clean herbs,
[1:05:18.980 --> 1:05:21.140]  like we have in this, that it's been sold out

[1:06:08.740 --> 1:06:12.820]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[1:06:12.820 --> 1:06:17.460]  of the info war.
[1:06:17.460 --> 1:06:20.020]  At the end of the first hour, if you just joined us,
[1:06:20.020 --> 1:06:22.180]  we went to a caller. We're opening the phones up
[1:06:22.180 --> 1:06:24.660]  for people specifically in Texas or Ubaldi,
[1:06:24.660 --> 1:06:28.260]  or from those in the school, and the caller sounds very credible
[1:06:28.260 --> 1:06:31.860]  and very informed and said,
[1:06:31.860 --> 1:06:36.420]  look, I'm a special ed teacher. I worked with him.
[1:06:36.420 --> 1:06:40.740]  And what he's talking about fits the MO. We're going right back to him now
[1:06:40.740 --> 1:06:48.580]  of accelerated suicide and violent actions and
[1:06:48.580 --> 1:06:53.140]  family violence, domestic violence of special ed students,
[1:06:53.140 --> 1:06:57.140]  particularly boys, during the last two years,
[1:06:57.140 --> 1:06:59.940]  with many of the schools closed for most of that time,
[1:06:59.940 --> 1:07:04.500]  and that people that were doing okay with loving folks around them,
[1:07:04.500 --> 1:07:07.780]  protecting them from bullies and giving them confidence
[1:07:07.780 --> 1:07:11.780]  and giving them love, that they were getting better,
[1:07:11.780 --> 1:07:17.140]  but now the statistics show us that it's producing more of these type people.
[1:07:17.140 --> 1:07:20.900]  And I'm all for freedom of speech and I'm all for the internet being wide open,
[1:07:20.900 --> 1:07:23.860]  while while West. But you have to know, and there's a lot of
[1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:28.500]  research now online into this, that this guy and other people
[1:07:28.500 --> 1:07:34.340]  get in these really sick communities where people use psychology to manipulate
[1:07:34.340 --> 1:07:38.500]  young handicapped individuals like this man who has teaching pediment,
[1:07:38.500 --> 1:07:41.140]  probably autistic from what his friends were saying,
[1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:44.900]  and obviously the caller can fill us in on that and I'll get more into the MO
[1:07:44.900 --> 1:07:48.980]  and the criminology of this, but it just fits the same pattern,
[1:07:48.980 --> 1:07:52.260]  just like Cruz at Parkland, and the police stood down there,
[1:07:52.260 --> 1:07:57.220]  they didn't stand down here, and Harris and Clybold and so many others,
[1:07:57.220 --> 1:08:01.300]  and then they kill their mother, they kill their parents,
[1:08:01.300 --> 1:08:04.900]  they kill their grandmother in the case of Ramos.
[1:08:04.900 --> 1:08:08.500]  And if I'm saying it two ways, the media's not sure, it's like,
[1:08:08.500 --> 1:08:12.100]  Ramos, Ramos, or they're saying it two different ways,
[1:08:12.100 --> 1:08:15.940]  two different spellings, and I'm sure soon we'll find out the actual spelling,
[1:08:15.940 --> 1:08:23.620]  but instead of an R-A, it's an R-O, but this is just a canary in the coal mine
[1:08:23.620 --> 1:08:27.620]  of what's happening, and the military, 25 suicides a day, double what it was 10
[1:08:27.620 --> 1:08:30.420]  years ago, and getting worse, well they don't kill their families,
[1:08:30.420 --> 1:08:33.780]  they just kill themselves, what is happening to these men
[1:08:33.780 --> 1:08:38.660]  particularly, and we do need a mental health solution to that,
[1:08:38.660 --> 1:08:42.260]  and obviously communities, not the federal government or the FBI or the
[1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:46.260]  National Guard, like the Democrats want, but local communities should
[1:08:46.260 --> 1:08:50.100]  really monitor in a loving way people like this,
[1:08:50.100 --> 1:08:54.180]  or they turn in to the Adam Lanzas of the world,
[1:08:54.180 --> 1:08:57.860]  and so I'm not against shooting up video games for normal people,
[1:08:57.860 --> 1:09:01.620]  but for people that live in La La Land, it becomes their real reality,
[1:09:01.620 --> 1:09:05.140]  and that's the picture that's emerging. So Matthew, thanks for holding us
[1:09:05.140 --> 1:09:08.980]  and staying over to tell us, I'm going to try to now be signed up for the rest of
[1:09:08.980 --> 1:09:12.660]  the segment, and then go to collars in the next segment, but just start wherever
[1:09:12.660 --> 1:09:16.500]  you like, and tell us what you witnessed and what you saw.
[1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:23.220]  Yes sir, to kind of preset this, I've got, I studied special education in
[1:09:23.220 --> 1:09:26.580]  graduate school in Texas, I'll probably get demonized from that,
[1:09:26.580 --> 1:09:30.260]  because now I'm an open and forward listener,
[1:09:30.260 --> 1:09:34.740]  I've been that way a long time, I haven't always agreed with everything you say
[1:09:34.740 --> 1:09:42.180]  Alex, but I do respect you, and so long story short,
[1:09:42.180 --> 1:09:48.180]  those kids had hope, right, whenever the economy was good,
[1:09:48.180 --> 1:09:51.700]  and you have to understand people in these alleys don't have very much,
[1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:55.940]  and what they do have, they're proud, they're very warm people,
[1:09:55.940 --> 1:10:00.340]  they're just good people, and so basically what happens is when that
[1:10:00.340 --> 1:10:04.260]  pandemic starts, a lot of these kids that needed
[1:10:04.260 --> 1:10:07.780]  our direction and our structure lost it,
[1:10:07.780 --> 1:10:12.900]  because they weren't there with us, and there's a lot of good teachers out there
[1:10:12.900 --> 1:10:18.660]  that care, and our school systems are crumbling,
[1:10:18.660 --> 1:10:25.940]  and it's sad to watch, and that's, you know, it's
[1:10:25.940 --> 1:10:29.380]  really, it's hard for me to even talk about it,
[1:10:29.380 --> 1:10:34.500]  because when you're really in it for those kids, it's just a very difficult
[1:10:34.500 --> 1:10:37.620]  thing to accept something like this happens,
[1:10:37.620 --> 1:10:40.660]  and I can only imagine what those teachers, some of them, a lot of them are
[1:10:40.660 --> 1:10:44.340]  friends of mine still in that district, are feeling right now,
[1:10:44.340 --> 1:10:48.660]  and so, you know, I'm a second amendment person,
[1:10:48.660 --> 1:10:53.780]  I served in the infantry, I've lived in Texas small life,
[1:10:53.780 --> 1:10:59.940]  I've found that area, I grew up with guns, I was trained and taught, you know, I
[1:10:59.940 --> 1:11:03.140]  went to hunter education, I was a kid and I was trained and taught
[1:11:03.140 --> 1:11:08.020]  to be responsible with them, and then obviously like I went to military and
[1:11:08.020 --> 1:11:12.020]  it became even more, and so when you get out,
[1:11:12.020 --> 1:11:15.460]  and I wanted to try to find something due to make an impact,
[1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:19.620]  I chose being a special ed teacher, and when I got into it,
[1:11:19.620 --> 1:11:24.340]  these young men lose themselves in these video games, and all the things that
[1:11:24.340 --> 1:11:29.220]  are going on in social media, and it's hard to connect because teachers
[1:11:29.220 --> 1:11:31.780]  struggle with building relationships with kids,
[1:11:31.780 --> 1:11:35.540]  it's even harder when you're in a situation like with a pandemic where
[1:11:35.540 --> 1:11:38.740]  people are not going to school and there's no continuity,
[1:11:38.740 --> 1:11:42.500]  there's no predictability, there's nothing there to be able to
[1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:46.980]  help people manage behavior, and when you're off that long,
[1:11:46.980 --> 1:11:51.140]  those kids get in different cycles and that's what we're seeing
[1:11:51.140 --> 1:11:54.900]  all over the place. They get a downward spiral into darkness, let me ask this
[1:11:54.900 --> 1:11:56.820]  question, you're obviously being respectful and
[1:11:56.820 --> 1:12:00.340]  you know, not specifically talking about him, but this is a big public interest,
[1:12:00.340 --> 1:12:04.820]  you're anonymous here, what did you observe?
[1:12:04.820 --> 1:12:08.500]  I've seen articles by his friends saying last year or so he disappeared during
[1:12:08.500 --> 1:12:12.340]  the lockdown, got really dark, started self-harming himself,
[1:12:12.340 --> 1:12:14.820]  got obsessed with shoot-up-up games, started getting into
[1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:21.220]  dark, occultic stuff, what child or young man did you see
[1:12:21.220 --> 1:12:24.100]  versus the one that reportedly did this atrocity?
[1:12:24.100 --> 1:12:29.220]  So I saw more a social Alex to where in somebody,
[1:12:29.220 --> 1:12:33.300]  a young person that has a social tendency, they're going to be more
[1:12:33.300 --> 1:12:36.340]  kind of by themselves, they might be social but they're going to be social
[1:12:36.340 --> 1:12:41.300]  with like a select group of students, and so he was more just
[1:12:41.300 --> 1:12:45.700]  to me just removed from the situation, but he was still approachable
[1:12:45.700 --> 1:12:48.980]  and so you know especially at the end of the day
[1:12:48.980 --> 1:12:52.500]  I would go out and I had students all over the place and I'm there
[1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:56.100]  like like how I am, there's a lot of proactive educators
[1:12:56.100 --> 1:12:59.220]  and I'll walk around and I just kind of get the temperature of what's going on
[1:12:59.220 --> 1:13:02.180]  around the kids because I want to know what's going on
[1:13:02.180 --> 1:13:05.620]  and I think that's one of the on the side note like one of the things you have to
[1:13:05.620 --> 1:13:09.140]  do in order to combat this, people have to learn how to communicate again
[1:13:09.140 --> 1:13:14.180]  and collaborate because if I had been, you know I'm not saying I would have
[1:13:14.180 --> 1:13:17.460]  made a difference, but like if I'd had been interacting
[1:13:17.460 --> 1:13:20.100]  with him, I've been away from the district for a couple years
[1:13:20.100 --> 1:13:24.580]  and if I'd have been interacting with him or with kids that he had been around
[1:13:24.580 --> 1:13:27.540]  I would have been able to tell that something's off but
[1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:31.620]  everybody's radar should already be up because with all these kids coming
[1:13:31.620 --> 1:13:34.660]  back after being on lockdown for so long
[1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:38.260]  and there's been incidents that have been happening all over the place
[1:13:38.260 --> 1:13:42.100]  across the state, not only involving guns but like if you look at
[1:13:42.100 --> 1:13:45.620]  what happened in New Bromphills High School where kids broke into the school
[1:13:45.620 --> 1:13:48.740]  and destroyed the interior of the school and I think what you're saying is
[1:13:48.740 --> 1:13:52.260]  key because they're now saying he drove around with friends and egged cards and
[1:13:52.260 --> 1:13:56.340]  shot people with BB guns and then you get in a worse and worse
[1:13:56.340 --> 1:13:59.060]  group and it goes from egging and BB guns to
[1:13:59.060 --> 1:14:03.540]  real guns. I never shot people with BB guns but I did on Halloween run around
[1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:07.380]  and you know throw eggs at people and then it escalated to
[1:14:07.380 --> 1:14:10.980]  you know throwing a pumpkin off of a bridge
[1:14:10.980 --> 1:14:13.460]  that hit a pickup truck could have killed people and that's about the worst
[1:14:13.460 --> 1:14:18.580]  stuff I've done but some of those friends I had then got in trouble later
[1:14:18.580 --> 1:14:21.540]  years later after I'd already moved out of where I lived
[1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:25.060]  for things like arson and went to jail so that's that downward spiral you're
[1:14:25.060 --> 1:14:28.580]  talking about. Yes sir.
[1:14:29.300 --> 1:14:32.740]  And we know all the statistics we know the facts this is real world of
[1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:36.500]  years of not being at school years of being cut off from people and
[1:14:36.500 --> 1:14:40.740]  good peer grips sinking off into bad peer grips during all this
[1:14:40.740 --> 1:14:44.420]  I mean they know this caused massive speech impediments in children
[1:14:44.420 --> 1:14:48.180]  massive loss of learning I mean this is just
[1:14:48.180 --> 1:14:50.820]  and the globalists knew exactly what they were doing.
[1:14:50.820 --> 1:14:55.460]  I'm sorry to interrupt but I just want to say that in Uvaldi
[1:14:55.460 --> 1:15:00.100]  because it's so close to the border they've got a jet corridor that connects
[1:15:00.100 --> 1:15:03.060]  Del Rio to San Antonio that they're constantly working
[1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:06.820]  there's federal law enforcement everywhere border patrol you name the agency
[1:15:06.820 --> 1:15:10.260]  they're there and so the fact that he got where he got
[1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:15.460]  in that town and it just there's so much law enforcement that are moving around
[1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:18.900]  at any one time or they're going through there
[1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:24.580]  that's that that community both the Hispanic and the Caucasian community
[1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:28.900]  in that area everybody's armed and so like it's it's one of those
[1:15:28.900 --> 1:15:32.980]  situations where the from what I can see in the reports
[1:15:32.980 --> 1:15:36.980]  the attack unit from the border patrol just happened to be almost like right in
[1:15:36.980 --> 1:15:39.540]  that area and they responded before they even had backup
[1:15:39.540 --> 1:15:43.380]  which is a testament to how great our law enforcement is
[1:15:43.380 --> 1:15:46.580]  and I think the only short way in the quick way to solve this
[1:15:46.580 --> 1:15:49.700]  is to immediately put more police on all in all schools.
[1:15:49.700 --> 1:15:53.140]  Matthew I agree with you stay there I want you to have a minute to finish up

[1:20:13.700 --> 1:20:19.060]  19 dead children at elementary school who had teachers
[1:20:19.060 --> 1:20:35.060]  and a dead psycho could have been saved from a Christ
[1:20:35.060 --> 1:20:40.500]  with the way they were living today
[1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:47.540]  you talk lots about God freedom comes from the call
[1:20:47.540 --> 1:20:51.300]  all right matthew i appreciate all the other callers holding i appreciate you
[1:20:51.300 --> 1:20:54.660]  holding um in any other observations you'd like
[1:20:54.660 --> 1:20:57.620]  to make as a special ed teacher and an army veteran
[1:20:57.620 --> 1:21:02.900]  who did did work with this young man that went
[1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:06.420]  into a very very dark place and is now committed reportedly a
[1:21:06.420 --> 1:21:11.940]  serious heinous crimes of the highest level any other points you'd like to
[1:21:11.940 --> 1:21:15.860]  make when i appreciate you calling in yes sir i would like to first of all say
[1:21:15.860 --> 1:21:19.060]  that as a country we need to recolaborate
[1:21:19.060 --> 1:21:25.700]  our priorities to center around not only the mental health crisis
[1:21:25.700 --> 1:21:31.140]  but we need to refund police in a way where they're treated and by the way
[1:21:31.140 --> 1:21:34.580]  teachers and paraprofessionals all those people that go out and
[1:21:34.580 --> 1:21:41.380]  sacrifice every day for barely anything do it because they care for those kids
[1:21:41.380 --> 1:21:44.660]  and so it's hard to watch because people make a
[1:21:44.660 --> 1:21:49.700]  sacrifice to go out and do that every day and i feel bad for those parents
[1:21:49.700 --> 1:21:53.940]  oh my gosh i've got uh did you have children matthew
[1:21:53.940 --> 1:21:59.140]  yes sir i do well i've got four and i mean tell me about yours because i mean
[1:21:59.140 --> 1:22:03.700]  uh i've got a five-year-old daughter and it just tears my guts out to just
[1:22:03.700 --> 1:22:07.460]  think about how somebody could sit there and just
[1:22:07.460 --> 1:22:11.860]  point blank range shoot little babies well it makes you
[1:22:11.860 --> 1:22:16.180]  it it it heightens your awareness for one thing because
[1:22:16.180 --> 1:22:20.980]  you know as a as an educator um you're constantly wanting to manage your clock
[1:22:20.980 --> 1:22:24.340]  and make sure that everybody around you is doing well
[1:22:24.340 --> 1:22:28.980]  and we've lost on a lot of that and it it makes me afraid for my two children
[1:22:28.980 --> 1:22:34.420]  minor uh within that range of of age that would be
[1:22:34.420 --> 1:22:38.740]  you know in an elementary one with one's in intermediate but one's in
[1:22:38.740 --> 1:22:44.180]  early elementary and it's tough because um we've got a looming
[1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:47.780]  teacher shortage not only within the state but around the country and the
[1:22:47.780 --> 1:22:52.740]  mainstream media does not talk about it but we've got to like i said
[1:22:52.740 --> 1:22:58.100]  recalibrate our focus on making sure that we have the right people in
[1:22:58.100 --> 1:23:02.580]  place to not only give supports but make sure that these
[1:23:02.580 --> 1:23:06.660]  these young people if if we're detecting that something's not working right
[1:23:06.660 --> 1:23:10.980]  we've got to have mechanism in place i don't think i don't agree with the fact
[1:23:10.980 --> 1:23:16.020]  that he could legally purchase uh any kind of weapon at 18
[1:23:16.020 --> 1:23:19.220]  without going through some sort of mental evaluation
[1:23:19.220 --> 1:23:23.140]  you're barely developing especially well expanding on that he's being described
[1:23:23.140 --> 1:23:26.820]  as autistic as i know you can't diagnose somebody not a doctor but
[1:23:26.820 --> 1:23:32.660]  was he on the spectrum in your opinion i i can't i without violating his his
[1:23:32.660 --> 1:23:37.300]  FERPA information um i unfortunately i'm not i don't want to
[1:23:37.300 --> 1:23:41.940]  comment on that alex because it's he's still technically a student he was a
[1:23:41.940 --> 1:23:44.980]  student at the high school he's a senior and so
[1:23:44.980 --> 1:23:48.180]  he's even though he's 18 the law like i'm not
[1:23:48.180 --> 1:23:51.300]  no i totally understand i understand in fact i didn't think about that
[1:23:51.300 --> 1:23:54.820]  you're right there's laws you can't you can't do that well clearly
[1:23:54.820 --> 1:23:58.260]  that's what the evidence is showing here and again
[1:23:58.260 --> 1:24:02.020]  they half the transgenders are autistic because they target them
[1:24:02.020 --> 1:24:05.140]  in the schools the bad schools not good schools like yours
[1:24:05.140 --> 1:24:09.300]  the leftist schools they target them and confuse them and then almost all the
[1:24:09.300 --> 1:24:14.900]  shooters are as well uh matthew i'd like to invite you
[1:24:14.900 --> 1:24:18.260]  on the war room if you can come on or back tomorrow please don't hang up we're
[1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:22.180]  going to put you on hold and talk to you god bless you
[1:24:22.180 --> 1:24:25.060]  all right now i said i take a lot of calls to move quick but did you get a
[1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:27.220]  call like that i think everybody understands why for 30 minutes i've
[1:24:27.220 --> 1:24:31.380]  had that man on um i'm gonna go to some calls now i'm gonna
[1:24:31.380 --> 1:24:33.940]  reach call about two minutes because i don't want to make the rest of you hold
[1:24:33.940 --> 1:24:37.860]  i'm gonna go in the order these calls have been received uh let's talk to
[1:24:37.860 --> 1:24:43.700]  riko in texas riko uh what is your view on the future of america
[1:24:43.700 --> 1:24:46.900]  yes sir i got blue two beautiful ones i've been hearing you
[1:24:46.900 --> 1:24:50.180]  uh it's it's a little muffled but go ahead
[1:24:50.180 --> 1:24:55.700]  okay well um i just want to say that guns are not the problem here
[1:24:55.700 --> 1:25:00.980]  the problem with this situation is the culture of america
[1:25:00.980 --> 1:25:04.500]  the culture of america has taken over the mind of a lot of people
[1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:08.580]  and as time goes by you're only going to see it's getting worse
[1:25:08.580 --> 1:25:12.740]  and worse until the united states finally falls
[1:25:12.740 --> 1:25:16.580]  that's really all i can think about right now i agree that our trajectory is
[1:25:16.580 --> 1:25:20.260]  total collapse and world warrior because we've forgot god you're absolutely
[1:25:20.260 --> 1:25:24.980]  right yep and um yeah like i said man it's
[1:25:24.980 --> 1:25:27.540]  right now it's time to get more guns if you can
[1:25:27.540 --> 1:25:30.980]  because uh in a few years it's probably a few months
[1:25:30.980 --> 1:25:34.100]  gonna get worse and and guns are gonna get hard to find so
[1:25:34.100 --> 1:25:37.460]  right now you're right i mean it's preposterous to blame gun owners
[1:25:37.460 --> 1:25:40.660]  the fact that there are psychos out there is the reason we have guns the
[1:25:40.660 --> 1:25:43.460]  reason i got an arm guard 50 feet from me right there
[1:25:43.460 --> 1:25:47.300]  highly trained uh and and and that that's the reason there's more
[1:25:47.300 --> 1:25:51.620]  and we have to pay for that because we're a target and it is damn real
[1:25:51.620 --> 1:25:56.420]  that's right and one more thing say black big dicks in your
[1:25:56.420 --> 1:26:00.580]  head good good that is a really really good uh
[1:26:00.580 --> 1:26:06.580]  i don't know how people can make jokes about a mass murder
[1:26:06.580 --> 1:26:11.380]  and then do a prank call i mean i mean i mean it's it's
[1:26:11.380 --> 1:26:15.540]  it's not a joke that these 19 children are dead it's not funny
[1:26:15.540 --> 1:26:20.420]  and i wouldn't want to be you when you meet god with attitude like that
[1:26:20.420 --> 1:26:23.140]  and you know so i can make points like that and then
[1:26:23.140 --> 1:26:26.420]  to just we delayed it out radio stations didn't hear it
[1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:30.500]  tv stations didn't didn't hear it uh but
[1:26:30.500 --> 1:26:33.780]  it's just it's just sick and i forgive you and i love you
[1:26:33.780 --> 1:26:37.620]  and i appreciate you that last call there's a lot of lost people like him
[1:26:37.620 --> 1:26:40.660]  he's probably very similar to this guy that just did this
[1:26:40.660 --> 1:26:45.140]  and i forgive you and i care about you
[1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:48.980]  let's go ahead and take another caller here let's talk to danielle in texas
[1:26:48.980 --> 1:26:54.980]  danielle thanks for holding hi alex um i don't know if you know but yesterday
[1:26:54.980 --> 1:27:00.020]  at the same time of that school shooting the little county that i live in in
[1:27:00.020 --> 1:27:05.300]  east texas reins county apprehended a student at our school with two hand guns
[1:27:05.300 --> 1:27:09.780]  and a shotgun well i mean look if you advertise
[1:27:09.780 --> 1:27:13.460]  something everywhere mentally ill people are going to do it so they just obsess
[1:27:13.460 --> 1:27:17.380]  on school shootings they hype them up and we know they come in clusters because
[1:27:17.380 --> 1:27:19.700]  copycats are coming and that's a great point
[1:27:19.700 --> 1:27:23.220]  i would expect in the next week or two we'll have another big mass shooting and
[1:27:23.220 --> 1:27:26.900]  i mean it's it's obvious what's going on here
[1:27:26.900 --> 1:27:31.060]  yes it's also a little disturbing that they're happening at the same time it
[1:27:31.060 --> 1:27:35.540]  makes it a little bit suspicious well i mean look somebody probably groomed
[1:27:35.540 --> 1:27:39.380]  this guy somebody probably programmed him uh but we can't prove that we know
[1:27:39.380 --> 1:27:43.300]  theodore kasinski was groomed by the cia and control of the cia that that's
[1:27:43.300 --> 1:27:47.460]  mainstream news just back at the paper uh so yeah it goes on it could be going
[1:27:47.460 --> 1:27:50.340]  on but again they don't need to do individual mind control now
[1:27:50.340 --> 1:27:55.620]  the culture is mind control absolutely absolutely
[1:27:55.620 --> 1:27:58.980]  thank you and that's what's upsetting about that last caller danielle
[1:27:58.980 --> 1:28:01.940]  is he called in and made that point if it's an evil culture it's going to get
[1:28:01.940 --> 1:28:05.860]  worse and then he makes a sick comment you know it's just sick
[1:28:05.860 --> 1:28:10.580]  yes we have to pray for our society what else is on your mind danielle
[1:28:10.580 --> 1:28:15.380]  i'm just a happy homeschool mom today boy i gotta tell you
[1:28:15.380 --> 1:28:18.500]  that's what my wife said because you know we're thinking about
[1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:20.900]  a five-year-old daughter at private school or something and we're just like
[1:28:20.900 --> 1:28:25.220]  let's just let's just keep her home yeah i mean you know that
[1:28:25.220 --> 1:28:28.660]  it's time to stop letting other people teach our children
[1:28:28.660 --> 1:28:31.620]  absolutely the real thing is how to roof a roof how to plant a garden how to
[1:28:31.620 --> 1:28:36.100]  cook food how to tire shoelaces how to be a good person
[1:28:36.100 --> 1:28:40.340]  everything else doesn't matter the whole educational system is programmed
[1:28:40.340 --> 1:28:43.860]  for a system that's over that's gone and and and so that's why they're
[1:28:43.860 --> 1:28:46.740]  engineering a post industrial world we love you danielle thank you
[1:28:46.740 --> 1:28:50.420]  i'm gonna come right back and i'm gonna take all these calls

[1:31:58.260 --> 1:32:02.340]  the globalist social engineers always intended to push
[1:32:02.340 --> 1:32:08.900]  their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled
[1:32:08.900 --> 1:32:12.740]  they would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law
[1:32:12.740 --> 1:32:16.420]  and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out
[1:32:16.420 --> 1:32:20.340]  against their lives but because of so many scientists and engineers and
[1:32:20.340 --> 1:32:24.500]  researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers
[1:32:24.500 --> 1:32:28.740]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[1:32:28.740 --> 1:32:32.820]  that it is a world government corporate takeover
[1:32:32.820 --> 1:32:36.180]  and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever
[1:32:36.180 --> 1:32:39.540]  the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up
[1:32:39.540 --> 1:32:43.060]  on their takeover like canada but they've now declared
[1:32:43.060 --> 1:32:46.500]  a civil emergency in martial law in ontario
[1:32:46.500 --> 1:32:49.620]  and other areas of the world are following suit like australia
[1:32:49.620 --> 1:32:53.380]  so pray for these folks big time this is a very serious situation
[1:32:53.380 --> 1:32:58.900]  and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely bare mountain

[1:33:18.420 --> 1:33:21.940]  what an incredible realization that we're in the tip of the spear
[1:33:21.940 --> 1:33:25.220]  the ragtag group that is infowars this whole family of listeners
[1:33:25.220 --> 1:33:29.540]  i love you all and i mean that these globalists have such hate for us they
[1:33:29.540 --> 1:33:33.380]  want to be populated they want to bankrupt us they want to enslave us
[1:33:33.380 --> 1:33:37.140]  they want us hopeless but we have god and we have hope
[1:33:37.140 --> 1:33:40.980]  and like all other tyrants in history we will overcome them
[1:33:40.980 --> 1:33:44.740]  now i'm gonna go right back to your calls but i wanted to say this
[1:33:44.740 --> 1:33:50.420]  because later once we go to these calls i'm gonna cover this let's just remember
[1:33:50.420 --> 1:33:54.820]  that the un said two years ago the lockdowns
[1:33:54.820 --> 1:34:01.620]  we're gonna put 278 million people the estimated on the verge of starvation
[1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:06.500]  and an extra 20 million a year would die and they nailed it and that's accurate
[1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:12.180]  40 million people died i wake up at night and think about that
[1:34:12.180 --> 1:34:15.220]  because let me tell you something i'm god fearing and i've got a spirit and it's
[1:34:15.220 --> 1:34:22.820]  connected to things and
[1:34:22.820 --> 1:34:27.140]  you know i'm not going to tell the story it's just too intense and i said i go
[1:34:27.140 --> 1:34:32.820]  to your calls but i had a vision when i was three years old
[1:34:32.820 --> 1:34:36.340]  it's one of my earliest most intense memories
[1:34:36.340 --> 1:34:43.220]  and it was starving african children
[1:34:43.220 --> 1:34:47.940]  that were just crying out for food and my parents heard me crying in my room in
[1:34:47.940 --> 1:34:51.940]  the middle of the night and they came in and my parents remember this and it was
[1:34:51.940 --> 1:34:55.220]  very intense it was a recurring dream after that
[1:34:55.220 --> 1:35:00.580]  and it was real what i was seeing and i didn't understand it all obviously when
[1:35:00.580 --> 1:35:06.020]  i was three years old but it was a mission to not let what was
[1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:10.980]  coming even bigger happen and i remember spiritually
[1:35:10.980 --> 1:35:15.620]  feeling the holy spirit incredibly intense
[1:35:15.620 --> 1:35:19.220]  and like giving me an imprint of information that you're gonna you're
[1:35:19.220 --> 1:35:22.900]  gonna help mitigate this you're gonna help stop this this is your mission
[1:35:22.900 --> 1:35:26.180]  and i remember being given this total sorrow
[1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:30.020]  and the desperation of those children and it was
[1:35:30.020 --> 1:35:33.700]  it was the most intense thing that's ever happened to me in my life
[1:35:33.700 --> 1:35:37.060]  bar none nothing's ever been one tenth as intense
[1:35:37.060 --> 1:35:40.660]  and it was it's a lot more complex than that and i tried to never talked about it
[1:35:40.660 --> 1:35:45.460]  to even friends or family and i guess a few times my parents
[1:35:45.460 --> 1:35:49.940]  i've talked about when i would cry i was like three years old
[1:35:49.940 --> 1:35:52.980]  and i hadn't seen tv shows about starving children i was just it was like
[1:35:52.980 --> 1:35:56.660]  super intense i was there with the children dying
[1:35:56.660 --> 1:36:00.740]  who were begging begging for food and their parents didn't have it
[1:36:00.740 --> 1:36:04.980]  and then years later i was watching a pbs documentary i think was pbs
[1:36:04.980 --> 1:36:08.980]  and it showed this father working all day tirelessly and he was super skinny and
[1:36:08.980 --> 1:36:12.900]  starving to death and his wife couldn't even produce enough milk
[1:36:12.900 --> 1:36:16.260]  and a couple of their kids had already died and
[1:36:16.260 --> 1:36:19.700]  he was there saying all i've got is these fruits i'm sorry to like the two
[1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:23.540]  year old and it was crying saying daddy daddy daddy daddy please help me
[1:36:23.540 --> 1:36:28.020]  and it's it's it's it's it's i mean we can't just go
[1:36:28.020 --> 1:36:31.300]  oh there's this third world population they're useless and let them die
[1:36:31.300 --> 1:36:34.740]  if we do that we're supposed to save those people but really save them not
[1:36:34.740 --> 1:36:38.100]  weaponize them and bring them here and have them burn everything down if we
[1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:41.700]  don't lift those people up not just in africa but everybody but the vision was
[1:36:41.700 --> 1:36:46.180]  africa if we don't do that god's going to
[1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:50.980]  damn us to hell i can tell you now that that is a fact
[1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:54.660]  and if we don't try to save people like salvador ramos
[1:36:54.660 --> 1:37:00.500]  we don't have any hope and the left poses as the people trying to save people
[1:37:00.500 --> 1:37:03.860]  when they're the actual ones manufacturing and producing this i'm
[1:37:03.860 --> 1:37:08.420]  going to shut up now it's true story and it's it's amazing unity in texas
[1:37:08.420 --> 1:37:12.260]  welcome you're on the air hey alex how you doing
[1:37:12.260 --> 1:37:14.820]  i'm all right it's the eagles making a smooth brother
[1:37:14.820 --> 1:37:18.420]  so i mean it is it is i just want to say
[1:37:18.420 --> 1:37:21.940]  god bless everyone in u valentine god bless all of us
[1:37:21.940 --> 1:37:26.340]  go into these times um another thing is i you know
[1:37:26.340 --> 1:37:30.180]  should these teachers should be drug tested um
[1:37:30.180 --> 1:37:34.420]  all teachers should the school board should they be drug tested
[1:37:34.420 --> 1:37:38.420]  uh number one number two are the live by live abilities
[1:37:38.420 --> 1:37:41.540]  in the doctor's laps are they in the school board's laps
[1:37:41.540 --> 1:37:45.540]  are they in the video game manufacturer's laps should we have
[1:37:45.540 --> 1:37:49.300]  a mental health questionnaire for video games should we lock these
[1:37:49.300 --> 1:37:52.820]  uh the games up like we do the guns and have them transferred
[1:37:52.820 --> 1:37:57.380]  like guns have an ffl and have a bgl video game
[1:37:57.380 --> 1:38:00.580]  licensor we're gonna have to do something
[1:38:00.580 --> 1:38:04.900]  to protect these children in these schools is strip malls
[1:38:04.900 --> 1:38:09.620]  have armed guards walking around looking at their phones
[1:38:09.620 --> 1:38:13.700]  just nothing's going on that's right we got armed guards guard guarding
[1:38:13.700 --> 1:38:20.580]  garbage uh restaurants and garbage uh jewelry shops the
[1:38:20.580 --> 1:38:24.340]  jewelry is not worth anything our children are everything
[1:38:24.340 --> 1:38:27.940]  well it's areas of commerce that we're protecting enough areas
[1:38:27.940 --> 1:38:34.660]  of of of value which is our children any species that doesn't protect its young
[1:38:34.660 --> 1:38:38.500]  will become extinct should we not have mag strips
[1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:42.900]  in the uh in the in the school school rooms bullet proof uh
[1:38:42.900 --> 1:38:47.540]  blasts on the the doors we have them in banks
[1:38:47.540 --> 1:38:51.940]  it's it's something's got to be done we're you know that's a great point
[1:38:51.940 --> 1:38:56.340]  because i don't like the police state but it's not a police state when psychos
[1:38:56.340 --> 1:39:00.500]  are spiritually targeting our young to harden those facilities
[1:39:00.500 --> 1:39:05.300]  i i go back to the manufacturer the drugs okay
[1:39:05.300 --> 1:39:08.500]  these kids shouldn't be on all this dope
[1:39:08.500 --> 1:39:11.940]  they shouldn't be these kids need to be they need to be
[1:39:11.940 --> 1:39:16.180]  eating clean healthy diets we need to be supporting and cultivating that in our
[1:39:16.180 --> 1:39:19.300]  school districts i agree they ought to have a period
[1:39:19.300 --> 1:39:24.180]  every day and so they can have eight hours of it happening
[1:39:24.180 --> 1:39:28.260]  they should be growing giant gardens and there should be horticulture going on
[1:39:28.260 --> 1:39:32.980]  and agriculture going on at every single school in this country
[1:39:32.980 --> 1:39:35.780]  this stuff has been massaged out of our schools
[1:39:35.780 --> 1:39:39.300]  and other things that are nefarious have been
[1:39:39.300 --> 1:39:43.460]  allowed to come into our schools uh though that caller that was talking
[1:39:43.460 --> 1:39:46.980]  so greatly about watching out and all these hard times and then once the pop
[1:39:46.980 --> 1:39:51.060]  off that dumbass the ridiculous remark at the end
[1:39:51.060 --> 1:39:54.660]  that's the mental illness right there is a great example of what we're dealing
[1:39:54.660 --> 1:39:59.060]  with i'm you know again it's it's the it's the
[1:39:59.060 --> 1:40:02.660]  pharmaceuticals it's the drugs flooding into this country we have a southern
[1:40:02.660 --> 1:40:05.620]  border right it is it is the drugs both illegal and
[1:40:05.620 --> 1:40:08.900]  legal that are wrecking everything and i'm not perfect
[1:40:08.900 --> 1:40:14.340]  you know i don't use like any type of speed or cocaine uh but you know i have
[1:40:14.340 --> 1:40:17.780]  smoked marijuana some here and there and for somebody like me
[1:40:17.780 --> 1:40:20.260]  smoking it once a month when you're really tired or whatever
[1:40:20.260 --> 1:40:24.420]  and you know still racing it's one thing but it's not your grandma's pot
[1:40:24.420 --> 1:40:27.940]  and just even having it destroys our culture didn't you make it illegal
[1:40:27.940 --> 1:40:31.620]  that makes a giant prison complex it needs to be decriminalized
[1:40:31.620 --> 1:40:34.660]  but it needs to be policed and it needs to be limited and people need to be
[1:40:34.660 --> 1:40:38.180]  educated to stay the hell away from it because it is the drugs that are
[1:40:38.180 --> 1:40:41.780]  destroying us yeah hip also is a joke it's nothing
[1:40:41.780 --> 1:40:45.700]  more than and to keep everybody segmented and compartmentalized
[1:40:45.700 --> 1:40:49.460]  and i know there's some advantages of it but think about it
[1:40:49.460 --> 1:40:52.900]  when you ask anyone what's your health problems they gladly tell you everything
[1:40:52.900 --> 1:40:55.940]  under the sun that's wrong with them it's not a secret
[1:40:55.940 --> 1:41:00.340]  it's it's that's a tool it's it's a weaponized tool i well said sir thank
[1:41:00.340 --> 1:41:03.860]  you so much for the call unity powerful caller
[1:41:03.860 --> 1:41:06.660]  i only we got two minutes to break but i'm gonna go ahead and go to tommy in
[1:41:06.660 --> 1:41:10.260]  texas go ahead tommy hey alex thanks for having me on
[1:41:10.260 --> 1:41:13.860]  yes sir hey um i just wanted to make a point um
[1:41:13.860 --> 1:41:18.820]  yesterday with the aftermath of the shooting um social media was going crazy
[1:41:18.820 --> 1:41:21.860]  and of course you got these liberal representatives attacking all these
[1:41:21.860 --> 1:41:25.780]  republican congressmen and representative senators and all that
[1:41:25.780 --> 1:41:30.100]  um my question to you is at what point do they have enough of being vilified for
[1:41:30.100 --> 1:41:34.100]  this situation and do they take it in their hands and go
[1:41:34.100 --> 1:41:38.980]  back on these liberals that are attacking them for being a baby killer
[1:41:38.980 --> 1:41:43.460]  well exactly they have no debate they want open-air drug markets they want to
[1:41:43.460 --> 1:41:46.900]  abort babies after they're born they want drag queen story time they tell us
[1:41:46.900 --> 1:41:49.540]  there's so many people oh but then there's a mass shooting
[1:41:49.540 --> 1:41:53.700]  all the pro-life people all the gun owners were to blame it's it's ridiculous
[1:41:53.700 --> 1:41:58.580]  it is and this may sound kind of demented and i couldn't help but think of it
[1:41:58.580 --> 1:42:02.100]  if that shooter would have went into a nursery and shot babies the left might
[1:42:02.100 --> 1:42:06.340]  have praised him saying he actually had he'd have gone and shot like
[1:42:06.340 --> 1:42:10.260]  20-something pregnant women and they were like damn that's good you know
[1:42:10.260 --> 1:42:13.380]  yeah they would have praised him as a hero saying he was pro-choice and i know
[1:42:13.380 --> 1:42:17.140]  that's sickening but if we are at that point where that exactly we don't we
[1:42:17.140 --> 1:42:20.980]  don't value the weakest and then when they're five years old we value them
[1:42:20.980 --> 1:42:25.380]  that's sick and and i don't understand how any
[1:42:25.380 --> 1:42:29.220]  of these liberals can stand up and say they're pro-choice and be upset over
[1:42:29.220 --> 1:42:33.860]  supreme court ruling of roby wade and that you know be oh well we got to
[1:42:33.860 --> 1:42:36.580]  protect children when they want to abort them as it is
[1:42:36.580 --> 1:42:40.340]  so this guy killed them six years later and now they're acting like it's all
[1:42:40.340 --> 1:42:43.380]  these republicans fault i'm more disgusted
[1:42:43.380 --> 1:42:46.980]  act the lack of response from the republicans not taking the gloves off
[1:42:46.980 --> 1:42:50.900]  and coming back after these bastards i agree that's the big issue i meant to
[1:42:50.900 --> 1:42:53.380]  make today thank you so much tony great points
[1:42:53.380 --> 1:42:57.460]  is the where the republicans punching back

[1:43:58.580 --> 1:44:02.740]  the eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans
[1:44:02.740 --> 1:44:08.100]  they financed major universities they ran full page stories and advertisements
[1:44:08.100 --> 1:44:11.620]  pushing their propaganda of new york times other major newspapers
[1:44:11.620 --> 1:44:14.660]  that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[1:44:14.660 --> 1:44:18.500]  it must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the
[1:44:18.500 --> 1:44:22.020]  household teaching women that cooking dinner and
[1:44:22.020 --> 1:44:25.540]  taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing
[1:44:25.540 --> 1:44:29.140]  and i was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my
[1:44:29.140 --> 1:44:32.100]  four-in-a-half-year-old daughter my wife makes dinner a lot of times but i like
[1:44:32.100 --> 1:44:34.100]  to make it as well i love to make breakfast
[1:44:34.100 --> 1:44:38.020]  and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family
[1:44:38.020 --> 1:44:43.060]  and be nurtured and then all sit down together and have that communal event
[1:44:43.060 --> 1:44:46.500]  and that's what the system is attacking and bombarding
[1:44:46.500 --> 1:44:50.500]  is our normal biological actions and coming together they really are
[1:44:50.500 --> 1:44:53.540]  sick evil scientific cult of filth that want to
[1:44:53.540 --> 1:44:58.180]  domesticate us and turn us into lab rats we cannot let this continue
[1:44:58.180 --> 1:45:00.660]  with the world awakening i think what's important that we were right though
[1:45:00.660 --> 1:45:03.700]  to prevent them right now take advantage of this moment and i have all of an
[1:45:03.700 --> 1:45:06.900]  idea of this something everybody can do with every listener can do i think it
[1:45:06.900 --> 1:45:10.260]  would be powerful and effective for us to uh you know hang the banners over
[1:45:10.260 --> 1:45:12.500]  highways imagine a champagne or a pizza or a
[1:45:12.500 --> 1:45:15.700]  landing or a plane uh that says Alex Jones is right info war stop

[1:50:39.860 --> 1:50:43.460]  it's been reported by mainstream news the drug addicted mother was being evicted
[1:50:43.460 --> 1:50:47.140]  by the grandmother because i guess she and her son
[1:50:47.140 --> 1:50:53.300]  were were being abusive uh and the grandfather's like a convicted felon
[1:50:53.300 --> 1:50:57.540]  and the dad is nowhere to be seen so another broken family and another
[1:50:57.540 --> 1:51:04.740]  evil event well no wonder this kid has had so many problems i mean
[1:51:04.740 --> 1:51:10.900]  if he had mental problems or artistic or anything like that and he doesn't have
[1:51:10.900 --> 1:51:14.820]  a nuclear family a normal nuclear bomb a dead family
[1:51:14.820 --> 1:51:19.540]  that just with the lockdown that just i can see how this all happened but it's
[1:51:19.540 --> 1:51:22.260]  i'm seeing this everywhere where there's just no dad
[1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:27.300]  and these families all over the place now and and there's nobody to discipline
[1:51:27.300 --> 1:51:29.300]  them there's nobody to teach them how to be a man
[1:51:29.300 --> 1:51:32.980]  like adam lands uh it's always the same mo into devil worship into wearing
[1:51:32.980 --> 1:51:36.500]  black into shoot them up video games into self-harming
[1:51:36.500 --> 1:51:40.100]  single parent yep that's what and we're not and the left goes don't attack single
[1:51:40.100 --> 1:51:44.420]  parents we're not we know the statistics we know the numbers we
[1:51:44.420 --> 1:51:48.020]  know what's happening well with the lockdowns that are
[1:51:48.020 --> 1:51:51.460]  about to happen because that's that's what's going to go on with the next
[1:51:51.460 --> 1:51:53.860]  election i mean like you said it's only a
[1:51:53.860 --> 1:51:58.340]  hundred and seven days away and they're going to do everything they can
[1:51:58.340 --> 1:52:01.380]  with this monkey pox and whatever else they're gonna
[1:52:01.380 --> 1:52:04.900]  whatever else bill gates is gonna send our way
[1:52:04.900 --> 1:52:10.420]  um this is just going to uh we're looking at not just the lockdown
[1:52:10.420 --> 1:52:14.820]  that was the oil shortage the fertilizer shortage and the things the food
[1:52:14.820 --> 1:52:18.420]  the food shortages that are going to hit us by next year the year
[1:52:18.420 --> 1:52:22.660]  after that is going to be it's going to be devastating
[1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:26.580]  to everybody not just single parents but everybody you're right this is the
[1:52:26.580 --> 1:52:30.740]  globalist in their own words destabilizing society to create anger
[1:52:30.740 --> 1:52:33.220]  and fear to collapse it and bring on their new global
[1:52:33.220 --> 1:52:37.540]  social credit score digital id to buy and sell
[1:52:37.540 --> 1:52:41.380]  great points patty thank you so much for the call all right let's go to a caller
[1:52:41.380 --> 1:52:47.060]  another caller in texas let's talk to andrew andrew thanks for calling
[1:52:48.500 --> 1:52:53.220]  yes sir can you hear me i can't welcome yeah i had a couple points to make i
[1:52:53.220 --> 1:52:56.100]  just wanted to say uh prayers to the families of ubaldi
[1:52:56.100 --> 1:53:00.260]  of the victims and uh it's really tragic what happened i think
[1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:04.740]  the denigration of cultural or the promotion of cultural rot is in
[1:53:04.740 --> 1:53:10.260]  large part due to the expansion of the federal government
[1:53:10.260 --> 1:53:13.220]  and that's sort of what causes these things the more the government expands
[1:53:13.220 --> 1:53:17.060]  the more crazy demonic people it creates becomes a new religion
[1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:20.420]  well that's it the state is the religion and
[1:53:20.420 --> 1:53:24.020]  their religion is satanism and we see the wages of center death it's
[1:53:24.020 --> 1:53:27.380]  very simple you're absolutely right
[1:53:28.020 --> 1:53:30.980]  well thank you taking my call that's all i wanted to say oh brother what you said
[1:53:30.980 --> 1:53:36.100]  is totally true sorry go ahead oh i know you talked about arming the teachers
[1:53:36.100 --> 1:53:39.140]  and i'm real hesitant to do that nowadays especially seeing the lids of
[1:53:39.140 --> 1:53:42.900]  tiktok account i'm hesitant to arm the teachers and uh no that's a good point
[1:53:42.900 --> 1:53:47.540]  there should be a screening process and then they should be trained uh and then
[1:53:47.540 --> 1:53:50.260]  and then so quote they're not being discriminated against
[1:53:50.260 --> 1:53:54.980]  you know it could be like a rotating security detail where the principal
[1:53:54.980 --> 1:53:58.020]  uh you know decides who out of the teachers is going to be armed but i i
[1:53:58.020 --> 1:54:02.260]  think if you put in a large school 20 30 people that are armed it's totally
[1:54:02.260 --> 1:54:05.380]  protected and i think you know smaller schools three or
[1:54:05.380 --> 1:54:08.660]  four people i mean it just needs to be done and you know you might wait
[1:54:08.660 --> 1:54:11.380]  libs up when you give them the responsibility to learn about the
[1:54:11.380 --> 1:54:16.180]  second amendment about being a guardian and not just a victim
[1:54:16.180 --> 1:54:19.940]  i agree with you also thank you for publicans want to go on the proactive
[1:54:19.940 --> 1:54:25.300]  given that we've seen some of the cops and some of these shooting situations
[1:54:25.300 --> 1:54:29.380]  say that again your phone broke up andrew did say that again i was saying
[1:54:29.380 --> 1:54:33.300]  we've seen if the gop wanted to be proactive about the situation
[1:54:33.300 --> 1:54:37.060]  we've seen cops uh and some of these situations sit on their hands how about
[1:54:37.060 --> 1:54:40.180]  incentivizing uh private security companies given them
[1:54:40.180 --> 1:54:44.900]  tax breaks if they're providing security for schools well i'll tell you this in
[1:54:44.900 --> 1:54:49.220]  leftist cities the police are horrible lazy thugs and in more conservative
[1:54:49.220 --> 1:54:52.660]  areas they're super hardworking great people i mean the police just have one
[1:54:52.660 --> 1:54:55.380]  of the roughest jobs nothing but respect for them
[1:54:55.380 --> 1:54:58.740]  when they follow global disorders to violate rights they become bad guys but
[1:54:58.740 --> 1:55:01.940]  the globalists are targeting them to bully them and take them over they're
[1:55:01.940 --> 1:55:05.700]  going to get rid of them they're just taking control of them and i uh
[1:55:05.700 --> 1:55:10.100]  but i do like private security forces because just statistically
[1:55:10.100 --> 1:55:13.460]  they're even better because they can they can kick people out that don't have
[1:55:13.460 --> 1:55:16.740]  what it takes uh and so yeah i mean i'm i'm i'm for a free
[1:55:16.740 --> 1:55:20.420]  market solution private security forces police a mix of the two
[1:55:20.420 --> 1:55:24.100]  and an armed citizens and then uh and then also obviously you're wearing black
[1:55:24.100 --> 1:55:26.980]  you're in a devil worship you're in to shoot them up games you're starting
[1:55:26.980 --> 1:55:30.100]  fights with everybody you need to be closely looked at thank you so much for
[1:55:30.100 --> 1:55:33.540]  your call brother let's jam in one more before we come
[1:55:33.540 --> 1:55:36.900]  back with another excerpt of that famous pears Morgan interview and we'll come
[1:55:36.900 --> 1:55:42.820]  back with the big news out of Venezuela uh right now let's go ahead and talk to
[1:55:43.860 --> 1:55:48.180]  Mike in Fort Worth Texas Mike welcome Alex do you hear me
[1:55:48.180 --> 1:55:51.380]  i can uh hey god bless you brother for
[1:55:51.380 --> 1:55:55.380]  for being the greatest truth teller uh of our time
[1:55:55.380 --> 1:55:58.580]  and you know i i need to get your opinion on this Alex i was talking to a
[1:55:58.580 --> 1:56:02.020]  friend of mine this morning and we were like okay yeah
[1:56:02.020 --> 1:56:05.220]  you know the kid worked at Wendy's i'm sure if he saved enough money it'd be a
[1:56:05.220 --> 1:56:08.340]  pretty penny to buy those guns and all that ammo
[1:56:08.340 --> 1:56:11.860]  i don't know i'm not burst on this you probably well more than me but
[1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:15.300]  how does that kid get all that body armor because it sounds like he was in a
[1:56:15.300 --> 1:56:19.380]  heck of a shootout with the cops and they couldn't take him down before he got in
[1:56:19.380 --> 1:56:23.140]  before the special agent got in i would think that body armor
[1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:27.140]  would cost a ton of money and i don't know how an 18 year old would access all
[1:56:27.140 --> 1:56:30.900]  that and maybe you can expand on how is he pitting down and defeating
[1:56:30.900 --> 1:56:34.820]  multiple arm security people and uh well trained border patrol
[1:56:34.820 --> 1:56:38.020]  i mean it it's the whole thing's very suspicious
[1:56:38.020 --> 1:56:41.380]  absolutely alex and one other thing i'd like to say to that punk
[1:56:41.380 --> 1:56:45.620]  uh Steve Kerr who down here in Dallas the other uh last night
[1:56:45.620 --> 1:56:48.900]  lecturing you and me and senators and all that

[1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:57.220]  that uh a couple years ago was arguing against
[1:56:57.220 --> 1:57:01.780]  uh putting police uh police protection he called him white supremacist and said
[1:57:01.780 --> 1:57:06.500]  pull all police from schools yeah he's a punk alex he's a communist

[2:00:50.580 --> 2:00:54.420]  try and answer some of the questions right here's my issue for you
[2:00:54.420 --> 2:00:58.340]  why do people need civilians need an ar-15 type
[2:00:58.340 --> 2:01:02.340]  assault rifle why they already said statistically they're using a very low
[2:01:02.340 --> 2:01:05.140]  amount of the crimes that's an fb effect they've been using the last three mass
[2:01:05.140 --> 2:01:09.140]  shooting yes why i'll tell you why because they advertise it in the media
[2:01:09.140 --> 2:01:12.260]  anybody knows that if somebody jumps off the impar states building they put cops
[2:01:12.260 --> 2:01:14.980]  up there the next day because copycats come to do it again
[2:01:14.980 --> 2:01:18.580]  the media hypes and hypes and hypes coaches commit suicide
[2:01:18.580 --> 2:01:22.420]  why do people commit suicide by killing a bunch of kids and here's the gun to use
[2:01:22.420 --> 2:01:26.020]  because it's the one the u.s army uses why do people need them
[2:01:26.020 --> 2:01:29.060]  they need them to protect us from the number one killer in history
[2:01:29.060 --> 2:01:34.100]  government the 20th century university uh study out of hawaii killed 292 million

[2:01:42.580 --> 2:01:45.700]  statistically where there's more guns there's lower crime the highest crime
[2:01:45.700 --> 2:01:49.460]  is in bloomberg uh you know but you have the most controlled areas of any of the
[2:01:49.460 --> 2:01:54.260]  23 richest countries in the world and you have twin the 12 america was born on

[2:02:06.740 --> 2:02:10.260]  many many times more alex let's talk about the gun it's not the rock
[2:02:10.260 --> 2:02:14.900]  it's not the knife when a mother chops her kids up with a cleaver because she's
[2:02:14.900 --> 2:02:18.820]  on set on a real me why i'm wrong why don't you want to get rid of the drugs

[2:06:35.700 --> 2:06:40.980]  the 19 dead children two dead teachers there's so many examples of this it's
[2:06:40.980 --> 2:06:43.700]  like communism not working for the general public
[2:06:43.700 --> 2:06:47.220]  but working for the elite communism doesn't work for the people
[2:06:47.220 --> 2:06:50.980]  i don't need to put on exhibits of that but they're trying to launch it again
[2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:56.740]  these are articles out of the bbc out of all mainstream sources

[2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:24.580]  fe.org
[2:07:24.900 --> 2:07:28.420]  and then you have massive government gulags
[2:07:28.420 --> 2:07:31.700]  torture death tanks running over the citizens
[2:07:31.700 --> 2:07:36.260]  after they take the guns total evaluation of the currency
[2:07:36.260 --> 2:07:39.940]  war against the people that's the globalist authoritarian model
[2:07:39.940 --> 2:07:44.740]  how venezuela's good citizens were disarmed is a lesson for us
[2:07:44.740 --> 2:07:49.060]  absolutely is and now let's move to this and i meant to have a photo of him i
[2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:51.540]  forgot to tell you actually pull up the article if we can

[2:08:22.420 --> 2:08:25.300]  while aiming at jeep driving through the crowd
[2:08:25.300 --> 2:08:29.620]  on i-225 the man who shot two people
[2:08:29.620 --> 2:08:33.380]  while aiming at a jeep that drove into a crowd of protesters which is driving
[2:08:33.380 --> 2:08:36.420]  through them on their state 225 in the summer 2020
[2:08:36.420 --> 2:08:39.940]  was sentenced tuesday to 120 days in jail followed by
[2:08:39.940 --> 2:08:42.980]  five months probation but it's all time served
[2:08:42.980 --> 2:08:47.060]  samuel young 24 can we pull this picture up
[2:08:47.060 --> 2:08:50.820]  just type in this article no prison time for man
[2:08:50.820 --> 2:08:57.940]  who shot aurora protesters samuel young 24 earlier this year
[2:08:57.940 --> 2:09:02.580]  was convicted of seven felonies two counts of second degree assault
[2:09:02.580 --> 2:09:06.260]  four counts of attempted manslaughter and a single count of illegally
[2:09:06.260 --> 2:09:10.660]  discharging his gun after he fired five shots during a protest against
[2:09:10.660 --> 2:09:14.020]  police violence in aurora in july 25th
[2:09:14.020 --> 2:09:19.940]  2030 there he is so when a police officer accidentally shoots somebody or
[2:09:19.940 --> 2:09:22.580]  is being physically attacked and pulls their gun and shoots them
[2:09:22.580 --> 2:09:27.300]  they go to prison but when this guy
[2:09:27.300 --> 2:09:31.220]  does all this and tries to kill somebody in a car and shoots other people
[2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:37.540]  his own cohorts he's given no prison time and i've got an article we'll go to
[2:09:37.540 --> 2:09:40.340]  your calls we'll get to it at the end of the show today
[2:09:40.340 --> 2:09:44.340]  where a soros da is prosecuting somebody

[2:09:48.100 --> 2:09:54.660]  so the communists will put you in jail for your speech
[2:09:54.660 --> 2:09:58.500]  or for self-defense but when you shoot innocent people it's
[2:09:58.500 --> 2:10:03.940]  a okay mostly peaceful protest we already had callers bring up the
[2:10:03.940 --> 2:10:07.220]  warriors curb backs ever to remove police from
[2:10:07.220 --> 2:10:10.180]  oakland schools saying they're white supremacists
[2:10:10.180 --> 2:10:14.980]  imagine being the police is having some person like this say you're hitler
[2:10:14.980 --> 2:10:18.100]  anybody that attacks you or shoots you or kills you
[2:10:18.100 --> 2:10:25.300]  is captain america and then he comes out and calls for gun confiscation
[2:10:25.300 --> 2:10:28.740]  last night before the bodies of the poor dead children
[2:10:28.740 --> 2:10:32.820]  and teachers weren't even cold that my friends
[2:10:32.820 --> 2:10:37.860]  is cold that is sick but he's not as bad as the

[2:10:43.700 --> 2:10:46.420]  what do i care about the wiggers they don't even rise
[2:10:46.420 --> 2:10:52.180]  to the level of my consciousness that is truly sick these are dangerous
[2:10:52.180 --> 2:10:55.540]  dangerous people we let them run society we will be destroyed

[2:11:21.700 --> 2:11:25.140]  the car and they're right there with their guns drawn you know
[2:11:25.140 --> 2:11:30.820]  but somehow this kid you know it gets uh walk around just get out of the car
[2:11:30.820 --> 2:11:33.780]  occasionally and walk around the school and this
[2:11:33.780 --> 2:11:38.580]  of that where are these officers you know
[2:11:38.580 --> 2:11:42.260]  well we don't have enough of the facts yet but the mayor of ubaldi has come out
[2:11:42.260 --> 2:11:45.060]  against biden and his demonization of gun owners
[2:11:45.060 --> 2:11:48.820]  and you know you're in a shootout you're in a chase somebody jumps out of a car

[2:12:15.460 --> 2:12:18.100]  we're the as bad as we are we're better than the countries
[2:12:18.100 --> 2:12:21.860]  and that's why we're being targeted and they're using psychological warfare in

[2:13:04.660 --> 2:13:07.460]  three or four neighbors to come over and eat crawfish with them because they

[2:13:36.420 --> 2:13:41.300]  porn and spurt and you know you wonder why radio
[2:13:41.300 --> 2:13:45.860]  sportscaster makes 30 million dollars a year it's to pacify the man and make

[2:14:02.580 --> 2:14:06.180]  bringing up is the fact that the nr a seven or annual convention in houston
[2:14:06.180 --> 2:14:10.420]  this weekend with a lot of republican uh texas republicans are going to be there
[2:14:10.420 --> 2:14:14.500]  you don't think this was done to demonize the the republic texas republicans
[2:14:14.500 --> 2:14:19.940]  and nr a it's very it's very suspicious timing
[2:14:19.940 --> 2:14:23.860]  and that gear that guy had for what i understand
[2:14:23.860 --> 2:14:27.140]  being interested in guns myself that he had something like three thousand five
[2:14:27.140 --> 2:14:30.580]  hundred dollars worth of a gear there may be more depending on the quality of the
[2:14:30.580 --> 2:14:34.180]  guns so uh how do you get all that money working at
[2:14:34.180 --> 2:14:37.700]  wednesdays yeah and they disappeared at any time
[2:14:37.700 --> 2:14:40.660]  but he was he off somewhere where a communist cell was
[2:14:40.660 --> 2:14:43.700]  training them to get them ready for this i mean yeah he might have been crazy
[2:14:43.700 --> 2:14:47.220]  but he might have been a diehard uh legal you know
[2:14:47.220 --> 2:14:50.660]  an addict john i've been on there 28 years
[2:14:50.660 --> 2:14:53.780]  and you haven't gotten through it in years you've been calling for 20 years
[2:14:53.780 --> 2:14:59.300]  haven't you ever have says 19 just said shortly after the world trade center
[2:14:59.300 --> 2:15:03.300]  20 years 20 plus years all right well god bless you john what else you want to
[2:15:03.300 --> 2:15:06.580]  add brother so that's the only thing is that i like
[2:15:06.580 --> 2:15:09.620]  to hope that the police are going to a thorough investigation but well what
[2:15:09.620 --> 2:15:12.660]  happened in the lost Vegas but he swept everything under the carpet
[2:15:12.660 --> 2:15:16.660]  you never know you know oh i mean everybody should be able to question
[2:15:16.660 --> 2:15:20.340]  this because there's been so many false flags so many provocative operations
[2:15:20.340 --> 2:15:23.540]  again the unabomber was cia that's declassified
[2:15:23.540 --> 2:15:28.180]  mk ultra so it's reasonable to question at all and it's our right to do it and we
[2:15:28.180 --> 2:15:31.780]  should do it but i just think it's just mass brainwashing at this point

[2:21:32.900 --> 2:21:36.740]  i mean i think i think that one of the things that we've got to understand is
[2:21:36.740 --> 2:21:39.140]  what's happening there's been a lot of stuff about this
[2:21:39.140 --> 2:21:43.140]  who uh treaty this who amendment and i think there's a lot of
[2:21:43.140 --> 2:21:47.540]  misunderstanding about it i think so a lot of people are talking
[2:21:47.540 --> 2:21:51.700]  about give up sovereignty and in some senses that's correct but strictly as a
[2:21:51.700 --> 2:21:55.460]  lawyer like that there's a little bit of a misunderstanding there right
[2:21:55.460 --> 2:21:59.860]  so biden no matter how much he wants and i do believe he wants
[2:21:59.860 --> 2:22:04.100]  uh he can't he can't override the constitution so he can't
[2:22:04.100 --> 2:22:08.980]  entirely give away our sovereignty but they know that right the bad guys the
[2:22:08.980 --> 2:22:12.820]  people we're fighting they know that they can't go directly up against the
[2:22:12.820 --> 2:22:16.500]  constitution so they're doing something much more insidious
[2:22:16.500 --> 2:22:21.140]  that i think will have actually i mean i can't say worse consequences but
[2:22:21.140 --> 2:22:25.460]  every bit is bad so alex you know i mean you
[2:22:25.460 --> 2:22:29.140]  cover this stuff all the time you sue the government they throw you out on
[2:22:29.140 --> 2:22:32.820]  standing whether it was election covet uh covet no
[2:22:32.820 --> 2:22:36.100]  matter where you go if they can throw you out they say you don't have standing
[2:22:36.100 --> 2:22:40.500]  right so now imagine if there's a global
[2:22:40.500 --> 2:22:43.940]  administrative agency a global department of health and human
[2:22:43.940 --> 2:22:49.940]  services right the who and not only do you have a heart
[2:22:49.940 --> 2:22:53.940]  you have a hard time suing our government but our government then
[2:22:53.940 --> 2:22:57.380]  agrees to take authority from another bureaucracy
[2:22:57.380 --> 2:23:01.060]  that they're claiming is over their head to sue those guys is
[2:23:01.060 --> 2:23:06.900]  is literally borderline impossible and what biden is doing is he's going to
[2:23:06.900 --> 2:23:11.780]  use his power as the president and his diplomatic
[2:23:11.780 --> 2:23:15.620]  power given to him in the constitution to try and force
[2:23:15.620 --> 2:23:20.180]  who mandates who laws on the american people
[2:23:20.180 --> 2:23:23.540]  for all eternity that's what he's trying to do meanwhile
[2:23:23.540 --> 2:23:28.020]  meanwhile alex and i think this is really where the rubber meets the road on
[2:23:28.020 --> 2:23:31.540]  this if you look at the amendments he's proposing
[2:23:31.540 --> 2:23:35.460]  there's a ton of stuff in there about sharing information
[2:23:35.460 --> 2:23:39.620]  giving who access to to information total violation
[2:23:39.620 --> 2:23:43.380]  of it but i want you to elaborate on this and you're totally right
[2:23:43.380 --> 2:23:47.060]  george herbert walker bush signed on to the treaty in 1992
[2:23:47.060 --> 2:23:50.740]  for agenda 21 the first phase of this congress didn't ratify but the
[2:23:50.740 --> 2:23:55.460]  bureaucracies and then clinton and obama and and bush junior
[2:23:55.460 --> 2:23:58.980]  implemented a lot of it and so you're right it's not legally we're under the
[2:23:58.980 --> 2:24:02.740]  treaty but the bureaucracy our own government
[2:24:02.740 --> 2:24:06.180]  is doing it so if we say oh it's a un treaty it has the authority no
[2:24:06.180 --> 2:24:09.860]  none of it's ratified but the real fight is in our own bureaucracy that
[2:24:09.860 --> 2:24:13.620]  implements it right and and they're going to
[2:24:13.620 --> 2:24:16.900]  implement it it's multiple levels right alex
[2:24:16.900 --> 2:24:21.220]  so you know normally it's hard enough to sue like we're suing the department
[2:24:21.220 --> 2:24:24.100]  of health and human services that's a hard thing to do they well you don't
[2:24:24.100 --> 2:24:28.020]  have standing we're we're sovereign we're immune you can't sue us
[2:24:28.020 --> 2:24:32.900]  right but when you look at this doing it this way what they're doing is they're
[2:24:32.900 --> 2:24:37.300]  creating another bureaucracy and biden's going to claim that he's got
[2:24:37.300 --> 2:24:40.980]  legal authority to follow the direction of this because he's got
[2:24:40.980 --> 2:24:44.660]  constitutional authority for international relations
[2:24:44.660 --> 2:24:48.500]  and so he's going to claim to have authority to follow what they're saying
[2:24:48.500 --> 2:24:53.300]  and then implement through the through his his executive branches
[2:24:53.300 --> 2:24:57.060]  and it's going to make it just a whole another level of things that are
[2:24:57.060 --> 2:25:01.300]  difficult to challenge and meanwhile meanwhile
[2:25:01.300 --> 2:25:04.340]  some of the stuff that he that nobody's going to challenge because they're not
[2:25:04.340 --> 2:25:10.500]  going to notice is super important so this ties in i think in my mind
[2:25:10.500 --> 2:25:13.540]  with a lot of what we're hearing you know you and i talked about too long ago
[2:25:13.540 --> 2:25:17.060]  about you know i'll know a herari in these globalists and the wef and all
[2:25:17.060 --> 2:25:21.860]  this stuff that's happening right well what do they want
[2:25:21.860 --> 2:25:25.140]  well they you know the guys talking about we need to be able to hack people
[2:25:25.140 --> 2:25:29.140]  we need uh for tracking to go under the skin
[2:25:29.140 --> 2:25:34.020]  right they want data well we've got years worth of data that we're
[2:25:34.020 --> 2:25:36.740]  developing that we're pulling from our public health
[2:25:36.740 --> 2:25:40.820]  services they want data to monitor diseases and
[2:25:40.820 --> 2:25:43.540]  outbreaks we know the vaccines are killing us
[2:25:43.540 --> 2:25:46.660]  we know they're behind it all we know they engineered all of it
[2:25:46.660 --> 2:25:50.580]  and that's what's insane yeah we have the data we know what you criminals did
[2:25:50.580 --> 2:25:53.620]  their surveillance data is to track and control us
[2:25:53.620 --> 2:25:57.620]  for the basis of the social credit score the carbon tax which as you know in
[2:25:57.620 --> 2:26:01.380]  the last few days in in in switzerland they've announced all this they've
[2:26:01.380 --> 2:26:06.900]  they've been totally public why do you think they're coming out like this
[2:26:06.900 --> 2:26:11.300]  well i think that it's a lot like a psychopath a serial killer right
[2:26:11.300 --> 2:26:14.660]  i mean you know for some reason serial killers always need to announce how
[2:26:14.660 --> 2:26:18.020]  many people they've killed and brag about it i don't you know i mean i
[2:26:18.020 --> 2:26:21.540]  i don't fully understand the mind of a psychopath but these people are
[2:26:21.540 --> 2:26:25.060]  psychotic anybody that's it it's the basic mo of a psychopath
[2:26:25.060 --> 2:26:28.660]  especially a megalomaniac dr ebel type that they gotta tell you what they're
[2:26:28.660 --> 2:26:33.060]  doing to you yeah yeah i mean i they can't stop bragging
[2:26:33.060 --> 2:26:36.900]  about it i mean you literally have an advisor to the head of the world
[2:26:36.900 --> 2:26:40.580]  economic forum telling you that he wants to enslave humanity by
[2:26:40.580 --> 2:26:42.980]  getting rid of free will that it's an illusion
[2:26:42.980 --> 2:26:46.500]  he's telling you that he's he's you know joseph and they're gonna take your free
[2:26:46.500 --> 2:26:50.180]  speech and they're gonna force inject you and they own your bodies and we're
[2:26:50.180 --> 2:26:54.580]  and freedom is over these are all quotes we play yesterday
[2:26:54.580 --> 2:26:57.940]  yeah i mean they're saying it we can't you listen
[2:26:57.940 --> 2:27:03.060]  do you should we discount the fact that a serial killer is telling you he's
[2:27:03.060 --> 2:27:06.660]  gonna kill a hundred person people just because it sounds bizarre
[2:27:06.660 --> 2:27:10.020]  i mean these guys are psychotic they're telling us what they're gonna do
[2:27:10.020 --> 2:27:13.780]  and they've got the power and money to do a lot of it are we gonna just say you
[2:27:13.780 --> 2:27:16.740]  know that's a conspiracy theory it sounds far out
[2:27:16.740 --> 2:27:20.180]  that you'll all know harari is saying that he wants to hack humans that free
[2:27:20.180 --> 2:27:23.780]  wills an illusion it sounds far out that couldn't be
[2:27:23.780 --> 2:27:27.700]  well i mean listen he's advising bill gates
[2:27:27.700 --> 2:27:30.500]  a swab all these guys they're sitting there listening
[2:27:30.500 --> 2:27:34.180]  they're telling us what makes the statements about free wills over
[2:27:34.180 --> 2:27:37.140]  you'll own nothing you'll have nothing we're gonna put chips in your body
[2:27:37.140 --> 2:27:42.900]  hell forget harari swabs is at all yeah yeah i mean so these guys are telling
[2:27:42.900 --> 2:27:47.140]  us what they're gonna do and yet we're trying we're debating over
[2:27:47.140 --> 2:27:50.900]  whether or not we should believe it because it sounds far out i agree it
[2:27:50.900 --> 2:27:54.260]  sounds far out let's put them in a metal ward and
[2:27:54.260 --> 2:27:58.100]  exactly it's perfectly said and then they have corporate media say no one
[2:27:58.100 --> 2:28:02.020]  wants world government no one wants cyborgs no one wants to put chips in you

[2:34:28.100 --> 2:34:31.540]  so i want to put a bug in your alex i don't know if you've thought about this
[2:34:31.540 --> 2:34:34.820]  right i haven't seen it anywhere else one of the key
[2:34:34.820 --> 2:34:39.140]  provisions of this amendment or these amendments that they're proposing
[2:34:39.140 --> 2:34:44.020]  was sharing of information you and or who people can come in and they can look
[2:34:44.020 --> 2:34:47.940]  at the information we can share it with them and so on so forth
[2:34:47.940 --> 2:34:52.660]  you know if you look at both china and these you know these globalists they've
[2:34:52.660 --> 2:34:56.180]  all been talking about getting our data and i don't know if you remember this
[2:34:56.180 --> 2:34:59.860]  alex but a number of months ago there were some stories came out about them
[2:34:59.860 --> 2:35:04.020]  selling the dna data and the genetic data from the pcr test to china and to
[2:35:04.020 --> 2:35:08.180]  some of these other places imagine now that we have electronic
[2:35:08.180 --> 2:35:12.260]  medical white records thanks to obama care and that now that the government
[2:35:12.260 --> 2:35:16.100]  has all this data on us imagine what happens when we just
[2:35:16.100 --> 2:35:21.220]  give all that data to to these these monsters at the who
[2:35:21.220 --> 2:35:24.340]  who are controlled by china who are controlled by big pharma they're
[2:35:24.340 --> 2:35:29.220]  controlled by you know these globalists so
[2:35:29.220 --> 2:35:32.580]  i think that's one of nobody's even going to notice
[2:35:32.580 --> 2:35:36.180]  nobody's going to care because these guys are going to come in
[2:35:36.180 --> 2:35:39.620]  it's not like biden's going to make an announcement he's sharing your
[2:35:39.620 --> 2:35:42.900]  genetic data that is sharing all your medical data
[2:35:42.900 --> 2:35:46.020]  he's just going to do it and so nobody's even going to notice and it's the same
[2:35:46.020 --> 2:35:49.540]  thing that we've seen with our privacy as it's been eroded by big tech
[2:35:49.540 --> 2:35:53.940]  nobody really knows how much they have on us but they're using everything they
[2:35:53.940 --> 2:35:57.380]  have on us to control us it's part of the surveillance state
[2:35:57.380 --> 2:36:00.980]  now they're going to go in and take our personal medical information
[2:36:00.980 --> 2:36:04.100]  and that i think is one of the most dangerous aspects
[2:36:04.100 --> 2:36:07.140]  of this treaty all right that's key that's in that's in the that's in the
[2:36:07.140 --> 2:36:09.780]  draft treaty you're right no one's talking about that they're not just
[2:36:09.780 --> 2:36:13.300]  claiming ownership of your body but your data
[2:36:13.300 --> 2:36:17.620]  yeah well and remember remember alex we've got
[2:36:17.620 --> 2:36:23.700]  we've got paperwork on historic work that's been done between china and
[2:36:23.700 --> 2:36:28.020]  israel regarding genetic specific diseases that
[2:36:28.020 --> 2:36:32.980]  start the target certain genetic signatures that are related to
[2:36:32.980 --> 2:36:37.220]  specific races race specific bio weapons
[2:36:37.220 --> 2:36:41.140]  yeah yeah and all sorts of other things here's here's the bottom line
[2:36:41.140 --> 2:36:44.180]  what are they going to do with it i can't prove that
[2:36:44.180 --> 2:36:49.700]  what i know is this if claus Schwab in china want my dna data i don't want them
[2:36:49.700 --> 2:36:53.460]  to have it it's just that simple i'll tell you the good news
[2:36:53.460 --> 2:36:57.220]  eclipse being pulled in right now we'll play it before the segment ends
[2:36:57.220 --> 2:37:00.340]  they're spending half their time at this devos event we got reporters there
[2:37:00.340 --> 2:37:03.460]  some entered in as in others reporting from fours dot com
[2:37:03.460 --> 2:37:06.980]  they're obsessing on we got a censor room they're after us
[2:37:06.980 --> 2:37:10.820]  they're they're vaccine critics well it's our bodies and it's not a vaccine
[2:37:10.820 --> 2:37:16.660]  it's a gene therapy and it doesn't work well listen i mean you saw uh what's
[2:37:16.660 --> 2:37:20.500]  his name the Pfizer guy say listen there's plenty of doses it's not a
[2:37:20.500 --> 2:37:24.980]  supply chain issue he says the americans just don't want it they won't take it
[2:37:24.980 --> 2:37:28.900]  that's true that's the truth and oh yeah Pfizer and madern have said it let me
[2:37:28.900 --> 2:37:31.540]  back you up with that here's the cope covid
[2:37:31.540 --> 2:37:36.180]  headlines today mass die off such a key article and it's in british
[2:37:36.180 --> 2:37:39.220]  governments on emissions like you were on a month ago talking about this but now
[2:37:39.220 --> 2:37:45.140]  it's confirmed close to 180 000 people died within 60 days of covid 19 vaccine
[2:37:45.140 --> 2:37:51.140]  england statistic office makes stunning admission bob shell this video it's on
[2:37:51.140 --> 2:37:54.500]  enforce.com CNN admits mRNA vaccine may be
[2:37:54.500 --> 2:37:57.940]  adversely affecting immunity really they warned about it beforehand
[2:37:57.940 --> 2:38:01.460]  maderna ceo limits throwing 30 million doses in the garbage
[2:38:01.460 --> 2:38:04.420]  because nobody wants them that's what you just mentioned
[2:38:04.420 --> 2:38:09.300]  billionaires at war elon must deepens few with bill gates it goes on and on and
[2:38:09.300 --> 2:38:14.260]  on oh the quest CNN reports the quest for a longer lasting covid vaccine
[2:38:14.260 --> 2:38:17.220]  because it's not a vaccine it doesn't even work two months
[2:38:17.220 --> 2:38:20.420]  it destroys your immune system i mean these guys are crazy
[2:38:20.420 --> 2:38:25.460]  they've committed a crime so big they believe we won't be able to even
[2:38:25.460 --> 2:38:32.340]  process it. Alex we reported in june of 2021
[2:38:32.340 --> 2:38:36.820]  that there had been 45 000 deaths from the jab
[2:38:36.820 --> 2:38:39.860]  according to it just within the social security database
[2:38:39.860 --> 2:38:44.420]  or i'm sorry the medicare medicaid database we reported that back then
[2:38:44.420 --> 2:38:47.860]  it made all sorts of headlines they've been covering this up they know what's
[2:38:47.860 --> 2:38:50.740]  going on they're acutely aware of how many people are dying
[2:38:50.740 --> 2:38:56.340]  the mRNA technology facilitates your body producing the spike protein which is a
[2:38:56.340 --> 2:38:59.380]  pathogen we know that we also know that through a
[2:38:59.380 --> 2:39:04.260]  process called reverse transcription this has the potential to make you a
[2:39:04.260 --> 2:39:07.860]  permanent GMO a permanent genetically modified
[2:39:07.860 --> 2:39:10.900]  organism does it happen to everybody
[2:39:10.900 --> 2:39:15.300]  no how often does it happen we don't know the date is not there
[2:39:15.300 --> 2:39:19.460]  but is it happening well it certainly appears to be a good percentage of people
[2:39:19.460 --> 2:39:24.260]  have spike protein take over their body and take over their DNA
[2:39:24.260 --> 2:39:27.860]  listen Alex once your body starts producing this you're permanently
[2:39:27.860 --> 2:39:30.900]  producing a pathogen or at least as long as this
[2:39:30.900 --> 2:39:34.500]  vaccine's impacting your body we you know this
[2:39:34.500 --> 2:39:40.900]  this pathogen is causing just absolutely unimaginable damage
[2:39:40.900 --> 2:39:44.900]  and you know it's it's so many unintended adverse things do you notice
[2:39:44.900 --> 2:39:48.420]  how they had the big thing about hepatitis in kids and then it disappeared
[2:39:48.420 --> 2:39:51.940]  immediately well let me tell you why it disappeared
[2:39:51.940 --> 2:39:56.500]  hepatitis is listed as an adverse event of special interest in the Pfizer
[2:39:56.500 --> 2:39:59.940]  documents it's the Pfizer vaccine that was causing it
[2:39:59.940 --> 2:40:03.860]  and but they by the way they said oh the only thing we can find is adrenovirus
[2:40:03.860 --> 2:40:08.340]  well guess what adrenovirus is all pneumonia is also listed as an
[2:40:08.340 --> 2:40:11.620]  adverse event of special interest then they said well maybe the some of these
[2:40:11.620 --> 2:40:14.500]  kids might not have been faxed well guess what
[2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:18.580]  i've got the common already approval letter from the FDA
[2:40:18.580 --> 2:40:23.860]  where Pfizer agreed to run a study that was based on it's called
[2:40:23.860 --> 2:40:29.780]  the study design was called uh what was it uh
[2:40:29.780 --> 2:40:33.940]  shedding and uh and other issues related to
[2:40:33.940 --> 2:40:37.220]  to gene therapy products it was something to that effect but they
[2:40:37.220 --> 2:40:40.980]  it literally in the study title referenced that this was
[2:40:40.980 --> 2:40:44.340]  to study shedding and gene therapy product incredible we'll talk about it
[2:40:44.340 --> 2:40:48.020]  next segment and and we also have all these other admissions
[2:40:48.020 --> 2:40:50.660]  Greg Reese's report today the truth about monkey box
[2:40:50.660 --> 2:40:54.340]  is so powerful he shows the documents mainline studies
[2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:58.900]  that the vaccine for monkey pox causes the monkey pox
[2:40:58.900 --> 2:41:03.460]  in the electron microscope studies that's there but here's a clip
[2:41:03.460 --> 2:41:07.940]  today of the head of Pfizer with his cohort claus Schwab
[2:41:07.940 --> 2:41:11.940]  saying the as the targets of the at vaccine crowd
[2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:15.700]  the i'm just here it is with the vaccine
[2:41:15.700 --> 2:41:22.740]  but we knew that there's a very fanatic group of anti-vaxxers
[2:41:22.740 --> 2:41:27.460]  that will go after us no matter what they will claim that the sun didn't go up
[2:41:27.460 --> 2:41:31.860]  because people were vaccinated and that created issues with the crop
[2:41:31.860 --> 2:41:35.220]  so i'm suing you and one thing it is to sue you in the us
[2:41:35.220 --> 2:41:39.220]  another thing is to sue you in a country where the legal system
[2:41:39.220 --> 2:41:42.500]  is not up to that standards or in switzerland right
[2:41:42.500 --> 2:41:46.740]  so i think that's behind us uh everything
[2:41:46.740 --> 2:41:52.100]  went okay and now i think we can move on i think we were we were both
[2:41:52.100 --> 2:41:59.940]  targets of the anti-vaccine movements and conspiracy people
[2:41:59.940 --> 2:42:03.780]  claiming that i had tripled i wondered what it is
[2:42:03.780 --> 2:42:10.820]  triple uh uh covid um yeah and something
[2:42:10.820 --> 2:42:16.180]  well was i think you got hundreds of thousands of clicks and so on
[2:42:16.180 --> 2:42:20.260]  i know you were also target i read one day
[2:42:20.260 --> 2:42:24.820]  that was arrested by fbi yeah same happened to me and there are pictures
[2:42:24.820 --> 2:42:27.700]  pictures of me and fbi officers i don't know how
[2:42:27.700 --> 2:42:32.340]  yeah i never said the surprising thing it is that the same public case
[2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:36.500]  i found out because i had published the previous one of that was arrested was
[2:42:36.500 --> 2:42:41.700]  the pope by fbi so ridiculous yeah so we are
[2:42:41.700 --> 2:42:46.180]  good company yeah well at least i was in good company
[2:42:46.180 --> 2:42:50.260]  but so what they do is they put out the disinfo themselves they're mass
[2:42:50.260 --> 2:42:55.780]  murdering criminals and no you're not the target you are the target

[2:44:02.820 --> 2:44:06.900]  why is it from Chiapas Mexico the communist well that's where some of the
[2:44:06.900 --> 2:44:09.700]  best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[2:44:09.700 --> 2:44:13.220]  above organic in the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee
[2:44:13.220 --> 2:44:16.340]  and yeah we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls
[2:44:16.340 --> 2:44:19.220]  communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is
[2:44:19.220 --> 2:44:22.420]  that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican
[2:44:22.420 --> 2:44:25.140]  government take over so i actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and i've
[2:44:25.140 --> 2:44:27.940]  been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same
[2:44:27.940 --> 2:44:31.460]  stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more for
[2:44:31.460 --> 2:44:34.020]  pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find

[2:47:35.940 --> 2:47:41.140]  and that it belongs to them but it doesn't belong to them and we're gonna
[2:47:41.140 --> 2:47:44.820]  fight back and we're gonna win our enemies are out in the open and they
[2:47:44.820 --> 2:47:47.060]  put out all this disinfo about themselves and
[2:47:47.060 --> 2:47:50.100]  point to that no we have the facts that clauslaw brags
[2:47:50.100 --> 2:47:53.220]  he's penetrated our governments he's taken them over and he doesn't care what
[2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:56.980]  the people say he's gonna rule us well he's not
[2:47:56.980 --> 2:48:01.700]  and he's been identified just like mainstream media ignores the fact they
[2:48:01.700 --> 2:48:04.020]  have no ratings and no viewers everybody hates them
[2:48:04.020 --> 2:48:07.140]  they just keep being funded by the big banks
[2:48:07.140 --> 2:48:10.180]  they don't give up but they've already lost
[2:48:10.180 --> 2:48:15.220]  thomas rins is a powerful brain a great lawyer and fighting with so many
[2:48:15.220 --> 2:48:17.860]  lawsuits on so many fronts let's hit these other
[2:48:17.860 --> 2:48:23.460]  points more on the monkey epochs the who pushing for permanent lockdowns
[2:48:23.460 --> 2:48:26.420]  that was announced they said oh we said we were wrong before but now we want them
[2:48:26.420 --> 2:48:28.980]  again and building for covet part two give us your
[2:48:28.980 --> 2:48:33.460]  take on that well let me let me open up with one
[2:48:33.460 --> 2:48:37.060]  thing super important now it's i want to respond to that last clip that you just
[2:48:37.060 --> 2:48:41.140]  played because those two arrogant pieces of garbage
[2:48:41.140 --> 2:48:44.740]  that are out there telling us what they're gonna do and laughing about their
[2:48:44.740 --> 2:48:48.340]  being in good company i got a message for you guys
[2:48:48.340 --> 2:48:52.980]  i'm a nobody from a little town in ohio and me and a whole bunch of other
[2:48:52.980 --> 2:48:56.340]  nobodies from little places in the united states
[2:48:56.340 --> 2:49:00.740]  has stood up and we are at a much lower rate of vaccination than you ever
[2:49:00.740 --> 2:49:04.580]  thought we would be you thought you were going to take us over you didn't know
[2:49:04.580 --> 2:49:09.060]  we nobodies we are the resistance we the people
[2:49:09.060 --> 2:49:12.980]  thanks to alex jones we have a voice thanks to people like that we have a
[2:49:12.980 --> 2:49:16.980]  voice and let me tell you you scumbags i don't care if it takes the rest of my
[2:49:16.980 --> 2:49:19.940]  life i made a promise before god that i would do
[2:49:19.940 --> 2:49:22.980]  my best to fight this as long as he allowed me to do it
[2:49:22.980 --> 2:49:27.540]  and i will continue and yipping at your heels until i eat the ground out from
[2:49:27.540 --> 2:49:31.540]  under you and you are in jail and i will laugh every day for the rest of my life
[2:49:31.540 --> 2:49:35.380]  while you're sitting there absolutely listen to me to know
[2:49:35.380 --> 2:49:38.180]  you're you're right they they have told us we're nobodies
[2:49:38.180 --> 2:49:41.700]  they've told us we're going down no they're going down
[2:49:41.700 --> 2:49:45.860]  those arrogant pieces of garbage they will be held accountable
[2:49:45.860 --> 2:49:50.260]  for the deaths that i have to look at every day in my email box the pictures
[2:49:50.260 --> 2:49:54.740]  sent to me a loved ones who are dying you scumbags you may think we're nothing
[2:49:54.740 --> 2:49:58.660]  but i'll tell you what we are is we are relentless and we've got god on our back
[2:49:58.660 --> 2:50:02.420]  you will go down as far as your other stuff
[2:50:02.420 --> 2:50:06.580]  the monkeypox let me tell you what so we've got
[2:50:06.580 --> 2:50:10.260]  and i just put it on my substack i just put out a substack today to get ready
[2:50:10.260 --> 2:50:14.260]  to talk to you uh we've got they've done gain a function
[2:50:14.260 --> 2:50:18.260]  on monkeypox so monkeypox normally doesn't spread very easy
[2:50:18.260 --> 2:50:22.420]  and i'm hoping it doesn't spread very easy here but here's the thing
[2:50:22.420 --> 2:50:26.580]  they've they've got the exact same scenario happening with the monkeypox
[2:50:26.580 --> 2:50:29.780]  that they had with covid they you know they ran their simulations they've been
[2:50:29.780 --> 2:50:33.220]  planning for it they've been building up fear all this nonsense
[2:50:33.220 --> 2:50:37.860]  so here's my question is the monkeypox that's running around now
[2:50:37.860 --> 2:50:41.620]  is this at natural monkeypox or is this another gain a function
[2:50:41.620 --> 2:50:45.300]  oops release right i and we don't know that yet
[2:50:45.300 --> 2:50:50.260]  we don't know i'll tell you it's hard saying what's going to happen because
[2:50:50.260 --> 2:50:52.900]  you know they're they ran their simulations they're doing everything
[2:50:52.900 --> 2:50:56.580]  just like covid and so we got to ask the other thing we've got a
[2:50:56.580 --> 2:51:00.340]  that's really a variable here is you know we
[2:51:00.340 --> 2:51:04.100]  we know mccullough just published a great paper
[2:51:04.100 --> 2:51:08.100]  on you know some of the impacts these covid jabs
[2:51:08.100 --> 2:51:12.500]  the covid jabs screw with your immune system and it's possible
[2:51:12.500 --> 2:51:18.020]  not proven but possible that the way that it affects your immune system may
[2:51:18.020 --> 2:51:22.500]  make people who are jabbed more susceptible to these monkeypox
[2:51:22.500 --> 2:51:27.700]  so even if it is the natural strain does it spread faster
[2:51:27.700 --> 2:51:31.300]  and here's the thing if this was natural why is joe biden why are all these
[2:51:31.300 --> 2:51:34.260]  people concerned about it why are you running simulations
[2:51:34.260 --> 2:51:38.820]  if there's no you know monkeypox they discovered that and i think the 1950s
[2:51:38.820 --> 2:51:42.100]  it's been out forever why all of a sudden do we care what's changed well
[2:51:42.100 --> 2:51:45.460]  everybody's been jabbed and you've been doing gain of function research
[2:51:45.460 --> 2:51:49.140]  so do you care because you've been doing gain of function research and you
[2:51:49.140 --> 2:51:53.300]  and people have been jabbed or you know is there something that we're missing
[2:51:53.300 --> 2:51:56.900]  there's no reason to make a deal out of a disease that old
[2:51:56.900 --> 2:52:00.340]  and there's no reason our cdc has already bought
[2:52:00.340 --> 2:52:04.980]  probably billions of dollars worth of this garbage vaccine that probably has
[2:52:04.980 --> 2:52:08.740]  mrna tack in it and all sorts of gene therapy garbage we don't know what's in
[2:52:08.740 --> 2:52:13.140]  there but if you trust pharma to produce anything that's legitimate well
[2:52:13.140 --> 2:52:17.140]  you know i got a bridge for you to buy so that's right what they've done is
[2:52:17.140 --> 2:52:20.260]  they are making their mad scientist move right now
[2:52:20.260 --> 2:52:24.340]  they are claiming ownership of our data of our bodies of our speech
[2:52:24.340 --> 2:52:29.060]  of our children of our banks of our currency of our nations of our borders
[2:52:29.060 --> 2:52:33.380]  of our god this is a full spectrum takeover
[2:52:33.380 --> 2:52:37.140]  it absolutely is and you know the question is
[2:52:37.140 --> 2:52:40.820]  is monkeypox a false flag is it just something they're talking about
[2:52:40.820 --> 2:52:44.260]  or is this something i mean in light of what you're following all the same
[2:52:44.260 --> 2:52:49.540]  previous propaganda of 27 months ago absolutely and i wrote about
[2:52:49.540 --> 2:52:54.100]  alex you know what i just the other day i looked at uh the first case i filed
[2:52:54.100 --> 2:52:59.300]  in and that case was well the first major case i filed on covid i filed it
[2:52:59.300 --> 2:53:05.060]  beginning of september of 2020 if you read the fact pattern in that case
[2:53:05.060 --> 2:53:09.300]  you'd think i was a stinking prophet because everything in there has been
[2:53:09.300 --> 2:53:12.660]  proven to be accurate and it's very slowly leaked out oh
[2:53:12.660 --> 2:53:16.580]  you know this was correct oh that was correct you know listen it's not that
[2:53:16.580 --> 2:53:20.500]  they didn't know they just lied they lied through their teeth
[2:53:20.500 --> 2:53:24.340]  the media was complicit they covered this up the media could pull up
[2:53:24.340 --> 2:53:27.540]  the document that showed that they were defrauding the american public on the
[2:53:27.540 --> 2:53:31.380]  number of deaths related to covid which by the way they still are
[2:53:31.380 --> 2:53:34.980]  you know that the media could pull this up we made it public we put it out there
[2:53:34.980 --> 2:53:39.300]  all paid off so so here's here's what i'm getting at
[2:53:39.300 --> 2:53:43.540]  what you said is true they admit no one's buying it no one's taking everybody's
[2:53:43.540 --> 2:53:47.780]  turning against them so they bring monkeypox in to create more hysteria
[2:53:47.780 --> 2:53:52.340]  they they snuck attack like evil always does and always has a head start
[2:53:52.340 --> 2:53:56.900]  but in the end humanity's catching up to them
[2:53:56.900 --> 2:54:01.860]  yeah we are we are but that's why you know that's why my ugly mug is on your
[2:54:01.860 --> 2:54:04.580]  show right because we've got to inform people
[2:54:04.580 --> 2:54:08.420]  we got to get the word out you know so the who has said
[2:54:08.420 --> 2:54:12.900]  they want these permanent lockdowns we know claus schwaab all these guys they
[2:54:12.900 --> 2:54:16.020]  talked about how do you destabilize the planet how do you get the second
[2:54:16.020 --> 2:54:19.300]  industrial or fourth industrial revolution or whatever
[2:54:19.300 --> 2:54:23.700]  i mean what they need to do is keep people unstable keep causing
[2:54:23.700 --> 2:54:29.380]  chaos keep sowing strife and he says the angrier world will destabilize the
[2:54:29.380 --> 2:54:33.700]  old system and false adoption of the new system
[2:54:33.700 --> 2:54:37.780]  i love your impression by the way that's my favorite impression of schwaab
[2:54:37.780 --> 2:54:41.860]  but that's a quote that's a quote of him i mean it's he it's it's insane
[2:54:41.860 --> 2:54:47.380]  i know i know so what do they do look at this
[2:54:47.380 --> 2:54:51.300]  they are attacking us not just in covid but everywhere look at what they're
[2:54:51.300 --> 2:54:54.580]  doing to our kids in schools they're screwing with their mental
[2:54:54.580 --> 2:54:56.980]  health on a way that they're never going to recover
[2:54:56.980 --> 2:55:00.500]  look what they're doing to our military you know they're poisoning them with
[2:55:00.500 --> 2:55:03.380]  these jabs and using it for social experimentation
[2:55:03.380 --> 2:55:06.820]  look what they're doing you know with the elections look what they're doing
[2:55:06.820 --> 2:55:10.340]  you show me one part of our society that's not under attack
[2:55:10.340 --> 2:55:13.620]  it's all about destabilization in the monkeypox
[2:55:13.620 --> 2:55:17.060]  you know if it's not the monkeypox we already know they're talking about the
[2:55:17.060 --> 2:55:21.540]  next new variant for covid you know there's going to be a next thing
[2:55:21.540 --> 2:55:25.060]  they're not giving this up and we either defeat this evil
[2:55:25.060 --> 2:55:28.580]  or it will continue coming after us and that's right they're getting us into a
[2:55:28.580 --> 2:55:31.300]  rhythm of lockdowns and surveillance and forced
[2:55:31.300 --> 2:55:34.100]  injection they're getting us into the new normal
[2:55:34.100 --> 2:55:38.820]  in their own words we can't let them do that well and let's not overlook the
[2:55:38.820 --> 2:55:41.620]  summer rage i did another sub stack i talked
[2:55:41.620 --> 2:55:44.340]  about the summer rage and i think you've talked about this
[2:55:44.340 --> 2:55:49.780]  if you search abortion and and summer of rage on google

[2:56:00.260 --> 2:56:03.540]  all these you know these guys weren't protesters these were rioters these were
[2:56:03.540 --> 2:56:06.900]  professional disruptors they've got to continue fighting to
[2:56:06.900 --> 2:56:10.980]  destabilize our nation this is all part of the same plan
[2:56:10.980 --> 2:56:15.460]  to attack freedom and to attack our giant central banks with unlimited money
[2:56:15.460 --> 2:56:19.700]  to rebuild but in their image and just trying to force the collapse

[3:00:18.500 --> 3:00:22.260]  fraud it seems to be put on the on the
[3:00:22.260 --> 3:00:25.860]  back burner while we have events going on in the nation
[3:00:25.860 --> 3:00:29.380]  but i also have some questions about those events too
[3:00:29.380 --> 3:00:33.300]  and the problem is that i was trying to construct a timeline
[3:00:33.300 --> 3:00:38.100]  for uh for radio to try to explain to people what happened
[3:00:38.100 --> 3:00:42.180]  the only problem i'm running up against with what happened in texas
[3:00:42.180 --> 3:00:48.260]  is the timeline and as horrific as those events sound and and you know all of
[3:00:48.260 --> 3:00:52.340]  course all america is concerned about the families
[3:00:52.340 --> 3:00:56.660]  what happened to these children i have to say that the timeline is a little
[3:00:56.660 --> 3:01:00.820]  disconcerting before we get to my two guests for election fraud
[3:01:00.820 --> 3:01:04.980]  i just wanted to kind of give you why an example of why i'm
[3:01:04.980 --> 3:01:08.420]  i'm finding it really hard to construct a timeline
[3:01:08.420 --> 3:01:15.860]  at 1117 the school district put out a message that the school had an active
[3:01:15.860 --> 3:01:20.740]  shooter this was 1117 and so at 1117 they put this
[3:01:20.740 --> 3:01:24.980]  message out and that everything was fine
[3:01:24.980 --> 3:01:28.580]  except that they had had this event happening
[3:01:28.580 --> 3:01:34.580]  okay it happened then the authorities say that at 1132
[3:01:34.580 --> 3:01:40.180]  10 minutes later okay more than 10 minutes more like 15 minutes later the
[3:01:40.180 --> 3:01:44.980]  authorities say that the school shooter then entered the building
[3:01:44.980 --> 3:01:48.580]  which i thought was really strange because by the time a school district
[3:01:48.580 --> 3:01:52.260]  writes the message you know shooter in the building
[3:01:52.260 --> 3:01:55.700]  then what's strange is that it would take a little bit to get there so i'm
[3:01:55.700 --> 3:02:01.460]  probably guessing maybe at around 1110 something like that in 11
[3:02:01.460 --> 3:02:05.060]  okay so i just wanted to mention that 1132
[3:02:05.060 --> 3:02:12.100]  and then of course at 1143 they said that the school the elementary school
[3:02:12.100 --> 3:02:15.700]  tweeted out that that the school had some shots
[3:02:15.700 --> 3:02:18.980]  and gunfire outside but everyone inside the school was fine
[3:02:18.980 --> 3:02:22.980]  but the shooting was supposed to be happening then for an hour and a half
[3:02:22.980 --> 3:02:25.940]  and a shootout was supposed to be happening at that point when the
[3:02:25.940 --> 3:02:31.140]  elementary school sent that out a little strange a little strange
[3:02:31.140 --> 3:02:34.900]  so the timeline is very very weird i might talk about that a little bit more
[3:02:34.900 --> 3:02:39.060]  inside the show but it was just very strange and the timeline for some reason
[3:02:39.060 --> 3:02:42.980]  is not working out i don't know who was not talking to whom or what it was
[3:02:42.980 --> 3:02:47.140]  happening here but it just seemed a little strange
[3:02:47.140 --> 3:02:53.140]  my guest my first guest for for talking about election fraud which we really
[3:02:53.140 --> 3:02:56.740]  do need to keep an eye on right now is
[3:02:56.740 --> 3:03:00.740]  sheriff mac sheriff mac joins me and sheriff mac is
[3:03:00.740 --> 3:03:05.780]  the president of constitutional sheriffs and peace officers association
[3:03:05.780 --> 3:03:09.700]  and welcome to the show sheriff mac how are you
[3:03:09.700 --> 3:03:13.300]  thank you so much kate it's great to be back with you and
[3:03:13.300 --> 3:03:19.380]  it's great to be back on info wars absolutely thank you for joining me
[3:03:19.380 --> 3:03:24.100]  it's an important matter that's being swept aside for today's media coverage
[3:03:24.100 --> 3:03:28.420]  which today's media coverage is important but so is election fraud
[3:03:28.420 --> 3:03:32.500]  and here is the here is the situation we have a movie 2000 mules i've
[3:03:32.500 --> 3:03:36.340]  interviewed katherine i've interviewed dinesh and this movie is is
[3:03:36.340 --> 3:03:40.340]  important it's a huge huge tool and to understand
[3:03:40.340 --> 3:03:43.300]  what this fraud's all about we only have a minute till we go to break
[3:03:43.300 --> 3:03:47.380]  but we are going to come back and talk about this for a moment and i just wanted
[3:03:47.380 --> 3:03:52.580]  to understand what what the constitutional sheriffs are
[3:03:52.580 --> 3:03:57.140]  saying about this movie this extraordinary piece of evidence about
[3:03:57.140 --> 3:04:00.980]  election fraud well i made the mistake of watching the
[3:04:00.980 --> 3:04:04.180]  movie and and i say mistake because now it
[3:04:04.180 --> 3:04:09.380]  puts a responsibility on us and every sheriff in the country every
[3:04:09.380 --> 3:04:16.740]  peace officer every state police agency the evidence now
[3:04:16.740 --> 3:04:21.140]  is stark and right in our face and i really didn't make
[3:04:21.140 --> 3:04:24.820]  this issue a top priority of the csp away
[3:04:24.820 --> 3:04:29.620]  but because of this movie i now am doing exactly that
[3:04:29.620 --> 3:04:33.620]  all of our members are saying the same thing
[3:04:33.620 --> 3:04:37.380]  this evidence is too compelling to ignore
[3:04:37.380 --> 3:04:40.980]  right we're going to come right back more with sheriff mac when we come back
[3:04:40.980 --> 3:04:44.900]  the constitutional sheriffs and peace officers association so glad to have

[3:06:10.340 --> 3:06:13.620]  side in america today that still need to be talked about
[3:06:13.620 --> 3:06:19.940]  and there still is a obvious huge massive concern for our voting system
[3:06:19.940 --> 3:06:23.780]  which is truly what we should be feeling right now
[3:06:23.780 --> 3:06:27.300]  um we have a whole system that has fallen apart and we need to do something
[3:06:27.300 --> 3:06:30.900]  about it my guest is for this segment of the show is
[3:06:30.900 --> 3:06:35.780]  richard mac sheriff richard mac he also is the former sheriff of gram county
[3:06:35.780 --> 3:06:40.180]  arizona political activist he's known for a role in a successful lawsuit
[3:06:40.180 --> 3:06:43.380]  brought against the federal government of united states which alleged the
[3:06:43.380 --> 3:06:47.380]  portions of the brady handgun violence prevention act violated the united
[3:06:47.380 --> 3:06:50.980]  states constitution welcome back he is also
[3:06:50.980 --> 3:06:54.820]  the head of constitutional sheriffs and peace officers association
[3:06:54.820 --> 3:06:59.220]  and so let's pick up where we just left off sheriff mac so appreciate you being
[3:06:59.220 --> 3:07:04.820]  on with me of course um but we there's a huge effort right now to make sure
[3:07:04.820 --> 3:07:08.580]  that people understand the evidence the evidence
[3:07:08.580 --> 3:07:12.820]  behind voter fraud and it's a massive amount of evidence mules
[3:07:12.820 --> 3:07:15.780]  kind of like drug trafficking which you're probably
[3:07:15.780 --> 3:07:21.860]  well familiar with being in arizona um how the mules for the election trafficking
[3:07:21.860 --> 3:07:26.020]  have certainly um have certainly been part of this massive
[3:07:26.020 --> 3:07:32.660]  amount of evidence yes yeah it is and and you know it's kind of funny
[3:07:32.660 --> 3:07:39.460]  uh i actually predicted before the election uh that
[3:07:39.460 --> 3:07:42.900]  the democrats would do anything in everything
[3:07:42.900 --> 3:07:45.780]  anything and everything lie cheat still and murder
[3:07:45.780 --> 3:07:50.500]  yeah and i'm not kidding i believe they have committed murder and i believe
[3:07:50.500 --> 3:07:54.100]  they would be willing to commit murder to make sure
[3:07:54.100 --> 3:07:59.460]  that they would not allow uh donald trump back in the white house
[3:07:59.460 --> 3:08:04.020]  in fact they basically tried to to assassinate his character
[3:08:04.020 --> 3:08:10.900]  for five years i'm not a big trump fan when he makes mistakes i point him out
[3:08:10.900 --> 3:08:14.580]  when he does something good i point him out comparatively speaking
[3:08:14.580 --> 3:08:18.660]  with other presidents especially compared to the one that's in there now
[3:08:18.660 --> 3:08:23.380]  uh he was uh one of the best presidents in american history
[3:08:23.380 --> 3:08:28.340]  uh and far better than anything the democrats have put in there in a
[3:08:28.340 --> 3:08:32.820]  long long time especially the destruction uh the
[3:08:32.820 --> 3:08:37.700]  destroyer of american liberty that's in there now but i predicted this i said
[3:08:37.700 --> 3:08:41.220]  that they would do anything and everything and that and it's obvious
[3:08:41.220 --> 3:08:47.220]  that they did but okay i did not see any evidence
[3:08:47.220 --> 3:08:52.980]  where we could start investigating uh i did not make it an issue of the csp way
[3:08:52.980 --> 3:08:55.700]  to get all the sheriffs in the country to start
[3:08:55.700 --> 3:08:59.460]  investigating this a couple of sheriffs and csp away
[3:08:59.460 --> 3:09:03.460]  sheriffs started some of their own investigations
[3:09:03.460 --> 3:09:08.100]  sheriff dar leaf in michigan has been doing this for two years he's been
[3:09:08.100 --> 3:09:12.660]  stonewalled at every uh corner that he turns
[3:09:12.660 --> 3:09:17.860]  however now the susan comes out with this movie
[3:09:17.860 --> 3:09:22.420]  people kept telling me to watch it i wasn't interested in watching it
[3:09:22.420 --> 3:09:30.340]  finally i said okay send it to me i'll watch it i watched it and i'm not and
[3:09:30.340 --> 3:09:34.900]  i'm not saying that it's completely true uh let's
[3:09:34.900 --> 3:09:39.540]  just go and arrest everybody no i'm not saying that at all
[3:09:39.540 --> 3:09:44.500]  i'm saying that the evidence appears to be very compelling
[3:09:44.500 --> 3:09:48.900]  and that the sheriffs of this country especially in
[3:09:48.900 --> 3:09:52.820]  metropolitan areas the larger cities of america
[3:09:52.820 --> 3:09:59.300]  phoenix maricopa county uh dallas uh new york city chicago
[3:09:59.300 --> 3:10:02.900]  san francisco los angeles uh all of those and other
[3:10:02.900 --> 3:10:06.820]  cities some not as big some some are quite smaller but
[3:10:06.820 --> 3:10:11.060]  it's the major metropolitan areas it's the four
[3:10:11.060 --> 3:10:16.180]  largest counties in arizona that should be conducting these
[3:10:16.180 --> 3:10:23.460]  uh and that appears on the movie this cannot be ignored
[3:10:23.460 --> 3:10:28.340]  this is the destruction if this is even a little bit true
[3:10:28.340 --> 3:10:33.860]  then this is the destruction of the constitutional american republic
[3:10:33.860 --> 3:10:37.780]  and i don't want that anymore and i don't want the fundamental change
[3:10:37.780 --> 3:10:43.380]  that biden and obama have promised us i want the fundamentals of american
[3:10:43.380 --> 3:10:48.020]  values to stay in place and i don't believe any sheriff
[3:10:48.020 --> 3:10:52.580]  can't ignore this anymore a lot of them don't want to watch the movie
[3:10:52.580 --> 3:10:57.620]  box wants to ignore this movie newsmax wants to ignore this movie
[3:10:57.620 --> 3:11:02.100]  i will not do that and i cannot do that as an american
[3:11:02.100 --> 3:11:08.020]  and as a constitutional sheriff i cannot do that so we issued a press release
[3:11:08.020 --> 3:11:12.820]  calling on all media and all citizens and all sheriffs
[3:11:12.820 --> 3:11:18.660]  to investigate the evidence as it appears on two thousand mules
[3:11:18.660 --> 3:11:24.340]  and maybe it didn't happen in your area but i bear i bet some other forms of
[3:11:24.340 --> 3:11:28.340]  uh the the vote harvesting and ballot harvesting
[3:11:28.340 --> 3:11:32.740]  and some of this fraud did happen in your areas but it's not going to be every
[3:11:32.740 --> 3:11:36.500]  single county there's 3100 counties in america
[3:11:36.500 --> 3:11:43.700]  but this needs to be addressed and sheriffs you have a moral
[3:11:43.700 --> 3:11:48.500]  and lawful obligation to verify whether or not
[3:11:48.500 --> 3:11:55.140]  the information put out in this movie is false or if it's true and then you
[3:11:55.140 --> 3:11:59.540]  have an obligation to put this before a competent prosecutor
[3:11:59.540 --> 3:12:03.940]  or before a grand jury and let's put this
[3:12:03.940 --> 3:12:09.940]  issue to rest and let's investigate one of the biggest crimes the way it
[3:12:09.940 --> 3:12:13.620]  looks the allegation is this would be one of the
[3:12:13.620 --> 3:12:18.980]  biggest crimes and frauds ever perpetrated in the history of america
[3:12:18.980 --> 3:12:23.940]  and the victim is the american people
[3:12:23.940 --> 3:12:28.340]  amen i just got chills when you were talking because i love that you are
[3:12:28.340 --> 3:12:32.660]  putting these sheriffs on high alert to say look at this you
[3:12:32.660 --> 3:12:35.700]  cannot ignore it you can't divert your attention away
[3:12:35.700 --> 3:12:39.220]  you can't just simply say it doesn't exist it's on film
[3:12:39.220 --> 3:12:43.860]  and where the mules weren't doing it the software took care of business
[3:12:43.860 --> 3:12:49.300]  so we have to have an investigation by every sheriff in this country like you
[3:12:49.300 --> 3:12:52.340]  said to rule it out or prove it but they
[3:12:52.340 --> 3:12:56.500]  should be doing something and so far they haven't been doing much
[3:12:56.500 --> 3:13:00.340]  correct no and and and i haven't either
[3:13:00.340 --> 3:13:06.900]  until now because there's real evidence and i've said it before you know if
[3:13:06.900 --> 3:13:11.060]  if any of you have evidence of voter fraud take it to your sheriff
[3:13:11.060 --> 3:13:15.460]  and ask him to do an investigation so a few sheriffs across the country have
[3:13:15.460 --> 3:13:20.020]  sheriffs mailing in wisconsin did an investigation on voter fraud
[3:13:20.020 --> 3:13:25.620]  from nursing homes because they were uh ballot harvesting with people who were
[3:13:25.620 --> 3:13:29.380]  not capable of voting and they got voted for
[3:13:29.380 --> 3:13:34.340]  and he saw the fraud he gave the information of the evidence over to the
[3:13:34.340 --> 3:13:39.460]  attorney general in wisconsin and that
[3:13:39.460 --> 3:13:44.820]  idiot uh and and i would say the most incompetent
[3:13:44.820 --> 3:13:52.100]  ag in the country told the sheriff that's a pretty nice publicity stunt
[3:13:52.100 --> 3:13:55.540]  and he and he would not look at it and he would not
[3:13:55.540 --> 3:13:59.620]  take it before a grand jury and he failed to do his job
[3:13:59.620 --> 3:14:04.420]  winningly uh but i believe there's enough sheriffs in this country
[3:14:04.420 --> 3:14:10.420]  that have access to good prosecutors to legitimate ag's
[3:14:10.420 --> 3:14:13.860]  who will see this evidence and follow up with it
[3:14:13.860 --> 3:14:21.220]  and let's okay let's let the consequences follow where they may
[3:14:21.220 --> 3:14:25.220]  and let's do our jobs as lawmen in this country
[3:14:25.220 --> 3:14:29.700]  and let's bring this thing to a close whether it's yes or no
[3:14:29.700 --> 3:14:33.460]  or thumbs up or thumbs down on the evidence let's
[3:14:33.460 --> 3:14:39.300]  put it to rest but to ignore this is malfeasance of office
[3:14:39.300 --> 3:14:45.860]  and it's almost treason you cannot ignore this evidence

[3:15:47.060 --> 3:15:55.540]  we'll be talking a little bit more about election fraud be right back
[3:15:55.540 --> 3:15:59.780]  so when i first started taking survival skills basically i was 275 pounds
[3:15:59.780 --> 3:16:02.820]  i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe
[3:16:02.820 --> 3:16:06.740]  i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i
[3:16:06.740 --> 3:16:09.620]  listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[3:16:09.620 --> 3:16:12.660]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly
[3:16:12.660 --> 3:16:15.860]  thereafter you came out with that stew you had you know with a deeper source you
[3:16:15.860 --> 3:16:19.700]  know and i got really excited about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went
[3:16:19.700 --> 3:16:23.540]  from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[3:16:23.540 --> 3:16:27.700]  enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again and
[3:16:27.700 --> 3:16:31.540]  over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i
[3:16:31.540 --> 3:16:34.660]  religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all
[3:16:34.660 --> 3:16:38.340]  absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it'll
[3:16:38.340 --> 3:16:41.780]  literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but
[3:16:41.780 --> 3:16:45.620]  anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of
[3:16:45.620 --> 3:16:49.460]  the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into
[3:16:49.460 --> 3:16:52.260]  our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so

[3:20:34.100 --> 3:20:37.220]  wonderful sheriffs out there but they really need to spread the word in
[3:20:37.220 --> 3:20:41.300]  looking into this fraud because we really need them to stand up and do their
[3:20:41.300 --> 3:20:44.660]  job um joining me right now are two gals from the
[3:20:44.660 --> 3:20:48.980]  state of utah who have been going after the file requests for the information
[3:20:48.980 --> 3:20:53.460]  on election fraud like no other and later in this broadcast i'll get into the
[3:20:53.460 --> 3:20:56.660]  timeline of the events in the news as far as the
[3:20:56.660 --> 3:21:00.500]  texas event but for right now i'd really like to invite
[3:21:00.500 --> 3:21:04.900]  sophie and jen on the these gals are called two red pills for a reason
[3:21:04.900 --> 3:21:08.900]  and they've been doing some wonderful work in the state of utah to get through
[3:21:08.900 --> 3:21:12.740]  to the election fraud there's such a massive amount of it
[3:21:12.740 --> 3:21:16.420]  it's been difficult to get these um to get these fire requests
[3:21:16.420 --> 3:21:21.620]  and so when we talk about citizens jumping into this and doing something
[3:21:21.620 --> 3:21:24.980]  about it my hat my biggest hat tip to these two ladies
[3:21:24.980 --> 3:21:28.500]  for these two moms if you will for doing something
[3:21:28.500 --> 3:21:32.580]  about it and i mean spending a lot of time doing this welcome to the program
[3:21:32.580 --> 3:21:35.780]  sophie and jen how are you
[3:21:35.940 --> 3:21:41.460]  we're great thanks for having us kate absolutely tell us a little bit about
[3:21:41.460 --> 3:21:44.580]  how you guys got rolling on this because i want every
[3:21:44.580 --> 3:21:48.020]  average person in america to understand that they can
[3:21:48.020 --> 3:21:52.420]  absolutely do something you have made quite the waves in the state of utah
[3:21:52.420 --> 3:21:55.300]  and across the country in teaching other people how to do this
[3:21:55.300 --> 3:21:57.940]  how did it start
[3:21:59.540 --> 3:22:03.540]  well it started kind of with the mask mandate we were not willing to let our
[3:22:03.540 --> 3:22:07.460]  children be the subjects of tyrannical rule
[3:22:07.460 --> 3:22:11.460]  and a violation of their rights so we were able to overturn the salt lake county
[3:22:11.460 --> 3:22:18.020]  mandate for for utah and that was huge because it actually
[3:22:18.020 --> 3:22:23.220]  made our governor be threatened with lawsuits and losing money
[3:22:23.220 --> 3:22:26.660]  millions and millions of dollars because he had pre signed an agreement
[3:22:26.660 --> 3:22:29.780]  through 2023 with our state board of education
[3:22:29.780 --> 3:22:34.020]  that he would keep our kids in masks as we did this we started uncovering a lot
[3:22:34.020 --> 3:22:38.260]  of information on education and at the same time we started uncovering a lot
[3:22:38.260 --> 3:22:41.460]  of information about elections and we
[3:22:41.460 --> 3:22:45.380]  we were like this is the problem we're not seeing a lot of results here we see
[3:22:45.380 --> 3:22:48.740]  a lot of people concerned but we're going to take this into our own hands
[3:22:48.740 --> 3:22:53.300]  just to make sure it's getting exposed and preserved
[3:22:53.300 --> 3:22:58.100]  for the election down amazing and then what happened you started
[3:22:58.100 --> 3:23:01.460]  putting in requests and they started blocking these requests even to the
[3:23:01.460 --> 3:23:05.860]  tune of charging you a hundred thousand dollars for a request that was very
[3:23:05.860 --> 3:23:09.540]  simple and that was the information passed amongst
[3:23:09.540 --> 3:23:14.580]  themselves and the records that are public there are records and you guys
[3:23:14.580 --> 3:23:18.420]  went after this and then what happened
[3:23:18.900 --> 3:23:22.180]  yeah well it was interesting because she charged me almost a hundred thousand
[3:23:22.180 --> 3:23:26.340]  dollars from our county clerk asking for just a couple thousand emails about the
[3:23:26.340 --> 3:23:29.540]  machines themselves we have since learned through
[3:23:29.540 --> 3:23:33.140]  other public records that Sophie got and they're amazing
[3:23:33.140 --> 3:23:37.140]  that these machines that they're trying to cover up were actually not certified
[3:23:37.140 --> 3:23:40.500]  by the EAC so we can understand their motive
[3:23:40.500 --> 3:23:44.100]  on why they're trying to hide this but yeah I mean they tried to charge a
[3:23:44.100 --> 3:23:47.060]  hundred thousand dollars it was illegal rates I
[3:23:47.060 --> 3:23:50.820]  proved it was illegal rates they had them drop the rates and ended up
[3:23:50.820 --> 3:23:53.860]  getting a hearing at the state records office that gave me the
[3:23:53.860 --> 3:23:57.860]  information for free because of the broadcast we do their
[3:23:57.860 --> 3:24:02.580]  reaction to that was to turn around and sue me the county sued me along with
[3:24:02.580 --> 3:24:07.300]  the state records committee to prevent us from getting that information out
[3:24:07.300 --> 3:24:11.540]  absolutely and then what happened was you got a software engineer involved
[3:24:11.540 --> 3:24:14.980]  he started looking at the public records that were already made public
[3:24:14.980 --> 3:24:19.860]  and noticed 250 thousand ballots here were you know over here in this section
[3:24:19.860 --> 3:24:24.660]  were switched from in person to absentee and then all the sudden when people go
[3:24:24.660 --> 3:24:28.020]  straight party ticket things weren't lining up they were voting for the
[3:24:28.020 --> 3:24:31.780]  governor but not for Trump and then all of the sudden which is kind of rare
[3:24:31.780 --> 3:24:34.900]  and then all the sudden within 24 hours after the election the
[3:24:34.900 --> 3:24:38.900]  machines were sent down to of all places Maricopa County
[3:24:38.900 --> 3:24:43.940]  which had obviously and allegedly some some major fraud going on
[3:24:43.940 --> 3:24:47.220]  and so the machines were sent down there when we were supposed to keep them in
[3:24:47.220 --> 3:24:49.860]  possession for months and as I'm saying this I'm
[3:24:49.860 --> 3:24:52.980]  wondering how many states have also had this happen
[3:24:52.980 --> 3:24:56.900]  you guys were looking into it for particular state how many states have
[3:24:56.900 --> 3:25:00.340]  the same issue going on
[3:25:01.380 --> 3:25:06.100]  oh Kate as we're looking at our public records it is astonishing to see how
[3:25:06.100 --> 3:25:11.780]  this was a nationwide hit job on our elections
[3:25:11.780 --> 3:25:15.780]  we've got some public records for Georgia that shows
[3:25:15.780 --> 3:25:21.460]  that numerous times during the the week of the November 3rd 2020 elections
[3:25:21.460 --> 3:25:25.140]  that different people or users tried to log
[3:25:25.140 --> 3:25:30.420]  into the election systems for different counties in Georgia
[3:25:30.420 --> 3:25:34.900]  and they were not allowed in but there was alerts given out to the county
[3:25:34.900 --> 3:25:38.100]  clerks that these people that were not verified
[3:25:38.100 --> 3:25:42.020]  and were not supposed to be logging into their election systems
[3:25:42.020 --> 3:25:45.940]  were doing this and we have many many accounts of this happening
[3:25:45.940 --> 3:25:50.260]  all through starting November 3rd and going in a couple of days
[3:25:50.260 --> 3:25:53.220]  so that's that's pretty frightening to think
[3:25:53.220 --> 3:25:56.980]  people are logging in and we have evidence
[3:25:56.980 --> 3:26:02.020]  of it and even here in Utah in just in Salt Lake County we've been told
[3:26:02.020 --> 3:26:07.700]  that well over 200 out of the 277 passwords in our machines
[3:26:07.700 --> 3:26:12.660]  are compromised that's a that's a huge percentage it's unacceptable
[3:26:12.660 --> 3:26:15.860]  absolutely I mean it's it's overwhelming how much
[3:26:15.860 --> 3:26:19.140]  evidence there actually is and you really can't ignore it like Sheriff
[3:26:19.140 --> 3:26:23.460]  Mack said if if sheriffs can ignore this something is wrong with the sheriffs
[3:26:23.460 --> 3:26:26.340]  in America and they're putting their heads in the sand and they are not
[3:26:26.340 --> 3:26:30.580]  standing by the oath they took in fact I noticed huge amounts of just as
[3:26:30.580 --> 3:26:36.020]  soon as you guys started poking around a huge amount of op-eds written by the
[3:26:36.020 --> 3:26:39.460]  governor himself saying oh the elections are perfect don't look here
[3:26:39.460 --> 3:26:42.740]  and even going as far as to say you're un-American
[3:26:42.740 --> 3:26:46.740]  if you you try to examine any of this information
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:49.620]  I could not believe I'm sorry but that is so
[3:26:49.620 --> 3:26:53.860]  egregious I could not believe they were actually saying this
[3:26:53.860 --> 3:26:57.620]  to the to the state to the to the people in the state
[3:26:57.620 --> 3:27:00.980]  how many other states if they went people went poking around
[3:27:00.980 --> 3:27:04.340]  would other governors say the same thing don't you dare look here that's
[3:27:04.340 --> 3:27:11.300]  un-American if you try to look for fraud which is readily available right
[3:27:12.100 --> 3:27:15.380]  right and Kate what's interesting is when Sophie and I started doing our
[3:27:15.380 --> 3:27:19.060]  request in December to to get the election data
[3:27:19.060 --> 3:27:22.740]  we wanted to tie it up in court so that they couldn't destroy it at the 22
[3:27:22.740 --> 3:27:25.140]  month window we knew they wouldn't give it to us even
[3:27:25.140 --> 3:27:28.980]  though they should and had in the past but we were met
[3:27:28.980 --> 3:27:32.980]  immediately within an hour after one of my request I had the lieutenant governor
[3:27:32.980 --> 3:27:36.420]  giving my private information to a reporter to do a hit piece on me
[3:27:36.420 --> 3:27:40.100]  I had men in suits in my door stepped the next day I had vehicles watching my
[3:27:40.100 --> 3:27:43.620]  home since then we've been followed and
[3:27:43.620 --> 3:27:47.460]  tracked and surveilled and I mean I got a tracker on my car my computer has been
[3:27:47.460 --> 3:27:50.340]  hacked and these people are for real we have a governor here
[3:27:50.340 --> 3:27:53.780]  governor Cox who threatened the legislators that if
[3:27:53.780 --> 3:27:57.300]  behind closed doors that if they even said the word election integrity or
[3:27:57.300 --> 3:27:59.940]  looked into it at all he would rule
[3:27:59.940 --> 3:28:04.100]  careers he's also made public statements against us as citizens
[3:28:04.100 --> 3:28:09.140]  saying that the election you see terrorists are playing a very dangerous
[3:28:09.140 --> 3:28:12.340]  game and that's a quote so we have a governor making these threats to us
[3:28:12.340 --> 3:28:16.020]  directly we have evidence that Sophie and I both have evidence that they are
[3:28:16.020 --> 3:28:20.180]  acting upon those threats we have the lieutenant governor who is admitted
[3:28:20.180 --> 3:28:24.660]  to the newspapers that she sends the FBI after people who are canvassing
[3:28:24.660 --> 3:28:27.540]  and we have our director a former director of elections
[3:28:27.540 --> 3:28:31.620]  who has also sent people to the Department of Homeland Security and FBI
[3:28:31.620 --> 3:28:35.460]  and public safety I mean we have a very real thing going on here to hide this
[3:28:35.460 --> 3:28:38.580]  information we're going to come right back with two
[3:28:38.580 --> 3:28:42.740]  red pills from Utah they are actually getting the other states involved other

[3:33:18.020 --> 3:33:20.180]  bills uh that's what they call themselves from
[3:33:20.180 --> 3:33:24.660]  utah and let me just tell you they are helping other states across the nation
[3:33:24.660 --> 3:33:27.460]  this is why i wanted to invite them on the show they're doing a heck of a job
[3:33:27.460 --> 3:33:31.380]  they're two moms this means two moms can do this
[3:33:31.380 --> 3:33:35.700]  two citizens can do this and they can when they when you get involved it's
[3:33:35.700 --> 3:33:39.220]  interesting how you want to keep going because in this case there was so much
[3:33:39.220 --> 3:33:42.980]  fraud there was so much fraud and so many strange
[3:33:42.980 --> 3:33:47.300]  things that they were finding out and i also wanted to direct everybody's
[3:33:47.300 --> 3:33:51.540]  attention to truethevote.org i just interviewed katherine and
[3:33:51.540 --> 3:33:55.860]  she is just phenomenal she's done a great job in talking about cell phone
[3:33:55.860 --> 3:34:00.420]  surveillance and being able to well it's in the movie 2000 mules
[3:34:00.420 --> 3:34:03.700]  everybody needs to see this movie so they can see the election fraud for
[3:34:03.700 --> 3:34:06.260]  themselves and we're not even talking the major
[3:34:06.260 --> 3:34:10.660]  software portion um and the major software portion is one of the biggest
[3:34:10.660 --> 3:34:14.980]  portions of this too we have huge huge problems in dominion
[3:34:14.980 --> 3:34:19.140]  allegedly so um so go to truethevote.org
[3:34:19.140 --> 3:34:22.500]  truethevote.org and um and be a part of
[3:34:22.500 --> 3:34:26.740]  requesting that your sheriff look into this ladies um other things that you
[3:34:26.740 --> 3:34:30.420]  found that were really really alarming
[3:34:30.980 --> 3:34:34.420]  yeah i'm glad you brought up 2000 mules because uh
[3:34:34.420 --> 3:34:37.700]  sophie and i with representative phil liman rented out the theater for the
[3:34:37.700 --> 3:34:40.820]  world premiere of that and we absolutely love that
[3:34:40.820 --> 3:34:44.260]  that movie and and the data that they were coming up with
[3:34:44.260 --> 3:34:47.300]  one of the things that we thought was very interesting
[3:34:47.300 --> 3:34:51.620]  is that the nonprofits that they're talking about in that movie
[3:34:51.620 --> 3:34:57.300]  are paid directly or can be paid directly by the zuckerbucks
[3:34:57.300 --> 3:35:02.180]  that's the 420 million dollars that it's being funneled
[3:35:02.180 --> 3:35:07.220]  through two organizations called ctcl the center for technology and civic
[3:35:07.220 --> 3:35:12.020]  life and ceir which is the david beckham group ctcl
[3:35:12.020 --> 3:35:16.260]  david becker i'm sorry ctcl is tiana
[3:35:16.260 --> 3:35:20.500]  epps johnson and so i find it very interesting that
[3:35:20.500 --> 3:35:24.180]  millions hundreds of millions of dollars is being funneled
[3:35:24.180 --> 3:35:27.620]  into these states and we have the documents and the records that ask
[3:35:27.620 --> 3:35:31.780]  these states and these counties hey for all of this money which by the way
[3:35:31.780 --> 3:35:35.220]  they never ever um gave anybody less than what they
[3:35:35.220 --> 3:35:38.580]  asked for with all this money that's coming through
[3:35:38.580 --> 3:35:41.940]  do you want it sent to your county do you want it sent to your state
[3:35:41.940 --> 3:35:46.020]  or you can pick a non-profit organization and we'll send them the check
[3:35:46.020 --> 3:35:50.500]  directly and i was like wow i think that ties in so
[3:35:50.500 --> 3:35:54.500]  well with the 2000 mules and sophie has found some incredible
[3:35:54.500 --> 3:35:58.340]  information about what they're doing with this money
[3:35:58.340 --> 3:36:02.980]  yeah it is astonishing to see these documents these
[3:36:02.980 --> 3:36:06.740]  invoices these these grant applications when you start
[3:36:06.740 --> 3:36:10.580]  reading these these public records you realize that these third party
[3:36:10.580 --> 3:36:14.180]  organizations that are usually leftist organizations
[3:36:14.180 --> 3:36:18.900]  they were purchasing election equipment including
[3:36:18.900 --> 3:36:24.180]  scanners tabulators you name it they were purchasing it for different counties
[3:36:24.180 --> 3:36:27.860]  there's even a county in pennsylvania where
[3:36:27.860 --> 3:36:34.340]  the ctcl organization purchased 250 000 ballots for a county in
[3:36:34.340 --> 3:36:39.140]  pennsylvania and so you realize that we are actually
[3:36:39.140 --> 3:36:42.740]  who's running our elections these third party organizations are running our
[3:36:42.740 --> 3:36:45.380]  elections and what's maddening is they use the
[3:36:45.380 --> 3:36:50.500]  scandemic as the as the excuse to do all of these
[3:36:50.500 --> 3:36:54.900]  things in in several of the invoices there's
[3:36:54.900 --> 3:36:59.860]  there's money being put out by these third party organizations for different
[3:36:59.860 --> 3:37:02.900]  counties to recruit people and it's very
[3:37:02.900 --> 3:37:06.740]  interesting that they say we need we need all of our
[3:37:06.740 --> 3:37:10.740]  marketing information and pamphlets we need them in spanish
[3:37:10.740 --> 3:37:15.300]  we need them in spanish we need to really go after the spanish speaking
[3:37:15.300 --> 3:37:19.220]  community and so Jen and i have just been
[3:37:19.220 --> 3:37:23.220]  astonished by the things that are in these public records
[3:37:23.220 --> 3:37:27.940]  proving you know everyone everyone in our circle of influence believes there
[3:37:27.940 --> 3:37:30.180]  was fraud right i mean it's kind of we're at the
[3:37:30.180 --> 3:37:34.740]  point where it's undeniable but to be able to actually see these people
[3:37:34.740 --> 3:37:40.500]  that defrauded our elections talking to each other
[3:37:40.500 --> 3:37:44.340]  and say hey i'm going to purchase this uh ds200
[3:37:44.340 --> 3:37:48.580]  scanner tabulator for this county in pennsylvania which has a modem
[3:37:48.580 --> 3:37:53.940]  which has the yeah the that that ds scanner has the modem on it in it of
[3:37:53.940 --> 3:37:57.140]  course and was the one that was uncertified by the
[3:37:57.140 --> 3:38:00.260]  eac that they had to go actually recant the false
[3:38:00.260 --> 3:38:03.540]  advertising to all these counties across the nation
[3:38:03.540 --> 3:38:07.220]  yes and
[3:38:07.220 --> 3:38:13.700]  to just reach out to the most leftist organizations to recruit poll workers
[3:38:13.700 --> 3:38:18.340]  you know the the ctcl is like hey we got to put out the word to
[3:38:18.340 --> 3:38:24.260]  every single leftist other organization to come run our elections for us
[3:38:24.260 --> 3:38:30.580]  and um we have just been shocked by the collusion the corruption the crimes
[3:38:30.580 --> 3:38:34.660]  and the cover-up is even more disturbing than the
[3:38:34.660 --> 3:38:37.700]  than the collusion the corruption the crimes because they they
[3:38:37.700 --> 3:38:40.820]  they have proven to us that they have things to hide
[3:38:40.820 --> 3:38:44.420]  and some of the wording that we've found in these documents is really
[3:38:44.420 --> 3:38:47.620]  particularly alarming but it it makes sense with what we know
[3:38:47.620 --> 3:38:51.380]  this big plan is these grant awards are
[3:38:51.380 --> 3:38:55.140]  repeatedly are using the phrase how do we frame this
[3:38:55.140 --> 3:39:00.020]  around covet in other words this money this millions of dollars that we're
[3:39:00.020 --> 3:39:04.820]  getting how do we frame this and so when so if he just mentioned the the
[3:39:04.820 --> 3:39:07.940]  collusion and the corruption and the crimes and the cover-up
[3:39:07.940 --> 3:39:12.580]  that is just as big of a story as what actually happened is
[3:39:12.580 --> 3:39:15.540]  how it happened behind the scenes and who these players are
[3:39:15.540 --> 3:39:20.580]  and the fact that they intentionally and knowingly used covet and admit it in
[3:39:20.580 --> 3:39:25.220]  writing that this was um that the election hijacking
[3:39:25.220 --> 3:39:31.780]  was um hidden by the the covet agenda exactly and and Kate when you look at
[3:39:31.780 --> 3:39:36.740]  when you watch 2000 mules and you realize most of this was perpetrated by
[3:39:36.740 --> 3:39:41.220]  or advanced or able to happen because of the ballot boxes
[3:39:41.220 --> 3:39:45.540]  these third-party organizations such as ctcl they were so
[3:39:45.540 --> 3:39:52.260]  adamant to install as many ballot boxes and they purchased the ballot boxes
[3:39:52.260 --> 3:39:55.140]  for many of the counties that were given these grants
[3:39:55.140 --> 3:39:59.940]  um they were they were so adamant that these ballot boxes were put in
[3:39:59.940 --> 3:40:04.100]  every single place they could be put in and it was very interesting that they
[3:40:04.100 --> 3:40:07.700]  were very interested in putting these ballot boxes
[3:40:07.700 --> 3:40:15.700]  in um they would they would call them um less uh less privileged areas
[3:40:15.700 --> 3:40:20.420]  and so we see this this continual drive and motivation
[3:40:20.420 --> 3:40:24.180]  to use you know it's very sad to use people
[3:40:24.180 --> 3:40:29.140]  that are either ignorant or uneducated as to what's going on for their master
[3:40:29.140 --> 3:40:32.500]  plan of stealing the election and and we're being able to see this in these
[3:40:32.500 --> 3:40:36.100]  public records and what's amazing is
[3:40:36.100 --> 3:40:39.780]  Utah isn't even a swing state so can you imagine
[3:40:39.780 --> 3:40:43.460]  the amount of fraud in what would be considered one of the key
[3:40:43.460 --> 3:40:47.620]  states because Utah wasn't one of them but yet look at all this fraud
[3:40:47.620 --> 3:40:52.660]  that's what so amazes me is the level to which the government will go to
[3:40:52.660 --> 3:40:56.740]  to hide emails here in the state of Utah very very
[3:40:56.740 --> 3:41:00.260]  key uh finding um as far as how much fraud
[3:41:00.260 --> 3:41:04.500]  probably exists in the key states which really need to be looked at you
[3:41:04.500 --> 3:41:07.620]  mentioned Georgia there are so many states right now
[3:41:07.620 --> 3:41:11.940]  that obviously need to be looked into why aren't people looking into it seems
[3:41:11.940 --> 3:41:15.060]  like both parties are kind of keeping it down
[3:41:15.060 --> 3:41:18.900]  they don't want anyone to look here you know what i mean not they want to
[3:41:18.900 --> 3:41:22.020]  they want to divert attention away for sure maybe they don't want their own
[3:41:22.020 --> 3:41:27.460]  races looked at exactly well Kate honestly um in
[3:41:27.460 --> 3:41:32.580]  Pennsylvania our documents in our opinion Pennsylvania was the
[3:41:32.580 --> 3:41:36.340]  hardest hit by these third party leftist organizations
[3:41:36.340 --> 3:41:40.100]  what they did to Pennsylvania is unconscionable
[3:41:40.100 --> 3:41:45.540]  yeah and if Doug Mastriano wants to
[3:41:45.540 --> 3:41:48.900]  well and it's interesting that we were talking about even a state like Utah
[3:41:48.900 --> 3:41:53.060]  well you know what Utah two counties in Utah took the zucker bucks
[3:41:53.060 --> 3:41:56.820]  cash county and Utah county and so all of these states that are like hey we're
[3:41:56.820 --> 3:41:59.540]  not swing states we don't have to worry about this no you actually
[3:41:59.540 --> 3:42:02.820]  you do all of these counties across you know
[3:42:02.820 --> 3:42:06.580]  Texas I mean everywhere these conservative states are taking the money
[3:42:06.580 --> 3:42:12.740]  and they're the documents show that they have to spend it as
[3:42:12.740 --> 3:42:16.020]  as they are told to spend it or else they have to pay it back
[3:42:16.020 --> 3:42:18.980]  so these people are on are a part of this crime but they don't even know
[3:42:18.980 --> 3:42:22.180]  they're a part of it and it's really heartbreaking for these county clerks
[3:42:22.180 --> 3:42:26.340]  who think they're doing the right thing and have just been sold to Sakalize
[3:42:26.340 --> 3:42:29.620]  with this right greatest crime of our lifetime in my opinion

[3:47:26.900 --> 3:47:30.900]  health no matter what they drop on us you know um i want to talk for just a
[3:47:30.900 --> 3:47:34.660]  moment and by the way thank you to two red pills on telegram
[3:47:34.660 --> 3:47:37.700]  really appreciate all the work they're doing in their own state which means
[3:47:37.700 --> 3:47:42.020]  that you can do this work too you can be private citizens
[3:47:42.020 --> 3:47:45.540]  going after this information the fire requests from your
[3:47:45.540 --> 3:47:50.340]  offices of your lieutenant governors this is such an important step this and
[3:47:50.340 --> 3:47:53.380]  of course with sheriff mac leaning on the sheriffs
[3:47:53.380 --> 3:47:58.100]  the sheriffs have to do this and so do the county commissioners in your areas
[3:47:58.100 --> 3:48:02.020]  we have 3100 counties in america if the county commissioners
[3:48:02.020 --> 3:48:06.340]  voted in all of these counties to switch to handwritten ballots
[3:48:06.340 --> 3:48:09.460]  a hand-done ballots um we might have a chance
[3:48:09.460 --> 3:48:13.540]  we might have a chance in this country but it seems as though both parties one
[3:48:13.540 --> 3:48:16.340]  party is extremely silent and the other party
[3:48:16.340 --> 3:48:20.100]  is actively destroying the country um with their fraud
[3:48:20.100 --> 3:48:23.700]  the other party that's supposed to be defending all of us not a word
[3:48:23.700 --> 3:48:28.180]  just crickets yep crickets all we hear so
[3:48:28.180 --> 3:48:31.300]  something has to be done you know i'm sure they're counting their money and
[3:48:31.300 --> 3:48:34.420]  they're really excited about making a ton of money from pharma and everything
[3:48:34.420 --> 3:48:37.140]  else and throughout the last couple of years it's been
[3:48:37.140 --> 3:48:40.660]  probably pretty amazing for all of these congress people
[3:48:40.660 --> 3:48:44.580]  and senators but they really do need to maybe i don't know say a peep
[3:48:44.580 --> 3:48:48.500]  about election fraud that would be refreshing wouldn't it so
[3:48:48.500 --> 3:48:52.020]  i'm having a little trouble with the timeline and i wondered if you all could
[3:48:52.020 --> 3:48:57.380]  help me a little bit with this and of course you can email me kate at katedallyradio.com
[3:48:57.380 --> 3:49:01.300]  i was trying to construct a timeline and i found it rather difficult and let me
[3:49:01.300 --> 3:49:06.260]  tell you why of the shooting because i know that everybody in america is
[3:49:06.260 --> 3:49:11.140]  obviously you know they're saddened and it's horrific and we're looking at the
[3:49:11.140 --> 3:49:15.860]  news and the whole nation all the mass media seems to be
[3:49:15.860 --> 3:49:20.420]  turned toward this event i understand that so let's construct a little timeline
[3:49:20.420 --> 3:49:23.700]  can we do that because i'm having a little trouble doing it let me share with you
[3:49:23.700 --> 3:49:29.140]  why so at 1117 the school district of uvalda
[3:49:29.140 --> 3:49:35.380]  sent out a message that said this was at 1117 this was before the authority said
[3:49:35.380 --> 3:49:38.180]  the event took place and it said there's an active
[3:49:38.180 --> 3:49:41.620]  shooter at rob elementary law enforcement is on site
[3:49:41.620 --> 3:49:46.340]  your cooperation is needed at this time by not visiting the campus
[3:49:46.340 --> 3:49:49.780]  as soon as more information is gathered it will be shared
[3:49:49.780 --> 3:49:55.620]  and it said the rest of the district is under secure status this was at 1117
[3:49:55.620 --> 3:50:00.100]  am the problem is is that all the reports say
[3:50:00.100 --> 3:50:04.660]  the authorities say that this didn't happen until 1132
[3:50:04.660 --> 3:50:08.020]  so you have 1117 with a tweet saying that this
[3:50:08.020 --> 3:50:12.020]  shooter is out in the school shooting the school
[3:50:12.020 --> 3:50:16.020]  up and by the time they would have even written that
[3:50:16.020 --> 3:50:20.260]  the event would have occurred so that means before 1117 they weren't going to
[3:50:20.260 --> 3:50:23.380]  do it the second it happened right doesn't make sense
[3:50:23.380 --> 3:50:27.140]  but the district put out a tweet at 1117
[3:50:27.140 --> 3:50:33.060]  then the authorities came out and said everything happened at 1132
[3:50:33.060 --> 3:50:37.060]  the only problem is is that at 1143 on facebook
[3:50:37.060 --> 3:50:42.820]  and they even time stamped it 1143 they even wrote 1143
[3:50:42.820 --> 3:50:46.260]  the rob elementary came out and said oh
[3:50:46.260 --> 3:50:50.260]  that we're in a lockdown because there's some gun there were some
[3:50:50.260 --> 3:50:53.540]  possible gunfire or shots outside of the school
[3:50:53.540 --> 3:50:59.140]  in the area this was at 1143 when the event was supposed to be taking place
[3:50:59.140 --> 3:51:02.740]  and they said you know everything's fine we're all safe and secure in here we're
[3:51:02.740 --> 3:51:05.540]  all locked down in here no big deal no problem
[3:51:05.540 --> 3:51:08.980]  just so you guys know we're in a safe secure place
[3:51:08.980 --> 3:51:13.780]  and it's okay but supposedly at that point the gunman was shooting his way
[3:51:13.780 --> 3:51:19.460]  down the corridor so how could they have sent out this message at 1143
[3:51:19.460 --> 3:51:23.540]  then at noon 20 minutes after that and by the way the authority said this
[3:51:23.540 --> 3:51:27.300]  the shooting back and forth with the border patrol agents
[3:51:27.300 --> 3:51:33.300]  not really the cops which again is very strange why were border patrol there
[3:51:33.300 --> 3:51:36.900]  the border patrol agents were shooting back and forth with this guy
[3:51:36.900 --> 3:51:41.620]  for an hour and a half so in the middle of the shooting at
[3:51:41.620 --> 3:51:45.940]  around noon right the shooting had just started they said
[3:51:45.940 --> 3:51:50.820]  all of a sudden all 600 children were sent to the civic center
[3:51:50.820 --> 3:51:54.580]  but i didn't see any aerial shots or any photography of
[3:51:54.580 --> 3:51:58.660]  any students really leaving the building in masses
[3:51:58.660 --> 3:52:02.580]  there were no buses to pick the kids up there was no how do you leave in the
[3:52:02.580 --> 3:52:07.540]  middle of gunfire not quite sure so i'd really appreciate all of your
[3:52:07.540 --> 3:52:11.940]  help in trying to figure out what what how this went down
[3:52:11.940 --> 3:52:15.940]  we all want to grieve for these families and we all want to understand
[3:52:15.940 --> 3:52:18.980]  what happened of course and the correct timeline
[3:52:18.980 --> 3:52:23.140]  it just seems really difficult to get that timeline
[3:52:23.140 --> 3:52:29.940]  so at 144 um they were obviously telling the parents you know it's
[3:52:29.940 --> 3:52:33.060]  about time you can come pick up your kids from the civic center
[3:52:33.060 --> 3:52:37.060]  there was a big whiteboard out in front of the civic center with all the names
[3:52:37.060 --> 3:52:40.260]  of the teachers and water bottles ready to hand out
[3:52:40.260 --> 3:52:43.540]  they sure got those in place quickly so i was really glad that
[3:52:43.540 --> 3:52:48.980]  everyone attending had water um but i was also really perplexed at how
[3:52:48.980 --> 3:52:53.460]  quickly they dispersed the children i know when we had a thread of a shooting
[3:52:53.460 --> 3:52:56.980]  in my own community they kept the kids till six o'clock at night
[3:52:56.980 --> 3:53:00.980]  inside another building far away even though they had the suspect so that was
[3:53:00.980 --> 3:53:04.020]  kind of strange so they were dispersing children
[3:53:04.020 --> 3:53:07.460]  after two o'clock and they were telling parents they could come to the
[3:53:07.460 --> 3:53:11.940]  civic center well this also happened around noon
[3:53:11.940 --> 3:53:15.300]  when they let the parents know via tweet that they were
[3:53:15.300 --> 3:53:18.820]  shipping all the kids to the civic center that they were there and that they
[3:53:18.820 --> 3:53:22.340]  would be able to be picked up there right in the middle of that whole hour
[3:53:22.340 --> 3:53:26.180]  and a half shooting it's very very strange
[3:53:26.180 --> 3:53:29.780]  then of course the authority said that they had already picked up
[3:53:29.780 --> 3:53:35.460]  the and he was in custody the kid was in custody the 18 year old
[3:53:35.460 --> 3:53:39.540]  well the problem was was they also said that he died at the school in a
[3:53:39.540 --> 3:53:43.540]  shootout which was it was he in custody or was he
[3:53:43.540 --> 3:53:48.100]  i'm just trying to understand or was he um was he dead on the scene
[3:53:48.100 --> 3:53:55.380]  none of that ever really made sense also at 3 30 they let everybody know at the
[3:53:55.380 --> 3:54:00.580]  memorial hospital that most all the kids were fine they were alive
[3:54:00.580 --> 3:54:07.620]  in fact two had died but they were alive but then by half an hour later
[3:54:07.620 --> 3:54:11.460]  all of them had died that were in the hospital and i just found that to be
[3:54:11.460 --> 3:54:14.820]  really really strange i've just never seen so many
[3:54:14.820 --> 3:54:18.020]  so many people die in such a short time frame before
[3:54:18.020 --> 3:54:22.900]  so i would love to get more specifics specifics on that if you will
[3:54:22.900 --> 3:54:27.140]  um the texas department of public safety confirmed
[3:54:27.140 --> 3:54:31.700]  that a school police officer exchanged gunfire with a suspected shooter this
[3:54:31.700 --> 3:54:37.380]  came out today um who unleashed fatal gunfire at rob elementary
[3:54:37.380 --> 3:54:41.060]  but and they said that somebody was injured in that
[3:54:41.060 --> 3:54:45.140]  and that he had barricaded himself in and dropped a bag of ammunition at the
[3:54:45.140 --> 3:54:48.340]  entrance of the school the only other problem is they
[3:54:48.340 --> 3:54:51.620]  still can't tell us whether it was a rifle or a handgun
[3:54:51.620 --> 3:54:54.740]  sometimes when all the details are a little sketchy it's always kind of
[3:54:54.740 --> 3:54:57.780]  strange for me to try to put together a timeline
[3:54:57.780 --> 3:55:01.620]  so that i can talk about it on the radio well um
[3:55:01.620 --> 3:55:04.980]  this kid pictures came out where this kid was
[3:55:04.980 --> 3:55:09.140]  more or less in trans clothing and i don't see the media talking about him
[3:55:09.140 --> 3:55:12.020]  dressed as a girl but he also bought the gun right
[3:55:12.020 --> 3:55:15.380]  after his 18th birthday just coincidentally
[3:55:15.380 --> 3:55:18.580]  um and they also had a mug shot of him ready to go
[3:55:18.580 --> 3:55:23.300]  although he never had a prior record he probably would have been denied
[3:55:23.300 --> 3:55:26.580]  the gun maybe had he had a prior record but they had a gun
[3:55:26.580 --> 3:55:31.220]  they had a mug shot ready to go the assailant was also dead
[3:55:31.220 --> 3:55:35.460]  and so we'll never be able to talk to him about the motive but they did say
[3:55:35.460 --> 3:55:39.300]  that he clearly left some messages on social media
[3:55:39.300 --> 3:55:43.060]  it seems that that happens a lot the assailant is usually between the ages
[3:55:43.060 --> 3:55:46.580]  of 18 and 29 they're a loner and they put
[3:55:46.580 --> 3:55:50.660]  messages on social media right before they're going to go do something
[3:55:50.660 --> 3:55:55.220]  they hit facebook right before they embark on doing something
[3:55:55.220 --> 3:55:58.580]  also they had some testimonials of people
[3:55:58.580 --> 3:56:03.060]  who actually heard what the grandmother said as the boy shot his grandmother
[3:56:03.060 --> 3:56:06.820]  and then went to the school and they actually had details i'm not quite sure
[3:56:06.820 --> 3:56:09.380]  how they had so many details it was really strange
[3:56:09.380 --> 3:56:13.860]  so 1117 the school says an active shooter is already on going
[3:56:13.860 --> 3:56:16.980]  the authorities say it didn't happen till 1132
[3:56:16.980 --> 3:56:20.500]  and then at 1143 the elementary school says oh
[3:56:20.500 --> 3:56:24.580]  there might be some gunfire outside but of course everybody's safe in here and
[3:56:24.580 --> 3:56:28.020]  no problem right smack in the middle of the shooting
[3:56:28.020 --> 3:56:32.260]  i did find that kind of strange and i wish i had some answers
[3:56:32.260 --> 3:56:36.420]  for very very sketchy information and sketchy information
[3:56:36.420 --> 3:56:40.180]  offered up by the school district and the schools
[3:56:40.180 --> 3:56:43.940]  hmm i know that they were having problems funding the hospital and i know
[3:56:43.940 --> 3:56:48.020]  they were having some problems with um covet dollars
[3:56:48.020 --> 3:56:52.100]  uh coming into the school as well prior to this as of january
[3:56:52.100 --> 3:56:55.140]  they were getting paid a lot of money from covet dollars
[3:56:55.140 --> 3:56:58.740]  so i just wanted to bring these things up i'm still looking for any footage of
[3:56:58.740 --> 3:57:01.540]  children running from the school like we saw in columbine
[3:57:01.540 --> 3:57:04.820]  haven't found any yet i haven't found i'd like to see the footage where the
[3:57:04.820 --> 3:57:08.020]  kids were boarding the buses so that we can get a correct timeline
[3:57:08.020 --> 3:57:12.020]  that would be better in in order to put this timeline together
[3:57:12.020 --> 3:57:15.380]  but i so appreciate you listening to some of the details i found pretty
[3:57:15.380 --> 3:57:19.060]  perplexing and we'll look into more of course
[3:57:19.060 --> 3:57:23.620]  as none of this has really made sense especially the school involvement in
[3:57:23.620 --> 3:57:26.980]  giving us details so that's been really strange
[3:57:26.980 --> 3:57:31.380]  anyway i'm k dally your guest host for the ox jones show the k dally show you
[3:57:31.380 --> 3:57:35.540]  can go to kdallyradio.com and i do hope that we can find some answers
[3:57:35.540 --> 3:57:39.300]  um because it doesn't seem to be shaking out
[3:57:39.300 --> 3:57:43.380]  i mean that the details are sketchy so we hope for more details
[3:57:43.380 --> 3:57:49.780]  and we are now proud to release the redux line of fairday bags this line
