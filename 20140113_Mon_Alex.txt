[03:34.640 --> 03:40.280]  after the break we've got huge amounts of economic news look just observing
[03:40.280 --> 03:42.760]  what's happening on the ground around the country and other parts of the world
[03:42.760 --> 03:48.080]  where I've traveled and just observing what's really happening there is a mania
[03:48.080 --> 03:54.520]  hysteria out there in the air people are going crazy at record numbers suicide at
[03:54.520 --> 03:59.000]  record numbers get rich quick schemes at record numbers because we live in a
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.880]  fraudulent economy more and more now and I'm gonna just say this watch who you're
[04:04.880 --> 04:10.800]  around watch who you work with very very closely and watch your fix in life
[04:10.800 --> 04:18.920]  because there is a underlying concern in the in the group collective mind about
[04:18.920 --> 04:24.360]  the future and I've never felt so much anxiety and dread about economic
[04:24.360 --> 04:29.280]  collapse war you name it and everyone's feeling and a lot of people can't
[04:29.280 --> 04:32.480]  differentiate why they're having so much anxiety because your mind is very
[04:32.480 --> 04:35.960]  powerful even if you're dumbed down your brain still knows there's big trouble
[04:35.960 --> 04:42.480]  going on bad moon rising we need to get that as an intro bad moon rising and
[04:42.480 --> 04:49.040]  there's a bad moon rising trouble on the way and it's coming in a bunch of
[04:49.040 --> 04:54.200]  different permutations but admitting we're facing the crises as we go into a
[04:54.200 --> 04:59.320]  very decadent bottom of a cycle will help us hopefully have a soft landing

[05:04.160 --> 05:09.200]  entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model
[05:09.200 --> 05:14.320]  is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to

[08:58.960 --> 09:06.360]  anything that stands in the way of their piratical repine this is one of the
[09:06.360 --> 09:10.440]  most important periods in human history that we're entering if not the most
[09:10.440 --> 09:16.560]  important ever words cannot describe the massive changes that are happening
[09:16.560 --> 09:23.520]  economic spiritual cultural national international global galactic with all

[09:32.160 --> 09:38.720]  change undoubtedly it's here everyone can feel it the average person cannot
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.880]  differentiate it from their own personal lives and we are seeing meltdown
[09:42.880 --> 09:47.640]  levels throughout militaries worldwide governments worldwide corporations
[09:47.640 --> 09:53.320]  worldwide the everything is beginning to melt down it's all because the systems
[09:53.320 --> 09:57.660]  based on fraud now winners and losers are being picked by the globalist they
[09:57.660 --> 10:01.480]  have hundreds of trillions of dollars a year to buy up the world but it's not
[10:01.480 --> 10:06.400]  based in real manufacturing real products real ideas they've had to sell a
[10:06.400 --> 10:13.280]  culture of fraud lies mental illness and 2 plus 2 equals 5 to the world population
[10:13.280 --> 10:20.120]  to get away with all this corruption but that virus of fraud has now entered the
[10:20.120 --> 10:25.200]  system computers are malfunctioning trains are crashing and exploding more
[10:25.200 --> 10:28.400]  aircraft are going to be crashing they already are you're going to see more
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.200]  divorce you're going to see more murder you're going to see more corruption get

[10:42.800 --> 10:48.680]  get ready because it's only going to get more insane from here on out as I've
[10:48.680 --> 10:54.280]  been telling you the top story up on info wars.com in fact it should be red
[10:54.280 --> 10:59.560]  linked it's it's such a big deal there in the featured news area is China set to
[10:59.560 --> 11:09.040]  seize South China C by force now this is in the big Chinese daily newspapers Paul
[11:09.040 --> 11:13.560]  Watson's wife that works for info wars.com is Chinese that's how we're
[11:13.560 --> 11:17.160]  able to have these articles every week because this never hits the Western
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.960]  press until we usually carry it we take it translated put it out drudge
[11:21.960 --> 11:26.600]  report.com picks it up to the middle column today fifth story down and then
[11:26.600 --> 11:31.480]  only then does it even get picked up in fact most the time if we report this
[11:31.480 --> 11:34.040]  kind of stuff and drudge doesn't pick it up it doesn't even get picked up in the
[11:34.040 --> 11:38.960]  dinosaur media drudge has to pick it up to force them to cover it but the
[11:38.960 --> 11:44.120]  Chinese troops to seize the islands back from Philippines and that is in the
[11:44.120 --> 11:48.360]  Chinese approved government publication I mean government affiliated
[11:48.360 --> 11:56.800]  publication I mean that is whoa whoa that is a big deal and you've got US ships
[11:56.800 --> 12:01.040]  massing in the area in the last year I mean this is a serious confrontation this
[12:01.040 --> 12:08.400]  is a big deal World War two as you know started for the United States when the
[12:08.400 --> 12:13.320]  Japanese began to go into the Philippines and other areas as well this has
[12:13.320 --> 12:17.120]  happened before I mean I'm telling you folks this is how World War three starts
[12:17.120 --> 12:22.440]  when you've got giant global bubbles of fraud and the Anglo-American banksters
[12:22.440 --> 12:27.120]  sitting on top of that they will always push countries into war and they've
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.760]  built up China they're pulling the strings there they've built up the EU I
[12:31.760 --> 12:36.000]  mean and again they're playing all of us off against each other you got to pull
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.520]  back and see how this hyper evil intelligence of the banksters that's
[12:40.520 --> 12:44.920]  why they almost have world government in place right now and if they've got to
[12:44.920 --> 12:47.080]  have a world war and kill a hundred million two hundred million people to do
[12:47.080 --> 12:53.920]  it they'll do it they'll do whatever they have to to bring in their total
[12:53.920 --> 12:57.600]  control that's what they crave that's what they're going after that's their
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.360]  goal and the globalists and many of their publications say that they will
[13:02.360 --> 13:05.320]  either have world governance and total control and they will merge with the
[13:05.320 --> 13:11.160]  machines and become gods or they will destroy the planet trying that is the
[13:11.160 --> 13:16.320]  ultra hyper wildness of these people I mean you think the Wolf of Wall Street
[13:16.320 --> 13:21.080]  throwing naked midgets at giant targets is radical and crazy and wild that's
[13:21.080 --> 13:29.480]  nothing but that's a window for people into the power-tripping maniacalness of
[13:29.480 --> 13:33.360]  the elite how they get themselves into these modes of being willing to do
[13:33.360 --> 13:38.880]  anything and to be totally crazed while telling you to be milk toast sit in your
[13:38.880 --> 13:42.440]  chair watch TV all day they're not doing that they're starting wars they're
[13:42.440 --> 13:47.080]  running black ops they got 15 mistresses they're killing people on the
[13:47.080 --> 13:51.720]  side for fun at murder parties they're molesting children it you know depends
[13:51.720 --> 13:56.120]  what group they're into there's different guilds of evil different different
[13:56.120 --> 14:01.240]  armies of evil different brigades of evil that then fit in like china dolls or
[14:01.240 --> 14:08.280]  Russian dolls nesting together into the pyramid of Lucifer and it is the total
[14:08.280 --> 14:12.000]  weapons system that they have and they're now deploying it with their
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.440]  legions of doom against us I mean this is real look at every ruling culture look
[14:19.440 --> 14:25.920]  at every dominant corrupt empire at the end they were always running around
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.880]  engaged in human sacrifice hanging children from meat hooks bathing in
[14:29.880 --> 14:36.960]  blood I mean if you see a movie like Dune and you see Baron Harkinen go up you
[14:36.960 --> 14:40.200]  know with a suspensor belts into the ceiling and have rotten blood dumped
[14:40.200 --> 14:44.840]  on him and then he goes over and pulls a heart plug out of a man that he's
[14:44.840 --> 14:49.520]  about to have necrophilic sex with after he's dead people think man how did
[14:49.520 --> 14:54.440]  how did that director because they changed the book come up with that I've
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.720]  interviewed the director and talked to him off air as well well they got all
[14:58.720 --> 15:02.640]  that from history that's the type of stuff that the elites really do ladies
[15:02.640 --> 15:09.320]  and gentlemen that's that's how a corrupt elitist actually acts and so you
[15:09.320 --> 15:15.360]  need to understand that I mean what did Jimmy Savelle people said a decade ago
[15:15.360 --> 15:18.720]  he was into dead bodies and raping little children and bringing him to
[15:18.720 --> 15:22.280]  prime ministers to have their throat slit and I heard that and was like telling
[15:22.280 --> 15:25.120]  people the wrongest guest hey don't say anymore that on the air you don't have
[15:25.120 --> 15:30.440]  proof I don't want to get sued and then later most of it came out and now they've
[15:30.440 --> 15:36.120]  killed people to cover it up in England I mean they killed children folks and
[15:36.120 --> 15:42.360]  have sex with their dead bodies okay he ran the major children's charity and you
[15:42.360 --> 15:46.880]  could take one look at Savelle and he looked like the archetypal pedophile and
[15:46.880 --> 15:50.600]  I'm not trying to scare you here folks you need to understand when good people
[15:50.600 --> 15:58.800]  stand down and do nothing the most evil takeover it's automatic it's absolutely
[15:58.800 --> 16:02.880]  automatic if you want to spread out your picnic blanket on a bed of fire ants
[16:02.880 --> 16:06.160]  that you hadn't gotten rid of what's gonna happen when you spread out your
[16:06.160 --> 16:09.520]  picnic blanket and pull your food out the fire ants are going to crawl up on
[16:09.520 --> 16:12.320]  the picnic blanket they're going to start eating the food and they're gonna
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.480]  start stinging you saying my food you let tyrants take over they're gonna come
[16:16.480 --> 16:20.520]  on the picnic blanket they're gonna eat the food and they're going to attack you
[16:20.520 --> 16:24.840]  because you're the enemy so they're not just gonna rob everything they're going
[16:24.840 --> 16:31.120]  to exterminate good people they're going to hunt us down you see you can't just
[16:31.120 --> 16:34.080]  give them the world and be lazy and think oh they'll just go off and feed on
[16:34.080 --> 16:37.680]  the week they're done they've already fed on the week they want to bring down
[16:37.680 --> 16:41.560]  the big game they want to come after other elites that aren't degenerate
[16:41.560 --> 16:44.760]  that's their number one goal they cannot stand the other elites they're
[16:44.760 --> 16:51.160]  surveilling that are not degenerate and they fear them they fear that ladies and
[16:51.160 --> 16:57.120]  gentlemen and I'm telling you they're coming they're coming drums drums drums
[16:57.120 --> 17:04.800]  in the deep and now they're here and I've got so much news I've already gone
[17:04.800 --> 17:09.120]  off on a jag on this point point is info wars comm neocons call for US
[17:09.120 --> 17:15.200]  military against al Qaeda in Iraq the very al Qaeda that is openly funded by
[17:15.200 --> 17:21.080]  our government and I love Kurtz article it's excellent but I think the sub headline
[17:21.080 --> 17:25.160]  should be neocons call for US military action against al Qaeda in Iraq sub

[17:42.200 --> 17:45.320]  have time to go in there as an editor with the m4's editor and talk to him
[17:45.320 --> 17:47.560]  about that headline where we're just working on better headlines that
[17:47.560 --> 17:50.960]  actually telegraph what the essence of what's going on the incredible

[17:54.520 --> 17:59.400]  very al Qaeda they've been arming and in bases in western Iraq to attack Syria
[17:59.400 --> 18:04.640]  have now taken over Fallujah and now it's an excuse for the US to go back in
[18:04.640 --> 18:08.720]  again see how this works and continue to destabilize Iraq because the Iraqi
[18:08.720 --> 18:12.200]  government kind of kicked the globalist out and is trying to actually bring

[18:24.080 --> 18:27.040]  rockets at their helicopters and attacking their bases and I'm not
[18:27.040 --> 18:30.680]  defending the Egyptian military but you know they didn't want martial law there
[18:30.680 --> 18:35.160]  they want prosperity but they're having to fight off Western al Qaeda who attack
[18:35.160 --> 18:39.360]  them and our media seeing in says they're the bad guys for fighting al Qaeda
[18:39.360 --> 18:43.600]  well it's the same thing they've got al Qaeda as agents of chaos if you want to
[18:43.600 --> 18:46.760]  keep Syria broken in multiple pieces Iraq broken in multiple pieces you

[33:14.720 --> 33:26.000]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.200]  again i'm not trying to scare people laying out
[33:29.200 --> 33:33.200]  what we're really facing you need to know the real threat you need to
[33:33.200 --> 33:37.200]  understand the real threat if we as a society have
[33:37.200 --> 33:43.040]  any hope any hope encountering this because that's
[33:43.040 --> 33:47.120]  the leg up that evil always has is that good people
[33:47.120 --> 33:50.960]  just cannot imagine that they're actually facing something this bad
[33:50.960 --> 33:57.120]  and by the way that's 101 of criminology 101 of kidnappers 101 of con artists
[33:57.120 --> 34:01.920]  101 of all different types of criminal activity
[34:01.920 --> 34:07.520]  is that the public cannot believe that they're actually being abused
[34:07.520 --> 34:10.560]  now the government can teach you to fear your neighbor cleaning their gun in
[34:10.560 --> 34:13.280]  their garage and you call the cops and they come and arrest them even though
[34:13.280 --> 34:16.720]  the guns are legal they can teach the public that if
[34:16.720 --> 34:20.480]  you see a parent spank their child it's illegal
[34:20.480 --> 34:25.440]  the cops come cps comes they say we believe you must be doing other abuse
[34:25.440 --> 34:29.760]  even though the spanking isn't illegal we're going to take your child
[34:29.760 --> 34:33.360]  so again they can create the perception when things aren't an issue that it's
[34:33.360 --> 34:40.240]  illegal and even convince juries and sends you to jail
[34:40.240 --> 34:44.400]  but then when there's real mass organized crime with the federal reserve
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.160]  with foreign corporations controlling the government
[34:48.160 --> 34:50.960]  you get to the point where people just think well that's the government they're
[34:50.960 --> 34:53.360]  allowed to do that and once you get to the point where they're
[34:53.360 --> 34:56.160]  dictatorial you can get away with anything katie bar the door we're going
[34:56.160 --> 34:59.520]  to be talking about that after i cover some of this energy news

[37:47.840 --> 37:53.600]  number out for first time callers today who are
[37:53.600 --> 37:57.680]  in radiology or who work at nuclear power plants or who have worked at nuclear
[37:57.680 --> 38:00.880]  power plants because i'm going to cover some other news we're going to take a
[38:00.880 --> 38:04.240]  raft of calls at the start of the next hour on this but you can line up now
[38:04.240 --> 38:08.720]  who may even go to the next segment but i specifically want to hear from
[38:08.720 --> 38:12.960]  radiologists nuclear physicists plant workers decontamination
[38:12.960 --> 38:17.600]  specialists i've interviewed physicists scientists you've heard them
[38:17.600 --> 38:21.120]  but i want to get your perspective on some areas of the west coast having
[38:21.120 --> 38:24.800]  1400 percent higher increases in the
[38:24.800 --> 38:30.400]  of normal background radiation 1400 percent then what's supposed to be normal
[38:30.400 --> 38:35.040]  other areas a hundred uh you have a hundred
[38:35.040 --> 38:39.600]  millirads so that's only triple what it's supposed to be roughly
[38:39.600 --> 38:42.880]  the point is it's going up the radiation wave is intensifying coming in from
[38:42.880 --> 38:47.440]  Fukushima that's major university studies i want to get your take on this
[38:47.440 --> 38:51.040]  do you really think this is a big deal or or what would you do
[38:51.040 --> 38:53.840]  if you were on these areas of the west coast bottom line all the local health
[38:53.840 --> 38:56.480]  departments should be out there with geiger counters
[38:56.480 --> 38:59.760]  and then giving people the numbers and then at least giving them the option
[38:59.760 --> 39:04.400]  to move back from the beach the good news is areas like santa cruz
[39:04.400 --> 39:07.920]  we're on the radio don't have any higher levels of radiation
[39:07.920 --> 39:11.440]  uh but then you go up the coaster monorail bay has a little bit of an
[39:11.440 --> 39:17.360]  increase the redwoods have a doubling if you're around san francisco it's 1400
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.800]  percent higher i mean this should be a real debate we
[39:20.800 --> 39:25.200]  should force this into dinosaur media which we've done on
[39:25.200 --> 39:28.880]  the newspapers and a lot of talk radio that's not really dinosaur media i mean
[39:28.880 --> 39:32.560]  it's super dinosaur but it's like alligators that live into the future
[39:32.560 --> 39:38.720]  that's the analogy of uh of uh talk radio it's the original alternative media
[39:38.720 --> 39:42.320]  it's the original wide open what people really think without a script
[39:42.320 --> 39:46.080]  crossing the lines of race religion political persuasion to have a real
[39:46.080 --> 39:49.040]  discussion and so i know a lot of talk show hosts have been
[39:49.040 --> 39:52.880]  covering it doing their own positive reports and by positive i mean
[39:52.880 --> 39:56.720]  saying it's positive for us to go out with geiger counters and try to cause a
[39:56.720 --> 40:02.880]  debate that a debate is always good so 800-259-9231
[40:02.880 --> 40:10.400]  800-259-9231 where is the government
[40:10.400 --> 40:16.560]  telling people that they should be taking iodine to protect the
[40:16.560 --> 40:19.200]  thyroid of their body where is the government telling people about
[40:19.200 --> 40:22.720]  these increased levels in the dangers they're not
[40:22.720 --> 40:26.960]  so it's our job to do it if other people won't do it
[40:26.960 --> 40:30.000]  but just 25 30 years ago this would be big news
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.720]  and you would see a major debate about it not that our media was even perfect
[40:34.720 --> 40:37.120]  then but it was less controlled it was more diverse there were
[40:37.120 --> 40:40.560]  hundreds of companies providing large national coverage
[40:40.560 --> 40:46.800]  in newspapers radio TV now you don't have that so it's up to us in the new
[40:46.800 --> 40:49.600]  media the real media to challenge the corporate
[40:49.600 --> 40:52.880]  state-run media and we're doing that and we are becoming the new dominant media
[40:52.880 --> 40:56.480]  these people are extincting themselves the mainstream media is committing
[40:56.480 --> 40:58.960]  suicide
[40:59.200 --> 41:04.320]  and the political system is committing suicide as well let me
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.440]  take you to this article just to illustrate this is the financial times
[41:09.440 --> 41:12.080]  of London and you've probably heard me say this
[41:12.080 --> 41:16.000]  5 000 times in the last few years but here it is in
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.560]  the establishment publication
[41:21.840 --> 41:28.640]  the tide is rising for america's libertarians the new spirit is rising
[41:28.640 --> 41:32.880]  climate of anti-politics has become an attitude rather than a movement and
[41:32.880 --> 41:37.280]  that is so dead on with what edward loose just said there
[41:37.280 --> 41:41.280]  it's an attitude we've already won the hearts and minds
[41:41.280 --> 41:45.360]  the people at the pentagon don't want to sell america out even high level
[41:45.360 --> 41:50.080]  it's suicide even if you're somewhat corrupt and a lot of them are you don't
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.520]  want to destroy the country you don't want to destroy where you live the tree
[41:53.520 --> 41:56.560]  you're sitting in and now that it's gotten so bad people in the
[41:56.560 --> 42:00.160]  corporate structure governmental structure pentagon structure
[42:00.160 --> 42:03.920]  our religious structure now starting to go man do we really want to gut america
[42:03.920 --> 42:07.920]  for world government and get screwed in the process ourselves i mean
[42:07.920 --> 42:12.080]  they're now down to bite the bullet time it's now down to
[42:12.080 --> 42:15.680]  really kill in america and when they've only gotten sick and
[42:15.680 --> 42:20.160]  debilitated in a position chained down right now to do the dirty work
[42:20.160 --> 42:23.920]  and it's going to be they're going to take their time carving us up
[42:23.920 --> 42:27.760]  we're talking blow torches we're talking
[42:27.760 --> 42:31.520]  pliers societally i mean the globalist that's the goal
[42:31.520 --> 42:35.040]  is gutting us that's what they want that's not
[42:35.040 --> 42:40.400]  in the way of their goal the goal is rampant death and insanity french
[42:40.400 --> 42:45.760]  revolution garbage this is a jacobin operation 110
[42:45.760 --> 42:48.160]  percent you want to say what the new order is
[42:48.160 --> 42:51.680]  it is the jacobin society or you know them as the
[42:51.680 --> 42:56.560]  illuminate a real group who took a fake revolution
[42:56.560 --> 42:59.840]  against tyranny it was already there the monarchy and brought in something 25
[42:59.840 --> 43:02.400]  times worse
[43:03.440 --> 43:06.720]  our revolution did not go the same direction and george washington fought
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.920]  the illuminate even though he had been a proto member of it
[43:11.920 --> 43:16.880]  yes george washington the evidence is overwhelming was offered
[43:16.880 --> 43:21.120]  the command of the illuminati and that's why the king of england called him the
[43:21.120 --> 43:24.560]  greatest man alive in the world after he defeated the
[43:24.560 --> 43:28.320]  british was offered kingship and said no was offered the
[43:28.320 --> 43:31.840]  head of the illuminati which at one level was trying to overthrow
[43:31.840 --> 43:35.760]  the british empire not to get rid of it but to take control of it
[43:35.760 --> 43:39.040]  by a luciferian group and george washington said i stand against the
[43:39.040 --> 43:43.280]  monarchy and i stand against the illuminati i mean what an incredible
[43:43.280 --> 43:48.880]  individual i mean that is amazing that's why i like george washington
[43:48.880 --> 43:54.480]  and nobody will tell you this stuff nobody will tell you the real secrets
[43:54.480 --> 43:57.600]  because they're not even secrets they're there in the historical record
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.680]  and the king of england just could not believe the incredible goodness of this
[44:01.680 --> 44:05.520]  and even though he was inbred german transylvanian royalty and had all these
[44:05.520 --> 44:11.680]  issues he literally became a worshipper of george washington at that point
[44:11.680 --> 44:15.600]  and how could you not admire something like that offered
[44:15.600 --> 44:23.520]  offered kingship over north america turns it down offered kingship worldwide
[44:23.520 --> 44:30.080]  of a movement to create a new illuminati royalty elite turns it down
[44:30.080 --> 44:35.840]  offered double kingships turned them both down
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.640]  double kingships turned them both down and went back to his farm
[44:40.640 --> 44:43.440]  and then was clearly assassinated by his doctor later the evidence that came
[44:43.440 --> 44:47.520]  out the founder of modern psychiatry killed george washington the evidence
[44:47.520 --> 44:51.680]  is overwhelming killed george washington bleeding
[44:51.680 --> 44:54.560]  him to death because he was fighting the illuminati
[44:54.560 --> 44:57.920]  and was getting ready to go public even though he was in bad health and fight
[44:57.920 --> 45:02.480]  them and wrote letters saying that
[45:02.560 --> 45:04.960]  because he didn't want to see a french revolution here where they killed
[45:04.960 --> 45:07.760]  timber some of the population and not even the wealthy
[45:07.760 --> 45:10.720]  it was a inner group of wealthy wanting to take over and
[45:10.720 --> 45:14.480]  have a nine-day work week and change the seasons and break up families and
[45:14.480 --> 45:19.200]  make boys dress like girls and girls like boys and break down society and
[45:19.200 --> 45:23.120]  torture everyone and kill everyone you know i read that 1984 passage about
[45:23.120 --> 45:26.480]  trampling and being trampled not a society that judges itself by getting
[45:26.480 --> 45:29.200]  better but by getting worse that's jackabin
[45:29.200 --> 45:35.200]  illuminati the satanists say that they are all about
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.920]  empowering the individual and all about no no no they're about
[45:39.920 --> 45:43.040]  totally dominating anyone ever able to compete with them
[45:43.040 --> 45:47.840]  and murdering and torturing and killing and burning and destroying
[45:47.840 --> 45:51.440]  again if you're a radiation person working power plants work on nuclear
[45:51.440 --> 45:55.440]  aircraft carriers submarines retired currently working there radiologist
[45:55.440 --> 45:58.400]  physicist nuclear physicist we want to hear from you
[45:58.400 --> 46:02.960]  i can't call dr bob bowman anymore nuclear physicist he's dead
[46:02.960 --> 46:08.720]  we had buzz beyond chemical and theoretical physicists last week
[46:08.720 --> 46:14.480]  we want to get your take on all this 800 259 92 31
[46:14.480 --> 46:18.880]  but you've got to understand what we're fighting is the same energy force that
[46:18.880 --> 46:23.280]  we've been fighting all along that can manifest in chinese in jews
[46:23.280 --> 46:29.920]  in germans in mexicans in anybody it is the same system of psychopathic
[46:29.920 --> 46:33.680]  control freak behavior that builds the same structures every time
[46:33.680 --> 46:37.280]  pyramids with children being sacrificed at the top of them
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.320]  like a certain breed of spider you could take spider eggs they've done this and
[46:42.320 --> 46:48.000]  freeze them and 20 years later unfreeze them
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.440]  and the spiders will you know come out and build the same web
[46:51.440 --> 46:56.880]  you can take papyrus seeds out of a 3 000 year old egyptian tomb
[46:56.880 --> 47:01.440]  and plant them in the nile delta and they will come back up
[47:01.440 --> 47:05.120]  same deal it's a wavelength it's a genetic spiritual code
[47:05.120 --> 47:08.720]  it's a system we're fighting the very same thing that we've
[47:08.720 --> 47:11.840]  gone up against over and over again you get that you are now in the skews of
[47:11.840 --> 47:17.440]  george washington staring into an illuminati jackabin onslaught
[47:17.440 --> 47:20.400]  again the minute we launched our revolution of course they had double
[47:20.400 --> 47:24.080]  agents in our operation as well this is our ancestors but i'm
[47:24.080 --> 47:27.200]  speaking for them you can speak for them you are them
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.280]  you understand that genetically you are them you to your mother your father
[47:31.280 --> 47:34.800]  back physically in a connection to your ancestors
[47:34.800 --> 47:40.160]  like electricity through time genetics is actually a projection like a particle
[47:40.160 --> 47:45.680]  beam traveling through the space time continuum
[47:45.680 --> 47:50.880]  and you have to decide to allow that spiritual charge of goodness
[47:50.880 --> 47:54.480]  from the past to then be risen up to fight the evil
[47:54.480 --> 47:59.840]  that is also transmitting the same way through its agents
[48:01.120 --> 48:04.480]  and this isn't even spiritual or new agey stuff folks
[48:04.480 --> 48:11.600]  this is epigenetic facts this is a reality and i've got all this news i've
[48:11.600 --> 48:14.960]  even gotten to yet and i said i'm going to get to your calls
[48:14.960 --> 48:18.400]  the point is the tide is rising for america's libertarians new spirit is
[48:18.400 --> 48:21.600]  rising climate of anti-politics has become an attitude rather than a
[48:21.600 --> 48:26.320]  movement it's not anti-politics though it's anti-fraudulent manipulated left
[48:26.320 --> 48:30.000]  right controlled by the globalists that carol quickly wrote about
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.280]  there's an awakening to that across the board of live and let live
[48:35.280 --> 48:39.280]  and the system doesn't like it it's trying to figure out how to hijack it
[48:39.280 --> 48:45.040]  and turn it into a french revolution instead of our 1776 the minute our
[48:45.040 --> 48:49.200]  forebears launched the 1776 they launched the 1776
[48:49.200 --> 48:56.160]  in engelstock university in germany into france into england
[48:56.160 --> 49:06.480]  using the masonic order as a medium like cuter in a petri dish to grow
[49:06.480 --> 49:10.720]  using government institutions military institutions to come in with their cult
[49:10.720 --> 49:15.360]  takeovers and takeover operations and that's exactly what george washington
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.440]  wrote about as a mason to other masons warning them
[49:19.440 --> 49:22.400]  and most masons are total illuminati captured now
[49:22.400 --> 49:25.040]  they don't even know it they're there to provide provide money for the central
[49:25.040 --> 49:29.920]  committees to be sent on for operations so
[49:29.920 --> 49:33.200]  this is the issue and i'm not indicting anybody okay
[49:33.200 --> 49:36.960]  my point is it's a fact you better face it and
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.480]  we are the future and and believe me i don't like this responsibility
[49:42.480 --> 49:45.920]  of being at the very tip of the spear in this but it is something that i am
[49:45.920 --> 49:49.280]  going to go forward in it is something that i am
[49:49.280 --> 49:52.000]  going to embrace i may have to take some days off
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.120]  here and there in the future to just get rested and get myself ready for all
[49:55.120 --> 49:58.080]  this for all the things that are coming because i realize if i work six seven
[49:58.080 --> 50:03.200]  eight days a week 15 hours a day i i then am too exhausted
[50:03.200 --> 50:07.200]  but i am going to up my game in a more focused way against these people
[50:07.200 --> 50:12.160]  because total history is happening and all i can say to you out there is
[50:12.160 --> 50:16.000]  you're living history right now don't think you're just a spectator in a bystander
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.400]  get out of your comfort zone realize the urgency of what's happening
[50:20.400 --> 50:26.720]  currently and realize you're in a total war a total war against death
[50:26.720 --> 50:33.920]  a total war against systematic mechanized organized evil
[50:33.920 --> 50:37.120]  that is establishing
[50:38.400 --> 50:44.800]  a planetary technocracy a a a technological coup break away
[50:44.800 --> 50:49.600]  civilization development to hyper dominate the species forever
[50:49.600 --> 50:53.760]  in an ultimate act of of of human sacrifice

[55:30.720 --> 55:34.160]  them more money oh it's so liberal that's why all
[55:34.160 --> 55:37.920]  the big rich guys funded obama because they wanted to give you free health
[55:37.920 --> 55:41.600]  care because they loved you and if you don't like it you're
[55:41.600 --> 55:45.280]  racist i mean does anyone really believe this well you're now believing

[55:50.320 --> 55:53.440]  we're going to be getting into uh just just so much here
[55:53.440 --> 55:58.400]  uh that's in my stacks of news we're going to be breaking it all
[55:58.400 --> 56:01.920]  down ladies and gentlemen and meanwhile the communist chinese and the
[56:01.920 --> 56:04.800]  globalists are talking about having a war with each other in the south china
[56:04.800 --> 56:09.200]  sea that's up on info wars dot com red linked i mean i know it's not as
[56:09.200 --> 56:12.800]  important as the playoff game last night but you know if there is a nuclear war
[56:12.800 --> 56:15.600]  and it might it might be almost as important as a
[56:15.600 --> 56:20.240]  playoff game also future sheriff says protesters should be
[56:20.240 --> 56:26.480]  exterminated in gas chambers that just broke neocon calls for
[56:26.480 --> 56:30.240]  us military action against al qaeda they put in charge in western iraq
[56:30.240 --> 56:34.640]  oh yeah all this is very wonderful uh so right now let's go to your phone calls
[56:34.640 --> 56:37.280]  here uh heather in wyoming says he's a radiation
[56:37.280 --> 56:41.200]  tech radiology tech i wanted to get her take on the radiation levels being
[56:41.200 --> 56:43.520]  confirmed by the health departments out in
[56:43.520 --> 56:48.240]  california bless you alex jones i want to first
[56:48.240 --> 56:51.840]  say that radiation exposure is linear and non-threshold
[56:51.840 --> 56:56.160]  which means you know even a little bit amount of radiation
[56:56.160 --> 57:00.400]  there is a negative effect somewhere that can accumulate
[57:00.400 --> 57:04.320]  secondly that radiation exposure on the west coast
[57:04.320 --> 57:09.280]  it's low dose of an unknown particulate matter
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.760]  and it's going to be a chronic exposure now we don't have a whole lot of science
[57:13.760 --> 57:18.880]  on that in itself except first year noble but uh
[57:18.880 --> 57:22.800]  there's a predominant period in latent periods with radiation exposure and i
[57:22.800 --> 57:28.800]  would say we would see negative adverse effects much later
[57:28.800 --> 57:32.160]  like clusters of thyroid and bone cancers breast cancers
[57:32.160 --> 57:37.760]  cataracts leukemia that will um happen probably much much later in
[57:37.760 --> 57:40.560]  time so it's very difficult to say and we need more
[57:40.560 --> 57:44.080]  information about what these particles are exactly and that's something that
[57:44.080 --> 57:47.920]  major media with huge funding major newspapers
[57:47.920 --> 57:51.760]  health departments state governments federal government should be responding
[57:51.760 --> 57:54.880]  to instead when we force this out in the open
[57:54.880 --> 57:58.560]  with info wars dot com and drudge report dot com and others talking about it
[57:58.560 --> 58:01.760]  they just go okay it's increased but we're not going to investigate why
[58:01.760 --> 58:05.360]  and it's that attitude of we never look oh that you know the dust at the world
[58:05.360 --> 58:08.800]  trade center is not bad for you but they knew it was bad and covered it up
[58:08.800 --> 58:12.560]  agent orange isn't bad for humans they knew full well it would kill them
[58:12.560 --> 58:17.600]  i mean it's just this evil attitude that's increasing
[58:17.600 --> 58:21.120]  well i agree and and that's all i really have to add we need to get more
[58:21.120 --> 58:24.240]  information before we even kind of even speculate
[58:24.240 --> 58:28.320]  on what can happen and um but it's not good i mean i'm taking your
[58:28.320 --> 58:32.800]  nation iodine i've been taking it you know since you started it out and i'm
[58:32.800 --> 58:37.520]  giving it to my family and um that's about all that i can do
[58:37.520 --> 58:40.800]  absolutely we'll be right back stay with us thank you
[58:40.800 --> 58:48.320]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcm live dot com today
[58:50.240 --> 58:54.640]  the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic
[58:54.640 --> 58:58.400]  members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive
[58:58.400 --> 59:01.680]  ability of the american people so why are the social
[59:01.680 --> 59:04.560]  engineers adding it to the water simple
[59:04.560 --> 59:09.280]  dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on
[59:09.280 --> 59:12.720]  we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[59:12.720 --> 59:16.480]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to
[59:16.480 --> 59:19.760]  announce the exclusive info wars live fluoride shield
[59:19.760 --> 59:23.680]  formulation fusing six of the best documented ingredients
[59:23.680 --> 59:28.240]  from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues
[59:28.240 --> 59:31.280]  from the body but a whole host of toxic substances
[59:31.280 --> 59:34.720]  let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with
[59:34.720 --> 59:38.000]  fluoride shield i use fluoride shield every day
[59:38.000 --> 59:42.240]  secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations at info wars
[59:42.240 --> 59:45.600]  live dot com today let's start cleansing our bodies now
[59:45.600 --> 59:49.360]  and support the info war at the same time that's info wars life
[59:49.360 --> 59:54.320]  dot com
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:32.320]  texas alex jones
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.200]  well if you just joined us china set to see south china island by force from
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.760]  the philippines
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.760]  that will undoubtedly trigger military action by the west
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.720]  that's being reported in major publications in china that are
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:56.720]  government approved so this is a huge escalation that's up on info wars
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.600]  dot com coming up at the bottom of the hour
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.360]  we have a doctor popping in to give his take on the increased radiation levels
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.320]  coming in from the new fukushima wave we're getting a short report at the
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.440]  start of the next hour we'll get a few more this week and then
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.760]  move on but i'm just simply trying to
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.600]  ascertain how serious the radiation waves coming in from fukushima are on the
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.560]  west coast and we found up to 10 times ourselves of normal
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:30.240]  background radiation or a thousand percent others have found 1400
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.960]  percent the health department confirmed 500 plus percent in one spot
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.800]  they checked said it's no big deal and in the past this would be a big deal
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.080]  that's been confirmed so we're there focusing on it but we're
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.880]  going to continue with your calls get into a bunch of news this hour
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.440]  obviously on a host of issues but let's go to justin in washington
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.640]  says he worked for a company that builds the pumps for reactors
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.640]  and is going to give his take on this situation
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.160]  how big of a deal is this or what do you think's really going on here
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.000]  well alex um i i was living over in track cities and i was working for a
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.800]  company that designed the pump and treat system
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.560]  and you know i went out there i did the b-reactor tour it was
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.480]  is this incredible and how much work went into that but
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.160]  i really didn't like they really didn't tell you exactly
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.040]  everything until i moved out of track cities and then i heard i'm like i was
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.400]  like listening to the radio while i was driving the moving truck out of track
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.280]  cities and uh it's funny how much they talk
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.480]  about hamford outside of track cities like can you live in
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.280]  there like oh yeah you're good you're good but then
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.040]  you like once i moved over to seattle i actually got to hear the people talk
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.800]  about like oh no the leaks are you know they're leaking and it's not
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.280]  very good and i was cracking me up
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:53.120]  well i mean that's the attitude even with du with the troops is
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.400]  this is nothing to worry about this is no big deal but
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.080]  25 30 years ago they wouldn't let them use du saying that low exposure would
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.600]  end up killing you but it kills you 25 years later so you don't get
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.880]  blamed for it it's called soft kill appreciate the call
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:12.080]  uh let's talk to the nothing radiation technician
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.440]  radiology technician hospital what's your take on this
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.760]  well my take is the lord says the meek shall inherit the earth
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.360]  he said he'd set his angels down to cast out demons
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.800]  what makes you think those angels aren't human beings
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:30.720]  well sir i appreciate i appreciate your call but we we
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.320]  we don't string calls unless it's on a subject

[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.280]  on the radiation wave now slamming into the west coast we're continuing
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:04.800]  our coverage and investigation of that and i want to hear from you if you think
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.400]  it's a serious threat from the different reports that we've gotten
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.280]  with our own geiger counters with our reporters
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.960]  that are popping in at the beginning of the next hour
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:18.400]  and what your take is on all of this but there's going to be a ton of other
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:23.200]  news we're going to cover in the meantime let me get some of that right now
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.480]  again i covered this last hour but i want to mention it again now
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.640]  the tide is rising for american libertarians financial times of london
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.440]  the new spirit is is a rising climate of anti politics
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.960]  has become an attitude rather than a movement and it's true
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.160]  what you call libertarians are people that are living let live they're just
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.080]  humans they don't want to fight with people
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.320]  they don't want racial politics or party politics they want freedom
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.760]  whether it's guns or whether it's drug decriminalization or
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.440]  whether it's not having regulations on hair cutting places
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:02.080]  uh or peace they're just americans they're they're renaissance type people
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.680]  who are true classical liberals like thomas jefferson
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.400]  that's what it is common sense you shouldn't have the federal government
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.600]  running the schools much less teaching two plus two equals five
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.880]  done the government's evil trying to screw up the kids brains to control them
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.000]  you guys are done big pharma comes out and admits
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.880]  their plan under the new freedom initiative 10 years ago when it started
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.800]  was to put go from 10 percent of kids on psychotropic to 20 percent
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.480]  and in the next decade we're now four years into that
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.680]  they wanted to go to 50 percent on psychotropic drugs
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.440]  and then finally they want to go above 90 percent on the drugs
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.480]  and that got leaked by people that were part of the new freedom initiative on
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:48.960]  the board saying this is evil this is a diabolical plan and my point is
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.720]  the fruits of this are as bad as it gets
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.600]  i'm going to cover this more in the days to come but
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.560]  this is a big issue and it shows where things are going there's another
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.240]  article that's up on info wars dot com that is so incredibly
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:08.560]  important uh by ron paul congress defers the president on nsa
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:13.360]  reform it is congress's law enforcement
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:20.480]  edict to actually create the laws and then enforce on the executive and the
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:25.520]  rest of the bureaucracy via control of the purse spring
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:31.040]  the implementation via the purse string to
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.720]  enforce the constitution and bill of rights and they're not doing that
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.800]  and so this is such a big deal
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.080]  to have ron paul
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.440]  come out and expose what's happening here we need to understand it's part of a
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.240]  larger program it's part of a larger takeover uh here is the article in the
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.800]  washington times year of action obama vows to act on his own
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:03.680]  when necessary and you have congress coming out and
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.680]  saying well we're just going to let you do whatever you want
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:13.760]  passing the buck supporting dictatorial movements in the executive
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.040]  and it's a big deal to have ron paul call this what it is tyranny
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.480]  it's a big deal to have ted grooves come out and and call obama dangerous
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.840]  and frightening because that's what it is and you're like but
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.040]  why is it a big move for them to tell the truth because we have to up our
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:31.440]  rhetoric to reality when things are
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:38.000]  sensational when things are out of control when things are crazy
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.920]  when things are incredibly oppressive
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.920]  we have a responsibility
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:54.240]  as a nation as a people to then tell it like it is
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.920]  now getting into some other articles so people understand what we're facing
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.880]  department of energy
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:09.920]  plugs energy rating for homes similar to mpg rating for cars and then again
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.680]  they won't let homes be reinsured or worked on
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.160]  or upgraded or changed under a jenny 21 this has already been done in europe
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.680]  and australia they literally have zoning police green police you name it
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.440]  and then they can add fines fees regulations and then they even want
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:30.080]  systems with software to track and surveil everything you're doing in
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.880]  your house through the smart meter that then just by accident
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:40.160]  all the new appliances the last five years are set with specifications and
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.400]  chips that wirelessly report everything back to the
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.200]  government robot that's been plopped on the side of your house
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.280]  that's literally a government nsa spy robot if it was a guy in a black suit
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.880]  with black sunglasses black dye you would go out and say how dare you
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.960]  have a glass to your ear listening to my window
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.480]  but it's just a little box it's on the side of your house and of course
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.560]  microwaves you as well uses microwave transmitting
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.320]  blurp technology and blurp communications is what i call it you
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.440]  know the flash communications blasting through your house there's the health
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:19.120]  issues but so what we're going to tax you by the mile in your car we're tracking

[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.000]  suckers all the cars got boxes and we're tracking you and we're going to
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.440]  attach you and then once we put the robot cars on the streets it's already
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.760]  happening we're going to show that they're even safer
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.360]  we're going to make you buy wireless packages with us for the robot to
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:41.200]  control everything you're doing you're not going to be able to drive
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.600]  everything you do is going to be tracked and we're going to know what kind of
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.480]  food you're buying for your kids and your family and give that to the insurance
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.160]  companies and you're going to get cps visits your kids aren't eating healthy
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.640]  i mean folks this is a nightmare where everything you do is in a file
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.480]  with some aggressive predatory bug-eyed pedophile
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.400]  cps agent or some crazy sheriff's deputy
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.520]  like the one reportedly up on info wars dot com
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:11.600]  saying i would beat your bleeping bleep just for the sheer joy of it
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:16.320]  and says that any protesters that film police should be put in gas chambers and
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:22.400]  beaten
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.080]  i mean this is the type of stuff folks this is because they go now
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.360]  in in these major globalist cities and they're hiring now people that are goons
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.280]  and who literally want to be able with overwhelming force
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.320]  with everybody else's hands tied knowing you're facing felonies
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.160]  to beat you and attack you and then charge you with a felony
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.000]  when they attack you and this is how north korea works this is how Mexico
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.040]  works this is how we now are going to work
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:53.200]  now there's an internal fight inside the police forces nationwide
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.560]  and some departments are really good and honorable and and they're pretty much
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.960]  either good and honorable or they're pure evil
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.080]  there's not really a luke warm anymore it's just either going to hell
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.440]  or the police are circling the wagons and fighting the federal takeover
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.640]  and trying to be human beings but i just cannot explain to you how serious
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.720]  the situation is let's go back to your phone calls
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.680]  ralph in oklahoma and then we'll go to frank uh in texas ralph you say you're
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:20.480]  a nuclear worker what a nuclear power plant
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:26.160]  uh worked in the power plants uh gives all the inspections first according to
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:32.000]  hills corporation it was silkwood place uh inspected prime bluff inspected
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.600]  incommunicate uh what what can i what what can i do
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:41.280]  what can i tell you well i wanted to ask you i mean is 1400
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:45.120]  percent higher radiation in san francisco beaches
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.800]  is that an issue in the past that they would make a big deal out of it
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.440]  uh i i i talked to the radiation specialist the radiologists they say
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:56.240]  that in the past this would be a big deal but now there's a
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.520]  touchy feeling attitude that like anculture said maybe it's good for
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:04.000]  you what's your take on that well if it's that much the new
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.120]  commission over it be shutting things down doing something with this
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:12.240]  said on the i'm not that educated on the
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:16.640]  that i done i've had some friends being to it tell me about
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.560]  uh but i guess people need to take this upon their own
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:25.120]  because you don't know unless you can buy you a survey meter which y'all are
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:29.120]  calling a tiger counter there is there is so you can buy those
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:33.760]  relatively cheap if you're out there i'm surprised that california's letting
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:38.000]  us go on as as stringent as their laws are because they had been on me a few
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.800]  times over my inspections out there and saying i couldn't do that i had to
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.920]  rewrite reports and things before they would accept
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.800]  stuff well see there's just covering their butt to act like they're trying to
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.760]  protect people but then yeah they don't want to go out and clean up these
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.400]  beaches or or go and find out where it's really
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:57.920]  coming from they just want to deny it because there's not some private
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.120]  contractor that they can harass let me guess you're a private
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.960]  contractor these are government people that are harassing you
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:10.080]  uh yeah the government be all on you i talked to uh
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.000]  a person who was in the government pretty heavy and they had said we were
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  talking on phony uh i told them well it's a nuclear worker and
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.920]  uh you used to call me the cobalt kid i was into it so much
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.960]  uh he said i think we need to get off the phone now don't be telling anybody
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.120]  that you were a nuclear worker the government is going to be on your butt
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:35.360]  i mean when you need to get them in there over some bad stuff but
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:40.320]  actually hurting people over exposing people they didn't give a rat pass
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:44.560]  but now if you made a if you you know a little bit mistake that'd be on you
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.680]  it'd be on your life well i don't rise oh yeah i know because they want to cover
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.480]  their butts when everything starts melting down and falling apart because
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.000]  they're letting these plants go 35 40 years when they're only supposed to go
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.840]  25 30 years and so that's what this is the bureaucrats are just
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.360]  going to scapegoat people that didn't dot eyes cross t's
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.920]  when you were told to do that and exactly they're going to scapegoat you
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:10.960]  guys that's absolutely how this works yeah that went on too much because uh
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:16.160]  if you like making your big money which the the nuclear workers the the
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.600]  inspectors and things out there be laughing at this if you want to make
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:23.920]  that big money it can now shut your damn job
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.040]  or we can get somebody there's another person in line here
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.880]  i've seen so many people they dug off the streets of put in these places
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:35.920]  that didn't know a rat but i took the grief to get into this
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.520]  and these people didn't do nothing three months on the bill they're shooting
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.120]  they're shooting damage now i hear they have a homeless people
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.240]  nothing against homeless folks but i don't want them doing brain surgery on
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.960]  me doing the cleanup of Fukushima that one rod touches it all blows up
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:57.600]  and so the answer is send in elderly homeless drunks to uh do the uh do the
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.480]  inspection thank you so much we'll be right back

[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:28.320]  radiation waves that fox news is reporting are coming into the west
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:32.480]  coast as the plant on the ocean side in the
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.160]  pacific in japan continues to melt down and we're
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.920]  going to shift gears into some other news coming up later as well
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:44.320]  most of the third hour will be geopolitical news
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:48.160]  chris christy news and even though this chris christy thing is a diversion at a
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.840]  certain level it's an illustration of the arrogance and corruption
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.160]  and now the feds are probing christy and the fact that this is the supposed
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.920]  frontrunner for the republicans a anti-gun open borders
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:05.520]  thug just shows how they just put forward john mccain or
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:10.320]  whoever they want and put forward hillary who's incredibly unpopular
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:15.760]  because it's a ruling corrupt group that's hijacked the country
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.680]  and i know you know that and all the numbers show that and
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.200]  even the establishment publications like the financial times of london say
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.520]  the government's discredited no one likes the government
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.200]  people are sick of fighting with each other they believe that they have a
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.960]  criminal system and want to change it and people want freedom
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:38.880]  not your racist if you don't want obama carry your racist if you don't
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.520]  want to turn your guns in people are smart enough to go
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.320]  i'm a racist if i don't turn my gun in black people and folks are smart they're
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.520]  going what's a gun have to do with that i i need a gun to protect myself
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.360]  now everybody realizes obama carries a big screw job and
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.800]  people that were against it weren't against it because they were racist
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.200]  they were against it because they knew it was a horrible screw job
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.560]  and so it's just the baloney isn't working anymore is what i'm getting a
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:14.320]  let's go to frank in texas nuclear navy tech what is your take on this
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.200]  should we not make a big deal out of this and try to get a national discourse
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.840]  going on the radiation wave as i'm trying to do
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.840]  covering this every day lately or are we on the right track from your
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.720]  perspective frank well i think it's a huge deal
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:32.480]  we treated every drop of radioactive substance as a
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:40.480]  as a major deal so basically if the levels are where they're at
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.560]  we should really be treating it like a a contamination area
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:50.800]  you know controlled contamination area and i don't think that the government
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.080]  wants to admit to it because who's going to pay for it's going to cost
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:58.800]  too much money so you know the we were kind of taught
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.840]  is a little bit of a joke but the solution to pollution is
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:05.680]  dilution but you know i don't think we should just let
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.480]  nature take its course we got to do something
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:13.680]  um couple points that you know depends on what type of particle
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.680]  you're detecting and you know there's high energy ones that move fast or slow
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.920]  heavy ones got to figure out what it is exactly and
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:25.680]  that's not my job we're out there with the field meters out there with the
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.960]  modern geiger counters the health department confirms the numbers we're
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:32.400]  getting and so that's all we're doing is as
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.800]  professional reporters but not radiologists but we're having radiologists on
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:40.400]  we're trying to find out for myself and my family i want to know
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.400]  and so that's what i'm trying to do is just get a discourse going so we can
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.760]  not ignore this because in the past they wouldn't ignore this like this i've
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.880]  studied it they wouldn't ignore it as bad and it's part of this
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:54.240]  attitude of like the deadly dust at the world trade center
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.440]  they should have told people hey it's dangerous if you want to be around it
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.720]  that's your issue but you should wear breathing protection but they went oh
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.080]  no there's no issue even though they told EPA workers you wear
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.960]  mask don't be in the area this is going to kill people
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:10.640]  it's that i mean that's that that's that's criminal
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:14.080]  to your job is to tell folks if an area is dangerous
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.640]  and then you lie to them and tell them it's not dangerous aren't you in a way
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.200]  assaulting them isn't that a form of murder
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:30.160]  frank commonality between between the public they they don't want to know
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.520]  and they don't want to deal with it so there you go
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.880]  you know i think you're right i think a lot of it is the public
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.760]  has a attitude of giving up and so they're not upset they're not pushing
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.760]  and a fish doesn't just rot from the head it can rot both ways
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:50.000]  i agree that it is the general malaise of the public that empowers all this evil
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:57.040]  what do you think we should do uh i guess you know continue to use different
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:01.600]  types of detectors warn the public uh time distance
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.720]  shielding limit your time stay away from it and
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.160]  wear clothes you know clothes will stop some of the particles
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.920]  from actually absorbing to your skin just like you know going on the sun
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:15.200]  uh one one one kind of tidbit the average person receives

[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.400]  the the rocks in the soil and that's particularly from rayon
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:28.320]  you know so you can you can limit that exposure by just wearing clothes and
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:32.800]  staying away from the beaches the beaches that they had to hire them out
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.320]  and protect your thyroid with things like iodine do you agree with that exactly
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:40.240]  big time oh yeah i take i'll take uh driver's shield board shield

[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:04.960]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:08.240]  and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:12.560]  now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen

[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.200]  in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.400]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:27.360]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:32.400]  reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:36.080]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important

[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.400]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american people
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.240]  so why are the social engineers adding it to the water
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:19.040]  symbol dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.680]  on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:25.200]  the water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our bodies
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:29.120]  i am extremely excited to announce the exclusive info wars life

[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:41.520]  i will shift gears into all the other geopolitical economic military news
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.960]  there's so much incredible information i'm going to cover
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:48.320]  the globalists think we're so dumb they're openly saying they want to invade
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:52.640]  iraq again in central and western iraq to kick out al-qaeda
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:55.840]  when our government's been funding al-qaeda protecting al-qaeda
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.440]  giving them amphetamines medium weapons anti aircraft weapons then gauze the
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.720]  whole nine yards to attack the entire region
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:08.320]  and the goal is destabilization
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:12.080]  so you put al-qaeda in place you can then come kick them out
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:16.960]  it's incredible absolutely incredible so i'm going to break that down
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:22.560]  as well uh dr rick davis is an md he's headed up a whole bunch of
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.480]  well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with numerous
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:34.240]  us patents and trademarks under its belt uh ogenics.com is the website ogenics.com
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:40.080]  and he serves as lieutenant commander of the u.s navy and worked as an emergency
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.040]  medical physician naval flight surgeon at navy seals you name it
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.480]  and hyperbaric diving medical officer he received his md
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.560]  from the medical college of virginia with honors in 81 he graduated
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:56.480]  magna cum laude with a bs in chemistry from old dominion university in 77
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:00.080]  when i was uh four years old i guess five years old no i was about four years
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.360]  old then point is is that are even younger three years old
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:07.680]  but he joins us for the balance of this hour
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:14.960]  to give us his take on 91% of nuclear reactors leaking now that's
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.600]  according to the un they just don't seem to care anymore
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.960]  they don't care if the troops are in and around du don't even decontaminate them
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.800]  now uh didn't even used to let them use it till 1990 hard to
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:30.080]  believe it was that many years ago 24 years ago and it's just a total
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.480]  culture shift so i've had dr dug rocky the former head of the du program on
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:39.440]  who wrote the book before they even used it on du and he says absolutely don't
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:42.480]  use it and we're not talking about du today the point is
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:45.120]  is that it's not just about radiation hitting the west coast or coming over
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:48.160]  in the air all over the u.s canada you name it
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:51.440]  in the northern hemisphere more than double the radiation it was
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:55.360]  in 1945 it's about an attitude across the board
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.880]  of not caring about the increased radiation levels not about gmo
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:06.480]  sterilizing the lab animals not caring about what the fluoride does and we
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.680]  turns out it's on purpose what does he think is a really educated smart guy
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.600]  he's been on the nightly news with leon macadoo uh last week
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.160]  what is a what does he think the danger is where does he think fukushima is
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:24.160]  going because he studied it and also obviously been in the navy
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.280]  and what does he think this is all indicative of is this just mass mental
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.280]  illness or is it orchestrated we know part of it's orchestrated
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.120]  or are the mentally ill people believing that they're in control
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:38.880]  as many crazy people do so there's a method to the madness but it's still
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.600]  madness i mean where does he think it's all going so
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:45.440]  what's happening who's behind it and where does he think it's going
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:51.760]  thank you so much for joining us here on the transmission uh today again the
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:55.120]  website is ogenex.com dr rick
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:59.200]  davis medical doctor thank you for coming on thank you alex for having me
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:03.840]  it's uh great to speak with you and you asked me a very broad question you
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:06.400]  asked me where do i think this is going
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:10.640]  who do i think is behind this and what is the end game
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:14.880]  and i personally believe that the same people that are behind
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:18.640]  the nuclear disaster which you've mentioned in a number of areas you know
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.080]  the leaking plants fukushima itself du
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.240]  etc and the entire atomic energy system
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.000]  is coordinated and manifested by the same people
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.480]  who are in control of everything else the gmo all the soft kill
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:38.160]  that's going on across the world is orchestrated
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.680]  it has to be these things don't happen by accident you don't have
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.640]  you know you don't by happenstance get a waiver to put a nuclear station on a
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.760]  fault line that doesn't just happen by magic
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:52.560]  there has to be a coordinated effort of people
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.800]  to to do this and of course it is the epitome of insanity
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.920]  and i believe that the people who run this planet
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.520]  are in fact psychopaths we've talked about that before
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.960]  and i believe that if you were to look at the total spectrum
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:10.960]  of the different ways that they would uh want to take control of society to
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:14.320]  bring about this utopia that they perceive as a
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.080]  the new world order you know a single government single currency
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:22.080]  single religion single science um those people
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.760]  would look at every opportunity i mean these are very very smart people
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.200]  uh far smarter than you and i and they would look at
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:34.160]  how can we go about accomplishing this plan they put together extensive
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:36.800]  business plans they'd run computer simulations
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:40.400]  they would figure out what are the best ways to accomplish the things that we
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.920]  want and they'd have a plan a plan b plan c
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.360]  a whole tiered structure of of countermeasures uh to the actions that
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:53.600]  those of us who are sane and human and want a better life for ourselves and
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.200]  our family they would have means and and methods
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.960]  put in place they'd have strategies they'd have
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.560]  you know all of the logistics and everything put together in order to try
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:08.880]  and combat common sense and i think that that's what
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.120]  we're seeing i mean let's take Fukushima for example
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.520]  here is a perfect situation where you have the perfect storm
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:22.400]  you have an incident which i still am not completely clear that this was an
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:26.880]  entirely natural event there were uh have been a lot of reports by
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.120]  alternative media sources who claim to have uh more information than i do
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.400]  personally uh that this may not have been an entirely
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:38.400]  natural event and if that's the case it would be
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.600]  put in the category of a false flag much like a 9 11
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:45.520]  where the plane is the deception and the deception comes in and then the
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:48.720]  buildings come down but the buildings obviously were
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:52.320]  were detonated and and that's been proven i think beyond a shadow of a doubt
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.800]  from any scientific perspective at this point
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.040]  sure and it shows just the mass mental illness but but a lot of psychopaths
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.600]  and other you know forms of mentally ill people to have high
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.560]  intelligence they will tend throughout history to develop crazy plans and
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:10.160]  now they've got movies coming out about people in love with their computers
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:13.760]  about uh johnny depp uploading his brain into a computer
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:17.920]  this is all ray Kurzweil this is all google this is all DARPA
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:21.600]  this is what they said in the 30s they were going to do in all their white
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.640]  papers and you've got to hand it to them they've actually built it so
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.560]  they don't care in fact they want the radiation to increase they want the gmo
[01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:32.400]  to wreck the earth because they believe they're going to have such advanced
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.320]  genetic technology and and also nano tech and
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:40.800]  to be able to merge these systems and create a new world
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:45.280]  and basically create unlimited planets and so who cares if
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.800]  they destroy this one in the process of keeping us
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.480]  the non-evil folks from taking control and that really is
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.760]  their cosmology and so i was about to say before you said it
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:58.880]  they with computer programs even when they built this plant
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.760]  back in the 80s or i guess late 70s they put them on fault lines
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.680]  all over the place most the power plants are and they can do actuaries even
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:11.120]  back then knowing statistically these are going to melt down there's going
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.680]  to be tsunamis there's going to be earthquakes
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.880]  they knew what they were doing and then they're already ready and i've read
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:19.520]  their own writings and they say this themselves on many
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.800]  issues to then use the crises they create
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:26.880]  in a societal stampede like a war you start like funding al-qaeda
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.520]  then you take liberties to fight the force you funded
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:33.200]  creating these global crises they then know we will stampede
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.400]  and give them our energy our resources
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.600]  our support to then support their next phase of the plan
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.760]  so it's really like ancient hunters would beat on drums and have fires
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.960]  and chase mastodons off cliffs that's what they're doing to us
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.040]  well you're exactly right i think that you know if you look at the
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.280]  the basic mantra that these people live by it's
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:01.280]  an order out of chaos and obviously it's order for them
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:07.680]  and chaos for us and we have to to understand that if this is in fact the
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:12.480]  plan that this radiation threat which is now
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:15.280]  becoming more than a threat obviously your team is out
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.840]  measuring this and you have you know the various hot spots along the west coast
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.680]  of this country and you'll see that because you know
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:27.680]  a current is not you know the kerosene current that comes sweeps down from
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:32.400]  from you know the arctic is not going to be homogenous it's going to hit the
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:35.680]  shore in different places and some more than others
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.600]  but this is clearly a threat to this country
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:43.600]  and my question to leanne when i spoke with her last week was
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:47.040]  why haven't the people you and i and in the public
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:51.280]  been made aware of the efforts by the government to protect us from this
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.000]  threat i mean if they're so interested in protecting us and
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.520]  taking our rights and surveilling us and doing all these other things
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.880]  it would have been a very simple and relatively inexpensive matter
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.480]  to track this radiation from the time that it leaves
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:08.720]  you know the shores of japan across the pacific and as it sweeps down
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.920]  heading towards the united states because in fact
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:16.000]  this potentially could be a threat to our health here in the united states
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.360]  if it does bioaccumulate and if you know if we have
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.640]  as you've said before from the moxery you're going to have plutonium and
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:27.280]  you know which is a highly toxic material not probably more so than many
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.320]  of the uranium and other things that are are leaking
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:34.720]  but if you look at this why haven't these questions been answered
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.920]  why hasn't the public been reassured by the government
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:40.720]  why hasn't the international atomic energy commission
[01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:44.720]  gone over to japan and worked with them much more closely
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:47.920]  why hasn't funding been developed on a global basis because this is going to
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:51.520]  be a global problem why have we left it to tepco
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:55.840]  to basically hang out to dry when this is really going to take
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:59.520]  a huge undertaking in order to get this under control much
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.520]  much worse than chernobyl these are my questions why haven't these
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:07.280]  relatively simple steps been taken of measurement
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:10.800]  you know the determination of of the level of the threat
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:14.400]  projections trends identifying those places that
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:18.480]  might over time become hazardous you know for swimming and
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:22.400]  and the rest of it none of this information has been forthcoming
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.160]  that does not happen by accident anybody who works
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:29.600]  around this material would understand immediately
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.480]  this threat and they would immediately take action
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:36.160]  to do these very simple things that i suggested so clearly
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.840]  this action is being suppressed sure actively
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.480]  actively well i'll tell you the bottom line plan and then i want to expand on
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.960]  and get your take doctor because you're obviously a really smart guy that has a
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:47.360]  deep well-rounded general knowledge of how the world
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:50.560]  works and i want to get you back in the future for
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:54.240]  a full hour you know to really get into all this but but bottom line
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.480]  let me just quantify all this for everybody and i want to get your take on
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.440]  it from their own writings but also their actions
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.800]  it's undoubted and i want to get your take on this a of you agree but b
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:06.400]  expand on it that this is what's happening the elite have decided they're
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:09.200]  god like every other megalomaniac from knee row to hitler
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.520]  but this time they've actually got the fruits of incredibly smart people
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.520]  developing systems compartmentalized like legos
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:23.120]  that are then taken and in black ops in corporate reservations then constructed
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.640]  tested and then deployed from beta to actual
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:31.760]  implementation and the plan is in the testing phase
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:35.360]  wreck everything order out of chaos poison the population
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:39.120]  where we physically can't have children anymore where there's mass die-offs
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:43.920]  and out of that medical practice practicing on us in a mass experiment
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:50.240]  developing systems of life extension uh regenerative systems for the elites
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:53.440]  out of the mass test with binary weapons and other systems
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:57.440]  on us and then they will so wreck the the biosphere
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:00.320]  that then they will play god being the heroes
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.640]  rebuilding it reinventing it but in the process removing the scourge as they
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:07.680]  see it as the mass of humanity i mean in a nutshell
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.080]  that is the cosmology but looking at this i don't even though they're very smart
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:15.600]  i think at a deep-seated level it's a rationale to just do evil
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.880]  because their plan is not going to work well i agree and i i think that you
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:24.320]  know if you take what you said sort of to the next step
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:28.160]  i think that the evil is coordinated on this planet i don't think that it
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.120]  happens by chance i don't think these people leave
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:34.000]  much to chance because they're far too bright to do that
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.760]  i mean they're they're they're twisted kind of demonic type people
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.360]  and they enjoy inflicting pain i mean this is something that
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.640]  is very difficult for the average person to understand because
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.880]  you know we love our families and we have you know fun and we enjoy things and
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.360]  we we have deep sensitivities and and we have this part of our humanity we
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.480]  have a conscience these people don't you know they don't
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:00.080]  have that they're wired differently they're they're fundamentally different
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.760]  than we are they enjoy killing they enjoy destruction
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:07.120]  and that's what they do they they they destroy things they don't they're not
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:10.880]  builders they're not creators they are destroyers
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:14.000]  and they have to use our creativity in order to
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.680]  basically reflect their their evil purposes because
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:20.960]  it's just like a gun i mean we've talked you you've talked about this a
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.160]  million times a gun is an inanimate object it's neither
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:28.320]  good nor evil it can be used for both and they are able to take technology
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:32.640]  which is vastly superior in advance to what we now know i don't believe
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.160]  that they would have leased unleashed this radiation or any of these things
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:40.960]  GMO crops or you know the the chemtrails or any of that if they couldn't reverse it
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.160]  if they hadn't already probably have the technology
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:48.240]  to protect themselves from the scourge that they're releasing on the rest of us
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:52.560]  they probably already have it or at least they believe that they do
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.680]  and so at this time you know we're the suckers
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:59.040]  we're all sitting around basically waiting to be slaughtered
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:06.320]  and and i think that um my message is one of hope actually i you know so many people
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:10.000]  listen to your show and they they feel like you're a fearmonger or that you're
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.280]  depressing and yet i see you as an educator and
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.600]  you're bringing people awareness and if you look at history
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.200]  if if you look back through time you recognize that
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:25.520]  all tyrants make the same fatal mistake i've said this before
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:29.360]  they centralize their power because they don't trust anyone they kill those who
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.600]  are surrounding them because they don't trust them
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.520]  and they become isolated and the power becomes more concentrated
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:40.240]  and as you centralize control and command it becomes much more vulnerable
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:43.760]  and this is what has caused every tyrant to collapse in the past
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:47.360]  that's what's going to cause these people to collapse and and they as they
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:51.120]  become increasingly vulnerable you have a single building
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:55.280]  uh with the nsa i mean they're multiple but you've got this giant complex
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:58.160]  it's just one place where they have all of this information
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:03.280]  it's not distributed um and so again this is just an example
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:09.120]  um if we decide as the people globally i'm not talking about just americans
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:12.800]  here i see this awakening happening throughout the world
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.640]  i have friends all over the world very smart people uh all around the world
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:20.400]  they're becoming increasingly aware and becoming
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:25.920]  um ready to act they simply don't want to act individually
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:29.920]  they want to act in a coordinated fashion where you can actually take charge
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:33.440]  of this situation and do good and it is my belief
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.680]  that there will come an event a manufactured crisis of some sort
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.520]  that will become a crystallizing galvanizing
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:47.280]  uh event around which good people who have the the means and and the training
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:51.760]  and the ability to make change uh will be able to use that
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:56.480]  come together and in an orchestrated way bring to justice
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:00.000]  these megalomaniacs that have led our society
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.440]  for thousands of years i mean we've been under the same kind of
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:07.440]  Babylonian system of pyramids with a crazy person on top
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.440]  telling everybody else what to do and i think that we've reached a point
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.560]  where we've realized that we don't really need that of course we need
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:17.760]  government we need laws and not an anarchist but i think we don't want
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:20.880]  centralized systems run by psychos we're going to come back and break down
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:24.000]  solutions with what you're saying but but that's the key
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.360]  i'm here to get people out of their trance knowing there's smart people out
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.040]  there and then and then organically individuals together
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.680]  uh through a grassroots movement we will change things
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:39.760]  i'm just here to get people awake to the takedown of our civilization
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:43.200]  and who's behind it and i am yelling and screaming to get people out of their
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:46.560]  trance to get them up off their butts and then countless others like you
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:50.720]  doctor working together we will develop the
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:54.400]  solution against these enemies especially as things get worse and worse
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:57.840]  under their rule that's what's essential we'll be
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:02.560]  right back stay with us the facts are in the studies are
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:07.040]  legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:10.720]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american people
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:14.560]  so why are the social engineers adding it to the water
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:18.000]  simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.960]  the water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.480]  bodies i am extremely excited to announce the exclusive

[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:16.320]  hit yet there's more breaking so we're going to get into all of it
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:19.280]  here's the issue we've got to expose that there is a shadow corporate government
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:22.640]  which we've now done we've got to expose that they want us impoverished to control
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:25.840]  us and their main goal is set up planetary government to forcibly reduce
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:28.320]  population and a lot of people say well there are too
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:31.600]  many people well that that can be debated one way the other the point is
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:35.920]  this is an excuse for total authoritarianism a greedy capturing of all
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:38.960]  future technology in a breakaway civilization that's
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:41.840]  already there on record and the ultimate form of
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.360]  of discrimination it's an elysium type scenario
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:48.960]  but right here on earth and that's what they view
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.720]  COG for continuity of government in case there was a nuclear attack from the
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:55.920]  russians developed in the 40s and 50s and 60s
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:00.560]  they've used basically that plan to build the technocratic
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.800]  dehumanization government worldwide that's now phasing out
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:08.560]  incrementally the old systems which aren't perfect but aren't
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.160]  designed to be purely genocidal and you could see
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:15.600]  homeland security worldwide because governments all have the same system now
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:20.240]  in most areas it's designed not for COG but for collapse
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:23.840]  but to control the collapse and so they're getting ready to release
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:28.480]  superbugs they're getting ready for economic collapse wars
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:32.000]  they're lining up for all hell to break loose
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.520]  and doctor do you agree with that statement dr rick
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:41.840]  davis md uh ogenics.com that that that we can see all the forces
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:45.920]  lining up for a world war two level event times 10
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:49.440]  we're just every revolution moves forward so they can control what they
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:54.800]  believe is the march towards the singularity yes i agree i think that
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:58.400]  we are looking at a coordinated effort on a global basis
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:01.600]  by these elites and as i said i believe that they have
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:04.400]  some extremely smart people that are working with them
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.000]  and what we need to do is come back and use
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.520]  our own intelligence and and the things and the resources that we have
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.960]  as people to counter this craziness that is about to befall us
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:19.600]  i do not believe that anything happens by accident
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.360]  i think that everything is planned i think that we're seeing a tremendous
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:27.120]  amount of organization to bring about the collapse of the western world right
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:30.400]  now uh with the derivatives and with the fed and with
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:34.400]  you know the various other things that are going on uh both of our financial
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.640]  and uh and educational i mean every system every
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:42.160]  every structure is infested with these people at this point
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:45.760]  and it can only bring about disaster i mean they are fooling
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:49.360]  fooling themselves if they don't believe that there are smart people
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:53.600]  who are prepared who have listened who are awake and who are trained
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:57.680]  to be able to take these people to justice because
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.280]  it's not just me there are millions and millions of people
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:05.280]  just as awake and just as prepared to do what needs to be done
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:08.720]  in order to arrest these people and bring them to justice
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:12.320]  in a nuremberg type of situation because that's what's going to be required i
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:16.880]  don't want to see violence i just want justice well exactly and they're not
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:20.480]  going to stop pushing people say oh alex just go along to get along
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.720]  it'll be okay no i wouldn't be risking my life and all this and being this
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:27.360]  hardcore and this this this out in the open
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:30.960]  uh and risking my life if i didn't realize there's no future if we don't
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:34.960]  beat them i mean it's a no brainer you've got to resist these people 110
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:38.480]  percent because where they're taking us is what we should be scared of
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:41.360]  we should be scared of not standing up against them
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.960]  well that's exactly right i think that anyone who's ever stood up against a
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:48.160]  schoolyard bully recognizes that there are cowards
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:52.320]  beneath and all you have to do is stand up to them
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.240]  and once you do they will shrink away like violets in the sun
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.400]  and it's it's not difficult it's not hard and you're exactly right the thing
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:04.560]  that that i fear is that we will not be successful
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:08.640]  it's not about the people themselves and you know the the people that we face
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:11.840]  that are i see as the arch enemy of humanity
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:15.280]  i think that the failure of us to resist them
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:19.200]  is the thing that we should fear the most and they've done an excellent job
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:22.560]  i mean they have put this plan in place for a long long time
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:25.680]  you know they've they've really thought of just about everything
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:29.680]  but what they don't understand and what they can't understand
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:33.280]  is the human soul they don't understand our capacity
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:38.160]  to be human and dr davis stay there back in 60 seconds in the third hour to talk
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:43.280]  about the soul
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:50.480]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:54.080]  hi folks how much jones here was some important information i want to tell you
[01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:57.200]  about matt redhawk and his team of patriots over at my
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:00.800]  patriot supply several years ago matt was sitting in his two-bedroom
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.600]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:06.560]  and the charlington's willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:11.040]  deciding to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:15.040]  my patriot supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:19.520]  they now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:22.720]  working american men and women it is rare to find companies who
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:26.560]  practice what they preach and that's why i stock my pantry with

[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.680]  and powerful information a little bit of buzz on his line via skype but it's
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:44.480]  still great technology talking about the soul
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:50.000]  the bible says in the end days the the the the alchemist to the earth the
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.360]  priest of the new world order will trade in the men's
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:58.480]  souls and that's the essence of what they want but they always end up failing
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:02.560]  because as you said they centralized control and even a psychopath
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:08.160]  uh or just a very evil mercenary someone who doesn't care about others
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:10.880]  even though they consciously are willing to do these bad things and
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:15.360]  subconsciously are evil as well there's still areas of humanity in them and
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.040]  that's why a nero or others end up usually committing suicide
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:21.440]  after they've done a whole bunch of horrible stuff to people because it's
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:25.120]  something else nasty they can do and i've read a lot of literature by top
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:28.960]  globalists who say they might just blow the earth up to keep on willing and
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:32.880]  as a beautiful monument uh in their words to their work
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:35.840]  uh so some of them are so evil they even get that but
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:38.960]  i think a lot of it is they sabotage themselves
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:42.960]  once they get to the pinnacle of power the only problem is now they have such
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:47.040]  high-tech weapons they might sabotage everything else in the process
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:50.880]  doctor closing comments on that well i think you're exactly right and i think
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:55.120]  that it's up to us as people to try and project our humanity
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:58.800]  now more than ever because that's really going to be
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:02.320]  the ultimate weapon here this is a spiritual battle and we need to
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:07.200]  demonstrate our humanity we need to put aside our our minor bickering
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:10.080]  among ourselves we need to come closer together with our
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:14.000]  family and our friends and our neighbors in order to prepare
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.280]  for whatever it is that these people have in store for us
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:20.640]  which isn't going to be good i mean this is not going to work out well
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:24.000]  for us in the short term or for them in the long term
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.200]  but it's going to be us taking the most powerful thing we have
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.440]  which is our humanity our love all of our gifts as people
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.920]  and utilizing our intelligence and our creativity in order to overcome
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:40.480]  the things that they're planning for us in this world takeover in this chaos
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:45.040]  this order out of chaos if you will and i think that that we have the tools
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:48.560]  innately as people and all we have to do is work together
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:52.320]  coordinate identify our strengths and look at our weaknesses
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:56.480]  and overcome the the the game that's been played
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:01.520]  and that's why exactly they're racing to bring an automated autonomous robots
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:04.960]  drones submarine ships they want to replace humans
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:09.440]  so incredibly bad as quickly as possible china france are moving with
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:12.160]  government funding to replace humans they're
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:15.280]  they're having huge losses to do it because this is the end game
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:18.960]  i want to have you back in the very near future
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:21.760]  doctor separately i saw on one of your medical sites
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:25.040]  and we'll get you on about this in the future but an example of all the medical
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:27.120]  stuff that's been developed that gets shelved
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:30.560]  like a virus killing technology you've developed
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:34.000]  well that would be something we'd love to talk about uh we're actually very
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.680]  excited working with uh a group within the defense
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:40.880]  department right now on something that's quite amazing
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:44.480]  and uh but we can talk about that a little bit later next time but tell us a
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:47.920]  little bit about it yeah well if you could imagine
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.080]  a technology that could be provided to
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:55.760]  you know people not just troops but the average population if there was an
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:59.680]  exposure to a lot of the weaponized viruses that are currently being looked
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:04.160]  at you know whether it's Ebola or venezuelan encephalitis or i mean you
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.960]  can go on and on there there's a lot of different things out there that are
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:10.720]  very very bad uh have huge kill rates and if
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:14.480]  there was a single is a single uh drug that is
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:17.920]  essentially a natural product that doesn't have uh you know horrible side
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:20.800]  effects etc that could be provided to people
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:24.480]  this would take an entire weapon system right off the table
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:27.840]  and those are the kind of things that that i and others are working on
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:32.160]  to try and provide solutions i mean there are significant solutions not just in
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:35.840]  medicine but in in energy and all kinds of things in
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:39.680]  transportation and a lot of this information has been suppressed over
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:41.760]  time we're going to have you back on about this
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:45.840]  ogenex.com dr rick davis md an amazing individual thank you

[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:22.240]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:38.000]  here's a ron paul video an article up on info wars.com that's so important
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.440]  congress defers the president on nsa reform
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:50.000]  and that is a report dealing with the fact that congress with all this coming
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.800]  out is going to let obama whitewash everything and quote decide
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:59.040]  what can be done with the nsa and what can't be when it just means business as
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:03.520]  usual total criminal surveillance the american people
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.920]  and there's an excellent article i want to get into a little bit that says when
[02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:11.360]  did america turn into the soviet union we're going to tie that into
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:14.560]  the corruption of chris christie and where all that's going
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:17.360]  coming up but right now let's move quickly i'll try to shut up just get to
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:22.240]  your call move on to the next person a bunch of nuclear power plant workers
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:25.440]  navy people that worked around reactors you name it have called in
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:32.080]  krank and dav and joe and jerry and chris i'm going to go to those
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:36.400]  callers on the topic of increased radiation and why 20 years ago 30 years
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:39.920]  ago they said you know they shut down a beach that had 200 times
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:43.920]  or 200 higher levels of radiation investigated now they go i go yeah it
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:48.560]  is increased radiation a thousand percent but big deal
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:51.920]  we're not going to investigate it we're talking about that attitude this is
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:55.760]  bigger than the radiation and we've gotten local newspapers to cover it talk
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:59.200]  radio to cover it but it's just it's like so many other things i mean
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:02.720]  we need to just admit this is going on it's like the solution
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.560]  to things is admitting it's happening like the question why did america
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:10.480]  or when did america turn into the soviet union
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:14.720]  i mean we are becoming in many ways we're already worse but they're still
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:18.400]  vestigial islands of second amendment family private property
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:23.520]  but quickly that's being eroded the water's rising
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:28.960]  and i mean it's just horrible watching this country die like this
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:32.240]  and then so many people are immune to be to worrying
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:35.520]  and they're the ones that think that's an attribute
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:40.640]  it's like they don't have nerve endings so to use the fire ant analogy again
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:43.760]  they're sitting in a pile of fire ants you're sitting there with them
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:46.640]  and you're trying to get up you're tied down by the government of bureaucracy
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:49.520]  you're like oh fire ants oh they're killing us i'll get them off
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:53.440]  you know it's even worse they're not tied down you're tied down sitting in
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:57.440]  fire ants they're not tied down but they're paralyzed
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:00.960]  when it comes to feeling they can move but they don't have any
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:05.360]  any feeling they're numb and you're like can't you see the fire ants
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:07.840]  climb in it you can't you see all the red spots
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:10.880]  fire ants kill people they're all over you you could wipe them off and then
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:14.800]  untie me and they're like so what yeah i see them
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:18.560]  but i like having red spots and they're my little friends
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:21.840]  and i'm like no no they're bad they're bad you you want to get them off of you
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:26.400]  and i just come up with these crude analogies but that's how i feel
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:32.160]  and then i study the people running things and they are so bad
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:36.160]  and it's scary people say well why are you trying to scare us then
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:40.960]  i'm not trying to scare you this is ongoing admitting it means we can turn
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:45.040]  it around and i everybody's in panic mode
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:48.240]  right now over one thing or another and then they'll project it on to their
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:52.240]  families or work or i mean the numbers are there
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:55.840]  people are freaking out because they know things aren't right
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:59.440]  and the government says that's al-qaeda give your rights up you're afraid because
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:02.160]  of al-qaeda no no you're afraid of the subconscious
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:05.680]  spiritual level because you know big stuff's about to happen and man i'm
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:09.280]  telling you everybody can feel it big stuff's
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:12.560]  already happening if you're in countries where the global is
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:16.720]  turn the food and water off and 30 million star for death a year
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:20.880]  let me tell you you know i'm just gonna go your phone calls it's just
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:25.360]  it's so crazy the stuff that's gearing up between china and japan threatening to
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:28.400]  attack each other again and china just came out and said we're
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:31.840]  going to invade that island prepare for invasion in the news
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:35.680]  they're telling chinese prepare for invasion
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:40.000]  i mean it's on folks and this isn't even a news item
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:44.560]  i'll guarantee you if i went to a
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:48.160]  rotary club or something or if i went to where supposedly the
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:52.640]  crème de la crème of central texas are i would walk into those meetings
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:56.640]  and they would be talking about how to make money but not even really how to
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:59.040]  make money it'd be how to make money within an establishment system that's
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.480]  a con they would be giving me the latest hype on that and
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:06.000]  they want to talk about football and they want to talk about
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.160]  how many women they slept with and they want to and i'm like okay listen
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:14.000]  listen that you understand this is all a wool
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.920]  pulled over your eyes to blind you from the real world
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:23.200]  that's going downhill very very quickly and once this stuff starts kicking off
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:25.920]  you're not going to be able to put it back in the bottle
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:30.160]  okay so we're at the edge of a cliff right now i could spiritually feel it
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:33.360]  and i don't know if it's gonna be a bio attack super bugs
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:40.000]  total collapse war oh man i just it's beyond chills now
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:45.920]  it's it's it's not being able to stop it
[02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:49.200]  the mental illness that is spreading everywhere
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:53.280]  the paranoia that is spreading everywhere
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:14:01.200]  again of stuff that isn't even a threat and people are like that because deep
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:04.080]  down they know they're in a crisis but they don't know the roadmap they don't
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:07.440]  know why they're in a crisis like the media tells them we're not in a
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:09.760]  depression the economy's great everything's wonderful
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:14.400]  but they know it's not and i think that's it there's a crisis of confidence
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:17.840]  that people know the system's lying now but they don't know exactly about what
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:24.560]  they just know it's all bull all right let's go to your calls
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:28.240]  frank and michigan thanks for holding and calling you say that your
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:32.560]  treatment plant worker on radiation well go ahead
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:37.200]  hello how are you doing alex i'm not actually doing too good
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:41.920]  well uh hopefully i can give you some information i i i work for a government
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:45.600]  agency a local government agency i've been a wastewater treatment plant
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:51.120]  operator for about 11 years now and i know quite a bit about this stuff
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:56.480]  and i work in michigan uh we you know we have the great lakes and all the
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:59.840]  inland lakes and the streams and everything so we're pretty protective
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:06.560]  of our of our water um we uh have about the same
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:10.880]  stringent um regulations as california does
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:17.200]  and um i'm talking to you as an insider uh giving you some
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:20.400]  information and um kind of put my job on the
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:24.240]  line for this but i'm going to tell you some stuff that um i think it's very
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:29.840]  important for uh the community over there in california
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:35.120]  um every community uh has a wastewater treatment plant
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:38.880]  and uh there are two types there's a groundwater
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:42.960]  discharge and the surface water discharge um
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:51.360]  now these are EPA regulated but um they don't test for radiation
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:58.640]  they just do basic tests and you know if you uh if you're okay with your
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:01.760]  ammonia and your nitrates and your phosphorus you're
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:07.760]  you're good to go um but what what i've been looking at with
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:11.360]  the radiation and and you know i'm putting two and two together with this
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:14.880]  and this is something i think the residents of california really need to
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:20.800]  understand that the older cities um have degrading
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:26.160]  infrastructures um and what i mean by that is uh
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:30.560]  there's groundwater infiltration there's surface water you're saying right on
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:35.600]  and and other natural radiation uh is now because the pipes are all rotting
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:38.880]  and and and uh that it's leaching out you're
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:43.520]  you're thinking it's natural or what's the inside info no no no i i i'm saying
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:49.840]  you have to look at the rain getting into uh getting because a lot of these
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:53.680]  uh wastewater treatment plants are storm water
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:58.080]  and sanitary combined which means that if
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:02.320]  it rains and it gets into the storm water system
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:07.600]  where's that rain coming from it's leaching into and being combined with
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:11.600]  the with the wastewater that you have to treat
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:15.040]  so where does that end up it ends up being
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:19.120]  either in the groundwater as the the undisturbed
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:23.520]  or surface water so you're saying that it's probably rain from Fukushima and
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:26.400]  other things coming down then running out to the ocean
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:33.360]  and that's why uh is radioactive well i i i'm thinking that it's it's
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:37.440]  contributing to what people are drinking
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:44.400]  and i think that um because this because the wastewater discharge
[02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:51.360]  goes into like i said a stream or a um uh or groundwater
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:56.880]  um and uh water treatment plants also have degrading pipes
[02:17:56.880 --> 02:18:02.640]  so they also are receiving this the stuff so very interesting but what's the
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:06.000]  bottom line i mean i don't think you can get in trouble for this as a citizen
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.120]  giving your perspective on something happening on the west coast
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:11.920]  it's like folks ask me if they can have permission to put my bumper stickers on
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:14.160]  their car you don't have to ask permission that's the whole point
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:17.200]  uh but i mean specifically i mean it's interesting what you're saying but what's
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:19.840]  the what's the what's the kernel what's the key
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:23.600]  of what you want us to get from what you're saying is i think that uh
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:27.920]  jacari while he's out there he needs to test
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:33.920]  um he needs to go to local local he he needs to go to local wastewater
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:38.080]  treatment plants and and see what the results are
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:42.640]  and see if he can and now this is all public so we should be able to
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:48.400]  to grab um a sample and test it for radiation that's a great idea in fact
[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:51.040]  they did they did test of wastewater plants in central texas
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:54.880]  and found higher radiation levels a few years ago mainly because the fluoride
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:18:58.240]  they're getting from china has radioactive isotopes in it
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:01.520]  but also some of the groundwater the aquifer that's a great that's an idea
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:04.880]  we should send them to water treatment plants because that's a
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:07.760]  place that you're saying it's going to be concentrating
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.280]  into those areas is that what you're saying and so that's a good yeah and
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:14.720]  that's going to affect the whole public as a whole i mean and and these
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:21.600]  concentrated areas they're people have no clue
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:24.240]  oh i get it you're saying you don't want to tell us that
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:27.120]  there's high radiation at the water treatment plants i've actually read
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:29.440]  that and seen that because it precipitates out
[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:32.640]  into the pipes and the linings at the facilities
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:36.160]  and that's why they found it at wastewater plants in texas that's cbs news
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:41.200]  is that what you're getting at sir yes exactly and and and the reason why i'm
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:46.320]  saying this and and you know this other thing kind of i i saw a
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:50.320]  boy of you wrote a little while ago that um

[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:24.400]  we're gonna get a quick pop in at the start of the next segment from
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:26.960]  california as our team now goes south to get
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:31.680]  radiation readings and then i'm gonna shift gears and into all this news
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:35.200]  there's an article up on info wars.com
[02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:39.040]  that really makes me sad because i read what the guy wrote and i can tell he
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:43.520]  means well and it also shows how the system
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:49.040]  uses good people to carry out evil in fact i don't even want to get this
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:55.120]  sheriff's deputy kicked off the force
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:02.240]  but it does illustrate the hubris and the arrogance and so he needs to be
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:08.240]  he probably needs to be because it needs to be an example to others
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:11.120]  future sheriff he's in a cadet right now a military veteran
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:14.960]  says protesters should be exterminated in gas chambers
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:20.480]  i would beat your effing bleep just for the sheer joy of it
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:24.400]  when you read what he says he thinks he's doing good
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:28.960]  and actually says some good things and it just shows how whacked out all this
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:32.080]  is we're not just dealing with evil people folks
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:37.280]  we're dealing with very dangerous very very dangerous
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:44.400]  people who mean well but are not centered or not old enough
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:50.320]  to understand how things fit together that even if you don't like what some
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:54.880]  protesters saying to you insulting you you don't beat them over the head
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:57.920]  and destroy their first amendment because your first amendment
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:03.840]  is important as well and that when you violate somebody's rights
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:09.040]  you are destroying the very fabric of society
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:13.440]  and again folks i'm not putting on an actor on air right now
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:17.440]  the dread that i've got and i've been having it the last few months and i'm
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:20.400]  talking everybody else has it and i'm really freaked out i don't know what's
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:26.000]  about to happen but it's bad folks and it's it's a feeling of
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.800]  the analogies like knowing one of your kids gonna die
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:32.640]  and but not knowing who it is and not being able to stop it
[02:26:32.640 --> 02:26:36.320]  and then just seeing these childlike people all around me
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:40.080]  i'm not on a power trip i don't think of myself as smarter than people
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:42.960]  why do i know all this stuff and other people don't see it
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:50.720]  it's all right there 98% of what we talk about it's all on record
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.920]  i mean this is like saying you don't want the city to blow up or something
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:58.160]  it's it's not hard i don't want world government
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:03.280]  i don't want nuclear war i don't want bio weapons released on me
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:10.000]  i want prosperity and to build stuff and i see society taken over by a bunch of
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.920]  crooks with fancy propaganda with a bunch of
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:16.800]  good people working for them and i'm sick of it
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:20.480]  i hate my job i'm gonna be honest with you i like exposing evil i have fun in
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.000]  it doing sometimes i used to
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:27.440]  now i like to fight evil and i'm more effective at it but it's still it's
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:31.520]  sickening to have to look at these people and study them i think
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:35.680]  i think that's what i'm whining about here today
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:39.760]  is that i don't want to look at the new world order and study all their
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:42.160]  ugliness i want to look at the stars and the
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:45.360]  moon and the fish and play with my children and be happy and be around
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:48.800]  nice people but every time i am around them
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:53.680]  i get beyond upset and want to protect them because i realize
[02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:57.840]  that i'm in denial that i can even take time out to live
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:01.360]  because the enemy is coming down on us ladies and gentlemen
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:03.760]  and so i've got to learn everything about the enemy i got to focus on
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:08.880]  everything they're doing i got to get inside their heads which is horrible
[02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:12.560]  because when you're inside their their heads you see all their their gang signs
[02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:15.920]  everywhere their symbols their celebrations over us
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.800]  their their victory arches their their power their predatory system you just
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:23.520]  see and you and you read them bragging and
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:28.480]  their open criminals and their gross and they're the worst of humanity in
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:32.800]  control because the good in humanity does not crave
[02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:36.800]  power only the evil and so now they're in
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:40.800]  charge and then when you have knowledge of evil you then see the evil in you
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:43.600]  and even though it's nothing compared to these people
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:48.320]  i am just incredibly guilty i'm guilty of thoughts i have that the average man
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:52.720]  would think of and think that's nothing but i realize where it goes and what it
[02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:56.800]  does and i realize it's the little sins of the heart
[02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:00.240]  that in the final equation add to everything but i'm a fleshly person
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:03.760]  i can't stop being who i am
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:09.840]  it is it is it is only through god that we can find fulfillment
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:14.560]  and i put it all on god and i i put all of these issues on god's
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:17.520]  plate and just say i'm trying as hard as i can
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:22.080]  you gotta help me be strong and we gotta help everybody else to be strong
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:26.160]  because even jesus wept when he knew what he was
[02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:29.760]  going to go through the next day and i'm not worried about what i've got to go
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:32.800]  through that's almost a cop out and easy
[02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:36.720]  i'm worried about everybody all the kids they're putting on deadly drugs in the
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:39.680]  schools all the gmo all the diseases all the
[02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:44.400]  little kids dying in cancer centers all the things they're doing i feel it
[02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:48.000]  love is no stranger to me i'm the opposite of a psychopath and it hurts
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:53.920]  really bad we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:53.920 --> 02:30:01.200]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:05.600]  the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic
[02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:09.440]  members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive
[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:12.720]  ability of the american people so why are the social
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:16.640]  engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host
[02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:20.240]  population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:23.680]  we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:27.440]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies i am extremely excited to
[02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:30.400]  announce the exclusive info wars life fluoride

[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:48.880]  brian and dav uh oh wait i want to talk to davin california
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:52.000]  he says uh workers are ordering iodine in government
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.960]  i've got to get to those i've got to get to the other news i may have to go into
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:58.720]  overdrive um
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:03.760]  i wish every day this stuff wasn't true but you don't have to believe me
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:08.480]  to go out and see that it's true you can look around you and see it all
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:12.160]  unfolding and we see the tactics of the system
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:16.800]  saying dead crews ran paul alex jones you know they're all discredited that
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:20.640]  you know they said the health care law was a scam
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:25.760]  but we were we were proven right but see they play that mind game of saying no
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:29.600]  you're discredited hoping weak-minded people buy into that
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:34.720]  and that doesn't work anymore i've seen different media people
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:38.160]  who i've met or talked to over the years will say oh
[02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:44.320]  privately alex jones told me this is all fake and there's no new world order
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:48.160]  when i was on the bbc in fact i even have this on that white iphone we ought to
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:51.200]  put that out because i kept it rolling after the show and then i never even
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:54.960]  thought to counter that and i confronted bill de berg group member when
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:58.880]  i first walked in he was leaving the set i did get that on tape put that out
[02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:02.960]  i get in they were trying to cut me off so i just took over
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:06.640]  and then when they come back from break they go mr jones said it was all fake
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:12.160]  during the break total slander total libel total defamation
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:15.840]  total fraud but that's a tactic and i'm saying
[02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:21.360]  that's how they totally use a line a well-known individual that made a film
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:25.280]  that you know kind of promotes a new world order view as the solution
[02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:30.480]  who put me in without asking years ago said in a big conference on tv a few
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:34.720]  weeks ago i saw the video i might play it just to show the evidence of a lie
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:37.120]  not to defend myself because i don't need to be defended
[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:43.840]  just to show how this tactic is used he um he said i i i talked to some of the
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:46.880]  those alex jones really good he even fenced the lie
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:50.400]  and alex admitted that there's no new world order no global government none
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:54.320]  of this is true and it's all a lie
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:58.560]  well the new world order is all being announced around us but see
[02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:02.800]  that's the mind game oh alex says it isn't real
[02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:06.320]  he betrayed all of you
[02:36:06.880 --> 02:36:10.480]  doesn't matter what they do to me or how they set me up or what stuff they make
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:12.960]  up because the devil's coming against me from a hundred
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:15.680]  different angles right now believe me it's amazing
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:18.720]  and i found strength in the whole thing and and found a higher level of
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:24.640]  understanding throughout it but i am sad for those type of people
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:28.080]  that use lies against folks and then bear false witness
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:32.480]  and say that an honorable totally truthful person is a fraud
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:36.400]  when they themselves are frauds that's what's disgusting about this world
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:40.160]  they say they're liberals when they're the opposite of liberals
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:44.880]  but that's all they can do and i realized that i'm so close to this evil
[02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:48.160]  that even when i went off the set and they had security throwing us out
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:51.840]  and then i later went back that night and you know saw the youtube of it on bbc
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:56.960]  when i came back saying that was all an act he admits it's all fake
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.240]  total lie said no such thing
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:09.920]  that what must it be like to literally pray on your audience i know it's so
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:14.000]  easy for these people to pray on people
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.920]  that's what i don't like i don't like praying on innocent people and lying to
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:20.880]  them i will tell you just like i like
[02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:23.920]  lancing a puss if it's in my big toe with an integral toenail
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:28.160]  i like it when a bully starts a fight with me
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:31.840]  and and and they make the first move and i start
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:36.800]  showing them who you know how the cow ate the cabbage
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:40.160]  but it's not because i like beating somebody up i like
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:46.320]  bad people being shown justice
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:52.080]  and i'm sick of evil people i'm sick of them
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:57.600]  and they've got to be dealt with and faced head on no more playing games folks
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:02.320]  i think about the level of crap we put up with the on record they put florida in
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:06.480]  the soviet union in the 30s and hitler picked it up from stalin when they had
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:11.760]  a pact with him the russian-german and a
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:17.440]  nazi deal from what 1941 when they went into poland
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:20.080]  1940
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:25.840]  i don't know why i digress off of that i got so much to cover
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:30.160]  and then they they put it in our water and it's on record giving us cancer and
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:33.200]  dumbing us down and makes your teeth brittle
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:36.400]  and the american medical association american dental association say don't
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:40.480]  don't rush with it and no one even knows that
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:44.400]  we even forced them to stop promoting it but it's still there
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:49.760]  and that's just one example they put roach poison in the water
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:54.320]  and then they think it's funny the mayor of austin is assaulting me and my
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:58.880]  family he thinks it's funny and i sit here and put up
[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:03.600]  with it i'm sick of it had enough of it just just
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:06.640]  right there just on that front alone right there
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:10.960]  they they literally hiked their leg and and you and you know what right in our
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:14.000]  face every day and let me tell you something
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.280]  everybody out there if you keep putting up with all this
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:20.560]  if you keep going along with the system and laying down to it
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:24.400]  you deserve what you get but i'm here to tell you
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:27.680]  i don't like this stuff that's going on and i'm not perfect i don't have all the
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:30.560]  answers but i know you don't just throw your arms up
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:34.000]  and just let a bunch of crooks run wild the fbi announced last week
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:37.040]  they're not even going to do white collar investigations anymore unless
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:40.880]  they're politically directed to do so because the crooks run the asylum
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:44.320]  folks the inmates run the prison
[02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:47.840]  and you know what happens when they finally get full control
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:51.920]  all hades breaks loose and they've taken
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:55.440]  hundreds of thousands of military personnel the ones that
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:00.400]  aren't that smart the ones that are screwed up in many cases
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:04.400]  and they're putting them as police who literally see the public as an enemy and
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:09.040]  who talk about how they want to kill us if we look at them wrong
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:14.160]  hey why don't you guys go fight al qaeda the government runs in iraq right now
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:16.800]  and by the way most the troops are the best people you'll ever find
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:21.760]  they find the bad apples and promote them into these departments and into these
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:24.800]  federal agencies now some departments that aren't evil
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:30.640]  they try to find boy scout good guys honest to goodness tough guys but most
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:33.760]  the time you got a bunch of social workers and a bunch of control freaks
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:38.240]  and a bunch of soldiers who aren't real soldiers who want to go around
[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:42.000]  pushing unarmed people around and getting the face of protesters
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.600]  and intimidating people let me tell you something you don't intimidate me
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:50.320]  every instinct i've got tells me you're a tyrant wannabe and my enemy
[02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:54.240]  and you morons once the civil war starts really think there aren't going to be a
[02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:57.440]  bunch of people that come down on you like a ton of bricks
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:01.280]  you think you're the tip of the spear you're going to get bent back real fast
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:05.200]  there are so many hardcore serious people who don't want to go completely
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:08.400]  wild but they're ready and they've got names they got
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:12.080]  list folks and i don't even have to talk to people to know that
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:17.120]  i don't want 300 400 000 cops to die in a week
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:21.440]  i don't want hundreds of thousands of us military personnel to die in weeks it
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:25.520]  will happen if this civil war starts and i think deep down
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:28.880]  that's probably what it is obama's gonna false flag
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:32.400]  and blaming on patriot groups and start roundups and then people are gonna
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:37.280]  start killing whoever comes in the roundup and it's on folks
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:40.240]  that's why i just went there that's why i'm not even going to our reporters
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:42.240]  right now and i haven't gone to the calls in the news
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:46.640]  because i have this deep feeling of dread and i i could see all of it and
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:49.440]  they're clearly getting ready to start a civil war in this country
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:52.720]  that's on the table war with china is on the table
[02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:57.040]  financial collapse is on the table super bugs are on the table and it's all
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:01.200]  coming together and it's not just me it's every anthropologist sociologist
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:05.600]  civilization a technician it's everyone that studies this
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:09.760]  anyone who has a serious mind every gauge says red
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:14.320]  level danger will robinson and the public picks it up at a subconscious
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:16.960]  level the public's going crazy right now you can
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:20.640]  the anxiety the divorces the problems the weirdness
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:23.680]  every executive i talk to that manages large groups of people says they've
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:28.000]  never seen such craziness we're in a societal crisis and it's just
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.640]  the beginning so i don't know exactly what it's
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:34.560]  going to be but i know what's coming at us and man my whole body is just like
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:38.480]  yeah just get ready for it
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:42.320]  and i wish the general public could get ready for it and affect the against the
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:44.640]  enemy because your instincts are ready to fight this
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:48.000]  but your instincts aren't aren't aren't aren't conscious so they don't know
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.360]  what to direct it at the cops are all freaked out
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:54.000]  they're directing it to public the public's all freaked out they're
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.240]  directing it at the government when the government itself is just a
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:02.400]  level of the globalist control grid it's the rubber on the tire
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:06.240]  or the tread on the tank it's not the enemy i don't hate the tread of a tank
[02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:09.680]  i don't hate a cop who's misguided
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:14.880]  i don't like the brain in there the computer program running the tank i
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:19.120]  don't want to go chew on the treads of the tank and break my teeth off
[02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:22.480]  but that's what's going to happen and they've got all that planned out
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:25.520]  and let me tell you they're crazy enough folks to start a civil war in this
[02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:27.760]  country the number one thing we better be worried
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:31.680]  about is that i'm telling you as a smoke screen for the financial collapse
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:35.120]  then the war because oh anybody that's fighting the government after
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:38.080]  the chinese attacked that island they probably got to deal with them so i'm
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:41.280]  really giving you what i battle plans i think they're up to
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:46.400]  seeing all the pieces start a civil war with false flags
[02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:49.920]  blame the financial collapse and derivatives going upside down a total
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:54.960]  federal reserve takeover of everything on the civil war causing the collapse
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:58.160]  then start a war with an outside group so you can say
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:01.440]  we're under attack the chinese just sunk three of our carriers
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:03.520]  but we're not going to respond with the nukes and they're not going to respond
[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:08.000]  with nukes it'll all be staged i'm serious this is how they'll do it
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.040]  probably giving you their actual battle plan right now
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:14.640]  just going out into the ether and all the data and pulling it out
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:17.840]  then oh my gosh you can't resist these people that are resisting they're
[02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:22.160]  helping the chinese defeat our troops images of sinking aircraft carriers
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:25.200]  the public will then go under mind control and say yes
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:29.280]  we've got to root out the domestic group they're with the chinese or they're
[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:33.840]  with al-qaeda i'm telling you that's the plan right there
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:37.040]  through the crisis today of just days of racking my mind
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:39.600]  about what they're going to do i think that's a prime battle plan that you just
[02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:43.280]  heard because again top generals in history can look at the other enemy and
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:45.600]  know them well enough to know what move they're going to make
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:48.560]  and then you're able to be ready to counter that and i'm telling you folks
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:52.640]  i have immersed myself in this like no one else probably
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:57.840]  and that is one of their main plans that you just heard on air
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:03.200]  that plan you just heard that is what they're lining up to do
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.480]  you notice years ago we told you before the financial collapse they would bring
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:08.560]  all this into place i want to go to our reporters now
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:12.480]  well obviously do some overdrive here we're going to
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:15.760]  go to jacari jackson who's outside the golden gate bridge it looks like he's on
[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:18.720]  the city side he's going to give us the radiation readings
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:21.600]  and tell us where he's going next we're also going to send him to some water
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:24.800]  treatment plants because we just had a texture remind me
[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:27.760]  that water treatment plants is where the radiation
[02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:31.600]  precipitates out because it it condenses there
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:36.640]  or the word would be dehydrates there basically
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:39.600]  to concentrate of it that's a that's a good tip they're going to go on down
[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:42.160]  to southern california but jacari jackson thank you for
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:45.760]  joining us today sir thanks for having us alex we're out here
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:49.360]  like you said right outside the golden gate bridge we're continuing our tour
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:52.720]  we've gone as far north as portland organ now we're back down here in san
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:56.640]  francisco because just a little bit south of here we had some very high levels
[02:45:56.640 --> 02:46:00.640]  of radiation at half moon bay at surfers beach we found radiation levels in
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:03.680]  excess of 10 times of what's considered normal for that
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:07.280]  location so we came up here it's not too far so we want to warn these people
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:10.000]  out here and we'll do that right after this broadcast
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:14.720]  well good job what other intel do you have well we've been out here alex we
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:18.400]  came with our geiger counter using the cpms the counts per minute
[02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:22.720]  and we found about 62 counts per minute now south of here at half moon bay
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:26.720]  they say the normal cpms accounts per minute is around 30 so we're heading
[02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:31.760]  about double of what's considered normal just a little bit south
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:36.000]  jacari that's good news and bad news i guess
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:41.280]  and i guess still no word with the city and the county there about why there's
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:45.760]  1000 higher in readings you got 1400 in other readings
[02:46:45.760 --> 02:46:49.520]  they've confirmed it's much higher any word on that
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:52.640]  well just like you said alex there there's the good news and the bad news
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:56.640]  the good news is that in our travels the concentration the highest concentration
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:00.000]  of radiation seems to be centered around the half moon bay area of course
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:03.280]  not good news for those people who live in that location but good news for
[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:07.040]  everybody else but we still see high levels of radiation higher levels of
[02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:10.960]  radiation double going up going up north and also to the south of here
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:14.560]  but people are still they're debating they say it may be naturally occurring
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:17.280]  the radiation from things such as thorium but i definitely do not want to
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:20.080]  discount that it could be fukushima radiation
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:23.040]  sure and there are a lot of earthquakes there and that releases a lot of the
[02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:26.080]  thorium and radium and radon and the rest of it
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:29.760]  the the issue is is that it's increasing from what it was in the past
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:33.520]  and you've got fukushima undoubtedly doing this and you've had to cover up
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:36.240]  there so that's why we're trying to cover this we've only seen a few
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:39.200]  newspapers cover it and they've tried to
[02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:42.880]  rebuff us or but then they admit that we're right
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:46.080]  they just say that it's basically bad that we even care
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:49.440]  that's pretty much the gist of it and like i said yesterday on the show with
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:52.560]  anthony gutiarty some people are convinced that it's global warming for
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:55.760]  whatever reason just uh many different theories and
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:00.320]  uh ideas as to what could be causing this high level of radiation
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:04.080]  i'm wondering if a kaiju is it is to blame and if it's about to come out of
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:06.720]  the ocean over there in a tactical lingate bridge
[02:48:06.720 --> 02:48:10.560]  i'm not exactly sure that that's one one theory that i wouldn't be surprised
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:13.840]  to hear out here alex you know jacar you said you've been to southern california
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:17.280]  before visiting family but you've never been to northern california memory
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:20.560]  serves how beautiful is central and northern california
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:23.200]  well i'll tell you alex you guys were telling us when we were getting prepped
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:26.800]  for this mission that it was a very beautiful drive it is very much that
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:30.240]  it does concern me that you know the bio accumulation could rise in those
[02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:33.840]  areas of the radiation and we could get more radiation in those areas but
[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:37.120]  just on the outskirts if you drove by it it's just some of the most beautiful
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:40.640]  scenery even out here in beautiful san francisco i don't know if the guys can
[02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:43.680]  get a shot of alcatraz over there oh yeah you're right there on the
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:47.520]  city side right by the presidio right that's right it's a it's a great
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:51.040]  location alex we're very happy to be here uh we are a little concerned about the
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:54.320]  radiation sometimes i think i might be safer out there on alcatraz
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:57.440]  than out there in half moon bay but you know we're going to continue on the
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:00.560]  mission and when we get back we're just going to bathe and some iodine and we're
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:04.080]  going to keep going because we want all our info warriors and other people to
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:06.640]  know what's going out here so they can come out here with their own geiger
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:09.920]  counters and do their own test absolutely and you heard some of the
[02:49:09.920 --> 02:49:12.640]  radiologists earlier they said wearing clothes is a big part because these
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:16.320]  particles are right to your body uh obviously being around the area was a
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:20.000]  thousand percent higher than it should be probably isn't great but
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.480]  they said when you fly in an airplane you could probably get more radiation than
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:25.840]  that but certainly i wouldn't be snorting any of the sand off the beach
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:29.840]  there at half moon bay jacari no i wouldn't and you know as you mentioned
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:32.880]  that we talked to some people going up and down the coast uh just the other
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:36.240]  day when we came back to half moon bay and people said there you know once they
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:38.960]  got this information they stopped walking their dogs out there one guy
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:41.520]  said his boys were swimming out there and he got the news he pulled him out the
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:45.200]  water he's not letting them go back as we talked about yesterday a young lady
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:48.560]  said one of her friends go swimming out there and he's going bald and she
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:52.320]  thinks it's exactly from directly related to surfers beach in the high
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:54.640]  level she was saying in a matter of months it's like
[02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:57.520]  sudden clumps of hair falling off because like i asked i said you know you know
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:01.600]  people go bald but she said no you you don't understand sir he's gone bald
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:04.800]  and he won't stop swimming in there i try to tell him to get out of that water
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:09.120]  but he keeps going back wow so so where are you going
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:12.080]  after this jacar you're gonna go talk to locals then i guess you're starting
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:15.440]  down towards los angeles yes that's right alex we'll go
[02:50:15.440 --> 02:50:19.040]  do a man on the street out right after this broadcast then we'll head
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:22.960]  south to diablo canyon there is a a nuclear facility out there we want to
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:25.680]  test around that location also los angeles so
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:29.520]  hit up some of the sights and scenes out there and just continue down south
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:33.120]  looking for these levels of radiation now like i said we're not always
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:36.080]  encountering high levels which is a good deal but we definitely want to warn the
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:39.120]  people that bioaccumulations could increase and we definitely want people
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:42.240]  to be aware absolutely because even if it's just double in many areas what it
[02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:45.680]  should be uh it shows something's going on there well investigative

[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:06.320]  staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:10.880]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world

[02:53:13.760 --> 02:53:18.160]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:22.160]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:26.160]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results
[02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:31.520]  are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had

[02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:25.440]  we are in the middle of unbelievable wonderment
[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:30.480]  so much good so much beauty so much to protect
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:35.120]  and we've allowed the television and this artificial culture to literally
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:40.160]  program us with anti-human garbage to make us malfunction
[02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:44.560]  so that we can be conquered and then executed
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:47.600]  and never even know we were killed by soft kill weapons
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:51.360]  that are on record being put in our food supply and i don't know how you
[02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:54.640]  counter something like that
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:57.680]  i mean it's like people didn't believe heller was doing what he did for the
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:04.240]  first six seven years he was in power really the first eight nine years
[02:55:04.240 --> 02:55:07.920]  and it's just par for the course historically and we're in the middle of
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:12.240]  this craziness and the average person is so narcissistic
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:15.920]  and so into being cool because of the television the television shows you
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:18.400]  this arrested development the way people act
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:21.840]  and people act like people act on television that's not real
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:25.680]  so you're talking to these programmed people that aren't real
[02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:28.640]  and you can't get through to them because they're delusional they think if they
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:32.160]  just laugh at someone that cares that that gives them power
[02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:35.200]  they're delusional i mean look at this article that i keep saying i'm going to
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:38.640]  cover and i haven't children who watch too much tv may have damaged brain
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:42.480]  structures the more time a child spends watching
[02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:45.920]  tv the more profound the changes it leads to more gray matter in the regions
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:50.720]  and less than others around the frontal polar cortex of the area of the brain
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:53.600]  and it goes into saying it doesn't allow them to differentiate it was a
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:55:58.160]  japanese study looked at 276 children ages five to 18 who watched between zero
[02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:01.520]  and four hours per day with the average being about two hours
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:04.480]  mra brain scans show children who spent the most hours
[02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:07.440]  from the box and greater amounts of gray matter in the regions around the
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:10.960]  frontal cortex in the area of the front of the
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:14.720]  frontal lobe but the increased volume was negative thing and it was linked to
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:19.040]  lower verbal intelligence said the authors from the university
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:24.480]  of the city of sindali they suggested gray matter could be compared to body
[02:56:24.480 --> 02:56:27.680]  weight and said these brain areas needed to be
[02:56:27.680 --> 02:56:31.280]  pruned during childhood in order to operate
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:36.880]  efficiently these areas show developmental cortex thinning during
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:40.400]  development and children with superior IQ show the most
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.800]  vigorous
[02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:47.200]  thinning a cortical in these areas the team wrote
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:51.200]  these areas show developmental thinning during development
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:54.480]  and the children with superior IQs show the most vigorous
[02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:58.960]  thinning in the area the team wrote now again other areas of the brain
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:03.280]  it's better to have more cells but then when you get into the cerebral cortex to
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:08.480]  to layman terms put this it is wired so specifically
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:11.280]  to be able to access all the other areas of the brain
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:14.800]  that when you go on into the study they found you're very good at watching and
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:18.880]  very good at being programmed but it's basically turning
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:23.840]  your frontal lobes that are meant to process and be a traffic cop
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:29.040]  into like the rest of your brain tissue to make it simple
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:33.440]  where they couldn't focus they couldn't make fast decisions they couldn't
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:36.240]  critically think they're really good at watching tv though
[02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:39.520]  you become really good at being a spectator
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:44.640]  really good at being a jellyfish really big at doing nothing
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:47.360]  in other studies and this is not the first of its type
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:51.680]  been around for 60 something years listening to radio
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:58.080]  increases if it's informational news increases IQ increases neuron
[02:57:58.080 --> 02:58:05.280]  connections reading even more why because when i am
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:09.680]  reading and i say blue whale you pull up a blue whale
[02:58:09.680 --> 02:58:12.880]  that makes your cerebral cortex tying into the old
[02:58:12.880 --> 02:58:16.320]  you're tying into your ears everything else in the areas of the brain that have
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:19.600]  memory all those areas then build their muscles
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:24.240]  their fibers their their neuron connections i use muscle as a figurative
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:27.280]  speech not really muscle they all communicate
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:31.200]  okay you understand because it has to go get the data what's a blue whale look
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:34.880]  like but when you're watching tv it's right there
[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:41.440]  you don't have to do that it actually grows the brain different in development

[03:01:41.440 --> 03:01:45.200]  we are what else is on your mind i mean what do you think is really going on
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:48.800]  oh i think it's optimization from the very beginning i had somebody tell me the
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:53.040]  industry the other day we know ten percent and uh what we know scares the
[03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:57.120]  heck out of us so what is the other ninety percent we don't know uh i was
[03:01:57.120 --> 03:02:01.200]  talking to arnie gunterson he said he's got some stuff he's gonna release soon
[03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:04.320]  and of course at that point he couldn't tell me what it was let's get ardie
[03:02:04.320 --> 03:02:07.840]  gunterson on asap guys in fact in fact we're gonna get your number right now
[03:02:07.840 --> 03:02:10.400]  sir and get you ardie gunterson everybody on because
[03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:14.000]  you know my issue is fox news even reports at the university say
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:17.680]  all that radiation is going to start just hitting now over the next four months
[03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:21.360]  in a whole new wave bigger than originally hit and there's no
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:24.560]  coverage so i mean fox did cover it to their
[03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:28.800]  you know credits but it's it's just not the coverage it deserves
[03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:33.280]  well abc really gave it a white watch i stayed up and lost a lot of sleep for
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:37.680]  nothing on the abc nightline show ridiculous
[03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:41.600]  well my issue is this culture of whitewashing everything's got to end
[03:02:41.600 --> 03:02:43.920]  and it doesn't mean we have to run around like chickens with our heads cut off
[03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:47.600]  but everything but i mean china says they're preparing to nuke the u.s
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:53.520]  russia's freaking out uh china says they're set to invade
[03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:58.560]  a filipino island war is going to start if that happens and the chinese aren't
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:01.520]  known for saying they're going to do something not doing it i mean i've
[03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:05.200]  talked to top political scientists military people that study the chai
[03:03:05.200 --> 03:03:08.800]  comms this is really bad they don't openly go around
[03:03:08.800 --> 03:03:12.080]  threatening people and the word is it's not bluster they'll
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:15.680]  probably do it so i mean it's just craziness
[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:19.600]  it's craziness what do you think is going on
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:23.840]  i think it's craziness i think like the doctor said there's a
[03:03:23.840 --> 03:03:29.440]  large group that has an agenda and if it's building on fault lines or in
[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:34.240]  its uh getting china worked up to go after the philippines
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:40.000]  it's all on the on the list oh man and the elite have spent more in the
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:43.200]  u.s than all countries combined on record on underground bases
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:47.200]  that are basically like shopping malls uh with pools and
[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:52.400]  10 years of food and and and artificial sunlight nuclear reactors and
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:56.320]  everything and then we're all up here with with these crooks playing god it
[03:03:56.320 --> 03:03:58.640]  makes me so angry god bless you i appreciate your call
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:02.320]  we're going to come back in this long segment final segment and go to joe
[03:04:02.320 --> 03:04:05.600]  chris tom and david and that's it because i've got a couple news articles i
[03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:08.880]  said i was going to hit and i got ahead of i mean i haven't even gotten into this
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:12.880]  incredibly arrogant statement i meant to have this is my top story today
[03:04:12.880 --> 03:04:16.960]  bailing out health insurers and helping obama care
[03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:22.720]  and a prominent consultant to health insurance companies
[03:04:22.720 --> 03:04:28.160]  robert lazowinsky recently wrote a remarkably candid
[03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:31.600]  blog post that while obama care is almost certain to cause insurance cost to
[03:04:31.600 --> 03:04:35.120]  skyrocket even higher than already has insurers won't
[03:04:35.120 --> 03:04:38.480]  be losing a lot of sleep over it he goes on the browser to make more money
[03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:42.640]  i mean that's that's ridiculous they wrote it to scam everybody and shut
[03:04:42.640 --> 03:04:45.120]  down their competition and now they're acting like
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:47.840]  oh gee we're not too worried we're gonna make more money
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:51.680]  i mean that's like going in and robbing a bank saying gee i
[03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:54.800]  i'm not too worried about this bank robber i'm gonna get some money
[03:04:54.800 --> 03:04:58.880]  acting like you're not the bank robber while you're holding the freaking gun

[03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:34.640]  behind put them on the back of our loan and lower our
[03:06:34.640 --> 03:06:37.840]  interest rate now we have a payment we can afford here's your chance to take

[03:08:28.560 --> 03:08:33.920]  all right we're taking calls from nuclear engineers
[03:08:33.920 --> 03:08:38.640]  physicists power plant nuclear power plant workers
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:42.240]  navy officers had a medical doctor on earlier as a guest
[03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:45.360]  getting your take on the increased radiation levels which we're going to
[03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:48.720]  another report or over the next few days with the reporters and then next week
[03:08:48.720 --> 03:08:51.200]  have some guests on but uh we're going to move out of this
[03:08:51.200 --> 03:08:55.280]  reporting soon let me try to really spotlight it to get a
[03:08:55.280 --> 03:08:58.800]  handle on it myself because i'm doing research on air with you
[03:08:58.800 --> 03:09:03.120]  right now just like everybody else i'm trying to figure this out
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:06.720]  with you right now i figured out a lot of other stuff
[03:09:06.720 --> 03:09:10.800]  i don't have this figured out so we're here having really university meetings
[03:09:10.800 --> 03:09:14.560]  together with all these different thinkers and experts and lay folks and
[03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:18.240]  myself and our reporters and we're trying to really
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:21.840]  do the job that government corporations and media are not doing
[03:09:21.840 --> 03:09:25.520]  and we don't claim to have all the answers we claim to care we claim to be
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:29.200]  involved we claim to be well researched and to correct ourselves when we're
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:33.520]  incorrect um but um
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:36.480]  we're just trying to find out what's happening here got some other news i'm
[03:09:36.480 --> 03:09:39.600]  going to hit here in a moment but first let's go through these calls quickly
[03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:43.680]  joe in georgia former military decontamination specialist
[03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:47.840]  what's your take on all this oh good afternoon alex thanks for taking my
[03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:53.040]  call i appreciate that well we have a ongoing nuclear war basically with
[03:09:53.040 --> 03:09:56.400]  bukkashima uh if you started a nuclear war you couldn't
[03:09:56.400 --> 03:10:01.520]  ask for a more perfect one than bukkashima uh it's a grave situation
[03:10:01.520 --> 03:10:04.800]  and it's going to be an extinction event for a lot of people
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:08.800]  and a lot of species so uh you're going to see
[03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:12.240]  all sorts of radioactivity up and down the coast different spots will have
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:16.000]  different levels obviously same way across the united states and
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:20.400]  as it progresses across the globe you have similar situation
[03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:26.560]  but uh the only radiation is this good radiation is no radiation and there's
[03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:31.440]  no such thing as decontamination that's a total misnomer
[03:10:31.440 --> 03:10:35.840]  you can only contain radiation you can't decontaminate from radiation you can
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:40.960]  only push radiation to some other place besides the space you're in
[03:10:40.960 --> 03:10:46.960]  so uh it's dire it's an extinction event for a lot of humanity
[03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:51.760]  and well that's what top physicist uh sezuki is saying and a lot of others i
[03:10:51.760 --> 03:10:55.040]  mean i hope it's not that bad i mean dr busby's
[03:10:55.040 --> 03:10:58.800]  says it's pretty bad my issue is five reactors got damaged two of them
[03:10:58.800 --> 03:11:01.680]  completely blew up one of them was a plutonium
[03:11:01.680 --> 03:11:05.440]  uranian actor mox three and i went and read what all the
[03:11:05.440 --> 03:11:09.120]  top folks said about that i mean and it's just pouring into the ocean because
[03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:11.360]  they use ocean water for those that don't know
[03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:14.000]  pumping out of the ocean onto it that runs right back in it's like a
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:18.080]  continual chair noble they debate it's 10 to 100 times
[03:11:18.080 --> 03:11:20.880]  worse than chair noble that's the that's the main line
[03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:23.440]  guesstimate they don't know it's just 10 times worse
[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:27.440]  sure noble killed a million plus people the un says
[03:11:27.440 --> 03:11:36.160]  since 86 so my only issue is uh
[03:11:36.160 --> 03:11:39.920]  how do we protect ourselves and again i sell iodine we fund ourselves with
[03:11:39.920 --> 03:11:42.720]  things people need i mean that's the best sales tactic in the world is
[03:11:42.720 --> 03:11:46.000]  sell stuff people really need it's like selling ice water in the sahara desert
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:49.920]  in the middle of summer to i mean i go out and go you know i i'm doing this for
[03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:54.560]  my family ought to sell the survival shield ought to
[03:11:54.560 --> 03:11:58.320]  buy this company up nobody even knows about this
[03:11:58.320 --> 03:12:02.720]  put it out high quality lower the price and fund my operation while i help
[03:12:02.720 --> 03:12:05.360]  people that's what we've done but it's a win-win-win across the
[03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:08.160]  board but uh that's that's not enough that just
[03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:14.160]  mitigates it a little bit um i mean i guess you live in
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:18.800]  georgia joe i mean what do you think we should do as a country
[03:12:18.800 --> 03:12:23.040]  well as a country we need to as as best we can
[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:27.280]  and all the experts and yourself using this platform that you have
[03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:32.000]  is clear your desk of all distractions and try to mobilize the
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:36.320]  a world community to attack this event in Fukushima
[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:40.240]  that is exactly what exactly where are all the big brains they're using
[03:12:40.240 --> 03:12:43.040]  homeless people and again i get emails when why are you bashing homeless
[03:12:43.040 --> 03:12:46.960]  people folks that's not what i'm doing you don't send
[03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:52.160]  you know poor sad alcoholic old men like they're expendable
[03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:56.480]  to try to save humanity you send the best men who want to be expendable for
[03:12:56.480 --> 03:12:59.120]  humanity i mean isn't that a no-brainer don't we
[03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:02.400]  send our best to try to take on the biggest crises
[03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:06.400]  we don't send our worst you shut down the half
[03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:10.400]  half the state of west virginia for some chemicals that leaked out of a tank
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:14.960]  into into some river and people are five days without water right now
[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:19.200]  but you don't say a word about Fukushima what does that tell you
[03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:24.800]  it tells you they don't think they can fix it well at least you try
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:27.840]  well they don't think they can fix it and there must be some benefit to
[03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:31.520]  somebody well yeah it's going to depopulate a
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:34.320]  lot of folks and as the doctor medical doctor said earlier they've got a lot
[03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:38.400]  of advanced technologies the elite have that they think and help you know
[03:13:38.400 --> 03:13:42.160]  cleanse themselves of it problem is radiation shoots through your DNA
[03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:45.200]  and gives you cancer and tissue damage i don't know how you
[03:13:45.200 --> 03:13:48.960]  i mean that's super science stuff i don't know how
[03:13:48.960 --> 03:13:52.720]  how once radiated like you said you can like
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:56.080]  try to stop the exposure and and get out of the area or get it
[03:13:56.080 --> 03:14:00.160]  but while you're there you're getting it uh very well said sir god bless you i
[03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:04.240]  appreciate you calling christ in north carolina you're on the air go ahead
[03:14:04.240 --> 03:14:09.520]  hello mr. jones hey thank you um i'm a i'm a recently retired
[03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:12.720]  intelligence analyst and i have a degree in homeland security
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:19.920]  and there's two points i wanted to make um i recommend as far as um how you can
[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:24.240]  you know because we need to go on offense and we need to go on defense
[03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:27.360]  and i think a great way we can go on offense but the government
[03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:30.640]  is that we can have people call from all over the country
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:35.040]  the epa or the cdc and we can record what they're saying
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:38.560]  and then those people that record what they're saying they can send to you or
[03:14:38.560 --> 03:14:41.920]  they can send somebody and basically you can you get a baseline
[03:14:41.920 --> 03:14:46.320]  of what each individual officer of that particular part of the government
[03:14:46.320 --> 03:14:49.680]  is doing exactly you've got to leverage you've got to leverage the general
[03:14:49.680 --> 03:14:52.720]  public as the human intelligence out there to do it they shouldn't even send it
[03:14:52.720 --> 03:14:56.240]  to us they should all put it on youtube
[03:14:56.240 --> 03:15:00.880]  think well exactly but but what's nice is if you can send it to a central area
[03:15:00.880 --> 03:15:04.560]  then then it's easier to to make the picture of what's going on
[03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:08.960]  no i understand so so an organic citizens threat fusion center which is
[03:15:08.960 --> 03:15:12.480]  really what info wars is but i'm not this is totally overwhelming for me to
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:16.400]  try to track all this data and i don't have the money to have the analyst to
[03:15:16.400 --> 03:15:20.400]  even be able to look at this so who does it i mean i
[03:15:20.400 --> 03:15:23.440]  i mean that's that was my job but i mean that's
[03:15:23.440 --> 03:15:26.960]  that's just a great way to kind of see what the deception
[03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:30.160]  because if they're all saying the same thing then you know there's a deception
[03:15:30.160 --> 03:15:32.640]  going on but um real quick i wanted to make a
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:36.160]  another another point and i wrote this down i'm recently retired
[03:15:36.160 --> 03:15:40.160]  i feel like god has called me to deliver this message
[03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:45.440]  um if that's okay um in intelligence training we learn how important open
[03:15:45.440 --> 03:15:48.720]  source intelligence is it is knowing what to do with this public
[03:15:48.720 --> 03:15:52.480]  information that is so vital the chinese often use the thousand
[03:15:52.480 --> 03:15:55.280]  grains of sand method of gathering intelligence
[03:15:55.280 --> 03:15:58.880]  which throughout history has been very effective each grant
[03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:02.880]  each grain of sand or person is given a certain mission that they are to go out
[03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:06.000]  and complete i feel many people on your station
[03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:09.440]  have a great idea of what really is going on in america today
[03:16:09.440 --> 03:16:12.480]  in a way we are the individual grains of sand
[03:16:12.480 --> 03:16:15.680]  it has become clear to me that christians are being persecuted
[03:16:15.680 --> 03:16:19.680]  with the recent reports of army instruct instructors labeled labeling
[03:16:19.680 --> 03:16:23.520]  traditional organizations terrorists the next irs
[03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:26.800]  scandal that seems likely will be directed at the church
[03:16:26.800 --> 03:16:30.560]  it is likely that homeland security will begin if not already to approach
[03:16:30.560 --> 03:16:34.720]  ministers of church which we know they have if the ministers are not prepared
[03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:38.240]  they will likely see the badge and hand over their member lists to protect
[03:16:38.240 --> 03:16:42.480]  themselves from the threat of terrorism it is vital that the listeners sit down
[03:16:42.480 --> 03:16:46.080]  with their ministers to let them know to not give over the list
[03:16:46.080 --> 03:16:50.400]  it is also important that they keep the list in a single secure location
[03:16:50.400 --> 03:16:53.920]  if we all do this at once it's like having thousands of brain
[03:16:53.920 --> 03:16:58.560]  with one objective if the preacher knows this could be coming then he likely
[03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:01.200]  will investigate this information himself
[03:17:01.200 --> 03:17:04.800]  eventually passing this information on to the church members
[03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:08.640]  we have the ability to create a chain reaction event that can wake up thousands
[03:17:08.640 --> 03:17:11.840]  if not millions oh my god you're such absolutely this is what you do you go
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:15.280]  into your church which is it's more than just get the list once they have the
[03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:18.720]  list they go you now work for us spy on people
[03:17:18.720 --> 03:17:21.680]  and there's no real terrorists in the congregation obviously but it won't
[03:17:21.680 --> 03:17:25.360]  matter later they're going to make the preacher
[03:17:25.360 --> 03:17:29.680]  sell radicalism to the church or pick him up
[03:17:29.680 --> 03:17:32.960]  and this is how an authoritarian takeover happens
[03:17:32.960 --> 03:17:37.120]  and that's what's so crazy i think it backfires too if we force a debate about
[03:17:37.120 --> 03:17:40.640]  this like you're saying then the military is able to see the
[03:17:40.640 --> 03:17:45.600]  thousand grains of sand and we are all our own open source threat fusion
[03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:48.240]  center and we see the real threat that's why
[03:17:48.240 --> 03:17:51.120]  threat fusion centers are actually waking up police and military
[03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:54.880]  because they're in the threat fusion centers watching us and seeing that we're
[03:17:54.880 --> 03:17:58.240]  telling the truth and going oh my god they're sitting in a globalist
[03:17:58.240 --> 03:18:01.040]  command base do you see what i'm talking about
[03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:05.360]  yeah here's the problem how as many christians today
[03:18:05.360 --> 03:18:09.760]  they're good people you have to realize that all this influence going on all the
[03:18:09.760 --> 03:18:14.800]  fluoride all the stuff on the tv it's dumbing us down so they're in a fog
[03:18:14.800 --> 03:18:18.320]  and we have to realize that and we have to wake them up because so many christians
[03:18:18.320 --> 03:18:21.600]  i know i know you know them too here's what they'll say to you
[03:18:21.600 --> 03:18:24.800]  they'll say well jesus christ will come back before then
[03:18:24.800 --> 03:18:29.120]  nowhere in the bible does it say that america can turn into hitlet that america
[03:18:29.120 --> 03:18:33.040]  won't turn into germany or hitlers you know type tactics
[03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:36.320]  you know people need to be aware they need to be awake and then you be prepared
[03:18:36.320 --> 03:18:39.120]  for the worst because this can happen and just as
[03:18:39.120 --> 03:18:44.080]  jesus said as in the times of noah so shall the end times be
[03:18:44.080 --> 03:18:46.800]  so i mean this is a real thing and people need to wake up
[03:18:46.800 --> 03:18:50.400]  and i really am concerned for the body of christ
[03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:53.840]  because the reason i'm so concerned is i know
[03:18:53.840 --> 03:18:57.520]  what's coming i know there's going to be things that are unexplainable
[03:18:57.520 --> 03:19:00.640]  and when these people that that that don't have
[03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:04.560]  the reality of the bible and what it really says because it's so much bigger
[03:19:04.560 --> 03:19:08.080]  and more it's just amazing what the bible actually says
[03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:10.800]  no i know it's all right there for those that have eyes to see
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:14.720]  but most don't do you have the same sense of serious concern
[03:19:14.720 --> 03:19:18.800]  about a huge event about to happen i
[03:19:18.800 --> 03:19:24.160]  here i mean honestly the biggest mistake that preachers ever taught
[03:19:24.160 --> 03:19:29.200]  was taking out the literal context of the fallen angels
[03:19:29.200 --> 03:19:34.240]  in the book of noah you know how you know i think these things how a whole
[03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:37.600]  world could be deceived and and you see it in the propaganda
[03:19:37.600 --> 03:19:41.120]  movies that the aliens came down and they planted the dna
[03:19:41.120 --> 03:19:45.360]  and stuff like that the nephilim i really i believe these things exist
[03:19:45.360 --> 03:19:49.840]  and i believe i mean you see you see the un has a leader for the
[03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:54.240]  for the alien in case the alien comes the catholic church is talking about
[03:19:54.240 --> 03:19:57.360]  if there's aliens the church will still exist
[03:19:57.360 --> 03:20:00.560]  now you see these people look at these ufo's and no no there's definitely
[03:20:00.560 --> 03:20:03.680]  something going on and they could stage something like project bluebeam too
[03:20:03.680 --> 03:20:06.240]  very well said we're skipping this final break here
[03:20:06.240 --> 03:20:09.200]  and overdrive to go to your calls very well said chris
[03:20:09.200 --> 03:20:14.640]  now it's it's it's crazy but just all the stuff we see is crazy the
[03:20:14.640 --> 03:20:17.440]  collapse evidence the depression globally the
[03:20:17.440 --> 03:20:21.200]  the police state build up the preparations for political persecution
[03:20:21.200 --> 03:20:25.280]  the the super bugs the the radiation the super
[03:20:25.280 --> 03:20:28.960]  volcano the the sun acting weird i mean it's like all
[03:20:28.960 --> 03:20:33.280]  hell is breaking loose folks and i hope we make it through whatever's coming
[03:20:33.280 --> 03:20:36.480]  but i mean china is threatening to invade islands now
[03:20:36.480 --> 03:20:40.240]  i mean that is just such massive news and it's nowhere in us news
[03:20:40.240 --> 03:20:46.800]  but drudgereport.com and info wars.com red linked on info wars.com
[03:20:46.800 --> 03:20:54.240]  this is so insane this is so insane meanwhile i go to the airport
[03:20:54.240 --> 03:20:58.480]  and some low level untrained and i'm not knocking them they just want jobs i
[03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:02.720]  don't hate the tsa people on average the supervisors are usually the thugs
[03:21:02.720 --> 03:21:05.760]  who wants to chat me down like i'm a terrorist and they'll go oh yeah i heard
[03:21:05.760 --> 03:21:09.280]  your show yesterday alex something's like you really think i'm a threat on the
[03:21:09.280 --> 03:21:12.800]  airplane i mean you know give me a break man
[03:21:12.800 --> 03:21:19.200]  give me a break i am not under suspicion i am innocent till proven guilty i am
[03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:22.480]  sick of the system treating good people like we're crooks
[03:21:22.480 --> 03:21:26.400]  that's what a tyranny does it wants to make you feel like you are bad
[03:21:26.400 --> 03:21:31.360]  and you've done something i have done nothing i don't do anything
[03:21:31.360 --> 03:21:35.760]  and i'm sick of it except exposed corruption
[03:21:35.760 --> 03:21:40.800]  as an act of survival not as an act of i'm a good guy and i got all the answers
[03:21:40.800 --> 03:21:44.480]  you got corruption just running rampant everywhere totally illegally spying on
[03:21:44.480 --> 03:21:48.400]  all of us harassing people domestically harassing christian groups
[03:21:48.400 --> 03:21:52.080]  all of it's illegal and then they're up there going well
[03:21:52.080 --> 03:21:56.320]  you know clobber is allowed a lot of congress me congress is like oh
[03:21:56.320 --> 03:21:59.280]  we're gonna let obama decide what to do with the nsa
[03:21:59.280 --> 03:22:04.080]  man that intelligence committee is just a bunch of
[03:22:04.080 --> 03:22:07.120]  traders of course they're all part of it they don't
[03:22:07.120 --> 03:22:10.000]  want to get the blame
[03:22:10.720 --> 03:22:14.720]  and again so many yuppies say well i don't have anything to hide
[03:22:14.720 --> 03:22:18.080]  your data is incredibly valuable dumb dumb
[03:22:18.080 --> 03:22:21.680]  for the select corporations and groups that get it to be able to model
[03:22:21.680 --> 03:22:25.760]  reality and the future to then
[03:22:25.760 --> 03:22:29.120]  high-frequency trading run by golden sacks on record
[03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:33.280]  cheats everybody else and is a fraud but they're so powerful they're allowed to
[03:22:33.280 --> 03:22:36.560]  do it it's like rigging a casino or a craps table
[03:22:36.560 --> 03:22:40.480]  giving you bad dice okay i'm trying to explain this to you
[03:22:40.480 --> 03:22:45.120]  it's rigged dummies and i'm talking to new listeners that don't get this
[03:22:45.120 --> 03:22:49.280]  they want all the data because they can dominate markets with it
[03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:53.520]  and then that destroys competition and then that destroys productivity and then
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:57.680]  that makes everything fall apart and then you've got a society based on fraud
[03:22:57.680 --> 03:23:01.600]  not based on quality and i'm not some goody tissues
[03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:04.480]  i'm not saying you're not always gonna have some fraud in the system
[03:23:04.480 --> 03:23:08.560]  we're not perfect but man the fraud is trying to push out
[03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:12.560]  the productivity and that's how you get a collapse because they can't help it
[03:23:12.560 --> 03:23:16.000]  folks they will they're greedy they want everything and they're going to screw
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:19.200]  the whole system so often i hear well i know what you're
[03:23:19.200 --> 03:23:21.200]  saying is true and it's worse than you say a lot of
[03:23:21.200 --> 03:23:24.160]  businessmen and people in government tell you but if this stuff comes out it'll
[03:23:24.160 --> 03:23:28.160]  bring the system down bring the system down the system is
[03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:32.000]  cancer the system the status quo is
[03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:38.800]  racing corruption so man i don't want status quo let me tell you right now
[03:23:38.800 --> 03:23:41.360]  i mean if we had a government that had some problems and there was some other
[03:23:41.360 --> 03:23:45.680]  group against that wanting to say change it but they were worse i would side
[03:23:45.680 --> 03:23:50.800]  with the lesser of two evils but while criticizing it i'd say this is not
[03:23:50.800 --> 03:23:52.560]  good i don't like some of the things with it but
[03:23:52.560 --> 03:23:56.080]  it's a lot better than that so we need to you know because it doesn't mean
[03:23:56.080 --> 03:23:58.960]  everything that comes along the road is something better
[03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:04.720]  but but we know that what this is is not good
[03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:08.320]  i mean what comes out of the other end of this thing is pure
[03:24:08.320 --> 03:24:12.160]  nightmare let's talk to dave in california thanks for holding
[03:24:12.160 --> 03:24:15.520]  here on the air from california is to say you work for the city you say city
[03:24:15.520 --> 03:24:20.240]  workers are ordering iodine yeah a couple things Alex
[03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:23.200]  first of all we don't need a war to stop all this evil
[03:24:23.200 --> 03:24:26.720]  you know you just cut the head off the snake and the body shall fall
[03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:30.800]  you know and then the other thing is yeah but i mean this is a bureaucracy of
[03:24:30.800 --> 03:24:35.040]  corporate and government interest worldwide who all hide who's behind what
[03:24:35.040 --> 03:24:38.800]  so how do you cut the head off a snake that's got a hundred heads
[03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:43.520]  really have a hundred heads we know that there's what six ruling families
[03:24:43.520 --> 03:24:48.480]  that's it well the problem is they've set up institutions and foundations
[03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:51.520]  the body will fall alex you cut the head off the body will fall
[03:24:51.520 --> 03:24:56.160]  you think so yes oh yes and then the other thing there but uh
[03:24:56.160 --> 03:24:59.760]  you're missing the point about fucca douche daichi and uh
[03:24:59.760 --> 03:25:03.600]  agenda 21 how do you think they're going to get people willingly to move to the
[03:25:03.600 --> 03:25:06.480]  east coast to get the land back to nature under agenda
[03:25:06.480 --> 03:25:11.120]  21 over here on the west coast oh let it get bad enough and then
[03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:15.200]  and then make rewild the west as the ewin has said
[03:25:15.200 --> 03:25:20.880]  yes then you force people to move back east live like sardines in a little can
[03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:27.120]  there's a myth in it they want this they want they want this what about the
[03:25:27.120 --> 03:25:31.280]  patriot you know act about the hundred mile unconstitutional zone around the
[03:25:31.280 --> 03:25:35.520]  the coast over here you know then you add the fucca douche into that and
[03:25:35.520 --> 03:25:38.560]  take us to the east coast
[03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:45.120]  let me ask you this question um what what's the intel you've got on city
[03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:50.800]  workers buying iodine and we're buying iodine for ourselves
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:56.000]  and it's just enough to get the organized to get people out of here
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:26:00.800]  that's all i can say without getting myself killed there buddy
[03:26:00.800 --> 03:26:04.880]  well that's that's that's that's wild um
[03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:07.360]  something what i mean are a lot of people waking up in government over there
[03:26:07.360 --> 03:26:10.320]  we know the federal government has bought 14 million doses
[03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:14.000]  um doses just a few weeks ago
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:16.720]  well let's to do this
[03:26:17.760 --> 03:26:20.720]  all right all right i appreciate your call very interesting points common oh
[03:26:20.720 --> 03:26:23.280]  why you're on the air thanks for holding
[03:26:23.280 --> 03:26:28.800]  retired fire captain radiation uh contamination uh certification what's
[03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:35.360]  your take on it sir yes sir and also uh mvc qualified as a navy
[03:26:35.360 --> 03:26:38.560]  qualman with a marine culture nine in vietnam
[03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:42.800]  uh my uh case is i want to talk about three things
[03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:47.920]  the first thing why you get those readings uh are you up to date on the
[03:26:47.920 --> 03:26:51.760]  parallel dump that occurred in the 50s and 60s
[03:26:51.760 --> 03:26:56.240]  i know there's been all sorts of dumping in the ocean um sir but but i mean
[03:26:56.240 --> 03:27:00.720]  that specific doesn't ring a bell well that's a radioactive uh i think it was
[03:27:00.720 --> 03:27:03.520]  medical waste cobalt things like that from
[03:27:03.520 --> 03:27:07.040]  radiation machines and low-level stuff that might have been stuffed in more
[03:27:07.040 --> 03:27:10.960]  and so there were more i don't know but they dumped it out there and
[03:27:10.960 --> 03:27:14.240]  years ago and uh we never fish out there
[03:27:14.240 --> 03:27:18.080]  never went there and it's been hot for years
[03:27:18.080 --> 03:27:21.680]  uh the other thing is uh the source supply for the city
[03:27:21.680 --> 03:27:24.960]  salmon sisters hatch hatching reservoir from 70
[03:27:24.960 --> 03:27:29.360]  comes down to the pipes and secondary holding is the crystal
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:33.200]  springs reservoir south of the city in the peninsula by
[03:27:33.200 --> 03:27:37.840]  san jale delmont village city that area uh
[03:27:37.840 --> 03:27:40.400]  you're going to do anything it's forced filtering
[03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:44.000]  that's probably the place to do it uh because you're going to get air
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:46.960]  condemnation there are two beautiful lakes
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:51.200]  there uh watershed no press press and that's the city and
[03:27:51.200 --> 03:27:55.520]  a peninsula water supply yeah everything you're saying is right on target
[03:27:55.520 --> 03:27:59.120]  your phone's breaking up a bit what's the bottom line here
[03:27:59.120 --> 03:28:02.480]  bottom line is like what your previous color said i'm not getting into the
[03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:06.560]  geopolitical baloney uh because my mayor was
[03:28:06.560 --> 03:28:11.760]  diane feinstein i would tell you enough uh you want any truth out of city hall
[03:28:11.760 --> 03:28:17.120]  or washington if you forget about uh but you want to just protect yourself
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:21.120]  and uh stay out of the rain use common sense the other thing i want to
[03:28:21.120 --> 03:28:25.120]  mention was the nerf team the neighborhood neighborhood emergency
[03:28:25.120 --> 03:28:29.760]  response teams we have a system that was set up primarily for the earthquake
[03:28:29.760 --> 03:28:33.040]  and fire from the o6 they didn't want to get full
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:38.880]  twice but now we have uh the nuclear problem and uh i haven't heard anything
[03:28:38.880 --> 03:28:41.760]  about that i think they're being set up for uh
[03:28:41.760 --> 03:28:45.760]  nuclear fire just to go out and let the homeless people in
[03:28:45.760 --> 03:28:51.120]  kapanaw the sad situation alex and uh
[03:28:51.120 --> 03:28:57.520]  uh i'll bet you anything the uh the guys that held my position of captain
[03:28:57.520 --> 03:29:01.040]  giant chief in the fire department simpsons
[03:29:01.040 --> 03:29:03.840]  still and on the peninsula the whole area
[03:29:03.840 --> 03:29:08.320]  emphasis go up on all the major hubs in the smaller cities too it's a lot of
[03:29:08.320 --> 03:29:11.760]  them are consolidated now so we're all kind of
[03:29:11.760 --> 03:29:15.840]  hard-wired together now so when some inflammation gets out
[03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:19.920]  they need to get out we get it and then it's pretty much
[03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:25.680]  uh decide that uh probably a level above uh fire administration whether it's
[03:29:25.680 --> 03:29:28.640]  in a glass of the car all right amazingly interesting call me back when
[03:29:28.640 --> 03:29:32.400]  you get a better connection sometime i guess that's one of the retired fire
[03:29:32.400 --> 03:29:35.040]  captain from san francisco living in hawaii now
[03:29:35.040 --> 03:29:38.240]  very interesting wow i love talking to those folks i'm so flattered we have
