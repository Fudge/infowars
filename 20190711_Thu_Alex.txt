[00:00.000 --> 00:11.780]  Jeffrey Epstein is behind bars today after pleading not guilty to sex trafficking.
[00:11.780 --> 00:16.820]  Accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls as young as 14 years old.
[00:16.820 --> 00:23.900]  This all begins when the Palm Beach police get a tip from some parents about a child
[00:23.900 --> 00:28.020]  coming home with her lunchbox full of money.
[00:28.020 --> 00:32.200]  When they ask her where the money comes from, it's clear that it comes from Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:32.200 --> 00:35.760]  Prosecutors say they made a disturbing discovery at his mansion.
[00:35.760 --> 00:39.920]  Thousands of nude photos of underage girls were found there.
[00:39.920 --> 00:46.220]  And inside of a locked safe, compact discs, one allegedly labeled Young Miscellaneous Nudes
[00:46.220 --> 00:47.220]  One.
[00:47.220 --> 00:51.320]  This is video of Jeffrey Epstein's home taken by investigators during a search of the
[00:51.320 --> 00:53.280]  multi-millionaires Palm Beach mansion.
[00:53.280 --> 00:57.880]  It is where Epstein was involved with at least 40 underage girls.
[00:57.880 --> 00:59.660]  Some of whom he had sex with.
[00:59.660 --> 01:03.360]  Epstein has had several high-profile friendships in the past.
[01:03.360 --> 01:07.640]  President Bill Clinton reportedly rode on Epstein's jet more than two dozen times in
[01:07.640 --> 01:08.640]  the early 2000s.
[01:08.640 --> 01:12.600]  It's no secret that former President Bill Clinton had a friendly relationship with
[01:12.600 --> 01:13.600]  Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:13.600 --> 01:19.640]  A former secret service agent is threatening to release damaging information on former President
[01:19.640 --> 01:20.760]  Bill Clinton.
[01:20.760 --> 01:27.640]  Dan Bongino says he may release information on Clinton's 26 documented trips on Jeffrey
[01:27.640 --> 01:32.360]  Epstein's plane jet, Private Jet, the Lolita Express.
[01:32.360 --> 01:37.920]  Leasy Wall Street tycoon Jeffrey Epstein used the Lolita Express to ferry a bevy of beautiful
[01:37.920 --> 01:38.920]  young women.
[01:38.920 --> 01:43.120]  Among the passengers, former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew.
[01:43.120 --> 01:52.520]  FAA records show that Bill Clinton is on the airplane of Jeffrey Epstein 26 times.
[01:52.520 --> 01:57.200]  Newly obtained documents show Clinton actually took at least 26 flights on Epstein's private
[01:57.200 --> 01:59.200]  jet to spots around the globe.
[01:59.200 --> 02:09.440]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, mainstream corporate media, Wikipedia are all covering up what's
[02:09.440 --> 02:10.600]  really happening.
[02:10.600 --> 02:16.480]  They are all covering up any connection to Epstein to the Clintons or the logs on the
[02:16.480 --> 02:18.280]  airplanes with the little girls.
[02:18.280 --> 02:21.080]  Sources say there were dozens of victims.
[02:21.080 --> 02:24.520]  The teen girls were encouraged to recruit their friends.
[02:24.520 --> 02:27.440]  We were underage, we were little girls.
[02:27.440 --> 02:32.120]  By the time I was 16, I brought him up to 75 girls.
[02:32.120 --> 02:37.240]  All the ages of, you know, 14, 15, 16, people going from eighth grade to ninth grade at
[02:37.240 --> 02:40.600]  just school parties is where I'd recruit him from.
[02:40.600 --> 02:45.680]  You know, before you know it, I'm being lent out to politicians and to academics and to
[02:45.680 --> 02:51.240]  people that, royalty and people that you just, you would never think like, how did you get
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.080]  into that position of power in the first place if you're this disgusting, evil, decrepit
[02:56.080 --> 02:57.080]  person on the inside.
[02:57.080 --> 03:02.960]  An absolute secret, the U.S. government negotiated a deal that forgave multi-billionaire Jeff
[03:02.960 --> 03:06.840]  Epstein for procuring sex with about 40 children.
[03:06.840 --> 03:11.880]  The 2008 agreement protects Epstein and anyone who worked with him from federal charges.
[03:11.880 --> 03:14.360]  He was basically treated as a celebrity.
[03:14.360 --> 03:18.520]  He was allowed to come and go six days a week from the jail as he wanted.
[03:18.520 --> 03:22.440]  Every morning, a chauffeur would come pick him up and drive him to his office where he
[03:22.440 --> 03:26.440]  would spend the day doing whatever he wanted to do and then check back in at night.
[03:26.440 --> 03:32.880]  And he arranged it so that he got work released, which meant that he had a valet, a driver
[03:32.880 --> 03:36.360]  that he hired, pick him up at the jail every day.
[03:36.360 --> 03:43.760]  Unbelievably, this evil pedophile monster served just 13 months in a county jail for
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.760]  his crimes.
[03:44.760 --> 03:50.200]  The U.S. attorney who authorized that deal, Alexander Acosta, now the secretary of labor.
[03:50.200 --> 03:58.520]  Acosta is a George W. Bush appointee under the Bush Justice Department and he conducts
[03:58.520 --> 03:59.520]  his own investigation.
[03:59.520 --> 04:03.800]  He rubber stamps the state charge and then he seals it.
[04:03.800 --> 04:08.640]  They were told, leave it alone, Jeffrey Epstein works for U.S. intelligence and the FBI.
[04:08.640 --> 04:15.080]  Now Bradley Edwards determined to get a federal judge to overturn the sweetheart plea deal.
[04:15.080 --> 04:20.560]  Somebody with money and power was able to communicate with the government in secrecy,
[04:20.560 --> 04:24.040]  in direct violation of the rights of the crime victims.
[04:24.040 --> 04:28.040]  It's scary because this is our government that's supposed to protect us but has done
[04:28.040 --> 04:31.560]  everything to protect, you know, a pedophile.
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.560]  Giant pedophile rinks controlling the deep state are now being exposed.
[04:35.560 --> 04:40.440]  Well I started getting somewhat of an inclination that this is a situation where somehow, for
[04:40.440 --> 04:45.120]  some reason, the defendant and the government are working together against the victims although
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.680]  that kind of conspiracy theory sounds so preposterous that I didn't want to believe it.
[04:49.680 --> 04:55.480]  We told you about Jeffrey Epstein and everything he was up to and who he is years ago.
[04:55.480 --> 05:00.960]  Now it's going to hit the mainstream.
[05:00.960 --> 05:04.920]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square,
[05:04.920 --> 05:08.720]  the other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it isn't the only network of this
[05:08.720 --> 05:13.160]  reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed
[05:13.160 --> 05:17.400]  by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.520]  independent of all that.
[05:18.520 --> 05:24.200]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[05:24.200 --> 05:28.080]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[05:28.080 --> 05:32.440]  the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[05:32.440 --> 05:35.960]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[05:35.960 --> 05:39.800]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[05:39.800 --> 05:43.920]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to
[05:43.920 --> 05:48.520]  have or express or hear and the Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[05:48.520 --> 05:52.880]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[05:52.880 --> 05:57.600]  freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[05:57.600 --> 06:07.600]  lawfare and liable targeting youth.
[06:07.600 --> 06:14.080]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:14.080 --> 06:20.440]  front lines of the Info War.
[06:20.440 --> 06:26.440]  Well President Trump in tweets today is pledging to take action against big tech election meddling
[06:26.440 --> 06:31.400]  and censorship raging across not just the United States but across the authoritarian
[06:31.400 --> 06:35.520]  and so called free world.
[06:35.520 --> 06:41.600]  It's Thursday July 11th 2019 we just kicked off at 8am this morning with David Knight
[06:41.600 --> 06:48.600]  a special 34 hour continual live transmission that ends tomorrow evening at 6pm.
[06:48.600 --> 06:56.200]  We've got a crew of six people or is it seven people in Washington DC, Millie Weaver and
[06:56.200 --> 07:02.200]  her crew, Owen Schreuer and his crew, Caitlin Bennett and her crew I guess that's oh no
[07:02.200 --> 07:08.080]  that's eight people and listen a lot of folks are saying Alex why weren't you invited to
[07:08.080 --> 07:10.440]  the social media summit with President Trump?
[07:10.440 --> 07:17.640]  Well if I was invited it would become the only story about it and I've been so demonized
[07:17.640 --> 07:21.720]  by the left and by corporate media because they know that Info Wars represents Trump's
[07:21.720 --> 07:28.840]  base that if I was to go to that event it would be nothing but a distraction like a
[07:28.840 --> 07:30.920]  Matt Drudge or somebody went to it.
[07:30.920 --> 07:36.760]  This is about organizing people that are in social media that are meme makers to try to
[07:36.760 --> 07:41.160]  develop a plan of action for the president to take action against big tech censorship
[07:41.160 --> 07:46.000]  and to wait for the president to draw attention to the censorship and let the world know that
[07:46.000 --> 07:47.600]  he's going to be taking action.
[07:47.600 --> 07:49.480]  Not a lot has been released about the summit.
[07:49.480 --> 07:53.760]  I've been told quite a bit by folks that have been invited to the White House already last
[07:53.760 --> 07:58.280]  week like Carpe Donkton and others and what they've been told about the breakaway groups
[07:58.280 --> 08:04.080]  that are going to be taking place all day today and all day Friday and some folks into
[08:04.080 --> 08:05.080]  the weekend.
[08:05.080 --> 08:10.600]  There's also some late night parties and events that our camera crews have been invited to
[08:10.600 --> 08:15.600]  we'll be there covering all of that but I want to explain something Info Wars is about
[08:15.600 --> 08:17.400]  leadership.
[08:17.400 --> 08:18.840]  This audience is about leadership.
[08:18.840 --> 08:26.240]  We created the reboot of the 1776 worldwide nationalist movement and Paul Watson I wouldn't
[08:26.240 --> 08:31.520]  say was butthurt that he wasn't invited but he did mention wow I'm kind of black pilled
[08:31.520 --> 08:35.680]  you know I'm being censored I'm being attacked I've been listed as the verboten one along
[08:35.680 --> 08:41.120]  with Alex Jones Facebook put out terms of service saying people can organize our murder
[08:41.120 --> 08:46.120]  that was up for a few days they removed it yesterday from their terms of service it's
[08:46.120 --> 08:52.040]  just getting insane but it's because we are the vanguard that if we were there it would
[08:52.040 --> 08:58.240]  take over the event and let's really get down the brass tacks.
[08:58.240 --> 09:01.560]  President Trump's invited me to the White House he's invited me to Trump Tower Marlago
[09:01.560 --> 09:05.720]  all that stuff and I said Mr. President don't worry about that I don't need to have you
[09:05.720 --> 09:10.400]  pat me on the head I need to just talk to you about policy that's what I want and
[09:10.400 --> 09:16.580]  Trump really likes that and so that's what's happening here is I don't go to the White
[09:16.580 --> 09:21.840]  House to get patted on the head I'm here to help create policy with you the audience
[09:21.840 --> 09:27.480]  for countervailing talking points to counter the globalist that we put out.
[09:27.480 --> 09:32.960]  We are the heart of the resistance now people like James O'Keefer there he is incredibly
[09:32.960 --> 09:39.400]  important to the whole fight Carpe Donkton amazing Mark Dice so many others but look
[09:39.400 --> 09:44.440]  at what happened to Ben Garrison he criticized George Soros and the media all called him
[09:44.440 --> 09:48.800]  an anti-Semite so whoever is organizing this the press secretary thought well let's not
[09:48.800 --> 09:55.040]  make it about that let's remove Garrison well that only then encouraged all of the other
[09:55.040 --> 09:59.400]  media to start calling everyone white supremacist and calling the whole list that so at a certain
[09:59.400 --> 10:06.840]  point I get not having Alex Jones there but at another point Ben Garrison has never been
[10:06.840 --> 10:10.840]  accused of that there's no truth to it it's a bunch of bull should have the old dying
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.520]  corporate media the same ones that claim Trump is raping women and abusing women in public
[10:15.520 --> 10:19.320]  all the time and none of it's true well if we went by the mainstream media's yardstick
[10:19.320 --> 10:26.120]  that they're the arbiters of reality and they decide who's acceptable in society no one
[10:26.120 --> 10:34.000]  right of Mao Zedong would be out walking around a free person so it's pretty amazing
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  that all of this is going on it's very very dangerous so let me just cut right to the
[10:41.000 --> 10:48.360]  facts there are quite a few people inside of that event that we helped with their original
[10:48.360 --> 10:54.840]  funding their original promotion their original platform and so I knew all about the meeting
[10:54.840 --> 10:58.400]  before it happened before it was announced I know all about what the meeting is going
[10:58.400 --> 11:03.000]  to be about and I've got a lot of the key people inside the meeting but understand
[11:03.000 --> 11:10.440]  we created the policy out here in the Midwest and in Texas and in places like Idaho and
[11:10.440 --> 11:20.240]  you know Oregon outside of Portland Portland's another country we are the dog DC is the tail
[11:20.240 --> 11:26.920]  so again we're not grasping individuals trying to be part of the inside club we are creating
[11:26.920 --> 11:31.240]  the relaunch of Americana we are the tip of the spear we're the blood that flows to the
[11:31.240 --> 11:36.280]  veins and arteries of the rebirth of the nation we are the blood of victory the blood of liberty
[11:36.280 --> 11:44.880]  we are the win in the sales we are 1776 worldwide so make no mistake that I've told Paul this
[11:44.880 --> 11:49.080]  and he was just a little tiffed and I've told Owen this who shot a video in front of the
[11:49.080 --> 11:53.240]  White House saying hey it's good that we're outside the White House because it shows that
[11:53.240 --> 11:58.360]  we really are the vanguard of anti-establishment that could still see Owen's a little bit irritated
[11:58.360 --> 12:02.620]  by it because you know Ellen used to shoot videos on YouTube the average video got five
[12:02.620 --> 12:06.560]  million views he had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[12:06.560 --> 12:10.000]  hundreds and hundreds of millions of views on his own channel hundreds of millions with
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.760]  us everywhere he went he totally kicked ass as a reporter and he's been lumped in with
[12:14.760 --> 12:19.040]  me and put into the Phantom Zone but see now they're moving on to everybody else in the
[12:19.040 --> 12:28.040]  Phantom Zone now Professor Lott who's super revered does FBI statistics for the FBI he's
[12:28.040 --> 12:34.960]  been banned off Twitter for putting out statistics about mass shootings so it's it's never gonna
[12:34.960 --> 12:39.880]  end so if you're gonna get banned isn't it better to be banned first if you're gonna
[12:39.880 --> 12:45.920]  be the black sheep isn't it best to be the biggest fattest strongest one on the hill
[12:45.920 --> 12:51.200]  that everybody knows is the black sheep like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and
[12:51.200 --> 12:57.040]  Benjamin Franklin and Patrick Henry and Sam Adams and John Hancock Lord ladies and gentlemen
[12:57.040 --> 13:05.520]  they were the black sheep the devil even people that were pro-american independence would not
[13:05.520 --> 13:13.040]  be seen or associate with the 3% who started with one tenth of 1% even a year before the
[13:13.040 --> 13:18.440]  war ended most people that were already secretly pro-independence would not associate with
[13:18.440 --> 13:23.040]  George Washington or Benjamin Franklin or Thomas Jefferson do you understand what leadership
[13:23.040 --> 13:28.440]  is about leadership ladies and gentlemen is about doing what you know is right when everybody's
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.520]  coming down on you because you know it's right and you know it's best for society and you
[13:33.520 --> 13:39.800]  know in the end you've got a shot at winning and making a better world at best at worst
[13:39.800 --> 13:43.240]  you'll be destroyed but still you'll be right in the eyes of God and that's what really
[13:43.240 --> 13:49.920]  matters so that's what this is all about ladies and gentlemen we guide the policy in the White
[13:49.920 --> 13:55.280]  House the globalist fear us they fear your word of mouth they fear you what you're doing
[13:55.280 --> 14:01.520]  and speaking of that we've launched a 34 hour special broadcast at info wars.com forward

[18:07.640 --> 18:11.800]  out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with
[18:11.800 --> 18:16.520]  these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because
[18:16.520 --> 18:20.520]  they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public
[18:20.520 --> 18:25.080]  the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency
[18:25.080 --> 18:28.440]  it's the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to
[18:28.440 --> 18:32.120]  be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know
[18:32.120 --> 18:37.000]  they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on

[19:59.880 --> 20:14.520]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:30.040 --> 20:40.680]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host so the corporate media literally in league with the chai
[20:40.680 --> 20:50.840]  comms has a tough job cut out for them they have basically no viewers they are going bankrupt
[20:50.840 --> 20:56.920]  they're having huge layoffs they're having to have pep rallies at nbc news because the people are so
[20:56.920 --> 21:06.840]  depressed at the layoffs and pay cuts but they've still got i'm sorry aging uh fossils of the republican
[21:06.840 --> 21:11.880]  and democratic party establishment that think they're all powerful and think that america really
[21:11.880 --> 21:18.760]  listens to them and so there's hundreds of headlines i've already seen that trump invites
[21:18.760 --> 21:27.320]  right-wing extremists to the white house for the social media summit trump has white supremacist
[21:27.320 --> 21:33.800]  to social media summit none of it's true when you look at who it is it's mark dice
[21:35.480 --> 21:41.560]  it's james o' keith it's carpe donkton but cnn has all these videos we're going to play later
[21:41.560 --> 21:47.880]  that look like mug shots up there and they show you the different people and who how bad they are
[21:49.080 --> 21:54.040]  this person says there's only two genders and this person says we shouldn't have dragged queen
[21:54.040 --> 22:00.840]  story time for the children but who's not there are the dangerous individuals alex jones paul
[22:00.840 --> 22:05.720]  watson laura lumar malo enopoulos they threw in lewis fair con people kept saying why are you
[22:05.720 --> 22:10.440]  banning all the right wingers and not lewis fair con oh no the really dangerous people that facebook
[22:10.440 --> 22:17.240]  put in its terms of service that you can promote their physical attack even their death oh no none
[22:17.240 --> 22:23.560]  of those folks were invited because again people at the white house not trump are scared of the
[22:23.560 --> 22:30.680]  media pointing out those of us that have uh some racy things we've said under the first amendment
[22:31.320 --> 22:36.200]  and actually getting some legitimacy to the claim that we're these bad evil extremists
[22:36.200 --> 22:44.120]  why do we let the establishment shit the benchmark why do we let the anti-american globalist
[22:44.120 --> 22:49.800]  that tell us that aoc who says america sucks is good but we're bad or that illan omar who
[22:49.800 --> 22:56.440]  married her brother came here criminally says she hates the nation why do we bow down and
[22:56.440 --> 23:02.520]  coward of these people why do we let them tell us what the standards are it's like the mouse
[23:02.520 --> 23:06.920]  conquering the lion and coming up next segment i've got the tucker carlsson
[23:08.760 --> 23:13.000]  pc did he did a few nights ago where they're calling for him to step down over because he
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.200]  points out that illan omar has said she hates this country and that's what she said over and over again
[23:18.200 --> 23:23.960]  she constantly runs it down the democrats constantly run it down they say that the board of patrols
[23:23.960 --> 23:29.400]  putting children in concentration camps which they're not and then they show cages from the obama
[23:29.400 --> 23:39.560]  era knowing it's a fraud and then meanwhile tommy robinson jailed for nine months over contempt
[23:39.560 --> 23:45.480]  of court wore a shirt as she marched into jail this morning with katie hopkins will be joining
[23:45.480 --> 23:52.920]  us tomorrow she's an auxiliary info wars reporter wearing a shirt saying convicted of islam oh no
[23:52.920 --> 24:00.040]  no no that's radical islam's totally and completely legal in the uk the grooming of girls the ashen
[24:00.040 --> 24:04.600]  attacks the cutting little girls genitals off the government basically leaves that alone tacitly has
[24:04.600 --> 24:12.200]  made it legal no wearing the shirt of the term that i coined this week convicted of journalism
[24:13.240 --> 24:20.680]  and on the back of the shirt it says the uk equals north korea oh an antifa
[24:20.680 --> 24:27.160]  got to throw things and punch people and attack the big crowd that was out there chanting free
[24:27.160 --> 24:35.880]  tommy free tommy and the media spun it again that it was an ugly scene as furious tommy robinson
[24:35.880 --> 24:43.080]  supporters riot outside parliament and burn eu flags after the edl founder was jailed for nine
[24:43.080 --> 24:49.720]  months for contempt notice he didn't get a jury trial the magna karta says that's 1215 the basis
[24:49.720 --> 24:55.800]  of all western law that you must have a jury of your peers if you face more than six months in jail
[24:55.800 --> 25:00.840]  and current laws say the same thing and the law and contempt says the same thing but they don't
[25:00.840 --> 25:08.360]  care do they know because whether it's australia or the uk or europe or the us or canada or new
[25:08.360 --> 25:14.520]  zealand they're all using the judiciary and the police to violate rights and every few days
[25:14.520 --> 25:20.840]  another congressman another congresswoman another cnn reporter another msnbc pundit says
[25:21.400 --> 25:28.840]  arrest people that disagree with us arrest people that promote info wars dot com physically attack
[25:28.840 --> 25:38.200]  alex jones it's okay and now cnn analyst says young people need to be trained to do away with
[25:38.200 --> 25:45.880]  conservative media steve watch an article on info wars dot com it will just be a bad memory this is
[25:45.880 --> 25:54.360]  cnn analyst yesterday that young people should be trained host john berman an analyst ariel
[25:54.360 --> 26:02.440]  lewis discussed tucker carlson and how horrible he is saying that ilhan omar doesn't love america
[26:02.440 --> 26:08.600]  here it is we know that there are lots of young girls who are watching the women's uh soccer team
[26:08.600 --> 26:13.320]  and they're being inspired and they're gonna sort of change the world uh there are a lot of people
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.440]  i happen to have been one of them as a kid who saw all kinds of racist garbage coming out over the
[26:18.440 --> 26:23.000]  airwaves you know people like tucker carlson and it was one of the things that inspired me to get
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.920]  into this business to try and drive away the vestiges of that garbage i mean on talk radio in
[26:28.920 --> 26:33.000]  particular you heard it for years and years and years just spewing this kind of garbage and that
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.040]  i mean it's it's it's stuff like that and things like what he said last night are going to be said
[26:38.040 --> 26:43.720]  all over the airwaves all day today and tomorrow and the next day and it's a wake up call it is an
[26:43.720 --> 26:49.000]  alarm uh to to the rest of us that we need to train young people get them into the media get them
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.200]  into broadcasting and do away with that stuff so it'll just be a bad memory i like that glass half
[26:54.200 --> 27:01.960]  full analysis of the silver lining do away with that sort of stuff so it will just be a bad memory
[27:02.840 --> 27:05.400]  if that reminds me of somebody else the former attorney general
[27:05.960 --> 27:09.880]  eric holder when he said we need to tell the media at a media conference
[27:09.880 --> 27:13.080]  on c span to brainwash the public against guns remember this
[27:14.840 --> 27:20.040]  to do is change the way in which people think about guns especially young people one thing that
[27:20.040 --> 27:24.840]  i think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive
[27:24.840 --> 27:29.640]  about this it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a monday and then only do it every
[27:29.640 --> 27:35.000]  monday we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.880]  about guns in a vastly different way and here's fred rica wilson last week on national television
[27:41.880 --> 27:50.600]  at a speech saying you make fun of me you're going to go to jail here she is those people who are
[27:51.320 --> 28:00.680]  online making fun of members of congress are disgrace and there's no need for anyone to
[28:00.680 --> 28:06.920]  think that is unacceptable we're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut
[28:06.920 --> 28:12.760]  them down and they should be prosecuted we're going to break when we come back i'm going to air
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.640]  the tucker carlson segment from two nights ago that has every corporate establishment
[28:17.640 --> 28:23.720]  anti-free speech anti-american media outlet calling for his head and then we're going to
[28:23.720 --> 28:29.560]  go over some of the quotes and some of the things that ilhan omar has said about america before and
[28:29.560 --> 28:35.080]  the statements about the bore patrol should be disbanded and that they're terrorist and that
[28:35.080 --> 28:41.560]  that they are concentration camps but she sure as hell got here and then got on welfare right away
[28:41.560 --> 28:49.160]  and there's just a disgusting lazy rat a disgusting lazy america hating rat rat i can't go to samalia

[32:01.480 --> 32:08.120]  the most banned network in the world so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting
[32:08.120 --> 32:12.680]  structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting
[32:12.680 --> 32:18.360]  one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of
[32:18.360 --> 32:24.360]  this public reach it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining
[32:24.360 --> 32:29.320]  self-structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content
[32:29.320 --> 32:33.880]  goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting
[32:33.880 --> 32:38.200]  info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or
[32:38.200 --> 32:42.360]  fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the
[32:42.360 --> 32:47.000]  corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support
[32:47.000 --> 32:51.800]  speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to
[32:51.800 --> 32:56.840]  hold and it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[32:56.840 --> 33:09.880]  of free press and free speech with free markets you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:09.880 --> 33:30.600]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live
[33:30.600 --> 33:39.080]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones the democratic candidates for president are on
[33:39.080 --> 33:43.720]  the road this week telling voters that the united states is an awful country america's institutions
[33:43.720 --> 33:49.160]  are built on white supremacy squeak debate or work in an event yesterday of all the lies these
[33:49.160 --> 33:54.920]  people tell and there are many this is the most absurd in fact the united states is the kindest
[33:54.920 --> 34:00.600]  most open-minded place on the planet the us has done more for other people and received less in
[34:00.600 --> 34:08.120]  return than any nation in history by far americans like to help makes us feel good so of our deepest
[34:08.120 --> 34:12.680]  satisfaction as a country comes from watching penniless immigrants arrive on our shores
[34:12.680 --> 34:19.320]  buy into our values and thrive we call it the american dream and nothing makes us prouder it
[34:19.320 --> 34:25.320]  was in that spirit that in 1992 the united states welcomed ten-year-old ilhan omar and her family
[34:25.320 --> 34:29.720]  omar was born in somalia one of the world's poorest countries it was then ruled by a marxist
[34:29.720 --> 34:34.440]  military dictatorship when omar was sick she and her parents and their six siblings fled a
[34:34.440 --> 34:39.960]  worsting civil war and wound up in a refugee camp in kenya they spent four years there until
[34:39.960 --> 34:45.560]  america offered the family asylum here and let them settle in minneapolis omar's father drove a
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.920]  taxi at first then got a job at the post office working for the government omar meanwhile grew up
[34:50.920 --> 34:55.960]  free in the world's richest country with all the bounty that that implies she became a citizen
[34:55.960 --> 35:00.440]  that went to work at a state university a few years later she became a member of congress elected
[35:00.440 --> 35:07.160]  by voters who were proud to see an immigrant succeed omar is now at the age of only 36 one of the
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.840]  most powerful women in america it's an amazing story really only in this country could it have
[35:12.840 --> 35:20.520]  happened ilan omar has an awful lot to be grateful for but she isn't grateful not at all after everything
[35:20.520 --> 35:26.520]  america has done for omar and for her family she hates this country more than ever in a recent
[35:26.520 --> 35:33.000]  piece in the washington post the reporter put it this way quote in omar's version america isn't the
[35:33.000 --> 35:38.680]  big hearted country that saved her from a brutal war and a bleak refugee camp it wasn't a meritocracy
[35:38.680 --> 35:44.040]  that helped her attend college or vaulted her into congress instead it was the country that had
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.560]  failed to live up to its founding ideals a place that had disappointed her and so many
[35:49.560 --> 35:56.920]  immigrants refugees and minorities like her end quote if anything that's an understatement omar isn't
[35:56.920 --> 36:03.000]  disappointed in america she's enraged by it virtually every public statement she makes accuses
[36:03.000 --> 36:09.080]  americans of bigotry and racism this is an immoral country she says she is undisguised contempt for
[36:09.080 --> 36:14.040]  the united states and for its people that should worry you and not just because omar is now a
[36:14.040 --> 36:19.080]  sitting member of congress ilan omar is living proof that the way we practice immigration
[36:19.080 --> 36:25.400]  has become dangerous to this country a system designed to strengthen america is instead undermining
[36:25.400 --> 36:31.320]  it some of the very people we try hardest to help have come to hate us passionately maybe that's
[36:31.320 --> 36:35.640]  our fault for asking too little of our immigrants we aren't self-confident enough to make them
[36:35.640 --> 36:40.120]  assimilate so they never feel fully american or maybe the problem is deeper than that maybe we're
[36:40.120 --> 36:44.440]  importing people from places whose values are simply antithetical to ours who knows what the
[36:44.440 --> 36:50.440]  problem is but there is a problem and whatever the cause this cannot continue it's not sustainable
[36:50.440 --> 36:55.320]  no country can import large numbers of people who hate it and expect to survive the romans
[36:55.320 --> 37:01.240]  are the last to try that with predictable results so be grateful for ilan omar annoying as she is
[37:01.240 --> 37:06.520]  she's a living fire alarm a warning to the rest of us we better change our immigration system
[37:06.520 --> 37:13.800]  immediately or else hi could i get i mean could you tell me do you do agree with aoc that ice is
[37:13.800 --> 37:22.040]  running to uh concentration camps on the border there are camps and people are being concentrated
[37:22.040 --> 37:27.720]  this is very simple i don't even know why this is a controversial thing for her to say we have to
[37:28.600 --> 37:33.960]  really truthfully speak about what's taking place and this is why it's really important for us to
[37:33.960 --> 37:39.320]  abolish ice and make sure that we have an agency that is accountable to the people that is dealing
[37:39.320 --> 37:48.120]  with the situation in a humane way there's no there's no way that we can allow for kids to be
[37:48.120 --> 37:54.600]  caged uh in in this country and and children to be separated from their families uh and people
[37:55.160 --> 38:00.760]  being terrorized in their communities um is it fair to have to make sure that we are calling it out
[38:00.760 --> 38:08.520]  and i am hundred percent without think about that and there's countless quotes by her of similar
[38:08.520 --> 38:11.960]  things you know people are flooding into the country by the hundreds of thousands they're
[38:11.960 --> 38:16.440]  trying to get in one third of the children are with people that aren't their parents there's
[38:16.440 --> 38:22.520]  massive child smuggling drug smuggling you name it underground tunnels submarines with you know
[38:22.520 --> 38:28.120]  thousands of pounds of cocaine being captured hundreds of thousands dead on the mexico side
[38:28.120 --> 38:35.320]  but the illusion the fantasy is that america is bad but everybody's trying to get into it
[38:35.960 --> 38:42.280]  because it's so horrible because it's so evil and then ilhan says oh because they're concentrated
[38:42.840 --> 38:50.200]  whatever that means it's a concentration camp that's like saying people in line to get into
[38:50.200 --> 38:56.840]  disney world are in a concentration camp too so she knows that we have a conscience she knows
[38:56.840 --> 39:03.800]  that we have a soul she's a sociopath from a culture of piracy and sex slavery and
[39:03.800 --> 39:10.680]  this absolute barbarism and she sees you as the other as the outsider and she's here to conquer you
[39:10.680 --> 39:17.800]  as tucker carlson just said and now they want tucker carlson off the air you heard the democrats
[39:17.800 --> 39:27.640]  earlier you heard cnn they said it's time to do away with all talk radio with fox news with anyone
[39:28.200 --> 39:34.440]  and everyone that doesn't do exactly what they say when they say how they say by the way ladies
[39:34.440 --> 39:39.640]  and gentlemen info wars despite all the so-called shadow bans and things and the outright man's
[39:39.640 --> 39:45.320]  is still reaching record numbers of people via direct word of mouth and via folks sharing
[39:45.320 --> 39:49.560]  our articles in our videos and people taking our articles and videos and taking my name out of it
[39:49.560 --> 39:54.600]  taking in fours out of it and it's going viral everywhere and because i've been banned so many
[39:54.600 --> 40:02.440]  places the real thought makers the real decision makers uh the thought leaders more than ever tune
[40:02.440 --> 40:08.680]  in so we always had a great audience but the quality of the audience was always excellent it's gone
[40:08.680 --> 40:13.880]  stratospheric when it comes to major decision makers around the world and that's been mainly
[40:13.880 --> 40:21.160]  because of you supporting us and obviously with shadow banning i had always funded more than
[40:21.160 --> 40:27.560]  15 20 groups a year covertly to not even promote us just to go out and do good work knowing that
[40:27.560 --> 40:31.640]  i see talent and someone taking action out there that doesn't have funding to go the next level
[40:31.640 --> 40:38.520]  i will provide it but thanks to all the censorship and boycotts and lawsuits i haven't really had that
[40:38.520 --> 40:45.560]  extra money to finance as many underground operations by underground i mean people that are
[40:45.560 --> 40:51.320]  prominent well known but not know that info wars is funding them but the establishment has figured
[40:51.320 --> 40:55.080]  this out and so that's why they're really trying to shut us down it's why it's more important than
[40:55.080 --> 41:01.240]  ever realize it's not just what you see here at info wars it's so many other prominent people out
[41:01.240 --> 41:05.560]  there that literally wouldn't be operating if it wasn't for your support of this transmission
[41:05.560 --> 41:11.320]  and when i say i haven't been able to do that on the scale that i used to i've actually gotten better

[46:58.840 --> 47:09.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:17.160 --> 47:23.400]  i'm here at the old baylee for the sentencing of tommy robinson today a real sense of nervousness
[47:23.400 --> 47:31.000]  of anxiety banks and banks of police officers here in their wagons the press pack is also here
[47:31.000 --> 47:37.000]  gathering and then there is a big crowd of tommy supporters also gathering down the road so
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.320]  i'm about to go and meet tommy off his train god only knows what he's thinking right now
[47:41.880 --> 47:47.960]  there is well nervousness i feel kind of a bit sick for him and i think i don't know if there was
[47:47.960 --> 47:54.760]  ever a moment that encapsulated the state versus the people i think this really must be it i do
[47:54.760 --> 47:59.720]  wonder how today's going to turn out and uh how it's going to go for tommy and whether he ends up
[47:59.720 --> 48:04.440]  inside now the democrats the deep state the globalists have been arresting people for their
[48:05.000 --> 48:12.040]  speech their anti-eu speech their anti-open borders speech in europe now they're doing it in the
[48:12.040 --> 48:18.440]  uk and tommy was convicted of journalism convicted of showing convicted pedophiles that he first
[48:18.440 --> 48:23.560]  exposed walking into the courthouse outside saying how do you feel about your sentencing
[48:24.360 --> 48:29.960]  all the other media does that to everybody else but they found him in contempt no judge
[48:29.960 --> 48:34.440]  in the u.s. previously has ever done this england's never done this europe's never done it but the
[48:34.440 --> 48:39.320]  reason you get juries is they would have obviously overridden this but tommy didn't get a jury trial
[48:39.320 --> 48:45.000]  despite the fact that uk law going back to the magna carta says more than six months you get
[48:45.000 --> 48:53.400]  a jury trial the judge has thrown you in jail you are going to get out after six months well he's
[48:53.400 --> 49:04.200]  facing nine months they starved into death last time lost almost 40 pounds now we're going to
[49:04.200 --> 49:10.680]  go to katie hobkins who is an investigative journalist in her own right and also does news
[49:10.680 --> 49:17.800]  reporting for info wars dot com she said katie hobkins still on twitter and she was there today
[49:17.800 --> 49:24.200]  that was when she intro going in she was there today when tommy wearing the shirt saying convicted
[49:24.200 --> 49:30.360]  of journalism on the front on the back the uk equals north korea she was there to break down
[49:30.360 --> 49:37.400]  what happened and how tommy took it as he had to march in to the courthouse and that was taken
[49:37.400 --> 49:45.720]  to prison and what was what was the atmosphere there like katie well you know alex i've never
[49:45.720 --> 49:50.520]  felt anything quite like it and that there was a moment where it was glorious and that sounds
[49:50.520 --> 49:56.040]  like a strange thing to say but as tommy came out of the train station where i met him surrounded by
[49:56.040 --> 50:01.960]  his volunteers that helped protect him as he goes about the place you know just this overwhelming
[50:01.960 --> 50:07.720]  mass of people who are so in support screaming his name you know the chant tommy tommy tommy
[50:07.720 --> 50:14.120]  robinson just applauding his journey from the train station to the court building about five
[50:14.120 --> 50:19.160]  minutes absolutely lined with people and you know what for a moment they're walking side by side
[50:19.160 --> 50:25.000]  with tommy just assisting him along just a real feeling that this was the best of british this
[50:25.000 --> 50:31.240]  was a moment when all the people i was surrounded by all the people i were with were just normal
[50:31.240 --> 50:35.560]  ordinary brits who want the best for their families want the best for their children
[50:35.560 --> 50:39.560]  and want to support a guy and stand up against what they know is you know really the wrong
[50:39.560 --> 50:44.280]  treatment so for a moment there there was something glorious about it but clearly that
[50:44.280 --> 50:50.760]  changed very quickly as we headed into court i went into court with tommy and sat through the
[50:50.760 --> 50:55.240]  trial with him on the other side of the press area where i was allowed to sit and there was
[50:55.240 --> 51:01.880]  something then really really dark that's where outside it was the people you know real people
[51:01.880 --> 51:08.840]  my kind of people your kind of people rust belt america people inside the establishment the wigs
[51:08.840 --> 51:15.480]  the books the rules then trying to find a bit of law that they'd like to be able to apply to a
[51:15.480 --> 51:22.200]  social media age that make no sense whatsoever you know they clearly stated there's no case law
[51:22.200 --> 51:28.360]  for sentencing for um any kind of conviction like tommy so they just had to basically make one up
[51:28.360 --> 51:35.480]  and the judge even said we need to in words to this effect we need to make an example out of tommy
[51:35.480 --> 51:40.360]  robinson so that was a very dark moment in the court and of course he says the big crime he
[51:40.360 --> 51:45.160]  committed was first along with you and others exposing 12 years ago the giant islamic child
[51:45.160 --> 51:50.360]  kidnapping rings that are being carried out on an industrial scale protected by governments all over
[51:50.360 --> 51:55.240]  the uk now they have to have these hundreds of secret trials and then you watch the islamicist
[51:55.240 --> 52:00.040]  walk in very very arrogantly insulting tommy's family threatening his family they're very very
[52:00.040 --> 52:04.760]  proud of themselves uh and and to see the criminals that have hijacked your government
[52:04.760 --> 52:12.520]  ignore your vote for brixit and now ignore your law for jury trials this is truly an alien foreign
[52:12.520 --> 52:20.920]  authoritarian tyrannical usurper government that you have yeah absolutely you know this is a thing
[52:20.920 --> 52:27.000]  that tom is really being uh banged up for he's been banged up for going against the approved thought
[52:27.000 --> 52:33.160]  he's been banged up for going against what we are allowed to say you know the government the the
[52:33.160 --> 52:39.960]  the media covers up for these majority pakistani muslim rapists by calling them uh asian men or
[52:39.960 --> 52:46.440]  for the oxford rape squad they called them men of oxford but because tommy refused to be supplicant
[52:46.440 --> 52:51.960]  to that those lies that's why he's in jail today and i could tell you standing with tommy as we were
[52:51.960 --> 52:57.240]  waiting for the judge to return to the court to give her verdict he thought he was going to get
[52:57.240 --> 53:03.640]  18 months inside that's what his team had briefed him on and there is something really stark for
[53:03.640 --> 53:09.880]  your viewers for your listeners you know watching this really kind of this this perspex box this this
[53:09.880 --> 53:15.320]  clear plastic box that they put a prisoner in before they marched them down suddenly there's a guy
[53:15.320 --> 53:21.880]  with keys jangling at his waist and tommy went into that perspex box was locked inside and then
[53:21.880 --> 53:27.560]  went down the steps as if to jail and i can tell you as a mom there is a real moment there where
[53:27.560 --> 53:33.800]  you really feel the weight and the and the gravity of of the establishment sending a man down
[53:33.800 --> 53:40.040]  literally watching him walk down the steps to jail and tommy told me there were 12 other cases
[53:40.040 --> 53:46.360]  in the old bayley today while i was there 12 murderers being charged with murder and tonight

[1:03:11.800 --> 1:03:17.240]  jail after he had avoided federal charges by agreeing to a non-prosecution agreement overseen
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:23.320]  by the florida u.s attorney's office in miami the 52 page indictment could have imprisoned him for
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:28.840]  life epstein's plea of guilt to charges of soliciting prosecution from a minor resulted in
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:35.240]  only a 13 month jail term consisting of daytime work release he was required to register as a
[1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:40.280]  sex offender and agreed to pay restitution to his victims all of this blatantly constructed to

[1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:11.400]  populated by foster careteens recruited by epstein's partner in crime jislane maxwell who also
[1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:18.280]  allegedly participated in the abuse roberts now 31 years old alleged that epstein pimped her out to

[1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:36.760]  kicked off the last few hours the president set to be addressing the group a lot of our favorite
[1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:44.840]  people like james o' keith and carpe doctrine and of course mark dice and so many others

[1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:58.680]  we've got people that are outside i fully support the president and his group not inviting info wars
[1:06:58.680 --> 1:07:03.640]  or myself or paul watson because that would become a giant distraction i told you a year ago i told
[1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:09.160]  trump don't worry about even defending me don't worry about even patting me on the head or calling
[1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:15.320]  me to events i said but defend everybody's free speech that's paramount and the president
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:21.640]  has already gone after universities that have become little north koreas where any christian
[1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:29.240]  any conservative any libertarian any pro military any pro police any pro gun any pro life is banned
[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:35.640]  hell they even have it like evergreen universities and others where they say no whites weekend led
[1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:42.120]  by weird white professors but here's trump tweeting today a big subject today at the winehouse social
[1:07:42.120 --> 1:07:49.080]  media summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by
[1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:56.440]  certain companies see it's not just censorship it's dishonesty discrimination suppression
[1:07:56.440 --> 1:08:02.520]  practiced by certain companies we will not let them get away with it much longer that's how
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:10.760]  trump does he builds his case the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period yeah
[1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:16.920]  that's at two o'clock and i'm told this is going for days in the breakaway groups and i'll just
[1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:24.120]  leave it at that but uh i have talked and my sources have talked to the highest levels of the campaign
[1:08:25.080 --> 1:08:31.320]  had dinner with the head of the campaign three times my source someone that works for info wars
[1:08:31.320 --> 1:08:36.840]  leave it that and remember there's a lot of people that work for info wars you don't know about
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:42.840]  i want to explain this this isn't about oh i'm a big shot the enemy already knows this
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:45.880]  they've got my phones tapped they're trying to move to block this it's why they're trying to choke
[1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:50.760]  the money off ladies and gentlemen it's why they work around the clock because they know
[1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:56.440]  we are the second american revolution we're a focal point for you to take action and so listen
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:09:03.400]  if i'm able to raise a few extra million dollars which sounds like a lot it's not
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:06.840]  i can guarantee with your help together
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:14.520]  you think we wrecked them in 2016 you think we've been hurting them across the board for decades
[1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:20.520]  they're ripe for defeat right now that they have no credibility people hate their guts
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:24.600]  that's why they're engaging in total censorship everywhere and just incredible crackdowns
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:30.920]  now democrats all over the news members of congress cnn msnbc saying just arrest conservatives
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:36.680]  just shut them down if they criticize anybody in government take them to jail i played those clips
[1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:44.920]  last hour new clips from cnn they won't take her carlson off the year for saying illan omar hates
[1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:52.440]  america that's all she does is piss on the country but if you'll fund us and today is a fundraising
[1:09:52.440 --> 1:10:00.120]  drive with the great products and info warshore dot com i guarantee you in the position info wars has
[1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:10.680]  gotten into there have been cases in world war two and then again in uh korea where the marines
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:17.080]  got completely surrounded in korea by a couple million shining strips and the marine corps
[1:10:17.080 --> 1:10:21.400]  generally said sir we're completely surrounded and he said good we can attack in all directions
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:28.200]  that wasn't a joke when when you've got human wave attacks coming from every direction all you
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:33.080]  got to do is have c 130's fly over and drop munitions and you can just keep fighting and
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:39.080]  just mow the enemy down like 300 at gallipoli that's a true story so politically it's the
[1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:44.200]  same position there was a case in the battle of the bulge in world war two where uh several
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:51.400]  nazi divisions of tanks were coming in against fresh uh u.s troops i mean they'd been in combat for
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:57.240]  a month or so but they were fresh compared to the young german recruits hitler youth and others the
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:02.680]  average age was about 16 so they had big old giant super tanks and stuff out of like science fiction
[1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:07.240]  movies rolling up against our little buddy tanks and weapons but we had all the farm boys and

[1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:46.680]  you know who you're who the info wars auxiliary people are basically almost anybody you talk about
[1:20:46.680 --> 1:20:55.720]  because we have the audience that is patriotic that's christian that's hardcore that's midwestern
[1:20:55.720 --> 1:21:02.040]  that's southern and that are the very best people in the northeast and out west we have the patriots
[1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:06.840]  and we have the demographics of folks that are serious and other history and they understand
[1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:15.000]  that info wars delivers and so and they understand that other people don't know how to go out and get
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.880]  money they don't know how to go out and build an operation they don't know how to go out and

[1:21:34.840 --> 1:21:40.280]  selling hundreds and thousands of products over the years that you can find yourself and all you
[1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:47.320]  gotta do is sell a good product so people like it make sure they get service and then they're
[1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:53.640]  going to want to ideologically buy from you to build your media operation and it's that model
[1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:58.600]  so i'm gonna talk about myself here it's this model at the highest levels that the globalists
[1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:03.080]  want to shut down because if nationalists and conservatives and christians and patriots and
[1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:07.640]  gun owners and just libertarians and folks that want to be left alone common sense people
[1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:14.440]  if we ever start creating our own communities and if we ever start shopping with people that are on
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:22.040]  our side and pool our resources we are the builders we're the fighters we're black we're white we're

[1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:58.120]  this news but i hate saying please go buy our products and doing the hard sell but this weekend
[1:23:58.120 --> 1:24:05.480]  it really hit me i got really excited i've started swimming again and i was about a half mile into
[1:24:05.480 --> 1:24:12.760]  a little swim in the lake in the early morning the sun was coming up over the hills and i was swimming
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:17.400]  and it was just like man you've got all these people want to work for you you've got all these
[1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:21.160]  people that are already incredibly successful calling you up constantly asking what should they
[1:24:21.160 --> 1:24:25.320]  do what do you think about this what do you think about that you've already covertly funded over
[1:24:25.320 --> 1:24:30.040]  the years over a hundred people some of which you've had to stop funding because you've just
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:34.680]  erupt they're talking about keep info wars on the air we're in a fight don't let them win explain
[1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:41.160]  to people what you really have done and more importantly it hit me what they've done do you
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:46.040]  understand i don't just get up here to a station owner or the station manager and thank them i mean
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:49.560]  it from the bottom of my heart because all i want to do is resist the globalists because they want
[1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:55.160]  to enslave me they want to enslave my family and your family it's not some heroic goody two shoes
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:25:02.760]  things they are trying to dominate us how is it some wonderful altruistic thing that i want to get
[1:25:02.760 --> 1:25:12.680]  up and kick their ass no it's just normal to stand up and say no as a man but see people that serve
[1:25:12.680 --> 1:25:16.760]  evil they get intimidated by the system they care about the world system because they're of the
[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:23.720]  world system and the first thing i'll tell you god hates is a coward but god loves people that have
[1:25:23.720 --> 1:25:30.120]  courage and i know this audience has great courage because you're activists you're the
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:35.000]  opposite of an audience you are the people in the arena so there's no amount of hype
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:39.640]  they can go into how thankful i am to a matt drudge or how thankful i am to a local station that's
[1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:44.760]  carried us in some cases 15 20 years despite all the attacks and all the boycotts and all the crap
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:50.600]  and you the listeners because we've really done something special here and the world
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:54.920]  is getting a second chance against world government and the casual society and all these
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:26:01.320]  things that are out in the open now because for decades they tried to deny all this was happening
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:09.720]  now they can't deny any of it so instead they try to shut us down so we can't say hey we were
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:14.760]  right we don't want this so i'm not going to plug any more this hour i'm going to come back and give

[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:54.680]  we can get into all of it and so much more today eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three
[1:26:54.680 --> 1:27:01.080]  nine eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine and then we do have a special guest
[1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:06.680]  joining us i'll tell you about what she i think she's the smartest and then one of the best people
[1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:11.240]  on blaze tv she had the courage to have me on so that lady's gonna be joining us i'll tell you
[1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:16.680]  about her next segment coming up and then i'm going to go ahead matt bracken loves it he loves
[1:27:16.680 --> 1:27:21.080]  the host the fourth hour he understands when i'm bumping i'm going to go ahead and have
[1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:26.760]  least ran a hand on because he's done a lot of research into jeffrey epstein a lot of research
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:33.160]  into alan dershowitz and i've done a lot of research and and i don't know if dershowitz is is is
[1:27:33.160 --> 1:27:40.920]  innocent or not um and you know there's also been some developments uh where
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:50.520]  different folks have said one thing about what caused the arrest of um epstein this last week
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:57.160]  versus what really did it so i just really want to kind of a brainstorm here on air
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:02.360]  for the listeners as well what do you think's going on where does this rabbit hole go because
[1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:06.360]  we know it's the democrats we know it's bill clinton but all we keep hearing is trump even
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:10.520]  though in all these documents there's nothing about trump remember darshowitz who live thoughts
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:17.640]  have been you innocent in this even though he's a democrat you know he's sued to get the documents
[1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:23.160]  some of these documents released that show he's not in them but then later people are saying he's
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:29.960]  in them so i'm not saying alan dershowitz is is is is is guilty i'm seeing inculter saying
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:34.840]  he looks suspicious i'm seeing kind of this gang up on alan dershowitz thing i want to try to really
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:39.800]  find out what's going on and i've invited some of the different parties on from different angles
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:46.760]  and some of the parties don't want to come on like uh michael sternovich like sternovich because
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:51.240]  you know he was involved in the lawsuit to get this out the lawsuit uh of one of the reported
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:56.200]  victims was a lot of them are fake i'm not saying she's fake it's probably real but but we'll talk
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:29:01.160]  about it all hi i'm dan pilla i started fighting the irs over 40 years ago when they tried to

[1:32:10.920 --> 1:32:18.120]  mean we go conquer countries it means our superior western values of true freedom get adopted because
[1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:24.440]  compared to globalism it's night and day we're going to do a 34 hour special broadcast
[1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:30.680]  that kicks off this thursday morning at 8 a.m with david night runs right through with me and many
[1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:37.320]  others till the next day at 6 p.m on the war room we're going to have our crew in dc at the white
[1:32:37.320 --> 1:32:42.920]  house summit on social media we're going to be at the after party with all the key folks taking action
[1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:48.600]  against censorship and so much more so everybody share that link info wars.com forward slash show
[1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:57.320]  kicking off this thursday at 8 a.m central at info wars.com forward slash show 1776 worldwide
[1:32:57.320 --> 1:33:08.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:40.920]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[1:33:44.600 --> 1:33:47.720]  by the way i said last segment i wasn't going to plug anymore this hour and i'm not about to go
[1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:52.200]  right to your phone calls and all the news and all the clips i was thinking about the
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:34:03.880]  headlines i've seen the last few months where buzzfeed and other groups like vox vox gets 200
[1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:14.360]  something million a year just from george soros and others and from nbc and daily beast gets
[1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:22.520]  something like 400 million dollars a year and so does buzzfeed 400 million dollars a year
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:31.000]  we'll do something like sell 30 million dollars a product have 15 million dollars pay for all the
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  bandwidth pay for all the crew pay for all the insurance pay for all the travel and then there's
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:42.200]  like three four million dollars left and it's all for legal fees and taxes and crap which is fine
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:50.440]  because i don't measure things by how much money i make but most smart bombs most missiles cost a
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:35:00.520]  couple million dollars so for the cost of a couple smart bombs i know we could have devastating
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:05.720]  effects on the globalist and get around their censorship and their election meddling that's
[1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:13.320]  what i'm saying get your war bonds at m4store.com because you can pull it up where again mbc gave
[1:35:13.320 --> 1:35:19.480]  200 million dollars to vox and then vox goes around calling for everybody to be taken off the
[1:35:19.480 --> 1:35:25.000]  air and when vox snaps their fingers youtube and google say yes sir and they take action
[1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:33.160]  so we're having a fundraiser today buy the great products oh yeah 400 million from disney
[1:35:33.160 --> 1:35:39.720]  put into vice which promotes pedophilia at the end of the family and arresting trump so i'm saying
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:47.880]  they're putting buh buh buh buh billions into these organizations and they can't even get the
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:53.720]  audience we have even when we've been blacklisted that's important so thanks for standing with us
[1:35:53.720 --> 1:36:00.600]  it's a true david versus goliath scenario 1776 34 hour emergency broadcast that's
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:06.760]  taking place right through tomorrow at 6 p.m. central we'll have live coverage of the event coming up
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:15.480]  at the white house it's already kicked off but the two or so trumps set to give a speech

[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:42.200]  then what really got the feds to bust eppstein again we'll be fleshing all of that out uh coming

[1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:39.320]  another caller in canada this time in canada michael in canada you're on the air welcome
[1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:48.280]  hey alex hey michael thank you i'm just wondering um we've always heard about the mark of the beast
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:55.160]  and i'm just wondering if uh the mark is actually the implant or if it's our smartphones well if
[1:37:55.160 --> 1:38:00.360]  you really read revelations it's very clear daniel and azikio it's all clear it's a world system
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:06.680]  that you support and you love and it's a way of life and it tells you how to live and then if you
[1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:14.040]  don't have the mark of the beast and of its system then you can't buy and sell so you behave away
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:20.760]  so that you'll be given the chinese social score you'll be given the mark so the mark is subservience
[1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:25.800]  to the antichrist subservience to the one world government and then you're given the digital mark
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:34.200]  in your palm or in your forehead chinese social credit score sir it's here they're already saying
[1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:38.920]  you cannot say my name or info wars in a positive light you can only say it negative and then facebook
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:45.320]  went further and said you can call for my death and organize my murder and i believe the canadian
[1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:52.120]  government is using facebook groups to go after conservatives canada is one of the most authoritarian
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:57.640]  nations in the world now and the people are just sleepwalking into oblivion i agree and we're too
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:06.360]  collate we we we are the frogs in the pot you're absolutely right uh where do you think all this
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:15.240]  is going michael i don't know i think unless something major happens um to uh tick off a lot
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:21.320]  of canadians um nothing's gonna happen but a lot of canadians aren't getting ticked off because the
[1:39:21.320 --> 1:39:28.040]  news up here is so controlled because our government gives them multi-million dollars to
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:33.320]  say what they want them to say and hide what is actually going on
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:41.880]  exactly you've got a new ruling class who will do anything at any time but they're all
[1:39:41.880 --> 1:39:50.280]  anti-human anti-family they believe a post-human world is coming and they want to sell us on that
[1:39:50.280 --> 1:39:54.920]  idea of an apocalypse so that we basically give up and don't try to build a better world
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:59.560]  because they've been told by this dark entity that if they take over and get rid of the humans
[1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:04.040]  they'll be allowed to merge with the gods and become eternal they don't know that they're
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:08.280]  more advanced and more powerful than satan it's just that satan's older and is playing tricks on
[1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:14.440]  them we're like babies satan is ancient and is setting these people up michael great point thank
[1:40:14.440 --> 1:40:19.640]  you so much for calling we're going to talk to folks in florida now we're going to talk to jason
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:24.440]  in florida uh jason thanks for calling in what's your view on the situation how should
[1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:30.120]  truck take action go ahead first of all i'd like to plug products uh my son and i are both big
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:36.760]  super blue fans my son also takes the honor roll which the fantastic product originally they wanted
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:43.000]  to test him for adhd well that wasn't the case at all he's just a really smart kid so the honor roll
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:48.760]  product amazing amazing results from that product mr jones thank you very much for every
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:54.040]  since you raise it it's it's doing our research with top companies it's one of the highest rated
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:59.400]  blends of fish oil particularly with small caplets for children and it's had the mercury
[1:40:59.400 --> 1:41:03.640]  taken out of it and they found that it's really a missing link and a lot of young people's brains
[1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:09.160]  what effect did it have i actually allowed him to focus um as a five-year-old kid he was having
[1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:13.640]  a little trouble staying in his seat and things like that and uh you know i feed him well he
[1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:19.560]  exercises we swim every day and things like that but the reality is i just think his diet was missing
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:24.760]  something that over the last year of using the honor roll product off the chart he's testing
[1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:30.280]  in the top percentages of his class and it's just people are beside themselves and and you know i
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:35.240]  swear by the product i wouldn't turn him away from it he even tells me every morning he doesn't have it
[1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:40.760]  daddy i just don't feel as well as i did the other day and i think a lot of it has to do with
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:46.680]  the young developing mind and body and without the you know the product i will say that on my own
[1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:51.160]  personal experience i will say these products work and that i thank you and my son also thank
[1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:57.000]  you for him as well well jason thank you for your support good clean fish oil or krill oil
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.080]  there's nothing better i mean with my own children one of my daughters you can kind of get up low
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:05.160]  blood sugar be a little bit grumpy get her to eat some basic food then she's not grumpy but when she
[1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:09.560]  takes her fish oil she goes daddy i feel so much better after i take it i'm like absolutely so thank
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:14.840]  you jason uh what's your take on the next move for big tech all right here we go i'm going to knock
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:19.640]  this out of the park real quick for you info warriors and let you know that google and apple
[1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:24.840]  have both stepped into the education systems as we all know none of us are strangers to it my son's
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:29.400]  school has eliminated all textbooks at this point and everything that the children do from the time
[1:42:29.400 --> 1:42:34.760]  they're in kindergarten to the time they graduate from the school they will actually never have picked
[1:42:34.760 --> 1:42:39.640]  up a textbook in their life if we google a few definitions real quick mr jones i will tell you
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:44.040]  exactly stay there you are knocking out of the park jason you're an awesome caller let's come back
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:47.960]  to you right on the other side then we'll go to everybody else but yeah once you get rid of textbooks
[1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:53.320]  and books and paper then they can change history whenever they want even faster and you see that
[1:42:53.320 --> 1:42:58.840]  happening now with these different systems they have we'll be right back as we gather this evening
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:06.200]  in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage together we are
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:13.640]  part of one of the greatest stories ever told the story of america it is the epic tale of a great
[1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:20.200]  nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:28.440]  as long as we stay true to our coast as long as we remember our great history as long as we
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:44.360]  never ever stop fighting for a better future then there will be nothing that america cannot do
[1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:52.760]  in full wars dot com tomorrow's news today full power the republic in the name of jesus christ
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:44:00.040]  full power damn the torpedoes go straight at them it's not only that you have a unique voice in the
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:04.840]  public arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only
[1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:09.560]  network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's
[1:44:09.560 --> 1:44:14.360]  not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secret foreign government it is completely
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:20.120]  independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the
[1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:24.520]  freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:29.320]  beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[1:44:29.320 --> 1:44:33.000]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:37.320]  they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:42.600]  control and manipulate what news it views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:47.720]  the info wars audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:52.040]  modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:56.520]  onslaught of the black warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth
[1:44:59.080 --> 1:45:05.800]  info wars the most banned network in the world so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:10.360]  self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:15.480]  together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent press of
[1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:21.000]  this size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says here's a way to have a
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:26.280]  self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure that because the
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:30.680]  audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:35.000]  reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:39.160]  whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and
[1:45:39.160 --> 1:45:43.240]  that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do
[1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:48.440]  that and at the same time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what
[1:45:48.440 --> 1:45:52.840]  news they want to see and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:57.640]  expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets

[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:23.240]  welcome back folks alex jones here we're talking to jason in florida you said the next move for
[1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:29.720]  big tech google facebook please start over sir go ahead what i think is going on right now alex
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:33.640]  is they've managed to take the textbooks out of the classrooms and what i like to call it ever
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:39.400]  changing definitions and i'll i'll go ahead and let you know how this works what we've done right
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:44.280]  now is the left has actually managed to create a mindless group of individuals that feels that
[1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:49.880]  words are violent you can see that now if you've taken google the definition of the word hate speech
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:56.200]  with that hate speech you can now confuse people into thinking that words are violent
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:48:04.600]  therefore any word that physically hurts someone can then be called a hate cry that hate crime if
[1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:09.240]  you definitely google that definition you can go ahead and link that to what they're doing to you
[1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:15.800]  right now mr jones which is the definition by google of terrorism sir what they are doing
[1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:22.840]  is turning your word into physical violence which then means the act of physical violence in order
[1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:30.040]  to change someone's political ideology is the definition by google of terrorism what the president
[1:48:30.040 --> 1:48:36.280]  needs to do mr jones and i know you're going to push it pull their section 230 they are committed
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:43.880]  an act of conspiracy to commit against alex jones paul joseph watson laura lumar every one of you
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:51.400]  that's been banned they are now saying that it's acceptable and tolerable to organize against you
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:57.480]  or to commit acts of violence against you that because of their 230 immunity they don't get in
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:05.000]  any trouble strip it mr jones and we will see that they are liable for any and all damages
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:11.480]  or acts of violence that are done against you or any other individual that they deem is politically
[1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:19.640]  incorrect or jeopardizes the harmonious way that their community is preserved well jason you've
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:23.560]  you've totally defined this perfectly and they admit that's what they're doing and then to have
[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:28.360]  facebook come out and say anyone listed as a dangerous person you're allowed to organize
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:34.760]  their murder or their violent end they pulled that but i'll talk to robert barnes other lawyers
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:38.840]  that are on top of it they said clearly that's a test by facebook to see what we would do if this
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:44.760]  is getting crazy absolutely and it's not going to stop they've indoctrinated our schools now
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:50.040]  mr jones like you said they've got every kid's got a chromebook my son's in kindergarten he has a
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:55.560]  take-home chromebook let's remember this they're tracking everything they got a profile on your
[1:49:55.560 --> 1:50:01.000]  son and they are tracking everything he ever writes or ever does and facebook says in the future
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:06.280]  even when we change the rules of political correctness if you violated our rules
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:11.960]  in the past if you wrote 30 years ago there's only two genders you will be punished in the future

[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:08.120]  information warfare like bullets but nonviolent and whole clips whole magazines just jam full of
[1:57:08.120 --> 1:57:13.560]  people that have already been super successful who with a little bit of amplification will blow holes

[1:58:52.200 --> 1:58:56.840]  say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and
[1:58:56.840 --> 1:59:01.560]  one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons
[1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:06.360]  are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that
[1:59:06.360 --> 1:59:11.320]  they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys
[1:59:11.320 --> 1:59:14.760]  into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other
[1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:18.760]  than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:23.080]  want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived

[1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:33.000]  about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:37.800]  battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue we're

[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:51.240]  now he was obviously protected uh my my issue is is that there's no evidence trump is anywhere
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:56.040]  connected to it if trump was connected i would expose it all i see is bill clinton and democrats
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:01:02.040]  connected what do you think well given that every story has mentioned that james komie's
[2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:06.840]  daughter's in charge of this and given that polosi's daughter came out and announced it
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:15.800]  that's the signal to the left that they're not at risk here it's like when obama closed car
[2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:20.760]  dealerships that were owned by conservatives but not liberals this is going to be a selective
[2:01:20.760 --> 2:01:28.360]  targeting of republicans that have enabled trump to do what he's done now think about who jeffrey
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:35.320]  eppstein is he's a banker how many pervert bankers are there democrat or republican that have
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:39.880]  gone to that guy's island that they have a black book on they're gonna target just them not any
[2:01:39.880 --> 2:01:44.680]  democrats they're gonna they're gonna turn a blind eye to anything that makes any democrat or any
[2:01:44.680 --> 2:01:50.840]  democrat they don't like um look that they're gonna target republicans is that no i think you're
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:55.720]  right we're all we're all we're all cheering this on there's no connection to trump they're
[2:01:55.720 --> 2:02:02.920]  still going with it and so so we're saying it's a selective prosecution if they can take out the
[2:02:02.920 --> 2:02:07.560]  bankers that have helped trump to run the economy if they can crash the economy that's what they
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:11.480]  want to do they want to cause a right that's what they're hoping to come out of this family
[2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:17.160]  oh exactly he's a huge international banker he's had all these guests and they can implicate them
[2:02:17.160 --> 2:02:22.920]  they'll they'll leave trump and won't support the economy right as trump says last week the biggest
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:28.680]  threat to what we're doing is the private fellow reserve that's what i'm worried about sir well
[2:02:28.680 --> 2:02:34.280]  your smart caller that's why i take calls i will expand on that jim because yeah polosi's daughter
[2:02:34.280 --> 2:02:40.360]  came out and said some of our favorite people are going to be implicated but that's covered that's
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:45.480]  pretend that's pretend talk they know it's not going to happen but this was passed you got to
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:49.400]  know that bill clinton and hillary gave a thumbs up to this before they ever went ahead with it
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:54.680]  jeffrey epstein knew what he was doing he came back into the lay down he's a so you're saying this
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:03:00.680]  is going to be the revenge inside of the democratic party in the justice department uh knowing that
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:05.720]  epstein has a list of some republicans he was able to compromise i i agree with you i think that's
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:11.080]  where this is going and i think it's going to be impossible for them to only burn their own people
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:15.160]  when it's mainly democrats doing it i think it's a threat to trump i think he calls their bluff
[2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:19.960]  but i think you're right thank you jim one hell of a time to be alive carlos in canada
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:27.000]  carlos you're on the air go ahead yes thank you very much alec um just the first of a point of
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:32.920]  information and the second is probably the most important uh item that i will ever cover on any
[2:03:32.920 --> 2:03:40.840]  my phone calls to you um it's very very important um but in november uh 2018 the miami herald as you
[2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:48.920]  know published a new investigation into epstein's alleged child sex trafficking ring and it prompted
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:56.520]  the federal investigators and uh to validate the agreement not to prosecute and at this time uh
[2:03:56.520 --> 2:04:03.560]  shortly after a month later uh they were ready to move on epstein coincidentally on january the
[2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:10.680]  fifth 2019 a few days later the temple which was built in sin james a little sin james island
[2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:17.160]  orgy island uh completely burned down and you know carlos you've been calling for a long time
[2:04:17.160 --> 2:04:23.480]  and i forgot about orgy island burning down we've got lee strana hand on in the fourth hour give us

[2:08:04.840 --> 2:08:10.520]  also want to talk about tomi robinson the persecution of the press cnn hosting we need to do away with
[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:16.360]  talk radio members of congress saying arrest people that criticize democrats i mean wow this
[2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:24.520]  is like we're living in the beginning phases of the novel 1984 thanks for coming on for sure thanks
[2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:28.520]  for having me and you're absolutely right this is orwellian in every sense of the word and i
[2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:33.080]  think if you would have told me where things are going to be right now i don't know five years ago
[2:08:33.080 --> 2:08:38.040]  i don't think i would have believed you well i watch your show it was great being on your show
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:42.920]  you're really an expert on this lay into it of where you think we're going what trump needs to do
[2:08:42.920 --> 2:08:49.240]  just just just your you know your top points sure well right now we're at a point where all the big
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:54.760]  social media platforms of talking facebook twitter youtube and above youtube just google in general
[2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:59.880]  with their search results and not to mention pinterest i wouldn't know consider it a major
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:06.040]  platform but it's part of this too they're kind of surreptitiously they have been trying to derank
[2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:11.480]  deboose and hide any content that's even remotely conservative or pro trump and you might even go
[2:09:11.480 --> 2:09:16.760]  further than that and say maybe not pro trump or conservative but just anti far left progressivism
[2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:21.160]  so they've been very successful about this i know you guys have encountered it um if conservative
[2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:25.640]  commentators aren't outright banned they're facing shadow banning their um videos aren't
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:30.520]  being recommended views are dropping among political commentators that i know on youtube to
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:36.520]  maybe just 10 or 16 percent in some cases of what they used to be and this is all i think gearing up
[2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:42.920]  for the 2020 election right i mean these people they are far left ideologs um they're pretty open
[2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:47.960]  about it i think and as the project veritas tapes have seen if anyone hasn't seen them yet i really
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:53.160]  recommend you check it out um they do think they have the responsibility these silicon valley tech
[2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:58.360]  giants to make sure that trump doesn't get elected again so that's why since 2016 they've been trying
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:02.760]  to work on all of these ways to make sure that any trump supporters or any information that
[2:10:02.760 --> 2:10:08.840]  might sway voters opinions to be more supportive of him um that content doesn't spread uh it's
[2:10:08.840 --> 2:10:13.240]  it's very concerning we've known it's been happening for a while but it's only just recently
[2:10:13.240 --> 2:10:17.160]  that the president i think has given it the attention that it deserves i applaud him having
[2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:22.760]  the summit i hope though that this is just the beginning and that eventually there is actual
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:28.920]  concrete action taken against these companies when i saw this two nights ago i didn't believe it
[2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:33.160]  at first so i actually went to facebook's terms of service took like five minutes to find it
[2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:37.960]  and they changed it to say you can engage in threats that cause death or bodily harm if
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:43.160]  someone is a dangerous person well that definition is reserved for myself paul watson
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:50.360]  mylo yanopoulos uh and gab mcginnis and a few others and it was actually an invocation for terror
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:55.080]  they already said don't say my name unless it's negative but it's so orwellian i was pinching
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:10:59.880]  myself that they're issuing fatta was on ourselves so i think that shows us where they're going
[2:11:00.760 --> 2:11:08.040]  if action isn't taken i think it shows a real megalomania uh inside big tech and it's so strange
[2:11:08.040 --> 2:11:12.520]  i i didn't believe that new update when i saw it when i heard of it either actually had to check
[2:11:12.520 --> 2:11:17.160]  it out for myself like you did because i think if there's one and we talked about this on when
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:21.640]  you're on my show if there's one thing that i think most people even those who are for free
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:27.560]  speech agree on that is okay to be moderated it's actual violent threats right that's kind of like
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:32.920]  the the one thing that everybody oh yeah section 230 says if a site doesn't allow poor no poor no
[2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:37.960]  gambling and no calls for violence and that's that's in section 230 that you can take that down
[2:11:37.960 --> 2:11:42.360]  so it's exactly they're violating section 230 now in an actual aggressive way
[2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:49.320]  saying we we go past you know saying we're not just moderators that we're publishers now
[2:11:49.320 --> 2:11:56.120]  but we're we're gonna call for violent activism and i think you can't look at this
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:12:01.560]  this new measure and not see how it's a blatant double standard right because conservatives
[2:12:01.560 --> 2:12:06.440]  for a while we've seen how uh there's this thing called verified hate people collect
[2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:11.480]  all of the awful things that some of the left-wing verified twitter users say or you know even post
[2:12:11.480 --> 2:12:16.680]  on facebook and it's not touched it's not removed but if you're someone who has i guess less popular
[2:12:16.680 --> 2:12:21.880]  politics for these silicon valley people um you're gonna come under fire this new terms of service
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:26.920]  update is essentially just i guess codifying what we've known for a long time there are certain
[2:12:26.920 --> 2:12:31.720]  people where you're totally fine to make threats against and nothing will happen to you it's just
[2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:35.640]  it's pretty shocking it's very bold of them to make these kind of updates especially with all
[2:12:35.640 --> 2:12:41.080]  the scrutiny they're under right now i'm just i'm very very much looking forward to seeing what's
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:45.640]  going to be done about this people have mentioned things like maybe antitrust breaking up companies
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:49.720]  like facebook and google some people say that's not enough we need to hold them liable under
[2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:55.480]  230 to civil suits um you know being accountable for things like defamation and whatnot um will
[2:12:55.480 --> 2:12:59.480]  chamberlain who who's talks about this a lot he thinks that platform access would be should be
[2:12:59.480 --> 2:13:04.440]  considered as civil rights there are a lot of different avenues we could take to fix this problem
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:10.440]  i'm interested to see what the president is going to choose to focus on i told you what you said
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:17.000]  it's it's dead on the other part of the equation is the fake libertarian coke brothers foundations
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:22.280]  are going to say hey it's their own company these companies facebook apple google they've
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:28.760]  bought thousands of companies they buy everything up facebook bought whatsapp and then said we're
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:33.400]  going to take alge jones off that if he's using it so i can't instant message private people
[2:13:33.960 --> 2:13:38.280]  this is like the phone company breaking it on your phone so they are giant monopolies working
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:43.720]  together that's cartels and they are a clear and present danger i just wonder why do you
[2:13:43.720 --> 2:13:48.600]  think they're so arrogant and think they're invincible well i think because for the longest
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:53.560]  time they have been right i mean these silicon valley tech giants they've escaped with if you
[2:13:53.560 --> 2:13:57.880]  think about like e-commerce that they engage in how google runs their ads or their search results
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:02.920]  they deal with clients every day and they're one of the least regulated like industries that i can
[2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:07.800]  think of right because every type of service industry is regulated i mean food retail what
[2:14:07.800 --> 2:14:12.200]  have you there are tons of government regulations on all of these businesses but silicon valley these
[2:14:12.200 --> 2:14:18.360]  tech giants have escaped largely untouched why is that because they serve more customers or deal
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:22.920]  with more people than it almost any other industry everybody's on facebook and youtube they deal with
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:27.480]  a lot more cash inflow than all of these other industries so what makes them so special i think
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:33.320]  it's because for a long time they have been investing money in lobbying to keep these i mean
[2:14:33.320 --> 2:14:38.280]  congress and whatnot off of their back and they've been successful about it i'm hoping that we're
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:43.480]  finally at a point where people like trump the outsiders who are now in power can finally do
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:48.360]  something about it because like i i don't like government regulation i small government minded
[2:14:48.360 --> 2:14:53.080]  person but there comes a point where you have to wonder why they get such special treatment right
[2:14:53.080 --> 2:14:57.400]  because it's not i'm not just saying like oh yeah let's just burden the tech sector with
[2:14:57.400 --> 2:15:01.400]  well listen you're totally right quality they're already bigger than most governments they're
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:09.800]  engaging in criminal activity i'm for free market uh but i do not support uh having the mafia because
[2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:13.800]  they call themselves free market come and burn down my grocery store if i don't pay them protection
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:19.720]  money or not let me have a cement company in new jersey so so this is just criminal activity and
[2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:24.920]  plus the big tech companies had cia funding nsa funding a lot of government bureaucrats got invested
[2:15:24.920 --> 2:15:29.240]  in them and so that's why there's this sick relationship it's an abuse of power it's out of
[2:15:29.240 --> 2:15:33.720]  control they sold out to the chai comms the eu and others and that's why they've got to come down
[2:15:33.720 --> 2:15:39.640]  when we come back i want to ask you what you think's coming next what else you think trump should do
[2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:43.880]  and then what you think about the persecution of the press not just here but around the world

[2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:49.960]  journalism that's the headline we put out monday convicted of journalism on the back the uk equals
[2:20:49.960 --> 2:20:57.240]  north korea loren shinn again as our guest uh without even trying i have she and in today
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:21:04.120]  saying do away with talk radio just ban all conservative media and then we have uh the congress
[2:21:04.120 --> 2:21:13.880]  woman uh famously uh in florida just last week saying arrest anybody that criticizes democrats
[2:21:13.880 --> 2:21:25.000]  here it is those people who are online making fun of members of congress are this grace and
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:32.040]  there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable we're going to shut them down
[2:21:32.040 --> 2:21:39.400]  and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted friend rica wilson uh you
[2:21:39.400 --> 2:21:45.480]  know tipper gore was a democrat but you know she didn't want 10 year olds to be sold lyrics by two
[2:21:45.480 --> 2:21:51.720]  live crew that were pretty nasty but i'm still saying hey that's up to parents to control that i
[2:21:51.720 --> 2:21:57.240]  don't want the state involvement censorship because next it's me but now they're just out in the open
[2:21:57.240 --> 2:22:04.680]  sans censor everybody whenever they want it's so draconian it's so dangerous it's so scary
[2:22:06.040 --> 2:22:10.680]  loren shinn why do you think they're coming out of the closet like this everywhere i think it's
[2:22:10.680 --> 2:22:16.440]  because they really intend just like europe's done to ban speech i mean tommy robinson exposed huge
[2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:22.200]  rape gangs was beaten up attacked dozens of times put in prison the guys a hero snow jury
[2:22:22.200 --> 2:22:28.600]  trials sit back to prison for talking about convicted child pedophiles well i think right now
[2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:33.000]  if we look at what's happening with the left essentially going off the rails and advocating
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:37.160]  full-on for censorship they're not even hiding it it's not doggles is any whistles anymore
[2:22:37.160 --> 2:22:41.800]  they're coming out and saying no let's just ban these people they're right to voice their opinions
[2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:45.960]  for the longest time the media establishment media and establishment politicians have kind
[2:22:45.960 --> 2:22:50.760]  of fed each other right they've controlled the narrative entirely and what's happened now with
[2:22:50.760 --> 2:22:55.640]  platforms like yours with other independent outlets i'd like to think the blaze is part
[2:22:55.640 --> 2:23:00.360]  of that as am i um they no longer have that control anymore right they don't get to decide
[2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:05.240]  what stories we talk about what we report on and as we saw with the 2016 election that has real
[2:23:05.240 --> 2:23:10.200]  world consequences right i mean it's i think it's it would be naive to think that you know for
[2:23:10.200 --> 2:23:14.760]  example people my age that we all just are naturally inclined to be far left progressives no it's
[2:23:14.760 --> 2:23:19.640]  because that's the the line the narrative that we've been fed for the longest time so when
[2:23:19.640 --> 2:23:23.960]  independent media outlets or conservative commentators started chipping away at that and their
[2:23:23.960 --> 2:23:28.760]  control that they've had they essentially freaked out for lack of a better term and this is their
[2:23:28.760 --> 2:23:32.920]  attempt to kind of regain that control that's why we see places like facebook youtube they're
[2:23:32.920 --> 2:23:38.360]  really cramping down on these people and i think people like uh the congresswoman you just saw
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:44.680]  cannot believe that's not parody super scary um they're at a point where they're not even afraid
[2:23:44.680 --> 2:23:48.760]  to advocate for banning it because they've managed to frame this whole conversation not as
[2:23:48.760 --> 2:23:52.600]  you know free speech is bad we're afraid of the control we're losing no to them it's like oh no
[2:23:52.600 --> 2:23:57.480]  we're just we're trying to ban hate speech just these bad people who have dangerous opinions
[2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:04.040]  no no one wants to support literal nazis right okay and the very same people have done it exactly
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:08.920]  the very same people doing this are the ones going trump's waging war on the press he wants to arrest
[2:24:08.920 --> 2:24:14.120]  us he wants to kill us no he's made them more money in ratings than ever he's never called them to be
[2:24:14.120 --> 2:24:20.360]  shut down he just responds to their lies and they call that a war on the press when meanwhile
[2:24:20.360 --> 2:24:24.920]  they're saying shut down free speech that's a war on the first amendment not just the press
[2:24:26.200 --> 2:24:31.480]  no you're absolutely right and it's funny if trump to treated the mainstream media the way
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:36.440]  that silicon valley treats establishment media um they would absolutely lose their minds they don't
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:40.440]  even know what it is to try to be silenced they think getting your press pass taken away from
[2:24:40.440 --> 2:24:45.080]  you is a violation of their first amendment rights i mean there's a blatant double standard here
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:24:50.360]  that they're employing and they're not even ashamed of it how far do you think they'll go do they have
[2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:56.840]  any bottom because i've seen a few cases lately where they've told huge whoppers and some of the
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:25:03.160]  media here's an example uh they had some headlines saying nobody showed up at trump's event at the
[2:25:03.160 --> 2:25:09.800]  fourth of july later a few media outlets said to say okay uh you know we were wrong uh they they put
[2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:15.400]  out fake news headlines that i lost a lawsuit for sandy hook for a book i never wrote that i wasn't
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:20.520]  in and then i sent child porn to people which i didn't a bunch of people retracted some didn't
[2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:25.400]  but but there's got to be some low point there's got to be a bottom is there a bottom to as you said
[2:25:25.960 --> 2:25:30.920]  the hysteria of the left who was so arrogant thought they were invincible and found out they've
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:37.080]  lost uh mostly young people i used to think there was i hope that there was but i think like a lot
[2:25:37.080 --> 2:25:42.760]  of people the whole fiasco with covington catholic really opened my eyes about the depth that people
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:47.000]  these people are willing to stoop to in order to push their agenda they were the footage was always
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:52.760]  available of what happened that day and how um i think his name is nick sandman if i'm not mistaken
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:57.000]  was just standing there and someone came to confront him not the other way around that footage was
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:02.440]  always there from from day one the moment that story broke um either these people these journalists
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:07.560]  were too lazy or they just didn't care enough to look but uh since then no i there's i don't give
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:11.000]  them any benefit of the doubt because i don't think they've earned that i think they're willing
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:15.320]  to do whatever it takes to get control back i mean uh you know being an online commentator
[2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:20.280]  commentator i see the way that they smear people that that i i've worked with i consider friends
[2:26:20.280 --> 2:26:24.920]  i'm you know gavin mckinnis tommy robinson the lies that they tell about these people it really
[2:26:24.920 --> 2:26:30.040]  shocks you i'm at a point now where i mean when i hear the media and this is awful to admit but
[2:26:30.040 --> 2:26:35.800]  when i hear the media call someone a right wing extremist unfortunately my first response my
[2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:42.600]  first instinct is oh they're probably a reasonable person how how dystopian is that well you're right
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:47.800]  they've had like 26 women say that trump raped them always in a public place with no witnesses
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:53.800]  but we come back i've got a clip of a lady that said he kissed her on the lips aggressively it's
[2:26:53.800 --> 2:27:00.280]  her trying to kiss him he kisses her back a little trump's a germaphobe he doesn't like doing that uh
[2:27:00.280 --> 2:27:05.880]  yeah there it is video appears to show trump embracing a 2016 campaign staffer she's now suing
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:12.360]  and claims he forcibly kissed her but the video shows the complete opposite and her leaning into
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:18.680]  kiss him him kissing her on the cheek and uh you know he's he's the bad guy total lies what do you
[2:27:18.680 --> 2:27:25.000]  make of this um i mean i think people are going to watch that and they're going to see whatever
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:28.600]  they want to see right because i mean there's really been if we look at what's happened with
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:34.920]  trump no no evidence substantial evidence to support any of this uh these people they have
[2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:39.960]  trump derangement syndrome for lack of a better term and i mean they'll make whatever they want
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:44.440]  of it i think we're at a point now where we saw this with russia gate as well they're willing to
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:50.200]  anything they could possibly grasp that in order to make him look guilty like a predator uh corrupt
[2:27:50.200 --> 2:27:55.640]  whatever it may be they're going to take thankfully i think it's at a point for most people where
[2:27:55.640 --> 2:28:01.320]  they've just gotten tired of all the lies and all the no i agree in fact this is we mentioned it anymore
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:06.600]  here's the elva johnson 15 second clip of what she's suing him for she comes over they kiss on the
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:18.440]  side of the cheek she said he squeezed her kissed her on the lips she's suing her it is
[2:28:26.920 --> 2:28:31.160]  and that's the exchange uh when we come back i'm going to tell some listeners
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:35.400]  some of the things i've dealt with with with people i've known including people that are
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:40.600]  their periphery family when the new york times calls them up officer money on the daily mail
[2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:43.880]  and then they tell them what they want they tell them the lies they want to hear and then
[2:28:43.880 --> 2:28:49.960]  the check is cut what our guest said is true there's no bottom you're dealing with criminal syndicates

[2:33:13.800 --> 2:33:21.400]  when a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac he was dressed he was dressed like 1950
[2:33:21.400 --> 2:33:30.440]  half drunk and hollow eyed he said it's a long walk to Nashville would you like to ride waging war on

[2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:51.720]  then i noticed a stranger was ghost white tear when he asked me for a light
[2:33:52.680 --> 2:33:56.600]  and i knew there was something strange about this ride
[2:33:58.120 --> 2:34:02.440]  he said drippler can you might as well cry when you're all right i tend to go to all your phone
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:10.040]  calls mac anabelle john christ richard travis Jerome and more across the board here we're
[2:34:10.040 --> 2:34:17.320]  in the middle of this 34-hour special live global transmission 1776 worldwide i like how
[2:34:17.320 --> 2:34:24.280]  tommy robinson over a year ago on the show said i am not a victim i'm a target and i'm doing this
[2:34:24.280 --> 2:34:29.160]  willingly but i i don't want to get killed so if i can get the truth out and fight this evil and
[2:34:29.160 --> 2:34:35.560]  not get killed that's fine but if i'm gonna get killed so be it and there's something so refreshing
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:40.040]  and human and manly about that that i was talking and she's going to be joining us tomorrow with
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:45.480]  much exclusive footage uh to one of the reporters that works for info wars teddy hopkins who was out
[2:34:45.480 --> 2:34:51.800]  there that that he just it felt like victory as he was going into that prison for literally
[2:34:51.800 --> 2:34:57.400]  exposing giant child kidnapping rings some of the children this is in mainstream news were killed
[2:34:57.400 --> 2:35:06.360]  cut up and used and sold in kabob machines so and then the court says well you're in contempt
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:11.560]  you're not supposed to report on that and people go well he wasn't contempt it violates magna
[2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:17.800]  carta it violates law to spend years in jail tardi spent time now he's gonna spend more time
[2:35:18.360 --> 2:35:22.200]  for reporting on what's happening you know what he's satisfied at the end of the day but talking
[2:35:22.200 --> 2:35:27.400]  to our guest lauren chin who works for blaze tv dot com four slash lauren you can find our work
[2:35:27.400 --> 2:35:33.960]  right there follow her on twitter at the lauren chin this is going to radicalize conservatives
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:37.560]  nationalist christians i don't know what you call yourself i've seen your show quite a bit but i just
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:44.680]  think of myself as more of a populist uh you know libertarian little l uh you know type guy and
[2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:50.600]  but i do kind of sit back every day looking at this news and i'm like i shouldn't even get more
[2:35:50.600 --> 2:35:58.600]  upset this is real tyranny this is classical evil and then i see what i mentioned earlier and i don't
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:03.240]  want to get into the long stories but the new york times will wash and post before but especially
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:08.360]  new york times they will stalk me for years they will call everybody i ever knew anybody
[2:36:08.360 --> 2:36:13.000]  ever worked here they will offer a money they will then threaten them they'll then guilt them about
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:18.440]  how bad you've been they'll go i'm sorry and then they'll have people literally make stuff up for
[2:36:18.440 --> 2:36:22.280]  money i was talking to the daily mail and i said how much did you pay them we're not going to tell you
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:29.560]  so i used a law enforcement tactic i said what 20 grand well no it was 10 000 to say i wear swastika
[2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:36.520]  shoes uh or that i fire guns at people's feet in the office totally insane like you know kind of a
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:43.800]  simpson's version of a texan uh or just just all of this insanity that goes on and then you asked
[2:36:43.800 --> 2:36:50.600]  yourselves how did this many of our countrymen and women become so evil so soulless so corrupt and
[2:36:50.600 --> 2:36:56.600]  even if trump stays in office we kind of fix things what do we do with the wreckage of a third of the
[2:36:56.600 --> 2:37:01.720]  population or so if you go to a leftist event you've seen this they look like they are neither living
[2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:08.600]  dead they are uh they're promoting pedophilia it just it's what is i'm kind of ranting i apologize
[2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:12.920]  but you get the gestalt of what i'm saying what do you make of this culture because i just
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:15.560]  if there was some country to move to to get away from these people i'd do it
[2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:21.800]  no it's absolutely terrifying and i'm someone like you i talk about these issues a lot and i
[2:37:21.800 --> 2:37:26.760]  feel like there's not an accurate way there are no words i could use to make people understand
[2:37:26.760 --> 2:37:32.280]  how serious this is i mean with tommy robinson i mean just for people who are watching who are in
[2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:38.040]  the us or canada you know there there was a i think uh the press were barred from reporting on the
[2:37:38.040 --> 2:37:43.000]  event um you know that's something to do in the uk even that concept is kind of foreign especially i
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:47.160]  think to americans right there's nothing like that for ongoing trials in the states as far as i'm
[2:37:47.160 --> 2:37:52.440]  aware of um and then if you kind of look at the fact that he the the charges were dropped for him
[2:37:52.440 --> 2:37:57.240]  and then they were retaken up and then he was convicted that kind of sounds like violating
[2:37:57.240 --> 2:38:01.720]  double jeopardy to me i don't know about you but just the whole thing with tommy robinson there's
[2:38:01.720 --> 2:38:07.000]  nothing about it that shouldn't scare the british people and you know the the brit the british
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:11.160]  government that the system they use it's not like like the u.s there's no enshrine second
[2:38:11.160 --> 2:38:16.680]  amendment or first amendment rather and the you know the slippery slope that they've gone through
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:20.760]  it just goes to show how when it comes to something like freedom of speech you really can't take
[2:38:20.760 --> 2:38:25.240]  anything for granted right you can't just assume that everything's going to be guaranteed and
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:29.320]  protected because it's simply not going to be and i think we've seen the past few years how
[2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:34.760]  quickly those rights can erode unless they are specifically protected uh for anyone who's watching
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:39.400]  who's the supporter of tommy robinson i think now is like the time there's never going to be a more
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:43.480]  important time for you to voice your dissent to your government that you're not okay with this
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:49.880]  happening and i mean it's it's not just the uk unfortunately if we look at even canada um you
[2:38:49.880 --> 2:38:55.080]  know this kind of thing is happening people are starting to want to make hate speech prosecutable
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:59.560]  by the federal government the u.s thankfully hasn't gotten that bad yet but i think it's only a matter
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:03.720]  of time when the people who advocate for these these types of measures pick up more steam and
[2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:08.280]  you know you're right it feels like there's nowhere else you can go right now but that's safe and i
[2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:13.160]  saw i think it was on your show specifically tommy's now asking for political asylum i mean people
[2:39:13.160 --> 2:39:17.880]  have laughed at him for doing so but i think he's absolutely justified it this is exactly political
[2:39:17.880 --> 2:39:22.920]  prosecution for his political beliefs and i think it's discussing that this is happening in a you
[2:39:22.920 --> 2:39:30.040]  know so-called western democracy like the uk take asia bb our own david night made this point the
[2:39:30.040 --> 2:39:34.680]  other morning this is a wonderful woman no criminal record a mother facing a death sentence
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:42.600]  because it's a christian it's blasphemy if she drinks out of a well being a christian now the
[2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:49.720]  uk she asked for asylum in the uk and uh the current prime minister prisa may said no you'll
[2:39:49.720 --> 2:39:56.360]  upset the muslims and so she asked trump for it this is a woman this is a christian this is exact
[2:39:56.360 --> 2:40:01.000]  but i noticed we won't let christians out of syria we only let an amount against muslims
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:06.520]  except they get worship they get protected they get covered up and then this woman
[2:40:06.520 --> 2:40:11.800]  who's a christian is is treated like a dog worse than a dog she can't drink out of a because it
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:16.440]  gives pakistan they have public water supply she's not supposed to get water like black people can't
[2:40:16.440 --> 2:40:22.280]  go to the water fountain or whatever it's beyond that and trump wouldn't take her in why because
[2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:26.440]  nobody got the message to him i got the message to him on her pyro he did that i got the message to
[2:40:26.440 --> 2:40:31.160]  him on the submarine her he talked to him i brought it up to him he did that but i can't get
[2:40:31.160 --> 2:40:35.240]  tommy robinson to him because of the people around trump controlling him it's disgusting
[2:40:36.920 --> 2:40:41.320]  no you're absolutely right and i'm someone who i i'm very critical of the whole refugee and asylum
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:46.040]  system that's in place right now very very critical of a lot of the claims that are being made about
[2:40:46.040 --> 2:40:50.520]  who's deserving of it and who's not and just in general the way the un system has set things up
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:55.640]  but when it comes to someone like asia bb i think if if we are going to take in refugees and if i
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:41:01.240]  think if we do so it'll be out of generosity not because of out of you know any supposed obligation
[2:41:01.240 --> 2:41:06.040]  but if we are going to i think to me it makes sense to take the people who are being targeted
[2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:11.880]  for their you know minority beliefs people like you know christians like asia bb or someone even
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:16.920]  like tommy robinson and look i i don't mean to come compare their two situations i understand
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:21.000]  they're very differently a lot of people may say what's the big deal he's just being sent to prison
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:25.640]  it's not like it's a death sentence understand that in the prisons like these uk prisons they're
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:30.280]  overrun with islamists right and this is not a conspiracy theory it's a noted problem they're
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:36.520]  run by muslim gangs right exactly and um last time tommy was in prison he spent a lot of time
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:42.120]  in solitary confinement for his own safety it was said and he was also he spoke about how
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:46.680]  he had a little window facing the courtyard these people would shove their feces into his room
[2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:52.440]  i mean it's not it's not an exaggeration to say that his life is in danger if he goes to one of
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:56.040]  these prisons i mean it's all the way he was being polite on there i got the full story from him
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:00.920]  they would hang their asses in they'd stick the genitals in and the guards just let him do this
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:05.960]  and exactly political asylum is when it's known the cuban government is is is putting somebody
[2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:10.120]  into prison or it's known you're going to prison for your speech or it's known that there's a death
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:14.200]  sentence out because you're a christian woman and hiding because you dare drink out of a well
[2:42:14.200 --> 2:42:20.200]  that's when you know you get asylum bring them not oh 150 000 people showed up this week they all
[2:42:20.200 --> 2:42:25.240]  claim asylum let them in right and i think that the left they're trying to conflate the issue
[2:42:25.240 --> 2:42:30.120]  they're trying to make refugee or asylum seekers synonymous with economic migrant from a poorer
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:33.880]  country right they're two very very different terms there should be different laws applying
[2:42:33.880 --> 2:42:39.320]  to them they're not the same thing and as someone who is the daughter of an immigrant from hong kong
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:43.240]  like the the idea that all anyone who's foreign is just the same they're all living under the
[2:42:43.240 --> 2:42:47.880]  same condition conditions therefore all the same was like no that's not how immigration works it's
[2:42:47.880 --> 2:42:51.480]  exactly lauren shins stay there blaze tv hosts amazing lady we'll be back
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:43:04.760]  1776 worldwide that's a term i coined 15 years ago what does it really mean it means the idea of
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:11.000]  american freedom renaissance worldwide doesn't mean we go conquer countries it means our superior
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:18.200]  western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism it's night and day we're
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:25.640]  going to do a 34-hour special broadcast that kicks off this thursday morning at 8 a.m. with david night
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:31.480]  runs right through with me and many others till the next day at 6 p.m. on the war room we're
[2:43:31.480 --> 2:43:37.000]  going to have our crew in dc at the white house summit on social media we're going to be at the
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:42.440]  after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more so everybody
[2:43:42.440 --> 2:43:49.720]  share that link info wars dot com forward slash show kicking off this thursday at 8 a.m. central
[2:43:49.720 --> 2:43:57.240]  at info wars dot com forward slash show 1776 worldwide robert barnes what does big tech become
[2:43:57.240 --> 2:44:00.840]  a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they
[2:44:00.840 --> 2:44:05.480]  face no consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two
[2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:10.040]  decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent
[2:44:10.040 --> 2:44:13.400]  free press that care about this the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care
[2:44:13.400 --> 2:44:18.040]  about this have to bring real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct
[2:44:18.040 --> 2:44:21.960]  otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:26.520]  the big trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the
[2:44:26.520 --> 2:44:30.840]  ground until we were able to recover after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel
[2:44:30.840 --> 2:44:36.120]  that flames the the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent
[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:40.920]  free speech to make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big
[2:44:40.920 --> 2:44:45.560]  tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:49.560]  to shake people's thoughts and then the war of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:54.040]  the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:45:01.400]  just saw the globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators they are technocrats they
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:05.720]  are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life make
[2:45:05.720 --> 2:45:11.480]  your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with ai gods now we're fighting
[2:45:11.480 --> 2:45:15.720]  them hard in cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension but one of the
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:20.440]  biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[2:45:20.440 --> 2:45:25.640]  is our bodies if i wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for the forest life calm i

[2:47:24.440 --> 2:47:28.120]  trump the republicans of the democrats as we know it's mainly the democrats involved but
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:33.320]  those that they're setting it up for that tommy robinson convicted of journalism the uk is now
[2:47:33.320 --> 2:47:38.040]  north three in his words and there's a new article tommy robinson's final plea to trump
[2:47:38.040 --> 2:47:43.240]  my family needs asylum antifa and islamists have already been to his house they pledged to kill
[2:47:43.240 --> 2:47:49.080]  them the police said they won't protect them i wonder why the left has to like cheerfully the
[2:47:49.080 --> 2:47:53.880]  destruction of the west as hundreds of supporters gathered around london's old bailey courthouse
[2:47:53.880 --> 2:47:57.800]  awaiting the sentencing of tommy robinson the british patriot made one last plea for help to
[2:47:57.800 --> 2:48:04.520]  president trump uk online newspaper caught tommy on his way to the courthouse on thursday asked
[2:48:04.520 --> 2:48:09.880]  what is your message to trump our freedoms are gone don't stand by and watch this is another country
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:15.000]  other than britain everyone would be intervening robinson replied do you think he'll grant you
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:20.520]  asylum uh public occurrence is asked which tommy responded my family needs asylum we genuinely
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:26.200]  need asylum this has been a political persecution of witch hunt by people who want to kill me but
[2:48:26.200 --> 2:48:30.600]  it's orchestrated by my own government and you've got city cons saying trump needs to be tried for
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:35.800]  war crimes or kick him out of the uk or don't want him come and then we just always ignore it and bow
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:41.480]  down and just let them have the moral high ground what's your comment on this lauren chen and then
[2:48:41.480 --> 2:48:48.040]  a blaze tv and then is there a way out of this for reconciliation with the with the college and the
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:55.320]  and the corporate brainwashing sensitivity training leftist cults where these people just get
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:59.960]  crazier and crazier in the end i think they're gonna lose but it's so sad that so many people are
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:05.560]  just wrecking their futures yeah well i think city cons just spent a little bit more time worrying
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:10.280]  about his city's own stabbing problem uh spend a little less time trash talking trump that might be
[2:49:10.280 --> 2:49:15.560]  good for london i mean but but overall um i think tommy absolutely is right to fear for the safety
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:22.120]  of his family um whether trump is gonna give him specifically asylum i unfortunately don't really
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:26.440]  see that happening i think there's a lot of diplomatic issues there especially that he's
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:31.240]  already been convicted right so if the us were to take him that just brings up extradition questions
[2:49:31.240 --> 2:49:35.800]  unfortunately i don't think it's gonna happen i really wish it would but i i guess we'll see in
[2:49:35.800 --> 2:49:40.760]  terms of his family though i absolutely think they should be able to leave um their people who
[2:49:40.760 --> 2:49:45.400]  their addresses have been docs he spoke about it and he's spoken about in interviews they've had to
[2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:49.640]  move several times because of all the death threats and these aren't just you know random trolls on
[2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:53.880]  the internet there are people out there that would absolutely be willing to hurt him i think we've
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:50:01.480]  seen that enough i i would love to say that we've reached a point where the the rational centrist
[2:50:01.480 --> 2:50:07.320]  or you just anyone who isn't a far-left progressive has gotten tired of all the craziness the political
[2:50:07.320 --> 2:50:13.000]  division um you know letting these lunatics run our governments you know i would love to say that
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:17.640]  it's over that it's gonna stop but frankly and i've talked about this a lot on my show the way
[2:50:18.200 --> 2:50:23.480]  the far left has have set things up right they control media they control establishment news
[2:50:23.480 --> 2:50:29.480]  they control pop culture tv shows they control education elementary schools up to colleges they
[2:50:30.120 --> 2:50:34.120]  they really have a good hold on the system right now and i think i'm not saying that
[2:50:34.920 --> 2:50:38.520]  you know that it's worth stopping fighting or anything like that but i think it's gonna take
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:43.720]  a lot more from anyone who's upset about these issues i think what you're saying is we better
[2:50:43.720 --> 2:50:47.800]  decide whether we're gonna give up or really fight hard because they're done exactly they're trying
[2:50:47.800 --> 2:50:53.960]  to submit their takeover exactly and i mean i think what we are maybe starting to see cracks right
[2:50:53.960 --> 2:50:58.200]  and i think independent media is a huge part of this again i'll i'll praise independent media for
[2:50:58.200 --> 2:51:02.520]  kind of breaking the cycle of control that the establishment has had for so long there are a
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:06.440]  lot of stories like everything that tom he's trying to bring awareness to with the whole grooming
[2:51:06.440 --> 2:51:11.240]  gangs without people like him these people would just be completely unaware of what's happening
[2:51:11.240 --> 2:51:15.320]  in their own country and you always know when somebody's over the target they're being persecuted
[2:51:15.320 --> 2:51:23.000]  no absolutely and i think it's the whole thing with tommy it should scare people in the uk not
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:27.160]  not just because you support him or not but it should scare you that your government treats
[2:51:27.160 --> 2:51:32.040]  these ideas with such disdain right because anything tommy speaks up against like they're
[2:51:32.040 --> 2:51:36.600]  not really prosecuting just him they're trying to make an example of him to anyone who's gonna
[2:51:36.600 --> 2:51:40.920]  say the type of things that he does you know to raise awareness to the issues that he does like
[2:51:40.920 --> 2:51:46.680]  the grooming gang and mass migration exactly um so if you're if you're someone who just casually
[2:51:46.680 --> 2:51:52.360]  supports him or agrees with him whether or not you're his biggest fan like this is an attack on
[2:51:52.360 --> 2:51:58.200]  you specifically directly in closing people can find your show obviously at blaze tv dot com
[2:51:58.200 --> 2:52:04.920]  four slash lauren you see polosi acting like she's dissing herself from aoc but that's really the
[2:52:04.920 --> 2:52:12.280]  globalist policies aoc just doesn't have pissed away and lies when she gets caught uh and so
[2:52:12.280 --> 2:52:16.760]  they're trying to act like oh you know the party split and i was watching different democrats on
[2:52:16.760 --> 2:52:21.160]  foxes this morning saying we all need to come together and be more centrist know the truth is
[2:52:21.160 --> 2:52:25.160]  republicans have tried to be centrist we get drug along with their leftist garbage and the left now
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:31.240]  has just run away like a fish or the line and the most extreme insanity and so the media's
[2:52:31.240 --> 2:52:36.040]  spending it like we all need to be less extreme conservatives and christians and people we're
[2:52:36.040 --> 2:52:42.280]  not extreme we're promoting stuff that works that's tried and true like family and property and the
[2:52:42.280 --> 2:52:47.560]  right to defense and borders and and and just and then their meanwhile saying there's hundreds of
[2:52:47.560 --> 2:52:53.560]  genders and pedophilia is good and world government's good and open borders are good america sucks
[2:52:53.560 --> 2:52:58.040]  and then we're like okay what's the alternative it's just these people i don't know how they got so
[2:52:58.040 --> 2:53:04.120]  whacked out well i think i've brought this up to have a leftist going insane and i've had people
[2:53:04.120 --> 2:53:09.400]  say well everybody's a little bit more polarized and etc etc they've actually done studies they
[2:53:09.400 --> 2:53:14.760]  track the trends of political opinions in the us and they they they can prove with data that over
[2:53:14.760 --> 2:53:20.200]  the past few decades the right wing conservatives republican party they've remained pretty consistent
[2:53:20.200 --> 2:53:24.280]  right someone who identifies as right wing now is going to have a lot of common ground with
[2:53:24.280 --> 2:53:30.680]  someone who identified right wing let's say 20 30 years ago the same is not the case is not the same
[2:53:30.680 --> 2:53:35.880]  for the left wing they actually have demonstrably gone further left than they ever have been i mean
[2:53:35.880 --> 2:53:40.360]  we see this with even people like nancy polosi chucks schumer um you know there are tapes or
[2:53:40.360 --> 2:53:45.560]  barack obama of them you know maybe 10 years ago talking about the the importance of securing the
[2:53:45.560 --> 2:53:50.120]  border they're not they're not saying that kind of stuff anymore one of the only positive things
[2:53:50.120 --> 2:53:55.320]  i can say about aoc is i think she is so far left that even nancy polosi and people like that are
[2:53:55.320 --> 2:54:02.680]  starting to say okay maybe we need to slow things down a little bit um that's honestly the only hope
[2:54:02.680 --> 2:54:07.320]  i think the democrats have right now because i think among a very small base of people these
[2:54:07.320 --> 2:54:12.040]  far left progressives people like aoc are great they're amazing but i think the democratic party
[2:54:12.040 --> 2:54:16.760]  needs to realize that america in general is not woke twitter they need to stop pandering to these
[2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:21.800]  people or else they're going to feel it in elections that's right and uh lauren chin thank you so much
[2:54:21.800 --> 2:54:25.960]  for coming on i i i love your show and i got a chance i watch it i see the clips all over the
[2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:30.600]  internet people should follow the blaze tv but when you pull back from all the stuff that's
[2:54:30.600 --> 2:54:35.800]  happening the gatekeepers the left try to always keep the right wing from talking to each other
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:40.840]  they always lie on everybody else to make sure we're all atomized we're all vulcanized and the
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:45.560]  fact that you and others like steven krauter and others from blaze tv uh you know buck that trend
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:50.520]  of control that is so essential to not letting the left dictate to who we talk to when we talk to
[2:54:50.520 --> 2:54:55.480]  them so thanks for coming on and have a great week coming up for sure and again thank you so much

[2:57:47.320 --> 2:57:51.720]  holding hey i'll yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot
[2:57:51.720 --> 2:57:55.880]  of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody
[2:57:55.880 --> 2:58:00.200]  agrees with these wars i think that the new york cons are trying desperately to get trump to go
[2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:04.760]  to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the
[2:58:04.760 --> 2:58:09.320]  public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his
[2:58:09.320 --> 2:58:12.760]  presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's
[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:16.600]  a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i
[2:58:16.600 --> 2:58:20.920]  know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love

[3:00:11.480 --> 3:00:17.320]  an excited crowd running down broadway they toppled the statue of king george
[3:00:17.320 --> 3:00:23.640]  and melted it into bullets for battle the far away king would soon learn a timeless lesson
[3:00:23.640 --> 3:00:32.440]  about the people of this majestic land americans love our freedom and no one will ever take it away
[3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:39.800]  from us this was a exorcism against the new world order and against the america hating
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:46.280]  uh systems that wanted to moralize us this was a very christian very americana pure western
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:54.920]  renaissance uh moment this was absolutely amazing i am so honored by it all uh that we've come this
[3:00:54.920 --> 3:00:59.320]  far together and i'm i know a lot of you are very very happy right now this is a big deal on this
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:09.240]  july four we pay special tribute to the military service members who laid down their lives for
[3:01:09.240 --> 3:01:15.720]  our nation we are deeply moved to be in the presence this evening of gold star families
[3:01:15.720 --> 3:01:23.960]  whose loved ones made the supreme sacrifice thank you thank you what he invoked what power he called
[3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:33.160]  down versus the globalist and the corporate media spinning and rolling and and spitting and
[3:01:33.160 --> 3:01:39.880]  hissing in total abject hatred and the public completely turning against them when they did it
[3:01:39.880 --> 3:01:45.000]  it is a rosetta stone president trump's tweeting about it this morning saying it will be the show
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:50.920]  of a lifetime but will it be this show of unity and patriotism or a show of partisan politics as a
[3:01:50.920 --> 3:01:56.200]  lot of democratic critics are calling it with one describing this as a vanity project and to make it
[3:01:56.200 --> 3:02:06.600]  into what seems to be kind of a combination trump rally and kim jong-un style military parade of
[3:02:06.600 --> 3:02:13.240]  hardware and equipment presidents don't speak at the fourth of july and they they it's the people's
[3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:19.720]  day it's not the president's day and uh and he's trying to turn it into something else and man i
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:28.520]  just think it's it's i think it's awful a window into the good and the bad what an incredible time
[3:02:29.240 --> 3:02:35.320]  to be alive ladies and gentlemen what an amazing time that same american spirit that emboldened
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:41.080]  our founders has kept us strong throughout our history to this day that spirit runs through
[3:02:41.080 --> 3:02:48.760]  the veins of every american patriot it lives on and each and every one of you here today
[3:02:48.760 --> 3:02:56.440]  it is the spirit daring and defiance excellence and adventure courage and confidence loyalty and
[3:02:56.440 --> 3:03:03.240]  love that built this country into the most exceptional nation in the history of the world
[3:03:03.240 --> 3:03:11.160]  and our nation is stronger today than it ever was before it is its strongest now
[3:03:11.160 --> 3:03:19.560]  wow trump almost broke down crying three times and you could see him gulping back never seen
[3:03:19.560 --> 3:03:32.520]  his body language malania was on fire like some angelic queen and what was radiating americana
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:39.720]  and the love of the country and they know exactly what they're doing and they understand that this
[3:03:39.720 --> 3:03:45.640]  is literally a ritual of bringing christianity back into america and love of our nation and
[3:03:45.640 --> 3:03:51.720]  love of our people and unity the exact opposite of what the globalists are saying and what the
[3:03:51.720 --> 3:04:00.440]  globalists are doing and all of the different christian songs that they played and invoking god
[3:04:00.440 --> 3:04:07.400]  and invoking christ and to see that huge diverse crowd of people out there wanting to come together
[3:04:07.400 --> 3:04:12.920]  wanting to love the good parts of america and knowing that trump's pulling troops out of all
[3:04:12.920 --> 3:04:18.600]  these countries and trying to stop all these big wars has been nominated for a peace prize which he
[3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:25.320]  actually deserves that's why we then celebrate our military and all of it because the globalists
[3:04:25.320 --> 3:04:41.240]  are trying to divide us demoralize us culturally poison us
[3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:59.080]  i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna
[3:04:59.080 --> 3:05:02.920]  kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the
[3:05:02.920 --> 3:05:06.680]  censorship of the tax and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the
[3:05:06.680 --> 3:05:10.280]  products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts
[3:05:10.280 --> 3:05:14.040]  to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:17.400]  support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because
[3:05:17.400 --> 3:05:21.160]  they know how great they are and how wonderful they work and the left always has headlines everywhere
[3:05:21.160 --> 3:05:27.960]  jones sells unapproved supplements and he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996
[3:05:27.960 --> 3:05:32.600]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the fda because they have no jurisdiction and
[3:05:32.600 --> 3:05:37.080]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[3:05:37.080 --> 3:05:40.920]  is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things
[3:05:40.920 --> 3:05:44.840]  and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:05:50.680]  doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two
[3:05:50.680 --> 3:06:06.760]  five three three one three nine crashing through the lies and disinformation it's
[3:06:06.760 --> 3:06:18.120]  alex jones
[3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:23.480]  better on the tension speaking you to text him
[3:06:35.640 --> 3:06:38.600]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome into hour number four
[3:06:39.560 --> 3:06:44.360]  we're going to continue live until six p.m. tomorrow night i really appreciate everybody

[3:06:49.400 --> 3:06:53.240]  shows and i promise you'll go to the head of the line really appreciate you holding i meant to get
[3:06:53.240 --> 3:06:59.560]  to you we just ran out of time leah strahanahan has worked for liberal newspapers conservative
[3:06:59.560 --> 3:07:06.040]  newspapers he has a syndicated radio host out of dc i've been on a show many times he's been on with
[3:07:06.040 --> 3:07:14.600]  us many times and he's a pretty smart guy and i found a lot of his research is is is original
[3:07:14.600 --> 3:07:19.800]  and very accurate uh that doesn't mean that his interpretation of my interpretation might be different
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:26.440]  sometimes and i'm also not somebody that tends when i've worked with somebody kind of a weakness
[3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:31.320]  i have that i'll then don't turn a blind eye but i have to see a lot of evidence before i get really
[3:07:31.320 --> 3:07:37.480]  angry at him um that said once i started listening to some of the things that lee was saying it
[3:07:37.480 --> 3:07:42.200]  reminded me of a bunch of things that quite frankly i'd forgotten because i do so much
[3:07:42.200 --> 3:07:47.560]  research look at so much news i know so much about the epstein case the last decade that gives me a
[3:07:47.560 --> 3:07:52.600]  headache and then a lot of the stuff he brought up i'd forgotten and i went and looked it up and it
[3:07:52.600 --> 3:07:59.960]  was true now clearly epstein was working for some branch of intelligence foreign intelligence we're
[3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:05.800]  not sure muller he was working with muller muller had him as an informant he was protecting him
[3:08:06.440 --> 3:08:10.920]  uh bill clinton was the one on the airplane with a bunch of democrats some republicans
[3:08:10.920 --> 3:08:15.400]  i've not seen any evidence of trump i'm not just defending trump all this epstein crap was out
[3:08:15.960 --> 3:08:21.720]  before i even endorsed trump i went and looked it up so i'm not in some exercise to protect trump
[3:08:23.400 --> 3:08:27.080]  but what i want to know from lee stranahan and i'm gonna have other guys talk about this with
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:34.440]  different views we're going to try to suss this out is who is the media going to try to target
[3:08:34.440 --> 3:08:42.200]  with all this why did he get busted last week why did he get raided when he had been given
[3:08:43.480 --> 3:08:48.920]  a pass by the state prosecutors the local prosecutors and then given a mild sentence
[3:08:48.920 --> 3:08:57.960]  by the u.s attorneys at that time under george w bush and then obama why had all that gone on i'm
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:09:05.000]  not defending uh the guy that was you know the fed that gave the clause i passed who's now the head
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:09.240]  of labor i'm just saying i don't see him as the villain and all this i see the people
[3:09:09.240 --> 3:09:13.720]  trafficking the kids on the planes those that were involved but the media tends to be focusing
[3:09:13.720 --> 3:09:20.280]  off on trump and his his his cabinet appointment so so i obviously that's partisanship this is
[3:09:20.280 --> 3:09:23.400]  the same media that tells you nobody was there at the fall of the july rally it's the same
[3:09:23.400 --> 3:09:27.240]  media that says trump raped all these women it turns out it's not true same media says that
[3:09:27.800 --> 3:09:33.560]  just outrage yourself about me but what i want to understand is who are the different cogs in
[3:09:33.560 --> 3:09:41.720]  this machine because i like uh lee stranahan i like mike sternovich who's been on the show
[3:09:41.720 --> 3:09:46.440]  many times broken a lot of big news you know defended me when they've made up lies about me
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:53.800]  but i knew that it was der schwitz i saw him on fox news months ago four or five months ago saying
[3:09:54.920 --> 3:10:03.240]  i have sued one of epstein's reported victims because and lee's the fact what guy he has it all
[3:10:03.240 --> 3:10:07.320]  in a list in front of him i'm going from memory here so crap if i'm wrong anytime we just jump in
[3:10:07.320 --> 3:10:15.240]  i'm about to go to you i have sued this woman to release documents to show i'm not in them i'm like
[3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:22.120]  great uh the the sternovich and others join that suit it comes out and then right away when that
[3:10:22.120 --> 3:10:27.240]  information comes out three or four days later epstein gets crap or two or three days later well
[3:10:27.240 --> 3:10:33.960]  the media took that as if well this lawsuit uh is what triggered epstein being grabbed the street
[3:10:33.960 --> 3:10:37.880]  even though it was already great pressure it's not about saying who gets credit for who doesn't
[3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:44.040]  get credit for it it's about understanding why we've heard the media that it was what alan
[3:10:44.040 --> 3:10:49.400]  der schwitz did that caused the raid alan der schwitz has been the lawyer by the way we should add
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:54.200]  of jeffrey epstein that's why this gives me a headache there's so many angles and you know the
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:58.840]  new thing we're in culturs basically say this is really suspicious alan der schwitz is saying well
[3:10:58.840 --> 3:11:04.120]  i was at his house his seven-story pleasure compound in new york and an old german woman gave me a
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:12.520]  massage not a young girl and you know i uh had my underwear on uh oh well okay uh all i'm saying is
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:18.840]  what really happened with epstein who do you really work for and then what's all this
[3:11:19.480 --> 3:11:24.920]  corollary stuff with alan der schwitz and the media saying that's what triggered this new bust
[3:11:24.920 --> 3:11:30.600]  and then you've got you've got comey's daughter as the prosecutor i mean it gives like like i said
[3:11:32.360 --> 3:11:37.880]  i'm not accusing anybody of anything uh i know the clinton's are heavily into sex trafficking
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:43.480]  i know they're into corruption i know that's a secret sauce they use as a underworld currency
[3:11:43.480 --> 3:11:49.880]  we've trailblazed that the specifics though of who's who and what's going on i'm not sure of it i
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:55.480]  don't want to misstep or miss you know accuse anybody here uh so stranding we're going to
[3:11:55.480 --> 3:11:59.720]  break in four minutes i try in this segment the next is as quickly as you can to kind of talk
[3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:05.640]  about what we do know and why the rollout of all this you think is fishy well yeah so let me talk
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:10.440]  about this for a second alex and i gotta say you're definitely ahead of me in this stuff because
[3:12:10.440 --> 3:12:15.880]  this is one of those stories and you know how it's like you you can only focus on so much right
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:20.440]  this is one of those stories that to me at first was like the stormy daniel's story
[3:12:20.440 --> 3:12:27.560]  in that it's a todry story but it didn't seem that you know like it's bad for the clinton's but
[3:12:28.360 --> 3:12:33.800]  i didn't know i didn't really know much about it didn't focus on it then when i started to look into
[3:12:33.800 --> 3:12:39.000]  it after this recent arrest and everything people were coming to me they're going well the media
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  is cutting out cernovich and i'm i don't think anybody i think if you if you do work on a story
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:50.200]  you should get credit for it period and and so i'm not giving sort of it's tons of credit
[3:12:50.200 --> 3:12:55.160]  i'm not here mad because he's got a bunch of credit more power to it i'm not i'm not either but when
[3:12:55.160 --> 3:13:00.680]  i looked into it here here's what i found so let's talk about the facts that we know for sure first
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:08.440]  off as you just put up akasta the labor secretary and this is why i agree with you i think akasta
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:14.200]  is the patsy right now let me explain i'm not trying to justify it or anything but to me he's
[3:13:14.200 --> 3:13:20.200]  the patsy and here's why it was reported by no less than the daily beast not exactly an
[3:13:20.200 --> 3:13:27.800]  a pro trump source that akasta was told as you as you reported also on info wars akasta was told
[3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:35.000]  leave epstein alone he's intelligence that's what we've been reported right now if that's the case
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:42.440]  that epstein is intelligence let's ask ourselves a question who else uses do intelligence agencies
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:49.480]  want to blackmail people of course they do do we know for a fact that epstein had cameras
[3:13:49.480 --> 3:13:55.480]  and was videotaping people in this pleasure palace in these massage rooms yes we know
[3:13:55.480 --> 3:14:02.600]  that too that is a matter of public record right so when you get the intelligence agencies involved
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:08.600]  alex there's going to be a lot of disinformation and misinformation and it's not going to be
[3:14:08.600 --> 3:14:14.760]  directed at one side it'll be directed very you know you know how the cia works right my
[3:14:14.760 --> 3:14:20.200]  that they're experts at this you know how the deep state works you know how british intelligence
[3:14:20.200 --> 3:14:28.200]  works this is an information campaign so what i looked into was i looked into okay cernovich
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:33.320]  is saying he did this let me look into that dirshowitz is saying this let me look into that
[3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:41.000]  and base here's what we know for sure first off jeffrey epstein got a sweetheart deal that you
[3:14:41.000 --> 3:14:51.480]  mentioned and that deal was sealed now did alan dirshowitz or mike cernovich get that deal unsealed
[3:14:51.480 --> 3:14:57.480]  no they did not they don't even claim to what they did was they got involved in the civil suit
[3:14:57.480 --> 3:15:03.720]  between one of epstein's victims and this woman gazelle maxwell now by the way let me just do a
[3:15:03.720 --> 3:15:10.280]  quick parenthetical her father was robert maxwell and alex i think you know who robert maxwell is
[3:15:10.280 --> 3:15:19.000]  he is a so all the stories say an mi6 agent and a mosad agent who was a big media mogul in great
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:27.880]  britain that's the father of the girlfriend that epstein was using to procure women with his his
[3:15:27.880 --> 3:15:33.400]  girlfriend 20 years ago when a lot of this stuff was going on that's her father robert maxwell
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:38.360]  who died under mysterious circumstances in 1991 so we got spooks crawling out of the walls here
[3:15:38.360 --> 3:15:44.120]  let's come back and talk about this and and what this really means and who epstein was really working
[3:15:44.120 --> 3:15:50.200]  with and how they're gonna try to frame trump uh and uh costa and others on the other side and then
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:56.680]  how dirshowitz ties in finally there's a way for you to get into the blockchain the hottest financial

[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:01.960]  to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york
[3:18:01.960 --> 3:18:06.680]  city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[3:18:06.680 --> 3:18:11.720]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[3:18:11.720 --> 3:18:16.440]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[3:18:16.440 --> 3:18:19.960]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be
[3:18:19.960 --> 3:18:23.960]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the

[3:20:49.400 --> 3:20:55.560]  normal we got a little mark zuckerberg even though it's a twitter they've still got mark zuckerberg
[3:20:55.560 --> 3:21:02.120]  as their as their little uh i guess you call it mascot right there big sarcastic that all
[3:21:02.120 --> 3:21:09.560]  sees a robot or an alien but uh getting serious turned out that mark zuckerberg has had bots and
[3:21:09.560 --> 3:21:13.560]  hundreds of employees tracking people for years that claim he's an alien i never really thought it
[3:21:13.560 --> 3:21:17.160]  until now we'll talk about that some towards you in the broadcast but here's what's serious
[3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:25.320]  twitter down site not working for users around the world started about 45 minutes ago and some
[3:21:25.320 --> 3:21:30.360]  are saying twitter's showing trump who's boss because that's how he communicates is on twitter
[3:21:30.360 --> 3:21:35.480]  and trump there's been radio silence so far for a press conference or an event or maybe the whole
[3:21:35.480 --> 3:21:42.760]  nsa big telecoms that uh you know obama put internet kill switch in maybe maybe they're showing
[3:21:42.760 --> 3:21:48.360]  twitter who's boss a very interesting coincidence not a lot of stuff's coincidental but a long
[3:21:48.360 --> 3:21:54.200]  time since twitter was completely down worldwide trump has said that jack dorsi's a liar he said
[3:21:54.200 --> 3:21:59.320]  that jack dorsi's engaged in criminal activity he promised to take action against them uh and
[3:21:59.320 --> 3:22:06.120]  then now twitter is down worldwide uh what do you make of that well i i think one of the things
[3:22:06.120 --> 3:22:11.320]  i should point out alex is about the same time that the twitter outage happened this social media
[3:22:11.320 --> 3:22:17.400]  summit started at the white house uh just a mile or so away from where i am uh and at the white
[3:22:17.400 --> 3:22:22.680]  house they're having this big social media summit of course twitter is a major part of the social
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:27.640]  media infrastructure in this country so i find it very interesting i think i think we could find
[3:22:27.640 --> 3:22:34.520]  for instance that it's possible that hackers took down twitter to call attention to the social
[3:22:34.520 --> 3:22:41.320]  media summit or something but i i find that outage very very interesting as well so let's talk but
[3:22:41.320 --> 3:22:45.400]  let's make sure let's go back to can we go back to the epstein stuff for a second yes let's go
[3:22:45.400 --> 3:22:50.040]  right back to that yeah because there's a ton of stuff here and it does that's why you're on i just
[3:22:50.040 --> 3:22:54.120]  have tried to cover up the epstein stuff i'm diverting with twitter down that's why i personally
[3:22:54.120 --> 3:23:00.680]  took twitter down no lian i'm not i'm not accusing you of that i'm joking it's pretty insane though
[3:23:00.680 --> 3:23:05.400]  what do you think's happening with twitter that we'll get back to epstein yeah so yeah i think i
[3:23:05.400 --> 3:23:08.600]  think the well what do i think of twitter right see the problem is i've been using twitter for a
[3:23:08.600 --> 3:23:14.920]  long time and the danger is that i like it i think it's an important part of it as let me just say
[3:23:14.920 --> 3:23:21.000]  this as a journalist alex you know this most people who are in the audience don't experience this
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:26.520]  you have to be on twitter if you're a journalist because right now it used to be 15 years ago
[3:23:26.520 --> 3:23:32.600]  people would do press releases if they announced a death or a divorce now they do a tweet right so
[3:23:32.600 --> 3:23:38.440]  literally the way to get news first you have to go to twitter i consider instagram or facebook you
[3:23:38.440 --> 3:23:43.480]  know you can be on it or not if you're a journalist you have to be on twitter and i'll tell you what
[3:23:43.480 --> 3:23:51.960]  they do that really bugs me alex i i on one hand i don't like any form of censorship so if let's
[3:23:51.960 --> 3:23:56.360]  say roger stone our mutual acquaintance roger stone i'm friend love you know roger i'm friends with
[3:23:56.360 --> 3:24:02.680]  roger and uh i don't like the fact that they took his account but what i don't like more is that they
[3:24:02.680 --> 3:24:08.360]  erased the account that existed in other words if they'd said hey roger we don't like what you're
[3:24:08.360 --> 3:24:13.080]  doing or the alex we don't like what you're doing or whoever so we're not no instead it's like burning
[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:17.880]  all the books that author ever wrote if he gets in trouble for something now we destroy his whole
[3:24:17.880 --> 3:24:23.560]  record so he can now lie about his record that's that's exactly right so i want to be able to see
[3:24:24.440 --> 3:24:30.920]  what you said or what roger said or whoever anybody i want to be able to see what they said
[3:24:30.920 --> 3:24:37.320]  and then i can decide for myself they've made it much more difficult you can't use the twitter search
[3:24:37.320 --> 3:24:44.120]  engine to find and and they did it to roger before a federal indictment came down against him
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:50.760]  that hinges on don't forget muller and other media have lied about what he said that time in the barrel
[3:24:50.760 --> 3:24:56.280]  line right they they misquote it they put you know exactly i want to get back to absentee because
[3:24:56.280 --> 3:25:00.280]  you're right this is the big firestorm the left sacking like they think it's going to bring down
[3:25:00.280 --> 3:25:05.800]  trump uh you've got comey's daughter in there uh i mean are they crazy enough when they're all the
[3:25:05.800 --> 3:25:10.760]  known pedophiles to try this on trump and then what do you make of the media giving credit
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:16.360]  to dershowitz for when he brings out this stuff on a civil suit not bringing out the stuff that
[3:25:16.360 --> 3:25:22.600]  was in the criminal file what why are you concerned about that well here's here's my big concern i and
[3:25:22.600 --> 3:25:30.040]  i make no i don't know whether alan dershowitz is guilty but i absolutely know this he's been accused
[3:25:30.040 --> 3:25:38.680]  by multiple people separately of knowing about the epstein situation or participating in it
[3:25:38.680 --> 3:25:44.600]  molt more than one victim has said dershowitz knew and dershowitz was there now i don't make any
[3:25:44.600 --> 3:25:49.960]  claim as to whether they're telling the truth or they're false and he's not been charged he
[3:25:49.960 --> 3:25:56.520]  absolutely is innocent and too pro proving guilty but i do know that he's on a major pr campaign
[3:25:56.520 --> 3:26:03.080]  and that he was trying to get that material in this civil suit not the criminal suit released
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:08.920]  because a he's an epstein a because he's been accused and b he's an epstein attorney and an
[3:26:08.920 --> 3:26:17.560]  epstein friend now i also know that an attorney named mark randaza is the guy who and this is on
[3:26:17.560 --> 3:26:24.520]  the record mark randaza he has a blog called legal satiricon he is pro dershowitz and has written
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:29.560]  a blog post that said i don't think i think these are absurd charges he did that a couple of years
[3:26:29.560 --> 3:26:34.040]  ago sure let me just throw in mark randaza has represented me on like peppy the frog he's a big
[3:26:34.040 --> 3:26:40.120]  first amendment lawyer that's right you know you know mark but and i'm i'm not knocking i've i i
[3:26:40.120 --> 3:26:45.080]  know mark he is a first amendment lawyer he saw all kinds of clients including mike syrnovich
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:51.240]  and syrnovich said the other night that the way he got involved in the epstein case was that his
[3:26:51.240 --> 3:26:59.160]  lawyer and by the way marks is the lawyer of record mike did not file file himself randaza
[3:26:59.160 --> 3:27:05.240]  filed and again he's a lawyer i guess he could have but randaz is the one who contacted mike
[3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:10.440]  and said do you want to get involved in this so it's not something like came up with on his own
[3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:16.920]  now that's all again that's all fine and if someone wants to take the position that they think
[3:27:16.920 --> 3:27:23.720]  that alan dirshowitz is innocent they should i'm in favor of that they should feel free to do that
[3:27:23.720 --> 3:27:31.480]  what i don't like is this sort of uh misinformation where a lot of people think and mike has said it
[3:27:31.480 --> 3:27:39.560]  that because he filed which again randaza did and mike has said a lawyer contacted him
[3:27:39.560 --> 3:27:44.440]  that's why it happened that's why this whole criminal case happened i don't think so and i
[3:27:44.440 --> 3:27:51.080]  think it's a distraction from let's go back to the big story let's think about this alex if jeff
[3:27:51.080 --> 3:27:59.720]  fstein is intelligence as the daily beast is reported acosta was told this becomes a story
[3:27:59.720 --> 3:28:05.800]  i want you to think about this how many americans alex whether they're democrats or republicans
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:14.680]  left or right want the u.s government supporting and protecting child molesters in the name of
[3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:20.840]  national security that is insane no i think 90 percent are against it i mean i mean a good third
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:25.080]  of democrats support it that's their religion but yeah 90 percent of the public would be against
[3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:30.280]  the democrat religion well no that that's exactly right and they and because they don't know about
[3:28:30.280 --> 3:28:36.920]  it so if this acosta thing that came out in the daily beast and again that's a mainstream but
[3:28:36.920 --> 3:28:42.840]  tie this together for me because when we come back why why it's a big deal that cernovich did this
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:47.240]  suit i'm not saying you're wrong but like who do you think's really behind it what's really going on
[3:28:47.240 --> 3:28:54.360]  why is this cernovich thing a big deal that he sued to get documents released when you have a
[3:28:54.360 --> 3:29:01.080]  pain in the neck a real pain in the neck back shoulder or legs you now have two convenient

[3:30:43.720 --> 3:30:48.360]  this is providence so i salute you and i thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart
[3:30:49.160 --> 3:30:59.560]  info wars the most banned network in the world 1776 worldwide that's a term i coined
[3:30:59.560 --> 3:31:06.680]  15 years ago what does it really mean it means the idea of american freedom renaissance worldwide
[3:31:06.680 --> 3:31:12.840]  doesn't mean we go conquer countries it means our superior western values of true freedom
[3:31:12.840 --> 3:31:19.880]  get adopted because compared to globalism it's night and day we're going to do a 34 hour special
[3:31:19.880 --> 3:31:26.360]  broadcast that kicks off this thursday morning at 8 a.m with david night runs right through with me
[3:31:26.360 --> 3:31:33.080]  and many others till the next day at 6 p.m on the war room we're going to have our crew in dc at the
[3:31:33.080 --> 3:31:38.360]  white house summit on social media we're going to be at the after party with all the key folks
[3:31:38.360 --> 3:31:43.560]  taking action against censorship and so much more so everybody share that link info wars.com
[3:31:43.560 --> 3:31:51.160]  forward slash show kicking off this thursday at 8 a.m central at info wars.com forward slash
[3:31:51.160 --> 3:31:58.200]  show 1776 worldwide it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public
[3:31:58.200 --> 3:32:03.240]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[3:32:03.240 --> 3:32:08.040]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[3:32:08.040 --> 3:32:12.040]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all
[3:32:12.040 --> 3:32:17.640]  that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of
[3:32:17.640 --> 3:32:21.800]  press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[3:32:21.800 --> 3:32:26.520]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[3:32:26.520 --> 3:32:30.120]  this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[3:32:30.120 --> 3:32:34.280]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[3:32:34.280 --> 3:32:39.560]  control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and
[3:32:39.560 --> 3:32:44.680]  the info wars audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the
[3:32:44.680 --> 3:32:48.920]  modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[3:32:48.920 --> 3:33:07.160]  onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:08.200 --> 3:33:15.960]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:23.880]  war now least ran a hand got interrupted by my twitter outage and and so that got us off the
[3:33:23.880 --> 3:33:28.200]  rails there but twitter is completely down right now all trumps big social media summits unfolding
[3:33:29.160 --> 3:33:32.200]  we're gonna be tracking this throughout the evening we've got eight different crew members
[3:33:32.200 --> 3:33:35.640]  three different reporters or four different reporters on the ground in dc so much coming
[3:33:35.640 --> 3:33:40.760]  up the war room here in about 25 minutes least ran hands a syndicated radio host out of dc
[3:33:40.760 --> 3:33:47.320]  lee talked to me like i'm five years old because i saw the 11 minute piece on uh periscope and it
[3:33:47.320 --> 3:33:51.480]  made sense it was interesting so i wanted to get where you were going but tell us kind of your
[3:33:51.480 --> 3:33:56.440]  summation up front your opening statement and then where you're going because okay ellen der
[3:33:56.440 --> 3:34:00.760]  schwitz was the lawyer and then colter sure thinks it's weird we'll play a clip of her in a moment
[3:34:01.320 --> 3:34:05.080]  fur app steam it said hey i wasn't the young girls i was with an old lady but i was wearing my
[3:34:05.080 --> 3:34:09.640]  underwear she gave me massage okay i get it you know they have people have masseuses come and give
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:14.440]  massages i'm not saying he's guilty of pedophilia because he was a lawyer for ebbstein but then
[3:34:14.440 --> 3:34:20.680]  you're saying hey the media everybody's giving cernovich credit because they won their suit to
[3:34:20.680 --> 3:34:25.320]  release stuff on one of the victims they thought to prove that uh derch what's hadn't done anything
[3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:29.880]  fine i've been accused a lot of fake stuff too i say more power to them but then how does that
[3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:34.840]  tie into the media and and and what really came out and why the feds really went after ebbstein
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:40.600]  last friday so to quantify what you think's really going on here because i'm not smart enough
[3:34:40.600 --> 3:34:45.400]  with all the looking at each angle and this and that to know what you're getting at okay so here's
[3:34:45.400 --> 3:34:51.400]  what it is ellen der schwitz a hundred percent there's no doubt he is currently doing a pr campaign
[3:34:51.400 --> 3:34:56.600]  to say that this victim is lying about him right there's no question about that now how's he doing
[3:34:56.600 --> 3:35:03.640]  it he was on the view two days ago now he's also using cernovich and he's got multiple people
[3:35:03.640 --> 3:35:08.600]  his friends at joel pollack over at bright part news who used to be a research assistant for him
[3:35:08.600 --> 3:35:15.320]  here's what here's what ellen der schwitz is doing he is doing a pr campaign to say this victim of
[3:35:15.320 --> 3:35:22.440]  ebbsteins is lying about me ellen der schwitz whether that's true or not he's doing that pr campaign
[3:35:22.440 --> 3:35:29.720]  and he's doing it directing it at people on the right why why people on the right because ultimately
[3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:36.840]  and look at der schwitz since the election he realizes that it's smart to get trump on his side
[3:35:36.840 --> 3:35:41.880]  therefore if he gets trump supporters on his side and again not saying he's innocent or guilty
[3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:46.920]  saying that's factually true he wants to get people who are trump supporters on his side why
[3:35:46.920 --> 3:35:52.600]  because trump's president he also wants to get women on his side to have a shadow of a doubt
[3:35:52.600 --> 3:35:58.680]  maybe ellen der schwitz didn't do it you know the people should be skeptical but what he's doing
[3:35:58.680 --> 3:36:04.760]  he's a ebbstein lawyer who has come out and said we don't know what i don't he said i don't know what
[3:36:04.760 --> 3:36:10.840]  jeff ebbstein's done and so therefore that's his position okay that's fine what i'm suggesting is
[3:36:10.840 --> 3:36:18.920]  part of what he's doing is doing a pr campaign to misdirect people and here's the danger let's
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:25.000]  talk about the danger of this whole thing first off as we talked about at the top of the segment
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:31.080]  if ebbstein is connected to intelligence alex this is the biggest buried story in the country
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:37.000]  right now because it means a child molester convicted child molester was being backed by
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:42.600]  intelligence agencies included but here's like let's just stop everything alexa i mean forgive
[3:36:42.600 --> 3:36:52.360]  me a costa said that he was uh that he was told by somebody back off now if that's true that he was
[3:36:52.360 --> 3:36:58.200]  told that here's the obvious next question who told you that really you were told to back off
[3:36:58.200 --> 3:37:04.360]  on jeff ebbstein who told you i haven't seen anybody in the media asking that question of a costa
[3:37:04.360 --> 3:37:12.040]  who told you that because because alex think about this let's say he was told that by robert
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:19.240]  mueller that's gigantic news right let's say he was told that by name anybody we want to know who
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:22.920]  it is yeah we want to know well listen if you started the interview out i have young is your
[3:37:22.920 --> 3:37:27.880]  smart guy on here all the pieces with hey he's obviously works for intelligence agents uh you
[3:37:27.880 --> 3:37:33.720]  know maybe the israelis you know the fbi of the us clearly that's going on we want to know exactly
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:40.760]  who he's been protected obviously i agree with you that uh so far alexander a costa is the scapegoat
[3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:45.000]  he was ordered to do this the guy got some gel time i think that's a distraction they're trying
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:50.280]  to blame trump they found some evidence fine you know walk the plank trump but we don't see that yet
[3:37:50.280 --> 3:37:57.320]  i was wondering if you were focusing so much uh on uh alan dirshowitz and and then uh on uh you
[3:37:57.320 --> 3:38:01.720]  know a journalist you got approached by a lawyer hey let's find out what's really in these files
[3:38:01.720 --> 3:38:06.280]  i mean i mean i see that as being pretty reasonable uh unless you've got some other angle that's
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:10.920]  there i'm just wondering why the why the front loading about alan dirshowitz i must say it's
[3:38:10.920 --> 3:38:17.400]  bad to do that alan dirshowitz uh and of course mike sernovich well here's the thing uh let's
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:23.000]  talk about where where alan dirshowitz fits in the political universe one thing that i've noticed
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:28.840]  here is that alan dirshowitz and again i'm not somebody who's overly critical of uh of israel
[3:38:28.840 --> 3:38:37.320]  but i see the the role that the zionist lobby has in this country at apac and stuff like that and
[3:38:37.320 --> 3:38:42.280]  i've covered and again i've you know worked with breitbart and stuff like that so i'm aware of how
[3:38:42.280 --> 3:38:49.960]  that goes but alan dirshowitz has a purpose in that he is always brought out as an advocate
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:58.120]  for the for the state of israel he's brought out there now if in fact alex it turns out
[3:38:58.120 --> 3:39:05.720]  that epsi was a massad agent as multiple reports are suggesting then is it possible again there's a
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:13.080]  disinformation campaign here that dirshowitz is part of some general disinformation campaign
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:18.280]  to make a costa the patsy i'm using that term because of course oswald used that and that's
[3:39:18.280 --> 3:39:23.880]  kind of how i see a costa right now he's the guy who everybody's focused on but here's the question
[3:39:23.880 --> 3:39:30.520]  who told a costa that this guy was intelligence and let's find out who that is and say intelligence
[3:39:30.520 --> 3:39:36.520]  for who no i agree a costa needs to say who told him to back off yes and then he refused to back
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:41.880]  off and got the bare minimum he could because i saw that press conference are like how dare you
[3:39:41.880 --> 3:39:46.440]  tell the justice department and your agency signed over control three years ago and you took over to
[3:39:46.440 --> 3:39:51.880]  make sure every family is vetted that it's actually their kids and and that criminal charges be on
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:56.760]  smugglers and a costa goes how is that bad i haven't i'm not just here defending trump because he
[3:39:56.760 --> 3:40:03.000]  appointed a costa i just it's obvious they're trying to crucify this guy it is and like i say
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:07.720]  when i see the information that's come out i just go and again you know it's as soon as you talk
[3:40:07.720 --> 3:40:11.880]  about zionism or stuff like that people get freaked out about it but again i'm not somebody who's
[3:40:11.880 --> 3:40:16.760]  anti-semitic i'm not somebody like i say he's got a bill no i'm not anti-israel myself but israel
[3:40:16.760 --> 3:40:21.880]  has a bunch of spy agencies they've been caught a bunch doing it in the u.s and epstein has all
[3:40:21.880 --> 3:40:27.320]  the trappings of being multiple intelligence agencies he cut out we know he was working for moller
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:33.640]  and if you look at his connection such as this guy west lexer for instance he's he's a less
[3:40:33.640 --> 3:40:41.400]  lexer he's the guy from uh victoria's secret the limited he's a big billionaire he was the guy
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:48.200]  who seems to be jeffrey epstein's only client read lexer epstein's not really a billionaire he
[3:40:48.200 --> 3:40:54.360]  looks like a classic color right right exactly right and so what i'm suggesting is if alan
[3:40:54.360 --> 3:41:01.320]  dirshowitz who is a advocate for the state of israel like on the almost officially you know he
[3:41:01.320 --> 3:41:09.480]  he's brought out in cnn if he's covering for a mosad agent that's significant right in the same way
[3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:15.240]  that if he was connected to the cia and covering for cia sure but but i mean give me the mosad
[3:41:15.240 --> 3:41:19.720]  connections because there there might be some there's some there but it's admitted that epstein
[3:41:19.720 --> 3:41:24.360]  was an informant to the fbi and robert moller so why are we going with i'm not defending israel
[3:41:24.360 --> 3:41:29.000]  they did it fine uh israel certainly runs sex operatives that's well known but but what about
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:34.200]  the fbi it's a growth the fbi is a huge factor in here and of course they work together look
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:39.080]  we see this in the trump russia collusion alex who shows up all the time british intelligence
[3:41:39.080 --> 3:41:45.560]  right uh a certain amount of israeli intelligence and people connected to ukraine the israeli
[3:41:45.560 --> 3:41:49.240]  intelligence is connected to this anti-putin drive because don't forget they weren't sure
[3:41:49.240 --> 3:41:53.000]  they're they're using the state department money in ukraine they're using that as the muddy and
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:57.080]  fence what intelligence agency's doing it i think it's the state department here's the
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:02.680]  mosad here's the mosad connection remember the girlfriend right there you're showing it that's
[3:42:02.680 --> 3:42:09.320]  guess that arrow is pointing to giselle maxwell that's that's that seems pimp and and and she
[3:42:09.320 --> 3:42:14.280]  right exactly right and she is at the front row of chelsea clinton's wedding front row
[3:42:14.280 --> 3:42:21.000]  giselle maxwell's father is robert maxwell there's an a book out on amazon called don't
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:28.360]  understand her dad was a famous israeli spy chief british spy guy right maxwell is alleged to be
[3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:37.480]  right mosad and mi6 he died under mysterious circumstances in 1991 okay lee lee this is all
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:42.280]  interesting it's good food for thought but who is who are they going to blame for epstein
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:46.840]  how are they going to cover up it's mainly democrats what about that time bomb i really
[3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:51.320]  want to focus on that okay and again i appreciate you coming on
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:43:02.520]  so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting
[3:43:02.520 --> 3:43:07.400]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:12.840]  one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach
[3:43:12.840 --> 3:43:17.560]  it is the one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining
[3:43:17.560 --> 3:43:22.520]  self-structured little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content
[3:43:22.520 --> 3:43:26.520]  goes up the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and
[3:43:26.520 --> 3:43:30.280]  supporting info wars and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether
[3:43:30.280 --> 3:43:34.120]  it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want
[3:43:34.120 --> 3:43:38.680]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same
[3:43:38.680 --> 3:43:43.960]  time support press support speech support letting the audience choose what news they want to see
[3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:48.040]  and what views they want to hold and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and
[3:43:48.040 --> 3:43:53.640]  experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets as we
[3:43:53.640 --> 3:44:00.520]  witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history the globalists are backed
[3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:07.080]  into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war borders are being broken and sovereignty
[3:44:07.080 --> 3:44:14.840]  is being challenged the world is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those
[3:44:14.840 --> 3:44:21.640]  who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails the system is vulnerable electricity could
[3:44:21.640 --> 3:44:28.680]  be gone in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days having storable foods
[3:44:28.680 --> 3:44:35.080]  and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level and being without
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:41.560]  puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system buys storable foods
[3:44:41.560 --> 3:44:48.840]  and an alexa pure gravity water filter today support mankind by being prepared and support
[3:44:48.840 --> 3:44:57.160]  freedom by buying from info wars store dot com the second american revolution is happening

[3:49:24.120 --> 3:49:28.440]  and what we do because it scares the hell out of them live coverage of president trump social media
[3:49:28.440 --> 3:49:33.480]  summit from washington news wars dot com enforces a team of eight reporters on the ground dc
[3:49:33.480 --> 3:49:39.320]  as part of our special 34 hour broadcast let's say a crew of eight uh and again news wars dot
[3:49:39.320 --> 3:49:45.640]  com doesn't get blocked by the filters as much so share that live feed off of that page and i am
[3:49:45.640 --> 3:49:50.520]  excited because trump says he's going to take action the big tech's about to get it he always has
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:54.600]  meetings with them first hopes they'll back off now they haven't backed off now he's having
[3:49:54.600 --> 3:49:59.960]  meetings with the people that have been victimized uh and and and so now i i look for action uh
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:04.840]  close to the left has gone completely insane uh they are engaged in all sorts of criminal activity
[3:50:04.840 --> 3:50:10.920]  that's one hell of a time to be alive least ran a hand just 35 000 foot view on this because the
[3:50:10.920 --> 3:50:17.080]  investigative journalist has been studying all the different factoids involved clearly i think
[3:50:17.080 --> 3:50:23.080]  what you're getting at is alan dershowitz was his lawyer alan dershowitz admits will play the
[3:50:23.080 --> 3:50:30.600]  clip in a moment that he was in his underwear with a old quote german woman massaging fine and and
[3:50:30.600 --> 3:50:34.520]  then you've got another journalist over here whose lawyer his friends with dershowitz contacts him
[3:50:35.240 --> 3:50:40.120]  and says hey we ought to do this suit against one of the victims because dershowitz says it's bull
[3:50:40.120 --> 3:50:43.400]  we need a third party to get this out and then they get the third party stuff and it doesn't
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:48.120]  show dershowitz in it and but let me i've been falsely accused of stuff too so you start seeing
[3:50:48.120 --> 3:50:53.320]  everything as a nail when you're a hammer but also wasn't fc's lawyer but you know people deserve
[3:50:53.320 --> 3:50:58.280]  lawyers so so i'm not accusing anybody here but i get your point why is everything in the news
[3:50:58.280 --> 3:51:04.840]  about alan dershowitz and about oh my god he exposed fc now fc's been arrested thanks to cernovich
[3:51:04.840 --> 3:51:09.720]  when as you pointed out the fbi rated him because it's all over the news and the cover-up we've been
[3:51:09.720 --> 3:51:14.920]  hammering it so so i just think you're irritated because what's in the media about why this happened
[3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:23.000]  isn't a fact a is that true and then b why didn't did the fbi rate them last week well so i
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:28.760]  it irritated so i get i get mad first off i'm not trying to take credit for anything as i said
[3:51:29.560 --> 3:51:36.040]  i i didn't wasn't looking at this story then when i started to look at it some stuff was so obvious
[3:51:36.040 --> 3:51:40.360]  to me like for instance whatever again i'm not saying alan dershowitz is guilty of anything
[3:51:40.360 --> 3:51:47.080]  but he's clearly still an advocate for epstein right so right or wrong he's an advocate for
[3:51:47.080 --> 3:51:52.440]  epstein and is out there in public saying stuff well we don't really know that this happened
[3:51:52.440 --> 3:51:58.520]  or that happened second you've had lawyers how many of your lawyers if you said hey uh if you
[3:51:58.520 --> 3:52:04.600]  want a massage i'm just saying that's so dershowitz is more than a lawyer right he's a guy who's
[3:52:04.600 --> 3:52:11.400]  who's getting a massage at epstein's house yeah i'm not teddy massages with my lawyers
[3:52:11.960 --> 3:52:16.040]  that's that's right it's an odd thing to do and let me point out the other thing alex especially
[3:52:16.040 --> 3:52:21.480]  since you're doing this 1776 event which is so important let me talk about why info wars is
[3:52:21.480 --> 3:52:27.320]  really important yet this is one of the there's plenty of sites out there that have news you
[3:52:27.320 --> 3:52:34.440]  are one of the few sites alex with your especially from a pro liberty viewpoint some sites on the
[3:52:34.440 --> 3:52:39.080]  left are pretty good about this 23 you know consortium news or whatever about covering the
[3:52:39.080 --> 3:52:44.360]  history of the cia you're one of the few sites that's a pro liberty site who's talked about
[3:52:44.360 --> 3:52:49.720]  project mockingbird who's talked about north woods who's talked about all these historical
[3:52:49.720 --> 3:52:55.560]  examples going back decades now why do i bring this up what you know alex and what i know
[3:52:56.120 --> 3:53:01.640]  because we know the history of these intelligence agencies as soon as you find out the cia is
[3:53:01.640 --> 3:53:07.640]  involved you need to be very careful because they want to control the information space
[3:53:07.640 --> 3:53:12.840]  sure that what you're saying is why is the media making it dirshowitz on the radar as the as a good
[3:53:12.840 --> 3:53:18.680]  guy and then we've got over here a costa as the bad guy clearly the media whether dirshowitz is
[3:53:18.680 --> 3:53:23.720]  involved or not is trying to make it about trump that's that's right and they're also trying to
[3:53:23.720 --> 3:53:32.680]  make it about like if the if the result here is epstein gets another sweetheart deal basically
[3:53:32.680 --> 3:53:37.800]  people need to really watch this case because if it's intelligence you're not going to get the
[3:53:37.800 --> 3:53:43.960]  truth and by the way nobody should take anything is one of those trust no one obviously when you
[3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:48.600]  say intelligence it's mafias in the government interfacing with intelligence agencies clearly
[3:53:48.600 --> 3:53:52.840]  it was a giant blackmail scheme that's how the clinton's operate we know this it's how the deep
[3:53:52.840 --> 3:53:56.840]  state's been operating it's how the bushes have been operating so i don't think there's any doubt
[3:53:56.840 --> 3:54:04.360]  that epstein was was kind of a master procure or familiar to organize all of this the question is
[3:54:04.360 --> 3:54:08.760]  who are the big players on the deep state i think we already know so so i was getting irritated
[3:54:08.760 --> 3:54:12.840]  earlier to saying why is allen dirshowitz the focus or any of this but but but i get what you're
[3:54:12.840 --> 3:54:17.800]  saying is they're using that as the distraction because clearly that's not why they rated epstein
[3:54:17.800 --> 3:54:21.880]  because they got this lawsuit info they already had all other info most that was already in the
[3:54:21.880 --> 3:54:25.960]  public show let's give an example of who they're not talking about have you heard anybody talking
[3:54:25.960 --> 3:54:31.400]  about bill richardson the former governor of new mexico on the board of genie energy who's
[3:54:31.400 --> 3:54:38.280]  in epstein's black book there's not a question in the world he's on the flight logs bill richardson
[3:54:38.280 --> 3:54:44.920]  is a major political player he is at apco apco worldwide is a big lobbying company the guy who's
[3:54:44.920 --> 3:54:49.720]  also at apco jonathan weiner he's the guy who brought christopher steel into this these are all
[3:54:49.720 --> 3:54:57.240]  the players alex that went on the trump russia collusion uh conspiracy theory those lies about
[3:54:57.240 --> 3:55:02.120]  that those people connect including max well by the way you've heard me talk about this guy bill
[3:55:02.120 --> 3:55:10.920]  broder his max well his sale max well was epstein's girlfriend procurer robert max well was bill
[3:55:10.920 --> 3:55:17.080]  broder's mentor all of these people you mentioned comey you mentioned muhler it's not an accident
[3:55:17.080 --> 3:55:22.440]  well no exactly the classic deep state is to use underage people to set everybody up that is the
[3:55:22.440 --> 3:55:27.400]  standard deal for corrupt western intelligence agencies and it's amazing places like china
[3:55:27.400 --> 3:55:31.320]  that you threaten to kill your family all right well it was good talking to you at least ran a

[3:58:44.120 --> 3:58:48.040]  talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding hey i'll yeah i just want
[3:58:48.040 --> 3:58:52.120]  to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york
[3:58:52.120 --> 3:58:56.840]  city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[3:58:56.840 --> 3:59:01.880]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[3:59:01.880 --> 3:59:06.600]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[3:59:06.600 --> 3:59:10.200]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be
[3:59:10.200 --> 3:59:14.360]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last
[3:59:14.360 --> 3:59:18.440]  thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements
[3:59:18.440 --> 3:59:23.000]  have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i'd love to see what
[3:59:23.000 --> 3:59:27.960]  you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you
[3:59:27.960 --> 3:59:32.600]  won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are
[3:59:32.600 --> 3:59:36.840]  going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the input war and even if something does happen
