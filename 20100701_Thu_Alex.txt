[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:36.280]  it is Thursday the first day of the new month July 1st we're gonna be live here
[00:36.280 --> 00:42.200]  for the next four hours we will simulcast the second third and fourth
[00:42.200 --> 00:49.280]  hour in living video color at prisonplanet.tv for prisonplanet.tv
[00:49.280 --> 00:57.920]  viewers but this is first and foremost a radio broadcast we only have one guest
[00:57.920 --> 01:03.520]  joining us today and then his congressman Ron Paul sometime in the last hour
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.520]  he is on the house floor today they are expecting votes so he could it end up
[01:08.520 --> 01:13.000]  even being on conceivably earlier and occasionally he has to come on the next
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.600]  day so it could be tomorrow we've interviewed him literally it's it's
[01:17.600 --> 01:22.280]  got to be close to a hundred times the last 15 years and when he is on the
[01:22.280 --> 01:27.120]  floor about 10% of the time he ends up coming on the next day but congressman
[01:27.120 --> 01:32.360]  Ron Paul scheduled as they say across the pond with incredibly important
[01:32.360 --> 01:39.880]  intel on the scuttlebutton congress on a strike on Iran that is clearly in the
[01:39.880 --> 01:46.280]  making they've set the table they're bringing out the roast suckling pig and
[01:46.280 --> 01:50.720]  the question is will they start thrusting their daggers into the flesh
[01:50.720 --> 01:54.960]  we'll also get his take on the economy that he's predicted of course decades
[01:54.960 --> 01:59.080]  ago what is now happening what these bankers always do in every nation they
[01:59.080 --> 02:03.800]  control the fractional reserve banking really it's quite simple money laundering
[02:03.800 --> 02:08.560]  slash counterfeiting but it's not counterfeit because they run the
[02:08.560 --> 02:12.200]  government criminally so they get away with it leave you holding the bag after
[02:12.200 --> 02:16.280]  the Ponzi scheme implodes and so we'll talk to a congressman Ron Paul about
[02:16.280 --> 02:19.640]  that as well and a lot of other central issues like the federal elections
[02:19.640 --> 02:24.520]  commission starting an investigation this is very serious of campaign for
[02:24.520 --> 02:29.240]  liberty and openly saying that they're not allowed the key here is to tell
[02:29.240 --> 02:35.560]  American voters how congressmen voted and the house has passed an even more
[02:35.560 --> 02:39.640]  draconian bill where there can be no free speech six months out from an
[02:39.640 --> 02:44.040]  election of any political organization just you can't tell voting records you
[02:44.040 --> 02:48.800]  can't even give your opinion no free speech in America and they're going
[02:48.800 --> 02:57.280]  after the internet I mean it's it's so brazen so naked that it is hard to deal
[02:57.280 --> 03:04.400]  with hard to even be able to to face up to even when you understand how corrupt
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.920]  and oppressive this system is it is naked this is not a conspiracy theory
[03:09.920 --> 03:17.360]  this is a criminal conspiracy takeover fact now every day I start the broadcast
[03:17.360 --> 03:23.240]  and here we are July 1st 2010 and things are only intensifying and I say that the
[03:23.240 --> 03:27.080]  the straights are becoming more dire by the minute that the quickening is
[03:27.080 --> 03:32.320]  accelerating that everything's coming to a head the good is coming to the for the
[03:32.320 --> 03:36.700]  bad is coming to the for the evil is coming to the surface the absurd is
[03:36.700 --> 03:40.400]  coming to the surface the corrupt is coming to the surface the honor is
[03:40.400 --> 03:45.200]  coming to the surface the patriotism is coming to the surface the love of god
[03:45.200 --> 03:48.680]  and the truth is coming to the surface the love of evil is coming to the
[03:48.680 --> 03:54.740]  surface the battle is on between good and evil and it's only gonna get more
[03:54.740 --> 03:58.780]  insane from here I have a giant stack of financial news we're gonna cover that
[03:58.780 --> 04:04.460]  that first. I don't have to tell you the stock market is in free fall. The media is now admitting
[04:04.460 --> 04:08.860]  we're in depression. This is all being done by design. We've been in depression for years.
[04:08.860 --> 04:16.380]  All the real economic numbers of savings versus debt, public, private, corporate, international,
[04:18.940 --> 04:25.500]  of the types of jobs people have, the deindustrialization, the unemployment numbers,
[04:25.500 --> 04:32.380]  the inflation numbers, were sunk. When you talk about $600 trillion as the Washington Post admits
[04:32.380 --> 04:37.980]  last week, quite amazing they had meant that. It's more like $1.5 trillion, $1,500 trillion.
[04:38.700 --> 04:44.620]  This is like shooting someone 8 million times with a.45 caliber handgun. They are going to die.
[04:45.980 --> 04:52.220]  I mean, it's the overkill is so ridiculous. We're dead. We're a wasteland unless we arrest
[04:52.220 --> 04:57.580]  the Goldman Sachs bankers and reverse all this. Okay? There's no debating. Either they go or we go.
[04:57.580 --> 05:04.220]  You understand? Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a
[05:04.220 --> 05:09.660]  battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[05:09.660 --> 05:15.660]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[05:15.660 --> 05:20.940]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[05:20.940 --> 05:25.580]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[05:25.580 --> 05:30.220]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[05:30.220 --> 05:35.580]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[05:35.580 --> 05:40.780]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[05:40.780 --> 05:45.820]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to

[06:58.940 --> 07:03.500]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[07:03.500 --> 07:08.620]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[07:08.620 --> 07:13.580]  our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[07:13.580 --> 07:19.180]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[07:19.180 --> 07:23.580]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[07:23.580 --> 07:28.860]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[07:28.860 --> 07:33.500]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families lose their power from
[07:33.500 --> 07:38.860]  weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[07:38.860 --> 07:43.260]  peace of mind. Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[07:43.260 --> 07:49.180]  one of my old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[08:01.180 --> 08:06.860]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[08:10.220 --> 08:14.300]  Coming up I've had time the last few days really analyze this reported
[08:15.100 --> 08:18.620]  suite of an 11 member Russian sleeper cell
[08:18.620 --> 08:26.060]  and the Wall Street Journal and others have headlines like spying as networking
[08:27.100 --> 08:33.660]  and they say if these are spies it's a new type of spy. They didn't try to infiltrate government
[08:33.660 --> 08:40.780]  officials. They tried to infiltrate major corporations. Well I mean that's what British
[08:40.780 --> 08:46.300]  intelligence did a hundred years ago on record. They've written many books about it. They brag
[08:46.300 --> 08:54.780]  about it. The British came in and took over New York City socialite society. They came in and
[08:54.780 --> 09:01.100]  they infiltrated banking. They came in and set up the council on foreign relations because in
[09:01.100 --> 09:05.900]  America the robber barons ran the country. The corporations had already had a coup d'état
[09:05.900 --> 09:10.380]  and so if you're a foreign intelligence operation if you can come in and take control of the
[09:10.380 --> 09:14.940]  corporations you control the country. That's all the council on foreign relations and the
[09:14.940 --> 09:25.660]  trilateral commission is. Globalism is treason. Globalism is a corporate takeover. Globalism is
[09:25.660 --> 09:38.620]  espionage. Espionage. It is economic sabotage. They come in, they shut your country down,
[09:38.620 --> 09:42.300]  they only allow businesses to operate through government that they own and control.
[09:42.300 --> 09:47.180]  They put tax incentives on moving to China where they've got deals with corrupt Chinese
[09:47.180 --> 09:52.300]  officials who will only let them operate. Then no one can compete with slave goods.
[09:52.300 --> 09:57.100]  It consolidates the power of the elite, bankrupts the United States and then makes
[09:57.100 --> 10:04.220]  us feudal serfs. I mean this is the British mercantile slave model they used to control
[10:04.220 --> 10:09.980]  the Caribbean for 400 years that they used to control Asia for hundreds of years that they
[10:09.980 --> 10:17.260]  used to take over China. When they put Mao in they just set up the neocolonial mercantile model
[10:17.260 --> 10:22.460]  and this is in all the top economic publications. This is not hidden. They know that you are not
[10:22.460 --> 10:28.300]  going to go out and read this information. Of course the Russians basically had spy
[10:28.300 --> 10:33.980]  networkers and I was being sarcastic yesterday when I said fine execute the spies. They don't
[10:33.980 --> 10:39.580]  deserve that. They deserve to be shipped back to Russia. The issue here is I said if you're going
[10:39.580 --> 10:44.220]  to put them in prison, if you're going to punish them, in which they should be punished, because
[10:44.220 --> 10:49.420]  I'm into America. I'm into sovereignty. I'm into the Bill of Rights and Constitution Declaration
[10:49.420 --> 10:54.860]  of Independence because it isn't the perfect system but it's the best system we've ever seen on this
[10:54.860 --> 10:59.740]  planet and the globalists hate it for a good reason because it's diametrically opposed to
[10:59.740 --> 11:06.540]  their mercantilism, their neocolonial feudalism and I'm not going to be part of it. Mercantilism
[11:06.540 --> 11:13.100]  was a system developed by the French around 400 years ago to manage the burgeoning free market
[11:13.100 --> 11:19.100]  that had developed in the birth of the Renaissance and it was a new merchant class that was out
[11:19.100 --> 11:25.500]  competing the nobles and so the nobles came in with a letter of mark type government certification
[11:25.500 --> 11:31.420]  from the crown so that they could be given license to be the only ones operating and they were given
[11:31.420 --> 11:36.860]  monopolies and it was then a political system where they used it to control their colonies
[11:36.860 --> 11:41.580]  and their possessions then it was adopted by the Spanish, the British and others for those that don't
[11:41.580 --> 11:47.820]  know and an example of mercantilism one of the biggest reasons we went to war we're told in 1776
[11:47.820 --> 11:54.620]  it was over a tiny teatax no that was there was a protest against the teatax you know it is the
[11:54.620 --> 12:01.020]  Boston Tea Party when the people from the Green Dragon Inn got drunk and went over and threw millions
[12:01.020 --> 12:05.580]  of dollars in today's numbers of tea into the harbor of British tea they had their own shipments
[12:05.580 --> 12:10.540]  of tea coming in so it was mainly economic sabotage of their own uh saying look you're
[12:10.540 --> 12:17.340]  hurting us selectively enforcing teataxes on American importers colonial importers and and
[12:17.340 --> 12:21.740]  giving um preferential treatment to British importers but but i'm going to digress from that
[12:23.260 --> 12:28.940]  the issue in history is if you know it you're not doomed to repeat it if you know history and then
[12:28.940 --> 12:35.340]  use those lessons to defend yourself and you could not manufacture firearms in the United States
[12:35.340 --> 12:42.940]  you could not manufacture shovels pickaxes buggy whips you could not manufactured any finished
[12:42.940 --> 12:55.500]  good that was considered uh to be um factory built England had factories and the United States
[12:55.500 --> 12:59.500]  which was of course the colonies at the time was not allowed we were allowed to produce raw
[12:59.500 --> 13:11.020]  cotton raw tobacco raw timber uh raw uh corn raw wheat raw maize but if you you weren't allowed
[13:11.020 --> 13:15.900]  to grind it into flour and then ship it abroad you can grind it into flour here there are all
[13:15.900 --> 13:23.740]  these Byzantine rules and government inspectors and see that's how London was able to keep control
[13:23.740 --> 13:28.300]  of not just the 13 colonies but their colonies around the world that's just one example that's
[13:28.300 --> 13:33.580]  one reason the Indians in India revolted in the 20s 30s 40s and finally through the British out in
[13:33.580 --> 13:38.860]  the 50s was because they weren't allowed to have their own businesses they weren't allowed to have
[13:38.860 --> 13:44.540]  their own factories so see globalism they understand what it means to deindustrialize you
[13:44.540 --> 13:50.540]  they weren't stupid oh look globalism failed it shut down all our factories they knew it would
[13:50.540 --> 13:58.540]  cause a giant sucking sound it was designed to do that so they've got these incredibly beautiful
[13:58.540 --> 14:09.100]  Russian women I mean this redhead looks like a supermodel they've show her in New York real estate
[14:11.820 --> 14:17.020]  video interview she did last year and she looks like a movie star she could add a
[14:17.020 --> 14:32.220]  career in Hollywood amazing energy and charisma on top of the dynamite looks and I will tell you
[14:32.220 --> 14:37.740]  right now that it's a 99% chance these are deep cover sleeper cells exactly as the FBI said and
[14:37.740 --> 14:42.060]  the media hadn't told you yet these were sex operatives ladies and gentlemen and I've seen
[14:42.060 --> 14:47.340]  the news going this is a new type of spying this is not a new type of spying the bumbling Russian
[14:47.340 --> 14:56.460]  spying of the 1940s and 50s when for a brief time late 1940s early 50s the US England and Russia
[14:56.460 --> 15:01.340]  were actually at odds with each other that is England the US against Russia because the globalists
[15:01.340 --> 15:06.140]  put the Russians in they put the commies in on record that's now declassified they put Mao in
[15:06.140 --> 15:11.660]  declassified public history channel CIA admits it totally evil that they admit it just like they
[15:11.660 --> 15:15.420]  admit they're growing the opium in Afghanistan they know we're out there exposing it now so
[15:15.420 --> 15:22.060]  they just say okay we admit it big deal let's move on this is how the British round table
[15:22.060 --> 15:28.140]  groups operate this is one of their arsenal and their Swiss army knife is swallows that's the CIA
[15:28.140 --> 15:35.180]  term for a sex operative I'll tell you I've told the story I've been in New York before and had a
[15:35.180 --> 15:39.260]  Russian sex operative try to get me in bed and I was like are you kidding number one I'm married
[15:39.260 --> 15:44.300]  don't cheat on my wife number two you're a Russian spy so that's top trying to give me drinks
[15:45.980 --> 15:50.700]  was that three years ago in a 9-11 thing it's pretty ridiculous I mean and boy she was just
[15:50.700 --> 15:55.340]  coming on coming on even had her handler there I mean it likes to go I mean what do you think I
[15:55.340 --> 15:59.980]  who do you think I am nothing will get in the way of my mission against the New World Order
[16:00.540 --> 16:04.220]  anyways so she wasn't as good looking as this one though
[16:04.220 --> 16:12.220]  God don't tempt me I love my wife and she's a very beautiful person but just keep keep keep it away
[16:15.580 --> 16:18.860]  but continuing oh yeah I've seen some things in my life ladies and gentlemen
[16:19.980 --> 16:23.580]  of course they're Russian spies in fact let me just get into it now then I'll get into the economy
[16:23.580 --> 16:30.380]  since I started off into this spying as networking wall street journal if they were spies their
[16:30.380 --> 16:35.500]  strategy was unorthodox uh really no this is British Intel model they're getting sophisticated
[16:35.500 --> 16:40.460]  instead of directly infiltrating government agencies several of the accused Russian spies
[16:40.460 --> 16:46.060]  apparently tried to glean information by moving in financial and elite circles because there's
[16:46.060 --> 16:51.500]  been a financial coup in America Wall Street runs things of course they were in New York with the
[16:51.500 --> 17:01.420]  criminal bankers are I mean of course I mean who do you think took America over British Intel
[17:01.420 --> 17:07.100]  through US Intel and now the Israelis of course are merged with that because the Rothschild is
[17:07.100 --> 17:12.060]  some of the most powerful people in England it's all one big sickening amalgamation suspect Donald
[17:12.060 --> 17:18.380]  Howard Heathfield people had fake names infiltrated as young people right out of high school for an
[17:18.380 --> 17:22.780]  example graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government well have you looked at who runs America
[17:22.780 --> 17:29.820]  almost every position is is a Harvard alumni and then they go on to Goldman Sachs this is a mafia
[17:31.100 --> 17:38.220]  it's Harvard and then Yale and then Princeton you've got financial the globalist who are
[17:38.220 --> 17:43.420]  international corporate operators who are sucking every country dry of course the Russians infiltrated
[17:43.420 --> 17:50.220]  Harvard of course they try to infiltrate Goldman Sachs this is the illegitimate government the
[17:50.220 --> 17:54.140]  Russians are going to get anything done with a ceremonial Congress the Russians are going
[17:54.140 --> 18:01.820]  to get anything done with a ceremonial president you think peanut or the last guy a bush you think
[18:01.820 --> 18:06.140]  these guys actually run anything they read off teleprompters of course they tried to infiltrate
[18:06.140 --> 18:15.180]  Harvard have you looked at who runs this country bunch of crooks bunch of Ivy League crooks handled
[18:15.180 --> 18:23.820]  by British intelligence God save the Queen all that if they were spies their strategy was unorthodox
[18:23.820 --> 18:29.740]  who do you think we fought a war against to get this country wasn't France and your people that
[18:29.740 --> 18:34.060]  have the freedom fries you like to make fun of on your menus they're the reason we got the country
[18:34.060 --> 18:40.860]  see everything we've been given is a is a Anglo-centric anglophile religion all the French
[18:40.860 --> 18:46.540]  bashing I notice old old movies in the 30s with French bashing because British Intel took this
[18:46.540 --> 18:52.460]  country over that mean the British people they've been taken over by the same system if they were
[18:52.460 --> 18:58.700]  spies their strategy was unorthodox oh you mean like the British taking over Yale in 1832 on record
[18:58.700 --> 19:04.140]  they're scum and bones you mean you mean that unorthodox operation if they were spies their
[19:04.140 --> 19:08.780]  strategy was unorthodox British Intel instead of directly infiltrating government agencies
[19:08.780 --> 19:12.300]  several of the accused Russian spies apparently tried to glean information by moving into financial
[19:12.300 --> 19:19.180]  and elite circles because they run this country suspect Donald Howard Heathfield for example
[19:19.180 --> 19:22.780]  graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and was an energetic network who
[19:22.780 --> 19:27.820]  promoted his consultancy firm future map aimed at governments and businesses former classmates
[19:27.820 --> 19:32.380]  recall what what did the NSA do they started Google to go around getting everybody's info
[19:32.380 --> 19:40.540]  and then and then it's private so the bankers control it that's what globalism is it's it
[19:40.540 --> 19:48.700]  globalism equals treason globalism equals foreign offshore corporate governance I mean
[19:48.700 --> 19:53.660]  have you seen the g20 no matter if it's England Canada the US it's the exact same procedures

[24:43.740 --> 24:47.980]  street journalists either these three writers that wrote this story are morons or they're giving
[24:47.980 --> 24:54.700]  you disinfo and i and i i've got to believe it's disinfo i mean the gentleman that wrote the james
[24:54.700 --> 25:05.180]  bond novels he was a member of os s and then mi6 and in all the movies which have reality woven in
[25:05.180 --> 25:10.620]  all james bond is doing is seducing women spies to have sex with them they're trying to seduce him
[25:10.620 --> 25:16.460]  people are filming it covertly through glass mirrors that's exactly what goes on and then
[25:16.460 --> 25:22.620]  they're wondering oh in the in the newspaper this is never heard of sex operatives oh well
[25:22.620 --> 25:26.860]  cheapest we never heard of that and then other people are running around saying that they were
[25:26.860 --> 25:32.780]  journalists and they just were illegal aliens who had fake deep cover fake marriages to to be
[25:32.780 --> 25:38.460]  reporters i mean that's even more asinine if you believe that i got a bridge i want to sell you
[25:38.460 --> 25:44.540]  but again hyperventilating and they've got former kgb operatives who will who'll just sell out to
[25:44.540 --> 25:50.620]  whoever officer you know money you know now cia disinfo people all over radio and tv going the
[25:50.620 --> 25:56.300]  russians are going to get us the russians are everywhere oh my gosh there's russian spies all
[25:56.300 --> 26:02.540]  over the place ladies and gentlemen what there are are corporate spies all over the place and
[26:02.540 --> 26:10.300]  they already run the government have you read an spp document again judicial watch suden got them
[26:10.300 --> 26:15.340]  and i talk about it all the time because it's so incredible you look at the meeting at baler in 2005
[26:15.340 --> 26:21.980]  the meetings in in mexico in 2006 the meetings in 2007 in banff canada a subsequent documents in
[26:21.980 --> 26:30.860]  2008 and 2009 and 2010 and they arrive at these armored complexes with troops outside guarding
[26:30.860 --> 26:35.660]  them costing hundreds of millions of non-billions like in the case of the g20 and the world leaders
[26:35.660 --> 26:40.700]  sit down and then they have a corporate governance board and they break into subgroups and the
[26:40.700 --> 26:46.300]  corporate leaders come and tell the government what they voted on and then the government says
[26:46.300 --> 26:51.420]  yes sir in the meetings government officials say in the minutes yes sir and then they go and
[26:51.420 --> 26:58.460]  implement it and now is that treason is that a coup d'etat is that a takeover of course it is so
[26:58.460 --> 27:03.820]  of course the russians are trying to infiltrate the corporations of course they're infiltrating
[27:03.820 --> 27:12.940]  harvard where they train the traders what about some of the harvard phd's we've had on
[27:15.420 --> 27:23.100]  like dr francis boil phd international lawyer wrote the us biological weapons treaty for the un
[27:23.900 --> 27:28.780]  he'll tell you he was sent and trained as he was top of his class to be in the one
[27:28.780 --> 27:35.100]  one office of henry kissinger where they get out one phd a year and it was given to him
[27:35.100 --> 27:40.220]  to carry out world government extermination genocide total takeover british intel he'll
[27:40.220 --> 27:46.380]  tell you one person a year and he went and was given that position and was given the full plan
[27:46.380 --> 27:55.180]  and said i'm not going to be part of this that's a powerful defector from the enemy camp to us
[27:55.180 --> 28:03.420]  isn't it he and he's of course in fall the republic but we need defectors from goldman sacks we need
[28:03.420 --> 28:09.980]  defectors from the private fellow reserve we need defectors from bp that's where you get real
[28:09.980 --> 28:16.620]  defectors from you don't get it from russia surrounded imploded on all sides with the bankers
[28:16.620 --> 28:21.500]  trying to get back in and loot because the the old line russian elite are actually able to
[28:21.500 --> 28:26.700]  run that country and they're looting but nothing like the bankers would do because the bankers
[28:26.700 --> 28:31.420]  want to run countries into the ground the russian elite want to use russia as a command base for
[28:31.420 --> 28:37.500]  their own power and control and they do have some russian patriotism but they're still very corrupt
[28:37.500 --> 28:45.260]  from my analysis but compared to the goldman sacks compared to the british intel elite compared to
[28:45.260 --> 28:52.060]  the corporate jenovese mafia black nobility the merger of the italian royal families with the
[28:52.060 --> 28:57.100]  german royal families and the british royal families merged with the roth childs the most
[28:57.100 --> 29:03.660]  cunning people you can imagine has created the ultimate symbiosis of what we now live under
[29:03.660 --> 29:09.100]  and they are as ruthless as anything you can imagine let me tell you how many levels the
[29:09.100 --> 29:16.700]  british intel plays you can read the documents from 1830s 1870s you can read their battle plans from
[29:16.700 --> 29:23.180]  1919 the milner group saying we're going to let germany build back up after incredible sanctions
[29:23.180 --> 29:29.180]  they will then elect a war leader we'll fund them as a dictator we'll encourage the dictator to go
[29:29.180 --> 29:33.740]  wild claim we're going to team up with him and then we'll bring him down and wreck europe and that
[29:33.740 --> 29:40.460]  way i mean how do you deal with people playing in 25 year increments as brzezinski brags they do
[29:42.220 --> 29:46.300]  well you study their battle plans and ask yourself if you want to be enslaved by these people
[29:46.300 --> 29:51.980]  because their end game is killing you and your family they want you dead we're on the march the

[33:05.420 --> 33:10.700]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gc and radio network
[33:12.300 --> 33:16.300]  i haven't said much about the al Gore situation but watching his body language
[33:17.340 --> 33:19.820]  and the way he's been behaving and he always looked like a big fat
[33:19.820 --> 33:27.420]  degenerate rapist to me a lot of times the book cover matches what's inside sometimes it doesn't
[33:29.820 --> 33:34.300]  this could be some type of bizarre false flag where she later comes out admits it's all a fraud
[33:34.300 --> 33:41.100]  is some way to discredit anybody who ever comes out against gore but i don't think that's the
[33:41.100 --> 33:51.500]  case because this is something that's dirty either way you slice it so we will um we will
[33:51.500 --> 33:58.540]  cover that coming up accuser claims key witnesses hotel video surveillance dna evidence gore
[33:58.540 --> 34:05.260]  unequivocally and emphatically denies come on bill clinton i did not have sex with that woman
[34:05.260 --> 34:13.260]  monica lawinsky and he shook his finger and said how dare you how dare you say i did it's a complete
[34:13.260 --> 34:19.740]  lie and see these guys like to force it on somebody he got even more excited reportedly as
[34:19.740 --> 34:23.980]  she said no unless you're trying to get out and he ran over and started hunching on her
[34:26.060 --> 34:29.900]  i want to warn you though we're not going to air all of this tape and we've bleeped out the cuss words
[34:29.900 --> 34:34.220]  we're going to fade them down but still it is graphics so there's any children listening
[34:34.220 --> 34:38.140]  i'm going to play a short clip of this now but i'm going to play more of it next hour
[34:38.140 --> 34:44.540]  here's just a short clip of when it started he grabbed my right hand hard shoved it down
[34:45.260 --> 34:51.740]  under the sheet to his pubic hair area my fingers brushing against his penis and firmly
[34:51.740 --> 34:58.860]  planted my hand on his pubic crest region and said to me there in a very sharp loud angry sounding
[34:58.860 --> 35:05.260]  tone this is all happening really fast as you can imagine further that's enough that's the police
[35:05.260 --> 35:09.820]  deposition they've reopened the criminal investigation see when this happened three years ago he was at
[35:09.820 --> 35:16.140]  the height of his Nobel prize and the worship and people were literally saying he laid golden eggs
[35:16.140 --> 35:21.420]  when he went to the bathroom that i mean this guy could do nothing wrong he was like the second
[35:21.420 --> 35:28.700]  coming of christ all rolled into one and uh and and an easter bunny and the golden goes i mean he
[35:28.700 --> 35:36.860]  was like god he was a saint and uh really he was a big man bear pig he was the guy that sold you that
[35:36.860 --> 35:42.460]  naphtha and gat was going to be great this is a good deal larry let me cover that and follow the
[35:42.460 --> 35:49.260]  republic this deal is going to really mold new factories in the united states larry shut up
[35:49.260 --> 35:55.980]  ross this is my time to speak let me let me speak in my big you know fake southern nelly accent here
[35:55.980 --> 36:08.140]  for you i was an afton got a good deal for you america did bill clinton not have sex with that
[36:08.140 --> 36:15.980]  woman monica lawinsky do they not lie and notice how he was real quiet about this in 2006 it came
[36:15.980 --> 36:21.260]  out then when it first happened i guess four years ago and then he was uh real quiet the last two
[36:21.260 --> 36:26.220]  weeks about it and that's suspicious when even though it was big news and now he's had to deny
[36:27.100 --> 36:32.780]  but but notice he he doesn't say in in words like no she's a liar because he didn't want to encourage
[36:32.780 --> 36:37.580]  her to get more angry he doesn't say she's scum she wanted money she's a fraud she's a criminal
[36:37.580 --> 36:42.140]  he says i unequivocally and emphatically deny because he knows the general public doesn't even
[36:42.140 --> 36:46.700]  know what unequivocally or emphatically means when they use a lawyer term like that a long word
[36:46.700 --> 36:51.660]  that's what he later could say i did touch her but she touched me and i i'm in an unequivocally and
[36:51.660 --> 36:55.820]  emphatically deny that i tried to force her oh i mean what do you think his wife's leaving him
[36:58.220 --> 37:01.660]  all right i'm already getting into this i said i get into it next hour because i got the financial
[37:01.660 --> 37:07.740]  news it's the top story the iran situation the latest on the oil spill what happened with charlie
[37:07.740 --> 37:14.060]  veitch he emailed us and he said look i'll come on if you want the fellow arrested twice in toronto
[37:16.620 --> 37:19.980]  but he said i want to get out of canada first and i said yeah let's just not have you on
[37:19.980 --> 37:24.380]  till you get back to england you know why because when they screamed at me for 15 hours and threatened
[37:24.380 --> 37:30.780]  to set me up and put me in prison when i was there cover bill deberg in 2006 in ottawa this was in
[37:30.780 --> 37:36.140]  toronto about 50 miles away when the media found that i was there and showed up they went from
[37:36.140 --> 37:41.100]  screaming and cushing and saying i was going to go to toronto prison and all the rest of it and
[37:41.820 --> 37:47.740]  trying to get me to say i was basically a terrorist and trying to get my guys to say that
[37:47.740 --> 37:51.500]  they were terrorists and i was a terrorist then they got scared and the head guy came and he said
[37:51.500 --> 37:56.620]  i have daughters he started starting to cry a little he said please please don't talk bad about
[37:56.620 --> 38:02.380]  me and then i said uh well you know what buddy i just want to be able to cover this and he said
[38:02.380 --> 38:07.020]  and he shifted into you know good cop bad cop he went back in the back up he said you'll have to
[38:07.020 --> 38:10.620]  leave you know and we've got people outside the police force you don't know what could happen
[38:11.580 --> 38:19.100]  and then i realized oh this guy's really dangerous and so um i said well
[38:22.780 --> 38:26.300]  i'll try to go easy on you and they started crying again and it was all fake
[38:26.300 --> 38:33.580]  i mean these people are lunatics i mean this bully uh acted real tough uh until um
[38:35.740 --> 38:39.820]  until the media got there and then he just went to pieces so i would imagine they were telling him
[38:39.820 --> 38:43.500]  you got to come back in august for your court date even though you're pleading not guilty
[38:44.460 --> 38:50.460]  and uh you better watch it things can happen boy and so i don't see how he can even talk
[38:50.460 --> 38:55.100]  once he gets to england in my experience if he goes along with them and licks their boots
[38:55.100 --> 38:59.420]  they're gonna probably set him up even worse once he gets there they're like good we got him
[38:59.420 --> 39:03.980]  where we want him let's throw the book at him i mean charlie buddy they'll plant drugs on you
[39:03.980 --> 39:08.140]  there's there's there's no end to these people you've got all the reports coming out now by women
[39:08.140 --> 39:14.380]  that they threaten to rape them and uh during the quote enhanced strip search men did penetrate them
[39:14.380 --> 39:22.940]  with their fingers so uh oh and the police didn't rape that fella with a plunger for two hours
[39:22.940 --> 39:28.540]  either with blood pouring out they did a good cop finally blew the whistle of course cops would
[39:28.540 --> 39:33.740]  say he was the bad cop who would want to rape somebody for two hours with a plunger i mean even
[39:33.740 --> 39:37.900]  if you were a sadistic rapist that would get kind of old wouldn't it but not to a demon
[39:38.860 --> 39:49.020]  two hours raping with a toilet plunger i mean i i want to support the police i want to but i mean
[39:49.020 --> 39:57.660]  come on come on all right now i'm digressing again i want to finish up on the russian spy situation
[39:57.660 --> 40:02.460]  and really make it clear how this is a great illustration of how the media hyperventilates
[40:02.460 --> 40:09.580]  over a a threat yeah it's like one fire ant biting you versus a thousand one fire ant can't kill you
[40:09.580 --> 40:13.420]  a thousand can let me tell you something we got a thousand golden sacks fire ants on us
[40:13.420 --> 40:19.900]  and we got one russian ant on us and the crazy lunatic golden sacks ants want to have a war
[40:19.900 --> 40:25.580]  with russia they they're so full of hootspa that they want to do that and we have got to stop it

[42:45.900 --> 42:52.700]  in the new movie twilight that's the type of softball moron comments that they asked the penguin
[42:52.700 --> 42:58.620]  uh because i'm wrong she doesn't look like john wangasey she looks like the penguin have you seen
[42:58.620 --> 43:03.580]  danie davido as the penguin we had a alex jones channel video that dav put up and he found an
[43:03.580 --> 43:13.580]  image of the penguin uh from the 1990s batman film danie davido and i'm not kidding it is her
[43:13.580 --> 43:17.180]  she would not even need makeup to play the part of the penguin and i shouldn't attack over how she
[43:17.180 --> 43:24.380]  looks it's just why do we have to have uh i mean look it doesn't really bother me there'll be no
[43:24.380 --> 43:29.340]  protestants even though that's the biggest religion in the united states on on them even though i'm a
[43:29.340 --> 43:34.300]  protestant on i mean in the political correct world it's not the content of your mind or your deeds
[43:34.300 --> 43:40.060]  it's what group you're part of so why isn't the court half protestant then you find lots of black
[43:40.060 --> 43:44.460]  guys that are protestant you know so you can get that quota done have some black guys have some
[43:44.460 --> 43:50.620]  protestants but no and i don't even get upset that you'll have you know two jews on the court uh and
[43:50.620 --> 43:57.820]  no protestants if she was pro second amendment pro property rights and not an admitted socialist
[43:57.820 --> 44:06.540]  that wouldn't be a problem but will the whole court end up being hunchbacked lesbians i mean you know
[44:06.540 --> 44:14.220]  sota mayor and uh and uh kagan i mean again i don't even dislike lesbians i don't i don't hate people
[44:14.220 --> 44:19.660]  for what what they're into i don't i mean but i mean come on i mean is america to be i mean
[44:19.660 --> 44:25.100]  what's going on with uh the uh head of homeland security well what was going on with janet rino
[44:25.100 --> 44:32.380]  janet rino was in a court case and it came out in the miami and other papers that she was constantly
[44:32.380 --> 44:37.500]  being caught with underage girls and once in the back of a convertible and that she'd vomited
[44:37.500 --> 44:42.620]  all over the 13-year-old girl that she checked out of the cps i mean that's that's on record
[44:42.620 --> 44:47.100]  that rino was doing stuff like this and they said my gosh this woman's completely compromised let's
[44:47.100 --> 44:53.820]  make her because she was controlled by the mafia in miami and surrounding areas uh let's make her
[44:53.820 --> 45:01.500]  this corrupt da let's make her the attorney general and see let's get it out in the open
[45:01.500 --> 45:08.300]  kagan's sexual persuasion let's get rino's out in the open let's get sota mayors out in the open
[45:08.300 --> 45:12.620]  see but they don't want it out in the open because once it's out in the open they can't blackmail
[45:12.620 --> 45:19.100]  them with it it's not that she's a lesbian it's not that sota mayor is it's not the janet rino was
[45:20.220 --> 45:29.900]  the reason they put these women in there is because they can destroy them anytime they want
[45:29.900 --> 45:34.540]  remember senator lindsey graham the head of alley pat comes out and says it's it's well known in
[45:34.540 --> 45:41.260]  washington that this guy uh is is part of the republican uh gay coalition i mean that that
[45:41.260 --> 45:44.940]  literally is probably more than half the republican congressman it's unbelievable i mean how many have
[45:44.940 --> 45:49.500]  been caught in bathrooms and running around and how many deputy heads of homeland security trying
[45:49.500 --> 45:54.780]  to get in bed with little kids and i mean it just goes i mean barney frank was caught in the late
[45:54.780 --> 45:59.420]  eighties running an underage brothel out of his house out of his townhouse it didn't get in trouble
[45:59.420 --> 46:02.540]  because he went and gave a press conference and said you dropped this right now i'm blowing the
[46:02.540 --> 46:08.700]  whistle on everybody and they dropped it so you know i mean if frank is gay that's his own issue
[46:08.700 --> 46:13.260]  i don't dislike him for that i mean that's his his his his right but he is he he does
[46:14.060 --> 46:18.860]  had underage teenagers in there he needs to get in trouble for that but see if he goes down they
[46:18.860 --> 46:24.300]  all go down and he's the rare democrat who's gay i guess uh the issue here i mean it tends to look
[46:24.300 --> 46:29.260]  at gore going after women over here but it's bad whether he was trying to force it on a male masseuse
[46:29.260 --> 46:38.460]  or a female masseuse you know it it's wrong but you notice as soon as it came out that
[46:38.460 --> 46:43.100]  lindsey grand was being blackmailed for his homosexuality it must have felt really good to
[46:43.100 --> 46:47.500]  him to be able to not have it over his head and now he can be reelected he came out and said i'm
[46:47.500 --> 46:53.820]  against cap and trade i'm against amnesty i'm against all the things i was for that weight
[46:53.820 --> 46:59.660]  must have felt really good off his shoulders ladies and gentlemen that weight must have felt
[46:59.660 --> 47:05.100]  really good for him well that weight is on kegan it's on sotomayor it's on all these
[47:05.100 --> 47:10.220]  single women i mean you can go search engine in fact search engine i i didn't cover this a month
[47:10.220 --> 47:14.860]  ago i should have you can find her at parties at bar parties with you know beautiful women
[47:15.740 --> 47:21.660]  and you know smiling like like a guy would smile if he was with a beauty queen you know i mean if
[47:21.660 --> 47:25.740]  i was with miss oklahoma saying uh at an event and i put my arm she put her arm around me i'd
[47:25.740 --> 47:32.060]  probably blush well you know that's kegan blushing with some beautiful you know lipstick type person
[47:32.060 --> 47:36.780]  and uh you know she's a bull you know what person and you know that's what she likes i mean look she
[47:36.780 --> 47:42.060]  wants to wear pants you know she would never wear makeup and earrings and stuff i mean she's a tomboy
[47:42.060 --> 47:49.260]  that's that's her issue she likes women i like women i mean i'm not i think the gay lifestyle
[47:49.260 --> 47:55.340]  is destructive i think it's bad i i but i don't judge these people or hate them but the issue is
[47:55.340 --> 48:00.220]  she's being blackmailed ladies and gentlemen you better believe it you better believe that i trust
[48:00.220 --> 48:04.620]  wane mattes and other investigative reporters and they say the word is barack obama is a bisexual
[48:05.340 --> 48:11.260]  and they are blackmailing him with that this is how they control people ladies and gentlemen
[48:11.260 --> 48:16.460]  and we can't have presidents and we can't have supreme court justices and heads of homeland
[48:16.460 --> 48:22.540]  security and heads of justice departments who are homosexual and are being blackmailed so kegan
[48:22.540 --> 48:28.620]  come out of the closet admit you're a lesbian admit that that was what you advocated for and that
[48:28.620 --> 48:32.540]  was the group that you constantly wrote about and what you were obsessed with when you were in the
[48:32.540 --> 48:38.700]  white house and when you were solicitor general admit that you are a homosexual activist admit
[48:38.700 --> 48:45.980]  that that's your entire life i don't have a lot of respect for you okay but see you're not gonna do
[48:45.980 --> 48:52.300]  it so i'm gonna say today on air what nobody else will say okay the supreme court will become 100
[48:52.300 --> 48:58.620]  percent bull dykes if we don't do something about this i'm sick of it okay and that woman
[48:59.820 --> 49:05.980]  that woman wants our guns and she wants our private property and she wants everything and she
[49:05.980 --> 49:11.580]  doesn't like families and she doesn't like heterosexuals and she's shown that as part of her record
[49:11.580 --> 49:16.780]  and i'm not putting up with it anymore is that understood i'm not going along with it anymore
[49:17.660 --> 49:24.060]  okay and and that's the term that these gay groups use for each other i was watching some
[49:24.060 --> 49:29.340]  group in a protest that got beat up at the g20 and it was wrong uh you know they call themselves
[49:29.340 --> 49:33.820]  the queers and then they can call themselves that nobody else is supposed to i mean those are the
[49:33.820 --> 49:39.020]  terms they use for themselves on their social networking sites and everywhere else and so
[49:39.020 --> 49:46.620]  i'll call it what it is okay and i'm tired of the cps hunting heterosexual families
[49:46.620 --> 49:52.460]  now on record now even mainstream news in england london telegraph top reporters that they go to
[49:52.460 --> 49:56.940]  heterosexual families and take their children to give them to the families of gays and lesbians
[49:56.940 --> 50:03.020]  stop hunting us again i'm not against these people but i'm against the aberrant extreme groups out
[50:03.020 --> 50:09.660]  there that are hunting that are hunting heterosexuals it's like planted the apes and i'm being hunted
[50:09.660 --> 50:12.460]  and i've had enough and your political correctness doesn't work on me anymore
[50:14.780 --> 50:19.820]  so i've been clear about it now and i've committed the great cardinal sin of talking about about
[50:19.820 --> 50:25.020]  kagan and the question to the supreme court nominee elena kagan was are you a vampire
[50:25.020 --> 50:31.420]  or are you a werewolf and she's neither what she is is a clone of janet rino and that's why
[50:31.420 --> 50:41.180]  she's in there i mean these women are all lookalikes napolitano kagan soda mayor um janet rino
[50:42.460 --> 50:46.540]  and we're under we're so paralyzed by political correctness we're not we're missing it the forest
[50:46.540 --> 50:53.740]  for the trees here it isn't that they're lesbians it's that they're compromised and they're being
[50:53.740 --> 50:58.220]  blackmailed and they're forming a power cult just like rome founded these cults

[54:17.740 --> 54:23.180]  that there should be no second amendment chicago mayor daly's office argued in that court case
[54:23.180 --> 54:28.860]  no one is allowed to own guns with the police highest crime rate in the country just spinning
[54:28.860 --> 54:33.980]  out of control criminals don't follow law law abiding citizens when they do have sneak a gun
[54:33.980 --> 54:39.020]  into chicago it's almost always some old lady or soul some old man defend themselves they send
[54:39.020 --> 54:47.740]  them to prison they arrest them for defending themselves this is incredible and these people
[54:47.740 --> 54:51.740]  want to disarm us they say we don't have a right to our private property we don't have a right to
[54:51.740 --> 54:57.500]  our free speech to our guns and why are they doing it because they're being blackmailed ladies and
[54:57.500 --> 55:04.780]  gentlemen we cannot have supreme court justices that are involved in gambling i'm not against
[55:04.780 --> 55:09.180]  people that gamble i think you can get out of control and be destructive that's not bigoted
[55:09.180 --> 55:18.220]  to be against gambling any more so than i don't dislike gay people i don't dislike you know i
[55:18.220 --> 55:21.500]  don't hate them i understand they're human beings i understand they're attracted to what they're
[55:21.500 --> 55:27.740]  attracted to i don't like the other weird behaviors that come out of the gun grabbing the land
[55:27.740 --> 55:32.380]  grabbing the you know as part of that group that's what on average they do leave me alone
[55:34.860 --> 55:38.380]  i don't like the fact that so many of the cps workers are homosexuals coming out people's
[55:38.380 --> 55:43.580]  kids it's it's creepy let's just let's just tell it like it is and i don't like the fact that
[55:43.580 --> 55:48.300]  lindsay graham and all these people are being blackmailed just like if they had a gambling problem
[55:48.300 --> 55:53.180]  just like if they had taken bribes they're now compromised and if the media made it out on the
[55:53.180 --> 55:58.940]  open that you know joining a long history of other lesbians on the court i mean she's certainly not
[55:58.940 --> 56:06.620]  the first so do my oars not the first and why do they pick these lesbian lawyers because they can
[56:06.620 --> 56:11.340]  destroy them whenever they want because they're not making it public that they're lesbians
[56:11.340 --> 56:18.780]  just like lindsay graham is gay and boy that didn't prove it they said mr graham we've got all the
[56:18.780 --> 56:25.020]  proof you're gay and you're being blackmailed you better stop being for the carbon tax and the open
[56:25.020 --> 56:29.820]  borders and the banker takeover or we're gonna bring it all out in the open and one day later
[56:29.820 --> 56:34.300]  that's it i i i'm not further than any of this anymore i mean why would graham do things that
[56:34.300 --> 56:38.700]  are so unpopular in his state that he was assured to lose and it's still assured to lose
[56:38.700 --> 56:44.540]  why would he commit political suicide as a senator
[56:47.020 --> 56:52.780]  because ladies and gentlemen it's true and the gay club got him into the republican
[56:53.340 --> 57:00.620]  bathhouse it's basically what it is and again why is the congress when when gay men are supposedly
[57:00.620 --> 57:05.580]  three percent of the population why are so many republicans gay because they recruit each other
[57:05.580 --> 57:11.420]  they're like you're compromised now into our criminal club that's why when you go to bohemian
[57:11.420 --> 57:16.700]  grove as richard nixon said on record they try to make you have gay sex because it's an it's a
[57:16.700 --> 57:23.260]  rite of passage okay buddy we can tell your wife now that you you know had sex with these gay porn
[57:23.260 --> 57:29.500]  stars we brought in if you don't play ball with us you understand that ladies and gentlemen it's a
[57:29.500 --> 57:36.620]  cult you may have some you know gay doctor down the street that you know that you that your friends
[57:36.620 --> 57:43.180]  with you play golf with whatever he's not a bad person but these these groups up in washington
[57:43.180 --> 57:46.620]  i mean pretty soon you won't be able to be in congress unless you're gay you won't be able to
[57:46.620 --> 57:51.020]  be on the supreme court unless you're gay you won't be able to i mean what is every big everything's
[57:51.020 --> 57:59.580]  got to be run by gay people i mean this is becoming a total takeover of society and i'll just say it i
[57:59.580 --> 58:04.220]  mean you're worried about a russian takeover of america because 11 spies trying to infiltrate
[58:04.220 --> 58:10.060]  harvard because they know what runs america it's cliques run america mafias run america you got

[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:11.100]  liking what my human programming is and i pointed out at the end of the hour that we have weird
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:16.540]  cults taken over america and mafias and they've divided the country up amongst themselves and
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:21.500]  they're trying to force everybody else to to basically buy into their cultures and i just
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:29.260]  want to be left alone but the entire system of deviance as many would call them they see those
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:35.740]  of us who are normal as the deviance see that's the issue i'm the weirdo because i'm not scared of

[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:16.140]  turned into a bunch of weak domesticated people that doesn't know which end is up but here's the
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:21.580]  deal the majority of americans know they want a red blooded lifestyle as well and now they're
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:26.140]  understanding that they they gave in to whatever they were told to go along with you know they gave
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.300]  in to all the political correctness and the politically correct armies want to make us their
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:35.260]  slaves they want to run us over they want to conquer us they didn't want to live in peace they
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:41.020]  want to run our lives they want power they want to take over our families and harvest our children
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:46.780]  like a farmer takes eggs from a hen and that isn't going to happen you understand you've picked a
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:54.300]  fight new world order that you're going to lose oh man i'm going to come back and get into the
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:59.100]  economy i'm going to get into the oil spill i'm going to get into the latest developments on iran
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.860]  it just gets more and more serious as we track this it's all coming up today and ron paul's
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:09.260]  schedule is coming up in the last 30 minutes of this broadcast today but i'll go back to this russian
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:14.940]  spy article spying as networking wall street journal if they were spies their strategy was
[01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:19.500]  an orthodox instead of directly infiltrating government agencies several of the accused russian
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:23.980]  spies apparently tried to glean information by moving in financial elite circles one of them
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:34.060]  graduated top of their class from harvard kennedy school and it goes on from there and they tried
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.700]  to set up computer companies and social networking systems well that's what the british slash new
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:45.020]  world order intel does the power has been transferred to the private banks and megacorporations they tell
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:50.060]  the government what to do so of course the russians tried to infiltrate harvard and tried to infiltrate
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:56.540]  computer companies and of course they did it with super good looking women how do you think a lot
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:04.780]  of other women get to the top of these corporations they sex their way up to the top and so this is
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:10.700]  not unorthodox this is actually how real intelligence is carried out and of course their russian spies
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:16.780]  moved here illegally assumed fake names operated for over a decade and i've heard the neocons
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:23.020]  blaming obama for this i hate obama's guts but they're saying he allowed the russians when it's
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:27.980]  admittedly a 10-year program first they said seven now 10 now 15 these are sleeper cells
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.620]  and they didn't try to get into the intelligence committee of the congress did they
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:37.820]  know they tried to get into harvard because it's that little mafia running things it's a bunch of
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:43.900]  stinking mafias like gerol salente tells you oh i'm not against italians i'm against the italian
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.620]  mafia not against the russian people i'm against their mafia i'm not against the british people
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:53.180]  i'm against their crime syndicate government mafia not against jews i'm against their mafia
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:58.380]  understand that it's mafias it's criminals we're dealing with we'll be right back

[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:21.580]  be he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:29.740]  mr jones my name is chris but i'm a west virginia resident i'm calling you in regards to your
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:37.740]  comments about our dearly departed senator robert seabird although mr bird was a former
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:45.740]  clan member at the time of his death he enjoyed a 100 approval rating for the n double acp
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:54.780]  for his voting record i would figure if the largest group of black people in the united
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:09:02.140]  states armed together in a political cause could forgive the senator his past discretions a white
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:09.980]  fella from the middle of texas could see fit to do the same you claim to be a constitutional
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:18.060]  supporter the biggest constitutional supporter this republic has had for almost 60 years served
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:25.180]  in the senate and his name was robert seabird i heard about the enemy belligerent act on your
[01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:35.980]  show i wrote my senator robert seabird about that he sent me a letter back on may third this year
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:41.500]  probably one of the last letters he ever wrote to tell me that he would stand against the enemy
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:50.380]  belligerent act i've heard people say bad things about their enemies on radio and television but
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:57.580]  i would figure in a time when the liberty movement needs to be consolidated not picked apart from
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:05.420]  the inside you would take a man who west virginia consider to be the ron paul of our state and drag
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:13.340]  his name through the mud before we've had the chance to get him in the ground i'll be attending
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:19.900]  his funeral on friday and sir i'd like to let you know that you would do well to keep yourself
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:27.500]  outside of west virginia for that event we would rather not hear from an individual who wants to
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:35.980]  call our dearly departed senator a monster did you hear that territorialism i'm sitting here
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:44.060]  in texas i never said i was going to his funeral i wouldn't do such a thing and this guy so he can
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:50.940]  like have an excuse to threaten me say you better not come around here boy well number one we love
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:55.500]  west virginia this is a beautiful state a lot of great people you have the very wicked senator j
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:11:01.740]  rockefeller you're going to tell me how great he is now bird was a mixed bag there are certainly
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:05.980]  people worse on the senate and i know he did speak out against warrantless spying torture
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:12.300]  and the enemy belligerent act and the rest of it to secretly arrest us citizens that said having
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:21.500]  the n double acp uh say he's the best guy out there is a negative in my scorebook the n double acp
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:31.100]  is an anti gun pro abortion anti black organization and if you did some research on eugenics you'd
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:37.740]  know that so i really don't know what to say to you you don't hear the n double acp talking about
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:43.900]  51% of black people never being born do you do you sir now look i probably was a little hard on
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:48.700]  bird i never really talked about bird uh you know the guy died and i said he's probably going to go
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:58.060]  to hell i said i'm not god and i'm not judging him uh but uh he's a gun grabber in his votes
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:03.820]  a bunch of stuff i mean he was a mixed bag he was a liberal and i'm just gonna tell you right now
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:08.780]  i don't like him or j rockefeller show west virginia one of your senators is dead maybe
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:14.940]  you can elect somebody good a real ron paul and uh j rockefeller you couldn't have a worse senator
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:23.100]  i mean he is what he is now the head of the the rockefeller crime family literally he is now taking
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:29.100]  the range from david who's what 95 years old and uh now becoming a little bit incoherent
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:36.220]  a few years ago he was still well spoken i had a chance to hear a phone message of him i was staying
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:43.980]  um in a hotel nearby and uh one of the other activists called up the hotel at five a.m got
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:49.900]  david rockefeller's room it was david rockefeller had a lengthy conversation with him about the new
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:59.340]  world order and rockefeller said he had to go and then the guy chickened out on ever playing it which
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:03.420]  was ridiculous because he'd heard tucker talk about on this show how he'd called rockefeller's
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:13.580]  room before see no one thinks to be bold but the word is that j is now the true governor
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:19.980]  of the united states he is the true corporate president of the conquered united states
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:28.140]  all right i'm going to give the toll free number out to join us on this uh july 1st 2010
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:37.820]  addition 1-800-259-9231 we can talk about al gore the police have reopened the sexual molestation
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:47.180]  case we can talk about the iran situation the bp situation we can talk about the russian spy info
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:52.540]  any of it but just to to put a book in on the russian spy thing and then i'm done talking about it
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:59.980]  at least for today because i haven't really covered the last two days spying as networking
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:05.260]  if they were spies their strategy was unorthodox the wall street journal wrote instead of directly
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:09.740]  infiltrating government agencies several of the accused russian spies apparently tried to glean
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:17.420]  information by moving in financial elite circles suspect donald howard heathfield for example
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:22.060]  graduated from harvard's kennedy school of government and was an energetic networker
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:30.140]  who promoted his consultancy firm future map aimed at governments and business former classmates
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:37.900]  recall by the way i said we go live this hour on tv and we forgot to so we'll go live at the bottom
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:44.940]  of the hour in 15 minutes we're gonna go live at the bottom of the hour in 15 minutes simulcasting
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:54.380]  the live radio show at prisonplanet.tv looking back they say that a telling sign may have been
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:15:01.500]  mr heathfield's vagueness while describing the business activities of his firm i always thought
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:05.820]  he was hustling put a lot of energy into his new clients for future maps said craig sandler
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:12.860]  mr heathfield's classmate at harvard school kennedy school who now owns state house news
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:18.220]  service in boston but it was never really clear how future map did what it was supposed to do
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:23.980]  it was excellent about concepts not specifics he never went into specifics and it goes on
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:28.140]  to describe uh the the the beautiful redhead and other beautiful women and how they were
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:34.460]  networking and had all this money from europe this is a global government run by corporations
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:40.220]  like the movie rollerball they throw it in your face with that 1970s movie with james gone and so
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:44.300]  you don't infiltrate the puppet congress 94 percent of the bills are never even read
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:50.220]  according to senator de ment and that's on record with other senators and congress members
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:56.620]  you infiltrate corporations that's the government you infiltrate harvard the main organization
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.620]  unit where they teach them about world government they teach them how everybody else is scum and
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:05.660]  stupid and trash in these business schools in these government schools on record how a world
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:10.460]  government's needed how eugenics is good how they're part of the elite how when they start a newspaper
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:15.180]  or computer company or facebook or google or whatever the case is that they're going to instantly get
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:22.140]  it government front company funding like cia funding publicly through in cutel of google's founding
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:30.940]  and how if they just play ball and are sickening traders to america and help bring down america
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:35.820]  they're going to be given lots of money and power and they're a snickering arrogant from
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:42.060]  scum families that hate this country you want to talk about russian spies why were the russians
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:48.460]  infiltrating the scum organizations because that's how you get russian interest that's what a russian
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:57.740]  patriot would do if our fbi and cia weren't run by harvard yale and uh other scum from princeton
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:03.260]  and that doesn't mean if you're a harvard doctor you know you're into vaccines and socialism but
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:07.660]  you're not a you know a trader it's it's the business school it's the tech it's the it's the
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:13.260]  government school it's the kennedy school groups they're openly globalist and we've had top phd's
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:21.180]  from harvard where you have special phd's were one is issued a year on like dr boil francis boil
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:25.660]  to tell you he was taught bring down america british intelligence world government enslave
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:31.500]  everyone i had national british magazine here and they were saying no we didn't believe you about
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:36.140]  the new old order till we talked to some top harvard you know graduates who are globalists and they
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:40.300]  said yes we're gonna get a world government we're gonna enslave everybody we we're into eugenics
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:44.860]  we're gonna live forever you're gonna be killed i mean imagine telling top british reporters this
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:51.660]  this is how arrogant this scum is okay so of course the russians tried to infiltrate it
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:58.780]  because they understand the ballgame they understand america has been taken down
[01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:05.740]  they understand that ladies and gentlemen they understand america is now an engine of offshore
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:11.180]  banks that are destroying us they have the same banks take them over when the soviet union fell
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:17.740]  entirely and steal everything and lover hate putin and medvedev and the but once yeltsin the
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:23.020]  drunken puppet was out of commission they took over and kicked the bankers out and took over the
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:28.460]  op themselves and said hey you've been paid not to have kids we're going to pay you to have kids
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:33.420]  because russia lost close to 30 of its population and they said we're against you know the new world
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:37.980]  order of course they play both sides and are completely corrupt the issue is is that yes
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:43.820]  we don't need russian spies in america but give me a stinking break it came out in mainstream
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:49.020]  newspapers new york times yorker magazine something we reported before that you know it
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:55.020]  came out mainstream news that israeli intelligence actually created the special
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:19:01.020]  office in the pentagon the special working group to make up intelligence on iraq because
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:05.180]  they wanted the u.s to hit iraq you had the weapons industry wanted it and the oil companies wanted
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:11.500]  it as well and notice now that they have it they're giving it to china and europe these are globalist
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:18.780]  it's all about bringing america down our boys bleed and die the offshore banks and globalist get the
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:25.580]  oil because china needs the oil for its factories to build the widgets to deindustrialize us but
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:31.260]  notice china can't have oil that's on its border in turkmenistan who speaks usbekistan pakistan
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:35.420]  afghanistan they can only have oil from thousands of miles away that's shipped to them by the
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:47.980]  globalist it's all about strategic balance and so this is the bottom line globalism is treason
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:52.860]  globalism is the criminal overthrow of america and your financial and physical enslavement
[01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:57.340]  to a bunch of trash that bought off our universities with endowments and are now

[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:46.220]  coming up in about seven minutes at the bottom of the hour and i will continue with your phone
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:51.820]  calls at that point but i need to first get into the financial news and the latest on the hurricane
[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:59.740]  then we'll cover of course what's happening in iran al gore uh criminal case reopened against him
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:06.940]  because now he's not teflon now he's not seen as god now we know that his Nobel prize is a fraud
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:11.900]  and global warming is a fraud he is politically mortally wounded as i've told you in the last
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:18.380]  year everywhere he goes he is bullhorned and hounded and exposes a fraud and who kicked that off
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:25.420]  my listeners we are change great patriots we're not left or right we're seeking the truth and
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:31.100]  justice does that mean we're always right no but our heart is in the right place let's go
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:36.220]  ahead and take calls matt in minnesota then mark ernie ted and others you're on the air
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:42.300]  hey alex hello my friend hey when we're when you're talking about seeking truth and justice and
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:48.460]  you know man-made climate change now gore's nonsense um i think it's important for everybody to
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:54.220]  to take the strategy of um aligning yourself with science because whether you're talking about
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:26:02.860]  jfk 9-11 or man-made climate change um in order to believe all the official stories of these concepts
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:09.180]  these events you have to completely sell out your values on science the the official stories for jfk
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:14.620]  9-11 man-made climate change they they do not follow the scientific method their anti-science
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:20.700]  and after examining all the evidence i mean you would just have to be a complete idiot to believe
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:26.220]  this stuff and i think it's important that uh when people are talking about uh spreading the
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:33.980]  truth through the infowar um that they they apply science to their argument um and and and debunking
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:38.860]  these theories especially with miss and 9-11 i mean the mist reports are a joke and i heard
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:43.020]  you talking a little bit about that on the opium anthony show and i thought that was a pretty good
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:49.820]  discussion well i mean i think it's important to use science when you're well grounded in it on
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:54.700]  subject by subject but just overall it's important to point out to people that look we're living in
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:27:00.540]  tyranny government gets caught lying nine times out of ten they're not being truthful we know
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:07.340]  special interests are robbing us i mean for heaven's sakes they're now in cnn reuters ap
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:13.100]  yesterday announcing they're gonna devalue the dollar and it plunged today and create a new
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:19.340]  global s dr as we told listeners years ago because the globalist said they would this is high treason
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:26.060]  this is criminal having the president and geithner and others in speeches say that they do support
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:33.420]  moving to s dr's i mean this is outrageous that's the real spies but they're goldman sacks corporate
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:39.500]  spies and we need this idea to get out there because the russians know what to infiltrate well how
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:45.980]  about the american people publicly call for these corporations that are destroying our sovereignty
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:50.620]  to be arrested you know to have the people heading this up that have committed all these crimes
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:55.100]  to be i mean listen they had of goldman sacks the goldman sacks division leaders they've had
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:01.420]  congressional hearings they've all committed crimes much bigger than madeoff did clap them in
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:07.020]  irons remove their criminal system or they're going to continue to have financial terrorism
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:14.460]  from the shadows and get away with all this it's either us or them us or them they will wreck us
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:22.380]  and reduce us to the equivalent of mexico or nigeria we must remove them they will destroy us it is
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:28.460]  their economic weapon of conquest to make you poor in the process of transferring your wealth to them
[01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:34.300]  they want you starving so you can't strike back and take your government back and haul them up

[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:09.820]  we reported on this a year and a half ago and actually sent reporters to california
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:16.460]  and got reports from uh hawaii where they're trying to lock people up at night who are homeless
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:20.780]  and not let them live in tense cities that's one step away from concentration camps california is

[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:36.220]  city and just thousands and thousands of people the star advertiser funny the advertiser reported
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:41.580]  eight days before i have a copy of it pearl harbor that they were going to attack on the
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:47.740]  december 7th they'd they'd even gotten the intel and then the base was ordered to stand down and
[01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:54.140]  they follow orders in the in the navy and the marines and army you know you see a newspaper
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:58.940]  you remember all the other headlines yeah it was uh the honolulu advertiser at the time it's been
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:04.540]  changed to the star advertiser but same paper i'm told uh so uh just a little side note there
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:13.660]  continuing dollar should be replaced as international standard un report says i i
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:18.780]  covered this some yesterday but you just can't michelle bachman came out yesterday morning on a
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:23.260]  radio show and quoted from this a global government being established by the imf world bank you'll
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:27.580]  pay your carbon taxes too and they will now as i told you years ago still have the dollar the
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:32.700]  article says that but it'll be denominated and pegged to an international board of private banks
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:38.220]  who you will then pay taxes to for the right to hold dollars or to have new currency issue
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:43.900]  or credit issue so this before the the private bankers had to act through national governments
[01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:48.940]  but now they've taken those over so now they're just transcending borders completely and are
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:52.700]  building their world government openly and sucking the nation states completely dry
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:39:00.540]  like nasferatu would one of his victims they've gone from sucking individuals dry to just sucking
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:05.820]  everyone dry yeah there it is japanese may strike over weekend and that's the honolulu
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:13.020]  advertiser how did you guys find that so fast and that that date was actually eight days before
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:19.260]  people ask well how because they were giving japanese time which was a day earlier but yeah
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:25.740]  there it is uh japanese may strike over weekend and they list december 7th 1941 a day that will
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:30.860]  live in infamy so we had patriots in the navy patriots in the army patriots in the marines
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:35.420]  they'd broken the japanese purple and blue coat a year before the british had given it to the
[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:41.260]  united states a year before the spy masters had and uh because they had a whole global empire to
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:49.020]  run so i never sat on the british empire and it didn't today uh and um yeah if you're a prison
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:56.300]  planet dot tv viewer with the guys just found that well you guys saved that because years ago i found
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:02.700]  a copy of it in a book and then i had one of my guys spend a lot of money getting it from the
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:08.380]  archives and it took us about a week to figure out they changed the name uh and then once we
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:15.580]  found it it was sent to me a uh original copy cost a i think like 50 bucks i forget and then i lost
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:20.700]  it somewhere around the office but you found an online photo of it frame japanese may strike over
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:26.300]  weekend and see a little advertiser just like i said that's why the guys you know i can put an ad in
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:32.700]  craigslist and i don't tell people they're coming to work for alex shows because i don't want
[01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:37.580]  infiltrators it's a way to get infiltrators put an ad out uh and it's also a way to get fans
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:41.660]  and when they found out find out we actually work around here and that i don't levitate and float
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:48.220]  around uh you know then they get angry or they're not government infiltrators they're like nuts who
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:53.580]  want to be me and so they get a job here just try to screw up what's going on here and you know
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:57.740]  engage in operations turned out one of them was a cop we found out an informant years ago but we
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:03.100]  dealt with that so this is the type of bizarreness that goes on but side issue i don't know how i got
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:07.740]  off into that whole subject oh yeah i hire people and a lot of times they're like yeah i don't believe
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:12.700]  a word you say but i'll take on the job i'm like you're exactly who we want but when i'm talking
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:17.020]  about things you will randomly search engine them and then they search engine and everything i say
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:22.060]  is right there for them no matter how insane it is just all admitted you could also pull up but i
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:29.100]  can't remember the exact headline the san diego uh what is it herald tribune 64 article when the
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:33.100]  ships got back a few months later and they got off and said nobody attacked us we're told to shut
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:38.460]  up it's all staged that's how we know tonkin was staged and 40 something years later we now know
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:45.260]  but you can pull that one up wait wait wait let me pull up the exact headline out of my mind
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:57.100]  i can do it hold on it's a 1964 um article out of san diego i think it's herald tribune i think
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:03.180]  is the name of the paper and the exact headline is hold on just a minute i'm gonna try to remember
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:17.180]  this right now sailors say ships not attacked in tonkin gulf sailors say ships not attacked in
[01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:26.540]  tonkin gulf and then the article quotes them including senior officers as saying that they
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:33.020]  were told not to talk about it and that they believe it was a a staged event a i think they
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:40.380]  even use false flag as their navy guys see if you can get that the internet's incredible
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:46.620]  okay um side issue i'm already digressing but that's what i do going over the financial news
[01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:50.380]  dollar should be replaced as international standard human report says but don't worry
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:54.060]  you'll still have the year on the dollar but now these bankers will be able to
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:59.980]  even more currency manipulation driving it up driving it down so i'll have the best of both
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:03.980]  worlds they'll be able to manipulate currencies with insider trading to consolidate their power
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:09.260]  through fraud but only select mega groups they'll be able to buy up all their competition with that
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:14.300]  unfair advantage it's more than unfair advantage it's like straight jacketing the other football
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:21.100]  team and you know not letting and tying them down so they can't walk and then running touchdowns back
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:28.860]  and forth for two hours for four quarters claiming that you um you know beat them by 10 000 to zero
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:34.460]  i mean it's it's just it's just asinine and that's why all these these scum are so arrogant
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:39.260]  talking about how they're the master elite and we deserve to be slaves and i guess in a way we do
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:45.180]  if we let a bunch of frauds a bunch of kinlay made-off types just openly rob everything and
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:49.100]  i guess if the cops want to follow the orders and all the bureaucrats do and all the workers
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:51.900]  then i guess you're gonna get what you deserve go drink some fluoride on me

[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:56.380]  and abortions on blacks if you think killing black people's pro black then i got a bridge i want to
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:45:01.660]  sell you i mean you got to get mad you got to get angry you got to start seeing through just how
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:07.500]  crazy all this garbage is all right i'm getting angry i'm getting angry ladies and gentlemen i
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:14.140]  gotta settle down a little bit i've decided starting in the middle of july in just 12 days
[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:19.260]  i'm gonna make this announcement here now i'm going to three hours instead of four
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:23.580]  i've been doing four hours for two years and i've just i've got to build a new tv studio i want to
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:28.780]  do a tv report every day i've decided and it just drains me too much the fourth hour i need i need
[01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:34.220]  that energy to go into the tv show plus i can say it all in three hours like i did for 13 years
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:39.580]  before i switched over to four hours and we'll just re-air the first hour and the fourth hour so
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:43.100]  for stations already carrying the fourth hour don't worry it'll just be the first hour so those
[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:47.980]  adjustments will be made and the network sends my show out 24 hours down the satellite but
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:56.380]  there was a reason i got into that issue as well oh we're just going to start simulcasting the full
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:46:01.820]  three hours every day so there's none of it that's not covered on prisonplanet.tv and then
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:09.020]  archived starting july 12th we will be three hours a day and all three hours will be simulcast
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:15.740]  at prisonplanet.tv if the hair lips the admiral uh if the if the water doesn't rise over bear creek
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:21.260]  because what happens is i i tend to get in here and then rant in the first hour some of my best
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:28.380]  material and the most important info we cover and then i tend to overheat by the fourth hour and
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:35.740]  just start babbling and i'll do stuff like comb my hair straight back in the morning and and not
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:40.540]  even comb it so i almost just have don't air the first hour because i need to i forget to comb my
[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:45.340]  hair before i go on tv so i'll just start having to get ready before i go live getting here a little
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:48.940]  bit early because i'm the type of guy gets out of the shower comes my hair straight back brush my
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:53.740]  teeth shoot some deodorant on put my socks on put my clothes on it takes me about seven eight
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:58.940]  minutes to get showered dressed ready and i've got to start converting over more to the tv mode
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:04.460]  i may have to start going to the salon every day and having my hair done i'm that's a joke folks
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:11.100]  that's a joke i've come here to kick butt and chew bubblegum when i'm all out of bubblegum
[01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:18.860]  you got to have some comic relief my friends when everything is disintegrating like it is i mean
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:23.020]  look at these headlines dollars should be replaced as international standard human report says this
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:29.020]  is high treason and our government agrees geithner agrees obama agrees very satara agrees
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:34.620]  uh here's another one again like i've been covering this the last few days a whole bunch
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:39.020]  of mainstream news new york times wall street journal they all admit okay we're in a depression
[01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:45.900]  third depression fed officials avoid talk of further stimulus to stoke growth yeah because
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:50.380]  they've already got a stimulus package passed that means unlimited money in an open window
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:55.660]  where they can go there every week if they want and get 887 million dollars that's an open revolving
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:48:01.900]  door yeah that's why bloomberg reports it's uh you know 28 trillion dollars seven months ago
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:07.740]  we've never gotten new numbers since then it's gotta be something like 35 trillion now they've
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:13.820]  stolen domestically but we don't know and at a certain point 24 trillion 28 trillion 35 trillion
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:18.380]  it's like do you want me to shoot you and they had a hundred times or a thousand times at a
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:23.740]  certain point i mean it just it doesn't even matter the level of fraud these delicate little
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:27.660]  geniuses have created and i guess they are delicate geniuses i guess the goldman sacks
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:32.460]  harvard scum foreign intelligence operatives that run our country the corporate intelligence
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:36.940]  operatives that have fully turned our government over to themselves i guess they are better than
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:42.540]  us i guess we do deserve it i guess we are idiots well i'm not an idiot trash and just like the
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:46.940]  founding fathers i don't want to be your offshore slave there's always going to be another minority
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:50.700]  that doesn't want to be a parasite that wants to be left alone so okay you're a minority that's
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:56.380]  taking over all the mainline schmucks out there that want to suck their thumbs all day i'm not one
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:49:01.980]  of them you understand that and i am not your property i'm declaring it you've drawn first blood
[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:07.340]  in a thousand different ways get off my back parasite because you're gonna find out you're not
[01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:11.900]  the better man you're gonna find out like all bullies at the bigger you are the harder you're
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:15.820]  gonna fall and i think you recognize now the people are angry and there's no way for you
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:20.700]  you could spin this you little you little pieces of crap and you're gonna try to focus us in on
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:26.700]  rusekis and chai comms and oh yeah you know chai comms especially are a threat a threat you created
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:32.460]  and you're gonna try to focus us in on all these other enemies and little turban head brown people
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:37.340]  that you funded and created so we'll give up all our rights to you so you can rape us financially
[01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:43.820]  and physically but we know it's a corporate globalist treason takeover corporations are bigger
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:49.580]  than governments more powerful and that's what the new world order is and we are calling you out trash
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:55.740]  in fact on the subject of bp before i get back to the economy i'll get more into bp later

[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:16.060]  valero or something or some of the other companies that are out there most of them are owned by the
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:21.900]  parent mafia organization that's completely owned by big banks bp is just a front company on record
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:27.820]  basically british intelligence they use bp employees overthrow iran in 53 and that's on
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:37.100]  record operation ajax declassified 1999 but uh bp created obama with golden sacks it's one of the
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:44.220]  same golden sacks owns bp the biggest shareholder they created the carbon tax with ken lay and enron
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:52.380]  on record the mid 90s with al gore uh but but the fake republicans are acting like obama's

[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:19.500]  oil and the government's blocking the cleanup out in the gulf just waiting for the hurricanes to
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:25.100]  blow in the oil so they can have their crisis and the banking takeover of every financial

[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:07.020]  and tell you about a meeting i attended last night uh it turned out to be an organization mostly i
[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:14.780]  would say of neil connes called go this is not a promotion of their of their dot com but it stands
[02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:21.100]  for get out of our house which was basically another neil connes circle jerk as far as i was
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:29.340]  concerned um asking loaded questions about con connes um you know whether we should amend the
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:34.700]  constitution to exclude people with law degrees from serving in the house of representatives
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:39.660]  you know that's a red herring you can't do that i mean the problem is a con con once you open a
[02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:45.340]  constitutional convention up everything's on the table right and guaranteed the globalist
[02:02:45.340 --> 02:02:52.220]  would stage a terror attack and during the hysteria abolish everything a con con is deadly that's
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:03:00.460]  what i told him hey can i give a shout out to my son and just uh in wisconsin justin he's 20 29
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:08.300]  today and uh he woke up on his own half dozen years ago god bless him well good were you awake first

[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:36.540]  california ernie you're on the air hey hey alex hey uh i'm every time i go to the store i try to
[02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:40.780]  tell people about aspartame or ferrari and if they give me the dumb look then i tell them the third
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:47.500]  thing i inspire i instead i instead one thing two things are infinite space and stupidity and then
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:52.540]  i walk away from them but the other thing i want to talk about is the web buy i don't know if you're
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:58.940]  interested but it's talking about a possible 1.2 billion dead from gulf oil spill and also this
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:05.260]  has been in book of revelations uh the hopey prophecy uh the seven sign uh let me see egregate
[02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:10.300]  he wrote about it and a few other people including that shaman that's in africa with the name
[02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:17.980]  credo mutua or something like that basically i just think uh the eugenics program's already into
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:23.580]  effect big time with this oil spill and i want to get your take on that well i appreciate your
[02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:29.260]  call let me come back and give you my take on it but um i've known people we've interviewed
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:37.020]  activists who print up little cards with a couple of fluoride um websites that have facts on them
[02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:42.780]  fluoride's deadly and they put it in fluoride water you know containers for kids at the grocery store
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:48.380]  but now they don't just put aspartame and diet coke and Pepsi it's in tens of thousands of
[02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:53.180]  products it's in almost all the candy so you just go in the grocery store and stick those cards

[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:09.100]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:12.220]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:25.260]  when you read state department memorandum 200 by henry kissinger in 73 declassified in 93
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:33.020]  they talk about using wars and famine and if a african country or latin american country
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:38.060]  starts industrializing and becoming wealthy that they would finance rebels to overthrow the government
[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:41.820]  and that if countries wanted their imf and world bank loans they would have to cut their
[02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:48.060]  population growth by 50 percent that's just one of many documents but that's one that's well known
[02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:56.140]  you can look up and read the whole text of now people are saying well this golf thing is the
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:09:00.300]  beginning of the eugenics and that the oil is going to kill everybody basically
[02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:07.340]  all the eugenics and the soft kill that we've seen again soft kill something that kills you
[02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:11.820]  20 years later so you don't know what killed you you don't know what caused the disease
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:19.100]  you don't understand the underlying chemical or biological uh precursors or or or binary systems
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:24.460]  that mix together to create that degenerative disease but the establishment scientists tested
[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:31.340]  on guinea pigs rats pigs and it's almost 100 what affects them will affect us the exact same way
[02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:36.780]  pigs guinea pigs mice rabbits are similar that's why they use them as lab animals and so they've
[02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:42.700]  they figured all this out exactly how to soft kill us but humans are very resilient very strong
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:48.620]  we're omnivores we're designed to be able to take on a lot of poisons we're long lived we're tough
[02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:54.780]  we're tough as nails okay and we're a lot tougher than a rat and rats are tough
[02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:04.460]  pigs are tough and that's just what we're closest to genetically not in our dna but but in the way
[02:10:04.460 --> 02:10:13.100]  our bodies deal with chemicals and toxins is porcine pigs um and rodents but side issue
[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:20.300]  the gulf is the primary ignition device to get the carbon taxes passed that they openly admit even
[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:31.020]  in cnn is to fund the global s dr which is this new un imf world bank bank issued cashless money
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:35.500]  where they just create tens of trillions and then and then your government has to
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:41.260]  to denominate their currencies in that that is your your your currency is pegged to that
[02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:47.020]  and controlled by that and then you pay taxes to the bankers to give value to the currency
[02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:53.820]  that it's a debt system where they create more currency and more credit and more debt
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:59.420]  than there is uh you know actual physical money or jobs to pay it back where it's mathematically
[02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:06.700]  impossible to ever get ahead and so it's designed to render you down to slaves so they've totally
[02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:10.860]  enslaved us now with the domestic operation they've done it to every country they control
[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:17.980]  almost every nation they're mopping up the few they don't russia north korea uh iran libya
[02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:23.340]  somalia whether those countries are good or bad the point is they're being taken over by the board
[02:11:23.340 --> 02:11:32.060]  they're the last to fall and now they need the gulf disaster for to go on for six months a
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:36.460]  year they're saying it may go on for two years and they needed to not let the big ships that can
[02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:40.860]  scoop all the oil up scoop it up because then the hurricanes can't blow in and drive it into the
[02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:46.140]  estuaries and cause a real crisis and some evacuations to set the president uh the president
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:50.940]  can grandstand as our savior and they can uh then say see we've got to have carbon taxes
[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:56.300]  oils bad we've got to seize the economy tell you what type of car you can drive what type of industry
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:12:03.100]  uh here's an article today give me a close shot please gentlemen uh from the london telegraph
[02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:09.260]  and it says prices rise as new zealand passes emissions trading scheme petrol and power prices
[02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:13.180]  have risen sharply in new zealand after the government introduced a controversial emissions
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:22.460]  trading scheme and they've gone up massively it says now understand ladies and gentlemen that the
[02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:27.660]  day they passed it the next week it went up three to five percent in its forecast to go up as much
[02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:34.540]  as 20 percent now we have the newscast where they're not saying it's bad they're national news in
[02:12:34.540 --> 02:12:41.020]  australia saying half the land in australia is now off limits uh by not letting farmers farm on
[02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:46.140]  half their land nationwide and not letting new land be developed uh this cuts our carbon credit
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:50.620]  and australia gets five billion dollars or whatever uh and it just shows people going it's over i'm
[02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:54.700]  bankrupt and the government's there going don't worry we have a program to buy your land at five
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:13:02.860]  cents on the dollar i mean this is mafia takeover like the mafia just lands in say east texas and
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:09.980]  says hey you can't farm no more and you gotta pay taxes to me now it's for the earth oh you
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:25.420]  don't like it there was an oil spill oh god help us but the caller was raising that point
[02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:29.340]  and so i thought i would just mention the eugenics is going on all around you they've
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:36.220]  been testing soft kill binary weapons degenerative weapons it reduces our life expectancy and people
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:41.340]  live past 80 on average a hundred years ago and before if they made it past the age of about eight
[02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:46.540]  or nine or ten depending on the period because you had a high infant mortality babies died a lot
[02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:50.620]  women died in childbirth you take those statistics out we're living on average about eight years
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:54.700]  less than we were and it'd be even less than that they kill you with the soft kill weapons they weaken
[02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:58.860]  you and then they have all these expensive treatments that the drug companies and others
[02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:05.340]  suck all the money out of you at the end of your life with so it's all set up you it's estimated
[02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:10.860]  people lived about 61 men 61 women 65 is the number i saw last week by the american medical
[02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:16.140]  association if they didn't have all this medicine and all these surgeries and all this drugs so they
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:21.500]  keep you alive like darth vader they make you sick then give you darth vader prosthesis to keep you
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:27.100]  alive and then suck all your wealth that you've made over your life into their coffers it's all
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:31.100]  scientifically designed and the doctors are compartmentalized and don't see it a lot of them
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:35.740]  are starting to though like dr. blalock and others the more prestigious the more they understand it
[02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:39.900]  that's why they're prestigious because they can think in a multi-faceted multi-variate
[02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:47.500]  three-dimensional tie-in system through historical scientific um anthropological integration
[02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:51.180]  let's go ahead and talk to uh matt in new york you're on the air matt
[02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:57.500]  alex great to talk to you great to talk to you um i had a couple of quick things for you i don't
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:15:01.900]  know if you'd get a chance to listen to the financial sense news hour but uh for the past
[02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:07.740]  couple of weeks people have been calling in and nominating you to uh debate matt simmonds on p boil
[02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:11.580]  and uh that's something they talk about there frequently and uh i hope they get in touch with
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:15.980]  you and i hope you take them up on i hope they're able to i was told opien anthony tried to get
[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:20.540]  all of us for a week and i've got actually good guys in there now trying to go through all the
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:28.060]  we get 5000 emails a day 400 500 phone calls uh and we're trying to sort through it all it'd be
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:33.580]  nice if certain people didn't call the office 30 40 50 times a day we probably got 100 people that
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:39.660]  literally call sometimes 50 times a day so we're sorting through all that insanity uh but yes um
[02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:43.980]  what's the media request email so i can just give that out specifically
[02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:54.380]  yeah we'll get that for you we're so on top of something else uh i i wanted to bring up was
[02:15:54.380 --> 02:15:57.980]  with this oil still going on as long as it has how come i haven't heard anything about the law of
[02:15:57.980 --> 02:16:03.820]  the sea treaty it sounds like that that would be uh exactly where this is going well actually that
[02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:08.300]  they've been trying to ratify the law of the sea treaty and this international gun grab treaty
[02:16:08.300 --> 02:16:13.100]  to where you pay a tax worldwide to travel on the ocean and even our inland waterways will
[02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:19.100]  be under un uh control just like a naft and gat we've given up our trade control or through nato
[02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:24.860]  given up lots of our military control uh or through these other systems to corporate bodies
[02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:30.620]  but that's another great point you raise they are proposing the carbon tax which is an international
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:35.420]  treaty which does actually tie into the law of the sea i mean what does the law of the sea
[02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:41.340]  and what does a carbon tax have to do with stopping the leak nothing but that's what
[02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:46.620]  obama has proposed and he's blocked foreign ships that could scoop the oil up until it's too late
[02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:51.420]  and all that oil comes ashore but great points anything else you always bring the uh the the
[02:16:51.420 --> 02:16:57.420]  treaty up first and then the crisis comes later and now we see the crisis um one other thing i
[02:16:57.420 --> 02:17:02.620]  also wanted to say was i think it was two years ago that uh right after bill deberg uh john edwards
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:08.220]  got burned in the media you know his relationship got outed and right now as soon as bill deberg
[02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:11.500]  let out i see al gore is in the same spot i wonder if you have any thoughts on that
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:22.300]  continue uh no that's all i got for you all right i appreciate your call good to hear from you
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:29.180]  let's talk to scott in washington scott you're on the air yeah alex there's several points and this
[02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:35.260]  has been pissing me off all week that i'd like to bring up about the former now departed late
[02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:42.860]  grand dragon kkk member robert bird to begin with and especially to address that caller that left
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:49.580]  that message on your board you know so-called mr constitution you know you may want to remind
[02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:55.100]  him that number one this is the same guy that also voted for the patriot act number one oh i
[02:17:55.100 --> 02:18:01.740]  forgot about that yeah he did that's number one so this so-called patriot stuff and as
[02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:07.660]  as far as him talking about the n double a cp listen black people have been calling them out for
[02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:13.740]  the latter part of the 20th century for being the race pimping and poverty pimping organization
[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:20.780]  that they are so that means absolutely nothing i will tell you myself i as the black man especially
[02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:27.580]  am offended by the way these phony two-faced white liberals are sitting around here crying over this
[02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:33.980]  guy this is the same guy now they have a nerve to sit there and lambast ran paul because of one
[02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:41.180]  point of the civil rights act that he might have objected to this is the same guy that filibustered
[02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:50.300]  it and not only that was not only just a member of the kkk but a grand cyclops a recruiter impossible
[02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:55.420]  murderer in the kkk well he also said that he didn't want blacks to be in the military
[02:18:55.420 --> 02:19:01.820]  next to white people exactly and you know what happened and when i say possible murderer as
[02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:06.860]  far as lynchings in the kkk you know you remember when that thing happened with strong thermon
[02:19:06.860 --> 02:19:12.460]  that whole debacle with trendlock that the comet that he made yes after his hundredth birthday
[02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:17.660]  and there were a bunch of black republican um activists that actually protested robert
[02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:23.580]  bird and brought up his kkk days and uh one of the buildings that they said and i don't remember
[02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:30.700]  which one it was but uh robert bird had sent a staffer down there and this was reported to
[02:19:30.700 --> 02:19:35.660]  newsmax and this was around 2003 and stay there i want to hear about this when we come back come
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:39.740]  back and tell us about it i don't want to get into a robert bird bashing fest i mean he's dead
[02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:45.340]  90-something years old the father of port barrel he voted for the patriot act and i'm supposed to
[02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:51.260]  worship him because the media told west virginians he represented them uh you know my issue is
[02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:58.860]  that i'm against robert bird uh because he's a globalist and he's dead now so it's a non-issue
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:05.500]  but we'll let you finish up on the other side global meltdowns massive unemployment endless wars

[02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:56.940]  dragons cyclopses it was the founder of the clan who was also a confederate general
[02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:03.180]  who was the head of the illuminati albert pike this is on record
[02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:09.580]  who talked about how there'd be three world wars the first with the germans the second
[02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:15.900]  with the germans the third starting in the middle east this is on record now i'm not saying i was
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:19.500]  against the south the civil war that was a different thing entirely british intelligence
[02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:24.380]  came in and manipulated the south into the war this is on record and manipulated the north into the
[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:30.780]  war then they put british troops in canada and toronto and threatened to invade so it's not this
[02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:36.220]  side's good that side's good or this side's good that side's bad it's all sides you need to analyze
[02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:39.900]  thing and not think of it as black and white when you're looking at other globalists are manipulating
[02:25:39.900 --> 02:25:45.660]  grips but i don't want to get off into these discussions uh it's just that robert bird did
[02:25:45.660 --> 02:25:50.220]  vote for the patriot act a lot of other bad stuff he voted for some good stuff and i think as he got
[02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:58.620]  older you know he got better uh but uh you know he presided for 60 years over the senate while
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:03.740]  america went to hell in a handbasket and so i did get a threatening phone call saying you better
[02:26:03.740 --> 02:26:09.820]  not come to west virginia talking about uh our beloved bird man uh but i don't like speaking
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:16.380]  at all the dead uh so i'm i'm i'm done talking about it but i don't sense your calls uh so um
[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:22.220]  you know the caller who are we talking to that's right scott in washington scott finish your point
[02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:28.060]  we're talking about a newsmax article about the bird man well one of the questions that was
[02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:33.660]  asked to him about his activities in the clan day and one of them that was asked that whether or
[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:40.300]  not he participated in any lynchings back then and that was the only question that was answered
[02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:46.460]  the rest of them is that press secretary said that they never discussed it but this particular one
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:54.300]  was asked and uh apparently bird told this press aid to tell the protesters is that he didn't
[02:26:54.300 --> 02:27:01.420]  recall whether or not he had actually participated in any lynchings now it seems to me that if you
[02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:07.580]  didn't do any of the things that you were accused of you would come right out and say no i didn't
[02:27:07.580 --> 02:27:14.220]  and it was well known and it was well known that in between the late 1880s and up until
[02:27:14.220 --> 02:27:21.980]  the mid-1960s that there were over four thousand lynchings mostly black black now are you saying
[02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:29.180]  that a grand cyclopsian supreme dragon in one of the most oppressive states at the time
[02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:34.300]  covered with clan where there were lynchings all over might have been involved that's ridiculous
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:39.900]  that's like saying water might be wet don't talk about about the cyclops the cyclopsian ruler
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:47.260]  well that's what was quoted in there that that he doesn't recall that's the vague language that was
[02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:53.260]  used so you know that's when i say and i don't know for certain whether it's true but that's why i
[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:59.340]  say possible so you know i don't like talking ill of the dead either and i don't really like getting
[02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:05.500]  off into this stuff but you know as far as i'm concerned it's no great loss and you know i hope
[02:28:05.500 --> 02:28:10.860]  he's burning in hell but that's so you're not you're not crying yourself to sleep at night right
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:18.700]  now over a bird well no okay i appreciate your call scott let me just say this look the russians
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:22.860]  have infiltrated the united states of course they're trying to infiltrate computer companies
[02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:27.980]  and brokerage houses in harvard because that's the corporate group that has hijacked our country
[02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:32.220]  they're allowed to steal trillions of dollars in plain view and get in no trouble almost every
[02:28:32.220 --> 02:28:38.140]  person in the obama ministrations from harvard it's a sickening little crew of crux and i'm not
[02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:42.140]  saying you're bad if you have a harvard degree it is a great university it's that in the political
[02:28:42.140 --> 02:28:47.580]  science area and the law school it's it's it's a bunch of crux i mean it's on record i've had
[02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:53.580]  top phd's from harvard on who were taught how to overthrow america it's it's a corporate takeover
[02:28:54.140 --> 02:28:59.180]  you know what's it have to do with bird it's the same thing look the clan is almost non-existent
[02:28:59.180 --> 02:29:05.580]  in this country back when they had birth of the nation you know the machete of its time it was
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:10.780]  the popular la raza for white people and it was popular and the corporate media promoted it because
[02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:18.940]  there were millions and millions of members but now it's a diversion and a distraction and bird
[02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:25.100]  as corrupt as he was was in opposition to a lot of what was going on because things are so much
[02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:31.260]  more corrupt now they've passed surpassed anything he ever did so it's kind of like am i worried about
[02:29:31.260 --> 02:29:40.060]  11 russian sex operatives or whatever um compared to global banks that have engaged in espionage
[02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:45.740]  it's called globalism who have bought off treacherous treasonous americans who've taken over our
[02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:50.540]  government and are robbing us and raising taxes to pay to themselves that's what i'm focused on

[02:32:58.860 --> 02:33:14.780]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:33.820]  i don't like al gore he's always like a big fat rapist to me looks like a giant pervert but i
[02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:40.700]  don't go off my instincts though they're always right i'm gotta trust but verify and i've listened
[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:45.900]  to the woman's testimony we played parts of it it's up on info wars and dot com prison planet
[02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:51.500]  dot com since last weekend and it's her audio police report it's actually hours long we we put
[02:33:51.500 --> 02:34:00.700]  up a version that kind of boils it down to 23 minutes but al gore came in she he was staying
[02:34:00.700 --> 02:34:06.380]  in a fancy hotel he showed her condoms and said i'm going to use these he began grabbing her hands
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:11.340]  and putting them on his genitals she said she wasn't that type of masseuse that it wasn't she
[02:34:11.340 --> 02:34:18.300]  wasn't a prostitute and that he seemed to be confused about what he'd ordered and uh she
[02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:22.460]  explained it all to him and then of course he started trying to get her stuff and leave and
[02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:29.900]  he was running up behind her in the bathrobe hunching on her without underwear on and and doing
[02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:35.340]  classic politician stuff of like i'm not advancing on you when you don't want me to that's preposterous
[02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:39.740]  as he was hunching on her uh so i mean that's classic this is not an assault like it wake
[02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:44.060]  up as they're ramming the building pumping gas in or we're not setting up a world government
[02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:50.140]  next on cnn world government the only hope will pay our taxes to them i'm not having
[02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:56.780]  unwanted sexual advances as he was chasing her around with an erection protruding from his bathrobe
[02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:02.780]  according to her and it sounds very credible and it's very credible that she didn't go
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:08.700]  file the report for a few months because she was so freaked out i mean i had a juvenile
[02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:13.260]  justice guard try to rape me in a shower and i threatened him off of me but i didn't talk
[02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:17.500]  about that for years i'd probably been on talk radio for a decade before i'd talk about it because
[02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:22.380]  it just sounds embarrassing but now i can care less i just talk about everything uh but i mean
[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:30.780]  you know imagine a woman al gore who just won the peace prize he's like god abc news portland police
[02:35:30.780 --> 02:35:37.820]  reopen al gore sex abuse case and she says she's got the blue stained dress oh al got a little too
[02:35:37.820 --> 02:35:44.460]  excited and we're not going to play you know he well you've well you've saw everybody's if they've
[02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:49.100]  got a dog who hadn't castrated you've seen it kind of get excited on the grass and scooting
[02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:56.620]  it's hindering that kind of what al gore did i mean reportedly so so we'll see about this dna
[02:35:56.620 --> 02:36:01.100]  testing i shouldn't be laughing i mean it's a very serious matter to have a vice president involved
[02:36:01.100 --> 02:36:07.340]  in this it's just it's so gross and al gore the man bear pig is so embarrassing and so degenerate
[02:36:08.220 --> 02:36:12.860]  and this will discredit their global carbon tax i mean they've got their oil spill to push their
[02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:18.540]  carbon tax and they're blocking the aid ships that could have skimmed all this up because they
[02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:25.180]  want the hurricanes to bring the oil and use the crisis to get their carbon tax and al gore of course
[02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:30.700]  is one of the main investors in it but this is as big as the oil spill you know they want to use
[02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:35.900]  some unrelated oil spill for taxes this is going to put an even bigger nail in anthropogenic global
[02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:40.460]  warming but see that there's a reason they're now reopening the investigation again it's because
[02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:45.900]  he's not the Nobel Prize winner anymore in the court of public opinion he's a fraud he's lost all
[02:36:45.900 --> 02:36:53.100]  credibility people know he's a joke they remember bill clinton uh saying i did not have sex with that
[02:36:53.100 --> 02:36:57.420]  woman monica lawinsky they remember all the women that came out who said that bill clinton would
[02:36:57.420 --> 02:37:01.980]  corner him rape him that he liked to bite them he would bite them bite their face to hold them
[02:37:01.980 --> 02:37:08.300]  down while he raped them uh and people remember the interviews of the landlord of one lady of
[02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:13.660]  jennifer flowers the state police came and broke his legs and almost killed him uh all because
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:20.060]  he'd videotape bill clinton going in to have a little fun with his jelly and everybody remembers
[02:37:20.060 --> 02:37:24.060]  all those rape allegations and the groping allegations and that clinton got caught lying
[02:37:24.060 --> 02:37:28.940]  about it and that he was groping and grabbing women and it seemed like the uglier the more
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:33.500]  and that's actually something with the elite they like down syndrome children and they like
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:38.940]  women who aren't that attractive i mean i wouldn't say this woman's that attractive uh and it seems
[02:37:38.940 --> 02:37:46.860]  to be the forcing it on them uh some of the harbert frat guys invented what they call wailing
[02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:51.980]  i'm i'm not going to go any deeper into it but the fatter the woman the better and they like
[02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:55.580]  to get them drunk and then be mean to them i've actually heard the story from some of the scum
[02:37:56.700 --> 02:38:01.020]  so again this is what these elites are into if they can have any gorgeous beautiful number 10
[02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:06.140]  woman they want now they like to kind of make an old lady beg and plead and not want to have sex
[02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:10.780]  with them so again it just it just fits the whole mo and i believe it happened and he's in a lot of
[02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:15.740]  trouble of course his wife's leaving him ahead of all this coming out and if you think tiger
[02:38:15.740 --> 02:38:22.060]  woods was out of control um he was just red-blooded i'm not saying it's good what he did but he did
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:28.380]  like attractive fast women there are worse crimes but uh rape or attempted rape is a crime portland
[02:38:28.380 --> 02:38:35.340]  police reopen al gore sex abuse allegations and uh claimed former vice president subjected her to
[02:38:35.340 --> 02:38:41.420]  unwanted sexual touching in 2006 i love the way the media spends that if you listen to this tape
[02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:45.820]  if you listen to her police report you can hear the police they're totally buying it they totally
[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:49.180]  know she's telling the truth because i mean that's what they're trained to be able to pick up on
[02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:54.380]  in fact let's just go ahead and play a few minutes of this tape right now uh i'm only gonna play a
[02:38:54.380 --> 02:38:59.180]  few minutes of it but let's go ahead and play a few minutes of it again portland police reopen
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:14.140]  al gore sex abuse tape uh and the chinese national television uh has uh also and of course we also
[02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:21.980]  have the uh inquire cover al gore is a pervert and sexual predator and she told him stop it you
[02:39:21.980 --> 02:39:27.660]  sex poodle as you know she said she tried to nicely get him to stop but he just kept pushing and
[02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:33.020]  pushing and it appeared that's how he liked it so she had to escape out of the room but again
[02:39:33.020 --> 02:39:38.060]  the reason i know her story is true there's a lot of factors was the you know repeating this is not
[02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:43.420]  unwanted sexual events i am not making it this is not happening as he was chasing her around
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:50.300]  trying to grab her from behind hunching like a feral dog uh you know does with a chew toy
[02:39:51.580 --> 02:39:56.780]  let's go ahead and go to this tape here it is i went into much deeper shock as i realized it appeared
[02:39:56.780 --> 02:40:04.700]  he was demanding sexual favors or sexual behaviors i decided to claire i got so freaked i just thought
[02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:12.460]  i got tiny bit mad under my terror i decided to clarify things by asking him as he angrily
[02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:18.620]  complained that i was not doing what he wanted for him to show me exactly what he wanted me to do
[02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:23.340]  such as where i'm such i said well why don't you show me because i thought this is too not
[02:40:23.340 --> 02:40:32.220]  not he grabbed my right hand hard shoved it down under the sheet to his pubic hair area
[02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:37.820]  my fingers brushing against his penis and firmly planted my hand on his pubic crest region and
[02:40:39.100 --> 02:40:45.980]  said to me there in a very sharp loud angry sounding tone this is all happening really fast as you
[02:40:45.980 --> 02:40:50.940]  can imagine further yet into shock from both his demand and his angry intimidating behavior
[02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:56.780]  i subtly and slowly slid my hand up away from the area and told him it would be counterproductive
[02:40:56.780 --> 02:41:02.860]  massage technique as he had said that he'd wanted to unwind from stress and relax and that it would
[02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:08.060]  get him to awake i said euphemistically and diplomatically i thought i was dancing on the
[02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:15.500]  edge of a razor he angrily raged an accusatory and threatening confrontational tone he bellowed at me
[02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:22.220]  i have no idea and i i've never had a fight yell at me except for one who's brain injured
[02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:28.860]  too strong and i've worked with her all the time she's a mess but she's like five feet tall and
[02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:38.140]  she'll cry okay so he he screamed at me he goes i'm not asking imagine yelling i'm not asking for
[02:41:38.140 --> 02:41:43.820]  you to do anything inappropriate to which i replied in a soft or terrified calming tone
[02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:50.940]  no impropriety was inferred sir at this point i was realizing just how crazy in cities he was
[02:41:50.940 --> 02:41:55.580]  and how precarious when situation was when he said the aforementioned even though he clearly
[02:41:55.580 --> 02:42:02.460]  wanted inappropriate touch it's like to make your mind go nuts he was moaning groaning moving and
[02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:08.780]  acting in a very suggestive way it was unreal i never even had any of my hotel clients get
[02:42:08.780 --> 02:42:14.460]  angry yell or act out at me before during the massage episode i realized much to my horror
[02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:19.260]  that i was in the perfect storm and that i was in a room with someone who was tough on coded
[02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:26.540]  in terms of his credibility and celebrity status and my usual safety net idea in all hotel massages
[02:42:26.540 --> 02:42:31.580]  before this of being able to escape from such a potential situation perverted a threatened
[02:42:31.580 --> 02:42:35.820]  behavior from a client which would be terminating massage and leaving the room immediately for
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:42.140]  help from the front hotel desk even running and or shouting for help in the hallway if
[02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:47.740]  deemed necessary was completely worthless in this situation it was no longer viable
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:55.020]  because i feared that if i ran for the door to get out i could or would be violently costed by
[02:42:55.020 --> 02:43:00.460]  some security detail for seeming to be hostile inappropriate insubordinate or threatening
[02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:07.740]  to him and i fear being tased or shot by them as a first and immediate response i also feared
[02:43:07.740 --> 02:43:12.300]  that by made descent with gore i could be in danger of being falsely arrested for false
[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:18.620]  allegations of alleged soliciting or even attempted assault in his efforts to do damage control and
[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:24.700]  i felt certain that any even smallest complaint from him to the hotel could also destroy my work
[02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:31.100]  like reputation in all the hotels and hence do irreparable damage to my livelihood not to mention
[02:43:31.100 --> 02:43:37.340]  damage my personal reputation which i had spent years building with my livelihood i felt very
[02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:42.140]  uncertain if i'd be able to get out of the room without being accosted by him anyway at this point
[02:43:43.740 --> 02:43:50.300]  so it makes sense to y'all he then tried another tactic as though he had very suddenly switched
[02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:56.540]  personalities and began in a pleading tone pleading for release of his second chakra there
[02:43:56.540 --> 02:44:02.060]  there's so much tension being held this was yet another euphemism for sexual activity he was
[02:44:02.060 --> 02:44:07.100]  requesting but cleverly as though it were a spiritual request or something i was further
[02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:12.780]  deeply shocked and repulsed as my realization of what was happening sunk in and especially as my
[02:44:12.780 --> 02:44:19.180]  mind was now reeling from this absolute betrayal by someone i had inherently trusted as a good guy
[02:44:19.180 --> 02:44:26.140]  who cares about people including me because it was public persona no when i came out he was in
[02:44:26.140 --> 02:44:31.980]  his robe and he complimented me on the session i felt i could leave without further problems from
[02:44:31.980 --> 02:44:37.820]  him but i was wrong in that surmising i was freaked out and trying to act calm and collected so as
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:44.060]  not to look vulnerable and so as to keep any other weirdness from him from happening he engaged me
[02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:48.780]  in small talk as i head for my massage table to break it down and he came over to where i was
[02:44:51.420 --> 02:44:57.900]  while i was trying to pack up and then he wrapped me in an inescapable embrace as i turned around
[02:44:59.100 --> 02:45:04.620]  doing this come hither look deep into my eyes and caress my back and bikes and breasts i squirmed
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:10.060]  to try and get out of his grasp telling him to stop down several times and i finally told him
[02:45:10.060 --> 02:45:15.340]  that you're being a crazed sex poodle hoping that he'd realize how weird he was being yet he
[02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:22.460]  persisted he was much stronger than me bigger than me and insistent it was completely unnerving
[02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:29.180]  and i realized that resistance was making him giggle and pursue more strongly and i knew then
[02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:35.260]  that this resistance was a dangerous tactic to use if i wanted to avoid being raped i had the
[02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:39.820]  fear that rape would be inevitable if i could not get out of the room yet i could see no way to
[02:45:39.820 --> 02:45:45.900]  immediately leave without it also being a risk to my safety okay because i felt he would use force
[02:45:45.900 --> 02:45:52.220]  to counter it goes on forever but we've got the full multi hour interview we've got a 23 minute
[02:45:52.220 --> 02:45:58.380]  boil down you can go hear this for yourself as he begins chasing her around with an erection
[02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:03.180]  we don't normally talk about stuff like this on the show but we've got cops reportedly raping women
[02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:10.860]  up at the g20 we've got the vice president the former vice president reportedly doing this and
[02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:16.060]  it fits his mo to a t you've got a new police investigation so we have to play part of it
[02:46:16.060 --> 02:46:21.500]  it gets too graphic i've made the decision not to play anymore of the video because
[02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:28.140]  he starts running around with an erection outside of his robe humping on her as she goes out the
[02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:33.980]  door showing her condoms saying why are there condoms in this hotel room this is a hotel room
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:40.380]  that supplies me this and i was on a road trip once and i remember we were like in nevada
[02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:46.220]  somewhere in the middle of nowhere on a college road trip and we were sitting around joking in
[02:46:46.220 --> 02:46:52.780]  the room drinking beer and smoking cigarettes and we're like why does it say push here for massage
[02:46:52.780 --> 02:46:57.100]  and one of the guys jokes and goes this is nevada they probably send a hoardier room and later i
[02:46:57.100 --> 02:47:02.700]  found out that's what that is and so i think al gore must check into these super ritzy places
[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:08.700]  and thought he was conk because later in the tape he goes this is oriental massage and i
[02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:15.900]  you know in downtown austin they get places like midnight cowboy or and you oriental massage
[02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:23.340]  and or now they're called lingerie modeling and i've never been in one but the word is uh you get a
[02:47:23.340 --> 02:47:31.980]  little well actually i probably get four or five massages a year and a couple times and i didn't
[02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:37.020]  know what it meant women giving me massages they don't like a man touching me they would ask have
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:42.780]  you ever heard of a happy ending and uh i was like no and one one time the lady just laughed
[02:47:42.780 --> 02:47:48.140]  in the next time she she described it and it was like a hint do you want a happy ending buddy
[02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:56.060]  and i'm sorry i am uh not into prostitutes number one i'm married and and like my wife love my
[02:47:56.060 --> 02:48:04.700]  wife but there's just something like i'm not licking toilet bowls i'm not licking uh oh what do you
[02:48:04.700 --> 02:48:13.980]  call it uh doorknobs and i'm not even looking down on those women or saying they're bad i'm just scared
[02:48:15.500 --> 02:48:23.180]  i'm you know i'm but side issue that if you put all the pieces together it's very very very very
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:32.060]  clear that al gore thought he was ordering a oriental massage as the code word uh is and that she
[02:48:32.060 --> 02:48:38.220]  showed up and he was like look did get to work woman i've had a long day i'm very stressed
[02:48:39.100 --> 02:48:43.980]  but the minute she said no i mean this was then sexual assault
[02:48:46.540 --> 02:48:53.100]  and he molested this lady and i believe it and look inquire people confuse inquire of news of
[02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:58.380]  the world you'll have the inquirer and it'll say government plans to microchip population
[02:48:58.380 --> 02:49:02.300]  and they'll have a real article that i've that i've already seen in the ap a year before they'll
[02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:06.780]  just give it a more shocking headline and pretty much everything in the inquire i mean i remember
[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:12.700]  reading in the inquire when i was a little kid it was like laying in a haircut in place i mean i
[02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:16.140]  don't remember it was somewhere laying around in a business while i was waiting and it said
[02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:21.420]  schwarzenegger's dad was a nazi and schwarzenegger dressed as a nazi and gave out records of hitler
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:26.060]  when he lived in california and which screamed down with the blacks at the weightlifting gym
[02:49:26.060 --> 02:49:31.420]  and said he wanted to be a dictator and all this stuff and i thought oh this is the inquirer when
[02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:36.860]  i was like 13 years old reading that and then later it all came out in mainstream news and it
[02:49:36.860 --> 02:49:40.780]  turned out it was true it's kind of like john edwards it was the inquirer that broke all that
[02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:45.980]  she'll have the inquirer that i think is a pretty good investigative journal they do give it tabloid
[02:49:45.980 --> 02:49:53.500]  type sensational headlines but this is sensational but next to it'll have bat boy lands on white house
[02:49:53.500 --> 02:50:01.580]  lawn or president meets with aliens and even those publications that are 90 bull then they'll mix
[02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:06.540]  real news into discredited i think but i think uh in the national inquirer is a completely different
[02:50:06.540 --> 02:50:17.260]  animal i mean you know here it is al gore is a sexual pervert and predator so that is now in
[02:50:17.260 --> 02:50:23.100]  the news all right i'm gonna come back go to frank brian lauren jim brian and others on the other

[02:56:30.540 --> 02:56:34.780]  let's go to frank in north carolina frank you're on the air thanks for holding yeah thanks for
[02:56:34.780 --> 02:56:39.900]  taking my call i actually got a uh reformed imperial stormtrooper on the phone here well
[02:56:39.900 --> 02:56:46.780]  good to have you join the rebellion go ahead yeah i'm in corrupt north carolina here uh i was just
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:53.900]  thinking uh about with regards to al gore um perhaps the elites have decided to sacrifice them to
[02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:59.740]  molok maybe they've given the green light light on that because you know their little uh plan
[02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:04.220]  their little agenda didn't go so well with the cap and trade well let me stop you and i'll hold
[02:57:04.220 --> 02:57:09.820]  you over because i want to be able to finish your point but great minds think alike uh and
[02:57:10.780 --> 02:57:16.220]  i remember lord mongton not in this interview but in the last interview saying he believes they
[02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:20.860]  will throw people under the bus i said how do you think they're gonna counter us and he and others
[02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:26.300]  said well normally they'll they'll have a sacrifice they will destroy someone he said i don't think
[02:57:26.300 --> 02:57:30.620]  it'll just stop with professor jones one of the ring leaders of the university fraud it may
[02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:36.060]  you know expand from there to even al gore and then jaren during the break right before i went to
[02:57:36.060 --> 02:57:40.940]  you said alex don't you think they're throwing him under the bus use the same term you used
[02:57:40.940 --> 02:57:46.380]  aren't they throwing him under the bus uh and they'll get a new puppet for cap and trade uh and i
[02:57:46.380 --> 02:57:51.580]  said yeah i'm gonna make that point when i go live then i go to you and you say the same thing frank
[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:56.940]  so yes i think i mean they knew about this the whole time but also he's now been discredited
[02:57:56.940 --> 02:58:02.300]  and so i think the police were scared to go after him to begin with and i think the system now
[02:58:02.300 --> 02:58:09.020]  may let him be destroyed because it's a convenient distraction uh but uh i'm sorry he just looks like
[02:58:09.020 --> 02:58:12.700]  a rapist and i don't normally go off of somebody looks but he always looks i mean he looks like
[02:58:12.700 --> 02:58:17.980]  a pervert to me but you can't you can't go off that this woman says she has dna from him hunching
[02:58:17.980 --> 02:58:23.100]  on her that he ejaculated on her uh she says she's got witnesses as well stay there we'll come back
[02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:28.300]  to you one minute break we'll get uh frank who says he's a retired or or reform strong trip or
[02:58:28.300 --> 02:58:34.060]  maybe current or former police officer then we'll go to brian loren jim and brian but again you're

[02:59:59.100 --> 03:00:07.980]  it's
[03:00:10.620 --> 03:00:18.540]  al gore is a pervert and sexual predator abc news headline portland police reopen al gore sex
[03:00:18.540 --> 03:00:24.140]  abuse allegations look i don't think the police want to bust al gore because they know they'll be
[03:00:24.140 --> 03:00:29.180]  punished they'll be persecuted later but because this has come out his wife's leaving him he's
[03:00:29.180 --> 03:00:34.220]  been exposed as a fraud for climate gain set to make billions of dollars off this fraud himself
[03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:41.660]  individually this is coming back to the fore now uh because al gore is seen as weaker but the police
[03:00:41.660 --> 03:00:46.060]  really wanted to burn him they'd be having press conferences they'd be saying they thought he was
[03:00:46.060 --> 03:00:52.220]  guilty uh who knows what's really going on here but this fits al gore and i don't think this woman
[03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:57.820]  sophisticated enough to actually know what an al gore would say i mean the way she describes him
[03:00:57.820 --> 03:01:02.860]  as he's trying to you know grab her and hump on her for lack of a better word you know hunching on
[03:01:02.860 --> 03:01:08.700]  her i'm not doing an unwanted this is not happening i'm angry with you saying i'm doing this that
[03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:15.100]  that is exactly what these guys do that is exactly what they're all about they assault you and deny
[03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:22.460]  they're doing it but go ahead and make your point sir uh yes um yeah as far as the reformed imperial
[03:01:22.460 --> 03:01:29.660]  stormtrooper thing uh i was referring to my days as a marine um i've since woke up from that take
[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:35.340]  on general smetley butler's view on the the world and uh the gangsterism and all that
[03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:41.100]  well you can't find a better role model for a marine he's the most highly decorated marine in
[03:01:41.100 --> 03:01:47.820]  u.s history that's pretty hard two-time recipient of the uh congressional medal of honor um hey i
[03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:52.540]  called uh jerry brownfield yesterday i heard the end of his show i don't normally listen to his show
[03:01:52.540 --> 03:01:56.060]  but he had a guest on there talking about a book that was written like a hundred years ago called
[03:01:56.060 --> 03:02:00.860]  the coming battle yes we've sold that book in the past we don't anymore but it was written in
[03:02:01.420 --> 03:02:06.060]  1898 about how the private banks were going to take over america and how this wasn't a foreign
[03:02:06.060 --> 03:02:10.700]  government taking over it was a new type of threat a corporate takeover kind of like the
[03:02:10.700 --> 03:02:16.300]  british east india company took over china yeah it was fascinating i thought i heard you speak on it
[03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:23.740]  years ago by the way you did wake me up back in 2005 um can i can i give a quick uh a review on a
[03:02:23.740 --> 03:02:30.780]  product yeah go ahead uh i uh in the mail received something yesterday that i had uh ordered last
[03:02:30.780 --> 03:02:35.980]  week i got it within six days but but those were patriots out there that have ak-47 style rifles
[03:02:36.540 --> 03:02:40.140]  if you have one of those small little grips and you have a hard time controlling the point
[03:02:40.140 --> 03:02:49.260]  name of the weapon i i highly recommend this product by taptoe uh it's called a sa w m m249
[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:55.420]  style grip uh it's like the grips we used on our m249 light machine guns and the marines but
[03:02:55.420 --> 03:03:01.260]  it is perfect for the ak-47 setup what is it like a little bar that sticks out on the bottom
[03:03:01.900 --> 03:03:08.460]  no well no no no no this is the actual primary pistol grips uh seated behind the trigger guard
[03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:13.260]  oh because that's all so little larger and it allows you to get a lot i have a lot more control
[03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:21.900]  of the weapon it's very ergonomical it's just very very good so you like the 7.6239 uh type rifles
[03:03:22.460 --> 03:03:28.220]  yeah i got rid of uh my ars years ago i bought into all the propaganda about the seven sticks uh
[03:03:28.220 --> 03:03:33.820]  two by 39 millimeter i think it's good for for busting things up whereas the oh it certainly
[03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:37.980]  is up close and well i mean if you want something that isn't gonna fail on you and it's guaranteed
[03:03:37.980 --> 03:03:44.940]  nothing like the collision a cough is there no no mine's all black uh but this sawgrip has turned

[03:07:12.780 --> 03:07:18.300]  your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[03:07:18.300 --> 03:07:23.580]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[03:07:23.580 --> 03:07:28.860]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[03:07:28.860 --> 03:07:33.980]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[03:07:33.980 --> 03:07:38.540]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[03:07:38.540 --> 03:07:43.100]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators
[03:07:43.100 --> 03:07:47.340]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[03:08:05.820 --> 03:08:26.780]  gcn radio network we're gonna get ron paul's take on the oil spill and on the federal elections
[03:08:26.780 --> 03:08:31.980]  commission witch hunt against him and of course what's happening the incredible developments
[03:08:31.980 --> 03:08:36.860]  in the economy i mean i cannot stress to you to have how serious it is to have
[03:08:38.620 --> 03:08:44.860]  seeing in the associated press reuters everybody's saying oh the un says get rid of the dollar is the
[03:08:44.860 --> 03:08:50.700]  world reserve currency and have s dr is run by the imf and world bank i mean this is world
[03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:57.980]  government this is total bondage by these crooks and simultaneously in europe in greece everywhere
[03:08:57.980 --> 03:09:03.500]  they have engineered the collapse of these economies on record and then take the financial
[03:09:03.500 --> 03:09:08.220]  reform act that just passed the house now they've got to reconcile it with the senate version
[03:09:09.020 --> 03:09:17.900]  even the washington post admitted in an article last friday that it's six hundred trillion dollars
[03:09:18.620 --> 03:09:24.460]  that's owed to these bankers we it's owed because they just made up the money and claim we owe it
[03:09:24.460 --> 03:09:29.420]  literally it's derivatives it's made up but they're claiming we owe it because they're in control
[03:09:29.420 --> 03:09:35.660]  and that this allows them to take over the entire industries economic industries in this country the
[03:09:35.660 --> 03:09:43.020]  financial industry and anything that affects the economy so it's a financial dictatorship it's
[03:09:43.020 --> 03:09:47.820]  given the federal reserve more power in fact guys i had that article from friday highlighted
[03:09:47.820 --> 03:09:51.980]  and i looked for it for like 30 minutes this morning i can't find it in all my stacks if you
[03:09:51.980 --> 03:09:56.060]  go search engine i forget the exact name of the washington post article but it was about the
[03:09:56.060 --> 03:10:03.020]  financial reform bill uh to pass senate i believe but if you just google financial reform bill
[03:10:03.020 --> 03:10:09.500]  washington post six hundred trillion because six hundred trillion was in the article it'll come up
[03:10:09.500 --> 03:10:13.740]  so just washington post financial reform bill six hundred trail because i want to have that
[03:10:13.740 --> 03:10:18.620]  and quote that to ron paul when he's on okay let's hurry through your calls brian in north carolina

[03:10:46.860 --> 03:10:52.620]  like hitler style once they bring in all these snakes into the office and get rid of people
[03:10:52.620 --> 03:11:01.340]  like ron paul and ran paul they'll have complete control of the capital exactly and and most the
[03:11:01.340 --> 03:11:06.620]  snakes in government are cfr council and foreign relations that openly writes they want a one world
[03:11:06.620 --> 03:11:13.340]  government openly wants a north american union openly wants secret arrest of citizens uh openly
[03:11:13.340 --> 03:11:19.980]  wants all this tyranny and all these new wars openly wants weather modification the cfr calls for
[03:11:19.980 --> 03:11:27.660]  that openly wants cashless society world government and the government's just full of cfr
[03:11:27.660 --> 03:11:33.100]  which is the corporate governance body it's full of all these harvard people it's full of all these
[03:11:33.100 --> 03:11:39.020]  goldman sacks people this is a private corporate takeover of our country and it's happening now
[03:11:39.020 --> 03:11:45.900]  i appreciate your call brian lauren in minnesota you're on the air i like yes go ahead hear me
[03:11:45.900 --> 03:11:50.380]  prison planet uh watching on prison planet here i just wanted to give you an update from the twin
[03:11:50.380 --> 03:11:57.500]  cities um i'm a healthcare worker as well but i'm not striking but we have uh on tuesday 12 000 rms
[03:11:57.500 --> 03:12:02.300]  getting ready to strike on tuesday i've got several dozens of videos uh getting ready to
[03:12:02.300 --> 03:12:05.820]  get out there on the strike lines and wake them up i urge everyone else to do the same
[03:12:05.820 --> 03:12:15.340]  um divide and conquer by the obama obama care obama care um also um pioneer press june 28th
[03:12:15.340 --> 03:12:23.900]  front front page news new documents reveal um inspectors knew the bridge could collapse and
[03:12:23.900 --> 03:12:30.460]  this is i wanted a highly suspicious related to the nafta superhighway wanted to get your uh
[03:12:30.460 --> 03:12:38.620]  uh comment on that if any and uh i know a friend in uh transportation he just received he's a
[03:12:38.620 --> 03:12:46.060]  wait to he just received a first observer card from homeland security italk reports suspicious
[03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:53.340]  activities call homeland security anyways that's all i had alex i could uh get your comments please
[03:12:53.340 --> 03:12:57.660]  well that's part of infraguard of course then get all getting our old tattletale cards
[03:12:57.660 --> 03:13:01.020]  and that would be fine if we didn't have a corrupt government that can't be trusted
[03:13:01.020 --> 03:13:04.620]  and then of course they always start you out looking for al-qaeda but the training then turns
[03:13:04.620 --> 03:13:10.860]  into look for gun owners look for veterans look for patriots they're evil but your other question
[03:13:10.860 --> 03:13:17.820]  was dealing with what i forget now answering the bridge part uh june 28th pioneer press new
[03:13:17.820 --> 03:13:25.900]  documents reveal inspectors knew the bridge had potential to collapse well i haven't seen that
[03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:29.900]  article but we all remember the famous minnesota bridge collapse that became such a big diversion
[03:13:29.900 --> 03:13:35.260]  and then they used that to push for a north american union claiming that that would somehow fund new
[03:13:35.260 --> 03:13:41.740]  roads as if more taxes paid to offshore groups would help our country but i seem to remember
[03:13:41.740 --> 03:13:48.860]  seeing articles about and i'm going from memory here but over 30 percent of bridges in us may
[03:13:48.860 --> 03:13:54.140]  collapse anytime uh that came out that over 30 in fact search engine that to make sure i'm accurate
[03:13:54.140 --> 03:14:02.460]  this is about three years ago uh 30 percent of bridges in in danger of collapsing and so
[03:14:02.460 --> 03:14:06.540]  for them to say that they had reports from the engineers that a bridge could collapse
[03:14:06.540 --> 03:14:11.820]  there are engineers that are good men and women and who are part of highway departments nationwide
[03:14:11.820 --> 03:14:17.820]  who constantly it turned out i'm going from memory on this but filed reports saying yes this
[03:14:17.820 --> 03:14:22.700]  bridge is in danger that bridge is in danger all these bridges are in danger of collapsing
[03:14:22.700 --> 03:14:28.940]  and then they just don't get repaired i mean our railways when when my grandmother was going to
[03:14:28.940 --> 03:14:38.140]  college uh she would jump on the bullet train to get her phd uh three days a week and shoot
[03:14:38.140 --> 03:14:45.740]  this is after my dad was born uh and shoot down from from teague texas on the railhead there
[03:14:45.740 --> 03:14:53.180]  all the way to houston for the day to go to college and the train would get there in less than an
[03:14:53.180 --> 03:14:59.100]  hour and get back in less than an hour and you're talking about 150 miles the train went over 100
[03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:06.140]  miles an hour this was in the 50s those same rail beds now you can't go on a train more
[03:15:06.140 --> 03:15:10.140]  than 50 miles an hour because they don't repair them they don't fix the beds they don't fix the
[03:15:10.140 --> 03:15:16.220]  rails uh our roads are the same uh you can drive 150 miles an hour on german roads not here
[03:15:17.100 --> 03:15:21.740]  because the money doesn't go to build the roads it goes to line the pockets of the bankers
[03:15:21.740 --> 03:15:27.100]  so yes i have seen the reports uh not just in minnesota i haven't seen that particular one
[03:15:27.100 --> 03:15:31.820]  where they know bridges and trestles everywhere on the verge of collapsing and they're collapsing
[03:15:31.820 --> 03:15:37.580]  all the time so i appreciate your call really good points uh up next here is gem in illinois gem

[03:16:43.180 --> 03:16:50.220]  male i don't understand anything anymore this isn't the country i grew up in this isn't the country i

[03:16:59.900 --> 03:17:04.300]  just getting worse and worse uh we have people that don't care about the country in a future
[03:17:04.300 --> 03:17:10.060]  they care about robbing and getting total power and control now uh let's go ahead and take another
[03:17:10.060 --> 03:17:16.460]  call here uh let's go ahead and talk to brian and denise brian you're on the air hey alex how's it
[03:17:16.460 --> 03:17:21.900]  going good sir uh long-time listener first-time caller uh there's a couple things i want to talk
[03:17:21.900 --> 03:17:29.420]  to you about uh your phrase corporate takeover is uh very adequate um i did want to ask you a
[03:17:29.420 --> 03:17:35.500]  question uh something that i heard um uh someone i don't agree with on everything but i do believe
[03:17:35.500 --> 03:17:43.260]  he is correct on a few things uh david ike said that the virginia company still owns this uh
[03:17:43.260 --> 03:17:49.100]  quote-unquote country um but they just simply changed their name to the united states he wrote
[03:17:49.100 --> 03:17:54.460]  that one of his books uh a guide to the global conspiracy it's on page 231 is that is that true
[03:17:56.380 --> 03:18:04.300]  say that again he said that the british crown uh that owns the or that owned the virginia company
[03:18:04.300 --> 03:18:14.460]  uh simply uh changed their their name um under several pseudonyms as he refused as he says as
[03:18:14.460 --> 03:18:22.700]  u s u s a united states of america washington dc district of columbia etc and that this country
[03:18:22.700 --> 03:18:32.140]  is technically still being run by the crown there's some truth to that but people also
[03:18:32.140 --> 03:18:37.580]  say the united states is a corporation chartered in delaware and that's not actually true um
[03:18:37.580 --> 03:18:42.540]  it's a little more sophisticated than that but deals were made with the british crown
[03:18:43.340 --> 03:18:49.180]  as part of the armistice and in the end of the war where we did sign treaties with england and
[03:18:49.180 --> 03:18:53.980]  some of the holdings of british corporations they were allowed to keep most of them uh they weren't
[03:18:53.980 --> 03:19:01.020]  but there's no doubt the district of columbia uh is now operating as an outside force and it itself
[03:19:01.020 --> 03:19:07.180]  has been part of a corporate takeover since 1933 it was taken over by the bank of england at that time
[03:19:08.060 --> 03:19:11.420]  and the council and farm relations was established by british intelligence
[03:19:12.220 --> 03:19:18.540]  so yes globalism is just the british empire by stealth globalization is treason by its very
[03:19:18.540 --> 03:19:23.660]  definition meanwhile they've got us all scared to death of men with turbines or 11 russian spies
[03:19:23.660 --> 03:19:27.820]  and you know all of that is going on and as i guess a threat at some level but it's the difference
[03:19:27.820 --> 03:19:33.260]  between being shot with a bb gun and being dropped into a meat grinder i mean just the orders of of
[03:19:33.260 --> 03:19:39.980]  of of a degree it is the british mercantile imperial model that is literally raping and robbing everything
[03:19:40.700 --> 03:19:46.540]  exactly and and and another question i have is that you know we have a military that can defend us
[03:19:46.540 --> 03:19:52.860]  from foreign invaders just like most countries have a military uh that's not a you know that's
[03:19:52.860 --> 03:19:59.580]  a pretty straightforward how do you how do you fight a monster like this i understand the question
[03:19:59.580 --> 03:20:05.340]  let me let me answer it hi this is peter crotch novel with miters resources as you know government
[03:20:05.340 --> 03:20:10.060]  spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy what are
[03:20:10.060 --> 03:20:14.460]  you doing right now to protect yourself financially are the majority of your assets tied up in the stock
[03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:19.740]  or bond market if so are those assets working for you or against you one thing is certain having
[03:20:19.740 --> 03:20:24.060]  physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy
[03:20:24.060 --> 03:20:27.900]  or the dollar your investment will never be worthless and it will protect you from that

[03:24:25.340 --> 03:24:27.900]  me
[03:24:36.860 --> 03:24:39.420]  ron paul scheduled to be joining us
[03:24:41.580 --> 03:24:45.500]  coming up in the next segment the caller had a great point how do you defeat an army that
[03:24:45.500 --> 03:24:55.420]  doesn't come openly bearing its standard how do you defeat a covert corporate army that comes in and
[03:24:55.420 --> 03:25:00.220]  builds takeover mechanisms that are actually businesses so as they're taking you over they're
[03:25:00.220 --> 03:25:04.700]  making larger and larger profits so they're they're financing themselves all the way along
[03:25:05.260 --> 03:25:11.180]  a microcosm of that is the g20 bank heads openly have giant stock and all these private security
[03:25:11.180 --> 03:25:18.300]  firms they had canada pay tens of millions of dollars of their own security firms and gave them
[03:25:18.300 --> 03:25:24.140]  the authorization to arrest protesters and now it's come out that they weren't even licensed and
[03:25:24.140 --> 03:25:30.620]  there wasn't even a law they just lawlessly came in and had private security guns that cbc tv today
[03:25:30.620 --> 03:25:37.500]  and grabbed canadian citizens off the street impersonating officers and the cops don't care
[03:25:37.500 --> 03:25:42.940]  no one will be charged it's all selectively enforced then charlie veitch and activist jokes
[03:25:42.940 --> 03:25:49.180]  and calls himself the love police and so they arrest him and that's an example of how the
[03:25:49.180 --> 03:25:54.060]  corporate government is literally running everything i'm as i said earlier you read these spp
[03:25:54.060 --> 03:25:59.420]  documents and it's a north american union meeting and you've got the corporate governors there
[03:25:59.420 --> 03:26:05.340]  calling all of the shots they're there telling the secretary of states and the other heads of
[03:26:05.340 --> 03:26:10.620]  the bureaucracies in canada the united states in mexico what they're going to do the corporations
[03:26:10.620 --> 03:26:15.900]  will have a vote amongst themselves and then they will deliver that vote in the meeting to the
[03:26:15.900 --> 03:26:22.940]  politicians and then they will swear to develop it extra legislatively extra judicially through
[03:26:22.940 --> 03:26:29.260]  the executive and the bureaucracy and you've got the media heads there and they go and then instruct
[03:26:29.260 --> 03:26:35.820]  all of their underlings on the policy this is an outside corporate looting just like major
[03:26:35.820 --> 03:26:41.740]  corporations got together and went in 150 years ago or so and overthrew china and broke it up in
[03:26:41.740 --> 03:26:46.700]  many parts that's all i mean it's just kind of like private corporations were operating all over
[03:26:46.700 --> 03:26:50.540]  the united states when they were taken in from native americans and killing them or the british
[03:26:50.540 --> 03:26:55.900]  east india company in india i mean they would command british armies this is a british model if
[03:26:55.900 --> 03:27:01.100]  you read 200 years ago the british east india company more than 200 in some cases with huge
[03:27:01.100 --> 03:27:06.460]  battles with maharajas and other leaders that you know as they were conquering india it took them
[03:27:06.460 --> 03:27:12.620]  hundreds of years from their ports to build and expand and it would be huge british armies british
[03:27:14.220 --> 03:27:20.860]  and and scottish troops and and indian forces they trained lined up in just huge three four
[03:27:20.860 --> 03:27:25.900]  day long battles and the british east india company would be there commanding those operations
[03:27:26.700 --> 03:27:32.860]  and that's the new world order and so you go why is the media telling me about 11 russian spies and
[03:27:32.860 --> 03:27:37.260]  i should you know just literally have a heart attack and die why are they telling me about men
[03:27:37.260 --> 03:27:40.940]  in turbines that might kill me i better give all my rights up and then you get the government
[03:27:40.940 --> 03:27:45.020]  documents and all the trainings actually for you the american people see they tell you give up your
[03:27:45.020 --> 03:27:50.620]  rights and let a police state unfold to stop the ruskies or stop the arabs and i'm sure if you
[03:27:50.620 --> 03:27:55.900]  gave the ruskies unlimited power they would take over if you gave the arabs unlimited power they
[03:27:55.900 --> 03:28:01.180]  would that's the nature of humans but the group that has taken over and is raping us and has created
[03:28:01.180 --> 03:28:09.900]  600 trillion in derivatives and is doing all of this is the globalist globalism is tyranny
[03:28:09.900 --> 03:28:17.260]  globalism is treachery it is treason it is a corporate takeover of the united states
[03:28:17.260 --> 03:28:21.820]  what does medley butler say he said when big u.s corporations which aren't loyal to our country
[03:28:22.700 --> 03:28:26.860]  even you know 80 90 years ago whenever they wanted to take over a third world country they just
[03:28:26.860 --> 03:28:34.140]  send the marines down they take it over for corporate interest u as taxpayers would pay
[03:28:34.140 --> 03:28:40.780]  to send the leather next down there you know strong you know killers american killers wrapped in
[03:28:40.780 --> 03:28:46.780]  the american flag for the very robber barons that had murdered the indians and were murdering american
[03:28:46.780 --> 03:28:51.580]  squatters and people that started their own farms and ranches i've looked at the statistics
[03:28:51.580 --> 03:28:55.740]  there were almost as many white people killed by the railroad operatives and the gold mine
[03:28:55.740 --> 03:29:01.900]  operatives as there were native americans that's corporatism and it's fascism it's not free market
[03:29:02.540 --> 03:29:09.180]  so really nothing new under the sun uh this is a private mercenary army our military our police
[03:29:09.180 --> 03:29:15.340]  more and more the cia's had a coup of this country decades ago and they just completed their takeover
[03:29:15.340 --> 03:29:21.340]  when they killed kennedy and we as a society have to make a decision about all of this and whether
[03:29:21.340 --> 03:29:25.980]  or not we're going to let these offshore corporations that are engaged in a hostile corporate overthrow
[03:29:25.980 --> 03:29:30.300]  of our republic get away with it see they're getting rid of your due process your property

[03:33:25.340 --> 03:33:29.500]  he's got to go vote we appreciate him joining us i'm just not going to miss words i'm going to go
[03:33:29.500 --> 03:33:37.260]  through a laundry list of issues congressman as you know the FCC has said they want to start
[03:33:37.260 --> 03:33:41.980]  taking over the internet the federal communications commission we also have the federal trade
[03:33:41.980 --> 03:33:47.500]  commission saying they want to start taxing the internet and literally funding old line media
[03:33:47.500 --> 03:33:52.460]  that sounds like it violates the first amendment and so many others we have a kagan with their
[03:33:52.460 --> 03:33:58.940]  anti first amendment statements about disappearing speech that the government finds to be hurtful
[03:33:59.500 --> 03:34:02.940]  as long as the government feels it's a moral reason they can restrict our speech
[03:34:04.220 --> 03:34:09.020]  we've got the federal election commission coming after campaign for liberty as you put out your
[03:34:09.020 --> 03:34:15.820]  press release yesterday saying you can't put out letters telling people how members of congress
[03:34:15.820 --> 03:34:21.340]  have voted i mean this is 180 degrees the opposite of what our country was founded on
[03:34:21.340 --> 03:34:25.260]  i can't even believe this is happening can you speak to that and where this is going
[03:34:25.260 --> 03:34:30.860]  well it's going the wrong direction obviously and uh that that is what i understand about
[03:34:30.860 --> 03:34:36.300]  campaign for liberty they've had uh somebody at least make a charge and file a complaint
[03:34:37.020 --> 03:34:43.740]  that uh there was a violation but it probably won't hold up hopefully but the whole idea that
[03:34:43.740 --> 03:34:47.980]  people think they can and harass you and you go through this legal maneuvering because that is
[03:34:47.980 --> 03:34:53.020]  the goal of many is to control us i think the main goal is also to control the internet they're
[03:34:53.020 --> 03:34:57.740]  very interested in that the other day we had a sound like a pretty benign vote it was under
[03:34:57.740 --> 03:35:03.820]  suspension and that was to praise the idea that government and private entities would study
[03:35:04.380 --> 03:35:10.140]  and work together on how to provide cyber security and i don't know if there's anybody else that
[03:35:10.140 --> 03:35:15.500]  voted against it i voted against it just on this principle that we don't need that we don't need
[03:35:15.500 --> 03:35:20.780]  this private sources cooperating with the federal reserve but you know the government forces in
[03:35:20.780 --> 03:35:25.180]  order to have cyber security i don't think the government's interested in our security they're
[03:35:25.180 --> 03:35:31.020]  interested in their security but yes i think everything is moving and going especially with
[03:35:31.020 --> 03:35:36.220]  this administration is going the wrong direction and i've always been fearful of them wanting to
[03:35:36.220 --> 03:35:40.700]  take over the internet you know they've announced made this announcement that you know if necessary
[03:35:40.700 --> 03:35:46.140]  they might even just close down the internet which would be devastating to all of us well that's
[03:35:46.140 --> 03:35:50.860]  what Lieberman said on sienna and he said china has this power we need it and i would imagine
[03:35:50.860 --> 03:35:58.940]  they'll shut it down a few times but turn it right back on and say see we saved it unfortunately
[03:35:58.940 --> 03:36:06.620]  um i'm afraid that could very well happen well expanding on that uh two things and i want your
[03:36:06.620 --> 03:36:10.940]  specific take on this congressman ron paul we appreciate you joining us today this shows that
[03:36:10.940 --> 03:36:15.740]  we're really having an effect that they're harassing campaign for liberty that they're openly coming
[03:36:15.740 --> 03:36:20.780]  out and saying they want to restrict free speech put taxes quote on conspiracy theories and cast
[03:36:20.780 --> 03:36:26.140]  sunstein at the white house the regulations are said like anthropogenic global warming if you deny
[03:36:26.140 --> 03:36:32.060]  that maybe we should tax you or find you i mean the fact that they want to shut us up shows that
[03:36:32.060 --> 03:36:39.180]  we're gaining ground a and b doesn't it reveal to everyone just how tyrannical these people really are
[03:36:39.820 --> 03:36:46.220]  yeah i think it does and uh it's a real job to sort all this out because sometimes people think
[03:36:46.220 --> 03:36:50.700]  that all we need are a couple more republicans and i'll solve the problem but that's not necessarily
[03:36:50.700 --> 03:36:57.100]  the case right now the democrats who are in charge and they're the ones who are you know
[03:36:57.100 --> 03:37:04.460]  wanting to radicalize this whole whole thing and uh we know that that is the agenda of many
[03:37:04.460 --> 03:37:08.140]  you know in the establishment and that is more government control and less personal
[03:37:08.140 --> 03:37:17.260]  freedom more taxes the whole mess that we've been fighting but uh i i still you know hold out that
[03:37:17.260 --> 03:37:23.740]  the people people are waking up and uh and it may well be that the opposition that is the government
[03:37:23.740 --> 03:37:29.260]  is being very getting very concerned that the people are becoming alert from all that has
[03:37:29.260 --> 03:37:36.460]  been done in the freedom movement well senator demit reported that 94 percent of senate bills
[03:37:36.460 --> 03:37:42.380]  are not read i know the number in the house is similar uh and so 94 percent of the bills aren't
[03:37:42.380 --> 03:37:48.460]  even looked at special interest or writing and we've had an offshore corporate coup and then
[03:37:48.460 --> 03:37:54.540]  separately uh they passed the law in the house what two days ago to not let quote special interest
[03:37:54.540 --> 03:38:00.780]  tell you how someone is voted months before an election a restriction of free speech so
[03:38:01.260 --> 03:38:07.500]  they're not reading the bills and they don't want us to know how they voted and the fec is
[03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:12.860]  uh trying to keep campaign from liberty for being able to tell people how folks voted
[03:38:12.860 --> 03:38:19.340]  i mean this really is tyranny well yes and they they want to make sure that independent
[03:38:19.340 --> 03:38:24.220]  organizations and corporations can't spend their money or tell people how they vote but you know
[03:38:24.220 --> 03:38:31.260]  there are corporations and this is where i think you can fall into the category because if you run
[03:38:31.260 --> 03:38:37.100]  a newspaper you have a tv show that's a corporation can be a corporation but they're not going to
[03:38:37.100 --> 03:38:42.460]  regulate them so if there is an organization or a political action committee or a private group
[03:38:42.460 --> 03:38:47.340]  or corporation who wants to tell people how they vote no you might be restricted but they never
[03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:51.580]  think for a minute they they should restrict the media assuming that the media is always going to
[03:38:51.580 --> 03:38:58.220]  be radical left and defend their candidates but you know there's just a few people on uh on cable
[03:38:58.220 --> 03:39:03.980]  and radio and other places that uh they you know the way i would understand what they're doing they
[03:39:03.980 --> 03:39:10.540]  still haven't come to uh trying to regulate what the tv stations are saying or what the
[03:39:10.540 --> 03:39:17.020]  radios are saying congressman going into another very important subject i almost fell off my chair
[03:39:17.020 --> 03:39:23.500]  last friday when the washington post admitted in an article uh that they're set to pass the
[03:39:23.500 --> 03:39:29.020]  financial reform bill they admitted their 600 trillion in derivatives they went on that was the
[03:39:29.020 --> 03:39:33.100]  first time i'd seen that in the mainstream publication just to admit that the federal reserve
[03:39:33.100 --> 03:39:40.620]  is going to have a new uh group with almost total autonomy that was their words to control all other
[03:39:40.620 --> 03:39:46.460]  financial institutions the texas banking association president has said that the very groups that gave
[03:39:46.460 --> 03:39:51.180]  us derivatives with an unfair trade advance for themselves want to be able to take over all the
[03:39:51.180 --> 03:39:57.340]  smaller local banks and that really out of the crisis the big mega banks jp morgan chase goldman
[03:39:57.340 --> 03:40:02.620]  sax and others created they are now going to get even more power over the rest of the economy
[03:40:02.620 --> 03:40:09.100]  and that this is an expanded federal reserve coup of america can you elaborate on that and give us
[03:40:09.100 --> 03:40:14.860]  yeah and i think you uh you've described it rather well but that's not the way they claim it is
[03:40:14.860 --> 03:40:20.300]  you know they claim well this is going to protect the consumers it's not run by the fed they don't
[03:40:20.300 --> 03:40:26.460]  have authority but it's going to be in the federal reserve they do not have control over the policy
[03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:32.300]  but guess what guess who pays for it the federal reserve pays for it so it isn't even appropriation
[03:40:32.300 --> 03:40:37.980]  it isn't even you know part of the appropriation process so you have this new regulatory agency
[03:40:37.980 --> 03:40:43.420]  supposed to protect the consumer but i think it's going to protect uh the the special interest
[03:40:43.420 --> 03:40:49.580]  is about all the benefits and then then got bailed out so it's uh this this package which passed the
[03:40:49.580 --> 03:40:56.220]  house yesterday um you know is very bad for for all of us and it does give more power to all the
[03:40:56.220 --> 03:41:00.380]  regulators especially the federal reserve i don't know whether you want to talk about it now but
[03:41:00.380 --> 03:41:05.900]  that's where i offered my motion to recommit dealing with the audit defense bill you read were you
[03:41:05.900 --> 03:41:09.820]  up on that no that that's exactly where i wanted to go next i wanted to illustrate for listeners
[03:41:09.820 --> 03:41:14.380]  that just joined us that congressman ron paul is here 20 something years ago in congress
[03:41:14.380 --> 03:41:19.020]  he couldn't get one cosponsor and i wanted to make this point it seems the house and senator
[03:41:19.020 --> 03:41:25.660]  schizophrenic the house votes by two thirds uh to pass your bill to truly audit the quasi
[03:41:25.660 --> 03:41:31.580]  governmental uh banking holding company the federal reserve that took over in 1913 but then
[03:41:31.580 --> 03:41:36.860]  which is the right thing to do but never pass the senate properly uh and then now they're back
[03:41:36.860 --> 03:41:42.140]  giving the federal reserve even more power outside of government and congress uh to regulate
[03:41:42.140 --> 03:41:47.580]  themselves i mean this is amazing so uh break that oxymoron down for us and tell us about your
[03:41:47.580 --> 03:41:52.700]  new amendment well it tells you about uh the hypocrisy of this whole place and how it works
[03:41:52.700 --> 03:41:57.580]  and how powerful the fed is you're right we passed it in the financial services committee
[03:41:57.580 --> 03:42:03.820]  the audit the fed bill and uh it was part of the reform package then it came to the house floor
[03:42:03.820 --> 03:42:10.060]  and they kept it in so the house floor supported it we have 320 cosponsors then it goes to the
[03:42:10.060 --> 03:42:14.780]  conference with the senate and they drop it they put some things in there to look at the fed which
[03:42:14.780 --> 03:42:20.300]  are slightly helpful but they get rid of the the true audit so when the bill comes back to the house
[03:42:20.300 --> 03:42:26.140]  guess what we don't we don't have the audit bill provision in there so uh i was able to offer an
[03:42:26.140 --> 03:42:31.980]  amendment which was a recommitment amendment to send it back to committee and put back in the
[03:42:31.980 --> 03:42:39.660]  true audit and we had a up and down vote on that and we lost it by a significant amount 320 cosponsor
[03:42:39.660 --> 03:42:48.060]  and we lost it 114 people who were cosponsors of this bill switched and voted against the bill
[03:42:48.060 --> 03:42:54.140]  that they were cosponsors of so and now they've got the fed sicked on campaign for liberty and
[03:42:54.140 --> 03:43:00.380]  every other organization uh so that you can't tell the public that they flip flopped and engaged in
[03:43:00.380 --> 03:43:05.020]  treason they know that there's been a major political realignment not left or right but
[03:43:05.020 --> 03:43:11.020]  towards the constitution and that all incumbents across the country are either losing or on the
[03:43:11.020 --> 03:43:16.620]  verge of losing in the primaries and they are scared to death and they're trying to stop us
[03:43:16.620 --> 03:43:22.380]  from being able to communicate to them the truth this is treason against our way of government
[03:43:22.380 --> 03:43:27.660]  in our life i don't think they're going to stop the information from getting out it's uh you know
[03:43:27.660 --> 03:43:33.020]  the internet is at the moment still too big they can't control it people are going to find out and
[03:43:33.020 --> 03:43:38.940]  they still have access to government records and they can't find out who those 114 individuals were
[03:43:38.940 --> 03:43:46.780]  who flipped uh on this boat and uh you know if if we're worth our salt and this message is this uh
[03:43:46.780 --> 03:43:52.140]  this issue is important you know it will play a role in the in the elections it's all all right now
[03:43:52.140 --> 03:43:58.060]  i want to rock it through uh points with congressman ron paul and the time we've got uh left with him
[03:43:58.060 --> 03:44:05.180]  the way i read the supreme court ruling it's uh take two steps forward two steps back now the
[03:44:05.180 --> 03:44:09.020]  gun grabbers are hailing it as a victory saying well at least we've got a supreme court ruling
[03:44:09.020 --> 03:44:15.180]  saying we can now restrict the second amendment under law and so basically if you can jump through
[03:44:15.180 --> 03:44:22.140]  100 hoops maybe you can have access to a gun and keep it unloaded in your house uh and so uh yeah
[03:44:22.140 --> 03:44:28.940]  chicago you can't have a total ban uh but you can basically have almost a total ban but others are
[03:44:28.940 --> 03:44:34.460]  hailing this is a big victory congressman how do you see it well i keep my fingers crossed i'm still
[03:44:34.460 --> 03:44:40.460]  hoping that it will be because it's certainly perceived that way and the people who hate guns
[03:44:40.460 --> 03:44:46.460]  and don't believe we should have them they're hysterical they're going nuts so um i'm i'm uh
[03:44:46.460 --> 03:44:51.660]  hopeful that yes more people will have guns and more people will be able to defend themselves you
[03:44:51.660 --> 03:44:56.860]  know that things have improved slightly in washington i hope they've improved even if it's
[03:44:56.860 --> 03:45:02.620]  not the total package it will improve slightly in chicago and then uh maybe it will be of great
[03:45:02.620 --> 03:45:07.660]  benefit to it because what they'll probably find out is that the crime rate will go down uh it has
[03:45:07.660 --> 03:45:13.020]  in every other city so uh i haven't written it off saying that no this will won't improve things i
[03:45:13.020 --> 03:45:19.500]  think more people are going to have guns in uh in in chicago in order to defend themselves well i
[03:45:19.500 --> 03:45:24.540]  agree with you uh to a certain extent because i don't like having concealed carry because that
[03:45:24.540 --> 03:45:28.940]  turns a right into a privilege in states where it's already legal to carry a gun holstered but
[03:45:28.940 --> 03:45:35.340]  if you pass it in texas or florida and the crime rates drop by over 20 in both states the same
[03:45:35.340 --> 03:45:40.540]  numbers in other states even though it's a restriction to a certain extent it illustrates
[03:45:40.540 --> 03:45:46.220]  that more guns means less crime and so you win the overall intellectual war that's a powerful
[03:45:46.220 --> 03:45:51.580]  message and uh and i think more and more people are coming around to that and i think politically
[03:45:51.580 --> 03:45:56.540]  we generally have won this they sort of come into some of these regulations through the back door
[03:45:56.540 --> 03:46:02.060]  you know that in their last several elections the democratic candidate usually doesn't go out preaching
[03:46:02.060 --> 03:46:06.300]  about how he's going to round up the guns and register guns they stay away from that they pretend
[03:46:06.300 --> 03:46:10.620]  that oh we're not going to do that we're not going to do that but uh backdoor legislation
[03:46:10.620 --> 03:46:17.260]  they generate are always trying to do that let's talk about the oil spill uh and again just to
[03:46:17.260 --> 03:46:23.180]  preface this uh bp gave orders that they knew would cause a problem it turns out two months
[03:46:23.180 --> 03:46:27.660]  before it was leaking bp is one of the biggest contributors to obama they funded the carbon
[03:46:27.660 --> 03:46:33.820]  tax they've got a global governance office with the vice president over it uh they've always
[03:46:33.820 --> 03:46:38.860]  wanted to nationalize oil so they get an inside deal i'm very suspicious of how this has been
[03:46:38.860 --> 03:46:45.020]  handled we're 70 plus days in obama has blocked a taiwanese ship that can get half a million
[03:46:45.020 --> 03:46:51.180]  barrels a day scooped up uh they've blocked uh over 30 other mega ships now that the hurricanes
[03:46:51.180 --> 03:46:56.460]  are coming in he's saying he may look at letting them come in once that oil gets blown in they're
[03:46:56.460 --> 03:47:02.780]  going to have a major disaster the washington post is talking about forced evacuations obama's
[03:47:02.780 --> 03:47:09.420]  answer is give me the carbon tax ron emmanuel said don't let a good crisis go to waste i don't
[03:47:09.420 --> 03:47:16.460]  see this as obama versus bp as the media has phrased it really this is obama working with bp
[03:47:16.460 --> 03:47:21.900]  to try to get his carbon tax uh congressman uh this is out in international water uh why
[03:47:21.900 --> 03:47:26.780]  don't we just have the salvagers in there to begin with how can obama tell people 50 miles out in
[03:47:26.780 --> 03:47:32.540]  the gulf what to do well you forgot he he can write executive orders all right executive orders
[03:47:32.540 --> 03:47:39.900]  orders do anything they want um so it is a real mess you know if a state needs the manpower generally
[03:47:39.900 --> 03:47:44.860]  they don't have manpower that might be able to to help out that would be maybe their national
[03:47:44.860 --> 03:47:51.900]  guard units they're all over in in afghanistan in iraq i would say that you know if an emergency
[03:47:51.900 --> 03:47:55.900]  like this this might be an incentive say hey why don't you bring these troops home and maybe even
[03:47:55.900 --> 03:48:01.340]  some different states would share some of their their people to help i mean they're practically
[03:48:01.340 --> 03:48:08.460]  like an invasion the way this oil is coming in but i i think that uh yes i'm very suspicious of what
[03:48:08.460 --> 03:48:15.180]  bp and our government is doing in the obama administration and that's why i've even challenged
[03:48:15.180 --> 03:48:21.740]  the the principle of this uh this agreement they have to set up uh uh you know this fund this 20
[03:48:21.740 --> 03:48:27.020]  billion dollar fund sounds like a lot of money but it sounds like there could be a lot of mischief too
[03:48:27.020 --> 03:48:31.980]  and uh that was done by just executive order the president declared we're going to have this up
[03:48:31.980 --> 03:48:37.980]  and then he came to the congress and asked even for more authority to go any place asking questions
[03:48:37.980 --> 03:48:43.260]  and trying to figure out what to do yeah i saw a report that they're blocking i i'm sorry to
[03:48:43.260 --> 03:48:48.300]  interrupt uh i saw a report in the ap i said they're trying to block republican groups from going
[03:48:48.300 --> 03:48:53.260]  and looking at the gulf don't mean obama doesn't have that power yeah well he might take it he
[03:48:53.260 --> 03:48:58.940]  doesn't deserve that power but sometimes they assume power that they have but just uh you know
[03:48:58.940 --> 03:49:06.460]  no he doesn't that's not a proper power that he has so um i i'm not uh i'm not too pleased either
[03:49:06.460 --> 03:49:13.500]  and i think uh you know a bp corporation uh is in bed with government so you have to be suspect
[03:49:13.500 --> 03:49:18.860]  i just think of how much uh we spend protecting their oil well and their oil drawing what do you
[03:49:18.860 --> 03:49:23.100]  think we're over in the middle east for we're not over there to spread democracy we're over
[03:49:23.100 --> 03:49:30.220]  there to protect the oil companies and uh bp just happens to be over there as well uh did you see
[03:49:30.220 --> 03:49:34.460]  the video you probably did in two weeks ago but it was on drudge and info wars dot com everywhere
[03:49:34.460 --> 03:49:39.100]  else senator kyle said he was in a closed door meeting with obama and said look tens of thousands
[03:49:39.100 --> 03:49:44.300]  dead 80 miles to a hundred miles illegal aliens they're shutting down national parks the borders
[03:49:44.300 --> 03:49:50.300]  collapsing mexico's collapsed and obama said i'm not gonna fix the border till you pass amnesty
[03:49:50.300 --> 03:49:56.300]  i need to use that crisis this is a quote and and senator kyle said that this is basically
[03:49:56.860 --> 03:50:01.660]  holding us hostage in a form of terrorism i mean that sounds like an impeachable offense
[03:50:01.660 --> 03:50:07.100]  congressman and to have a senator say he was in a meeting with obama a what's your take on that
[03:50:07.100 --> 03:50:13.500]  and b uh i mean that is a false flag to let the crime continue and not protect our border when
[03:50:13.500 --> 03:50:18.860]  that's in the constitution one of the few duties of the feds what would you say to that well since
[03:50:18.860 --> 03:50:23.420]  i wasn't in that meeting and what exactly was said i don't know so it would have to be up to the
[03:50:23.420 --> 03:50:29.740]  senator decide what to do with it but uh he's they certainly don't act like they have an incentive
[03:50:29.740 --> 03:50:35.900]  to do much with the with the borders and uh that of course could eventually then to lead to a national
[03:50:35.900 --> 03:50:41.660]  security problem as well well okay congressman ron paul what about his executive order and now
[03:50:41.660 --> 03:50:47.100]  they say they're going to sue arizona and and they're saying arizona isn't allowed to protect
[03:50:47.100 --> 03:50:52.780]  itself when a third of the state is now being denied to the citizens i mean this is this is
[03:50:52.780 --> 03:50:59.260]  confirmed uh what's your view on the constitutionality of an executive order uh by the president to
[03:50:59.260 --> 03:51:06.060]  legalize the illegals well he can't do it you know laterally like that no congress would have to
[03:51:06.060 --> 03:51:11.820]  act and take a policy on that and and and write the rules the our federal government has authority
[03:51:11.820 --> 03:51:17.740]  over our borders but you know it should be that the private landowner should have a lot of authority
[03:51:17.740 --> 03:51:25.180]  as along with the states of sales with jurisdiction um and yet uh instead of permitting them to exert
[03:51:25.180 --> 03:51:31.660]  their authority uh over their own land with its own private or the state uh the federal government
[03:51:31.660 --> 03:51:36.380]  comes in and says you can't do it so they're acting uh perversely to what i think the federal
[03:51:36.380 --> 03:51:42.460]  government ought to be doing congressman i know you're a busy man but have you had a chance to
[03:51:42.460 --> 03:51:49.740]  watch kegan and the hearings and then expanding on that all of her open statements about socialism
[03:51:49.740 --> 03:51:55.020]  being great and the government can disappear speech going back to that uh are are are you
[03:51:55.020 --> 03:52:01.820]  concerned about kegan well i am but uh i'm sure if he put ten new ones up in place of her i'd be
[03:52:01.820 --> 03:52:08.380]  very concerned too i haven't watched the hearings but i've read about her and uh she certainly is
[03:52:08.380 --> 03:52:14.220]  not going to be a great defender of the constitution although uh uh she's going to make it sound like
[03:52:14.220 --> 03:52:21.420]  she is so uh i i'm not too encouraged with that appointment for sure congressman uh what's your
[03:52:21.420 --> 03:52:26.780]  take on the russian spy situation it seems like they're trying to kick off a new cold war with
[03:52:26.780 --> 03:52:34.060]  that and my my issue is globalization is treason globalization is corporations and megabanks
[03:52:34.060 --> 03:52:39.100]  taking over our government and so what is the difference between russian spies sneaking around
[03:52:39.100 --> 03:52:45.580]  and mega corporations coming in and openly buying off our politicians yeah i i think this is a
[03:52:45.580 --> 03:52:51.820]  little bit of hype i i think even the media the the mainstream media is sort of making fun of all
[03:52:51.820 --> 03:52:58.860]  this and i think rightfully so uh they just didn't look like a great threat uh to me and uh i had
[03:52:58.860 --> 03:53:05.340]  somebody in for a lunch at today that was sort of uh knowledgeable about this and he said that
[03:53:05.340 --> 03:53:10.860]  he said that there's so much spying going on in the world other countries come in here they're
[03:53:10.860 --> 03:53:16.460]  doing routinely and we're all over the place all over the world and and it's almost he described
[03:53:16.460 --> 03:53:23.660]  it almost like a game they play i mean it's really not serious intrigue and my guess is that uh
[03:53:23.660 --> 03:53:28.700]  people like to stir things up to scare the people and who knows i hope it doesn't lead to another
[03:53:28.700 --> 03:53:34.060]  cold war with the russians i don't think they're looking for trouble and uh we we certainly shouldn't
[03:53:34.060 --> 03:53:38.540]  be looking for it either all right congressman ron paul we appreciate your time in closing
[03:53:38.540 --> 03:53:42.620]  and i know you'll say well if i was president i would only have the powers of the president but
[03:53:42.620 --> 03:53:47.420]  what would you recommend what would you do if ron paul would have been elected back in 2008
[03:53:47.420 --> 03:53:52.060]  as we all wish you would have been uh you know forecasting everything that's now happened
[03:53:52.060 --> 03:53:57.500]  if you would have been elected what would you have done with the oil spill and what would you be doing
[03:53:57.500 --> 03:54:02.940]  now i'd probably work at getting away getting the government out of the way i would have done
[03:54:02.940 --> 03:54:09.340]  everything possible to alleviate any federal restrictions on the states or property owners
[03:54:09.340 --> 03:54:15.820]  i would have accepted anybody who had an offer to come in and and help i would have worked to remove
[03:54:16.380 --> 03:54:27.260]  any uh liability limitations on uh on on bp and uh i would have uh of course and by that time be
[03:54:27.260 --> 03:54:31.420]  by the time we had the oil spill i would have had all the guard units back in individual
[03:54:31.420 --> 03:54:36.540]  vigil states and they would have had the right to use their guard units as they as they pleased
[03:54:36.540 --> 03:54:41.100]  and i would actually encourage other guard units uh and not pretend the guard units
[03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:46.620]  belong to the president but they belong to the states and the government and i think they um
[03:54:46.620 --> 03:54:52.220]  they could have done a lot to alleviate some of the some of the damage i do not believe that
[03:54:52.220 --> 03:54:56.860]  there would have been any magic with any one individual who said oh i know how to cap this
[03:54:56.860 --> 03:55:02.860]  thing let me do it i actually do believe they're trying seriously to to stop this i don't think
[03:55:02.860 --> 03:55:09.980]  it serves anybody's benefit but uh i think right now the assumption is that the government
[03:55:09.980 --> 03:55:14.700]  you know didn't have a role to play and what they did was actually made this worse because
[03:55:14.700 --> 03:55:20.300]  of the rules of pushing them out into deep sea drilling that was part of the problem too
[03:55:20.300 --> 03:55:26.220]  but i would not have closed down drilling like uh obama wants to do that uh that's not going to
[03:55:26.220 --> 03:55:31.420]  help us that just makes the unemployment problem that much worse well the russians and the chinese
[03:55:31.420 --> 03:55:35.580]  and the people in brazil all the they're not stopping drilling in the gulf we don't own the
[03:55:35.580 --> 03:55:40.940]  gulf he's just stopped any companies in the us i mean this is this is outrageous and they're
[03:55:40.940 --> 03:55:45.420]  going to use it to pass cap and trade congressman ron paul everybody's got to get behind campaign
[03:55:45.420 --> 03:55:49.020]  for liberty they got to get behind rand paul we're going to win this and we appreciate
