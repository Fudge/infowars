[00:00.000 --> 00:18.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, so much is happening, so much is moving so incredibly quickly.
[00:18.920 --> 00:28.880]  This morning I was hiking around in the Hill Country with some friends and I just, it hit
[00:28.880 --> 00:36.240]  me so hard the fact that I wanted to come on air and thank all of the White Hat hackers
[00:36.240 --> 00:42.240]  that are the true heroes in this 21st century war against tyranny who have been going in
[00:42.240 --> 00:50.600]  and exposing the criminal activities of the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton, George Soros,
[00:50.600 --> 00:54.600]  the United Nations, the Rockefeller Foundation and others.
[00:54.600 --> 01:00.520]  And as we identify who runs this world government, it's going to be impossible for them to ever
[01:00.520 --> 01:03.040]  be able to carry out their operations.
[01:03.040 --> 01:08.880]  They are very arrogant, they are stuck in another century, they are basically being
[01:08.880 --> 01:11.240]  destroyed in front of our very eyes.
[01:11.240 --> 01:15.480]  This is an amazing moment that we're witnessing.
[01:15.480 --> 01:21.040]  You know, if info wars gets hacked, you just find out we're good people fighting hard.
[01:21.040 --> 01:26.020]  The globalists get hacked, you find out they're hardcore criminals, but those of us that research
[01:26.020 --> 01:27.400]  already know how bad they are.
[01:27.400 --> 01:33.640]  This is just proving word for word what we have said they're going to do because I read
[01:33.640 --> 01:37.840]  books, they wrote and things, but you get the emails, it's even worse obviously because
[01:37.840 --> 01:39.720]  it's internal.
[01:39.720 --> 01:45.320]  Yesterday it comes out going through the thousands, tens of thousands of George Soros emails
[01:45.320 --> 01:48.520]  that indeed they want the UN to take over the internet.
[01:48.520 --> 01:53.320]  This is from years ago, it's now happening in a month, exactly one month from now, October
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.320]  1st.
[01:54.320 --> 02:00.840]  This is so epic, I can hardly even talk at this point, and that they're going to selectively
[02:00.840 --> 02:05.240]  censor everyone that they don't agree with and give preferential treatment to his open
[02:05.240 --> 02:12.760]  society groups, which are basically the legion of doom meets the quantum group from the James
[02:12.760 --> 02:16.840]  Bond movies, which is actually the name of his group because he is the character that
[02:16.840 --> 02:19.680]  things like Spectre are based on.
[02:19.680 --> 02:25.760]  You cannot make up the magnitude of the evil we're facing, and then the latest today leaked
[02:25.760 --> 02:33.640]  memo reveals Soros plan for federally controlled police, quiet overhaul of justice system to
[02:33.640 --> 02:39.280]  selectively only target conservatives, you already see that happening.
[02:39.280 --> 02:48.640]  This is unbelievable, and of course, it's all public already because we have the Strong
[02:48.640 --> 02:49.640]  Cities Initiative.
[02:49.640 --> 02:53.520]  Sure, we get their leaked memos and people seize on those because they should because
[02:53.520 --> 02:57.120]  they're internal, but what about the Strong Cities Initiative?
[02:57.120 --> 03:02.120]  Loretta Lynch says the UN is going to run through the Justice Department, our police
[03:02.120 --> 03:03.120]  departments.
[03:03.120 --> 03:04.600]  This is May Day level insanity.
[03:04.600 --> 03:10.320]  When I say May Day, that's the communist day, I mean that is a double entendre and look
[03:10.320 --> 03:13.560]  at Drudge Report again, talk about on the pulse of what's happening.
[03:13.560 --> 03:17.560]  This morning I went to infowars.com and I looked at the video we put out Sunday and
[03:17.560 --> 03:19.320]  only had like 180,000 views.
[03:19.320 --> 03:23.760]  I can put out some little side issue video that gets, you know, 3 million, 5 million,
[03:23.760 --> 03:26.120]  10 million, 20 million.
[03:26.120 --> 03:31.680]  We have videos with 20 million views just on one video, and I thought, man, I really
[03:31.680 --> 03:35.160]  need you to get on air tomorrow and push this and beg the listeners to make it as big as
[03:35.160 --> 03:39.440]  they can, and maybe I named it the wrong thing when I said, you know, Hillary, please stop
[03:39.440 --> 03:40.440]  killing people.
[03:40.440 --> 03:41.440]  Please don't kill me.
[03:41.440 --> 03:42.440]  I should name it.
[03:42.440 --> 03:47.080]  Special report proving Hillary is a murderer, and that's what it proves, and then it has
[03:47.080 --> 03:48.080]  her bragging about it.
[03:48.080 --> 03:55.720]  It's a very powerful report, only like 20% is about me, but I've had to hire security
[03:55.720 --> 04:02.720]  because of some stuff that's been going on, and we're going to be basically letting folks
[04:02.720 --> 04:04.400]  know more about that in the near future.
[04:04.400 --> 04:08.720]  This is a serious situation, but Alex Jones asked Clinton not to kill him.
[04:08.720 --> 04:12.440]  That's deadcenter at drudgerport.com, and I want to thank the Drudge Report and Matt
[04:12.440 --> 04:16.160]  Drudge because I'm trying to, you know, defend the free press.
[04:16.160 --> 04:17.160]  He's defending the free press.
[04:17.160 --> 04:18.600]  We're all defending each other.
[04:18.600 --> 04:24.400]  Basically, circle the wagons here, ladies and gentlemen, from these wolves, but I'm
[04:24.400 --> 04:27.520]  asking the listeners, please, please, it was just crazy.
[04:27.520 --> 04:32.080]  I was already thinking, I'm going to ask everybody to really push this video, this report today,
[04:32.080 --> 04:35.960]  and then I come into the office, and there it is on Drudge, so thank you, Drudge.
[04:35.960 --> 04:43.520]  That just shows the synchronicity, serendipity, providence, but thank you because few people
[04:43.520 --> 04:47.200]  are at the next level of having to deal with the Clintons, and Drudge is one of those people
[04:47.200 --> 04:51.680]  longer than I have, but tend to deal with them, so it's kind of a scary fraternity to
[04:51.680 --> 04:55.200]  be in, but it's a very honorable one to be in.
[04:55.200 --> 04:57.440]  We'll be right back with all the huge news.
[04:57.440 --> 05:00.440]  It's an epic, epic broad jest.
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.600]  Images have emerged of Iran's Fordo-uranium enrichment facility of a Russian-made S-300
[05:05.600 --> 05:10.280]  surface-to-air missile raised where the sky, the so-called counter-attack weaponry, was
[05:10.280 --> 05:13.960]  referenced by Iran's Brigadier General Farswad Ismaili.
[05:13.960 --> 05:19.120]  He says one main priority is to protect Iran's nuclear facilities under any circumstances.
[05:19.120 --> 05:22.720]  Today, Iran's sky is one of the most secure in the Middle East.
[05:22.720 --> 05:27.440]  The images were spotted within hours after Iran's religious leader, Ayaz Holohamini,
[05:27.440 --> 05:32.040]  spoke to Iranian Air Force commanders saying, quote, continued opposition and hype of the
[05:32.040 --> 05:36.480]  S-300 or the Fordo site are examples of the viciousness of the enemy.
[05:36.480 --> 05:40.800]  The S-300 system is a defense system, not an assault one, but the Americans did their
[05:40.800 --> 05:42.920]  best for Iran not to get a hold of it.
[05:42.920 --> 05:46.920]  Now, any provocation by Iran's government could challenge the original deal with Iran
[05:46.920 --> 05:49.000]  with the lifting of U.S. sanctions.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.840]  Americans that say Iran must dismantle most of the 19,000 centrifuges that are in rich
[05:52.840 --> 05:56.920]  uranium, leaving 5,000 only for the purpose of, quote, research.
[05:56.920 --> 05:59.720]  I'm Margaret Howell, reporting for Infowars.com.
[05:59.720 --> 06:20.840]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I get in here
[06:20.840 --> 06:34.200]  and just
[06:34.200 --> 06:37.680]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems
[06:37.680 --> 06:39.680]  that will blow your socks off.
[06:39.680 --> 06:41.200]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while,
[06:41.200 --> 06:43.720]  but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce.
[06:43.720 --> 06:46.120]  I went home about 6.45 this morning,
[06:46.120 --> 06:47.800]  took three hours of sleep, got up,
[06:47.800 --> 06:49.840]  took two more Brainforce and came in.
[06:49.840 --> 06:53.440]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products
[06:53.440 --> 06:58.440]  at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[07:00.240 --> 07:04.160]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 Formulation.
[07:04.160 --> 07:08.280]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic
[07:08.280 --> 07:10.520]  and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[07:10.520 --> 07:12.120]  That's why for real results,
[07:12.120 --> 07:15.400]  so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections,
[07:15.400 --> 07:17.760]  which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[07:17.760 --> 07:20.480]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce
[07:20.480 --> 07:22.720]  that we can bring you our most bioactive,
[07:22.720 --> 07:24.960]  powerful form of B12 that has been developed
[07:24.960 --> 07:26.840]  with our exclusive, perfected process.
[07:26.840 --> 07:30.280]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade,
[07:30.280 --> 07:33.080]  bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12,
[07:33.080 --> 07:36.040]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections,
[07:36.040 --> 07:37.840]  and adenosylcobalamin.
[07:37.840 --> 07:39.840]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth,
[07:39.840 --> 07:41.480]  right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[07:41.480 --> 07:43.400]  No needles, no injections.
[07:43.400 --> 07:45.000]  Don't take my word for it.
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.280]  Try it for yourself.
[07:46.280 --> 07:48.480]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[07:56.520 --> 07:58.880]  InfoWars Life, Secret 12.
[07:58.880 --> 08:00.880]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[08:00.880 --> 08:02.880]  in the heart of the resistance.
[08:02.880 --> 08:30.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:30.880 --> 08:33.480]  Something incredible is happening.
[08:33.480 --> 08:35.400]  Something amazing is happening.
[08:35.400 --> 08:38.160]  It's like free humanity, regardless of what color we are,
[08:38.160 --> 08:40.680]  where we're from, or even what religious background,
[08:40.680 --> 08:44.520]  are syncing up and seeing through propaganda
[08:44.520 --> 08:46.800]  and disinformation so fast.
[08:46.800 --> 08:48.800]  A few of the examples I'm about to throw out
[08:48.800 --> 08:52.560]  are petty or silly, but still, they're very illustrative
[08:52.560 --> 08:55.720]  or emblematic.
[08:55.720 --> 09:01.040]  An example of that is last week, I saw a Mark Dice video
[09:01.040 --> 09:04.640]  on infowars.com, where he said it looks like that the pickle
[09:04.640 --> 09:06.920]  jar was already open with Hillary,
[09:06.920 --> 09:10.840]  a stunt show that she's really healthy on Jimmy Kimmel.
[09:10.840 --> 09:13.120]  And so I came in here into the comedy piece
[09:13.120 --> 09:15.800]  and played caddyshack clips and said,
[09:15.800 --> 09:20.400]  I think that it was a fake event, that it was staged,
[09:20.400 --> 09:25.360]  because the pickle jar didn't pop, but I had fun with it.
[09:25.360 --> 09:28.040]  It was in thousands of publications.
[09:28.040 --> 09:29.480]  It was on CNN.
[09:29.480 --> 09:30.760]  It was on ABC News.
[09:30.760 --> 09:34.480]  I'm told it was all over the place.
[09:34.480 --> 09:35.680]  I could put in Picklegate.
[09:35.680 --> 09:37.800]  There'd be thousands of articles making fun of me.
[09:37.800 --> 09:38.680]  But something happened.
[09:38.680 --> 09:41.360]  In the comments, folks went, pickle jars do pop.
[09:41.360 --> 09:42.600]  This is a stunt.
[09:42.600 --> 09:44.200]  You're being political, Kimmel, so it's
[09:44.200 --> 09:45.320]  OK for him to cover it.
[09:45.320 --> 09:47.200]  Almost everyone turned against him.
[09:47.200 --> 09:51.560]  Almost all of the response by the internet was very positive.
[09:51.560 --> 09:53.680]  People pointed out that I was having fun with it
[09:53.680 --> 09:56.760]  in the full piece and that they were misrepresenting.
[09:56.760 --> 10:01.080]  Wolf Blitzer goes on last night, makes jokes about the pop,
[10:01.080 --> 10:02.040]  the pop, the pop.
[10:02.040 --> 10:03.960]  They say, lavaliers won't pick up the pop.
[10:03.960 --> 10:04.720]  I'm wrong.
[10:04.720 --> 10:08.160]  They open it and it pops.
[10:08.160 --> 10:09.960]  And Blitzer has some trouble at first.
[10:09.960 --> 10:11.480]  There's something about you being watched trying
[10:11.480 --> 10:12.640]  to open something.
[10:12.640 --> 10:15.200]  It's like Samson having his hair cut off that weakens you.
[10:15.200 --> 10:16.800]  I experienced that myself.
[10:16.800 --> 10:18.240]  So he's straining with it for real.
[10:18.240 --> 10:19.120]  It's not moving.
[10:19.120 --> 10:20.280]  And then it pops.
[10:20.280 --> 10:22.480]  And they're like, whoa, it popped.
[10:22.480 --> 10:23.920]  And they cut right there and don't show you
[10:23.920 --> 10:24.960]  what happened after that.
[10:24.960 --> 10:26.520]  Basically, I'm going to play that clip.
[10:26.520 --> 10:28.360]  We have all these world events taking place.
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.560]  The reason I'm covering this is that they were really
[10:32.560 --> 10:33.560]  trying to attack me.
[10:33.560 --> 10:37.480]  And then the audience goes, ooh, and it pops.
[10:37.480 --> 10:40.160]  And see, I sat there at my dining room
[10:40.160 --> 10:43.080]  table with Pat Riley before we went and worked out that morning.
[10:43.080 --> 10:44.040]  And I said, you watch.
[10:44.040 --> 10:44.920]  This is going to get big.
[10:44.920 --> 10:46.160]  This is going to get picked up.
[10:46.160 --> 10:48.560]  The public's been trained subliminally to only care
[10:48.560 --> 10:50.600]  about petty stuff.
[10:50.600 --> 10:53.080]  The general public, I'm going to do something petty on pickles.
[10:53.080 --> 10:54.320]  It's going to be huge.
[10:54.320 --> 10:56.720]  I bet Kimmel picks it up.
[10:56.720 --> 11:00.360]  And again, it's that I know how they operate.
[11:00.360 --> 11:02.040]  And it's blown up in their face.
[11:04.480 --> 11:06.200]  Silly little petty stuff like this
[11:06.200 --> 11:07.880]  is what can bring them down.
[11:07.880 --> 11:09.960]  It's like getting Al Capone on his tax returns,
[11:09.960 --> 11:12.600]  not the thousands of murders.
[11:12.600 --> 11:16.080]  Now, that said, it's happening again.
[11:16.080 --> 11:17.760]  Last week, Roger Stone's come on the mar,
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.560]  by the way, with big breaking news.
[11:23.560 --> 11:25.520]  And I've got to be careful what I say is a lot of this.
[11:25.520 --> 11:29.040]  It's going to be released till tomorrow.
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.840]  But digressing from that, there were articles
[11:33.840 --> 11:35.960]  in hundreds of newspapers, everything
[11:35.960 --> 11:40.920]  from an online publications that Alex Jones went too low
[11:40.920 --> 11:41.480]  this time.
[11:41.480 --> 11:44.040]  Alex Jones really did it.
[11:44.040 --> 11:44.960]  He's attacking women.
[11:44.960 --> 11:46.120]  He's attacking their genitals.
[11:46.120 --> 11:51.320]  He's basically a digital rapist is what some articles said.
[11:51.320 --> 11:53.080]  Media matters run by the White House said,
[11:53.080 --> 11:55.240]  Trump allies, Roger Stone and Alex Jones
[11:55.240 --> 11:58.600]  discussed whether human-abidance genitals were mutilated.
[11:58.600 --> 12:04.160]  Her mother works and pushes at journals.
[12:04.160 --> 12:05.960]  Sexual mutilation is a good thing.
[12:05.960 --> 12:07.160]  That's what we were talking about.
[12:07.160 --> 12:08.080]  And I knew that.
[12:08.080 --> 12:12.680]  I thought everybody knew that because it
[12:12.680 --> 12:14.440]  was in the news years ago.
[12:14.440 --> 12:17.160]  They didn't even check to see if it was true
[12:17.160 --> 12:18.680]  and said I was a liar.
[12:18.680 --> 12:22.240]  And now it's all over the news that her mother advocates it
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.280]  and pushes it and for Sharia law all over the world.
[12:26.280 --> 12:30.760]  Just like Matine's dad pushes the mass shooter dad
[12:30.760 --> 12:33.040]  and shows up at the Hillary rally.
[12:33.040 --> 12:39.680]  Or just like we have Khan starting an Islamic journal
[12:39.680 --> 12:41.720]  and getting huge foreign funding, that's
[12:41.720 --> 12:44.960]  where he started to push Sharia law in the West.
[12:44.960 --> 12:48.200]  I mean, these people are pushing Sharia law.
[12:48.200 --> 12:51.640]  10 years ago, I thought that was some extreme right wing,
[12:51.640 --> 12:54.320]  you know, neo-Khan warmongering disinfo
[12:54.320 --> 12:56.200]  that Muslims would really try to come here
[12:56.200 --> 12:59.440]  and take over the Democratic Party and push Sharia.
[12:59.440 --> 13:00.080]  They were right.
[13:00.080 --> 13:02.520]  It was so extreme, I couldn't believe it.
[13:06.480 --> 13:07.920]  These people are out of control.
[13:07.920 --> 13:09.760]  The Democrats will ally with anyone
[13:09.760 --> 13:11.640]  that will bring down this country so they can control it.
[13:11.640 --> 13:13.840]  These people are enemies of the state,
[13:13.840 --> 13:15.920]  enemies of the people.
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.240]  It came out yesterday.
[13:17.240 --> 13:19.440]  I would never have thought Hillary wasn't just
[13:19.440 --> 13:22.880]  brokering deals for money from foreigners.
[13:22.880 --> 13:25.480]  Why did I think of that?
[13:25.480 --> 13:27.480]  That's my honesty, I just don't think like that.
[13:27.480 --> 13:30.120]  Even though I try to think like they do,
[13:30.120 --> 13:32.200]  I thought it was all these foreign governments paying her off
[13:32.200 --> 13:35.240]  to get good deals and to screw over American interests,
[13:35.240 --> 13:37.120]  which it was.
[13:37.120 --> 13:40.840]  The Chinese president, she was representing him as well,
[13:40.840 --> 13:43.040]  not even as a triple agent, just a go-through
[13:43.040 --> 13:45.520]  to screw everyone so you could get access
[13:45.520 --> 13:49.440]  to the Chinese president and get deals in China through her.
[13:49.440 --> 13:52.800]  Of course, of course.
[13:52.800 --> 13:55.080]  Good Lord, totally amoral.
[13:55.080 --> 13:58.600]  Nuclear reactors in North Korea that can create A-bombs
[13:58.600 --> 14:02.320]  and hydrogen bombs, the entire Long March missile system
[14:02.320 --> 14:03.600]  of our ICBMs.
[14:03.600 --> 14:07.600]  These people are, look, there's a world government model.
[14:07.600 --> 14:09.600]  The globalists have set it up, but do you know why
[14:09.600 --> 14:10.600]  globalism is falling?
[14:10.600 --> 14:12.600]  I always talked to a lot of really top politicos
[14:12.600 --> 14:14.600]  and people like Paul Craig Roberts and others,
[14:14.600 --> 14:16.600]  and they'd say, Alex, it's more ineptitude than you're saying.
[14:16.600 --> 14:18.600]  Yes, there's a plan for globalism.
[14:18.600 --> 14:19.600]  Yes, it's serious.
[14:19.600 --> 14:21.600]  Yes, they want a world government, but son,
[14:21.600 --> 14:23.600]  they're all screwing each other over too.
[14:23.600 --> 14:25.600]  It's never going to work.
[14:25.600 --> 14:28.600]  And here's why it won't.
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.600]  Because they are screwing even the Anglo-American establishment.
[14:33.600 --> 14:38.600]  They're double and triple dealing at every level,
[14:38.600 --> 14:41.600]  and they can't even keep their new world order going
[14:41.600 --> 14:44.600]  because they're so dishonorable.
[14:44.600 --> 14:47.600]  They're the biggest enemy of their world government project.
[14:47.600 --> 14:49.600]  It's amazing.
[14:49.600 --> 14:53.600]  I mean, she represents the communist Chinese
[14:53.600 --> 14:58.600]  unelected dictator.
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.600]  Good Lord, arrest her immediately, immediately.
[15:03.600 --> 15:06.600]  You realize how illegal that is?
[15:06.600 --> 15:11.600]  I mean, this is out of control.
[15:11.600 --> 15:13.600]  And more and more comes out.
[15:13.600 --> 15:15.600]  More and more comes out.
[15:15.600 --> 15:18.600]  And I've got to tell you, I came up here Saturday and Sunday
[15:18.600 --> 15:19.600]  and worked with Rob Do.
[15:19.600 --> 15:21.600]  Rob Do worked.
[15:21.600 --> 15:24.600]  Seven days last week, he volunteered
[15:24.600 --> 15:27.600]  because he cares about his family and his children and you.
[15:27.600 --> 15:33.600]  And he was up here until 10 o'clock at night with me on Saturday.
[15:33.600 --> 15:36.600]  And then he worked almost through the night, slept three hours
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.600]  and worked till 4.30 when he got here with the 16-minute piece
[15:40.600 --> 15:43.600]  that's on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[15:43.600 --> 15:47.600]  And maybe 20% of the video is about myself
[15:47.600 --> 15:50.600]  and what it's like to know that Hillary's called me a dark heart
[15:50.600 --> 15:53.600]  and to know how she loves to kill people or audit people
[15:53.600 --> 15:56.600]  or destroy people or go after their families, you name it.
[15:56.600 --> 15:58.600]  But that I had to do it.
[15:58.600 --> 16:00.600]  And then the video, today I was going to come in and say, folks,
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.600]  this needs to really go viral.
[16:01.600 --> 16:02.600]  Help me make it go viral.
[16:02.600 --> 16:03.600]  I didn't ask Drudge that.
[16:03.600 --> 16:05.600]  And I fire up DrudgeReport.com.
[16:05.600 --> 16:06.600]  It's dead center.
[16:06.600 --> 16:09.600]  Alex Jones asked Clinton not to kill him.
[16:09.600 --> 16:14.600]  And notice, two days into this, I even predicted to do on Sunday night,
[16:14.600 --> 16:16.600]  I called him, I said, good job on that.
[16:16.600 --> 16:19.600]  Thank you for working so hard.
[16:19.600 --> 16:22.600]  And I said, watch, I don't think the press will pick it up
[16:22.600 --> 16:23.600]  unless Drudge picks it up.
[16:23.600 --> 16:27.600]  I said, because it's so dead on, they are so scared of this
[16:27.600 --> 16:30.600]  because just going back over her murders and her history
[16:30.600 --> 16:34.600]  and the illegal wars and how she's turned jihadis loose
[16:34.600 --> 16:36.600]  in all these different countries to kill people and brags about it,
[16:36.600 --> 16:43.600]  she is 100% guilty of mass murder and organized crime
[16:43.600 --> 16:46.600]  and illegal wars that Congress admits are illegal
[16:46.600 --> 16:49.600]  and funding jihadists in Al Qaeda,
[16:49.600 --> 16:51.600]  not just in the last five years,
[16:51.600 --> 16:54.600]  but when she was co-president with Bill.
[16:54.600 --> 16:58.600]  These are horrible people who I say are totally amoral.
[16:58.600 --> 16:59.600]  They're not.
[16:59.600 --> 17:02.600]  They'll screw globalist over and the Communist Chinese
[17:02.600 --> 17:05.600]  and double and triple deal and quadruple dip.
[17:05.600 --> 17:08.600]  But when they, they'll go out of their way
[17:08.600 --> 17:10.600]  and spend their own money to kill Christians
[17:10.600 --> 17:15.600]  and to overthrow Western culture because they're so evil
[17:15.600 --> 17:19.600]  that it's just like hide that light, you know, put that fire out.
[17:19.600 --> 17:20.600]  Close those blinds.
[17:20.600 --> 17:21.600]  I don't want to see that.
[17:26.600 --> 17:30.600]  Hillary Clinton is a demon and everybody knows
[17:30.600 --> 17:32.600]  it's real that I'm challenging her.
[17:32.600 --> 17:34.600]  It's real that Stephen Manning is challenging her.
[17:34.600 --> 17:37.600]  It's real that Matt Drudge is challenging her
[17:39.600 --> 17:42.600]  and all the harassment that undoubtedly Drudge has gone through
[17:42.600 --> 17:46.600]  and I'm just going to stop right there.
[17:46.600 --> 17:48.600]  People ask, why is Matt Drudge reclusive?
[17:48.600 --> 17:51.600]  Well, I mean, I'm getting reclusive quite frankly.
[17:51.600 --> 17:53.600]  This is not fun, but it's our duty.
[17:53.600 --> 17:54.600]  And here's the good thing.
[17:54.600 --> 17:55.600]  We can put the info out.
[17:55.600 --> 17:56.600]  It can be proven to be accurate.
[17:56.600 --> 17:59.600]  You can spread it with basically no risk to yourself
[17:59.600 --> 18:01.600]  unless they fully take over.
[18:01.600 --> 18:04.600]  Then it's censorship on everybody and it only gets worse.
[18:04.600 --> 18:07.600]  But they'll win if we don't speak up.
[18:07.600 --> 18:12.600]  The only way you're not safe is not taking action now.
[18:12.600 --> 18:15.600]  So I'm going to ask you to go to drudgerport.com.
[18:15.600 --> 18:17.600]  I was going to repost at the front page of InfoWars today
[18:17.600 --> 18:18.600]  and we're doing that.
[18:18.600 --> 18:20.600]  But the easiest thing to do is just go to drudgerport.com
[18:20.600 --> 18:27.600]  and to post it to Facebook, Twitter, and every other website you can
[18:27.600 --> 18:30.600]  and to tell people at work.
[18:30.600 --> 18:31.600]  People are worried.
[18:31.600 --> 18:34.600]  I mean, you've got all these Clinton women that were raped
[18:34.600 --> 18:35.600]  that are faring for their lives.
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.600]  Well, absolutely, a guy jogs up to your rural house.
[18:37.600 --> 18:40.600]  I've had these women on and says, where's your doggy?
[18:40.600 --> 18:42.600]  Or where's your kitty?
[18:42.600 --> 18:47.600]  Oh, it didn't do too good at the end.
[18:47.600 --> 18:50.600]  How are your kids doing?
[18:50.600 --> 18:53.600]  But I mean, at a certain point, does the whole world just bow down?
[18:53.600 --> 18:56.600]  Don't you get we've got a better chance fighting them politically
[18:56.600 --> 18:57.600]  than rolling over?
[18:57.600 --> 18:59.600]  The whole Republican establishment is against Trump.
[18:59.600 --> 19:03.600]  That's the total endorsement of Trump.
[19:03.600 --> 19:06.600]  Nigel Farage is coming up today.
[19:06.600 --> 19:08.600]  Live.
[19:08.600 --> 19:10.600]  George Washington, New Europe.
[19:10.600 --> 19:13.600]  We've got Lord Moncton coming on about all these UN treaties
[19:13.600 --> 19:14.600]  to take over the Internet.
[19:14.600 --> 19:16.600]  But it's all happening, people.
[19:16.600 --> 19:21.600]  I'm reposting at infowars.com, basically under the title.
[19:21.600 --> 19:25.600]  Here is the proof that Hillary Clinton is a mass murder.
[19:25.600 --> 19:27.600]  That's really what 80% of the video is.
[19:27.600 --> 19:30.600]  It chronicles that.
[19:30.600 --> 19:33.600]  And it's a very important video.
[19:33.600 --> 19:36.600]  And I'm asking listeners to get it out to everyone they know.
[19:36.600 --> 19:38.600]  Turns out Jesse Jackson previously praised Trump
[19:38.600 --> 19:42.600]  for the amount of African-Americans and other minorities he hired
[19:42.600 --> 19:45.600]  because they've done the studies, they've tried to go look at it to demonize him
[19:45.600 --> 19:50.600]  and all it does is prove Trump hires more minorities.
[19:50.600 --> 19:54.600]  It's almost a way to go after him, really, if you're really a hardcore conservative,
[19:54.600 --> 19:57.600]  that he does bring in guest workers, you name it.
[19:57.600 --> 20:00.600]  And he pays women a lot, he advances women.
[20:28.600 --> 20:31.600]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[20:31.600 --> 20:34.600]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.
[20:34.600 --> 20:36.600]  Savory and delicious.
[20:36.600 --> 20:39.600]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[20:39.600 --> 20:40.600]  Awesome.
[20:40.600 --> 20:44.600]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life NASA pack technology.
[20:44.600 --> 20:45.600]  Bacon.
[20:45.600 --> 20:49.600]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon.
[20:49.600 --> 20:51.600]  Or warm and served.
[20:51.600 --> 20:53.600]  Life-saving, ready to eat bacon.
[20:53.600 --> 20:55.600]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[20:55.600 --> 20:58.600]  That's free at fullycookedbacon.com.

[21:59.600 --> 22:00.600]  Think about this.
[22:00.600 --> 22:04.600]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[22:04.600 --> 22:09.600]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines,
[22:09.600 --> 22:12.600]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[22:12.600 --> 22:17.600]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[22:17.600 --> 22:20.600]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.

[23:27.600 --> 23:35.600]  The one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[23:35.600 --> 24:00.600]  The one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[24:00.600 --> 24:19.600]  The one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[24:19.600 --> 24:24.600]  You know, I tried to put the different times when Hillary Clinton bragged about killing people
[24:24.600 --> 24:31.600]  and made fun of countries she'd bombed with uranium and just all the other sickening statements.
[24:31.600 --> 24:33.600]  But there's so many you can't put them all in there.
[24:33.600 --> 24:39.600]  So obviously we're going to have more reports that come out, not just the one that's dead smack dab in the middle of DrudgeReport.com.
[24:39.600 --> 24:42.600]  Alex Jones asked Clinton not to kill him.
[24:42.600 --> 24:48.600]  And obviously Drudge is baiting the media there to draw attention to this and to this powerful video.
[24:48.600 --> 24:50.600]  Try to give us all a little more protection.
[24:50.600 --> 24:54.600]  And they can have all the snot nose media establishment pundits make fun of us.
[24:54.600 --> 24:57.600]  But the public doesn't believe you.
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.600]  You have a 6% trust rate dumb dumb.
[25:01.600 --> 25:13.600]  Alternative media is over 80 in most major studies because people trust something that has thousands of flavors that they can check for themselves or raw video or documents.
[25:13.600 --> 25:21.600]  If my video was an establishment video, it would be 10 minutes of pundits talking and one clip of me saying something out of context.
[25:21.600 --> 25:26.600]  This is almost all clips of Hillary Clinton and her cohorts.
[25:26.600 --> 25:28.600]  But I'd even forgotten about this.
[25:28.600 --> 25:30.600]  I should have put this audio in.
[25:30.600 --> 25:37.600]  Remember the child rape victim Hillary admits this that as a lawyer, she represented someone who she knew was guilty.
[25:37.600 --> 25:39.600]  You know what? That's fine.
[25:39.600 --> 25:43.600]  You don't have to laugh about it and make sick jokes about it and relish it.
[25:43.600 --> 25:51.600]  And then she goes on to protect Bill Clinton the serial rapist and is used during the bimbo eruptions as the fake feminist to give Bill cover.
[25:51.600 --> 25:55.600]  She's a predator.
[25:55.600 --> 25:59.600]  She reportedly before she got so ill is a handful of beach men upside the head women.
[25:59.600 --> 26:01.600]  She wears the pants.
[26:01.600 --> 26:03.600]  She admires Janet Reno.
[26:03.600 --> 26:11.600]  She got caught in the back of a car outside Miami when she was the district attorney with a 12 year old girl covered in vomit.
[26:11.600 --> 26:16.600]  She used to go check the kids out of the juvie and take them for a little spin for five or six hours.
[26:16.600 --> 26:18.600]  These are some pigs.
[26:18.600 --> 26:19.600]  Now, let's go.
[26:19.600 --> 26:21.600]  They're tough though.
[26:21.600 --> 26:25.600]  It takes a lot drag girl out of a juvie.
[26:25.600 --> 26:27.600]  This is people sick.
[26:27.600 --> 26:29.600]  But this is criminal energy.
[26:29.600 --> 26:31.600]  Normal people just won't even think of this stuff.
[26:31.600 --> 26:33.600]  Just said sounds crazy.
[26:33.600 --> 26:41.600]  Just like Abedin's mother running the main journals that push worldwide for women to be sexually mutilated.
[26:41.600 --> 26:44.600]  And how great it is because it stops them having bad desires.
[26:44.600 --> 26:46.600]  This is a group of fruits.
[26:46.600 --> 26:48.600]  Anti-liberal scum.
[26:48.600 --> 26:50.600]  Good Lord help us.
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.600]  And the left loves it because they're not the left.
[26:54.600 --> 26:56.600]  They're trash.
[26:56.600 --> 27:00.600]  And I told you all this and now it's all over the news.
[27:00.600 --> 27:03.600]  All the words pushing it.
[27:03.600 --> 27:05.600]  And the media attacks me and says I'm making it up.
[27:05.600 --> 27:08.600]  No I'm not.
[27:08.600 --> 27:12.600]  It's been proven that it's in all over the news today.
[27:12.600 --> 27:16.600]  But meanwhile child rape victims comes out against Clinton.
[27:16.600 --> 27:19.600]  This happened 1975.
[27:19.600 --> 27:21.600]  41 years ago and it's coming out.
[27:21.600 --> 27:23.600]  All the ghosts are coming out.
[27:23.600 --> 27:25.600]  All of them coming back.
[27:25.600 --> 27:31.600]  At the end of the hunger when all the guys are coming out of the coffins and going after the queen.
[27:31.600 --> 27:34.600]  Dragging her into the coffin with them.
[27:34.600 --> 27:36.600]  Let's go to this clip.
[27:36.600 --> 27:38.600]  Kathy Shelton.
[27:38.600 --> 27:39.600]  Here it is.
[27:39.600 --> 27:45.600]  If I ever had to meet her in person it would be very hard for me not to walk up and smack her.
[27:45.600 --> 27:47.600]  I know that sounds to me.
[27:47.600 --> 27:51.600]  From the Daily Mail Hillary Clinton represented Thomas Alfred Taylor.
[27:51.600 --> 27:56.600]  This is a defense attorney in his first criminal case in Arkansas 1975.
[27:56.600 --> 28:00.600]  Taylor was convicted but only ended up serving a few months behind bars.
[28:00.600 --> 28:04.600]  I mean she put me through a lot at 12 years old.
[28:04.600 --> 28:09.600]  I mean I had to go look through this window and I did these guys.
[28:09.600 --> 28:12.600]  I just wanted to know you got a daughter and a grandbaby.
[28:12.600 --> 28:19.600]  What happens if that daughter of yours if that would have been her and they pulled you in at that time to do that.
[28:19.600 --> 28:21.600]  What would you do?
[28:21.600 --> 28:24.600]  You would defend her.
[28:24.600 --> 28:26.600]  I want this woman to serve as a good microphone.
[28:26.600 --> 28:30.600]  You don't know me so I'll be scrapped to you.
[28:30.600 --> 28:35.600]  It cares about me as long as you can win your first case as an attorney.
[28:35.600 --> 28:38.600]  And that was her first case ever.
[28:38.600 --> 28:45.600]  The Washington Free Beacon released tape recordings of the 1980 conversation where Hillary Clinton talked about the 1975 rape case with leisure.
[28:45.600 --> 28:46.600]  With relish.
[28:46.600 --> 28:47.600]  Pleasant is heard.
[28:47.600 --> 28:49.600]  What does it say?
[28:49.600 --> 28:51.600]  I hope it's positive.
[28:51.600 --> 28:52.600]  She passed.
[28:52.600 --> 28:54.600]  I'll never say nothing.
[28:54.600 --> 28:56.600]  I would hurt her.
[29:00.600 --> 29:02.600]  They took it.
[29:02.600 --> 29:03.600]  They passed it.
[29:03.600 --> 29:04.600]  She nearly was guilty.
[29:04.600 --> 29:09.600]  After laughing on that tape and stuff she's pretty well stuck in knowing that she lied.
[29:09.600 --> 29:11.600]  Knowing that it happened to me.
[29:11.600 --> 29:14.600]  It's horrible you know because she's supposed to be for women and children in here.
[29:14.600 --> 29:18.600]  She is saying well I know they did it but I defended them anyway.
[29:18.600 --> 29:23.600]  I think she got her both off on the technicality of losing something.
[29:23.600 --> 29:25.600]  And she lost it on purpose.
[29:25.600 --> 29:27.600]  It wasn't lost.
[29:27.600 --> 29:30.600]  How could all this stuff get lost all of a sudden?
[29:30.600 --> 29:33.600]  I'm trying to get the hoax to record.
[29:33.600 --> 29:34.600]  Alright we'll be back.
[29:34.600 --> 29:36.600]  The full video is up on infowars.com.
[29:36.600 --> 29:39.600]  Rapists need to be lined up and shot.
[29:39.600 --> 29:41.600]  Anybody ever touches my daughters?
[29:41.600 --> 29:44.600]  You better hope the law gets to you before I do.
[29:44.600 --> 29:46.600]  That's a guaranteed promise.
[29:46.600 --> 30:12.600]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[30:16.600 --> 30:23.600]  NBC affiliate WPTV had reported she lost the race before the votes had even been tallied.
[30:23.600 --> 30:30.600]  WPTV showed Laurel getting 45% of the votes and losing the election.
[30:30.600 --> 30:34.600]  She took to Facebook and posted this to all my Facebook friends.
[30:34.600 --> 30:38.600]  Election fraud is already taking place here in Palm Beach County.
[30:38.600 --> 30:43.600]  WPTV is posting election results today when the race is on Tuesday.
[30:43.600 --> 30:49.600]  According to Bispect Review, the station WPTV claimed that they were just testing their election page
[30:49.600 --> 30:53.600]  in an effort to bring fast and accurate election results on election day.
[30:53.600 --> 30:56.600]  Well if you buy that, I got a bridge to sell you.
[30:56.600 --> 31:15.600]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.
[31:15.600 --> 31:30.600]  We're dealing with massive parasites, which is harmful to your body.
[31:30.600 --> 31:59.600]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[31:59.600 --> 32:03.600]  Clean, pure drinking water. You can't survive without it.
[32:03.600 --> 32:04.600]  But where do you get it?
[32:04.600 --> 32:10.600]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new groundbreaking gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[32:10.600 --> 32:16.600]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water,

[32:22.600 --> 32:28.600]  It removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses,
[32:28.600 --> 32:33.600]  fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[32:33.600 --> 32:35.600]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.

[33:00.600 --> 33:03.600]  Your search is elusive, so we have it even right there.
[33:03.600 --> 33:04.600]  This is need?
[33:05.600 --> 33:08.600]  This is an emergency transmission.
[33:11.600 --> 33:17.600]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in occupied North America.
[33:17.600 --> 33:22.600]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[33:22.600 --> 33:24.600]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[33:24.600 --> 33:27.600]  The time to choose sides has come.
[33:27.600 --> 33:29.600]  We are the resistance.
[33:29.600 --> 33:31.600]  We are the Info War.
[33:33.600 --> 33:38.600]  And you see in the information war going to high gear as the entire world.
[33:38.600 --> 33:46.600]  Hackers here in the U.S., hackers in Russia, hackers in the U.K., hackers in China,
[33:46.600 --> 33:53.600]  hackers in Mexico, all over the world assail the Democratic Party, the Republican establishment,
[33:53.600 --> 34:02.600]  the European Union criminals, the French government, Hillary Clinton, the DNC, all of it.
[34:02.600 --> 34:05.600]  And guess what? George Soros wants a world government, the U.N. running the Internet.
[34:05.600 --> 34:07.600]  It's all public now, in his emails.
[34:07.600 --> 34:11.600]  And the U.N. running our police departments via the Justice Department.
[34:11.600 --> 34:16.600]  Word for word. Word for word.
[34:16.600 --> 34:18.600]  What I told you.
[34:18.600 --> 34:20.600]  But I don't want to give myself credit.
[34:21.600 --> 34:24.600]  They say publicly this stuff too.
[34:26.600 --> 34:28.600]  That's what's so frustrating.
[34:29.600 --> 34:34.600]  Do folks understand 95% of what I talk about is admitted?
[34:34.600 --> 34:42.600]  I know 20 years ago when I talked about goats being spliced with spiders to create body armor in their milk.
[34:42.600 --> 34:44.600]  That was in scientific papers.
[34:44.600 --> 34:47.600]  It was not in the news at the time because I and others covered it a few years later.
[34:47.600 --> 34:49.600]  It was on the news.
[34:49.600 --> 34:52.600]  Still, people don't believe me today.
[34:52.600 --> 34:54.600]  Oh, there's a new tactic.
[34:54.600 --> 34:58.600]  By the way, I saw a bunch of articles this morning that we got hacked.
[34:58.600 --> 35:04.600]  Yeah, five years ago, and it's not even what they're saying it was.
[35:04.600 --> 35:07.600]  Everybody changed their password for prisonplanet.tv.
[35:07.600 --> 35:10.600]  So it was a non-issue.
[35:10.600 --> 35:14.600]  But that, again, is economic attack.
[35:14.600 --> 35:17.600]  They're so upset that the real hackers and the patriots are against them.
[35:17.600 --> 35:20.600]  So they're just trying to draw attention to us and hope stuff goes on.
[35:20.600 --> 35:22.600]  Hey, whatever folks want, you know, the new order to win.
[35:22.600 --> 35:23.600]  Fine.
[35:23.600 --> 35:26.600]  All I'm telling you is this is the epic battle of all time.
[35:26.600 --> 35:28.600]  And then it gets worse.
[35:28.600 --> 35:29.600]  Then it gets worse.
[35:29.600 --> 35:35.600]  They've now come out again saying that I said Obama sent the tornado to Oklahoma City a few years ago to distract from what he'd done.
[35:35.600 --> 35:39.600]  No, a caller called and asked, and I said they do have weather weapons.
[35:39.600 --> 35:45.600]  They can control major weather systems, but that this was probably a real tornado.
[35:45.600 --> 35:48.600]  I mean, weather weapons are on the history channel.
[35:48.600 --> 35:49.600]  They're on the weather channel.
[35:49.600 --> 35:52.600]  I mean, I've had been living to the father of weather weapons on.
[35:52.600 --> 35:55.600]  He was 90 years old at the time when it was declassified.
[35:55.600 --> 35:58.600]  This is all admitted, but then they misrepresent.
[35:58.600 --> 36:00.600]  But that's why they're so discredited.
[36:00.600 --> 36:07.600]  They're desperate now.
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.600]  There's a lot of big military news, a lot of huge political news.
[36:13.600 --> 36:15.600]  Look at drudgerport.com poll.
[36:15.600 --> 36:18.600]  Trump 3% up magazine.
[36:18.600 --> 36:21.600]  Well, if you do any real scientific poll, he's dead even or ahead.
[36:21.600 --> 36:31.600]  The problem is, is that they've been doing so many fake polls that it has an internal polling brought his numbers down closer to Hillary in battleground states.
[36:31.600 --> 36:34.600]  I mean, it's worked on weak minded people.
[36:34.600 --> 36:42.600]  Now, all of her scandals, despite the fact that they're manipulating these polls, have still brought Trump back up even in the stage polls.
[36:42.600 --> 36:46.600]  But it's just an exercise in mind control.
[36:46.600 --> 36:50.600]  And are the people that have been fooled so many times, are they ready to not be conned?
[36:50.600 --> 36:52.600]  But here's some of the others.
[36:52.600 --> 36:56.600]  Magazine.
[36:56.600 --> 36:58.600]  I'm a young black man and I support him.
[36:58.600 --> 37:00.600]  Michigan gets ready for visit.
[37:00.600 --> 37:03.600]  Clinton give Detroit jobs to Syrian refugees.
[37:03.600 --> 37:05.600]  She actually said that.
[37:05.600 --> 37:07.600]  These people are out of control.
[37:07.600 --> 37:11.600]  Obama dumping the new arrivals on the street.
[37:11.600 --> 37:12.600]  War.
[37:12.600 --> 37:16.600]  Media calls for even more aggressive Trump coverage.
[37:16.600 --> 37:20.600]  Yeah, the media is hyping itself up and saying, we don't need to be objective.
[37:20.600 --> 37:21.600]  Let's be more deceptive.
[37:21.600 --> 37:25.600]  I remember Billy Corgan, like a few weeks ago, sent me an email and said, why don't you cover this New York Times article?
[37:25.600 --> 37:26.600]  Well, I hadn't seen it.
[37:26.600 --> 37:27.600]  And you read it.
[37:27.600 --> 37:29.600]  It's like, it's just time to be deceptive.
[37:29.600 --> 37:32.600]  We just need to get rid of any objectivity.
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.600]  So they're having pep rallies to mainline their line.
[37:36.600 --> 37:38.600]  They're saying, we've only got 6% trust rate.
[37:38.600 --> 37:39.600]  What do we do?
[37:39.600 --> 37:40.600]  Well, let's use our disadvantage.
[37:40.600 --> 37:41.600]  I guarantee you this is being said in the meetings.
[37:41.600 --> 37:44.600]  Let's just go with it and hide it in plain view.
[37:44.600 --> 37:46.600]  It's called gaslighting.
[37:46.600 --> 37:47.600]  It's a psychological warfare tactic.
[37:47.600 --> 37:48.600]  They're using it.
[37:48.600 --> 37:49.600]  Is it working on you?
[37:49.600 --> 37:51.600]  I think it is working on some people.
[37:51.600 --> 37:52.600]  You saw the latest Mark Dice video.
[37:52.600 --> 37:53.600]  I didn't get to it yesterday.
[37:53.600 --> 37:55.600]  I'm going to air it today.
[37:55.600 --> 37:59.600]  Everyone he talks to doesn't know who Joe Biden is.
[37:59.600 --> 38:02.600]  The smarter ones go, isn't he in politics or something?
[38:02.600 --> 38:12.600]  But let me tell you, these people will look at you if you're wearing a Trump hat like you are a child molester.
[38:12.600 --> 38:21.600]  They are invincibly ignorant, invincibly stupid, invincibly moronic.
[38:21.600 --> 38:24.600]  And they're out there saying, Trump has flip-flopped on immigration.
[38:24.600 --> 38:29.600]  No, one of his campaign people came out and said, we'll clarify the specifics.
[38:29.600 --> 38:31.600]  And Trump says the specifics is, we're deporting the felons.
[38:31.600 --> 38:32.600]  First thing we're doing.
[38:32.600 --> 38:34.600]  And then we're going to make folks come here legally.
[38:34.600 --> 38:35.600]  Done.
[38:35.600 --> 38:36.600]  Boom.
[38:36.600 --> 38:37.600]  We're going to hire more board patrol.
[38:37.600 --> 38:38.600]  That is not a flip-flop.
[38:38.600 --> 38:41.600]  But see, he always said, it's really hard to come here legally.
[38:41.600 --> 38:48.600]  We're going to make it easier for good people, legal people from all over the world that want to work hard and don't have criminal records to come here.
[38:48.600 --> 38:51.600]  But let me tell you, Mexico is sending a lot of serious criminals into this country.
[38:51.600 --> 38:52.600]  A lot of really bad people.
[38:52.600 --> 38:53.600]  Mexico is in trouble.
[38:53.600 --> 38:55.600]  It's falling apart down there.
[38:55.600 --> 38:57.600]  And we're going to kick these criminals out.
[38:57.600 --> 39:00.600]  The type of criminals that have committed three, four murders.
[39:00.600 --> 39:04.600]  The type of criminals that have been deported seven times.
[39:04.600 --> 39:08.600]  Let's see, they just cut it down to Mexico is sending a lot of really, really bad people in.
[39:08.600 --> 39:11.600]  In this modern culture, the propaganda is really thin.
[39:11.600 --> 39:15.600]  But as Joseph Goebbels said, propaganda doesn't even need to be sophisticated.
[39:15.600 --> 39:22.600]  He goes, you want to dumb it down so that people get to feel like they own it.
[39:22.600 --> 39:24.600]  And their own laziness buys into it.
[39:24.600 --> 39:26.600]  So you get to be a victim now.
[39:26.600 --> 39:28.600]  Donald Trump hates Hispanics.
[39:28.600 --> 39:30.600]  Oh, I've been hurt.
[39:30.600 --> 39:32.600]  I get to be a victim.
[39:32.600 --> 39:39.600]  And then get to, but here's the deal, most Hispanics aren't buying into it and say, I just feel bullied by the other people that are telling me I should.
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.600]  And this is how I'm supposed to think, even though most of the numbers don't show that.
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.600]  But to a certain extent, it became a self fulfilling prophecy.
[39:47.600 --> 39:55.600]  You know, if you sell enough blonde haired pinatas, somebody then at least little kids start buying into the facts like the Jewish kid.
[39:55.600 --> 39:57.600]  Do we ever play those clips?
[39:57.600 --> 40:00.600]  I want to cue that up later where the Jewish kids are like, and Trump hates Hispanics.
[40:00.600 --> 40:02.600]  Trump hates Asians.
[40:02.600 --> 40:04.600]  He hates you.
[40:04.600 --> 40:06.600]  He hates me.
[40:06.600 --> 40:12.600]  The parents have like their five year olds crying that Donald Trump wants to put them in a gas chamber.
[40:12.600 --> 40:14.600]  That is child abuse, people.
[40:14.600 --> 40:16.600]  It's freakish.
[40:16.600 --> 40:19.600]  Yeah, yeah, let's back this up and actually play this here in a moment.
[40:19.600 --> 40:21.600]  Let's go ahead and play that for folks.
[40:21.600 --> 40:23.600]  As soon as we can.
[40:23.600 --> 40:24.600]  Here's the clip.
[40:24.600 --> 40:30.600]  Never Trump! Never Trump! Why do you like Trump? Why do you like him?
[40:30.600 --> 40:33.600]  Because he's racist. He hates Muslims. He wants to do the poor Muslims.
[40:33.600 --> 40:38.600]  And I have friends that are Muslims and he's mean to Jews that I'm a Jew too.
[40:38.600 --> 40:41.600]  What has he done to the Jews?
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.600]  He said a mean insult to Jews.
[40:45.600 --> 40:48.600]  He says mean insults to Jews.
[40:48.600 --> 40:50.600]  And yeah, he's mean.
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.600]  And he just says mean things to a quarter like Jews, beer, bread, things like that.
[40:55.600 --> 40:57.600]  He says mean things like that.
[40:57.600 --> 40:59.600]  What do you like?
[40:59.600 --> 41:01.600]  Kevin Clinton and John Kates.
[41:01.600 --> 41:03.600]  Okay, those are my favorites.
[41:03.600 --> 41:05.600]  Are you in public school?
[41:05.600 --> 41:06.600]  What?
[41:06.600 --> 41:07.600]  Do you go to public school?
[41:07.600 --> 41:10.600]  Yeah, it's Spring Break where we go to FCPS.
[41:10.600 --> 41:12.600]  It's down in...
[41:12.600 --> 41:14.600]  But I go to public school.
[41:14.600 --> 41:19.600]  Did you say most of your classmates are for Hillary or for Donald Trump?
[41:19.600 --> 41:22.600]  Yeah, no.
[41:22.600 --> 41:25.600]  I think all of my classmates hate Trump.
[41:25.600 --> 41:28.600]  They like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
[41:28.600 --> 41:30.600]  Alright, I mean this is pathetic.
[41:30.600 --> 41:33.600]  This little Jewish kid thinks Donald Trump's coming to get the Jews.
[41:33.600 --> 41:37.600]  I'm not even going to respond to that.
[41:37.600 --> 41:43.600]  The Trumps have, you know, married into Jewish families and things like that.
[41:43.600 --> 41:47.600]  I'm not going to get into the fact he's been a trailblazer for civil rights.
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.600]  I'm not going to get into the fact he's been a trailblazer for equal rights for homosexuals.
[41:52.600 --> 41:58.600]  I'm not going to even play Jesse Jackson a decade ago saying what a great person Donald Trump was
[41:58.600 --> 42:05.600]  trying to give him an award basically for hiring so many minorities and black people.
[42:05.600 --> 42:10.600]  And that's what Trump says he's going to do if he gets elected.
[42:10.600 --> 42:17.600]  He's going to come with building projects and businesses and factory incentives in your town.
[42:17.600 --> 42:21.600]  But I know we want Hillary Clinton who under her control, her and Obama,
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.600]  doubled black unemployment because they want everybody under their control.
[42:26.600 --> 42:29.600]  You want prosperity, you go for Donald Trump.
[42:29.600 --> 42:31.600]  You want to be a slave under the New World Order.
[42:31.600 --> 42:33.600]  I don't care what color you are, go with Hillary Clinton.
[42:33.600 --> 42:35.600]  A master criminal.
[42:35.600 --> 42:37.600]  There's not even a choice here.
[42:37.600 --> 42:39.600]  This is so obvious.
[42:39.600 --> 42:47.600]  Everybody can hold their nose and say, you know, well, I'm going to go for Gary Johnson because I'm a purist.
[42:47.600 --> 42:50.600]  Meanwhile, G20 summit to deal with rising anti-globalism.
[42:50.600 --> 42:51.600]  The globalists are meeting.
[42:51.600 --> 42:54.600]  The leaders of nations are meeting to try to organize.
[42:54.600 --> 43:02.600]  They admit and stop their own populations stopping them from stealing their sovereignty.
[43:02.600 --> 43:13.600]  That is a very, very important article that's on infowars.com and drudgereport.com
[43:13.600 --> 43:18.600]  where they openly admit and they've been in everything from the New York Times,
[43:18.600 --> 43:21.600]  the financial times of London, the economists hitting the panic button.
[43:21.600 --> 43:26.600]  In fact, there's the New York Times saying world governments in trouble.
[43:26.600 --> 43:28.600]  Our corporate takeovers in trouble.
[43:28.600 --> 43:33.600]  Every if she falls will be the next domino emergency, prop her up, do everything you can.
[43:33.600 --> 43:36.600]  So they've taken the gloves off and I thank God they have.
[43:36.600 --> 43:38.600]  They are discrediting themselves.
[43:38.600 --> 43:40.600]  They are cutting their noses off despite their faces.
[43:40.600 --> 43:46.600]  They are burning themselves down.
[43:46.600 --> 43:48.600]  One of our reporters went out to the gay pride parade.
[43:48.600 --> 43:50.600]  I'll play this after the break.
[43:50.600 --> 43:52.600]  Ashley did and they're just screaming.
[43:52.600 --> 43:53.600]  They hate Trump.
[43:53.600 --> 43:54.600]  He wants to hurt the gay people.
[43:54.600 --> 43:57.600]  I mean, this is the, this is the idiocy.
[43:57.600 --> 44:04.600]  They want to be with Uma Abedin whose mother says cut women's genitals off.
[44:04.600 --> 44:06.600]  She pushes it worldwide.
[44:06.600 --> 44:08.600]  She's like the main proponent.
[44:08.600 --> 44:10.600]  I didn't even realize that last week when I talked about it.
[44:10.600 --> 44:11.600]  I knew she was a big one.
[44:11.600 --> 44:15.600]  I didn't know she's like the lady saying cut your daughter's genitals off.
[44:15.600 --> 44:18.600]  These people are crazy.
[44:18.600 --> 44:20.600]  Their supporters are crazy.
[44:20.600 --> 44:21.600]  They're dumb.
[44:21.600 --> 44:25.600]  And what do you do when the general public acts like animals?
[44:25.600 --> 44:30.600]  The average Democratic Party voter acts dumber than a dog.
[44:30.600 --> 44:37.600]  They act like animals, but they have a weird obsession with tyranny and pushing it on you.
[44:37.600 --> 44:38.600]  I don't care what color they are.
[44:38.600 --> 44:39.600]  They're soft.
[44:39.600 --> 44:40.600]  They're stupid.
[44:40.600 --> 44:41.600]  They're weird.
[44:41.600 --> 44:51.600]  Their controllers are like, look like people out of a crime movie.
[44:51.600 --> 44:53.600]  They're crazed.
[44:53.600 --> 45:01.600]  Even the news is, oh, she worked at a journal that opposed women's rights.
[45:01.600 --> 45:06.600]  No, her mother wants to cut your genitals off.
[45:06.600 --> 45:07.600]  How do they counter that?
[45:07.600 --> 45:11.600]  They just have hundreds of newspapers come out last week and say, I'm a big liar.
[45:11.600 --> 45:12.600]  No, I'm not.
[45:12.600 --> 45:13.600]  No, I'm not.
[45:13.600 --> 45:16.600]  It's all the truth.
[45:16.600 --> 45:18.600]  And now it's out in the news today.
[45:18.600 --> 45:25.600]  Huma Abedin's mom linked a shocking anti-woman book that has written in the support of having
[45:25.600 --> 45:29.600]  young girls' genitals removed so they, quote, don't have pleasure.
[45:29.600 --> 45:35.600]  Why'd God put it there, then, you witch?
[45:35.600 --> 45:41.600]  She worked as the assistant editor of mother's radical journal, Muslim Journal, when it blamed
[45:41.600 --> 45:42.600]  America for 9-11.
[45:42.600 --> 45:46.600]  Now, the globalist and the Muslims working together are who did 9-11 to bring in the
[45:46.600 --> 45:47.600]  tyranny.
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.600]  Now, let's stop right there.
[45:51.600 --> 45:58.600]  The special report where I list and chronicle the crimes of Hillary and her admitted murders
[45:58.600 --> 45:59.600]  is on DrudgeReport.com.
[45:59.600 --> 46:01.600]  I'm asking everybody to get that and to send it to the forewings.
[46:01.600 --> 46:09.600]  I've also reposted it on infowars.com with a headline dealing with the fact that it chronicles
[46:09.600 --> 46:15.600]  her crimes, or at least I'd ask for it to be reposted when that is reposted.
[46:15.600 --> 46:44.600]  Now, I'm going to stop right there before I get to all the other news.
[46:44.600 --> 47:13.600]  I'm going to stop right there before I get to all the other news.
[47:13.600 --> 47:17.600]  Russian is now positioned troops at 20 miles from Alaska and is moving more troops up to
[47:17.600 --> 47:22.600]  the Ukraine border as NATO openly calls for war.
[47:22.600 --> 47:29.600]  And finally, before I get to more of this news, I want to remind listeners that we are
[47:29.600 --> 47:33.600]  listeners, supporters, and viewers, and that when you get a president-planet.tv membership
[47:33.600 --> 47:37.600]  for $5.95 a month, you can share it with up to 20 people on that same membership.
[47:37.600 --> 47:41.100]  That helps find the cameras and some of the crew and what we do is what we can then produce
[47:41.100 --> 47:45.600]  it and then the next day give almost all of it out free on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter
[47:45.600 --> 47:46.600]  to other places.
[47:46.600 --> 47:49.600]  The problem is they're censoring us more and more, so we have to have our own platform.
[47:49.600 --> 47:55.600]  So thank you for letting us basically have a mothership or command base.
[47:55.600 --> 48:22.600]  Thank you very much.
[48:22.600 --> 48:48.600]  Thank you very much.
[48:48.600 --> 49:14.600]  Thank you very much.
[49:14.600 --> 49:40.600]  Thank you very much.
[49:40.600 --> 50:06.600]  Thank you very much.
[50:06.600 --> 50:32.600]  Thank you very much.
[50:32.600 --> 50:59.600]  Thank you very much.
[50:59.600 --> 51:25.600]  Thank you very much.
[51:25.600 --> 51:51.600]  Thank you very much.
[51:51.600 --> 52:20.600]  Thank you very much.
[52:21.600 --> 52:47.600]  Thank you very much.
[52:47.600 --> 53:13.600]  Thank you very much.
[53:13.600 --> 53:39.600]  Thank you very much.
[53:39.600 --> 54:00.600]  Thank you very much.
[54:00.600 --> 54:29.600]  Thank you very much.
[54:29.600 --> 54:55.600]  Thank you very much.
[54:55.600 --> 55:24.600]  Thank you very much.
[55:24.600 --> 55:50.600]  Thank you very much.
[55:50.600 --> 56:17.600]  Thank you very much.
[56:17.600 --> 56:43.600]  Thank you very much.
[56:43.600 --> 57:11.600]  Thank you very much.
[57:11.600 --> 57:38.600]  Thank you very much.
[57:38.600 --> 58:05.600]  Thank you very much.
[58:05.600 --> 58:34.600]  Thank you very much.
[58:35.600 --> 59:02.600]  Thank you very much.
[59:02.600 --> 59:29.600]  Thank you very much.
[59:29.600 --> 59:58.600]  Thank you very much.
[59:59.600 --> 01:00:28.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:58.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:28.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:58.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:28.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:56.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:25.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:53.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:04:16.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:45.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:05:15.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:45.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:59.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:45.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:59.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:45.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:08:12.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:41.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:09:11.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:41.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:10:11.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:41.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:11:11.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:41.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:12:11.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:41.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:13:11.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:38.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:14:07.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:37.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:15:07.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:37.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:16:05.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:32.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:17:01.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:31.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:18:01.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:31.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:19:01.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:31.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:59.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:28.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:56.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:25.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:55.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:25.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:53.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:23:22.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:50.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:24:14.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:43.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:25:13.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:41.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:26:10.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:40.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:27:08.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:37.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:28:07.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:35.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:29:04.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:34.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:59.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:28.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:58.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:28.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:58.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:28.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:58.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:28.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:56.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:25.600]  Thank you very much.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:49.600]  Thank you very much.
