[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.980]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.980 --> 00:46.360]  Texas Alex Jones we are live my friends it is Monday all Hallows Eve October 31st
[00:46.360 --> 00:52.980]  2011 and we're going to be live here for at least the next three hours fresh
[00:52.980 --> 00:58.300]  out of prison for a crime he says he didn't commit and I've looked at the
[00:58.300 --> 01:04.420]  case it's clear he was framed and lawyers and others involved said it was a
[01:04.420 --> 01:08.660]  miscarriage of justice fresh out of prison he's been out for a while but
[01:08.660 --> 01:14.240]  this be the first major interview he does Fritz Springmeyer is scheduled to be
[01:14.240 --> 01:24.460]  joining us today coming up in the third hour amazing researcher prolific author
[01:24.460 --> 01:29.260]  I'll be honest with you I read some of his stuff 12 years ago or so and really
[01:29.260 --> 01:32.460]  couldn't believe it and then over the years so much of it turned out to be
[01:32.460 --> 01:38.960]  true so stuff that I read as quite frankly entertaining nightmare horror
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.500]  fiction has turned out to be accurate in many respects I haven't read all of his
[01:44.500 --> 01:49.620]  books but I've read several of them they're giant thick things we carry
[01:49.620 --> 01:58.940]  his bloodlines of the Illuminati book going into the big 13 families at
[01:58.940 --> 02:04.740]  info wars dot com and over the years he's been in prison that's been the the
[02:04.740 --> 02:13.260]  only revenue that his wife is basically had so Fritz will be joining us coming
[02:13.260 --> 02:22.300]  up in the third hour in the meantime we are going to have open phones today and
[02:22.300 --> 02:28.700]  I noticed about a week ago that the system was unable to co-opt occupy
[02:28.700 --> 02:33.980]  Wall Street they put out the call the Democratic operatives did to call out
[02:33.980 --> 02:38.500]  well-meaning people then they tried to fully co-opt it to be Obama supporters
[02:38.500 --> 02:42.500]  and to call for tax increases on the middle class that failed to a great
[02:42.500 --> 02:47.260]  extent though there are the communists and others involved it's a diverse mix
[02:47.260 --> 02:51.340]  and the in the Fedders and others have been down there educating them so now
[02:51.340 --> 02:58.140]  you notice over the weekend you saw a tax all over the United States against
[02:58.140 --> 03:03.300]  occupy Wall Street and people being taken to jail and you saw the predictable
[03:03.300 --> 03:09.100]  demonization campaigns and I heard local radio this morning demonizing the
[03:09.100 --> 03:14.900]  right of assembly and saying it was bad and also I heard the Austin police chief
[03:14.900 --> 03:20.060]  you're saying well somebody defecated in the flower bed at the city hall well
[03:20.060 --> 03:25.580]  I've talked to multiple sources and I'm gonna try to get them to go public but
[03:25.580 --> 03:30.900]  anyone being let out of the homeless shelters or homeless being arrested or
[03:30.900 --> 03:38.980]  people being let out of prison are being told by the local constabulary to go
[03:38.980 --> 03:42.740]  down to city hall and that that's the only place they're allowed to sleep at
[03:42.740 --> 03:48.260]  night and so another false flag and I'd already been told to some of the weekend
[03:48.260 --> 03:52.940]  by multiple sources and then I'm listening to local radio this morning
[03:52.940 --> 03:57.620]  local 590 with the host in their bashing occupy Wall Street just just the
[03:57.620 --> 04:05.420]  idea of protesting and I heard a very well-spoken vet call in who owns his own
[04:05.420 --> 04:09.420]  business he said a we're not all unemployed like you say be we've
[04:09.420 --> 04:12.700]  confirmed they're telling homeless who were arrested for being out drunk at
[04:12.700 --> 04:18.500]  night you won't be arrested this is the Austin Travis County jail you're
[04:18.500 --> 04:23.820]  allowed to go sleep at occupy and so they're literally sending the homeless
[04:23.820 --> 04:28.700]  people who are drunk out of their minds with a dribbling diarrhea behind them
[04:28.700 --> 04:32.420]  there and my crew's been down there that's who's down there's homeless people
[04:32.420 --> 04:36.900]  and this is happening in New York and other areas so the media can say look
[04:36.900 --> 04:43.860]  they're dirty winos and then paint the idea of protesting period as a wino
[04:43.860 --> 04:51.340]  with a bottle of Jack Daniels who's malnourished it's incredible how the
[04:51.340 --> 04:56.060]  system runs false flags the dozens arrested occupied immigration Austin
[04:56.060 --> 05:02.060]  actually it's 40 plus now we'll be right back a very wealthy US citizen is

[08:14.980 --> 08:23.100]  it is all Hallows Eve the night before all Saints Day known as Halloween or the
[08:23.100 --> 08:29.900]  devil's holiday oh of course it wasn't even a popular holiday until
[08:29.900 --> 08:36.540]  manufactured in the 1950s picking up on the druidic celebration of Shaoan or
[08:36.540 --> 08:42.460]  Sam Hain human sacrifice day that's mainline history books human sacrifice
[08:42.460 --> 08:48.740]  all over Europe throwing bound children sometimes even war leaders or chiefs
[08:48.740 --> 08:57.740]  into burning pits of flame and coals and then the establishment wanting a new
[08:57.740 --> 09:04.060]  holiday to push basically picked it and manufactured and was not popularly
[09:04.060 --> 09:12.940]  celebrated until the mid-1950s and they had songs like the monster mash it was a
[09:12.940 --> 09:18.980]  graveyard smash a monster mash so we are live ladies and gentlemen and I want to
[09:18.980 --> 09:29.180]  thank you all for joining us here today for this worldwide transmission we do
[09:29.180 --> 09:35.100]  have Fritz Springmeyer who was convicted of reportedly robbing a bank he was a
[09:35.100 --> 09:41.060]  prolific writer selling tens of thousands of books a month from what I
[09:41.060 --> 09:46.140]  know and then reportedly went out and robbed a bank and of course the evidence
[09:46.140 --> 09:54.180]  was he was completely and totally set up he'll be joining us today here on air
[09:54.180 --> 10:00.060]  and I will tell you he's lost a lot of weight I've now seen a short video of
[10:00.060 --> 10:05.580]  him this will be his first major interview and he looks like basically a
[10:05.580 --> 10:10.340]  concentration camp victim compared to the way he looked previously looks like
[10:10.340 --> 10:16.180]  he's lost about half his body weight and is frail so we should be praying for him
[10:16.180 --> 10:22.020]  and he says he's coming on though you know they could try to gin something up
[10:22.020 --> 10:27.420]  for him speaking out and throwing back in the who's cow but he is certainly not
[10:27.420 --> 10:31.220]  one to give up so we'll be talking to Fritz Springmeyer about the state of the
[10:31.220 --> 10:36.980]  world and more coming up in this important interview for much of the third
[10:36.980 --> 10:45.340]  hour today now that said we are seeing huge developments in the global economy
[10:45.340 --> 10:53.140]  right now we also have some very important franken food news dealing with
[10:53.140 --> 10:58.700]  the genetic takeover of our planet you have the whole Herman Cain scandal that
[10:58.700 --> 11:05.380]  is a complete distraction and diversion from the issues we have DHS funded
[11:05.380 --> 11:12.260]  taser drones launched in Texas they have basically the taser shotgun rounds in
[11:12.260 --> 11:17.380]  them and can taser you from a distance directly out of they live where the
[11:17.380 --> 11:22.260]  little drone flies over and rowdy Piper says hello there my little friend come
[11:22.260 --> 11:28.340]  to tell them where I am and he shoots it with a shotgun I think we're gonna do a
[11:28.340 --> 11:34.140]  bit on that tonight on the nightly news 7 o'clock central so that's coming up
[11:34.140 --> 11:41.900]  also communist occupy Pontiac Michigan and we've got a first-ever look inside
[11:41.900 --> 11:50.380]  the new red dawn that was gonna come out this year but it didn't come out this
[11:50.380 --> 11:54.940]  year because the communist Chinese got upset that's I didn't even know that I
[11:54.940 --> 12:02.020]  was I was trying to find out about the film this morning and instead discovered
[12:02.020 --> 12:06.620]  that it who knows it might not even come out next year because the communist
[12:06.620 --> 12:10.620]  Chinese got mad so they had to go in with digital computers and reportedly
[12:10.620 --> 12:15.820]  spend a whole bunch of money to take the communist Chinese symbols off things and
[12:15.820 --> 12:20.900]  put North Korean symbols on it but because North Korea is a client state
[12:20.900 --> 12:24.500]  of the chai comms that's now upsetting them and because China holds so many of
[12:24.500 --> 12:28.540]  our T bills we now can't I guess criticize them but the reason I was
[12:28.540 --> 12:35.860]  looking up red dawn this morning the new red dawn is because I saw a comment on
[12:35.860 --> 12:41.580]  one of my videos a video response to a video that had just been posted yesterday
[12:41.580 --> 12:49.180]  it only had maybe 50 views titled communist occupy Potomac or Pontiac and
[12:49.180 --> 12:57.220]  that is now up at info wars.com and it's a first look inside the film you know
[12:57.220 --> 13:02.740]  why it's a first look they haven't released trailers nothing nothing that I
[13:02.740 --> 13:07.020]  could find this is just somebody walking around in Pontiac where a whole
[13:07.020 --> 13:11.500]  area of the town where everything shut down has been turned into occupied
[13:11.500 --> 13:15.580]  America and it actually looks like something the TSA would set up so we
[13:15.580 --> 13:19.380]  have all the video of the signs you know looking for certain citizens that
[13:19.380 --> 13:22.940]  need to be picked up to see something say something a lot of the posters look
[13:22.940 --> 13:28.660]  like some of the things the communists have had at Occupy Wall Street where you
[13:28.660 --> 13:34.100]  know they're saying transfer the wealth and free market is evil so some pretty
[13:34.100 --> 13:41.900]  powerful video up at info wars.com of that titled communist occupy Pontiac the
[13:41.900 --> 13:46.820]  video below shows a set for the new version of the movie red dawn it was
[13:46.820 --> 13:52.060]  recorded on a street in Pontiac Michigan it's interesting to note that the
[13:52.060 --> 13:55.900]  posters show in the video one is reminiscent of the Occupy Wall Street
[13:55.900 --> 13:58.420]  crowd all another it looks like something the Department of Homeland
[13:58.420 --> 14:03.820]  Security might put out it says deceitful leaders greedy corporations this is not
[14:03.820 --> 14:07.860]  democracy we are here to help like that's the movie poster it says we are
[14:07.860 --> 14:13.340]  here to help with a red star it's not just like just like homeland security and
[14:13.340 --> 14:17.220]  then it also says you know don't believe the internet propaganda lies we are here
[14:17.220 --> 14:21.820]  to help sounds like Cass Sunstein at the White House and then they have images
[14:21.820 --> 14:27.700]  of the citizens by the hundreds up on placards saying dangerous citizen alert
[14:27.700 --> 14:32.100]  and it's got images of all the people that need to be picked up and arrested
[14:32.100 --> 14:36.820]  and of course it will really kill the plausibility of the film to have the
[14:36.820 --> 14:41.500]  invasion be by North Koreans who couldn't fight their way out of a wet
[14:41.500 --> 14:45.540]  paper bag instead of the communist Chinese who've really infiltrated this
[14:45.540 --> 14:49.140]  country to such a great extent have more than 5,000 front companies and have
[14:49.140 --> 14:53.060]  been caught shipping weapons in and would find a lot of Americans of the
[14:53.060 --> 14:58.620]  socialist bent that would actually aid them like the Chinese somehow invading
[14:58.620 --> 15:01.940]  this country through cover covert operations and cutting off certain
[15:01.940 --> 15:08.540]  areas of the nation is more plausible than the 1980s red dawn with the Russians
[15:08.540 --> 15:13.140]  they've got more manpower more systems and I'm not saying that's gonna happen
[15:13.140 --> 15:16.300]  either they don't need to it's the global bankers that have conquered China
[15:16.300 --> 15:20.900]  and the United States and they're playing us off against each other but
[15:20.900 --> 15:25.620]  just amazing and again we'll be covering that tonight on the nightly news
[15:25.620 --> 15:33.580]  seven o'clock central continuing with surveillance it's getting picked up in
[15:33.580 --> 15:38.860]  the British news over in the UK the Daily Mail who's listening to your calls and
[15:38.860 --> 15:42.220]  it goes on to say the Mets blanket surveillance system will track thousands
[15:42.220 --> 15:50.100]  of innocent civilians mobiles and it goes on admit that the London police and
[15:50.100 --> 15:53.140]  it goes long as the US government as well is involved the same thing as if
[15:53.140 --> 15:57.260]  that makes it okay it's just listening to people's phones and tracking them
[15:57.260 --> 16:01.740]  without warrants yes this has been going on for more than a decade and it's
[16:01.740 --> 16:08.620]  directly out of a nightmare system it's the opposite of a free society and
[16:08.620 --> 16:12.420]  and here's the central point before I get into all this news that I want to
[16:12.420 --> 16:18.580]  make to whoever you are no matter what area of the political spectrum you say
[16:18.580 --> 16:24.180]  that you sit on or perhaps you're off the reservation like I am this is the
[16:24.180 --> 16:33.340]  message you cannot doubt any angle you look at it from that the powers that be
[16:33.340 --> 16:41.220]  are moving this country and every other nation they control in a hard-core
[16:42.620 --> 16:50.020]  retrograde move towards oppression surveillance every form of known
[16:50.020 --> 16:54.980]  oppression and tyranny there is a no doubting anybody that's honest and
[16:54.980 --> 17:03.860]  there's also no doubting that when you have a Republican in office now the
[17:03.860 --> 17:08.540]  very same globalist aims are forwarded and when you get a Democrat in office
[17:08.540 --> 17:13.540]  the very same globalist programs are moved forward there's different
[17:13.540 --> 17:19.700]  rhetoric but the exact same programs are continued in lockstep whether it's
[17:19.700 --> 17:25.900]  banker the takeover bailouts or whether it's gun control moves or immigration
[17:25.900 --> 17:35.700]  policy or military policy or secret arrest or torture policy it is the exact
[17:35.700 --> 17:44.140]  same direction and that's why you see the leader of the Republican PAC Mitt
[17:44.140 --> 17:50.380]  Romney and I talked to Republicans all the time mainline Republicans I was
[17:50.380 --> 17:58.180]  talking to a former naval aviator you know F-14 pilot who's a stockbroker at
[17:58.180 --> 18:03.700]  a party I was at this weekend was at my parents party was really nice fella and
[18:03.700 --> 18:09.660]  he even listens to the show some but I brought up Mitt Romney to him he said
[18:09.660 --> 18:14.380]  yeah I like Ron Paul on some things but you know not on others but he said I said
[18:14.380 --> 18:19.580]  what about Mitt Romney I mean he's the leader and he's for open borders illegal
[18:19.580 --> 18:23.580]  alien amnesty restrictions on the second amendment he wrote the socialist
[18:23.580 --> 18:30.420]  health care plan he's for carbon taxes he's for abortion and I said why are
[18:30.420 --> 18:34.700]  Republicans supporting him and he goes well because they know he can probably
[18:34.700 --> 18:42.820]  win and you know they know they need to be basically moderate and he went on to
[18:42.820 --> 18:48.940]  say that well Mitt Romney's a politician he was doing that to win in
[18:48.940 --> 18:57.500]  Massachusetts see see there's this attitude that politicians that know how
[18:57.500 --> 19:03.020]  to change their color like a chameleon that that oh well that's why Mitt Romney
[19:03.020 --> 19:06.820]  supports gun control that's why Mitt Romney wrote the health care bill that's
[19:06.820 --> 19:10.460]  why he did this he's really a good guy he'll show those Democrats once he gets
[19:10.460 --> 19:15.620]  in power of course he didn't go that far but that was the flavor of it and it's
[19:15.620 --> 19:20.580]  they get so into the system and buying into the rules of the system and what is
[19:20.580 --> 19:26.460]  seen as strategic within the system and and regurgitating what intellectual
[19:26.460 --> 19:33.460]  pygmies in suits on the morning shows the Sunday shows tell them that that's
[19:33.460 --> 19:37.380]  the way the world needs to be people are stuck in this reservation Democrat and
[19:37.380 --> 19:42.460]  Republican no Mitt Romney didn't do that because he's a political chameleon he
[19:42.460 --> 19:47.020]  did that because that's what the big bankers want is a collectivized society
[19:47.020 --> 19:51.620]  for the general public while they're offshore exempt from it they wanted okay

[24:13.140 --> 24:19.820]  planes okay we are back alive the point I was getting to as we came to break his
[24:19.820 --> 24:28.220]  mit romney is not in the past promoting gun control open borders sanctuary
[24:28.220 --> 24:37.380]  cities carbon taxes abortion because he's doing it to be popular if you look
[24:37.380 --> 24:41.580]  at all those issues they're wildly unpopular across the political spectrum
[24:41.580 --> 24:50.700]  at around 70% conservatively they do it because that's what the ruling class
[24:50.700 --> 24:56.500]  wants that's what the ultra-rich globalist want who have all basically
[24:56.500 --> 25:01.860]  unified around destroying this country the reason we're losing our liberties
[25:01.860 --> 25:06.340]  and our freedoms is because the establishment wants to secure their
[25:06.340 --> 25:10.660]  ill-gotten gains and in the process of it when revolution comes in this country
[25:10.660 --> 25:16.180]  they're going to try to steer it into a collectivist system that will destroy
[25:16.180 --> 25:20.940]  the middle class and put regulations on what's left of the free market and shut
[25:20.940 --> 25:28.940]  it down we are at the very end of America classical domestic homeland
[25:28.940 --> 25:33.780]  security police state systems are being put in and in all the training manuals
[25:33.780 --> 25:38.780]  it is for the general public designed for the entire populace not for rogue
[25:38.780 --> 25:44.420]  terror groups that you're told there for it is right out of a textbook what they
[25:44.420 --> 25:50.900]  would set up in a Nazi Germany or a Soviet Union in occupied areas Germany
[25:50.900 --> 25:56.060]  in major population centers that were trusted was not this controlled as
[25:56.060 --> 26:03.380]  controlled as we now are occupied areas of Poland and Ukraine and Western Russia
[26:03.380 --> 26:10.580]  were areas of North Africa were areas of France that had heavy resistance I mean
[26:10.580 --> 26:16.180]  this is called an internal defense in Pentagon doctrine or when they've
[26:16.180 --> 26:20.580]  occupied a country Vietnam how to suppress the public I played you those
[26:20.580 --> 26:27.060]  internal psi-op films yesterday on air that have been declassified and you
[26:27.060 --> 26:30.940]  watch what a martial law internal defense structure is that's what the
[26:30.940 --> 26:35.940]  homeland is that's the absorption of America when you hear homeland that's
[26:35.940 --> 26:40.020]  the new America absorbing the system
[26:40.020 --> 26:45.820]  Mitt Romney would be wildly popular with the people if he was pro-gun anti-
[26:45.820 --> 26:53.500]  government-run healthcare anti-carbon tax but he doesn't care because he's
[26:53.500 --> 27:00.100]  bought and paid for by the globalist Herman Cain he's trying to sell new
[27:00.100 --> 27:06.020]  taxes as constitutional and conservative and I told you for 16 years when they
[27:06.020 --> 27:11.380]  propose the new national sales tax in VAT they're not going to get rid of the
[27:11.380 --> 27:18.540]  income tax or the payroll tax so it's really 9 9 9 9 and then they can jack
[27:18.540 --> 27:25.940]  up all the nights why do they have Bill O'Reilly
[27:25.940 --> 27:32.300]  why do they have Glen Beck Sean Hannity all of them over the years pushing well
[27:32.300 --> 27:39.740]  we got to pay off our debts cut you know cut government and raise new taxes can
[27:39.740 --> 27:45.180]  you imagine the IRS over sales taxes now they've been getting everybody ready
[27:45.180 --> 27:50.140]  for this for decades make an old lady swipe cards to buy wine or beer that's
[27:50.140 --> 27:53.820]  what this whole cashless things about is they're gonna it's gonna be graduated
[27:53.820 --> 27:59.300]  depending on your income yeah how much sales tax you pay this is all been
[27:59.300 --> 28:03.860]  actuaried out by the Rand Corporation MIT and others that's how I knew it was
[28:03.860 --> 28:07.780]  coming I've shown you the documents I've gone over here on air I know what
[28:07.780 --> 28:11.820]  their next 10 moves are and I'm sitting here in horror going hey I got their
[28:11.820 --> 28:18.300]  entire battle plan you might want to listen to me I know what's going on I
[28:18.300 --> 28:21.700]  don't know I told you nine years ago they were gonna set up checkpoints
[28:21.700 --> 28:26.180]  domestically and the TSA was gonna be the new national security force then
[28:26.180 --> 28:29.020]  Obama announced it would be a new domestic national security force
[28:29.020 --> 28:33.060]  everybody said how did you know that because and they go well it's Obama
[28:33.060 --> 28:37.180]  doing it suddenly conservatives that had supported it are suddenly against it
[28:37.180 --> 28:41.220]  because Obama made the announcement oh you watch when you get a Republican in
[28:41.220 --> 28:46.060]  they're gonna continue all this and then some and remember going back more than
[28:46.060 --> 28:51.140]  10 years before 9-11 all of the internal manuals we've been sent and that we've
[28:51.140 --> 28:54.700]  published over and over again they never started making national news till
[28:54.700 --> 28:59.300]  three years ago you go back to Rotary and other films I've got the manuals
[28:59.300 --> 29:07.260]  right there it's never about Arab or Muslim terrorists it's all flag waving
[29:07.260 --> 29:14.940]  gun owning red-blooded people who aren't communist you are the enemy the
[29:14.940 --> 29:18.900]  subversives are the people that hijacked the government and they're not
[29:18.900 --> 29:24.860]  communist the real political spectrum is communism at the grassroots to make
[29:24.860 --> 29:30.340]  you dependent but not calling it communism and then a corporate fascist
[29:30.340 --> 29:34.860]  system above it directing government to shut down all its competition that's
[29:34.860 --> 29:38.780]  what should be taught in political science classrooms and I've had them
[29:38.780 --> 29:42.660]  laugh at me for more than a decade but now it's catching on the term that I've
[29:42.660 --> 29:47.340]  always used crony capitalist is now caught on and you bankers are in

[33:34.820 --> 33:40.740]  rambler the gambler the back again just during the break I saw Newt
[33:40.740 --> 33:46.060]  Gennrich on Fox television and they had the headline under a Newt Gennrich
[33:46.060 --> 33:50.580]  gaining ground at her slow start Newt Gennrich in fact I meant to get this to
[33:50.580 --> 33:55.060]  a few weeks ago I gotta dig the book out and to go to the quotes again he wrote
[33:55.060 --> 34:03.540]  the the forward to two of the Toffler's books back in the 80s where he calls for
[34:03.540 --> 34:08.940]  the end of American sovereignty and a global government this is a guy who they
[34:08.940 --> 34:14.340]  put in there to take control of the conservative revolution in 1994 this is
[34:14.340 --> 34:21.340]  a guy who will say a lot of the right things on TV but was was was taken from
[34:21.340 --> 34:27.020]  obscurity as a Georgia professor and made the speaker of the House of
[34:27.020 --> 34:32.700]  Representatives because he is total New World Order and most people don't even
[34:32.700 --> 34:35.300]  know this
[34:35.300 --> 34:45.620]  he supported the carbon taxes Newt Gennrich has supported gun control Newt
[34:45.620 --> 34:51.020]  Gennrich has supported all sorts of horrible things and I tell conservatives
[34:51.020 --> 34:54.660]  this and they look at me like I'm a liar when they could just type into a
[34:54.660 --> 34:59.300]  search engine Newt Gennrich you know does climate commercial with Nancy
[34:59.300 --> 35:08.780]  Pelosi I mean this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with as a society and
[35:08.780 --> 35:13.940]  and and Herman Cain running around proposing new taxes and he headed up
[35:13.940 --> 35:19.140]  the Federal Reserve in Kansas City you see they're trying to muddy the waters
[35:19.140 --> 35:24.180]  here to make all of this about either you're against Wall Street which
[35:24.180 --> 35:28.540]  signifies the free market or you're against Washington the Tea Party is
[35:28.540 --> 35:32.940]  against Washington we're told and his right wing and Occupy Wall Street is
[35:32.940 --> 35:37.180]  leftist and against the free market instead we should be honest and say
[35:37.180 --> 35:42.900]  okay Wall Street is just a name of tens of thousands of companies what about
[35:42.900 --> 35:48.260]  the big mega banks that actually lobby you know let's see how Goldman Sachs and
[35:48.260 --> 35:54.340]  JP Morgan and Wells Fargo and Bank of America and Citibank how are they
[35:54.340 --> 35:58.860]  lobbying what do they give their money to and when you go look up who gives
[35:58.860 --> 36:02.180]  money to handgun control incorporated you just type in who funds handgun
[36:02.180 --> 36:07.060]  control incorporated or who funds Metro Leraza or if you type in who funds
[36:07.060 --> 36:12.540]  North American Union initiative or you type in who's funding single-payer
[36:12.540 --> 36:17.820]  health care program or if you type in who's funding every issue you can
[36:17.820 --> 36:25.380]  imagine it's the big mega banks the biggest funder across the board from
[36:25.380 --> 36:29.300]  the Nature Conservancy to the Sierra Club is Goldman Sachs their former
[36:29.300 --> 36:36.340]  presidents and vice presidents run all the groups go look it up these big so
[36:36.340 --> 36:40.380]  called free market bankers when you actually dig into it are funding the
[36:40.380 --> 36:46.140]  subversion of our basic liberties of private property of the freedom of
[36:46.140 --> 36:52.180]  mobility everything they are the ones driving our government they are the
[36:52.180 --> 36:56.780]  mega banks on record that literally in Latin America Africa Asia Middle East
[36:56.780 --> 37:01.620]  will spend decades getting their president their prime minister in former
[37:01.620 --> 37:06.740]  vice presidents of theirs literally in 50 or so countries I've looked up all the
[37:06.740 --> 37:10.820]  big ones they're taken down they they'll have the finance minister just like in
[37:10.820 --> 37:15.980]  Greece just like in Ireland just like in Iceland just like in Spain just like in
[37:15.980 --> 37:20.660]  France just like in the US and there it's literally an intelligence group it's
[37:20.660 --> 37:25.580]  a private mafia that operates with government security clearances and
[37:25.580 --> 37:30.980]  runs everything they're the ones financing taking your guns they're the
[37:30.980 --> 37:37.300]  ones financing animal ID premises ID food safety act written by Big Agra to
[37:37.300 --> 37:42.940]  shut down your farm and ranch they are a corporate Borg that leaves nothing
[37:42.940 --> 37:49.980]  unscorched it is a scorched earth policy of total domination and then they fund
[37:49.980 --> 37:56.900]  on record and come out and endorse Occupy Wall Street a month ago ad busters
[37:56.900 --> 38:01.620]  and others on record George Soros connected groups openly three months ago
[38:01.620 --> 38:05.620]  put the call out to Occupy Wall Street on the October date the early October
[38:05.620 --> 38:08.660]  date I forget the day I started what October 3rd or something well-meaning
[38:08.660 --> 38:12.980]  people here the general call is you know we just work we're tired of corruption
[38:12.980 --> 38:16.860]  of Wall Street they show up and the operative show up to try to organize
[38:16.860 --> 38:22.980]  them and control them into a group that they can now aim at what's left of
[38:22.980 --> 38:30.100]  America and play the Tea Party co-opted by Republicans off against Occupy Wall
[38:30.100 --> 38:35.460]  Street that's been co-opted and occupied by the Democrats all part of the same
[38:35.460 --> 38:39.780]  dialectic and so looking at the hands and looking at the arms look at the head
[38:39.780 --> 38:45.300]  look at the brain that's running it when you start thinking like that full
[38:45.300 --> 38:50.740]  spectrum deep analysis historical review understanding of different strategies
[38:50.740 --> 38:55.260]  that are employed against populations in the great game divide and conquer
[38:55.260 --> 39:01.940]  Balkanization divide and rule strategies stratagems by the different
[39:01.940 --> 39:07.620]  apparatchiks that are involved in this then you will suddenly see it and
[39:07.620 --> 39:13.580]  understand it and it will be so simple you're like that wasn't complex it's
[39:13.580 --> 39:16.780]  like in the 80s those paintings that came out where it was find the hidden
[39:16.780 --> 39:20.300]  image you step back and you look at it you look again and as soon as you
[39:20.300 --> 39:25.620]  relaxed you go oh it's a dolphin or it's a man's face or you know it's
[39:25.620 --> 39:34.660]  whatever as soon as you stepped back you were able to see it and it's the same
[39:34.660 --> 39:41.780]  thing here as soon as you just step back think outside the box and look and
[39:41.780 --> 39:45.820]  you'll go oh my gosh and of course everybody instinctively says oh there's
[39:45.820 --> 39:48.660]  no difference between the parties they're all controlled blah blah blah but I
[39:48.660 --> 39:54.420]  mean what does that really mean well it means if somebody real comes along like
[39:54.420 --> 39:59.300]  a Ron Paul who actually has a perfect constitutional voting record who never
[39:59.300 --> 40:04.060]  sells out who isn't a chameleon who stands out like a yellow school bus in
[40:04.060 --> 40:12.340]  the middle of a field the whole system a ignores him when they're forced to
[40:12.340 --> 40:17.380]  cover him they demonize him and say he can't win because he is a literal
[40:17.380 --> 40:23.660]  antidote to the system so if you if you go out and vote for Mitt Romney because
[40:23.660 --> 40:27.900]  you think he's the winner well you're just as stupid as the Obama supporters
[40:27.900 --> 40:32.660]  who thought he was going to fix it all but remember Mitt Romney if he wins is
[40:32.660 --> 40:38.180]  there to sell you out but as soon as he gets into office Democrats will attack
[40:38.180 --> 40:44.380]  him whatever he's doing and then you will suddenly support him in a tribal raw
[40:44.380 --> 40:48.540]  raw for your team and that's how they fool you just like Democrats support
[40:48.540 --> 40:53.540]  Obama when Republicans attack him but the Republicans will generally attack him
[40:53.540 --> 40:58.620]  for things that they were already doing themselves and at a certain point they
[40:58.620 --> 41:02.140]  really are attacking each other but they're only fighting over who gets to
[41:02.140 --> 41:07.220]  be the most powerful in those positions at the pig trough they're not actually
[41:07.220 --> 41:12.900]  fighting over intellectual issues now again I know most the audience
[41:12.900 --> 41:20.260]  understands this but I would like to hear from occupied Wall Street people
[41:20.260 --> 41:24.780]  that disagree with with me I'd like to hear from Mitt Romney supporters that
[41:24.780 --> 41:28.420]  disagree with me I'd like to hear from Herman Cain supporters I'd like to hear
[41:28.420 --> 41:33.300]  from all you Obama people they got so mad at me when I made the Obama deception
[41:33.300 --> 41:37.620]  and we're trying to boycott us and threatening us and dirty tricks and
[41:37.620 --> 41:42.500]  everything else we went through when we exposed exactly what Obama would do
[41:42.500 --> 41:47.460]  because we know what we're talking about because we're not in the dark we're not
[41:47.460 --> 41:53.300]  into being bamboozled we don't like being gamed and hustled and scammed and
[41:53.300 --> 42:00.660]  suckered and screwed and cheated and robbed and raped and laughed at we
[42:00.660 --> 42:05.180]  don't think that's funny I don't want my children growing up in a police state I
[42:05.180 --> 42:10.100]  want my private property I want my right to practice my religion or lack of it
[42:10.100 --> 42:16.180]  depending on what your view is I want my life that I want to be left alone and I
[42:16.180 --> 42:20.580]  don't want to be a slave like 90% of people in this world are living in
[42:20.580 --> 42:24.220]  countries that they call themselves somewhat free but you look at it closely
[42:24.220 --> 42:29.460]  they're not in America there's two different worlds living together at the
[42:29.460 --> 42:33.820]  same time there's the homeland that is the modern name of the new world order
[42:33.820 --> 42:42.180]  private fellow reserve occupation there's owned homeland there's this
[42:42.180 --> 42:47.980]  globalist system in America is this homeland empire or the giant Cyclops
[42:47.980 --> 42:53.420]  that the bankers trot out to dominate whenever they're going after and then
[42:53.420 --> 43:00.260]  you've got the old Republic under it and and the the homeland is dissolving the
[43:00.260 --> 43:10.420]  Republic and attacking its foundations it's absorbing it it's using it up but
[43:10.420 --> 43:15.460]  we have to run in and defend the Republic aid the Republic it's a spirit it's an
[43:15.460 --> 43:19.980]  idea it's a philosophy it's bulletproof it's a manifesto it's a
[43:19.980 --> 43:27.180]  Constitution it's a declaration of independence and so it's a spirit and
[43:27.180 --> 43:31.380]  the enemy wants to demoralize you the enemy wants you to think you don't have
[43:31.380 --> 43:35.620]  power the enemy wants you to be scared ladies and gentlemen the only thing you
[43:35.620 --> 43:42.300]  have to fear is not getting up off of your butt and resisting these people and
[43:42.300 --> 43:47.420]  it starts by going over and knocking on your neighbors doors and saying I'm
[43:47.420 --> 43:51.940]  gonna have I'm gonna show a film this Saturday night at my house and I'm gonna
[43:51.940 --> 43:55.620]  cook hamburgers for everybody you want to come over it's a political film
[43:55.620 --> 44:02.060]  that's not left or right it's about where this country stands and it could be
[44:02.060 --> 44:06.260]  in-game it could be invisible Empire with Jason Burma's it could be terror
[44:06.260 --> 44:11.380]  storm it could be fall the Republic it could be any of those films it could be
[44:11.380 --> 44:17.140]  Aaron Riosso's America freedom to fascism you want to defeat the new world
[44:17.140 --> 44:23.660]  order it starts with you literally printing up copies of the Declaration of
[44:23.660 --> 44:29.340]  Independence go into your neighbor's house and saying I want to talk to you
[44:29.340 --> 44:33.300]  and you know what you may talk to ten people till you find somebody that wants
[44:33.300 --> 44:37.260]  to talk to you but now there's two of you now you don't feel so alone when
[44:37.260 --> 44:41.260]  there's two of you knocking on doors suddenly you won't get one out of ten or
[44:41.260 --> 44:46.420]  so to join you suddenly half the people now suddenly you got 20 people coming to
[44:46.420 --> 44:52.300]  the next road starts with one ends up with two at the end of the street now by
[44:52.300 --> 44:57.060]  three streets over it's 23rd of you 20 or 30 of you knocking on doors and hey
[44:57.060 --> 45:03.300]  turn the television off night every week start picking somebody's front yard or
[45:03.300 --> 45:11.220]  backyard to have a party in and run up flags run up a don't tread on me flag
[45:11.220 --> 45:16.780]  you just start preaching the culture of liberty and people are hungry for it like
[45:16.780 --> 45:23.300]  like like a man in the desert who hadn't had water in four days people are
[45:23.300 --> 45:29.300]  hungry they are thirsty they are crying out for it and you've simply got to
[45:29.300 --> 45:35.940]  reach out to them that will defeat the globalist the whole world government is
[45:35.940 --> 45:41.620]  moving out in the open right now all of the best laid plans of mice and men
[45:41.620 --> 45:49.820]  often go awry and we knew their plan we understood their plan and for almost
[45:49.820 --> 45:54.260]  17 years I have attacked them at point-blank range you have attacked them
[45:54.260 --> 45:58.340]  for many years some have attacked them for 50 years seeing it coming as the
[45:58.340 --> 46:02.460]  globalist were building their new system and the parasite was growing the whole
[46:02.460 --> 46:06.060]  time that was its incentive to keep growing and now it's overtaking the
[46:06.060 --> 46:11.820]  Republic now that they're on top of us you ever had a bully sit on you when
[46:11.820 --> 46:15.500]  you're 10 years old sit there punch you in the face and spit on you and you
[46:15.500 --> 46:21.260]  finally get angry and throw them off of you and beat the tar out of them we're
[46:21.260 --> 46:25.660]  at the point where they're squatting on us spitting on us hissing at us with
[46:25.660 --> 46:30.020]  their big snake eyes like pinwheels trying to hypnotize this culturally
[46:30.020 --> 46:36.980]  spiritually societally and it's time to get up you're not thinking about getting
[46:36.980 --> 46:40.820]  up you're not thinking about getting these guys off your back you're not
[46:40.820 --> 46:52.860]  thinking about it you're going to do it you're going to stand up period and
[46:52.860 --> 47:03.140]  that's what it's going to take because the choice we have is no choice at all
[47:03.140 --> 47:10.380]  the alternative I mean this is not some run-of-the-mill good old boy boss hog
[47:10.380 --> 47:15.060]  corruption we're dealing with this is not just the you know no this is
[47:15.060 --> 47:24.700]  scientific but as sophisticated as this tyranny is once you're aware of it once
[47:24.700 --> 47:29.580]  you know that it isn't going to give you quarter once you know it's not going to
[47:29.580 --> 47:34.020]  give you a place in it oh yeah there's a lot of sociopaths I know out there
[47:34.020 --> 47:38.820]  listening there's this system overall doing good for you on average no it's
[47:38.820 --> 47:44.180]  not you're losing out as well you see when everybody sells out it creates a
[47:44.180 --> 47:53.300]  total hell I mean I look at all these these these clustered yuppie type
[47:53.300 --> 47:56.540]  businessmen and their perfect suits and you'll see them at dinner meetings
[47:56.540 --> 48:00.980]  talking and everything is totally calculated with a with a fake affect
[48:00.980 --> 48:05.900]  and response and it's like why are you even having dinner together it's not
[48:05.900 --> 48:14.740]  even real I mean that's got to be a prison you're in but see for those
[48:14.740 --> 48:20.540]  people building a wall like that is a shield and the truth is those are
[48:20.540 --> 48:27.580]  cowardly people we need to cultivate uprightness true intent and honor and
[48:27.580 --> 48:32.540]  directness you are nervous about knocking on your neighbor's door you're
[48:32.540 --> 48:35.860]  nervous about going and speaking at the city council you're nervous about being
[48:35.860 --> 48:45.100]  involved politically if you do it 10 20 30 40 times you will become completely
[48:45.100 --> 48:50.900]  confident and empowered and then you can go to the other extreme where you get
[48:50.900 --> 48:54.260]  like I am I can fall asleep in front of city council I can give some of the best
[48:54.260 --> 48:57.820]  speeches you've ever seen as I know some of you've witnessed because it comes
[48:57.820 --> 49:03.260]  from my heart but my problem is I do this so much I've gone to the other side
[49:03.260 --> 49:08.580]  of the spectrum where it's like breathing
[49:12.100 --> 49:18.220]  but you feel disempowered and you feel hopeless because you're not moving and
[49:18.220 --> 49:22.700]  I'm gonna tell you something you're not gonna do a perfect job the first time
[49:22.700 --> 49:29.780]  you take action or the 50th time but you are going to feel so empowered and so
[49:29.780 --> 49:37.300]  alive and you are going to build those political and intellectual muscles by
[49:37.300 --> 49:45.820]  taking action by taking the field if you never tried to learn how to row you're
[49:45.820 --> 49:48.620]  not gonna learn how to row you ever tried to learn how to play golf you're
[49:48.620 --> 49:52.980]  gonna learn how to play golf if you never try to learn how to box you're
[49:52.980 --> 49:56.140]  never gonna learn how to box if you never try to learn how to work wood or
[49:56.140 --> 50:01.660]  oil paint you're never gonna learn how if you never try to learn about how the
[50:01.660 --> 50:06.420]  world really works you're not gonna know anything and the system thinks you're
[50:06.420 --> 50:10.100]  lazy they think you're broke back they think they can run over you and listen
[50:10.100 --> 50:14.220]  a lot of people are in a total trance living in La La Land arrested
[50:14.220 --> 50:17.860]  development and you're not gonna reach them they don't count they've never
[50:17.860 --> 50:22.740]  counted it's five percent of the population on the side of good and the
[50:22.740 --> 50:29.020]  side of evil ninety percent suck in their thumb looking for somebody to lead
[50:29.020 --> 50:34.260]  them looking for somebody to help them that's a fact historically and the
[50:34.260 --> 50:39.420]  secret is of the five percent that evil's gone more than four percent of
[50:39.420 --> 50:46.220]  that or more than four fifths of it are well-meaning people in a you know in a
[50:46.220 --> 50:50.900]  brainwash template believing they're helping good by the evil when you show
[50:50.900 --> 50:54.900]  them their compartmentalization and show them how they're serving darkness you

[55:01.140 --> 55:07.380]  did that to get elected what the definition of insanity is doing the
[55:07.380 --> 55:13.460]  same thing over and over again looking for a different outcome or response the
[55:13.460 --> 55:18.620]  entire stock market is rigged on record by the mega banks for volatility up and
[55:18.620 --> 55:25.060]  down up and down so they can generate fees it's all it is so frustrating to
[55:25.060 --> 55:28.820]  see this unfolding now after I get to some of your calls and by the way the
[55:28.820 --> 55:38.020]  number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 after I get to some of your
[55:38.020 --> 55:43.060]  phone calls here today and it's not first-time callers but if you called the
[55:43.060 --> 55:46.180]  last few weeks if somebody else a chance please because we don't screen your
[55:46.180 --> 55:49.660]  calls and longtime fans kind of take advantage of it so other folks can't
[55:49.660 --> 55:58.060]  get on board 800-259-9231 coming up I mentioned some of this yesterday but the
[55:58.060 --> 56:03.100]  New York Times a Washington Times and others are reporting that Israel may go
[56:03.100 --> 56:08.860]  ahead and strike Iran and then indeed the green light is been given to Washington
[56:08.860 --> 56:13.020]  Washington's been told Israel's getting ready to strike it and here's a New York
[56:13.020 --> 56:17.860]  Times article US planning troop buildup in Gulf after exit from Iraq with an eye
[56:17.860 --> 56:24.000]  towards the threat of a belligerent Iran that's New York Times Saturday here's
[56:24.000 --> 56:31.580]  Horitz though an attack on Iran would be disastrous for Israel by Amir Oran a lot
[56:31.580 --> 56:37.420]  of the Israelis it's not one monolithic group they're saying bad idea also
[56:37.420 --> 56:44.740]  remember Bill Gates saying they want to release genetically modified mosquitoes
[56:44.740 --> 56:49.300]  to quote cure you of malaria and other things but also to forcibly give you
[56:49.300 --> 56:56.260]  vaccines see everything's moving into forced vaccines where it's in the
[56:56.260 --> 57:01.620]  pharmacological beats or the pharmacological onions where it actually
[57:01.620 --> 57:06.380]  grows the big pharma in it listen to this concerns are raised about
[57:06.380 --> 57:11.300]  genetically engineered mosquitoes New York Times and they go on to say we're
[57:11.300 --> 57:18.700]  worried because you're releasing something that can't be recalled so that's
[57:18.700 --> 57:22.460]  all coming up as well in a bunch of other news what do you think about armed
[57:22.460 --> 57:26.820]  citizen militias showing up at Occupy Phoenix well I'm all four people open
[57:26.820 --> 57:31.100]  carrying to point out the Second Amendment my issue is this group is led
[57:31.100 --> 57:37.580]  by an admitted member of the National Socialist Party or he attends their
[57:37.580 --> 57:41.780]  meetings we got video of him and and either he's an idiot or he's then a
[57:41.780 --> 57:45.260]  fed I mean I can't see it any other way I mean even if you were a white
[57:45.260 --> 57:50.660]  supremacist God forbid actually wearing Nazi uniforms as some of these people do

[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.980]  honor to talk to you well I'm looking for solutions and this is what I
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:45.940]  personally do on a daily basis um I use my cell phone and I put it on speaker
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:52.060]  phone and I have GCN programming as well as RBN programming as I'm standing and
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:57.860]  check out lanes as I am at a gas pump pumping gas and one of the ways that I
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:02.220]  get people engaged if they don't over here and pay attention I'll just simply
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:07.500]  look over and ask them do you know what your government has done to you today and
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:13.740]  it's just a matter of picking a topic that they're interested in well a lot of
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:20.140]  people will play my radio show in their business they will play this radio show
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:25.380]  or my films in their restaurant they'll have free copies at the family gas
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:29.020]  station or or they'll make copies and sell them for a dollar I don't care just
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:36.740]  get it out to people at their store or their church people will also put up
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:41.100]  little FM transmitters that cover just their neighborhood and then put up
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:46.020]  signs around the neighborhood and then stream my show off of their computer and
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:50.580]  it really has a huge effect but yes I will when my show is being rebroadcast
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:54.460]  locally sometimes I'll sit there while I'm getting gas and not turn it up super
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:58.780]  loud but turn up where folks can hear it and then I'll tell them hey you find out
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.260]  what's going on find out some key information tuned to this radio station
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:09.100]  absolutely it's having a huge effect I will agree I've had many many people
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:13.580]  stopping asking what I was listening to and I said it's the actual news it's the
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:17.540]  true news do you have business cards that are printed up with your
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:23.580]  information on it no but I have been meaning to get back there with Tim and
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:32.300]  offer basically a program of my of my bumper stickers at cost I mean
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.060]  literally at cost so people can get them there's a small profit now so folks can
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:39.860]  support us but I want to really get them out in bulk and also we should come up
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:45.420]  with a program where people just buy the business cards from us at cost so that
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:49.460]  people can you know just not even do it themselves a lot of folks have already
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:53.900]  done themselves but just activist packs we already have activist packs with
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:59.780]  bumper stickers citizen rule books info wars dot com ballpoint pens with just a
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.500]  slight profit on them but I'm thinking because the time is so short that I'm
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.820]  gonna get back there and launch something at least through Christmas where
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:11.260]  it's at cost in fact I'm glad you called in about this because this needs to be
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:16.860]  done right now I would very much like to have the business cards pass out just
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.860]  to get their initial interest what I've been doing is I've been writing it up

[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.460]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:11.620]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:15.660]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:19.540]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:23.820]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.980]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:32.300]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.500]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:39.860]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:43.180]  peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.620]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:12.420]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:19.940]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:23.500]  Alex Jones
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:33.620]  coming up in the hour your phone calls I also want to air a couple different
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:38.140]  short video slash audio pieces and I've looked at their numbers they're
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:43.180]  absolutely on target about the fact that we would need to have two point one
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:49.260]  children a piece to be able to just not have our society totally collapse but
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:55.780]  all over CNN all over MSNBC all over PBS for the last week everywhere it's
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:01.940]  there's too many people seven billion it's gonna double by 2050 when the UN
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:06.860]  zone numbers are the population's gonna plane out and stop growing at around
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:12.300]  eight and a half billion in 2024 and I've got all the numbers I'm gonna
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:17.940]  throughout the week do special reports on this here on the radio but also on the
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.620]  nightly news seven o'clock central you find it at prisonplanet.tv or
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:28.220]  m4warsnews.com but coming up at the bottom of the hour after we take some
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:32.740]  calls over population the making of a myth and two point one kids stable
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:36.100]  population and you can look these numbers up for yourself we're gonna be
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:40.740]  breaking this down and then ask why does the system want to reduce population
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:45.220]  sure some areas of the world where people have around six seven kids and are
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.940]  totally poor you could argue it's unsustainable these are people that
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:53.060]  come from agrarian societies they've been forced under UN programs off their
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:10:01.300]  land for big agra to take it over at gunpoint in Honduras in Uganda just the
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.340]  last month it's been in mainstream news that UN World Bank sponsored groups
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:10.540]  actually machine gun people that won't leave their own rural areas so they can
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:14.980]  take their land over that's why you've got people living an agrarian lifestyle
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.700]  in mega cities I'm not saying there aren't some problems in squalor but you
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:23.620]  don't keep them in squalor and then tell all the yuppies here in America and
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:28.980]  Europe don't have kids and they don't and Germany's got a 1.3 percent
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:35.020]  replacement rate for every mommy and daddy there's 1.3 children and then you
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:39.580]  add in accidents as they do in these actuaries and disease and things you're
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:47.100]  looking at one percent one person in the West this includes Japan one person is
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:52.540]  born for every two parents now that's called the death of the West as Pat
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:11:00.140]  Buchanan called it it is the total implosion the end of society that's
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:03.460]  why they've got to bring in foreigners now to just prop up the Ponzi scheme of
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:07.140]  Social Security worldwide but they've stolen all that money so it doesn't
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:11.660]  matter and then the illegals all get on welfare as you know 60% even the LA
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:16.500]  Times admits this of the people on welfare in California are illegals oh
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.140]  by the way they have jobs too they are hard-working on average but then the
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:24.300]  system gives them two three four different welfare checks under different
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:31.340]  names and of course California is going bankrupt over 70% of the people on
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:38.860]  welfare in Arizona are illegals it's over 40% in Texas we're collapsing and
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:43.900]  there's six and a half plus billion people that want to come here what six
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:48.660]  billion seven hundred million that want to come here and it would it probably
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:53.540]  wouldn't be such a problem if we had another couple hundred million come to
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:58.460]  this country but not if they get on welfare you get tens of millions of
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:02.700]  people pouring in a decade and they want welfare and Rick Perry says you
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:06.380]  don't have a big heart if you don't give the illegals in-state tuition ladies
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:10.620]  and gentlemen when my mother went to the University of Texas I think it was
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:15.140]  something like $500 a year or something now the University of Texas is
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:18.580]  something like $20,000 a year that guys look it up what's the University of
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:25.420]  Texas if you're not in-state tuition it's supposed the estate school I mean
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:29.140]  they own mostly oil in the state they're the biggest landowner here they've got
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:34.660]  $100 billion in their permanent fund billions in gold but it's it's
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:39.260]  hundreds of thousands of dollars for a degree and my tax money goes to it all
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:43.540]  day long and if and and illegal aliens can sail in here and somebody from New
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:47.820]  York or California that comes here can't get it again it's an incentive by the
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:52.260]  globalist to have taxpayers pay to bring in third-world labor to displace
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:57.540]  American jobs and you and all these stupid socialists who who who want to
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:01.420]  redistribute wealth that are at Occupy Wall Street I'm not saying all of them
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.340]  they're bad but I'm saying the socialists that are calling for it you
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:13.260]  don't have a job because of globalism is that in a year it's worse than I
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:22.220]  thought that's from the University of Texas in-state is 24,714 a year out of
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:35.020]  state is 47,426 so that's cost of attendance tuition and fees holy
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:43.500]  mackerel holy mackerel is the only word I've got well it's worse than I thought
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:49.060]  so so so there's your inflation by the way I'm not saying education's bad in the
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:55.300]  1960s if you paid 500 or so what was it in-state a thousand out of state yeah
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.940]  that was pretty much worth it even though in inflation numbers it was more
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:02.420]  like you know six seven thousand a year I've seen inflation numbers education's
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:06.060]  great but not when it costs you hundreds of thousands of dollars with
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:10.660]  interest on top and then you're a debt slave to it and they've outsourced your
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:16.300]  jobs so there's now no jobs for you that can pay back what you've put in on
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:23.540]  that all right now I'm ranting I said I go to your calls by the way I never
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:29.900]  plug this and I really should you know it's bad that I don't and I'm gonna
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:34.100]  apologize right now for this no one's complained at me it's just I was looking
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:39.700]  at the numbers that we now have this is XM serious you know on their bigger
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.300]  shows can have five six million listeners I guess there's like more than
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:49.620]  30 million total but I've seen some of the numbers that there's upwards of 200
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:55.140]  thousand people tuning in during the three hours of the show on XM and then
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:59.060]  if I plugged it this is a way for people no matter where you live or what you do
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:04.140]  God forbid you buy XM and hook it up to a pirate FM I'm just joking no matter
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:09.460]  where you are they pick up this because you know used to I did four hours so
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:12.020]  what they're doing is they were picking up the last three so really what they're
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:15.620]  picking up is the second and third live and they rear the first hour and the
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:27.260]  fourth 1 p.m. to what 4 p.m. Eastern 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern and its satellite
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:31.740]  channel 166 and I think I've been on there a couple years now for while they
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:34.620]  had me on at night and then for a year or so they've had me on there in the day
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:39.980]  and I've mentioned it some but it's almost I can't believe that that that I
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.260]  know we're competitive and get good ratings and much of what we've talked
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:47.220]  about has now come true so our credibility has risen but to be on one
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:55.020]  of their main channels 166 everybody should subscribe to XM Sirius I know
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:16:01.540]  I'm on both but this is Sirius XM so I think we're on something else on it's
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:05.900]  the same company on XM it gets confusing but the point is I've been on
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:11.340]  166 for a long time before that it was 150 something and I that's one of the
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.700]  little extra packages you can buy but most people have this I know I have it
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.940]  it's weird to sometimes not do the show and then hear my guest host to be able
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.460]  to hear it in my car by the way I love XM and Sirius you know why I love it
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:28.260]  because I can listen to TV all the channels BBC everything I can just flip
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:33.100]  to the channels and I can listen to C-span, POTUS it's it's unrivaled so
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:38.620]  all of my listeners should subscribe to Sirius XM channel 166 America's Talk
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:42.940]  they've had me on now for years so I think it's safe to subscribe now and
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:46.180]  that's something I'm gonna try to advertise on the website I'm gonna get
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:51.100]  some banners up and start linking to their subscription site because you can
[01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:54.380]  also get little portable units we have them in the house take them around with
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:58.220]  us go in the backyard or I'm in the garden with the kids boom and listen to
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:03.380]  whatever I want listen to children shows they've got books on tape yes I'm
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:06.340]  plugging the daylights out of it because they've had me on a couple years and I
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.620]  was kind of blinking at first I didn't believe my eyes or my ears but a couple
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:16.780]  years into it I'm gonna start plugging channel 166 166 and that's one
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:25.300]  o'clock to four o'clock Eastern okay so there you go my lawyer was at my parents
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:32.740]  party this weekend and he was talking about listening by the way I forgot my
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:37.900]  lawyer Eric Talb is the guy that beat the city of Austin a whole bunch now
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:41.860]  when they said that people on Congress could build a deck on their restaurant
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:47.500]  and it's even you know mainline retired Austin cop owns it nice restaurant his
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.500]  sons a firefighter works with him you know quit to work there they got the
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:57.740]  permit to build the deck and the city of Austin came in and said we're revoking
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:00.940]  it we don't care after you built a hundred thousand dollar giant deck and
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:05.180]  harassed him and Eric suit him in one and he's suing him on a bunch of other
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:09.500]  things and winning and he was talking about city people now are basically kind
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.460]  of threatening like you I know you you're a troublemaker when he's out in
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:16.420]  public and stuff they come over to him so I'm gonna try to twist my lawyer's arm
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:24.580]  to bring the owner of this restaurant in what Trudy's to to bring them in here
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:29.060]  and get them in studio just to talk about government harassment by the way
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:33.260]  now if you've got a small tree on your property they won't let you even build a
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:36.900]  high-rise building now but Eric was saying that in ins but if you're an
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:42.460]  insider or given political contributions or hire their wife or whatever to work
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:47.220]  at your company suddenly you're allowed to build total scumbag mafia and the
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:51.340]  reason I'm saying that live on air listen not only is it time for me to get
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:54.900]  Dave Mustaine on who wants to come on not only is it time to get Mike judge on

[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:41.420]  they should go watch the children of certain other cities 40 to 50,000 of
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:47.420]  them with their faces blown off riding around in pain and you know all these
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:51.860]  people that want me to go you know to Halloween events and things I can't go
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:55.580]  to some Halloween haunted house and watch people with hatchets in their heads
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:59.260]  and stuff because I think about real stuff and it's not because I'm a wimp
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:04.060]  it's because I live in the real world I don't think violence is cute
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:07.660]  absolutely I'm on the same point and you know I was gonna make that point as well
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:11.900]  imagine imagine if all the politicians all the warmongers as in if
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:16.380]  everybody saw that video we just know to be completely different society by
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:20.500]  probably next week but and that's why I wanted to bring up the Iran issue you
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:24.780]  know I'm half Iranian half American you know I'm raising a Christian upbringing
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:28.540]  for the most part my dad's a Muslim he lives in Iran and I wanted to bring up
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:33.100]  the Iran issue I know you've covered it a lot but people still don't really see
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:36.580]  it yeah I talked to people all the time I do a lot of blogging on different
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:38.820]  topics just like you and I'll link a lot of my articles to you because you got a
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:43.900]  lot of just also back towards on your website but when people are still buying
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:48.540]  into this you know Iranian want bomb Israel or whatever the media pushes and
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:51.540]  I'm doing a job that he wants to wipe Israel off the map and this is not the
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:56.260]  case people just keep buying into it even people in my own family it's hard to
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:27:00.460]  get across to them they're generalizing the entire country and they don't even
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:05.460]  realize it and obviously I'm pushing this because you see what happened in
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:09.060]  Iraq you see what happened Afghanistan what's going on in Egypt and in
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:13.820]  Libya and people are gonna buy into this and you're gonna see more little
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:17.540]  girls and little boys like that on the internet nobody's gonna talk about in
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:22.220]  the news but it's a sick that people can still buy into that crap you got Bill
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:26.540]  Riley misquoting things that the Iranian president I'm needed I'm a dinner
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:30.700]  job is saying about wanting to wipe Israel off the map and it's not it's not
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:34.060]  the case you know I'll support I'm a dinner job by all means I think it's
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:38.100]  kind of a twisted guy but you can see what they're doing obviously well he's
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:43.300]  getting in trouble right now for corruption probes and look everybody
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:47.700]  knows the president is quote allowed to run an Iran he's basically selected
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:52.900]  before it ever happens it's the Supreme Council six years ago they had very
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:58.860]  you know soft-lined folks that wanted to work with the West and truly build
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:03.140]  peaceful reactors and they were double crossed so they put hardliners in and
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:09.820]  I've seen different sociological numbers of 70 to 80% of the Persians don't like
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:13.900]  their hardline government so you know the question is Pakistan's got nukes
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:18.060]  North Korea does why can't Iran which by the way isn't even getting nukes right
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:22.580]  now but as Ron polls pointed out why have a new war with them because it
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:26.580]  becomes a political diversion and Benjamin yet Nyahu is in the Washington
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:31.420]  Times his advisors saying he thinks it'll make him look like Churchill even
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:35.180]  when his own advisors and the Mossad people that he by the way had kicked out
[01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:40.700]  are telling him don't do it don't do it because it is going to totally destabilize
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:46.820]  that whole region Israel's going to get attacked from all sides just as just as
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:52.260]  Pachennik was saying earlier here on the show last week or so or two weeks ago
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:56.940]  now it's a very very bad idea I appreciate your call but but I'm
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:29:02.140]  knowing folks in Iran I mean is that an accurate number what percentage of the
[01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:06.900]  people in Persia don't like what's going on well a majority of you got to
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:10.660]  realize that the majority of the population in Iran right now is under the age of 27
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:14.980]  and it's a very young very sophisticated population and probably the most aware as
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:19.420]  far as political issues even eugenic issues and you can talk to just about
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.900]  any Iranian they'll talk about these things just like you do every day on
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:27.180]  your show if you were to just go and talk to or ask questions to random people
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:31.660]  on the streets of Tehran or Esfahan or Shiraz just to pop in and ask what they
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:36.300]  think about the Western media saying that Iranians in general just hate
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:40.380]  Israeli Jews hate Christians that laugh at you but the stupidest thing and I'm
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:44.340]  talking about very peaceful populations just the other crowd you know my father
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:48.180]  people in the HR grew up in the revolution times you know they have a
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:53.340]  little bit of a twisted view yeah we're on the march the Empire's on the run
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:58.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:14.900]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:19.940]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:25.340]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:30.260]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:34.660]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world

[01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:14.620]  Under judgment
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:18.620]  Monday through Friday 11am to 2pm
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:23.620]  We are here, thank you so much for joining us
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:25.620]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls
[01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:29.620]  Then get into 2.1 Kids Stable Population Video
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:32.620]  Slash Audio
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:38.620]  That is put out by an organization that's done the research on this subject
[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:42.620]  I've separately literally read dozens of books on population and confirmed
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:45.620]  These numbers for my shelf
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:49.620]  You can just type into YouTube, 2.1 Kids Stable Populations
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:52.620]  In fact guys, will you just print me this with the pull down on it
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.620]  So I can actually plug the group, I've plugged them before
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:58.620]  But I can't read the organization here, thank you
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.620]  And then they've got their website that goes over it all
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:04.620]  Because we're seeing all this demonization taking place
[01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:07.620]  Against populations and people having children
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:09.620]  I wanted to go over some of those myths
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:13.620]  With all this hype of the seventh billionth person being born
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:16.620]  And then we'll play the overpopulation, the making of a myth
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:19.620]  We'll break that down as well
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:23.620]  But
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:25.620]  First we'll go to your calls, then I'll get into Prince Charles
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:30.620]  Has been offered a veto over 12 government bills since 2005
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:34.620]  How does the royalty still have vetoes over laws in England
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:37.620]  If they don't have any power like the tabloid's tell us, sir
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:40.620]  How does the Queen of England, three times the last three years
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:44.620]  Abolish Parliament in Canada because they wouldn't do what she wanted
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:48.620]  Or in Australia, she owns more than half of Canada on record
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:51.620]  This is probably the richest family in the world
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:54.620]  After the Dutch royal family, their cousins
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:57.620]  And as I covered last week, I always say they're German royals
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:00.620]  They're not even German, they're Transylvanian royalty
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:03.620]  As the BBC and others reported, Prince Charles admits
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:07.620]  That he wants to save the Transylvanian Carpathian forest
[01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:10.620]  Because he is the heir of Count Dracula
[01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:12.620]  You cannot make it up
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:15.620]  And of course they want to reduce world population by 80-90%
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:17.620]  Of course they want to shut down our resources
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.620]  I mean, it's the...
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:25.620]  500 years later, he's the progeny of Count Dracula
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:29.620]  Yeah, it's the overpopulation myth.com group
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:32.620]  And I want to get them on as guests, just amazing research
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.620]  Is it dovetails with all the research I've done
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.620]  It's very common sense research, you can do it for yourself
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:38.620]  We're going to be doing some nightly news reports
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:40.620]  Breaking it down from our own research later in the week
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:42.620]  But that's coming up after I go to some more of your calls
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.620]  Who's been holding the longest here
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:48.620]  Peter and then Matthew, Don, James and Rick and others
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.620]  But before I go any further, I have not really been hyping this
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:55.620]  But it has been a big success in that a lot of folks are signing up

[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:17.620]  That has 150 million views on it
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.620]  And so you're also then financing us reaching tens of millions there
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:24.620]  And the hundreds of other video channels that copy it as well
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:31.620]  And I haven't even gotten ready yet to put the nightly news on different cable and TV systems that want it
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:33.620]  There's going to be more a la carte here and there
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:34.620]  But we've had a lot of people reach out to us
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:37.620]  I'm told there's already systems all over the country airing it
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:39.620]  As we're getting the calls and emails about it
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:43.620]  And I've run into folks in Houston who own a cable channel that have put it on
[01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:46.620]  I need to actually get in contact with them and create a whole listing
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:49.620]  We're moving so fast, we don't even know everywhere we're on yet
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:52.620]  People that are already grabbing this thing live, which is pretty crazy
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:54.620]  Because sometimes it has glitches and stuff live now
[01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:56.620]  That's why we're beta testing
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.620]  We haven't gotten all the kinks ironed out
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.620]  But whatever, it's exciting
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:01.620]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:02.620]  Go to the Sound of the Guns
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:05.620]  15-day free trial, PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:09.620]  And speaking of not screwing around
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:13.620]  I had the idea to offer our bumper stickers
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.620]  Not at a small profit, but at no profit
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:21.620]  We have a 15 bumper sticker pack with different selections
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:26.620]  For $3.95, it was $6.95
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.620]  So now it's half off
[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:31.620]  $3.95 instead of $6.95
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.620]  And that includes Citizen Rollbook and some other stuff
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:37.620]  Or it'd be even less, because that thing costs us about $0.55
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:42.620]  Then we have a 25 variety pack, it's $5.95, it was $9.95
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:47.620]  We have a 50 pack, it's now $9.95 instead of $14.95
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:51.620]  We have a 100 pack, $17.95 instead of $24.95
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.620]  And by the way, to even get the prices down to this
[01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:55.620]  We're going to sell out quick
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.620]  I just ordered 20,000 of each type of bumper sticker
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:00.620]  As soon as I gave the order to do this
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:03.620]  They said we got to order then 20,000 of each
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:05.620]  Because we'll run out quick, it takes two weeks to get them
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:09.620]  And I just had to order 20,000 more Citizen Rollbooks
[01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:14.620]  Get them, let's have a major offensive with the bumper stickers in legal and lawful areas
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:19.620]  Certainly don't stick these on Homeland Security billboards
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:22.620]  Saying, spy on your neighbor, on Soviet takeover billboards
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:26.620]  People in Germany I guess shouldn't have stuck stickers up against Hitler either
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.620]  But I'm being sarcastic there folks
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:31.620]  The point is, bumper stickers, everything
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:36.620]  This is at cost, at cost, at cost, at cost, at cost, at cost
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:39.620]  We factored it all in, at cost
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:41.620]  Our shipping, our handling, all of it
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:44.620]  It's available right now, infowars.com
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.620]  I'm already seeing my bumper stickers everywhere
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.620]  Let's blitz them hard
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:50.620]  Prisonplanet.tv
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:52.620]  That's one way to support us to get the word out

[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.620]  On any subject you can imagine that you think's important
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:58.620]  Get it out to people
[01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:02.620]  And now in the bumper sticker, infowars, activism area
[01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:04.620]  Everything being slashed down to nothing
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:07.620]  Because I'm all in, I'm all in, all in
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:09.620]  Let's hit them, let's hit them hard
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:12.620]  By the way, I've got to finish watching the final videos that came in
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.620]  I've pushed back the contest a while
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.620]  Cause we've been, we've bitten off more Winged Shoe
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.620]  But I will finish up looking at the videos and choosing the winner
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:23.620]  And we'll announce those by during, sometime during the money bomb
[01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:26.620]  We'll play first, second and third place for the Alex Jones prediction videos
[01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.620]  Here on air during the money bomb
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.620]  So let's mark that down, Sharon
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.620]  And we will get that in
[01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.620]  Much the time we just have producer meetings
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:36.620]  Here live on air
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:38.620]  So that is coming up
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.620]  Let's go to your calls now, enough of that
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:44.620]  Let's talk to Matthew in California, you're on the air, go ahead
[01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:47.620]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to say first of all
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:50.620]  Thank you for waking me up
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:52.620]  I've been a mega death fan
[01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:54.620]  Speaking of Dave Mustaine for
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:56.620]  Ever since I can remember
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:59.620]  And it wasn't until his last album endgame
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:03.620]  That I really started to wake up and then I watched your movie
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.620]  Endgame
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:08.620]  And I took up the fight
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:12.620]  Back in the early part of June here in 2011
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:15.620]  Cause basically
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:18.620]  A light switched in my head
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:21.620]  A light went off and
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:23.620]  I have two kids and
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:25.620]  Seven and six year old
[01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:29.620]  And both of them have been affected by vaccines
[01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:33.620]  I see vaccines
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:38.620]  The negative effects in everything about vaccines
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.620]  And so that's how I first started
[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:44.620]  I got awake but
[01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:47.620]  What I really wanted to tell you is
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.620]  Well
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:51.620]  Kind of lost my train of thought here for a second
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:53.620]  But first of all like I said
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.620]  Thank you for waking me up
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:58.620]  I really appreciate everything that you do
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:01.620]  And everything that you do
[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:05.620]  And the fight that you've undertaken for all of us
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:07.620]  I know what I wanted to say now
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:11.620]  I wanted to say back to your first caller Blue
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:13.620]  She made a really good point
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:16.620]  I made an order a few months ago
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:19.620]  From you guys and I got a bunch of the bumper stickers
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:21.620]  And ever since I got those bumper stickers Alex
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:23.620]  All I can tell you is that
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:27.620]  I've had more conversations with people about meaningful things
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:28.620]  Than ever before
[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.620]  Oh that was a point I never make enough
[01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:32.620]  Because I'm not just saying this
[01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:35.620]  All these people say they want to meet like-minded awake people
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:37.620]  You wear an infowars.com shirt
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:39.620]  Or a Ron Paul shirt
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:41.620]  The shirts we sell are an in the fed shirt
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.620]  Or a socialism is stealing shirt
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:47.620]  Where it shows the guy with the gun putting
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.620]  The gun to the head taking the guy's money
[01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.620]  And it says socialism
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:53.620]  You will meet real Americans everywhere
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:56.620]  You put an infowars.com bumper sticker on your car
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:59.620]  You will meet like-minded people
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:01.620]  And it's weird you might have a cop
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:04.620]  Pull you over for speeding and let you off
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:05.620]  Because you have the sticker
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:08.620]  You might also have cops pull you over because of it
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:10.620]  We've had both happen
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.620]  But you'll really find out who people are
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:15.620]  And what side they're on with an infowars bumper sticker
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:16.620]  I appreciate your call
[01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:18.620]  It is incredible
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:21.620]  I mean when I wear my shirt out in public
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:23.620]  Liberty or death or in the fed
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:25.620]  I run into people who don't even know who I am
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:27.620]  I also run into folks who obviously listen to the show
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:28.620]  Or watch it online
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:30.620]  But I run into people who are like
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:32.620]  Oh I like your shirt you know don't try it on me
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:34.620]  What are you in the tea party?
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:36.620]  I'm like yeah we're the folks who started the tea party
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.620]  Before the main line Republicans
[01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:40.620]  Try to take it over
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:41.620]  Let's go to Peter in Washington
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:43.620]  Peter you're on the air
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:47.620]  Hello Alex there's a couple of points I'd like to bring up
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:50.620]  The first one is easy
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:52.620]  And the other one is not so easy
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:55.620]  The easy one is I'm inclined to agree with you
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:57.620]  About Mitt Romney
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:01.620]  However I would like to see Mr. Scalzen
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:05.620]  Try to make a defense of him if he will
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:07.620]  Now the second point is
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.620]  What is Scalzen?
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:10.620]  Joel Scalzen likes him?
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:15.620]  Well he said a little bit
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:18.620]  Well I've heard him say Romney doesn't know what he's doing
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:20.620]  And I don't agree with that
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:23.620]  But you know Joel's a good guy he speaks with authority
[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:27.620]  You know that I heard him one night on coast to coast say
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:30.620]  That I was incorrect about the super congress
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:33.620]  But all these other people Ron Paul and others have said
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:35.620]  That he can't find it in the constitution
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:37.620]  This super congress is different
[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:41.620]  They've had to you know have congress people like Boehner come out and say
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:44.620]  Look they bring up the spending bill now
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:46.620]  That's unconstitutional
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.620]  The House can vote up or down on it
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:51.620]  That's not how spending bills are supposed to operate
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:53.620]  That's unconstitutional in my view
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:55.620]  And I've looked at other super committees
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:57.620]  This one has taken even more power
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:59.620]  But you know I should get Joel on
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:02.620]  Maybe during the 24 hour broadcast or something
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.620]  So we can discuss that
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:08.620]  Okay now here's the hard point
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:11.620]  About 10 or 15 years ago
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:17.620]  In various times I read some of the LaRouche material
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:22.620]  And after reading it I concluded that it could be
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:25.620]  A crypto-Jesuit operation
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.620]  It's very anti-Protestant
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:31.620]  It's in various other things
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:40.620]  Dogmatic Platonism and anti-empirical and other things
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:43.620]  I know probably other people have talked about it
[01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:44.620]  Well I'll say this
[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:48.620]  I don't know about Jesuit operations or something in there
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:52.620]  But I mean a lot of philosophy and systems
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.620]  Have been charted by the Jesuits
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:56.620]  The word propaganda came from the Jesuits
[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:59.620]  So you're right on that front
[01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:02.620]  But I mean as for LaRouche group
[01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.620]  You see I have Democrats on
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:07.620]  I have Republicans on
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:09.620]  I have Naomi Wolf on
[01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:11.620]  And I don't agree with her politics
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:13.620]  To get her perspective
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.620]  So just because I have a group on
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:18.620]  Doesn't mean that I subscribe to everything they say
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:19.620]  Or everything they believe in
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:20.620]  I've had Pat Buchanan on
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:22.620]  Doesn't mean I agree with him on everything
[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:24.620]  I've had liberals on
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:25.620]  Conservatives on
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:27.620]  I've had just you name it
[01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:28.620]  I've had them on
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:31.620]  And so I had David de Rothschild on
[01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:33.620]  And attacked him for pushing carbon taxes
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:35.620]  And people said look he got a Rothschild on
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:38.620]  My gosh he must be incredibly connected
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:40.620]  No he had a book coming out
[01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.620]  And we called the publisher
[01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:44.620]  Greedy to get their person booked on
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:45.620]  A hundred shows
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:47.620]  We called the publishers
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:49.620]  I don't want to tell people how to do a radio show
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:51.620]  But people who don't work in radio just don't know this
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:54.620]  You can get famous people on when they got a book out
[01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:55.620]  And so our powerful people
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:58.620]  And that's how we got Rothschild on
[01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.620]  The head of the Kissinger group
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:01.620]  He had super class out
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:02.620]  He wanted to sell a bunch of it
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:04.620]  We called and got him on
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:06.620]  People were like how did he get Rothschild on
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:07.620]  We dialed the telephone
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:08.620]  That's how we did it
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:10.620]  And he thought I was Alex S. Jones though
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:12.620]  But by the first break he was like
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:14.620]  Oh yeah I thought you were Alex S. Jones
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:16.620]  Well I'll finish the interview
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:20.620]  So the point is that
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:24.620]  I don't agree with a lot of the solutions
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:26.620]  Of things that Lenin LaRouche pushes
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.620]  His analysis of the Anglo-American
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:30.620]  Banking establishment
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:31.620]  And things like that
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:32.620]  I think is
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:34.620]  Look I read stuff they wrote
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:37.620]  20 years ago
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:38.620]  I swear I read it 16 years ago
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.620]  Or so after I had already kind of woken up
[01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:41.620]  And I was really searching
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.620]  That later I separately discovered to be true
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:46.620]  In original research
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:49.620]  So I think they got some of the best research out there
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.620]  LaRouche when I called 16 years ago
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.620]  To get their quote free magazine
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:54.620]  Very pushy
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:56.620]  When I wanted to call and get it
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:58.620]  For the free thing
[01:48:58.620 --> 01:48:59.620]  All this stuff
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:01.620]  I didn't like that
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:03.620]  So it's a separate issue
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:05.620]  From where I stand
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:06.620]  And what I do
[01:49:06.620 --> 01:49:08.620]  And I've always said that
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:09.620]  When I get LaRouche on
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:10.620]  Go ahead
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:14.620]  Well okay Alex
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:17.620]  And like you say
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:20.620]  You are a
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:23.620]  You're playing a chess game on several levels
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:26.620]  Just don't lose track
[01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:28.620]  Is all I say
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:30.620]  And I appreciate you a lot
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:31.620]  Thank you
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:33.620]  Well I appreciate you
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:34.620]  Look
[01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:36.620]  My greatest frustration is
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.620]  I don't have time to craft my message
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:43.620]  I don't have time to really get it all right
[01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:46.620]  And be perfect about it
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:48.620]  I'm just up here swinging
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:50.620]  Because I've calculated that
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:52.620]  If I just do the basic research
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:54.620]  And overall let it all hang out
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:56.620]  I can reach more people and get more done
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:00.620]  I am capable of making super high powered films
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:04.620]  That reach 20, 30, 40 million a piece
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:06.620]  People-wise
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:08.620]  That we put out for free
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:13.620]  That do cause giant sea changes
[01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:18.620]  And it is a
[01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:20.620]  I could
[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:21.620]  I've really thought about this a lot
[01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:24.620]  I could probably reach
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:26.620]  As many people as I'm reaching now
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.620]  And be totally pure
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:30.620]  And make films
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:32.620]  And just release a film every 2, 3 months
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:35.620]  And have about 5 employees
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:37.620]  Instead of 30 something
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:42.620]  But now I've got all this crew
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:43.620]  I've got this model
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:45.620]  A lot of it's to keep this crew hired
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:47.620]  And also I like to talk a lot
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:49.620]  So it's a lot of
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:50.620]  But I have thought about
[01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:52.620]  Really just making films
[01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:54.620]  But then I wouldn't have my defense
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:55.620]  Of being on the radio live
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:56.620]  In the big audience
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:59.620]  So it's a catch 22
[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:28.620]  Choose from a wide variety
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:29.620]  Of our new American made
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:31.620]  Vapriate e-liquid flavors

[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:50.620]  An addictive substance

[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:53.620]  To cause birth defects or cancer
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:54.620]  Please be aware of the risks
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:56.620]  Associated with e-cigs prior to use
[01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:59.620]  You must be 18 years or older to purchase
[01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:02.620]  You can bet your life on e-foods direct

[01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:09.620]  And how a food savings account
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:12.620]  Is your best insurance against natural disasters
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:14.620]  Job loss and high food costs
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:16.620]  But did you know that this dehydrated food
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:19.620]  Also protects you against food born contaminants
[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:22.620]  Like e-coli and salmonella
[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:24.620]  Those poisonous critters can't live
[01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:26.620]  In low moisture food from e-foods direct
[01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:28.620]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special

[01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:02.620]  Our rights as individuals
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:04.620]  To freely purchase dietary supplements
[01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:06.620]  Over the counter are under constant attack
[01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:08.620]  The globalists want to ban all supplements
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:10.620]  Formulated after 1994
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:12.620]  Governments are hoarding raw materials
[01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:14.620]  Affecting our ability to purchase
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:16.620]  These products at a reasonable price
[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.620]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:20.620]  Due to overuse of soil
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:22.620]  And compromised growing conditions
[01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:24.620]  Storeable foods are essential
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:26.620]  But you also need to make sure
[01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:28.620]  You have the nutrients you need to stay healthy
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:29.620]  During emergencies
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:31.620]  Go to survivalrx.com today
[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:33.620]  And see the amazing line

[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.620]  The owners of survivalrx.com
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:42.620]  Have been in sports nutrition for over a decade
[01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:44.620]  And they realize the need
[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:46.620]  For long term storeable vitamins
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:48.620]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method
[01:53:48.620 --> 01:53:50.620]  Which allows these vitamins
[01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:52.620]  To maintain their strength for decades
[01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:55.620]  Again, go to survivalrx.com
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:54:19.620]  At survivalrx.com
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:23.620]  There must be some kind of way out of here
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:27.620]  Set a joke up to the theme
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:29.620]  There's too much to do
[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:31.620]  Okay, there are reportedly 7 billion people
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:32.620]  On this earth
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:34.620]  If you go to the UN's own numbers
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:36.620]  I'm going to do more detailed reports
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.620]  Showing this later in the week
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:39.620]  On the nightly news
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:41.620]  I'll probably air it here as well
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:44.620]  The UN says 8.4, 8.6
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:48.620]  It varies by about 2024, 2025
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.620]  And then population starts going down
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:53.620]  And that's as a whole worldwide
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:54.620]  In the United States
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:57.620]  We have a 1.4% replacement rate
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.620]  If it wasn't for all the immigrants coming in
[01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:01.620]  Our population would be dropping
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:03.620]  Europe, Japan, Japan has what a 1.2
[01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:05.620]  Italy a 1.2
[01:55:05.620 --> 01:55:07.620]  For every, and then you count in
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:08.620]  Automobile accidents
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:11.620]  People that don't have kids
[01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:14.620]  People dying, young
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:17.620]  For every two adults that were born
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:20.620]  On average there's one person to replace them
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:21.620]  So you do the math
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:22.620]  There's nobody to pay the Social Security
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:24.620]  There's nobody to upkeep the society
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:26.620]  These are dying cultures
[01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:28.620]  Especially when the third world's exploding
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.620]  And most of this population control
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:33.620]  Is only happening with the higher educated people
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:36.620]  That's what Mike Judge covers in Idiocracy
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:37.620]  It shows the smart folks going
[01:55:37.620 --> 01:55:39.620]  We're not going to have kids for the earth
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:40.620]  And then it shows the football player
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:41.620]  Who's mindless going
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:43.620]  I'm going to have sex with all of you
[01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:45.620]  With like 10 cheerleaders around you
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:47.620]  And that's basically what's happened
[01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:50.620]  So let's go to 2.1 kids
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:53.620]  Stable population
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:57.620]  And then we'll get, which one is first?
[01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:03.620]  Which one did I queue up first?
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:05.620]  Okay, so this is the first one
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:08.620]  The 2.1 kids, stable population
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:11.620]  Here it is
[01:56:11.620 --> 01:56:13.620]  And it starts with video
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:16.620]  And it says 2.1 kids, a stable population
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:17.620]  From the time of the cavemen
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:19.620]  All the way until today
[01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:20.620]  Humanity continues to exist
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:21.620]  Because each generation of people
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:24.620]  Has produced another generation to replace itself
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:25.620]  Scientists have figured out
[01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:26.620]  How many people need to be born
[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:29.620]  Each generation to replace the generation before
[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:32.620]  That number is one person per person
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:33.620]  All things being equal
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:36.620]  This creates perfect demographic balance
[01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:37.620]  Since women are the only ones
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:38.620]  Who can have children
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:40.620]  Replacing every person on earth
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:42.620]  Means each woman needs to have two children
[01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:43.620]  One to replace her
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:45.620]  And the other to replace the man
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:47.620]  Who cannot have children
[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:48.620]  The total fertility rate
[01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:49.620]  Is the average number of children
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:51.620]  Each woman in a society is having
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:52.620]  This number shows us
[01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:55.620]  If a society is growing or shrinking
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:56.620]  In developed countries
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:57.620]  The replacement rate birth rate
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:57:00.620]  Is 2.1 children per woman
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:02.620]  This will keep the population stable
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:03.620]  But even that is assuming
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:05.620]  That every woman has children
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:07.620]  And that there are no wars, famines
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:09.620]  Or disease
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:10.620]  In the real world
[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:11.620]  Disasters happen all the time
[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:14.620]  And sadly not all children reach adulthood
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:15.620]  Especially in poor countries
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:17.620]  This pushes their replacement rate
[01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:19.620]  Up to 3.3 children per woman
[01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:21.620]  Since not every woman wants to have children
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:23.620]  In order to keep the population stable
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.620]  Some women need to have more than 2.1 children
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:26.620]  To balance the birth rate
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:28.620]  With the women who are only having one
[01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:29.620]  Or no children at all
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:31.620]  Maintaining this balance
[01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:32.620]  Is of the utmost importance
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:35.620]  If society does not at least replace itself
[01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:36.620]  Every generation
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:38.620]  Human numbers begin to fall exponentially
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:40.620]  Economic and social problems appear
[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.620]  As elderly people retiring
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:43.620]  Begin to outnumber young people
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.620]  Entering the workplace
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:46.620]  This is already happening
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:48.620]  All over the developed world
[01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:49.620]  Many of the world's nations
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:51.620]  Are only barely replacing themselves
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:52.620]  While a growing majority
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:54.620]  Have birth rates below replacement
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:56.620]  Some as low as 1.8
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:59.620]  Or even 1.2 babies per woman
[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:00.620]  Many societies
[01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:02.620]  Are facing a very real danger
[01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:04.620]  Extinction
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:06.620]  Okay, folks
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:08.620]  And if you can't watch the graphics
[01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:10.620]  It's a lot stronger when you watch them
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:11.620]  I'm going to have the crew
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:13.620]  Repost it up at infowars.com
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:15.620]  We're going to come back and play the rest
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:16.620]  And we have Fritz Springmark joining us
[01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:18.620]  But my wife and Whole Foods
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:19.620]  With three children
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:21.620]  Has actually had women come over
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.620]  And get in her face
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:25.620]  Listen, the West is dying
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:27.620]  The numbers they show in that video
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:29.620]  Is the West with the immigrant population
[01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:30.620]  Coming in
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:32.620]  You remove them from the community
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:34.620]  And the population coming in
[01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:36.620]  You remove that, it's even lower
[01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:38.620]  Okay, so the West is dying
[01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:40.620]  Get it through your head
[01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:44.620]  You are listening to GCN
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:47.620]  Visit GCNLive.com today
[01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:54.620]  Alex Jones here with vital information
[01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:56.620]  Concerning our nation's fragile food supply
[01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:59.620]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming
[01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:01.620]  And I think it's important for my listeners
[01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:03.620]  To learn three things right away
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:05.620]  Number one, study the past
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:07.620]  History really does repeat itself
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:09.620]  Number two, learn to spot
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:12.620]  The dangerous food shortage trends
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:15.620]  Number three, take decisive action
[01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:17.620]  A perfect storm is brewing
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:19.620]  Or a global food crisis
[01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:21.620]  That's why I'm telling everyone
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:24.620]  To read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:26.620]  Warning signs that trigger
[01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:28.620]  The deadliest famines in history
[01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:30.620]  Don't get caught unprepared
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:32.620]  When the crisis hits
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:34.620]  This book is only available
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:36.620]  At RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com
[01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:39.620]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:41.620]  How to cut your grocery bills in half
[01:59:41.620 --> 01:59:43.620]  Again, that website is
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:46.620]  RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com
[01:59:46.620 --> 02:00:00.620]  RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com
[02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:20.620]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:22.620]  Alex Jones
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:34.620]  Okay, let's go to one more of these videos
[02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:36.620]  And again, I'm going to do a more detailed report
[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:38.620]  Later in the week
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:41.620]  This is the overpopulation, the making of a myth
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:43.620]  The reason I'm playing this
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:45.620]  I had a Morrier calls and Fritz Springmeyer
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:47.620]  Which is they just keep hyping
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:49.620]  We're overpopulated
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:51.620]  Well, not in the west
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:53.620]  And I understand there's a globalist loathing
[02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:55.620]  A self-loathing going on in the west
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:57.620]  But literally
[02:00:57.620 --> 02:00:59.620]  People will come up to you at parks
[02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:01.620]  In grocery stores here in trendy Austin
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:03.620]  And they'll say, wow, you got too many kids
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:05.620]  That's bad for the earth and people
[02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:07.620]  You're supposed to step and fetch
[02:01:07.620 --> 02:01:09.620]  And I bought carbon credits from Al Gore
[02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:11.620]  The fat slob
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:13.620]  No, it's like, get out of my face, you little control freak
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:15.620]  You chose not to have kids
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:17.620]  Because you're so self-loathing
[02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:19.620]  Get away from me
[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:21.620]  It's incredible
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:23.620]  You know, you can fit everybody in the world
[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:25.620]  And they have an acre or so into Texas
[02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:27.620]  Certainly, there are some areas of the world
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:29.620]  Where I would say things are overpopulated
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:31.620]  But humans are like reef fish
[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:33.620]  We like to stay in congregations
[02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:35.620]  That's why everything gets in compact areas
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:37.620]  And there certainly are some toxic systems out there
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:39.620]  But the globalist lecture us all day
[02:01:39.620 --> 02:01:41.620]  When they're coming out with genetic engineering
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:43.620]  And cross-species splicing
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:45.620]  I agree with John Lennon when he said
[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:47.620]  Overpopulation is a myth and a fraud
[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:49.620]  And it's planing out right now
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:51.620]  At 8.5 billion
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:53.620]  We just hit 7 billion
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:55.620]  It's setting all the actuaries to plane out
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:57.620]  At 8.5 billion
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:01:59.620]  They've had those projections for 20 years
[02:01:59.620 --> 02:02:01.620]  And they've shown to be very accurate
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:03.620]  Because the globalists are reducing people
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:05.620]  They should know
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:07.620]  They're reducing the climb rate
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:09.620]  And then the trajectory goes down
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:11.620]  And then of course
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:13.620]  They're releasing genetically modified mosquitoes
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:15.620]  I've got that in the New York Times
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:17.620]  That's all coming up as well
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:19.620]  But right now, I want to go to this video
[02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:21.620]  Here is overpopulation, the making of a myth
[02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:27.620]  Population 101, overpopulation
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:41.620]  The making of a myth
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:43.620]  He sat down and did some simple math
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:47.620]  And summarily decided that the world would be out of food by 1890
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:49.620]  He blamed reduced mortality rates
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:51.620]  And recommended killing off the have-nots of society
[02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:53.620]  Lest the haves starve to death
[02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:55.620]  This cry was taken up by Paul Ehrlich
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:57.620]  Of Stanford University in 1968
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.620]  Who claimed that reckless human reproduction
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:01.620]  Had overwhelmed the earth
[02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:03.620]  Massive famines would result
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:05.620]  Which would destroy, best case scenario
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:07.620]  One-fifth of humanity by the end of the 70s
[02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:09.620]  And the planet would follow
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:11.620]  This fear produced large donations
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:13.620]  For the newly created UNFPA
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:15.620]  Which thrives on an imagined crisis
[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:17.620]  That has been both imminent and rescheduled
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:19.620]  Again and again over the past two centuries
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:21.620]  The truth of the matter is that
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:23.620]  Every family on this planet
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:25.620]  Could have a house, with a yard
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:27.620]  And all live together on a landmass
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:29.620]  The size of Texas
[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:31.620]  Which is really just a small corner of the planet
[02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:33.620]  The population of earth will peak in 30 years
[02:03:33.620 --> 02:03:35.620]  And then start to go back down
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:37.620]  We're not overpopulated
[02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:39.620]  Through the math
[02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:43.620]  And by the way
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:45.620]  That is the facts
[02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:47.620]  2025 or so
[02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:49.620]  It peaks, then begins to fall
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:51.620]  And then the big troubles happen
[02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:53.620]  Because who's going to take care of this
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:55.620]  Giant aging population
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:57.620]  The answer is explore space
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:59.620]  The answer is build ocean cities
[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:01.620]  Which they have the technology for
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:03.620]  The answer is come out with cleaner technologies
[02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:05.620]  But the globalists
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:07.620]  Want to self-manifest this
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:09.620]  That's what this whole carbon tax is
[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:11.620]  Is a forced
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:13.620]  Post-industrial world
[02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:15.620]  That's what ethanol is
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:17.620]  Starving tens of millions a year
[02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:19.620]  Conservatively killing an extra 10 million people
[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:21.620]  It's gone from 15 million a year
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.620]  Starving to over 25 million
[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:25.620]  This is what's happening
[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:27.620]  This is what's going on
[02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:29.620]  This is the shutdown of society
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:33.620]  Because the elites for hundreds of years
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:35.620]  Since Malthus have believed in this
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:37.620]  And liked the idea that they're superior
[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:39.620]  Royalties always thought that
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:41.620]  No matter what culture or group
[02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:43.620]  So that's why when eugenics came out
[02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:45.620]  Through Galton out of Malthus
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:47.620]  And then
[02:04:47.620 --> 02:04:49.620]  Everyone and others
[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:51.620]  This is their world view
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:53.620]  That's why they do all of this
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:55.620]  And they've set up a whole world
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:57.620]  According to this system
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:04:59.620]  And it just continues
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:01.620]  And it's now the stealth system
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:03.620]  Running our planet is where Hitler came from
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:05.620]  A very wealthy US citizen
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:07.620]  Is predicting that in 2011
[02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:09.620]  We will witness the most important day
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:11.620]  In America in more than 50 years
[02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:13.620]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:15.620]  The way you shop, travel, invest
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:17.620]  Health and your own family
[02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:19.620]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:21.620]  The crazy part is
[02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:23.620]  He's usually right
[02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:25.620]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM
[02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:27.620]  Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner
[02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:29.620]  General growth properties
[02:05:29.620 --> 02:05:31.620]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:33.620]  Recently he created a video
[02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:35.620]  Which you can watch online for free
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:37.620]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:39.620]  And it's a real eye-opener
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:41.620]  I can't stress this enough
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:43.620]  You should at least watch this free video online today

[02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:05.620]  The grim future foretold in 1984
[02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:07.620]  Has become reality
[02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:09.620]  It really says that the state is God
[02:07:09.620 --> 02:07:11.620]  The United States has now recognized
[02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:13.620]  Globally as one of the most
[02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:15.620]  Impressive police states on Earth
[02:07:15.620 --> 02:07:17.620]  This film conclusively proves
[02:07:17.620 --> 02:07:19.620]  The existence of a secret network
[02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:21.620]  Of FEMA cams
[02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:23.620]  Now being expanded nationwide
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:25.620]  This documentary exposes how
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:27.620]  The continuity of government program
[02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:29.620]  Has established an old powerful
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:31.620]  Shadow state
[02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:33.620]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening
[02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:35.620]  Depths to which our republic has fallen
[02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:37.620]  Enter the secret of world
[02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:39.620]  Of emergency dictatorship
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:41.620]  Body scammers, sound cameras
[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:43.620]  Citizen spies, staged terror
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:45.620]  And cameras on every street corner
[02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:47.620]  It's only the beginning of the
[02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:49.620]  New World Order's hellish plan
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:51.620]  The police state isn't coming

[02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:03.620]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:05.620]  Deep behind enemy lines
[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:07.620]  The information war continues
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:09.620]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:17.620]  Well, there's a lot of disinformation
[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:19.620]  Out there about him
[02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:21.620]  I've met him in person several times
[02:08:21.620 --> 02:08:23.620]  And found him to be
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:25.620]  A very genteel, nice person
[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:29.620]  I didn't get any bad vibes from him
[02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:31.620]  And I know that that's always
[02:08:31.620 --> 02:08:33.620]  The real signal
[02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:35.620]  And I've been selling his book now
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:37.620]  For many years, Bloodlines of the Illuminati
[02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:39.620]  Fritz Springmeyer, one of the only places
[02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:41.620]  You can actually get it, is at infowars.com
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:43.620]  And when I first read this
[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:45.620]  A decade ago or so
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:47.620]  I'm going to be frank with you
[02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:49.620]  I met Fritz when he was here in Austin
[02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:51.620]  On local TV
[02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:53.620]  Down at the station
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:55.620]  And met him at another conference event once
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:57.620]  And
[02:08:57.620 --> 02:08:59.620]  I believed he believed a lot of it
[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:01.620]  But
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:03.620]  Even though I snuck into Bohemian Grove and things
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:05.620]  And I first met him
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:07.620]  Right after I snuck in there, I still had trouble believing it
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:09.620]  Since then
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:11.620]  So much, he was the first guy
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:13.620]  I heard talking about the royal family of England
[02:09:13.620 --> 02:09:15.620]  Not really being German, but being from Transylvania
[02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:17.620]  And then
[02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:19.620]  Really being Arabic and all this stuff
[02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.620]  Or Sephardic
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:25.620]  And then
[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:27.620]  Now that's on national news
[02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:29.620]  Now
[02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:31.620]  So just a lot of really wild, wild stuff
[02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:33.620]  And then over the years, so much of it
[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:35.620]  No matter how wild it turned out
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:37.620]  To be true. Now
[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:39.620]  Imagine Fritz, he had
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:41.620]  I don't know how many books out everywhere he went
[02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:43.620]  Selling tons of them, I know we were selling a lot
[02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:45.620]  I happen to know the publisher, I knew they were selling them
[02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:47.620]  He would have no reason
[02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:49.620]  To
[02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:51.620]  Bomb a porno store
[02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:53.620]  Or whatever, and then rob a bank
[02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:55.620]  And I remember him saying
[02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:57.620]  Breaking in my house, they're trying to set me up
[02:09:57.620 --> 02:09:59.620]  I remember seeing it in the news, they've been
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:01.620]  Rating him and stuff
[02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:03.620]  And then boom, they grabbed him and put him in jail
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:05.620]  Now remember, the government has a 99
[02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:07.620]  98%
[02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:09.620]  Conviction rate with the feds
[02:10:09.620 --> 02:10:11.620]  And he's on probation
[02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:13.620]  He's been in jail for many years
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:15.620]  He's lost a lot of weight
[02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:17.620]  I just saw him on Skype a minute ago
[02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:19.620]  He looks better than he did just a few weeks ago
[02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:21.620]  In the one video I've seen of a little presentation
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:23.620]  He did, he'll be back again
[02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:25.620]  We've got to be careful how much he gets into today
[02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:27.620]  But he's agreed, what he wants to talk about is
[02:10:27.620 --> 02:10:29.620]  Who he really is versus the lies of places
[02:10:29.620 --> 02:10:31.620]  Like Wikipedia
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:33.620]  And
[02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:35.620]  What happened to him, what he can say about prison
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:37.620]  And where he sees the world
[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:39.620]  What's seven, eight years after being incarcerated
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:41.620]  But they can do this to anybody
[02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:43.620]  They can plant drugs on yours truly
[02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:45.620]  Or put horrible things on my computer
[02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:47.620]  Or God forbid kill my family
[02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:49.620]  And say I did it, I mean this is the kind of stuff
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:51.620]  The globalist have been caught doing
[02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:53.620]  Operation Northwoods talks about
[02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:55.620]  How to frame Americans for bombings
[02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:57.620]  That the Pentagon carries out
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:59.620]  And frame ups
[02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:01.620]  Our legend now with DNA
[02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:03.620]  We know about a third of people on death row are innocent
[02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:05.620]  And we learn
[02:11:05.620 --> 02:11:07.620]  There was a case in Texas a few weeks ago
[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:09.620]  Where the prosecutor for 20 years
[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:11.620]  Knew the person was innocent
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:13.620]  And knew who did it
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:15.620]  But didn't care, it was about their career
[02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:17.620]  They'll even put people with no criminal record
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:19.620]  Like Fritz in jail
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:21.620]  Usually they like to set somebody who's already got a record
[02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:23.620]  Like people believe it
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:25.620]  Very, very frightening
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:27.620]  And so Fritz Springmeyer
[02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:29.620]  Joins us via video Skype
[02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:31.620]  Fritz
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:33.620]  For people that don't know who you are
[02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:35.620]  A lot of people that have been into the conspiracy
[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:37.620]  Into reality
[02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:39.620]  They of course know who you are
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:41.620]  Over the years they've said where's Fritz Springmeyer
[02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:43.620]  Where's Fritz Springmeyer
[02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:45.620]  Why don't you get his wife on
[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:47.620]  We've tried as you know many times to get her on
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:49.620]  You couldn't because she didn't want to do stuff to you in jail
[02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:51.620]  Now you've been out a while
[02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:53.620]  But obviously
[02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:55.620]  Even for Ricky Ross
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:57.620]  Who started speaking out against government drug dealing
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:11:59.620]  Now they're trying to throw him back in jail
[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:01.620]  So I want you to be very careful here today
[02:12:01.620 --> 02:12:03.620]  We appreciate you giving us the first big interview
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:05.620]  That I know of, correct me if I'm wrong
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:07.620]  Good to have you here Fritz
[02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:09.620]  Tell us who you are
[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:11.620]  A brief snapshot of your life
[02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:13.620]  I know they said you weren't a West Point graduate
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:15.620]  I actually went and looked it up in their rolls
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:17.620]  But the point is they've really attacked you
[02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:19.620]  You hit some things that really
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:21.620]  Scared them, was it
[02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:23.620]  Was it the Transylvanian bloodline
[02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:25.620]  Is it the Satanic rituals
[02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:27.620]  I mean why did they come
[02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:29.620]  Get into who you are, what happened in prison
[02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:31.620]  Why they came after you think
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:33.620]  And now what you see in the world
[02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:37.620]  Wow, that's a lot of questions
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:41.620]  Okay, let's see what we can do with them
[02:12:41.620 --> 02:12:43.620]  First who am I
[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:45.620]  From
[02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:47.620]  For myself
[02:12:47.620 --> 02:12:49.620]  The image I have is
[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:51.620]  Someone who's trying
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:53.620]  To model Christ
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:55.620]  He's my role model
[02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:57.620]  And that's all
[02:12:57.620 --> 02:12:59.620]  That really matters about my life
[02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:01.620]  Is that I be Christ-like
[02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:03.620]  All the labels that
[02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.620]  The system tries to slow
[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:07.620]  The system
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:09.620]  Is labeling people right now
[02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:11.620]  And their computer programs
[02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:13.620]  Carry these labels
[02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:15.620]  Like for instance, two-thirds
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.620]  Of the blacks in major cities
[02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:19.620]  Are labeled as affiliates
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:21.620]  Of gangs or gang members
[02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:23.620]  You know
[02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:25.620]  So there's all kinds of labels
[02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:27.620]  That have been slapped on me
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:29.620]  But the only label that I would want to be
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:31.620]  Identified with is somebody
[02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:33.620]  Who's trying to follow Christ
[02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:35.620]  My life's been unusual
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:37.620]  My father had
[02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:39.620]  The goal of helping
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:41.620]  Save the world
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:43.620]  He was an agricultural expert
[02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:45.620]  And he went around the world
[02:13:45.620 --> 02:13:47.620]  Living in many, many
[02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:49.620]  Third-world countries
[02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:51.620]  And trying to help them
[02:13:51.620 --> 02:13:53.620]  Become self-sufficient
[02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:55.620]  He made a career out of that
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:57.620]  And he passed on the concept of
[02:13:57.620 --> 02:13:59.620]  Trying to save the world to me
[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:01.620]  He said, you know, he said that
[02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:03.620]  If you're going to live life
[02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:05.620]  When you leave it
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:07.620]  Leave the world a better place
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:09.620]  Than what you found it
[02:14:09.620 --> 02:14:11.620]  Sort of like that Boy Scout thing
[02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:13.620]  Is when you go camping
[02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:15.620]  Leave the site better than what you found
[02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:17.620]  And I think
[02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:19.620]  I have
[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:21.620]  Honestly
[02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.620]  Tried to do that
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:25.620]  And accomplish that to some degree
[02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:27.620]  Why were they ticked off at me?
[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:29.620]  I think it was
[02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:31.620]  A combination of a whole bunch
[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:33.620]  Of things that I did
[02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:35.620]  But one of the things
[02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:37.620]  That I was sensitive about
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:39.620]  Was the mind control
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:41.620]  The trauma-based mind control
[02:14:41.620 --> 02:14:43.620]  You'll notice that I
[02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:45.620]  Put out three books on it
[02:14:45.620 --> 02:14:47.620]  With about 40 pages of the actual codes
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:49.620]  That they use on the
[02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:51.620]  Slaves
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:53.620]  And once you have read those books
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:55.620]  And you're familiar with the codes
[02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:57.620]  You can sit there and watch television
[02:14:57.620 --> 02:14:59.620]  And see them manipulate
[02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:01.620]  These total mind-controlled slaves
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:03.620]  Left and right all around us
[02:15:03.620 --> 02:15:05.620]  And people are constantly
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:07.620]  Telling me that
[02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:09.620]  After they got in touch
[02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:11.620]  With my information
[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:13.620]  Now they realize what's going on around them
[02:15:13.620 --> 02:15:15.620]  Another thing
[02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:17.620]  As far as myself-
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:19.620]  How to create a totally
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:21.620]  Undetectable mind-control slave
[02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:23.620]  Which now they admit everything on TV
[02:15:23.620 --> 02:15:25.620]  Is layers of programming
[02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:27.620]  Depending on how programmed you are
[02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:29.620]  And just someone watching TV
[02:15:29.620 --> 02:15:31.620]  Since they were a small child
[02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:33.620]  And actually scientifically
[02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:35.620]  Even BBC admits
[02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:37.620]  In a lower brainwave function
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:39.620]  Than we were just 50 years ago
[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:41.620]  The public in general is in a trance
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:43.620]  Yes
[02:15:43.620 --> 02:15:45.620]  People sit in front of their
[02:15:45.620 --> 02:15:47.620]  Televisions in a trance
[02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:49.620]  In a sense they're almost
[02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:51.620]  Worshiping that
[02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:53.620]  Alter there
[02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:55.620]  Their television alter
[02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:57.620]  So true
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:15:59.620]  What you just said
[02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:01.620]  Others have heard a lot of this
[02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:03.620]  So, you know
[02:16:03.620 --> 02:16:05.620]  I'm not telling them probably anything
[02:16:05.620 --> 02:16:07.620]  That they're not already familiar with
[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:09.620]  Uh
[02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:11.620]  Let's see
[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:13.620]  You were a trailblazer, how did you discover all that
[02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:15.620]  So that made them really angry at you
[02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:17.620]  Yes
[02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:19.620]  I kind of bumped into the whole thing
[02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:21.620]  I view myself as a historian
[02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:23.620]  Not as a conspiracy theorist
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:25.620]  And
[02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:27.620]  I was doing
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:29.620]  A massive amount of research
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:31.620]  Into
[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:33.620]  The elite, you know, because
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:35.620]  We are now a government of the power elite
[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:37.620]  By the power elite
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:39.620]  And for the power elite
[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:41.620]  And I was researching them
[02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:43.620]  To expose them
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:45.620]  And I had the privilege
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:47.620]  Of
[02:16:47.620 --> 02:16:49.620]  Meeting four people
[02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:51.620]  That had been teamed up in the Illuminati
[02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:53.620]  To be a four person team
[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:55.620]  That were trying to get out
[02:16:55.620 --> 02:16:57.620]  And they pointed me in the right
[02:16:57.620 --> 02:16:59.620]  Direction on a lot of things
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:01.620]  I had to do most of the research myself
[02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:03.620]  But because they pointed me
[02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:05.620]  In the right direction
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:07.620]  It really helped me
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:09.620]  And then that's how
[02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:11.620]  I got into the mind control
[02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:13.620]  By the way, just a segue
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:15.620]  I ran into a famous person
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:17.620]  A few weeks ago
[02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:19.620]  And had dinner with him
[02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:21.620]  And they point blank told me
[02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:23.620]  About Illuminati rituals
[02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:25.620]  And Hellfire club and stuff
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:27.620]  But then said I'm not going to talk about that
[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:29.620]  On your show maybe sometime
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:31.620]  So the point is we know these things existed
[02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:33.620]  And do exist
[02:17:33.620 --> 02:17:35.620]  But I mean you're sitting there having dinner
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:37.620]  With a well known famous person
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:39.620]  And they're just point blank telling you all about it
[02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:41.620]  It's just incredible
[02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.620]  And to find out that most of the people
[02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:45.620]  That are part of Oxford
[02:17:45.620 --> 02:17:47.620]  In any of the elite clubs are actually taken to the caves
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:49.620]  Engage in rituals
[02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:51.620]  I mean it's just so widespread
[02:17:51.620 --> 02:17:53.620]  When I grew up in Dallas
[02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:55.620]  People tried to recruit me
[02:17:55.620 --> 02:17:57.620]  Into, and I'm talking about with wealthy people
[02:17:57.620 --> 02:17:59.620]  Into occultic stuff
[02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:01.620]  This stuff is rampant
[02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:03.620]  Yes
[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:05.620]  It is, it's everywhere
[02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:07.620]  And once you're familiar
[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:09.620]  With what it looks like
[02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:11.620]  And smells like
[02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:13.620]  You see it everywhere
[02:18:13.620 --> 02:18:15.620]  I've become almost numb to it
[02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:17.620]  I walk around
[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:19.620]  And I see it all around me
[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:21.620]  And it doesn't even register
[02:18:21.620 --> 02:18:23.620]  Hardly with me that what's going on
[02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:25.620]  Because I've just seen it
[02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:27.620]  For so many years
[02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:29.620]  And been able to recognize it for what it is
[02:18:29.620 --> 02:18:31.620]  Incredible
[02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:33.620]  We're going to break in a moment but this is just amazing
[02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:35.620]  Continue in just one minute before we get back into
[02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:37.620]  What are some of the other things they got mad at you for
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:39.620]  And then clearly set you up
[02:18:39.620 --> 02:18:41.620]  I want to talk about some of how you were set up
[02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:43.620]  It's just incredible
[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:45.620]  Well, you know when I started working
[02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:47.620]  With these four people I was trying to help them
[02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:49.620]  Leave
[02:18:49.620 --> 02:18:51.620]  And when you're in the Illuminati
[02:18:51.620 --> 02:18:53.620]  You don't leave
[02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:55.620]  It's like being in an intelligence agent
[02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:57.620]  When you enter
[02:18:57.620 --> 02:18:59.620]  Like, you know
[02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:01.620]  If you enter the GRU
[02:19:01.620 --> 02:19:03.620]  The KGB or whatever they told you
[02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:05.620]  You know, you don't leave our organization
[02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:07.620]  Well, you don't leave the Illuminati
[02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:09.620]  And that was what
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:11.620]  I was trying to help quite a few people do
[02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:13.620]  And
[02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:15.620]  To the extent of
[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:17.620]  Actually giving away addresses
[02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:19.620]  And names and everything
[02:19:19.620 --> 02:19:21.620]  Of
[02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:23.620]  People that were
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:25.620]  In the lives of the people I was trying to
[02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:27.620]  Rescue
[02:19:27.620 --> 02:19:29.620]  I exposed an entire Illuminati community
[02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:31.620]  In
[02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:33.620]  Bend, Oregon
[02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:35.620]  And they all moved out
[02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:39.620]  They sold their houses
[02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:41.620]  And moved out to different locations
[02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:43.620]  So you were like Van Helsing
[02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:45.620]  Stay there Fritz
[02:19:45.620 --> 02:19:47.620]  You were like Van Helsing exposing them
[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:49.620]  The psychic vampires
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:51.620]  So they wanted to punish you and put you into the jail
[02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:53.620]  Let's come back and talk about this
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:55.620]  On the other side with Fritz Springmeyer
[02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:57.620]  Author of Bloodlines of the Illuminati
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:17.620]  Stay with us
[02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:37.620]  And
[02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:39.620]  Remember

[02:20:41.620 --> 02:20:43.620]  Over $50

[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:09.620]  Or call
[02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:11.620]  Hello I'm Alex Jones
[02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:13.620]  My shelf, my family
[02:21:13.620 --> 02:21:15.620]  The InfoWars.com team
[02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:17.620]  Want to relate to you and your families
[02:21:17.620 --> 02:21:19.620]  That we are intensifying our efforts
[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:21.620]  Against the globalist on every front
[02:21:21.620 --> 02:21:23.620]  InfoWars.com
[02:21:23.620 --> 02:21:30.620]  You will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:34.620]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:40.620]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:50.620]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:59.620]  The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:04.620]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:08.620]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:14.620]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:20.620]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:24.620]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:22:24.620 --> 02:22:28.620]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:32.620]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:22:32.620 --> 02:22:35.620]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:40.620]  Number five, a solar powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:45.620]  Folks, I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:51.620]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:22:51.620 --> 02:22:59.620]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:06.620]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:11.620]  I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job,
[02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:17.620]  that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for you.
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:23.620]  That's not what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:27.620]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:30.620]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:34.620]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:40.620]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:44.620]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios. You should, too.
[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:49.620]  Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:52.620]  800-686-2237.
[02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:55.620]  800-686-2237.
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:24:09.620]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:16.620]  Well, Fritz Springmeyer is our guest, and if he can do it Thursday, I'm broadcasting live for 27 hours total
[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:20.620]  from 11 a.m. until the end of my show the next day.
[02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:25.620]  I might have Aaron to the last hour or something in the official show, but Aaron Dykes,
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:31.620]  I want to invite Fritz back for an hour. We've got so many guests from George Noray to David Eyck to you name it,
[02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:38.620]  joining us that day. It's just going to be amazing. It'll all be free, by the way, not just the audio streams,
[02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:43.620]  but the parts not carried by XM, AM, FM, shortwave satellite, and things like that.
[02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:49.620]  You're going to be able to see free, and I think to beta test it, we're going to have it free on Justin TV,
[02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:57.620]  stream from prismplanet.tv, and a couple different systems embedded at infowars.com and at infowarsmoneybomb.com,
[02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:04.620]  so people can watch the entire 27-hour extravaganza where we try to get the rest of the funding for a couple more crew members,
[02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:11.620]  reporters, more equipment, and the fiber optic systems we need to get the show delivered to TV systems.
[02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:15.620]  Okay, going back to Fritz Springmeyer with us for the rest of the hour, maybe a little bit in the next,
[02:25:15.620 --> 02:25:21.620]  joining us via video Skype. Fritz, you were getting the point of running these guys out of the community,
[02:25:21.620 --> 02:25:27.620]  and I remember you were doing it. The cops were raiding your house, quote, for marijuana, finding nothing,
[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:33.620]  then saying on the news, we found extremist material. Well, of course, you were always in your talks
[02:25:33.620 --> 02:25:37.620]  showing different groups and how they controlled them, and, you know, you're a researcher.
[02:25:37.620 --> 02:25:41.620]  So, I mean, they could come to my house and find Mein Kampf and say he had a Hitler book.
[02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:46.620]  I mean, you know, they could go to a Jewish rabbi's house and find that and say he's a Nazi, I guess.
[02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:50.620]  So then they, so you were warning people, you said they're getting ready to set me up.
[02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:58.620]  Why on earth would you then go rob a bank? And then they used all these disreputable people to do this to you.
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:02.620]  Briefly, tell folks about how you were set up.
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:11.620]  They bribed three real criminals. When I was initially indicted and brought before a federal judge,
[02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:17.620]  Judge Brown, she honestly said, and she told this straight to the DA, she said,
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:25.620]  I'm going to release this man until trial because there is absolutely no evidence against him,
[02:26:25.620 --> 02:26:34.620]  and there never was. And the judge kept saying, the judge that presided over my trial,
[02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:42.620]  he kept saying like it was some kind of a mantra. He said, he kept telling everybody in the courtroom,
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:45.620]  circumstantial evidence can be used to prove anything.
[02:26:45.620 --> 02:26:50.620]  Well, circumstantial evidence is like I went to the mall and I saw Santa Claus.
[02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:55.620]  They saw him on television. I saw a book about him. Therefore Santa Claus exists, you know.
[02:26:55.620 --> 02:27:03.620]  Or I say I went to Scotland, or I say I went to Scotland and I saw the Loch Ness Monster with no proof.
[02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:12.620]  Exactly. And that's what they hung me with. Absolutely no evidence with bribe testimony that didn't even mean anything.
[02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:20.620]  And it's pretty startling, but today juries are going to be looking at what the DA is doing and they're going to,
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:25.620]  obviously my jury, if it was sincerely looking at the issues, must have said,
[02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:29.620]  well, why is the government going to all this trouble if he's not guilty?
[02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:37.620]  You know, because if they looked at what was actually presented in the courtroom, there was nothing really presented.
[02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:42.620]  And by the way, I looked into your case. I looked into your case when I called when this was all starting.
[02:27:42.620 --> 02:27:46.620]  You weren't there, but your wife was. And it was like, oh, he's not worried.
[02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:52.620]  This is all just another attempted setup because you knew it was ridiculous and you knew the first judge had laughed it out,
[02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:59.620]  but they didn't care because a lot of these juries now, they fixate on groveling to the power structure
[02:27:59.620 --> 02:28:04.620]  and they enjoy putting innocent people in jail. I'm telling you, they're sickos.
[02:28:04.620 --> 02:28:10.620]  Yeah. Well, and then I have to wonder if it was really a sincere jury.
[02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:17.620]  It certainly wasn't a jury of my peers. The type of people that were in the, when we did Boy Deer,
[02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:23.620]  the type of people that were available to choose from were definitely people that were pro-establishment.
[02:28:23.620 --> 02:28:31.620]  And to give you just one example of many, one guy had been a lifetime submariner.
[02:28:31.620 --> 02:28:37.620]  Now, if you live on a submarine your entire life, you're going to be someone who follows commands,
[02:28:37.620 --> 02:28:45.620]  believes in the system, blah, blah, blah. You didn't see people that were coming out of the ghetto.
[02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:56.620]  You didn't see any, the entire group of people that were there were white.
[02:28:56.620 --> 02:29:01.620]  There was no minorities in the jury pool to get from.
[02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:10.620]  Personally, I would have rather had some minorities that had a little distrust of the government.
[02:29:10.620 --> 02:29:19.620]  Yeah. Your question about prisons was good and let's maybe address that for a little bit because a lot of your listeners
[02:29:19.620 --> 02:29:25.620]  may eventually during their life face something like that
[02:29:25.620 --> 02:29:30.620]  because we're coming into some really difficult times. When I was a teenager...
[02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:35.620]  Well, friends, I'm sorry. That was a short segment. You'll have a long segment uninterrupted straight ahead.
[02:29:35.620 --> 02:29:41.620]  We'll start at that point when we come back. You're seven, eight years behind the Gulag Wire.
[02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:45.620]  I see you've lost a lot of weight, but your spirit's still there on the other side.
[02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:50.620]  Political prisoner, Fred Springmeier, stay with us.
[02:29:50.620 --> 02:29:57.620]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:29:57.620 --> 02:30:02.620]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:10.620]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:20.620]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you the other way they fit.
[02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:25.620]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:30.620]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:30:30.620 --> 02:30:35.620]  We turned to the other side of the road.
[02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:40.620]  Diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:44.620]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:30:44.620 --> 02:30:47.620]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:30:47.620 --> 02:30:53.620]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[02:30:53.620 --> 02:31:08.620]  Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:29.620]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:32.620]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:36.620]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:41.620]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:46.620]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:08.620]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.

[02:32:27.620 --> 02:32:35.620]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:40.620]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:36.620]  We're going back to Fritz Springmeyer here in just a minute, and I haven't asked him yet, but we're probably getting set up for Thursday as well during the 27-hour live.
[02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:44.620]  I say 27 because it's not really 24. When my show starts over at 11 a.m. Friday, I'll then do that show as well.
[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:52.620]  Just an amazing guest, multiple guests, every hour or so. Some guests like Salente will be more than an hour.
[02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:57.620]  It's going to be power-packed, the fourth annual 2011 Money Bomb.
[02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:00.620]  So check that out at infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:04.620]  Make sure donating now if you want. You normally raise about $100,000 by the time it kicks off.
[02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:10.620]  500,000 is our goals. We can hire a couple more IT people, get some other sites launched.
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:13.620]  We want to get launched a couple new reporters and a bunch of equipment we've got to get.
[02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:17.620]  Just a lot of things like that, and that's why we've built this organization.
[02:34:17.620 --> 02:34:21.620]  And it takes a lot of devalued dollars to get the job done.
[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:29.620]  So infowarsmoneybomb.com, and also when you buy books and videos and tapes and things like bloodlines, the Illuminati.
[02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:35.620]  You not only support our operation at the online bookstore, but you support the writers and researchers like Fritz Springmeyer, political prisoner.
[02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:42.620]  Also, because they're in here telling me to plug this, I think Cade actually designed this one of our graphics people.
[02:34:42.620 --> 02:34:47.620]  I love it. It says, ideas are bulletproof. We the people.
[02:34:47.620 --> 02:34:52.620]  And then it's got Article 1 inside the seal to the First Amendment.
[02:34:52.620 --> 02:34:56.620]  Ideas are bulletproof. We the people. People say, what does that mean?
[02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:01.620]  Well, the First Amendment. And on the back, infowars.com.
[02:35:01.620 --> 02:35:05.620]  A really original designer t-shirt available at infowars.com.
[02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:10.620]  And we couldn't have done any of this without all of you out there supporting the transmission.
[02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:15.620]  Also, in closing with the plug here, don't forget, because the guys were asking, will we do this forever?
[02:35:15.620 --> 02:35:19.620]  And I doubt it. I think it's going to be a seasonal thing.
[02:35:19.620 --> 02:35:24.620]  We have another special. We like to run where you sign up for a year. You get five and a half months free.
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:29.620]  It basically comes out to get almost half a year free when you sign up for that thing we always do around Christmas.
[02:35:29.620 --> 02:35:34.620]  But right now we're running a 15-day free trial, 15-day free trial.
[02:35:34.620 --> 02:35:40.620]  I think it'll probably, I haven't decided yet, but it's going to run at least in the part of November.
[02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:48.620]  15-day free trial, PrisonPlanet.tv, The Nightly News, All My Films, My Book, Paul Watson's Book, The High Quality Commercial Free Podcast.
[02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:54.620]  All of our stuff going back almost nine years. PrisonPlanet.tv, $5.95 a month.
[02:35:54.620 --> 02:35:58.620]  But right now it's free. PrisonPlanet.tv. So easy to sign up there.
[02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:01.620]  Now, going back to political prisoner Fritz Springmeyer.
[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:05.620]  You were talking about, hey, I've been on the other side. Was it seven or eight years?
[02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:10.620]  And you need to know what it's like because a lot of you are probably going to be going there as well.
[02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:17.620]  We have the biggest prison population in the world. They're setting up a martial law internal checkpoint grid with federal gun forces.
[02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:22.620]  They're training neighbors to spy on each other. Jumbotron saying, don't trust your neighbor.
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:26.620]  It's like a dystopic film, sci-fi horror movie.
[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:35.620]  1984 meets Stephen King's The Running Man, meets Brave New World, meets the island of Dr. Maroo.
[02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:38.620]  So please continue Fritz Springmeyer.
[02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:47.620]  Yes, pulling together several of your questions, it would be appropriate to talk about prison.
[02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:55.620]  One of the benefits, one of the good things that my father had taught me was to think for myself.
[02:36:55.620 --> 02:37:01.620]  And so as a teenager, I knew that at some point I was going to bump into the system.
[02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:09.620]  There was a little plaque I put up on my door. It said, when freedom fails, good men rot in filthy jails.
[02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:16.620]  And I told my sister, I said, because I think for myself and I'm willing to do things about what I see,
[02:37:16.620 --> 02:37:19.620]  at some point I'm going to end up in prison.
[02:37:19.620 --> 02:37:27.620]  I knew that I was just going to bump heads with this established system at some point in my life and eventually it happened.
[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:35.620]  Wisdom is knowing what to do, skill is knowing how to do it, and virtue is actually doing it.
[02:37:35.620 --> 02:37:42.620]  And some of your listeners out there are actually going to have the virtue of getting out there and doing things.
[02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:52.620]  And when they do, you know, when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails. That's where a lot of them eventually will end up.
[02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:56.620]  So what happens when you go to prison or jail?
[02:37:56.620 --> 02:38:05.620]  Well, two things. Two things. One is, is you're going to suffer loss, and the other one is, is you're going to wait.
[02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:15.620]  And you're being lucky if you don't lose everything. And how long you wait, you don't know because generally when you first get incarcerated,
[02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:20.620]  they don't tell you how long you're going to be in there and you haven't been sentenced.
[02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:24.620]  So as far as you know, you could be in there the rest of your life or die in there.
[02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:30.620]  So even a week in, in a jail can seem like a very long time.
[02:38:30.620 --> 02:38:40.620]  So that's what, what I would forewarn people about because a lot of people when they get into jail, they start stressing that they're losing stuff.
[02:38:40.620 --> 02:38:45.620]  And they start stressing that they don't know how much time they're going to be incarcerated.
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:51.620]  Let it go. You know, it is what it is. And, and make the best of it and accept it.
[02:38:51.620 --> 02:39:02.620]  The best thing that can happen to get you through the time is to accept the reality that you've been incarcerated and start making the best of it.
[02:39:02.620 --> 02:39:17.620]  If you mentally fight the thing, you just, you just go through proxisms of, of torture, accept what's happened and then move on in life and make the best of it.
[02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:21.620]  And that's what we have to do. We have to take the good with the bad and make the best of it.
[02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:23.620]  Like you've been trying to do with your show.
[02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:30.620]  You know, I really love a lot of the things that, that you've done.
[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:38.620]  I like your t-shirts that you're advertising because I think part of the solution is we've got to, we've got to laugh.
[02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:44.620]  You know, I mean, you've got charity, you know, legalized freedom t-shirt.
[02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:51.620]  You know, that's humorous. That's, that's part of the, the, the answer.
[02:39:51.620 --> 02:40:02.620]  You know, I hope your listeners out there buy these kind of things and walk around and, you know, get some chuckles.
[02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:13.620]  Well, I think what you're getting at here is don't let it crush your spirit and use it as a learning experience and feel sorry for the people that are in there feeding you GMO
[02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:23.620]  and soy based food and enjoying your pain because, because they are hurting themselves, hurting their soul,
[02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:31.620]  literally tying heavy weights and chains around themselves in God's eyes and really weighting themselves down for the drop into Hades.
[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:39.620]  But it's one thing to imagine it. You have, you have lived through it, Fred. You lost a lot of weight. Why is that?
[02:40:39.620 --> 02:40:50.620]  Well, halfway through my bit, I started exercising and it was intentional to lose the weight.
[02:40:50.620 --> 02:40:58.620]  I'm healthier. I've been exercising for the last five years on a regular basis.
[02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:04.620]  So I'm actually healthier than when I went in. That's one of the advantages.
[02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:12.620]  I, like I say, I, I took the time that I had to do and I used it for good.
[02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:22.620]  While I was in there, I spent five years teaching GD. I got high school GD diplomas for a lot of the guys.
[02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:26.620]  I was using my time productively.
[02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:35.620]  And that's one of the things that I want to encourage people to do is, is, you know, we've, we've just got to take the cards that we've been dealt
[02:41:35.620 --> 02:41:41.620]  and do the best we can with them. And of course, they're trying to deal us the worst cards that they can.
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:49.620]  But hey, it's not over until the fat lady in God's choir seems, you know.
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:54.620]  Well, well said. No, no, no, please continue.
[02:41:54.620 --> 02:42:10.620]  Well, I think you and, and, and some of the other people out there that are doing what you're doing are examples of, of what, what needs to be done.
[02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:22.620]  And that is, you know, you're trying to make people self sufficient, get people to think for themselves, get people to quit, quit being a sheeple and, and, and think for themselves.
[02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:32.620]  And if we can win the hearts of the people, their minds and bodies will follow along.
[02:42:32.620 --> 02:42:40.620]  Do you forgive the people that, that lied about you and persecuted you and put you in jail for how many years was it for us?
[02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:56.620]  Well, I was given 111 month sentence, and I did eight years actual time. And, and then about a year ago, I was released. They, they, I was out for three months.
[02:42:56.620 --> 02:43:02.620]  And then for no reason, at least they never gave me any specific reason.
[02:43:02.620 --> 02:43:12.620]  They just re arrested me and held me on a Marshall's hold under investigation for another two and a half months and never charged me with anything.
[02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:20.620]  Like I say, never gave me a specific reason as to why they put me back in the prison. And then they released me towards the end of March.
[02:43:20.620 --> 02:43:26.620]  So now I've been out for what approximately seven months this last time.
[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:34.620]  And we've been contacting and trying to get you on. You said, I'm not ready yet. Why did you email us last week and say you were ready now?
[02:43:34.620 --> 02:43:49.620]  It's been a year and I feel more comfortable. It was like maybe making the analogy. I wanted to sail the boat a little ways before I started rocking the boat.
[02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:52.620]  Exactly. You wanted to get to feel the boat first.
[02:43:52.620 --> 02:43:54.620]  Yes.
[02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:58.620]  All right, let me read some quotes here. I think it was Johann Goeth that said it.
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:02.620]  It's just got two quotes there in his name under it instead of university, but we're checking it.
[02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:10.620]  Correct us if we're wrong. He said both none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe that they are free.
[02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:16.620]  That's a take off the Bible of, you know, have not, I mean, has eyes but still cannot see.
[02:44:16.620 --> 02:44:27.620]  Here's another one. No one escapes when freedom fails. The best men rot in filthy jails and those that cried appease appease are hanged by those they tried to please.
[02:44:27.620 --> 02:44:35.620]  So the point is you also get put in prison fighting tyranny, but if you don't fight tyranny, they actually kill you.
[02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:44.620]  Yes. One of my favorite quotes is Sam Adams said, if you love wealth better than liberty, crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you
[02:44:44.620 --> 02:44:48.620]  and may posterity forget that you are our countrymen.
[02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:53.620]  At last part may posterity forget that you are our countrymen.
[02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:56.620]  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[02:44:56.620 --> 02:45:00.620]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That tickles my funny bone there.
[02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:09.620]  Well, Prince, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong. You seem kind of tired a little bit in the one video I've seen where you gave a speech to a small group of people.
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:15.620]  But now you seem even more energized than when the few times I met you and watched you a decade ago.
[02:45:15.620 --> 02:45:20.620]  You seem to have actually been made stronger by this persecution.
[02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:39.620]  Yes. And yeah, I have been. I've, like I say, I use the time productively and worked on myself. One of the things that happened during the 90s, the 1990s, which people really can't appreciate.
[02:45:39.620 --> 02:45:48.620]  But I gave so much of myself. I was I opened my house up to victims of Illuminati mind control.
[02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:53.620]  I had people coming in from around the world trying to get deprogrammed.
[02:45:53.620 --> 02:45:59.620]  I was doing research around the clock. I was writing. I was traveling.
[02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:05.620]  I was sleeping very little and I was donating my life to everybody else.
[02:46:05.620 --> 02:46:09.620]  And when I went to prison, I finally got some time to work on myself.
[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:23.620]  And so it was like a vacation. Yeah, I could work on myself, get my health back, do exercise, all the things that I had neglected while I was trying to help everyone else.
[02:46:23.620 --> 02:46:27.620]  So no weapon formed against you will prosper.
[02:46:27.620 --> 02:46:29.620]  That's right, brother.
[02:46:29.620 --> 02:46:36.620]  All right, continuing here. And by the way, folks, I've looked at the case 100% set up. I mean, that shows you how criminal this government is.
[02:46:36.620 --> 02:46:42.620]  And people ask, well, then why am I still on air? Well, I've been physically attacked. I've been demonized seven ways this Sunday.
[02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:49.620]  National TV grassroots. You name it. Total Co and tell pro. I've been threatened and I've just put it in God's hands.
[02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:52.620]  That's a your prayers be.
[02:46:52.620 --> 02:47:00.620]  But see, I'm so high profile from their view. They don't want to highlight everything I've said, put 1000 exclamation points behind it.
[02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:05.620]  But I'm not stupid. I know that if God wasn't there protecting me, I would already be dead.
[02:47:05.620 --> 02:47:13.620]  But it's that it's coming to sports analogy. They tell you go 110% every play in football, or you've got a much better chance of getting hurt.
[02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:17.620]  It's when you don't go 100% or 110% you get hurt every time.
[02:47:17.620 --> 02:47:24.620]  And my view is, look, I'm in point of return. It's actually a good feeling. Commit to it, whatever happens.
[02:47:24.620 --> 02:47:30.620]  You know what? I tried to be the best person I could. And that's why I'm still alive and still here.
[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:36.620]  And it's a fight between good and evil. There's a lot of good people in government who are compartmentalized.
[02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:43.620]  And some of us have got to put our nails on the chalkboard to wake them up.
[02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:48.620]  Because as Mark Twain said in the beginning of Patriots, a scarce man hated and feared and scorned and brave.
[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:53.620]  But in time when the cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[02:47:53.620 --> 02:48:01.620]  We've got to hit that bar bar Fritz. I want your perspective on this and the time we have it a few other issues. We'll have you back soon while you're here.
[02:48:01.620 --> 02:48:09.620]  But why do you think I'm still alive and still around? Because I 100% know I'm for real. I 100% know we're bearing good fruits overall.
[02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:16.620]  I'm not perfect. I look back sometimes in horror at what I've done. Why do you think I'm still around?
[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:27.620]  They don't think that we're going to make that big of a difference. I used to ask myself why they made attempts on my life.
[02:48:27.620 --> 02:48:37.620]  And I blame God for having rescued me through those attempts. But then why didn't they continue to persist?
[02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:48.620]  I think because on the one hand they're like, okay, let these people do what they want.
[02:48:48.620 --> 02:49:01.620]  And I'll be frank here. When people come online and go to your site, they're identifying themselves to the New World Order that they're opposed to the New World Order.
[02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:08.620]  They've been tagged. They've identified themselves. I agree. They're using it as a gauge.
[02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:16.620]  And so that's why I say, good, put my name on the list, the top of the list. This is about us coming out in the light and saying, so what if vampires put me on a list?
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:21.620]  We're putting you guys on list. We've got to get past their intimidation.
[02:49:21.620 --> 02:49:38.620]  Right. Exactly. Exactly. They're so prideful and they view their power as being almost Godlike absolute that they really question whether we can do anything.
[02:49:38.620 --> 02:49:48.620]  And in their eyes, we do them by identifying who's against them. We help them out.
[02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:54.620]  And they think they can squash us like bugs whenever they absolutely need to.
[02:49:54.620 --> 02:50:04.620]  I have noticed that's the one big weakness of the Illuminati is they are insanely arrogant on power trips, almost to the point of being kind of mentally retarded.
[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:09.620]  I mean, they really are pathetic because I see how the system destroys its own people.
[02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:15.620]  I've seen just from my own dead reckoning that statistically it's more dangerous to serve them than to fight them.
[02:50:15.620 --> 02:50:18.620]  Have you noticed that anomaly?
[02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:29.620]  Oh, that you, your words are 100% correct. That's why these people wanted out of the Illuminati is it's not a fun place.
[02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:38.620]  You might think, well, you know, because I bumped into some people that have told me friends, I'm watching this thing from the sidelines and I want to be on the winning team.
[02:50:38.620 --> 02:50:45.620]  And it looks like the Illuminati is going to be the winning team. So that's who I'm going to go with. No, no, no, no, no.
[02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:51.620]  They don't realize the pain and what you give up to be on that side.
[02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:57.620]  Exactly. It's such a scam. Stay there. Let's talk about that. I mean, you don't make a deal with the devil, folks.
[02:50:57.620 --> 02:51:01.620]  Even if you think you got a deal, it's not a deal.
[02:51:01.620 --> 02:51:06.620]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:12.620]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[02:52:06.620 --> 02:52:12.620]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:17.620]  Number one, study the past. History really does repeat itself.
[02:52:17.620 --> 02:52:21.620]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:25.620]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:34.620]  A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis. That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves.
[02:52:34.620 --> 02:52:38.620]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.

[02:52:41.620 --> 02:52:46.620]  This book is only available at RisingPricesEmptyShelves.com.

[02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:24.620]  We're going to do a little bit of overdrive with Fritz Springmeyer, and I hope you don't get thrown in the clink in this interview.
[02:54:24.620 --> 02:54:27.620]  There's certain subjects he's been told not to get into.
[02:54:27.620 --> 02:54:30.620]  Oh, you don't get your free speech back when you get out of prison, isn't that funny?
[02:54:30.620 --> 02:54:33.620]  And they certainly have shut him up.
[02:54:33.620 --> 02:54:36.620]  I want to get to your calls, too, folks, and I've got other news I haven't gotten to.
[02:54:36.620 --> 02:54:40.620]  I've got so many little subjects I want to bring up with Fritz and I almost don't want to stop the show,
[02:54:40.620 --> 02:54:44.620]  but I've got to go do the nightly news as well because I want to get to everything.
[02:54:44.620 --> 02:54:47.620]  I might just do some extended overdrive here, but we've got to talk to Fritz during the break.
[02:54:47.620 --> 02:54:50.620]  But I've also got to get ready for the Money Bomb 27-hour broadcast.
[02:54:50.620 --> 02:54:59.620]  Fritz has agreed to be on with us at 11 o'clock, his time Pacific on Thursday.
[02:54:59.620 --> 02:55:03.620]  And of course, I'll be live then, so that'll be one o'clock in the morning, our time.
[02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:08.620]  And then of course, all this will be archived at PrisonPlanet.tv and also put on the YouTube channel.
[02:55:08.620 --> 02:55:13.620]  We're going to have free boxes of different systems to watch it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:15.620]  We're going to have a Justin TV channel and others.
[02:55:15.620 --> 02:55:21.620]  And wow, we got 3 million people to watch Aaron when he was at Bilderberg covering it just on our Justin TV.
[02:55:21.620 --> 02:55:24.620]  3.2 million in a three-day period watch that channel.
[02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:26.620]  So this is going to be big.
[02:55:26.620 --> 02:55:29.620]  Get the word out of the Money Bomb Transmission.
[02:55:29.620 --> 02:55:35.620]  I'm going to try to tomorrow have the live Money Bomb page already up at infowars.com.
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:42.620]  That'll have all the different players and things so you can get that link out to everybody for this historic transmission.
[02:55:42.620 --> 02:55:50.620]  Now going back to Fritz here, political prisoner, author of Bloodlines the Illuminati, available at infowars.com.
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:57.620]  Before Fritz leaves this, we'll also get an address if folks want to get the book directly from him and his family.
[02:55:57.620 --> 02:56:01.620]  But Fritz, this is a short segment, as you know, one more little short one and we'll probably end it there.
[02:56:01.620 --> 02:56:07.620]  But I almost don't want to because we got you now and I've been wanting to talk to you for eight years.
[02:56:07.620 --> 02:56:12.620]  You were bringing up the fact of this isn't even a deal at all. People think they have a choice.
[02:56:12.620 --> 02:56:19.620]  Join the, quote, winning New World Order and get some temporary money or whatever or join good and be persecuted.
[02:56:19.620 --> 02:56:23.620]  I've actually studying this. You're a lot better off joining good.
[02:56:23.620 --> 02:56:26.620]  There's this illusion you have to have the courage to first do it.
[02:56:26.620 --> 02:56:28.620]  You'll get attacked up front.
[02:56:28.620 --> 02:56:31.620]  But when you almost, like you've done, you've learned the secret and that's what I've learned.
[02:56:31.620 --> 02:56:35.620]  And I hate to even say this because it feels sick but it's not.
[02:56:35.620 --> 02:56:39.620]  I was never sadomasochistic and I don't mean like I like being hit and stuff. I don't.
[02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:46.620]  But when I get persecuted and lied about, it's like somehow God in my brain turns it around and makes it almost enjoyable.
[02:56:46.620 --> 02:56:52.620]  Even though it's hurting very badly, what do you think that phenomenon is?
[02:56:52.620 --> 02:56:57.620]  And if you, it sounds like you've experienced that as well, Fritz.
[02:56:57.620 --> 02:57:00.620]  Well, when you know you're right, you know you're right.
[02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:09.620]  And if everybody else wants to be a living and run off the cliff, so that's their problem.
[02:57:09.620 --> 02:57:17.620]  You know what you're doing and you have, when we go through our day to day lies,
[02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:29.620]  if we just have a nine to five job where we just sell our soul to the system and we were dead inside, you know.
[02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:34.620]  Versus someone like you, you know what you're doing.
[02:57:34.620 --> 02:57:41.620]  You know what you're doing is right. You have a joy and that joy brings life to you.
[02:57:41.620 --> 02:57:46.620]  You know, anybody who watches you can see that you have a lot of life.
[02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:55.620]  And versus somebody who's physically alive but their soul's been killed.
[02:57:55.620 --> 02:58:05.620]  And you can't replace that, you know. You're not going to throw away what you have to be a dead person
[02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:11.620]  that just like a zombie walking through their little system.
[02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:14.620]  That's what I would, how I would describe.
[02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:20.620]  Fritz, that's it. Listen, I am so fulfilled with this knowledge and it's not even fear anymore
[02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:25.620]  that it's all, people say they're unfulfilled. Do you ever experience it where you're so fulfilled
[02:58:25.620 --> 02:58:31.620]  with understanding and things that it's almost, like it's so good you can't stand it? The joy.
[02:58:31.620 --> 02:58:51.620]  Sure. Stay there. Stay there. Gotta break. I want to get your, oh, this is incredible. Unbelievable.
[02:58:51.620 --> 02:58:59.620]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.620 --> 02:59:04.620]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:59:04.620 --> 02:59:10.620]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.620 --> 02:59:15.620]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:59:15.620 --> 02:59:23.620]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:59:23.620 --> 02:59:25.620]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:59:25.620 --> 02:59:32.620]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:59:32.620 --> 02:59:39.620]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:59:39.620 --> 02:59:59.620]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:00:09.620 --> 03:00:18.620]  Well, this has been an amazing interview and the woods are lovely dark and deep but I have miles to go before I sleep.
[03:00:18.620 --> 03:00:26.620]  I don't know if we should end this in five minutes or we should do 15 more with Fritz on the other side and maybe take some calls.
[03:00:26.620 --> 03:00:29.620]  Fritz, I'm looking forward to having you with us Thursday.
[03:00:29.620 --> 03:00:42.620]  So you were getting into the joy of knowing you're right, knowing you're on target and knowing that you're not part of the darkness because once you realize just how dark that darkness really is,
[03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:47.620]  once you realize just what it is, it's like my goodness.
[03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:53.620]  You know, they sell this image of the devil as the devil cheerleader, Marilyn Monroe, all hot and sizzling and it's inviting.
[03:00:53.620 --> 03:01:06.620]  But really it's not, it's desiccating, it's soul sucking and as you said these are the servants of this are zombies bought for nothing out of money made up out of nothing.
[03:01:06.620 --> 03:01:08.620]  Exactly.
[03:01:08.620 --> 03:01:15.620]  Fool's gold, counterfeit money, the devil pays in counterfeit money.
[03:01:15.620 --> 03:01:17.620]  Are you able to still hear me?
[03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:19.620]  Yes, I'm just listening to you.
[03:01:19.620 --> 03:01:21.620]  We've got three or four minutes left.
[03:01:21.620 --> 03:01:24.620]  Genetic engineering, they're coming out with mosquitoes.
[03:01:24.620 --> 03:01:30.620]  They're going to release to forcibly inoculate us, cross splicing all.
[03:01:30.620 --> 03:01:35.620]  What concerns you most about the New World Order's master plan?
[03:01:35.620 --> 03:01:37.620]  Wow, where to begin?
[03:01:37.620 --> 03:01:41.620]  It's, it's, it's just death.
[03:01:41.620 --> 03:01:44.620]  The whole program is death.
[03:01:44.620 --> 03:01:52.620]  You know, all aspects of it, it's just to kill everything that's good and decent.
[03:01:52.620 --> 03:02:00.620]  And, and then this tampering, trying to be God tampering with, with genetics.
[03:02:00.620 --> 03:02:10.620]  And we already have plenty of examples out there of horse, horror stories of, of when they've tried to tamper with nature.
[03:02:10.620 --> 03:02:20.620]  You would think that, that people would be up in arms because of all of the, the bad examples that are already there.
[03:02:20.620 --> 03:02:23.620]  Yeah, what, what concerns me most?
[03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:24.620]  Wow.
[03:02:24.620 --> 03:02:35.620]  Well, right now, the, the biggest issue that's facing us on our plate is, you know, they're going to crash the economy and there's going to be a lot of suffering.
[03:02:35.620 --> 03:02:46.620]  And I don't like to see people suffer and I hope that people will mitigate that by doing things that where they're more self-reliant.
[03:02:46.620 --> 03:02:53.620]  But I know that a lot of people won't be able to or won't do it because they're walking in ignorance.
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:02:56.620]  And so there's just going to be a lot of suffering.
[03:02:56.620 --> 03:02:58.620]  I'm already seeing it all around me.
[03:02:58.620 --> 03:03:09.620]  And right now in the immediate future, that's, that's my immediate concern is, is all the suffering that people are going to go through economically.
[03:03:09.620 --> 03:03:17.620]  We've got, further on down the road, we've got even more mean, nasty things planned for the world.
[03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:20.620]  Well, you know, friends, I've waited eight years to talk to you.
[03:03:20.620 --> 03:03:22.620]  And so, you know what?
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:26.620]  Even though I've got stuff piled, mountains high.
[03:03:26.620 --> 03:03:32.620]  Do one more 12, 13-minute segment with us to talk about the Illuminati Master Plan.
[03:03:32.620 --> 03:03:34.620]  The program is death.
[03:03:34.620 --> 03:03:36.620]  The back of my film Endgame says they want you dead.
[03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:38.620]  But what is their program, friends?
[03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:40.620]  Death. I mean, that is it.
[03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:48.620]  They've got all these intellectual excuses mid-level for their technicians that don't see all of it or even a large part of the system.
[03:03:48.620 --> 03:03:54.620]  But when you get back away from it and actually see from an Illuminati's viewpoint by study and reverse engineering,
[03:03:54.620 --> 03:03:56.620]  the program is death.
[03:03:56.620 --> 03:04:02.620]  It's a giant system to trick even their own servants into setting up a giant kill machine.
[03:04:02.620 --> 03:04:08.620]  At the very highest level, the Illuminati, some of them actually know that or into this nihilistic death thing.
[03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:12.620]  And I've actually quoted some of those globalists and transhumanists saying that,
[03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:15.620]  that they want to blow the planet up just because they want to go unwilling.
[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:17.620]  I'm sure you've seen those quotes.
[03:04:17.620 --> 03:04:19.620]  I mean, this is literally death.
[03:04:19.620 --> 03:04:21.620]  They ask, what is the Endgame death?
[03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:24.620]  It's like James Bond saying in, was it Goldfinger?
[03:04:24.620 --> 03:04:26.620]  He says, do you expect me to talk?
[03:04:26.620 --> 03:04:28.620]  And he goes, no, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:30.620]  I mean, that's, it's death.
[03:04:30.620 --> 03:04:31.620]  People say, what's the goal?
[03:04:31.620 --> 03:04:32.620]  It's death.
[03:04:32.620 --> 03:04:33.620]  Where are they going?
[03:04:33.620 --> 03:04:34.620]  Death.
[03:04:34.620 --> 03:04:35.620]  What do they want for the world?
[03:04:35.620 --> 03:04:36.620]  Death.
[03:04:36.620 --> 03:04:37.620]  What are they into?
[03:04:37.620 --> 03:04:38.620]  Death.
[03:04:38.620 --> 03:04:39.620]  What's their Endgame?
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:40.620]  Destruction.
[03:04:40.620 --> 03:04:41.620]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[03:04:41.620 --> 03:04:43.620]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:47.620]  They only want to steal and destroy because they want to kill you.
[03:04:47.620 --> 03:04:48.620]  Death.
[03:04:48.620 --> 03:04:49.620]  Death.
[03:04:49.620 --> 03:04:51.620]  Burnout planet.
[03:04:51.620 --> 03:04:52.620]  Dead planet.
[03:04:52.620 --> 03:04:53.620]  Extinct planet.
[03:04:53.620 --> 03:04:54.620]  Fred Springmeyer is our guest.
[03:04:54.620 --> 03:04:58.620]  Stay with us for one more segment as he looks forward with what the Illuminati master plan
[03:04:58.620 --> 03:04:59.620]  is.
[03:04:59.620 --> 03:05:00.620]  We've talked about him now.
[03:05:00.620 --> 03:05:01.620]  Now we're going to get us viewed.
[03:05:01.620 --> 03:05:03.620]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[03:05:03.620 --> 03:05:05.620]  Storeable foods are also in high demand.
[03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:10.620]  Big Berkeywaterfilters.com has always kept our focus on the Berkey water filter products.
[03:05:10.620 --> 03:05:14.620]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storeable foods.

[03:05:21.620 --> 03:05:22.620]  foods.

[03:05:35.620 --> 03:05:40.120]  or even stagnant pond water with our storeable foods, and you have a winning combination.

[03:08:19.380 --> 03:08:25.740]  He'll be back with us 1 a.m. during the 27 hour broadcast. That'll be Friday morning,
[03:08:25.740 --> 03:08:31.180]  the first hour, I guess, a Friday, and we'll have free video streaming boxes at Infowars
[03:08:31.180 --> 03:08:36.540]  and Prison Planet. We're going to try to fire those up tomorrow for Tuesdays and Wednesday
[03:08:36.540 --> 03:08:45.700]  show ahead of the fourth annual funding mechanism here, the Infowars Money Bomb 2011. Don't forget
[03:08:45.700 --> 03:08:50.980]  we have 15 days free now. You can sign up and do a 15 day free deal at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:50.980 --> 03:08:54.540]  You get the nightly news, all of it. We are listener supported. We're doing this because
[03:08:54.540 --> 03:08:58.580]  of your support and growing exponentially. If we're going to fight the globalists, might
[03:08:58.580 --> 03:09:04.060]  as well do it 110%. Now, in a little bit of time, we've got left here until you come back.
[03:09:04.060 --> 03:09:06.940]  People obviously wanted to hear about what happened to you, what went on. It's a great
[03:09:06.940 --> 03:09:11.780]  window into our society, Fritz Springmeyer. But in the 12 minutes we've got left, now
[03:09:11.780 --> 03:09:17.140]  11 minutes, I want to just throw issues out at you and get a quick response in a minute
[03:09:17.140 --> 03:09:21.700]  or so to get your view and your take on things. But first, and if you don't have it in front
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:26.140]  of you, I forgot to tell you, find it and we'll have it at the end. But is there an
[03:09:26.140 --> 03:09:30.980]  address where folks can write and get bloodlines, the Illuminati or your other books? How do
[03:09:30.980 --> 03:09:35.020]  people, is there an email? How do folks contact you?
[03:09:35.020 --> 03:09:45.060]  Okay. They can contact me at SpringmeyerMessages at HopMail.com and they need to spell my
[03:09:45.060 --> 03:09:54.300]  name, Springmeyer, S-P-R-I-N-G-M-E-I-E-R and then Messages at HopMail.com. That will,
[03:09:54.300 --> 03:09:59.660]  and then of course, the bloodlines book is available from you. So I recommend that they
[03:09:59.660 --> 03:10:01.820]  buy it from you, actually.
[03:10:01.820 --> 03:10:09.700]  Well, fantastic. Again, folks can go to the Springmeyer site right there and it's very
[03:10:09.700 --> 03:10:13.460]  important to support you obviously so that you can defend yourself again if they try
[03:10:13.460 --> 03:10:19.500]  to set you up. We need to get you back on that original work you were doing. But hopefully,
[03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:25.060]  my dad always told me, he's a really smart guy. He said, son, even before I got on radio,
[03:10:25.060 --> 03:10:29.700]  he said when you go up against big crooks, they tend to just ignore you. But if you
[03:10:29.700 --> 03:10:36.300]  go up against little local corrupt people or little criminals, that's who you actually
[03:10:36.300 --> 03:10:40.100]  got to worry about. And I think the fact that you were right in the middle of a nest of
[03:10:40.100 --> 03:10:44.860]  them is why they set you up and did that. But moving on along here, let me just throw
[03:10:44.860 --> 03:10:46.820]  issues out at you.
[03:10:46.820 --> 03:10:50.020]  Playing God, genetic engineering, we already covered that to a certain extent. What about
[03:10:50.020 --> 03:10:58.700]  Al-Qaeda 9-11, the mind control of 9-11, the system now putting Al-Qaeda in charge in
[03:10:58.700 --> 03:11:05.820]  Libya, in Egypt, in trying in Syria, I mean, in plain view saying we're taking your rights
[03:11:05.820 --> 03:11:11.740]  because of Al-Qaeda, but Al-Qaeda is trying to attack you, so we're going to put him
[03:11:11.740 --> 03:11:17.580]  in charge. What's the whole Al-Qaeda Saudi Arabian situation and the whole New World
[03:11:17.580 --> 03:11:19.140]  Order constellation?
[03:11:19.140 --> 03:11:25.620]  Well, we're working on a number of agendas there, but two agendas, and they tie into
[03:11:25.620 --> 03:11:31.700]  what you were saying about death. Two of the agendas is, is we're working towards a world
[03:11:31.700 --> 03:11:37.300]  war, and we're also working towards a world religion where they're going to destroy all
[03:11:37.300 --> 03:11:45.220]  fundamental religions and replace it with their world religion, which will be a satanic-based
[03:11:45.220 --> 03:11:53.220]  religion. And so Christianity and fundamental Islam are being discredited, and you have a
[03:11:53.220 --> 03:12:04.380]  lot of fundamentalists that are being exploited by the media to make people reject Christianity
[03:12:04.380 --> 03:12:12.660]  and Islam. So we've got that agenda going. We've got also the process where they're
[03:12:12.660 --> 03:12:20.940]  bringing all these elements together to create another world war. You know, all of these
[03:12:20.940 --> 03:12:25.580]  agendas like you were saying, you summed it all up by just saying it's death. One of
[03:12:25.580 --> 03:12:32.060]  the things that means so much to us are our children, and one of their agendas is to take
[03:12:32.060 --> 03:12:39.260]  away the right to have children. You'll notice the process, and when I was in counseling
[03:12:39.260 --> 03:12:45.900]  in college, my professor said, if you're looking at a situation, don't look at the details
[03:12:45.900 --> 03:12:51.020]  because the details may be contradictory, but look at the process. You'll see that there's
[03:12:51.020 --> 03:12:56.580]  a process to create a world war. You'll see there's a process to discredit Christianity.
[03:12:56.580 --> 03:13:02.820]  You'll see there's a process here in many, many different ways to discredit the idea
[03:13:02.820 --> 03:13:10.140]  of people having children, and at some point the government will be able to take that over,
[03:13:10.140 --> 03:13:18.780]  these children in factories, and then of course, we'll have the mind control full blown, then
[03:13:18.780 --> 03:13:24.180]  they can produce whatever they want. If they need a certain model soldier, they'll produce
[03:13:24.180 --> 03:13:30.660]  it. If they need a certain model slave labor, they'll produce that slave. They'll be under
[03:13:30.660 --> 03:13:38.460]  that type of mind control that's the program, like a computer. Basically what they'll be
[03:13:38.460 --> 03:13:45.900]  creating is human robots, and they've been doing that already, so they've already had
[03:13:45.900 --> 03:13:53.940]  the ability to do that. It's just that there's still some of us around that are free men
[03:13:53.940 --> 03:13:57.740]  that think with our still free thinkers.
[03:13:57.740 --> 03:14:02.260]  Well, that's one of their mind control programs is to tell us we don't have free will. We're
[03:14:02.260 --> 03:14:07.220]  not allowed to have our own moral beliefs, but they have theirs. They all know it's about
[03:14:07.220 --> 03:14:11.020]  free will. They want to tell you there's no free will, and they admit the military with
[03:14:11.020 --> 03:14:15.460]  the drills and the codes and the files. It's all about making you do something over and
[03:14:15.460 --> 03:14:21.140]  over again until it just becomes automatic. That's what TSA always wanting more, more,
[03:14:21.140 --> 03:14:28.460]  more, more power. Again, it's about training us, breaking our will. What's the time frame
[03:14:28.460 --> 03:14:33.700]  fritz on all this? I mean, everybody can feel it. We're going into an incredible time. Why
[03:14:33.700 --> 03:14:38.580]  are people in their gut not just intellectually so upset right now? What's coming?
[03:14:38.580 --> 03:14:47.540]  Wow. The time frame that I had been originally given by people that had listened into planning
[03:14:47.540 --> 03:14:54.780]  sessions isn't working out, so I think that they went from the quick planned to some long
[03:14:54.780 --> 03:15:05.060]  range planning. I'm going to say within 10 or 20 years, we should see the realization
[03:15:05.060 --> 03:15:13.580]  of pretty much of all the agenda. I would expect within 10 years that we will have had
[03:15:13.580 --> 03:15:22.140]  some kind of a major cataclysmic world war. I would say the United States, as we know
[03:15:22.140 --> 03:15:31.020]  it, will not exist in 20 years. You won't recognize whatever is here politically in
[03:15:31.020 --> 03:15:34.340]  relationship to the United States. We understand.
[03:15:34.340 --> 03:15:40.620]  Bingo. Let me stop here right there because George Bush, the UN, they were going to have
[03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:45.300]  the capping in 2000 of the pyramid, but they said, no, the great work is not complete.
[03:15:45.300 --> 03:15:52.100]  I watched on PBS an open public satanic Illuminati Ritual broadcast worldwide with George Herbert
[03:15:52.100 --> 03:15:57.140]  Walker Bush there, and they said the great work is not done. They had a long term accelerated
[03:15:57.140 --> 03:16:02.740]  program. The good news is, it's not working the way they want it. They're able to devastate
[03:16:02.740 --> 03:16:06.500]  certain groups, but it's actually having the opposite effect, and then it's waking up
[03:16:06.500 --> 03:16:12.420]  a lot of people. They've actually said they've had to switch their program, and so can we
[03:16:12.420 --> 03:16:17.620]  get a reprieve like Nineveh? I'm not saying it'd be 100 years, but in a way it looks
[03:16:17.620 --> 03:16:22.580]  like we've gotten a reprieve for a while to have a chance to wake more people up so
[03:16:22.580 --> 03:16:30.860]  that their spirits can be in the right place. Yes, God, I blame God for that. We can sum
[03:16:30.860 --> 03:16:37.620]  up all of these different factors that brought this reprieve up in just the word divine intervention.
[03:16:37.620 --> 03:16:45.340]  Yeah, we have. They've switched from the fast track to the slow track, but they still intend
[03:16:45.340 --> 03:16:52.340]  to carry out their global tyranny and their global slavery and all these other agendas
[03:16:52.340 --> 03:16:59.620]  that you've been exposing. But yeah, you're right. What you said was so well said, I couldn't
[03:16:59.620 --> 03:17:00.820]  have said it better.
[03:17:00.820 --> 03:17:07.100]  And again, it seems like a fast track right now, but it would be even faster. Look, there's
[03:17:07.100 --> 03:17:12.540]  also a lot of good people left on the planet, and God, the universe, wherever people want
[03:17:12.540 --> 03:17:17.820]  to call it, is giving people a chance to get out there and warn people because there is
[03:17:17.820 --> 03:17:22.180]  a universal law. That's why the Illuminati follows it, like the vampire has to get permission
[03:17:22.180 --> 03:17:27.580]  to come in your house, you know, for this system to come through, everybody's got to
[03:17:27.580 --> 03:17:32.180]  have a chance to hear the truth repeatedly. Do you agree with that universal law?
[03:17:32.180 --> 03:17:46.220]  Yeah, I agree with that. Well said, it's God's given this planet a respectable chance, and
[03:17:46.220 --> 03:17:51.180]  we're not going to be able to face him on Judgment Day and say, well, I didn't know
[03:17:51.180 --> 03:17:56.260]  or I didn't have a chance because the chance has been offered.
[03:17:56.260 --> 03:18:00.020]  And of course, they say it's not where you're going. It's the journey. This is the test.
[03:18:00.020 --> 03:18:05.860]  We really do have free will. That's why all of this has happened. I mean, God creates
[03:18:05.860 --> 03:18:11.180]  the us, creates us noses before we're in our womb, but it is the free will. And people
[03:18:11.180 --> 03:18:14.580]  say, well, God's God, God already knows this is going to happen. It doesn't matter. It
[03:18:14.580 --> 03:18:22.820]  sets the system in motion, and within that is the free will. And it depends on what we
[03:18:22.820 --> 03:18:30.420]  do. Much of the course of things within that stream, God has basically fordain. It's so
[03:18:30.420 --> 03:18:35.220]  complex. It's predestined, but it's not. I mean, do you see what I'm saying?
[03:18:35.220 --> 03:18:42.420]  You're right on. It's a we have free will within the context of God knowing exactly
[03:18:42.420 --> 03:18:48.100]  what's going to happen because he's above history. Yeah, exactly.
[03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:53.140]  Well, Fred, we've only got a minute left. Anything else you'd like to add? I'm looking
[03:18:53.140 --> 03:18:59.940]  forward to our hour long interview this Friday. Oh, just encourage people to have hope. That's
[03:18:59.940 --> 03:19:07.980]  the big goal and the big assignment that I have now from from the Lord is to get out
[03:19:07.980 --> 03:19:15.020]  there and give people hope. If people don't have hope, if they throw their hope away,
[03:19:15.020 --> 03:19:24.060]  they're not going to move forward in life. And so hopefully what's happened with me will
[03:19:24.060 --> 03:19:31.900]  be encouraging to people that they will see that in spite of being a bad set of cards
[03:19:31.900 --> 03:19:39.300]  that you can still do something with it and, you know, that they would that they would
[03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:45.220]  be encouraged and likewise, they would get out there and do something positive with
