[00:33.800 --> 00:42.200]  Fire in USA Radio News, I'm Jason Walker. New poll finds Americans support fundamental
[00:42.200 --> 00:48.200]  changes in a healthcare system and the creation of a government-run insurance plan to compete
[00:48.200 --> 00:52.440]  with private insurers. Respondents believe Uncle Sam could do a better job of holding
[00:52.440 --> 00:57.840]  down healthcare costs than a private sector driven by profit incentives. In the meantime,
[00:57.840 --> 01:02.360]  healthcare the focus Saturday in the Republicans' weekly radio address.
[01:02.360 --> 01:06.680]  Americans want healthcare reform, but they want the right healthcare reform, and that
[01:06.680 --> 01:12.960]  means taking the time and the care necessary to get it right. Against Republican advice,
[01:12.960 --> 01:19.000]  they rush the stimulus. We shouldn't rush again on something as important and costly
[01:19.000 --> 01:20.160]  as healthcare.

[02:34.080 --> 02:38.480]  The Justice Department announcing charges against Texas billionaire Alan Stanford and

[02:43.840 --> 02:49.840]  on 21 charges of fraud and obstruction stemming from a bank in Antigua. Assistant Attorney
[02:49.840 --> 02:55.880]  General Lanny Brewer details some of the frauds Stanford and his group allegedly perpetrated.
[02:55.880 --> 03:02.600]  Stanford and his co-defendants allegedly misused and misappropriated most of those investment
[03:02.600 --> 03:11.080]  assets, including diverting at least $1.6 billion into undisclosed personal loans to
[03:11.080 --> 03:15.880]  Stanford himself. Doctors say they expect Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to make
[03:15.880 --> 03:21.640]  a full recovery from her surgery for a broken right elbow. Clinton tripped and fell in the

[04:04.880 --> 04:09.280]  President Obama has issued a special proclamation for Father's Day Sunday.
[04:09.280 --> 04:14.120]  Fathers are our first teachers and coaches. They're our mentors. They're our role models.
[04:14.120 --> 04:18.920]  They set an example of success and they push us to succeed. Encourage us when we're struggling.
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.320]  They love us even when we disappoint them and they stand by us when nobody else will.
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.680]  President also urged Americans to express their gratitude to all the fathers who serve
[04:27.680 --> 04:33.200]  today in the United States military. FDA telling consumers to avoid eating Nestle
[04:33.200 --> 04:39.040]  Toll House refrigerated cookie dough because it may be contaminated with E. coli. Agency

[05:01.280 --> 05:07.760]  Decaro's are the current longest married couple in the United States. They tied the knot 80
[05:07.760 --> 05:14.280]  years ago. Both are 100 years old and say they still love each other just as much today as
[05:14.280 --> 05:19.440]  when they first met. By the way, they met at a dancing school and they worked in a vaudeville
[05:19.440 --> 05:25.160]  act before starting a family. Bill says the secret is to not stay mad at one another and
[05:25.160 --> 05:33.520]  always love one another. I'm Jason Walker. I are in USA radio news.

[07:06.120 --> 07:20.840]  Texas. Here's Alex Jones. Very important radio transmission lined up for you today. We are
[07:20.840 --> 07:28.960]  live. It is Sunday, the 21st day of June 2009. Coming up in about an hour and a half, a news
[07:28.960 --> 07:34.560]  radio 590 K L B J reporter is going to pop in for about five minutes. Sarah Hutterberg.
[07:34.560 --> 07:40.240]  I heard her going over the news just where we went live and she was pointing out the
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.520]  fact that the state of Texas, the Cattleman's Association and others are saying, Hey, we
[07:45.520 --> 07:51.160]  don't want this clean water restoration act. This will federalize all water, including
[07:51.160 --> 07:57.200]  rainwater, wells, aquifers. They are going to grab the entire supply, lakes, basically
[07:57.200 --> 08:03.240]  federal police everywhere. This is happening nationwide. And I covered this two weeks ago
[08:03.240 --> 08:08.120]  on the air a week ago and I get emails saying I'm a liar. But now here it is with state
[08:08.120 --> 08:12.920]  officials and Cattleman and other groups coming out. So she's got some of those clips that
[08:12.920 --> 08:16.640]  is coming up in an hour and a half. She's going to pop in and visit with us. Former editor
[08:16.640 --> 08:21.400]  of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy department of the treasury under Ronald
[08:21.400 --> 08:25.280]  Reagan. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has done some great research on what's really happening
[08:25.280 --> 08:33.000]  in Iran. He's scheduled to be joining us later in this radio show as well. Okay, we have
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  a very important show lined up outside of those important issues. I'm going to be breaking
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.120]  down what's really happening with North Korea. What's really happening with Iran. Why is
[08:42.120 --> 08:48.760]  this suddenly happening all over the globe? Why are police in Peru, machine gunning hundreds
[08:48.760 --> 08:54.640]  of people? Why is it happening in Iran? Why suddenly is there war in Pakistan? Why suddenly
[08:54.640 --> 09:00.160]  is a U.S. ship and a standoff with an Iranian government flagged vessel that they say has
[09:00.160 --> 09:05.200]  weapons on it? Why is North Korea saying they may go ahead and launch nuclear weapons? Why
[09:05.200 --> 09:14.600]  is this all just suddenly happening? We'll be breaking that down later in the show. But
[09:14.600 --> 09:21.560]  first off, in the stack of news in front of me, I have three stories. Some of these I
[09:21.560 --> 09:29.400]  covered this week. One of them is brand new today, exclusive to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[09:29.400 --> 09:36.080]  And you will hear about this later in mainstream media, but with their spin on it. We can really
[09:36.080 --> 09:41.040]  say you do hear a lot of it here first. We really do the great research and our listeners
[09:41.040 --> 09:45.880]  send us the best tips. It was listeners found that bill to literally seize all the water
[09:45.880 --> 09:50.400]  supplies under federal control. And remember, the feds themselves are now controlled by
[09:50.400 --> 09:57.720]  offshore private banks. And a separate issue since Monday, when they finally released the
[09:57.720 --> 10:03.600]  federal reserve reform bill, it is a total private federal reserve takeover of even the
[10:03.600 --> 10:09.440]  federal government. No bill of rights, no constitution dwarfs the Patriot Act, dwarfs
[10:09.440 --> 10:14.600]  military commissions act dwarfs even what Hitler and Stalin and Mao put on paper for
[10:14.600 --> 10:20.080]  their illegitimate powers. This is just we are God. We own and rule everything from a
[10:20.080 --> 10:29.160]  restaurant, a hot dog shack up to the car dealerships and the car manufacturers and the steel producers.
[10:29.160 --> 10:36.560]  Everything, anything dealing with the economy. No judge, no jury, no due process, no nothing.
[10:36.560 --> 10:40.640]  We started beating the drum Monday, begging listeners to force this out in the mainstream
[10:40.640 --> 10:47.040]  news. It is now mainstream news because this wasn't even going to be discussed. There wasn't
[10:47.040 --> 10:51.760]  even going to be a debate about the end of the Republic. And yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[10:51.760 --> 10:57.400]  it's actually all happening right now. As Lenin said, the evil genus that he was, there
[10:57.400 --> 11:02.000]  are times in history when more happens in a week or a month or a year than happened in
[11:02.000 --> 11:08.160]  the previous hundred years. Now, here's the first big top stories today. Remember, we
[11:08.160 --> 11:12.920]  broke the Homeland Security reports, the DHS report that made national news three months
[11:12.920 --> 11:19.120]  ago saying all gun owners are the number one threat to the government and that Homeland
[11:19.120 --> 11:25.240]  Security has set up to take on gun owners and veterans, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters,
[11:25.240 --> 11:30.360]  Bob Barr supporters, anyone who wants to control the borders. We broke that. People didn't
[11:30.360 --> 11:35.560]  believe it was real. Ron Paul's office found out it was real, said, yes, it's real. And
[11:35.560 --> 11:40.720]  it made national news and the media spun it. And we broke the MIAC report out of Missouri.
[11:40.720 --> 11:45.960]  And we literally, I'd say more than half the big news now that fights the new world orders
[11:45.960 --> 11:52.600]  coming out of me, coming out of my small office, my ragtag team. And it really freaks me out
[11:52.600 --> 11:56.640]  because it's a dangerous position to be in. And I'm not even that good. And I can't believe
[11:56.640 --> 12:01.360]  I'm in this position, but I'll tell you why it is. It's just because I read the email
[12:01.360 --> 12:06.480]  from our listeners. It's you scouring the bills, the legislation. It's you and the state police.
[12:06.480 --> 12:10.560]  It's you and the FBI that send me these documents. It's the whistleblowers. It's the
[12:10.560 --> 12:14.520]  preachers that sent me the reports that they were secretly being trained by FEMA to tell
[12:14.520 --> 12:18.400]  their flocks, to hand in their guns, to go to FEMA camps and take force inoculations
[12:18.400 --> 12:22.040]  when the time came. I got made fun of, even though I gave you the secret documents. Now
[12:22.040 --> 12:28.800]  it's mainstream news. And I don't understand why we continue to break literally hundreds
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.800]  and hundreds of the major important stories. And now I'm being attacked by international
[12:33.800 --> 12:38.480]  media. I mean, we're here on the front lines getting battered to hell, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:38.480 --> 12:42.520]  And we know most of you are supporting us, but people need to take serious the time we've
[12:42.520 --> 12:47.600]  got left on air, the time we've got left with info wars.com and prison planet.com. Do not
[12:47.600 --> 12:51.880]  take any of this for granted with the information I'm about to give you. A lot of people have
[12:51.880 --> 12:56.960]  died and been imprisoned and have been lost their jobs to bring you the information you're
[12:56.960 --> 13:01.600]  about to get. Do you understand that? Do you understand that? This isn't a game, ladies
[13:01.600 --> 13:05.920]  and gentlemen. People ask, how can I still be alive? How can I be on AM and FM stations
[13:05.920 --> 13:09.600]  across the country? Because the globalists don't have total control. They're able to
[13:09.600 --> 13:15.360]  steer society. They're able to twist society. They're able to dominate, but not fully micromanage
[13:15.360 --> 13:22.240]  and control yet. That's now happening. The iron curtain is lowering. This is, this is
[13:22.240 --> 13:25.600]  it, ladies and gentlemen. And even if you don't believe me intellectually and your
[13:25.600 --> 13:31.760]  gut, you know, things are bad. You know, we predicted all of this with precision. Now
[13:31.760 --> 13:38.000]  this broke earlier in the week. People didn't believe us. And then the ACLU came out, found
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.760]  out about it and started suing a day later. And it's now been on CNN, but CNN acts like,
[13:43.760 --> 13:48.040]  well, I guess it's reasonable. See, they'll take incredible stuff. We report and then
[13:48.040 --> 13:53.240]  make it like it's no big deal. Like, oh, yes, it is good to say veterans of the number one
[13:53.240 --> 13:56.960]  terror threat and homeland securities for them. And they have the head of veterans affairs
[13:56.960 --> 14:03.880]  come out and say, well, veterans are terrorists. And now they're having the VFWs go back and
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.000]  have to basically register and you're ready to turn in even their civil war cannons. I
[14:08.000 --> 14:15.840]  mean, this is all happening folks. Listen to this. Do D training manual, not even classified,
[14:15.840 --> 14:22.440]  describes protest as terrorism. All protest is illegal. And as an act of terrorism, protesting
[14:22.440 --> 14:29.720]  anything, a toxic waste dump in your neighborhood, illegal aliens being above the law, not being
[14:29.720 --> 14:36.720]  arrested by local police, but citizens have the book thrown at them. The war attacks
[14:36.720 --> 14:41.400]  on the second amendment. Current Department of Defense, anti-terrorism training course
[14:41.400 --> 14:46.640]  material states that the existence of first amendment rights in the US constitution constitutes
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.720]  terrorist activity. The ACLU has written the DOD regardless regarding its anti-terrorism
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.520]  and force protection annual rehearsal training course, which advises personnel that political
[14:56.520 --> 15:01.360]  protest amounts to low level terrorism. And it goes on. I'm going to read that later.
[15:01.360 --> 15:07.120]  Now this isn't the new story. I've been reporting this all week. Now confirm to be real. Look,
[15:07.120 --> 15:10.880]  we don't make any of this up. I know we break it, break it, break it, break it, break it.
[15:10.880 --> 15:17.400]  People can't believe we break all this because we know what news is folks. We go through
[15:17.400 --> 15:21.840]  our tips. We go through the stuff that millions of listeners feed us. And people now know
[15:21.840 --> 15:28.000]  we're the place to send the documents. We're the place to send the leads. Most of it declassified.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.960]  Just publicly training the military that there's no more First Amendment in America. Now listen
[15:31.960 --> 15:38.880]  to this. I told you about this. This is in the Obama deception released three months
[15:38.880 --> 15:46.640]  ago, done four months ago. This is in the Obama deception. I talk about this every week
[15:46.640 --> 15:51.960]  on the show. It is now in the New York times. So now it's real. So now we can talk about
[15:51.960 --> 16:00.920]  it. This is the New York times Friday. Our story about it has a link to it. Proposed
[16:00.920 --> 16:06.240]  law allows AG attorney general Holder to block gun sales to over a million Americans. The
[16:06.240 --> 16:14.800]  bill is no fly, no buy, no judge, no jury, a million, 100,000 plus. Now it's a million
[16:14.800 --> 16:21.160]  200,000 million, 200,000. It grows by 25,000 every month. And then that's not even the
[16:21.160 --> 16:26.960]  big news. That's not even the big news. When I get back, I'm going to give you the big
[16:26.960 --> 16:33.760]  one. Stay with us.

[17:41.520 --> 17:46.560]  mind movie. We're surrounded by gestures, members of the nation's largest clown club
[17:46.560 --> 17:52.280]  based in Washington DC, fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes and now offering financial
[17:52.280 --> 17:57.360]  assurances that all will be well. The stimulus package is working, a bailout is coming your
[17:57.360 --> 18:01.640]  way and while we're flat broke we're also told that we've stepped back away from the
[18:01.640 --> 18:06.960]  brink, pardon me, back to the real world. We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves
[18:06.960 --> 18:11.880]  to generate financial security. Protecting your assets is solely up to you, no one else
[18:11.880 --> 18:18.440]  is coming to the rescue. Please call me John Swenson 800-686-2237 extension 128 to discuss
[18:18.440 --> 18:23.200]  investing in precious metals, gold and silver with a 6,000 year track record of success
[18:23.200 --> 18:30.040]  and security. I'm John Swenson 800-686-2237 extension 128 and together we'll create a
[18:30.040 --> 18:34.320]  package that really works for you.
[18:34.320 --> 18:39.960]  Today we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country, the economy, job layoffs,
[18:39.960 --> 18:45.840]  mass foreclosures and now we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[18:45.840 --> 18:49.880]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United

[19:33.720 --> 19:38.640]  The phone rings and the questions are asked. I've been so sick, will a life change tea
[19:38.640 --> 19:45.240]  help me? Our answer is always the same. Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air
[19:45.240 --> 19:51.300]  are attacking you this very moment. Fight back with our all natural detoxifying tea

[20:02.680 --> 20:08.600]  over 20 years. There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[20:08.600 --> 20:13.640]  The public has reached its all time record for chronic sickness. This atrocity won't
[20:13.640 --> 20:25.240]  change unless you call us right now. Our number is 928-308-0408. Again, that's 928-308-0408

[20:31.480 --> 20:38.240]  the cheapest shipping in the industry. Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[20:38.240 --> 20:48.680]  Which no more, we are the GCN Radio Network. Ladies and gentlemen, when I get up here on
[20:48.680 --> 20:56.800]  the radio and I tell you that they are training Northcom to confiscate your guns, it's because
[20:56.800 --> 21:03.320]  I knew they'd set up Northcom in the late 1990s. They didn't set up Northcom in 2002.
[21:03.320 --> 21:10.560]  Bill Clinton was giving speeches to Northcom in 1993. It is the military jurisdiction over
[21:10.560 --> 21:16.080]  the United States controlling the American people. And now the John Warner Defense Authorization
[21:16.080 --> 21:20.840]  Act of 2007 states their job is to take on the American people and the governors and
[21:20.840 --> 21:24.960]  the states. And now the feds are openly announcing they're federalizing all the water and are
[21:24.960 --> 21:31.320]  basically take people's property if they want it. So everywhere in the east and the south
[21:31.320 --> 21:35.560]  that isn't under federal control like they are in the west, we now are going to be because
[21:35.560 --> 21:43.280]  they're announcing a buffer zone of three times the size of the waterway on either side
[21:43.280 --> 21:46.200]  where they can come on your property without warrants, do whatever they want. That's coming
[21:46.200 --> 21:52.880]  up next hour. And that's all because we're going under IMF World Bank Receivership publicly,
[21:52.880 --> 21:59.440]  publicly. In fact, do you have that Napolitano clip ready? That's going to come up in a few
[21:59.440 --> 22:04.200]  minutes. He is now saying what I'm saying. He did this Friday. I've been saying this
[22:04.200 --> 22:08.720]  for months, obviously. In the Obama deception, I explained after they bankrupt us and steal
[22:08.720 --> 22:12.080]  tens of trillions, they will then set up a new bank of the world that will pay our carbon
[22:12.080 --> 22:16.040]  taxes to and that will then regulate us. How do I know? I'm reading their official documents.
[22:16.040 --> 22:22.240]  Now it's been announced, but it's worse than I thought. Worse than I thought. They're bypassing
[22:22.240 --> 22:28.920]  even the illusion of freedom and signing deals with this private offshore bank in treaties.
[22:28.920 --> 22:32.560]  They're going to have the private Federal Reserve, its regional governorship, its holding
[22:32.560 --> 22:38.000]  company, openly be above all laws and do whatever it wants. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, you
[22:38.000 --> 22:44.680]  think they've stolen $14.8 trillion more than the GDP in eight months, seven months? This
[22:44.680 --> 22:50.640]  is worse than I even thought. I am shaking right now. They are definitely going for
[22:50.640 --> 22:55.320]  absolute broke. This is it. This is the total complete takeover. They're going to stage
[22:55.320 --> 23:00.440]  massive terror attacks, but I'll tell you this. The good news is the people are waking
[23:00.440 --> 23:04.280]  up and then they're getting ready to do the Sunday syndicated show. It's really growing
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.080]  by the way. And I'm listening to Dr. Dina Dell, who I've interviewed before. He's a different
[23:08.080 --> 23:13.880]  cat when he's on your show and he knows who I am. And a caller calls and he goes, yeah,
[23:13.880 --> 23:16.800]  I heard David Rockefeller wants to reduce world population and the government dug
[23:16.800 --> 23:22.640]  up a dead whaler to get the old 1918 Spanish flu that killed 40 million people. He said,
[23:22.640 --> 23:26.480]  it's conspiracy theory, isn't real. You couldn't hide something like that. That's been in the
[23:26.480 --> 23:32.520]  Journal of Science, London Guardian, ABC News reported two weeks ago, world's rich meet
[23:32.520 --> 23:38.520]  in secret meeting to call for population reduction. I mean, in fact, Paul Hartman right now just
[23:38.520 --> 23:46.240]  Google rich, the exact headline from the Guardian that was a really in depth one was world's
[23:46.240 --> 23:51.800]  richest meet to discuss population reduction. Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Dina. I happen to have
[23:51.800 --> 23:57.920]  the actual articles with them saying it themselves. Oh, but it's a conspiracy theory. Okay, well,
[23:57.920 --> 24:04.480]  proposed law allows A.G. Holder to block gun sales to over a million Americans. And I've
[24:04.480 --> 24:08.840]  been given this bill number out for months and months. Now, in fact, the chief of staff
[24:08.840 --> 24:13.920]  of the White House introduced this last year when he was still in the Congress, Rahm Emanuel.
[24:13.920 --> 24:19.200]  And I've given all those bill numbers on air. And the media is pushing and saying it's a
[24:19.200 --> 24:25.520]  good thing. This is guilty until proven innocent. You have absolutely no rights, no liberties,
[24:25.520 --> 24:29.680]  no freedom. There's no way to get off the list. This is like we're in a yellow star
[24:29.680 --> 24:33.760]  in Nazi Germany, where you can't have businesses, can't buy, can't sell and Homeland Security
[24:33.760 --> 24:39.220]  says you're on that list. And the criminal list is over four million under Patriot Act
[24:39.220 --> 24:45.360]  compliance for every car dealership, banks, car rentals, hotels, jobs, everything. When
[24:45.360 --> 24:50.000]  you have bad credit, you're going to be on the no fly list. Anything. Somebody doesn't
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  like you. You're going to be on it. It's a chilling effect. And it's, and the bill is
[24:54.000 --> 25:01.440]  called the no fly, no buy. And they had 25,000 people a month to it. Three or four months
[25:01.440 --> 25:09.800]  ago, it was 1,100,000. That means it's over 1,200,000. Now that's mainstream news, New
[25:09.800 --> 25:13.880]  York times, but they're saying it's a good idea. We're going to have a new class of
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.000]  American where no judge, no cheerleaders on a list. And the feds come in and take your
[25:18.000 --> 25:23.800]  farmer ranch and say, you can't use it. If rainwater hits it, that's what the bill says.
[25:23.800 --> 25:30.040]  Rainwater. And that's not even me. I'm listening to the local news people doing, covering that
[25:30.040 --> 25:36.440]  on record during the breaks. This is really all happening, ladies and gentlemen. And that
[25:36.440 --> 25:44.880]  isn't enough for you. Here's the newest one. This is the newest report. This is up on info
[25:44.880 --> 25:49.400]  wars.com and prison planet.com. We are breaking this just like we broke the Homeland Security
[25:49.400 --> 25:53.640]  report, the mic report saying all veterans, all gun owners of the number one threat, Homeland
[25:53.640 --> 25:59.160]  Security North comm is designed for you so that the criminal foreign banks can secure
[25:59.160 --> 26:03.120]  their takeover. They're here to babysit you with a baton and a machine gun upside the
[26:03.120 --> 26:07.560]  head. And to make sure this, this heist takes place properly. Of course, the cops don't
[26:07.560 --> 26:14.040]  know that. Virginia state police say anti new world order and gun rights activist or
[26:14.040 --> 26:17.400]  terrorist. And I've read this report. This was federally written. It's like I told you
[26:17.400 --> 26:21.240]  the state police report in Missouri, the mic report was federally written and that came
[26:21.240 --> 26:26.040]  out later. It was because I've read the federal reports, but this says gun rights activist
[26:26.040 --> 26:32.880]  are terrorist and tells the state police go read it to go ahead and take in for questioning.
[26:32.880 --> 26:38.800]  You see somebody with a get us out of the UN sticker, take them to jail. That's right
[26:38.800 --> 26:44.040]  because the UN is the receivership body to take this country over. And cops, when you
[26:44.040 --> 26:47.880]  lose your pension fund, everything you got, just remember you help the new world order
[26:47.880 --> 26:53.920]  and you pimp judges and the sell out congressmen we've got and the state senators, all of you.
[26:53.920 --> 27:01.840]  We are being absolutely usurped right now. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming up. But
[27:01.840 --> 27:07.960]  again, DoD training manual describes all protests as terrorism. The actual training
[27:07.960 --> 27:14.320]  manual is up on info wars.com and prison planet.com right now. And mainstream news is reporting
[27:14.320 --> 27:17.880]  it like it's normal going. Oh, yes, protesting is now terrorism. Ladies and gentlemen, this
[27:17.880 --> 27:22.800]  government is completely rogue. Let's go ahead and start playing Napolitano because well,
[27:22.800 --> 27:32.680]  we'll play when we come back because because I want you to understand something. Monday,
[27:32.680 --> 27:36.840]  Tuesday, Wednesday on the show I got on the air and this isn't about me getting credit.
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.080]  It's about you getting credit and it's about showing people there's a chance to fight these
[27:41.080 --> 27:51.520]  monsters off. Listen to me very, very carefully. I went on air and I said you got to break
[27:51.520 --> 27:55.880]  this this story nationally that they're secretly hired 20 plus thousand preachers to tell their
[27:55.880 --> 27:59.800]  flocks to turn their guns in to go to FEMA camps and render into Caesar. Secretly, they're
[27:59.800 --> 28:06.160]  not supposed to tell the the practitioners or the the something right word, the the the
[28:06.160 --> 28:10.280]  parishioners, not practitioners, the parishioners, you're not supposed to tell them they're
[28:10.280 --> 28:15.840]  on secret government payroll. This is the Reuters is reporting the CIA is recruiting
[28:15.840 --> 28:21.360]  your local bankers to spy on you. That's completely illegal. They're running CIA ads on radio
[28:21.360 --> 28:28.200]  and TV everywhere. This is a total takeover of America. The Pentagon, the CIA all worked
[28:28.200 --> 28:33.760]  for offshore banks. It's a big joke. We're being hijacked. This is a corporate takeover,
[28:33.760 --> 28:38.800]  but this is what's positive. I got on the air and ranted and raved and beat my brains
[28:38.800 --> 28:44.880]  out and now finally a few mainstream outlets are reporting that it is a total Federal Reserve
[28:44.880 --> 28:50.640]  dictatorship and now we've got a chance to beat it because you spread the word and you
[28:50.640 --> 28:54.640]  took the articles that Paul Watson and Steve Watson wrote like Obama regulatory reform
[28:54.640 --> 29:00.080]  plan officially establishes banking dictatorship in the United States. Steve wrote this other
[29:00.080 --> 29:03.920]  article financial dictatorship spreads to Europe, the very same system. It's the same
[29:03.920 --> 29:10.640]  shareholders, same system being set up there. They're now, you know, the politicians told
[29:10.640 --> 29:13.760]  me he listens to the show and so does his producer and I'm honored that he basically
[29:13.760 --> 29:18.200]  word for word took what I said, did the research himself as a former federal judge and did
[29:18.200 --> 29:24.320]  a report on Fox News. But that's coming up when we get back. But there's a wrinkle to
[29:24.320 --> 29:28.960]  it that will break down as well, but we've got to beat them. If we tell the public foreign
[29:28.960 --> 29:34.400]  banks are hijacking, we've got a chance to beat them. Stay with us. Did you know many
[29:34.400 --> 29:39.800]  vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[29:39.800 --> 29:43.920]  Think about that. Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach? Our body
[29:43.920 --> 29:49.560]  wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells. Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator

[34:01.640 --> 34:06.240]  phones. We've got Sarah Hutterberg, the News Radio 590KLBJ reporter coming in with some
[34:06.240 --> 34:10.840]  of the clips of state officials and the head of the Cattleman's Association here in Texas,
[34:10.840 --> 34:15.280]  but it's all over the country talking about the feds to control all rainwater, all puddles,
[34:15.280 --> 34:21.280]  all ponds, come on your property, no warrants, regulations control. That all ties in to just
[34:21.280 --> 34:26.680]  the total federal takeover. But first, before we go to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, I want to
[34:26.680 --> 34:30.400]  have him hear this. Now, again, we sort of cover in this Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday that
[34:30.400 --> 34:35.200]  Ron Paul came in and said, yes, the bill does set up a financial dictatorship for the private
[34:35.200 --> 34:41.160]  Federal Reserve. Now, Napolitano, I think in two minutes, really sums it up for people
[34:41.160 --> 34:45.400]  out there that aren't aware of this because there's hardly any news coverage of the so
[34:45.400 --> 34:49.600]  called Federal Reserve reform. I mean, there's lots of coverage of it. People are talking
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.200]  about it, but they're saying we have to have it or we're all dead. Give the bankers that
[34:53.200 --> 34:59.080]  cause the crisis more power. And then meanwhile, when you actually look at the bill, well,
[34:59.080 --> 35:04.520]  I think Napolitano breaks it down. So here it is. I'm Judge Andrew Napolitano and the
[35:04.520 --> 35:10.360]  verdict is coming on President Barack Obama's historic plan to overhaul and regulator of
[35:10.360 --> 35:15.680]  financial institutions. Here's the question. What is left out of this proposal is and what
[35:15.680 --> 35:21.360]  we deserve to know is who will regulate the Federal Reserve? What will become of clauses
[35:21.360 --> 35:26.960]  in the Constitution that prohibit the very type of regulation the president wants? And
[35:26.960 --> 35:33.880]  what is now the meaning of the word free in free market? Here are the facts. The bias
[35:33.880 --> 35:39.020]  of the drafters of this proposal is that the government knows best. The Constitution should
[35:39.020 --> 35:44.960]  not be an obstacle to the egalitarian goals of the government and no private behavior
[35:44.960 --> 35:50.400]  is beyond the government's reach of its huge hand. The essence of the proposal is to give
[35:50.400 --> 35:56.760]  the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate any aspect of any firms that in its discretion,
[35:56.760 --> 36:02.480]  its sole discretion could adversely affect the economy if they fail. The Fed would thus
[36:02.480 --> 36:11.080]  be the only unregulated private entity on the planet. This private, super secret bank,
[36:11.080 --> 36:16.760]  half of whose board is appointed by the president, is the most secret aspect in all of the government.
[36:16.760 --> 36:23.320]  Think about it. The job of the CIA is to steal and to keep secrets, but we know more about
[36:23.320 --> 36:30.280]  the CIA than we do the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is a private, completely unregulated
[36:30.280 --> 36:37.640]  bank into which the Obama administration proposes to repose all regulatory authority from the
[36:37.640 --> 36:44.440]  compensation of executives to the investments companies make to the location of their franchises.
[36:44.440 --> 36:51.080]  Are you ready for this? To the amount of fat in McDonald's cheeseburgers without appeal
[36:51.080 --> 36:57.400]  and without stating reasons for the regulations. All grouped investments, even if the investors
[36:57.400 --> 37:02.360]  own the group like hedge funds, like you and your neighbors getting together to buy a house,
[37:02.360 --> 37:07.680]  will be subject to the Fed's new rules. All state chartered banks will now be subject
[37:07.680 --> 37:14.360]  to the Fed. All businesses, whether financial in nature or not, that are owned by any financial
[37:14.360 --> 37:22.280]  institutions shall be subject to the Fed. Even mom and pop shops and stores, if in the Fed's
[37:22.280 --> 37:29.960]  opinion could fail and thus produce systemic harm to the economy, shall be subject to the
[37:29.960 --> 37:34.520]  rule of the Fed. All right. And it goes on from there. It's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[37:34.520 --> 37:40.440]  Now, I would add, I go on this show with Napolitano a few times and he comes on mine. It's an
[37:40.440 --> 37:45.000]  internet show. People keep thinking I'm on Fox. No, they're not putting me on Fox. They know
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.040]  everybody already knows on the internet. So they'll have this on the internet program that people
[37:50.040 --> 37:57.000]  think watching it is on Fox TV. It's not. Why isn't this on Fox television when Napolitano is on
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.400]  there? See, that's why we're pushing to make sure people at least know what's happening. Dr. Paul
[38:01.400 --> 38:06.040]  Craig Roberts is a bestselling author. His latest book and it's a newest edition is The
[38:06.040 --> 38:10.680]  Tyranny of Good Intentions, getting into the whole police state control grid in the courts.
[38:10.680 --> 38:15.800]  And he, of course, is a former Wall Street Journal editor, the head of policy, number two,
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.920]  the father of Reaganomics under Ronald Reagan. And so he can speak briefly to what's happening
[38:20.920 --> 38:25.640]  with the economy. Then I want to get into why he's really here. I ran. He's written some of the most
[38:25.640 --> 38:30.120]  in depth and insightful articles we've seen about what's really happening there. Dr. Paul Craig
[38:30.120 --> 38:34.760]  Roberts, always great to have you with us. Thank you, Alex. Okay. You just heard Napolitano. I'm
[38:34.760 --> 38:40.120]  sure you're aware of this overhaul. What's your take on that? Well, the Federal Reserve has been
[38:40.120 --> 38:46.360]  such a total failure with less powers. Why would they want to give it more? You know, it was supposed
[38:46.360 --> 38:53.160]  to be the lend of last resort and prevent a contraction of the banking system. It failed. We
[38:53.160 --> 39:01.000]  had the Great Depression. It's supposed to have a stable, maintain a stable currency. It's failed.
[39:01.000 --> 39:09.000]  We've had amazing inflation in the post-World War II period. And it had completely failed in its
[39:09.000 --> 39:17.800]  regulatory obligations. So why give it more regulatory power? Especially the kinds of powers
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.320]  that we just heard the judge describe, which have nothing to do with the original Fed charter. So
[39:23.320 --> 39:31.960]  I simply have to assume that something's afoot again. They're pulling another fast one on us,
[39:31.960 --> 39:39.000]  and they have some other agenda. Well, I agree with you. And imagine if the FBI or the courts or
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.560]  the Congress or the President said, and I've read the bill, it's actually worse than Napolitano said.
[39:43.560 --> 39:48.520]  It said anything that affects the financial structure we can take over, it's even worse. It's
[39:48.520 --> 39:53.640]  even worse. It's everything. And then we've got this water bill that's about to pass the Senate,
[39:54.280 --> 40:02.920]  S787. And this thing allows the feds to own, quote, all water supplies, including wells,
[40:02.920 --> 40:09.080]  rainwater, ponds, aquifers. I mean, my God, this is getting, I can't even believe this, Dr. Roberts.
[40:09.880 --> 40:15.240]  Yeah, well, it is an amazing grab of power. And while they're doing that, it's not clear
[40:15.240 --> 40:25.320]  either. I do know some years back when they were prosecuting people for building on lots for which
[40:25.320 --> 40:31.560]  they had state permits, and the feds would come in and say, no, there's a wetland. And they were
[40:31.560 --> 40:38.920]  using this bill that had determined the navigable waters of the United States. Well, of course,
[40:38.920 --> 40:45.880]  puddles aren't navigable waters. Neither little streams, neither are ranchers and farmers clearing
[40:45.880 --> 40:51.880]  out their drainage ditches. But they use that to regulate all of this. And finally, the point was
[40:51.880 --> 40:58.920]  made, this was a huge overreach. And the Clinton administration said, well, we won't punish the
[40:58.920 --> 41:05.080]  government for abusing its power. We'll just amend the law to reflect what they're doing.
[41:05.080 --> 41:13.080]  And so it could be that that was the origin of this notion, to give the federal government
[41:13.800 --> 41:21.960]  claim over mud puddles and rainwater, so that they would, to just sort of make
[41:23.080 --> 41:28.280]  legal what they were already doing under the navigable water interpretation. But why they
[41:28.280 --> 41:36.280]  would want all this power or what they would do with it? I just, I mean, we're starting to get
[41:36.280 --> 41:45.080]  into the, to the realm of, of, you know, police state science fiction. Absolutely. Well, when
[41:45.080 --> 41:49.320]  Mr. Police State Science Fiction, Alex Jones is starting to think I'm in the twilight zone,
[41:49.320 --> 41:54.440]  we must be in trouble because I mean, I can't believe how fast this is moving. Shifting gears
[41:54.440 --> 41:58.920]  into the main reason we have you here. Again, you're a real conservative, you know, who Ronald
[41:58.920 --> 42:03.080]  Reagan credited as being the father of Reaganomics, biggest boom we've had in, you know, really the
[42:03.080 --> 42:09.800]  last 50, 60 years versus the fake conservatism of George Bush. You criticized him when Obama came
[42:09.800 --> 42:14.120]  in. And you were hopeful, but you've since, for those that haven't read your writings said,
[42:14.120 --> 42:21.080]  it looks like he may be even worse if that's possible. And then everything Obama says,
[42:21.080 --> 42:25.560]  he says, no lobbyist, all he hires is lobbyist. He says, I'm going to end the wars. He expands
[42:25.560 --> 42:31.080]  the wars. He says, I'm going to end the indefinite detention and torture. He expands it. And so
[42:31.080 --> 42:35.960]  when I saw him say he wants to be friends with Iran, I said, look out, covert operations,
[42:35.960 --> 42:41.560]  Bush's White House, I'm just filling folks in, admits they had covert operations going on to
[42:41.560 --> 42:48.520]  destabilize Iran. Obama has admitted that. Clearly they're in there trying to foment things. I don't
[42:48.520 --> 42:55.480]  know who won the election either way. But certainly I agree with that. The articles you've been
[42:56.120 --> 43:02.280]  writing for your syndicated column that regardless, our media is using this as a way
[43:02.280 --> 43:08.520]  to get the American people behind attacking Iran. So can you break down the facts? And
[43:08.520 --> 43:11.320]  plus what you predicted days ago has now come out and we come back.
[43:11.320 --> 43:21.240]  We've got to break, Dr. Okay. But what you said has now come true. BBC has had to retract and
[43:21.240 --> 43:26.360]  admit they were putting up fake photos showing Ahmed Denizine supporters and saying they were
[43:26.360 --> 43:30.760]  supporters of the other guy. That's now been confirmed. And I saw you say that first. We'll
[43:30.760 --> 43:37.080]  be right back. Stay with us. You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful and natural

[47:37.480 --> 47:49.800]  hard-hitting talk radio. GCN Great Talk Radio starts here. I'm looking at the London Guardian
[47:49.800 --> 47:54.600]  headline right now. British woman arrested in prison for asking cop for badge number.
[47:54.600 --> 47:59.480]  Shows them choking her and beating her and the police are saying that's the new policy. You
[47:59.480 --> 48:05.480]  ask us a question we beat you. We'll talk to Dr. Roberts about that. His new book covers it.
[48:05.480 --> 48:09.400]  The issue here is we've seen this in society over and over again. The reason I bring it up as we
[48:09.400 --> 48:14.360]  get into Iran is I don't support the moolahs. I know governments tend to get corrupt and evil
[48:14.360 --> 48:18.920]  and bad. The point is is that our government has overthrown them in 53 for people that don't know
[48:18.920 --> 48:23.400]  and Dr. Roberts can speak to that. The issue is they're in there fomenting this revolution.
[48:23.960 --> 48:31.320]  This guy's got connections to the CIA and MI6. We've clearly got color revolutions in there for
[48:31.320 --> 48:37.240]  people that don't know and if the globalists are able to bring down Iran, that's going to
[48:37.240 --> 48:43.560]  embolden them to attack more nations. That's my point here. Dr. Roberts, I saw him three,
[48:43.560 --> 48:48.920]  four days ago, write editorials and he'd show photos pointing out why are these Iranians wearing
[48:48.920 --> 48:55.480]  green for the opposition candidate holding up signs that are in English. They look westernized
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.640]  and he went back through some of the history. It's now come out. They are staging rallies.
[48:59.640 --> 49:06.040]  They are staging photos. They got caught. The BBC, as I just said, had to retract. They were
[49:06.040 --> 49:12.920]  showing photos of people that were really supporters of Ahmed Denizide and then cropping
[49:12.920 --> 49:18.840]  the photos to deceive people. So there's all sorts of chicanery. In fact, I'm not defending the
[49:18.840 --> 49:24.280]  security forces there, but if you watch those videos on YouTube carefully, there are people
[49:24.280 --> 49:29.160]  firing at the police, attacking their positions, burning cars and the police are firing back.
[49:29.160 --> 49:34.920]  So all I'm saying is there's deception going on and I've seen Fox News saying and CNN,
[49:34.920 --> 49:39.560]  oh, we ought to help the Iranians. We ought to give them support. We ought to try to overthrow them.
[49:39.560 --> 49:43.880]  That's deception, folks. The White House admits and the last White House admits
[49:43.880 --> 49:48.920]  they're in there manipulating this. They are in there pushing this. So why don't they just be
[49:49.720 --> 49:56.200]  honest? Dr. Roberts. Well, let me just give some facts. This is not anything to do with my opinion.
[49:56.200 --> 50:05.720]  We've known since May of 2007 from ABC News, from the London Telegraph, from Seymour Hirsch,
[50:05.720 --> 50:14.440]  the New Yorker, that President Bush had signed an authorization for a black ops
[50:16.360 --> 50:25.000]  group to destabilize the Iranian government and to topple it. So they've had that for
[50:25.000 --> 50:31.880]  two years and they've had an open-ended budget. We also know there are press reports that we
[50:31.880 --> 50:42.120]  have been funding not merely politically distant groups, but also terrorist groups, MEK, MEK,
[50:42.120 --> 50:50.360]  for example, groups that are or were before we began supporting them on the State Department's
[50:50.360 --> 50:56.440]  list of terrorist organizations. And we know recently there have been bombings and assassinations
[50:57.640 --> 51:02.200]  in Iran carried out by these terrorist groups that we fund.
[51:04.680 --> 51:12.600]  So we know that there is this operation going. It's been going for two years. We also
[51:12.600 --> 51:22.200]  know, for example, that the National Endowment for Democracy funds
[51:23.720 --> 51:30.840]  distant groups in countries that we want to control, where we want to orchestrate a revolution,
[51:30.840 --> 51:43.800]  a color revolution. And recently, the Arch Neoconservative, Kenneth Timmerman,
[51:45.000 --> 51:56.360]  who has an organization called Foundation for Democracy. It's funded by the National
[51:56.360 --> 52:02.280]  Endowment for Democracy. And the purpose of Timmerman's organization is to promote democracy
[52:02.280 --> 52:12.600]  in Iran. Now, here's what he wrote prior to the election. He wrote, this is before anybody has
[52:12.600 --> 52:19.320]  voted in Iran, there's talk of a green revolution in Tehran. Well, now, how would he know that?
[52:19.320 --> 52:27.320]  Unless it was orchestrated plan. Why would there be a green revolution prepared prior to the vote,
[52:27.960 --> 52:34.760]  especially if Musavi and his supporters were as confident of victory as they claim? In other words,
[52:35.560 --> 52:45.560]  this was all set up in advance. And Timmerman goes on to say that the National Endowment for
[52:45.560 --> 52:51.960]  Democracy, these direct quotes, has spent millions of dollars promoting color revolutions. So that
[52:51.960 --> 52:58.840]  money appears to have made it into the hands of pro-Musavi groups who have ties to non-governmental
[52:58.840 --> 53:05.560]  organizations outside Iran that the National Endowment for Democracy funds. So there we have it.
[53:05.560 --> 53:11.640]  It's no doubt that we're funding these people, including terrorists. Absolutely, Dr. And that's
[53:11.640 --> 53:16.360]  why your articles that we're having links to up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and up on
[53:16.360 --> 53:21.720]  counterpunch.org and others are so important. But I'd like you to go back before you continue and
[53:21.720 --> 53:26.200]  we've got one more segment with you after the news and we appreciate the time. And it's this,
[53:27.000 --> 53:33.160]  on record, Sy Hirsch actually in 2004 wrote that U.S. forces were in their staging terror attacks.
[53:33.160 --> 53:39.400]  Special forces were on the ground that they had four groups, one Kurdish, three connected to
[53:39.400 --> 53:46.680]  Saudi Arabia, the Sunnis, including the number three in Al Qaeda. This is mainstream news,
[53:46.680 --> 53:51.560]  blowing up mosques, bombing police stations. The Iranians have been suing the U.S. at the U.N.
[53:51.560 --> 53:55.400]  saying that our government's staging this. And then the White House, as you mentioned,
[53:55.400 --> 54:01.720]  in 2007 puts out a press release bragging they're doing it. And then I'm watching people last night
[54:01.720 --> 54:07.080]  on Fox News. I'm going to play a clip up next segment, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen bragging
[54:07.080 --> 54:12.760]  about how they need to torture people and invade Iran. Then he goes on Fox to run Black Ops and
[54:12.760 --> 54:18.600]  the American people and says, I'm angry at Obama. He's not supporting the overthrow in these great
[54:18.600 --> 54:25.080]  freedom fighters, knowing the whole thing's run by Bush and now still Obama, cynical Black Ops
[54:25.080 --> 54:32.040]  behaving as if this whole thing is at stage while Al Qaeda is attacking Iran when we're losing all
[54:32.040 --> 54:39.560]  our freedoms because of Al Qaeda. Yeah. Well, you've got it. You've got it figured out. And I think
[54:39.560 --> 54:47.640]  there's so many dead giveaways. For example, Musavi declared his victory several hours before
[54:47.640 --> 54:54.440]  the polls. Oh, yes. I remember that. Now, see, this is classic CIA destabilization
[54:54.440 --> 55:00.600]  because it discredits a contrary outcome and it forces an early declaration of the vote because
[55:00.600 --> 55:06.600]  along with the time interval between the preemptive declaration of victory and the release of the
[55:06.600 --> 55:12.680]  vote tally, the longer Musavi and the CIA have to create the impression that the authorities are
[55:12.680 --> 55:18.200]  using the time to fix the vote. And it's just amazing to me. People don't see through this trick.
[55:19.160 --> 55:23.400]  Well, that's really a key point. And when I saw your article yesterday, I went and looked that up
[55:23.400 --> 55:32.360]  and it's even an Iranian press TV and BBC. You're right. Hours and hours before it was even completed,
[55:32.360 --> 55:37.800]  he was already declaring victory and saying he'd won by this giant margin. How could he know
[55:37.800 --> 55:45.720]  to put out the false idea that then when he lost, it was a cheat? Yeah, that's the way you work it.
[55:46.680 --> 55:50.040]  And there's some other telltale things, for example.
[55:50.040 --> 55:54.440]  Well, it's based on a color. That's what George Soros always does. It's mindless.
[55:54.440 --> 56:02.600]  Alex, let me get the point made. You know, according to the Iranian experts that we have,
[56:02.600 --> 56:09.960]  there's no real difference between Musavi and Ahmadinejad. And the notion this guy is a moderate
[56:09.960 --> 56:17.960]  is absurd because, look, first of all, there's no history of large-scale election fraud in the
[56:17.960 --> 56:26.360]  Iranian presidential races. If the Mullahs don't like a candidate, they just kick him off the ballot.
[56:27.880 --> 56:32.440]  So if they were worried about Musavi winning and didn't want him to win, they just wouldn't
[56:32.440 --> 56:40.280]  have put him on the ballot. Who gets on the ballot is up to that council, that small council of
[56:40.280 --> 56:48.840]  Mullahs to choose. And so, obviously, they didn't have any objections to him. And when Qatami,
[56:48.840 --> 56:54.200]  a liberal former, ran for president, the entire conservative establishment absolutely hated him.
[56:55.240 --> 57:02.360]  But they did nothing about it. He won both of his races. And if they don't cheat against a liberal
[57:02.360 --> 57:07.240]  outsider like Qatami, how in the world would they cheat against a pillar of the establishment like
[57:07.240 --> 57:17.240]  Musavi? So the whole thing is, I think, that Musavi got disgruntled. The CIA knows how to manipulate
[57:18.440 --> 57:24.920]  disgruntled people. And they're using him to discredit the Iranian government.
[57:26.840 --> 57:30.920]  I don't think they'll be able to topple it because it seems to be mainly
[57:30.920 --> 57:37.880]  Western-ized youth in Tehran making these protests. But whether they topple or not,
[57:37.880 --> 57:44.360]  they've won because they will have discredited the Iranian government. The Ayatollahs thought this
[57:44.360 --> 57:52.280]  election would increase the foreign legitimacy of the regime. Instead, it's decreased it. So
[57:52.920 --> 57:58.920]  now, Obama has a reason to say, well, we were going to do diplomacy, but it's failed. Look,
[57:58.920 --> 58:05.720]  they're crooks. They steal elections. And there's nothing left but sanctions and the military option.
[58:06.360 --> 58:13.480]  And John Bolton told, according to the London Telegraph, who printed this. Hold on. Got a break.
[58:13.480 --> 58:17.480]  We'll come back after the news. I got to interrupt you, and we'll get to this incredible info
[58:17.480 --> 58:23.000]  from Dr. Paul Craig Roberts laying out every piece of information. This is completely staged, folks.

[1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:48.280]  morning when armed robbers hit a crowded Denny's restaurant. One employee shot and killed two
[1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:54.200]  people now in custody, but some witnesses say anywhere from two to six men barged into that
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:59.400]  restaurant. One worker has been killed, three others injured in an ammonia leak at a poultry

[1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:29.640]  led them to find the felony warrant for her arrest in connection with the killing of an alleged gang

[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:28.120]  more straight ahead as we chronicle the out of control tyranny of the offshore global crime
[1:07:28.120 --> 1:07:33.960]  syndicate known as the New World Order. All right. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, again, head of policy
[1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:38.520]  in the Treasury Department for Ronald Reagan, former Wall Street Journal editor, syndicated
[1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:44.040]  columnist, author of the new book. It's now out in the second edition, the tyranny of good intentions.
[1:07:44.040 --> 1:07:49.640]  I interjected some of that last segment. So in this final segment, the 10 minutes we have with you,
[1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:53.240]  can you recap all those incredible points and then you were getting to the punchline
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:59.320]  with Bolton, the Bush's ambassador to the UN bragging. And I noticed Dr. Jerome Corsi,
[1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:03.880]  who I've interviewed, suddenly didn't want to attack Iran a few years ago. He said, oh no,
[1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:08.760]  we're going to overthrow it with these great young people. And so yeah, they're pretty public about
[1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:15.080]  this. Yeah. Listen, let me just, it gives more information than I'll try to. Sure, go ahead.
[1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:22.280]  All right. The London Telegraph reported on May 16th, 2007, that they had had an editorial meeting
[1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:29.880]  with John Bolton, you know, the neocon warmonger in the Bush administration. And the Telegraph says
[1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:36.120]  that Bolton told them that a US military attack on Iran would be a last option
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:44.920]  after attempts to format a popular revolution had failed. So it's quite clear that that's,
[1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:52.600]  this is the American hand. I think it's also clear that some of these young people are very
[1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:57.720]  sincere. They're, they're, they're secularized. They're westernized. They're trying to free
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:09:05.480]  themselves from the Islamic moral codes so they can be like teenagers and young people in the
[1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:13.480]  United States. And, and so, but they're being, you know, they're serving the CIA's purpose. They're
[1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:19.160]  going to end up with a puppet regime like they had before when we installed the shawl. Now,
[1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:27.000]  I also have an email from one of these, you know, hacker spammer, knowledgeable type people,
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:34.760]  and he said that he was struck by the sudden appearance of 30,000 Iran related tweets,
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:40.360]  you know, in this Twitter thing they have now, and they just suddenly jumped up and he looked
[1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:46.200]  into it and he, this is what he found, that each of these new sites had created their Twitter
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:53.480]  accounts on Saturday, June the 13th. Each had an extremely high number of tweets that's creating
[1:09:53.480 --> 1:10:01.400]  their profiles. Iran election was their most popular keyword. They were posting in English.
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:10.040]  Half of them had the exact same profile photo and they each had thousands of followers and only a
[1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:18.120]  few friends and their friends were each other. So he looks into this. He, he, he, and he narrows
[1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:26.360]  the spammers down to three of the most persistent and does further research. He finds, for example,
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:35.720]  that within hours of, of the three of these new Twitter, whatever they are, originating that
[1:10:35.720 --> 1:10:43.720]  the Jerusalem Post has a story about them. Oh, they've been, they've been up merely a few hours
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:51.320]  and already the Jerusalem Post is calling, is writing a story about them. So he concludes
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:57.800]  from the way the whole thing was structured and all that this, all of this Twitter isn't
[1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:05.240]  Israeli operation designed to put out more disinformation and get young people all over
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:12.760]  the world behind the overthrow of the, of the regime. And we know the United States did that
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:18.440]  in 1953 with the British the exact same way, but by staging terror attacks and claiming the
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:23.640]  elected president, Mohammed Mosaddek had attacked the Muslim extremists. So last time they manipulated
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:30.200]  the Muslim extremists into overthrowing time magazine, a poet liberal throwing Mosaddek out.
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:32.680]  This time they're going to use the liberals to throw the moolas out.
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:40.600]  That's, that's the, that's the plan. And you see, and there are splits among the moolas. For example,
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:49.640]  the Ahmadinejad is reported by the lying Western media to be some kind of a right wing guy that's
[1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:55.560]  in thick with the moolas. Well, the fact of the matter, he spent most of the recent presidential
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:12:03.960]  campaign, uh, campaigning against the corruption of the moolas, particular, uh, the one he beat
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:13.480]  in the last election. This is Raf Sanjani, which, who is Musavi's main backer. So, so the moolas,
[1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:21.640]  most of the moolas are against Ahmadinejad because he has brought these corruption charges.
[1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:26.040]  You see, people in the countryside think the moolas have too much wealth and power and their
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:31.640]  lifestyle reflects it. Well, they do. Yeah. And, and, and he made, that's what he campaigned on.
[1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:39.400]  And, and so, uh, but we don't, we don't get that information, but this is an absolutely fact.
[1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:45.000]  Um, well, I was going to say the guy that he's running against is back to the core of the
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:50.120]  founding and even tied into some Iran conference stuff. So he certainly has spooked connections.
[1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:55.240]  Uh, right. And he was the prime minister for eight years, not the prime minister, the foreign
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:59.160]  minister, when it was the most depressive regime, when it was the most oppressive. So,
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:06.920]  uh, so the, the notion that he's a reformer and you see, if he was a roof, if the moolas
[1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:12.360]  were afraid of him, they would have simply thrown him off the ballot because
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:17.720]  they decide who gets to run for the committee of experts. Yeah. The committee of experts,
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:23.800]  whatever they're called. I can't remember the group's name, but so I think that, uh,
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:29.320]  uh, for, for some reason, uh, he is, was disaffected. They didn't know that.
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:40.680]  And, uh, he has, he's either being manipulated by the, by the CIA or he's in with them. I don't,
[1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:46.760]  you know, it's hard to explain why a pillar of the moola establishment would want to discredit
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:51.720]  the Iranian regime, but that's what regardless, CIA fingerprints are all over it. They admit
[1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:55.480]  they're running it. So here's the question. Is this in your opinion, and I think it's an expert
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:14:00.280]  opinion, Dr. Roberts, uh, is this an attempt to discredit them in the American people's eyes and
[1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:06.120]  the world's eyes? So the world will accept a NATO slash US Israeli strike on Iran.
[1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:12.120]  That's it. That, or it's to overthrow them. I mean, so either way they win. And so all these
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:17.560]  dumb kids don't know they're about to bring in shock and all, and all their cities, uh, level.
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:23.560]  They're not going to be idiots. Yeah. Those, those, those, uh, young, secularized, westernized
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:29.800]  protesters are idiots. They're dupes of the CIA and they're either going to end up with an American
[1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:34.920]  puppet government or they're going to have, or they're going to have thousands of people killed
[1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:39.160]  in their beautiful country, destroyed an American military strike. One or the other is going to
[1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:44.680]  happen. And you just said it, very modernized, very beautiful country. The big bankers don't
[1:14:44.680 --> 1:14:52.920]  like that. That's right. And not only that, you see, they've, Iran is getting connected with
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:58.760]  Russia and China in that new organization. Shanghai cooperative. And that then gives them
[1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:06.840]  essentially 60% of the world's oil reserves. And, and of course we don't like that either. We don't
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:11.320]  want that. And, uh, so what do we do about this? Nothing. I guess we just, I guess Obama's going
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:15.960]  to blow Iran to bits and all the liberals will say, oh great, he's giving them freedom. That,
[1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:21.720]  that's, yeah, just like Iraq, a million dead, four million refugees and we've given them freedom.
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:28.360]  The whole country's destroyed, just like we're doing in Afghanistan. And, uh, you know, why the
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:34.040]  world puts up with this, um, I, I don't know, I think it's because we just give the money. So
[1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:40.520]  maybe if we have an economic collapse, uh, the world will have a chance to go its own way and
[1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:46.520]  realize its own aspirations. But for now it looks like American hegemony is prevailing.
[1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:52.840]  But meanwhile, American hegemony is raping us, the American people as well. They're
[1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:57.720]  alluding us. So it's, it's, yeah. Well, as you said earlier, you know, they're getting power over
[1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:04.520]  all the money over everybody's business. It's just, um, it's an amazing thing. You know,
[1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:09.080]  it's actually, as I said the other day, there's really no difference between the American citizens
[1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:15.720]  today and the fictional citizens in George Orwell's book, 1984. Dr. Roberts, we appreciate your
[1:16:15.720 --> 1:16:19.640]  integrity, your research, the incredible amount of data you brought together because I was trying
[1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:24.120]  to figure this out and you really, uh, did a great job. Thank you for spending Father's Day
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:28.680]  with us. Get back to your family. God bless you. God bless you, Alex. There goes Dr. Paul Craig
[1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:32.600]  Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, a real conservative. We'll be right back with more. Stay with us.

[1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:51.640]  Yeah, those Iranian teenagers are going to get what they want. Those cities completely leveled
[1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:58.760]  and they're going to put in hardcore Muslim extremists over them, just like Iraq. 60% of the
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:05.640]  graduates of college were women, the doctors. Rock and roll music was on. Not anymore. They're all
[1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:13.720]  wearing the burkas and CIA's in command. I tell you, the key to the whole new world order is
[1:21:13.720 --> 1:21:18.200]  Muslim extremists. I more and more realize this. They are the magic key, the sword of death.
[1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:24.120]  They are the little secret because you got these mullahs, Shiites, Sunnis, both sides. They got
[1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:28.200]  mind-controlled people that will blow themselves up and think they're doing it for Allah and they
[1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:32.840]  always work for the British government. I mean, when you really get down to it and that's what
[1:21:32.840 --> 1:21:37.720]  the head mullah came out and said, this is the British government because he knows because
[1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:42.280]  they've been fighting those guys and working with them for decades. It goes back and forth.
[1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:50.600]  This is like chess, ladies and gentlemen, but 10 times more complex. And we're here looking
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:54.920]  at this huge chessboard. I can't get the American people to even realize we're playing chess,
[1:21:54.920 --> 1:22:00.440]  that there's a game on, that this is real, that there's powerful elites and sucked refuge. And
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:06.040]  in fact, I want to play this clip, then your calls are coming up and I got Sir Huda Bird coming
[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:11.640]  in here to talk about this bill. She can't make this stuff up anymore. I mean, who could come
[1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:16.760]  up with this? I couldn't imagine things this ridiculous. But, but the reason I thought of this
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:23.480]  guy, months ago, I meant to play this and they didn't do it. But last night, I met the officer
[1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:28.760]  at about 10 o'clock at night. They're re-airing her Aldo Rivera show and there's like these weird
[1:22:28.760 --> 1:22:34.680]  zombie red coats. I say zombie. They looked like they were out of their minds with these vacant
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:41.560]  stairs playing a revolutionary war music, but, but British tunes with our soldiers on the set
[1:22:41.560 --> 1:22:49.960]  with him. And I was like, they're playing revolutionary anti, uh, you know, colonialist
[1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:54.920]  music. And it was some weird message. And I keep seeing red coats with our troops at White House
[1:22:54.920 --> 1:23:01.240]  events and, uh, at events at Arlington Cemetery. It's like a desecrating us. And I'm not,
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:07.800]  I'm not a Anglophile phobe. I mean, I don't dislike the British. I mean, my last name's Jones and
[1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:11.960]  I have two guys that work for me in England, great, smart people. I'm saying the elite of
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:18.280]  England. So I'm sitting there watching this as we sit there in the coffee room watching Fox News.
[1:23:19.480 --> 1:23:25.400]  And then it cuts to Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen. And he's saying, I tell you what,
[1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:30.280]  her Aldo, I just think we ought to be able to help them. It's despicable that Obama's trying to
[1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:34.680]  stop us from freeing these people that we don't, we're not given support to these great Iranians
[1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:38.760]  that he's saying every other day. He wants to turn into a glass parking lot, but suddenly he loves
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:42.520]  them. And suddenly, you know, they're all for police brutality here, but oh my gosh, they're
[1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:48.120]  doing it over there. It's bad. And think of how that scyop works. They're funding the whole thing
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:53.080]  on record. They're staging the whole thing on record. They're lying and twisting everything.
[1:23:53.080 --> 1:23:59.720]  He knows that and there he is lying to the American people with pleasure, knowing it's all a lie,
[1:23:59.720 --> 1:24:04.520]  saying we ought to be supporting him. Obama isn't supporting him, which gives Obama left cover.
[1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:09.320]  See, oh, now the left will be, oh, see, he's an anti-war guy and the right wing will hate
[1:24:09.320 --> 1:24:15.720]  Barack Obama and that reinforces the controlled Republican party and all these CIA operatives.
[1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:19.560]  And that's what Bill Cohen is. He admits he's worked with them in Beirut and other places and
[1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:26.040]  Mossad. That's, it's all about reaffirming that false left, right paradigm and giving Obama left
[1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:32.040]  cover. When was the big New Brzezinski's running this entire operation as his national security
[1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:37.800]  advisor's top advisor? So he's like the supervisor over his national security advisor. He's the real
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:41.880]  power behind the throne. And we predicted all of this in the Obama deception and all the interviews
[1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:45.800]  I have for the second film coming out soon. It's all about this already. We're already predicting
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:53.240]  this film. What's now happening. It's just incredible. So the issue here that I'm trying to get to is
[1:24:53.240 --> 1:25:03.640]  it made me think of Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen because I remember Rumsfeld in 2002 and Bush
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:08.840]  going, we're taking off the gloves and the torture memos, ordering the torture and how they were
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:13.800]  waterboarding them and bragging on Fox news. They were stopping their hearts with medical devices
[1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:17.640]  and torturing them much worse than waterboarding and how they were getting fake confessions and
[1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:23.480]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, supposed number two in Al Qaeda, they got him to confess to bombing buildings
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:29.720]  that weren't built till four years after he was in jail. So six years of being waterboarded,
[1:25:29.720 --> 1:25:36.760]  they admit hundreds of times, two times a day for almost six years. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed confessed
[1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:43.000]  to everything but killing Kennedy, killing, um, you know, sinking the Lusitania, the Titanic,
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:49.160]  crucifying Jesus. I mean, he, and they put out on the news he'd done this. He had bombed buildings
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:53.480]  that didn't exist when he was arrested and they admitted that they threatened his family. That
[1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:58.280]  was in the news that they tortured his kids. The Washington Post bragged and said, yeah,
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:01.640]  when they, you know, they tortured him for years and he wouldn't say he did it. So they got his
[1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:05.400]  kids in there and started doing it and he said, fine, I'll say whatever you want. Totally made
[1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:11.160]  up. He was clearly a CIA operative. They were setting up. So Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen
[1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:15.880]  selling at a conference, a news conference, and they're making the joke about, is this on record?
[1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:20.360]  Oh, I don't care if it is. When he knew it was a press conference. This is Lieutenant Colonel
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:26.440]  Bill Cohen at a press conference in Los Angeles bragging and selling, oh, I'm not for waterboarding.
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:31.240]  I'm from electricity, but only if it saves our troops. When you know it's only good for fake
[1:26:31.240 --> 1:26:36.840]  confessions and only good for tyranny and terror over the people. It's so sick, but it gets worse.
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:41.560]  It gets worse. You can pull this up. This has been in the Associated Press. They have arrested
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:47.400]  dozens and dozens of people. It's got to be over 30 or 40 that I've seen in the news alone
[1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:54.520]  at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, places like that, uh, in Iraq, because it'll come out that
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:59.560]  they tortured somebody or they sodomized them with large, uh, objects dripping with battery
[1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:03.640]  acid. That's in the army's own report. And so Bush and them said, we didn't order that,
[1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:07.880]  arrest them. And then they send these people who followed orders to prison
[1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:11.240]  and guess how they keep them from blowing the whistle. In fact, you can Google this,
[1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:19.560]  Google this guys, um, torture guard, silenced under Patriot Act. They use anti-terror rules
[1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:26.200]  on the torturers that followed orders to shut them up. So Bush and Rumsfeld and Gonzales and all
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:31.000]  these sickos won't go to prison. And so they sent a whole bunch of these people to prison
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:36.040]  that followed orders. The White House orders are now public. And then the White House says
[1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:42.680]  they never ordered torture. And then last year, this is just late last year, 2008,
[1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:48.120]  Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cohen goes on TV and brags that he tortures people. So they're allowed to
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:53.160]  brag they're torturing people and then they send their own patsies to jail. I mean, that's how,
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:58.040]  that's who you work for CIA. I hear the CIA ads recruiting for domestic operations. Listen,
[1:27:58.040 --> 1:28:02.280]  you dumb kids, they're going to set you up. They're all into lying to you. They work for
[1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:07.800]  offshore banks. They want to destroy this country. Go ahead and play the clip. Everything I say here
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:11.400]  or not is on the record. I hope it is. It always is. I'd like to go on the record as saying,
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:16.680]  we've talked about torture here last night and this morning. I do not like waterboarding.
[1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:20.360]  I do not like waterboarding. I prefer electricity.
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:27.960]  Yeah, little kids getting rife, real funny by that statement. And it concerns me quite a bit
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:35.720]  that John McCain has already seated interrogation techniques to certain people. I would never,
[1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:41.240]  for a moment, use harsh technique techniques and I have used them on just anybody. But you know,
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:45.800]  sometimes there are certain people. Yeah, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:51.080]  that's enough from the punk. That's enough. Like his kids got tortured. You mean like him? They take
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:28:56.520]  your soul, folks. He is shelling you. He's all in deception. They all sit around laughing how
[1:28:56.520 --> 1:29:00.840]  they manipulate and deceive people. Like he went on the news last night and said, I wish we were
[1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:04.280]  supporting the overthrow of Iran right now when he knows the whole thing's being run.
[1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:10.840]  They'll take your farm and ranch too, folks. If they'll kill a million 300,000 Iraqis,
[1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:15.320]  they'll kill you better than the hammer. And they're building a giant force of sickos like him
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:19.720]  that are ready to do it. Well, I'm a real red blooded American and I'm not part of torturing
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:24.040]  kids, you son of a... Listen to me. We're going to beat you people and we're not scared of you.

[1:33:50.680 --> 1:33:56.840]  and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us. The toll-free number to join us now is 877-590-5525,
[1:33:56.840 --> 1:34:02.280]  all over the country, 877-590-5525, and we're listening to us out of the flagship station
[1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:08.200]  we transmit and syndicate out of, News Radio 590K, LBJ. It's 836-0590.
[1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:14.280]  In a moment, I'm going to get into one of the biggest federal land grabs, if not the biggest
[1:34:14.280 --> 1:34:20.280]  ever, and I read the bill. I can't believe I'm in America, and I'm Alex Jones. I expect all of this,
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:24.680]  and then the Federal Reserve Offshore Own is announcing it's taking over the entire country,
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:29.400]  all businesses, no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, makes the Patriot Act look like heaven.
[1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:33.640]  I'm going to recap that and then go to your calls, but I wanted to bring up Sarah Hutterberg,
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:38.360]  because I forget the news we cover how bad it is. A week and a half, two weeks ago,
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:43.080]  a caller calls in and goes, have you seen the Clean Water Restoration Act, 787? I go, no.
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:47.480]  I pull it up. It says, a puddle, rainwater, anything. The feds own your property. They can
[1:34:47.480 --> 1:34:51.720]  shut it down. They can take it. Worse than the animal ID. Worse than the premise society for
[1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:56.920]  takeover. I read it and it says, no warrants. Come on your property. They're going to set up new
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:00.200]  divisions. This is the way the Green Corps is going to get on your property. And the New York
[1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:05.720]  Times reported Thursday that they're hiring felons for Obama's Green Corps. Felons. Look,
[1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:11.400]  you can't make this up. Felons are coming to your ranch and farm. I was looking at like five acres
[1:35:11.400 --> 1:35:15.400]  out in the Hill Country on a creek and thinking, oh, can I get that place to run to with my family?
[1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:18.760]  Now it won't matter. Little guys with ponytails and machine guns are going to show up and say,
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:25.560]  lick my boots or you're going to die. And this isn't a joke. Text of S787 Clean Water Restoration
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:29.880]  Act and that some folks in the state are upset. I've read about this. Again, this is Texas Fighting
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:35.880]  and other states, I guess, aren't. I know that Sir Huda Berg, a reporter here at News Radio 590
[1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:43.960]  KLBJ, also has some clips of some of the Cattleman Association groups, but this is a show all over
[1:35:43.960 --> 1:35:50.680]  the nation. Please fight S787 because this sucker has passed out a committee going to the full
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:55.800]  Senate. And they're saying they've got the votes for this. I mean, again, total takeover.
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:59.800]  Sarah Huda Berg, tell us what's going on. Hey, Alex. Yes, the bill, it already made it out of
[1:35:59.800 --> 1:36:04.120]  the Senate committee. And like, as you already said, it gives the federal government authority
[1:36:04.120 --> 1:36:09.560]  over all water in the United States, even on privately owned land. And KLBJ talked to Jason
[1:36:09.560 --> 1:36:13.960]  Skaggs. He's with the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Razors Association. I'm just going to
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:19.320]  go ahead and play a sound clip of him right now. Essentially, this bill would make every
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:25.320]  stock tank, every creek puddle stream, any kind of water body in the state of Texas would be
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:30.680]  under the jurisdiction of the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers. A bill which we feel is one
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:37.400]  of the largest land grabs in recent memory by the U.S. Congress. This bill would remove the term
[1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:42.600]  navigable from the definition of waters of the U.S. If this law were to go into effect,
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:47.640]  the federal government would now have control over numerous bodies of water that they currently
[1:36:47.640 --> 1:36:52.920]  do not. And that's a burden on Texas property owners and landowners that is just completely
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:58.600]  unnecessary and just a big grab on the federal government's part. Sarah, thanks for that report.
[1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:03.640]  You say you've got family that are in ranching. So do I. They've all been harassed, building a new
[1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:09.400]  barn, anything under the wetlands act. And so people litigated and defeated that because there
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:14.200]  was no federal jurisdiction. If you had a puddle, they would try to force you off your land or
[1:37:14.200 --> 1:37:19.560]  force you to sell. Austin has land grabbed over 20,000 acres under the guise of that. And later,
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:24.440]  they build hotels on it with their buddies. But give us your quick take on that. Well,
[1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:28.600]  I actually, I do have an uncle who's a cattle rancher near Victoria, Texas. And I know that he
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:33.080]  would not be happy to hear about this bill at all. And the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Razors
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:38.600]  Association, they're urging the US senators from Texas to vote no on this Clean Water Restoration
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:42.920]  Act. And hopefully that will happen because this is just the government continuing to find
[1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:47.640]  ways to regulate the lives and freedoms of Americans. Absolutely. Plus we have a 10 to
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:51.640]  ninth amendment. I mean, the feds have never been able to do this before. Why are they?
[1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:57.640]  Why are they doing it now? I don't know. They're just trying to find more ways. I mean,
[1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:02.280]  more ways to take away our rights and get into the privately owned things in our lives.
[1:38:02.280 --> 1:38:07.240]  Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, I know you're going to continue to cover this here at News Radio 590
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:11.400]  KLBJ. Sarah Hudaberg, thanks for coming on. Sure. Thanks, Alex. You bet. Thanks for that report.
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:15.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, I'm like somebody in a batting cage and they got
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:21.560]  five machines turned up on high speed shooting balls at me and I can't hit half of them. I mean,
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:27.880]  and I'm getting hit in the head with them. And then I have all this mainstream news where world
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:32.760]  leaders are meeting calling for one child policies and forced population reductions.
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:37.240]  And I read it from mainstream news on air and I come in and I hear Dr. Dina Dell on the air
[1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:46.600]  before I go on saying none of it exists. No, S787 does exist. And yeah, I mean, it's insane. That's
[1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:51.160]  why I played in a Poletano earlier for a week. I've been ranting and Raven saying this new bill
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:56.200]  allows the Federal Reserve to run everything and take everything over. In fact, they don't even need
[1:38:56.200 --> 1:39:02.440]  this S787. They can control all the waterways. Anything connected to commerce or the economy,
[1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:07.480]  they run it. And that's what all the martial law executive orders state. It's just now
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:13.240]  they're taking that away from the president into an offshore banking system that engineered the
[1:39:13.240 --> 1:39:21.240]  crisis we're now under. So ladies and gentlemen, I'm just begging everybody out there listening to me
[1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:28.360]  to get angry, to get focused, to get upset and to begin to discover the things I've discovered.
[1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:32.760]  I mean, it's not hard. You listen to local talk radio station. You're going to hear on the news
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:38.840]  about this. I mean, this stuff isn't hidden. This stuff is real. And it's true. The CIA is trying
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:42.920]  to overthrow Iran right now. And they're going to go in there and blow that place to daylights
[1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:48.600]  if the public buys it. This is all a big show for you. And I don't like the moolas. The point is
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:52.920]  we are the most hated country on earth because criminals run this nation, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:59.480]  And the good news is Obama's approval rating has dropped from over 80%
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:04.120]  in the last four months to 58% and dropping. So people are getting wise to him. But by the time
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:08.200]  they get wise to him, they'll put some fake Republican in and then I'll go from being called
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:11.960]  a right winger to being called a liberal. You know, when I'm bashing Bush, I'm a communist.
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:16.680]  And then when I'm bashing Obama, I'm a right winger. No, I'm a constitutionalist. I'm a rule
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:22.760]  of law. I want liberty. I don't want to be overrun with bureaucratic thugs. I know the CPS is run
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:27.240]  by a bunch of pedophiles on average stealing kids. I know they're doing it without due process.
[1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:32.280]  Folks, the crimes of this government, it isn't a government. It is a clearinghouse for criminals
[1:40:32.280 --> 1:40:37.800]  to rape us financially, physically, spiritually, psychologically. I got articles here where in
[1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:43.400]  one year, 26% increase in prozac use by the public. I mean, the public's all a bunch of drugged out
[1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:49.560]  drooling zombies. The criminals are running wild. And anybody with half a brain just trying to keep
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:53.560]  their head down. I mean, you know what? This is a recipe for disaster, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:58.440]  And I told my wife today, I was sitting in the backyard of my children and I said, I, and I'm
[1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:03.160]  not just saying this. I said, I've sworn to stay here and fight for this country, but I may get
[1:41:03.160 --> 1:41:08.520]  my family out of the country. I am two inches away. I'm two inches away and I may just, just,
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:14.360]  and I'm sick of dealing with it and then trying to hustle and get sponsors and fund the operation
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:18.920]  and get the word out just to have people say, oh, you just want to be a big shot. No, I want out
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:25.560]  of this, man. I wish this wasn't true. I have to go against my instincts and go against my own
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:31.960]  fleshly desires to just go live in a little house somewhere. That's what I like and have lots of
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:40.040]  time off of my family. I have to, I am a regular guy. I'm just some aggressive redneck stock Texan
[1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:44.600]  who loves freedom and liberty and I'm not a slave and I know when a tyranny is coming down on me
[1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:48.360]  and I'm not going along with it. And I don't know what's wrong with you people out there.
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:53.160]  You understand hardcore tyrannies taken over the country. I mean, it's so bad. I can't even tell
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:42:00.600]  you how bad it is. It's so evil. I can't even express how bad it is. Let's take a quick call
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:06.440]  here. Let's talk to Ruth and Florida. Ruth are on the air. Hey, I totally see. I don't know what's
[1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:12.280]  wrong with everybody. Well, they're drinking sodium fluoride. Yeah, probably. I did have a good little
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:18.280]  incident the other day. I love to have good signs. I work in a little donut shop and in the morning
[1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:22.920]  there's this little old lady. She's got 70 years old, comes in and gets donuts for her little push
[1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:27.720]  cart in the college over here. And as of next week, she's out of a job because they've decided
[1:42:27.720 --> 1:42:31.800]  they're going to bring a corporation in there and let them sell food. Oh, yeah. Why let a slave sell
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:36.120]  something on the street corner? Look, they're arresting Amish for selling eggs. I know.
[1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:40.840]  SWAT teams are going to hit you and hit you hard. It's over. And the little strip that I work in,
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:45.880]  there's a little job corps office place, so a lot of people show up there. Some of them a little bit
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:51.000]  scary, but people looking for work, desperate for work. Well, you're not allowed to sell hot dogs
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:54.120]  or donuts anymore. If you don't like it, SWAT teams are going to kill you better than a hammer.
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:59.480]  I know. Well, it turned out between myself and this nice little old lady and this young black
[1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:05.480]  man about 20, 30 something, you know, they started talking about the corporations and coming in.
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:09.800]  And I was almost, I was just getting tingly because it's so hard to find people that are
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:15.000]  willing to discuss this stuff. And here we were, you know, me at 52, and then this nice little
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.560]  lady and this, and I tell you what, tell me what they said when we get back. Hey, Ruth, Ruth,
[1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:22.760]  stay there. I want to hear what they say when we get back. Don't hang up. I got a break. We're
[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:26.440]  going to go back to Ruth. We're going to go to John and a few others on the other side, ladies and
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:37.640]  gentlemen. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[1:43:37.640 --> 1:43:42.120]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:46.680]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds have outperformed
[1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:50.840]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:56.040]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[1:43:56.040 --> 1:44:02.040]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:06.520]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:11.720]  any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:21.000]  today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:30.040]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:37.640]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. If you owe the IRS, you can't make the problem

[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:53.960]  Okay, sorry, Ruth. So you're in the donut shop. It's an old lady,
[1:47:53.960 --> 1:47:58.600]  isn't allowed to sell donuts on the street anymore, and a young black guy running your
[1:47:58.600 --> 1:48:04.040]  donut shop. Okay, go ahead and finish your story. Nothing, it was just really thrilling that I could
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:08.600]  actually see that, you know, there was somebody out there. I'm not walking around alone trying to,
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:12.040]  you know, talk about this stuff. It was good to finally see somebody that
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:16.520]  knew what was going on. Well, you notice they were being hurt by it, though. That's why they knew about it. Exactly.
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:22.760]  Exactly. Also, too, two more things. Saw a really good film last night. People want to see the CIA in
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:28.680]  action. Watch that one. The revolution will not be televised. That was really cool. You can see
[1:48:28.680 --> 1:48:35.560]  them putting it down. And another thing is people shouldn't be saying they can't do nothing. I can't do a lot either, but
[1:48:35.560 --> 1:48:42.120]  I found this package of business cards I had bought one time, and I took them, and I took the Obama deception, and
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:47.320]  took the picture and shrunk it down real little, and I had it typed in there. Same bosses, or let's see,
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:53.080]  new boss, same as the old boss, infowars.com, and I throw those things everywhere I go.
[1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:58.280]  Absolutely. God bless you, Ruth. Listen, folks, we have this Arnold Schwarzenegger,
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:05.080]  archetypal Hercules image that this big hero has to do it all for you, and that it is an
[1:49:05.080 --> 1:49:10.600]  instant gratification against corruption that we can't beat it. The corruption seeks in. We have to
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:16.360]  seep in against it. And, you know, spread the word about this radio show, getting documentary
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:20.520]  films that are powerful, making copies of Obama deception, in game, terror storm, my films are the
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:26.120]  most effective, giving them out, spreading free links to my films online to people. Starting a
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:31.160]  local access TV show, starting a local radio show, a lot of towns you can get on Saturday or Sunday
[1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:35.640]  with a show, and if it will become successful, you can maybe get a weekday show, or volunteer to
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:40.440]  do local news for a local station. If you've had a history of that, and, you know, come in, now a
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:44.040]  lot of these stations will listen to you and let you do reports about the New World Order, because
[1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:49.640]  it's out in the open now. You know, we've got to come together and decide this is mainstream, and that
[1:49:50.680 --> 1:49:54.680]  foreign corporations are raping us and looting the nation, and that we're not going to let this
[1:49:54.680 --> 1:50:00.200]  happen. I mean, I just read to you, mainstream news where the Federal Reserve, no Bill of Rights,
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:05.720]  no Constitution, sees any business they want, any company, run everything. That is dictatorship
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:10.920]  of foreign banks. This is a new form of government where an offshore corporate bank controls the
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:16.440]  nation. That's worse than the classical colonialism where it was some empire, because then these
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:24.280]  bankers claim there's no welfare. They claim that the state has, you know, no job to take care of
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:29.960]  people. They have no responsibility. They have no liability. It's all fraud. They rule us. They
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:35.240]  tax us at the point of a gun through the government. Offshore corporations coupling with government
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:41.720]  to control us. I mean, this is insane. And then the text of S787 Clean Water Restoration Act,
[1:50:41.720 --> 1:50:49.560]  just Google text of Senate Bill or just S787 Clean Water Act. And you can go read this for
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:55.400]  yourself. I mean, read it. Read it. Virginia State Police say anti-New World Order and gun rights
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:51:01.240]  activists are terrorists, Kurt Nemo, infowars.com. This story needs to go to completely viral,
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:06.520]  just like we forced this, you know, I went and read the bill Monday. They finally made public
[1:51:06.520 --> 1:51:10.760]  of the Federal Reserve takeover. I knew it was going to be a takeover, but not a complete total.
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:14.680]  No bill of rights, no constitution, no nothing. Everything's ruled by these bankers,
[1:51:14.680 --> 1:51:20.520]  but they can already steal $14.8 trillion in eight months since the bailout. And no one
[1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:24.280]  can investigate them. So why not just have total power? Hell, if they're getting away with that,
[1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:31.480]  why not? And then presidents will come and go, but they'll stay in power. But this story,
[1:51:31.480 --> 1:51:35.000]  Virginia State Police say anti-New World Order and gun rights activists are terrorists,
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:39.960]  this was posted on their website. One of our listeners said, look at the Virginia State Police
[1:51:39.960 --> 1:51:45.720]  website. You can go to their website and read this. They've gone from six months ago, this stuff
[1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:50.120]  being secret and we'd break it and people wouldn't believe us to just, yeah, all protesting as
[1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:55.080]  terrorism. All gun rights groups are evil. The second amendment's terrorism. I mean, it actually
[1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:59.800]  says it. And then this one, proposed law allows Attorney General Holder to block gun sales to
[1:51:59.800 --> 1:52:03.560]  over a million Americans, including veterans. They're just, if we, if they feel like it,
[1:52:03.560 --> 1:52:09.000]  no judge, no jury, no facing your accuser, you just can't own guns anymore. And they're saying
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:18.440]  that they're not only going to come in and not let you buy guns, they're going to come and take
[1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:23.560]  them. Forget the 68 gun control act where felons can't own guns. They just show up and take your
[1:52:23.560 --> 1:52:30.040]  guns and they won't tell you why. I mean, this is total tyranny. And DOD training manual describes
[1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:35.880]  protests as low level terrorism. This is a public DOD training manual that they teach all the new
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:42.600]  people in army security forces and MPs that all protest is illegal. All, I mean, it's, this is
[1:52:42.600 --> 1:52:50.760]  mainstream. I just, I can't handle it. I mean, it's just, let's go back to your calls. John
[1:52:50.760 --> 1:52:55.640]  and Florida, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Yes, sir. You know, the victories will start
[1:52:55.640 --> 1:53:01.080]  becoming in. And thanks to, thanks to you, you'll be riding away when these victories start coming
[1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:07.400]  in. I'll probably get a bullet in my head. This is not fun. This is the most unbelievable thing
[1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:14.040]  in the St. Petersburg Times, Florida St. Petersburg Times today, headline news. They brought down a
[1:53:14.040 --> 1:53:18.760]  CIA colony. They've been trying to bring them down. The Scientologists or headquarters are here.
[1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:25.320]  They've infiltrated the Clearwater Police. They've shut down newspapers. As you know, their history
[1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:33.560]  is phenomenal. Absolutely. So what is it saying? Well, it's unbelievable. The guy that's ahead of
[1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:37.400]  the, they're bringing down the whole head. He's on the front page of the paper. They've never done
[1:53:37.400 --> 1:53:44.360]  this before. They, so what happened? Okay. The head of the Scientologists locked 12 board members
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:49.880]  in his room. They're exposing, there's like four bed board members came out. So they were locked
[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:54.760]  in there for two weeks with 10 other members. Not, they couldn't even leave on their own accord.
[1:53:54.760 --> 1:54:00.840]  This guy has been slapping people, punching them. The guy is called, I mean, is that Mark
[1:54:00.840 --> 1:54:06.520]  Kavage or is that one of the lawyers that runs it? No, it's Miss Cave. He was like, he started
[1:54:06.520 --> 1:54:11.320]  when he was like in the 10th grade. He dropped out of school. He was Ron Hubbard's cabin boy on
[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:16.360]  a yacht and then he came and he's taken over the complete thing over and he's been running it now
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:21.080]  ever since Hubbard died. Well, I know Hubbard was tied in to Alistair Crowley and all that,
[1:54:21.800 --> 1:54:26.840]  like, like the jet propulsion laboratory in NASA. NASA was basically founded by Alistair
[1:54:26.840 --> 1:54:31.960]  Crowley and Nazis. That's mainstream. That's what I mean. Who can make this stuff up? What type of
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:40.040]  fruitcake country has Alistair Crowley and, and, and Nazis? I mean, and, and I was on the set of
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:45.160]  Ultimate Fighting Championship with ESPN talking to Joe Rogan and there's the head
[1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:49.560]  announcer and I'm going, yeah, you know, Goddard Space Center, top Nazis. And the guy walked over
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:55.000]  and thought I was a liar saying Nazis were at NASA. I mean, they just, the public doesn't know
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.960]  anything. And I'm not bashing that guy. It's just that they, they don't know. But anyways,
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:01.960]  what's the headline and I'll try to cover it this week.
[1:55:03.480 --> 1:55:06.920]  Well, it's just bringing down the Scientologists. I mean, they've got a three,
[1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:11.880]  but I mean, what's the headline so I can read the article in the St. Petersburg newspaper?
[1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:15.720]  I think it's on the front times. I just read it on the computer, but it's on the front page
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:20.520]  and they're having like a whole story. I mean, it's just, they're breaking this thing up. The,
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:24.680]  the guy is, they're going to sue them. They've never been bought this out before. They've taken over
[1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:28.360]  papers down here. They've tried to take them down. No, I know they've been convicted for
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:33.720]  infiltrating the FBI and CIA. Thank you. Very interesting information. Just what I need. I'm
[1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:39.320]  taking on the whole new world order CIA and I'm the Scientologist. I'm just getting crazy here.
[1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:44.440]  Let's talk to Arthur and Mass. You know what, might as well just go all the way. You know what
[1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:49.480]  they say? I might as well just write my own obituary and then just get it over with and decide
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:53.240]  it's all in God's hands. I've already done that a long time ago, but I mean almost publicly
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:57.240]  and just decide I'm already dead. Put it all in God's hands and that's just the way it is.
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:56:01.320]  I'm going all the way to the end. I'm doing my job. I'm standing up for what's right
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:05.240]  and I'm not going to pull any punches. We're just going to tell it like it is. I'm going to live on
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:10.360]  my feet and not on my knees. And if more of you would have that attitude, this evil would disappear
[1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:16.680]  like dreams at dawn, like phantoms at dawn. Let's talk to Arthur. All we have time for calls.
[1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:20.680]  Arthur and Mass, go ahead. Hello, Alex. Yes, sir. Got two minutes. Go for it.
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:25.960]  Hey, good to speak with you. I've been trying to contact you about two and a half, three years.
[1:56:25.960 --> 1:56:33.880]  I did an original research proposal on fluoride implication on osteoporosis.
[1:56:33.880 --> 1:56:37.080]  Oh, that's an admitted fact. I have all the big government reports. That's why they put it in the
[1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:42.760]  water. And you know, I listened to the talk probably three or four times. By the way, folks,
[1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:45.720]  just don't believe these phony doctors on the radio that say there's no evidence
[1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:51.560]  sodium fluoride is bad. Just Google fluoridation of water bone cancer. You will see thousands
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:58.360]  of government reports. It is an admitted fact. It gives you bone cancer. Go ahead. One of the biggest
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:05.240]  points you probably missed because it's so corrupt and this has been going on since the early 1900s
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:12.040]  and it's always been covered up. Hundreds of degenerative bone and skeletal problems.
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:16.840]  It's really obvious. And it's like it's still Paul Cutter has been doing a battle
[1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:22.840]  day to day, week to week to get fluoridation out of our get the fluoride out of our water.
[1:57:22.840 --> 1:57:26.200]  Well, we got a tour of the Austin water this week and the people there didn't like it.
[1:57:26.200 --> 1:57:29.640]  And they said, we know we know it's bad. We don't like it, but don't don't quote us.
[1:57:29.640 --> 1:57:31.880]  Yeah, we know this is bad. They're not stupid. They got to wear
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:34.760]  chemical weapons suits when they put it in the water.
[1:57:34.760 --> 1:57:42.600]  Yeah, even in at all mass, they had a, they came up and they shot it down to keep the
[1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:45.080]  fluoridation going. At all mass, one of the highest.
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:52.440]  And you know what's sick? This is the byproduct of aluminum manufacturing, mainly. It's also
[1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:57.160]  radioactive because that's it. It's those type of rocks that they get the chemicals for fertilizer
[1:57:57.160 --> 1:58:01.560]  out of that also where they mine uranium in the water. It's got waste. It's got lead. It's got
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:06.280]  cad. Oh, I know exactly. When you hear fluoride, it's a cover for arsenic, everything. You don't
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:09.320]  believe me? Go call Austin. If you live in Austin or other cities, they'll go, yeah,
[1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:13.000]  we're hitting you hard with chemical weapons. Hope you like it. Hope you enjoy getting brain
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:18.760]  cancer out of time. Back live this week, 11 to three there in the week at info wars.com
