[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrats and the mainstream American media have fully exposed
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.080]  themselves as the fascist authoritarians they are.
[00:16.080 --> 00:22.720]  Thank God, there is one man standing in the way of this fascist circus, the Michael Cohen
[00:22.720 --> 00:26.400]  testimony, and that man is Jim Jordan.
[00:26.400 --> 00:30.080]  There was his opening statement.
[00:30.080 --> 00:32.000]  Mr. Chairman, here we go.
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  Here we go.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.320]  Your first big hearing, your first announced witness, Michael Cohen.
[00:36.320 --> 00:38.560]  I want everyone in this room to think about this.
[00:38.560 --> 00:43.480]  The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in
[00:43.480 --> 00:47.520]  two months for lying to Congress.
[00:47.520 --> 00:52.600]  Mr. Chairman, your chairmanship will always be identified with this hearing, and we all
[00:52.600 --> 00:55.000]  need to understand what this is.
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.200]  This is the Michael Cohen hearing presented by Lanny Davis.
[00:59.200 --> 01:04.480]  That's right, Lanny Davis choreographed the whole darn thing.
[01:04.480 --> 01:10.640]  The Clinton's best friend, loyalist, operative, Lanny Davis put this all together.
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.640]  You know how we know?
[01:11.640 --> 01:12.640]  He told our staff.
[01:12.640 --> 01:13.640]  He told the committee staff.
[01:13.640 --> 01:15.440]  He said the hearing was his idea.
[01:15.440 --> 01:16.440]  He selected this committee.
[01:16.440 --> 01:21.240]  He had to talk Michael Cohen into coming, and most importantly, he had to persuade the
[01:21.240 --> 01:23.880]  chairman to actually have it.
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.160]  He told us, took two months to get that job done, but here we are.
[01:28.160 --> 01:29.840]  He talked him into it.
[01:29.840 --> 01:35.520]  This might be the first time someone convicted of lying to Congress has appeared again so
[01:35.520 --> 01:37.520]  quickly in front of Congress.
[01:37.520 --> 01:42.440]  Certainly, it's the first time a convicted perjurer has been brought back to be a star
[01:42.440 --> 01:45.160]  witness in a hearing.
[01:45.160 --> 01:50.360]  And there's a reason this is the first, because no other committee would do it.
[01:50.360 --> 01:54.120]  Think about this, with Mr. Cohen here, this committee.
[01:54.120 --> 01:55.720]  We got lots of lawyers on this committee.
[01:55.720 --> 02:00.880]  This committee is actually encouraging a witness to violate attorney-client privilege.
[02:00.880 --> 02:07.600]  Mr. Chairman, when we legitimize dishonesty, we delegitimize this institution.
[02:07.600 --> 02:12.600]  We're supposed to pursue the truth, but you have stacked the deck against the truth.
[02:12.600 --> 02:14.440]  We're only allowed to ask certain questions.
[02:14.440 --> 02:17.840]  Even with that amendment, you just told us about, well, Russ is now on the table.
[02:17.840 --> 02:21.200]  You had instantly told us we can't ask questions about the special counsel, can't ask questions
[02:21.200 --> 02:25.560]  about the Southern District of New York, can't ask questions about Russia.
[02:25.560 --> 02:26.560]  Nope.
[02:26.560 --> 02:27.560]  Nope.
[02:27.560 --> 02:32.640]  Only subjects we can talk about are ones you think are going to be harmful to the President
[02:32.640 --> 02:34.560]  of the United States.
[02:34.560 --> 02:39.480]  And the answers to those questions are going to come from a guy who can't be trusted.
[02:39.480 --> 02:42.560]  Here's what the U.S. Attorney said about Mr. Cohen.
[02:42.560 --> 02:48.320]  Well, Mr. Cohen enjoyed a privileged life, his desire for ever greater wealth and influence
[02:48.320 --> 02:52.960]  precipitated an extensive course of criminal conduct.
[02:52.960 --> 02:59.320]  Mr. Cohen committed four distinct federal crimes over a period of several years.
[02:59.320 --> 03:06.360]  He was motivated to do so by personal greed and repeatedly used his power and influence
[03:06.360 --> 03:10.960]  for deceptive ends, but the Democrats don't care.
[03:10.960 --> 03:11.960]  They don't care.
[03:11.960 --> 03:13.520]  They don't want to use you, Mr. Cohen.
[03:13.520 --> 03:15.440]  You're their patsy today.
[03:15.440 --> 03:21.720]  They got to find somebody somewhere to say something so they can try to remove the President
[03:21.720 --> 03:26.080]  from office, because Tom Steyer told him to.
[03:26.080 --> 03:29.800]  Tom Steyer, last week, organized the town hall.
[03:29.800 --> 03:31.440]  Guess where?
[03:31.440 --> 03:33.800]  Chairman Nadler's district in Manhattan.
[03:33.800 --> 03:37.240]  Two nights ago, Tom Steyer organized the town hall.
[03:37.240 --> 03:38.960]  Guess where?
[03:38.960 --> 03:45.640]  In Cummings district in Baltimore, the best they can find, the best they can find to start
[03:45.640 --> 03:52.520]  this process, Michael Cohen, fraudster, a cheat, convicted felon, and in two months
[03:52.520 --> 03:53.520]  a federal inmate.
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.440]  Oh, actually, they didn't find him.
[03:55.440 --> 03:56.800]  Lady Davis found him.
[03:56.800 --> 03:59.600]  I'll say one thing about the Democrats.
[03:59.600 --> 04:01.880]  They stick to the playbook.
[04:01.880 --> 04:05.080]  Remember, remember how all this started.
[04:05.080 --> 04:11.400]  The Clinton campaign hired Perkins Cooley Law Firm, who hired Glenn Simpson, who hired
[04:11.400 --> 04:17.360]  a foreigner, Christopher Steele, who put together the fake dossier that the FBI used to go get
[04:17.360 --> 04:21.240]  a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.
[04:21.240 --> 04:24.760]  But when that whole scheme failed, and the American people said, we're going to make
[04:24.760 --> 04:29.360]  Donald Trump president, they said, we got to do something else.
[04:29.360 --> 04:36.440]  So now Clinton loyalist, Clinton operative, Lanny Davis, has persuaded the chairman of
[04:36.440 --> 04:43.720]  the oversight committee to give a convicted felon a forum to tell stories and lie about
[04:43.720 --> 04:48.240]  the president of the United States so they can all start their impeachment process.
[04:48.240 --> 04:52.040]  Mr. Chairman, we are better than this.
[04:52.040 --> 04:55.040]  We are better than this.
[04:55.040 --> 04:56.040]  Total savage.
[04:56.040 --> 05:09.720]  We'll be right back with the Alex Jones Show.
[05:09.720 --> 05:16.160]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[05:16.160 --> 05:22.440]  energy drinks and energy supplements, but they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[05:22.440 --> 05:26.720]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[05:26.720 --> 05:28.800]  hours and have terrible side effects.
[05:28.800 --> 05:35.360]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[05:35.360 --> 05:38.240]  and beyond system in the world.
[05:38.240 --> 05:40.640]  There's nothing else like it, you must experience it.
[05:40.640 --> 05:45.200]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit
[05:45.200 --> 05:47.880]  juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[05:47.880 --> 05:51.520]  Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours, so take a half packet the
[05:51.520 --> 05:55.560]  first time you take it because Turboforce is named Turboforce because it will take you
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.560]  into overdrive.
[05:56.560 --> 06:01.560]  Turboforce and enforcelive.com.
[06:01.560 --> 06:15.240]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[06:15.240 --> 06:20.280]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is going to be a stacked Alex Jones Show here on this
[06:20.280 --> 06:25.040]  Wednesday, February 27, 2019, Owen Troyer filling in for Alex but we will be hearing
[06:25.040 --> 06:33.560]  from Alex from a surprise, a surprise special undisclosed location and we'll just leave
[06:33.560 --> 06:38.560]  it at that for now and we also have a ton of news and clips to get to but what everybody's
[06:38.560 --> 06:45.600]  focused on right now, probably unnecessarily but there will be, let's just say a boomerang
[06:45.600 --> 06:50.560]  effect of this Cohen testimony today but we'll get to all that.
[06:50.560 --> 06:56.800]  In the meantime, let's go live to Cohen the Rat testifying right now before Congress.
[06:56.800 --> 07:01.760]  It would make you inaccurate, in actuality, it would make you a liar which puts you into
[07:01.760 --> 07:07.200]  the same position that I am in and I can only warn people, the more people that follow Mr.
[07:07.200 --> 07:12.480]  Trump, the higher people that I am in are going to suffer the same consequences that
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.320]  I am suffering.
[07:16.320 --> 07:23.360]  What warning would you give young people who are tempted, as you were, would you encourage
[07:23.360 --> 07:26.840]  them not to wait ten years to see the light?
[07:26.840 --> 07:32.240]  What advice would you give young people in particular young lawyers so they do not abuse
[07:32.240 --> 07:34.360]  their bar license as you did?
[07:34.360 --> 07:36.600]  He lost, he got his bar yesterday.
[07:36.600 --> 07:42.200]  I had a wonderful life, I have a beautiful wife, I have two amazing children and I achieved
[07:42.200 --> 07:45.120]  financial success by the age of 39.
[07:45.120 --> 07:50.360]  I didn't go to work for Mr. Trump because I had to, I went to work for him because I
[07:50.360 --> 07:53.760]  wanted to and I've lost it all.
[07:53.760 --> 07:58.840]  So if I'm not a picture perfect, that's the picture that should be up there, if I'm not
[07:58.840 --> 08:04.440]  a picture perfect example of what not to do, that's the example that I'm trying to set
[08:04.440 --> 08:06.240]  for my children.
[08:06.240 --> 08:11.320]  You make mistakes in life and I've owned them and I've taken responsibility for them and
[08:11.320 --> 08:14.360]  I'm paying a huge price as is my family.
[08:14.360 --> 08:19.880]  So if that in and of itself isn't enough to dissuade somebody from acting in the callous
[08:19.880 --> 08:26.960]  manner that I did, I'm not sure that that person has any chance very much like I'm in
[08:26.960 --> 08:29.160]  right now.
[08:29.160 --> 08:33.760]  A recurring theme in your testimony is concern for your family's safety.
[08:33.760 --> 08:37.320]  What specifically are you most concerned about?
[08:37.320 --> 08:42.960]  The president, unlike my Cohen for Trump that has a thousand followers, he's got over 60
[08:42.960 --> 08:49.160]  million people and when Mr. Trump turned around early in the campaign and said, I can shoot
[08:49.160 --> 08:54.760]  somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it, I want to be very clear.
[08:54.760 --> 08:56.080]  He's not joking.
[08:56.080 --> 08:57.320]  He's telling you the truth.
[08:57.320 --> 08:59.120]  He said, you don't know him.
[08:59.120 --> 09:00.280]  I do.
[09:00.280 --> 09:04.160]  I sat next to this man for 10 years and I watched him.
[09:04.160 --> 09:05.160]  Who shot Seth Rich?
[09:05.160 --> 09:07.000]  I'm the one who shot him.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.000]  What happened to Seth Rich?
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.440]  I'm the one who continued in 2015 to promote him.
[09:12.440 --> 09:17.240]  So many things I thought that he can do that are just great and he can and he is doing
[09:17.240 --> 09:22.520]  things that are great, but this destruction of our civility to one another is just, it's
[09:22.520 --> 09:23.520]  out of control.
[09:23.520 --> 09:24.520]  Oh, yeah.
[09:24.520 --> 09:25.520]  It's Trump's fault.
[09:25.520 --> 09:26.520]  Didn't you hear?
[09:26.520 --> 09:30.720]  Jussie Smollett was attacked by a Trump supporter in a MAGA hat.
[09:30.720 --> 09:35.560]  A man's house was burned down because he was a gay activist.
[09:35.560 --> 09:37.600]  Oh, those were hoaxes.
[09:37.600 --> 09:38.600]  This is his country.
[09:38.600 --> 09:43.920]  He's becoming an autocrat and hopefully something bad will happen to me on my children, on
[09:43.920 --> 09:48.400]  my wife, so that I will not be here and testify.
[09:48.400 --> 09:49.400]  That's what his hope was.
[09:49.400 --> 09:51.440]  You know, there's a deep irony to this.
[09:51.440 --> 09:55.760]  Again, I thank everybody who joined and said that it's not, it's like everything else.
[09:55.760 --> 09:59.480]  It's not President Trump's fault that your family would be in any danger, which we hope
[09:59.480 --> 10:01.000]  it's not.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.240]  It's your fault.
[10:03.240 --> 10:08.400]  What is it with people in this country that don't want to take the consequences for their
[10:08.400 --> 10:09.400]  actions?
[10:09.400 --> 10:12.400]  You're the trader, dude.
[10:12.400 --> 10:18.640]  Everybody's job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump.
[10:18.640 --> 10:24.960]  Every day, most of us knew we were coming in and we were going to lie for him on something.
[10:24.960 --> 10:26.880]  And that became the norm.
[10:26.880 --> 10:30.440]  And that's exactly what's happening right now in this country.
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.280]  And it's exactly what's happening here in government, sir.
[10:34.280 --> 10:35.280]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[10:35.280 --> 10:36.280]  My time has expired.
[10:36.280 --> 10:37.280]  I'm strong.
[10:37.280 --> 10:44.840]  Now, folks, this has been going for over an hour now.
[10:44.840 --> 10:46.960]  They're due for a recess.
[10:46.960 --> 10:49.800]  Cohen just requested a recess.
[10:49.800 --> 10:51.440]  I've never seen that before.
[10:51.440 --> 10:53.440]  I did, sir.
[10:53.440 --> 10:58.680]  Yeah, they're like, did you just ask for a break?
[10:58.680 --> 11:02.480]  That's okay.
[11:02.480 --> 11:03.480]  Thank you, sir.
[11:03.480 --> 11:10.000]  I can't even figure out to get Cummings Mike back on, so they will honor Cohen's run in
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  the show.
[11:11.000 --> 11:12.000]  Oh, my gosh.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.840]  Oh, so Elijah Cummings, he just had his gavel taken from him by Cohen.
[11:17.840 --> 11:18.840]  Oh, my gosh.
[11:18.840 --> 11:20.840]  That was beautiful.
[11:20.840 --> 11:21.840]  Wow.
[11:21.840 --> 11:25.320]  Look, here's the deal, folks.
[11:25.320 --> 11:30.800]  If you've been paying attention, I've been watching this whole thing.
[11:30.800 --> 11:37.760]  The optics of this and on a surface level, this looks really bad.
[11:37.760 --> 11:45.960]  But I'm watching an epic car crash happening right now in slow motion.
[11:45.960 --> 11:48.120]  That's what this is.
[11:48.120 --> 11:52.880]  And we're going to get more into this throughout the broadcast day, and we'll continue to
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.000]  cover this live and do a little commentary over it.
[11:58.000 --> 12:06.520]  But this whole thing with Cummings bringing up Michael Cohen as a star witness, his first
[12:06.520 --> 12:11.840]  ever as the head of this committee, who's about to go to jail for a long time for lying
[12:11.840 --> 12:14.080]  to Congress, a known liar.
[12:14.080 --> 12:21.280]  Any lawyer who's not just a total liar will tell you, folks, this is the whole reason
[12:21.280 --> 12:23.760]  why O.J. Simpson was deemed innocent.
[12:23.760 --> 12:27.240]  You have to understand how the legal process works.
[12:27.240 --> 12:33.640]  As soon as you're deemed a liar, as soon as that's established by the court in the case,
[12:33.640 --> 12:39.160]  as soon as that's established, okay, you lied, you're no longer a witness for anything.
[12:39.160 --> 12:43.880]  Anything you said or anything you say is discounted, you're out.
[12:43.880 --> 12:54.200]  That is like just precedent in law, but somehow Cohen comes back up here because the whole
[12:54.200 --> 12:55.200]  thing is a sham.
[12:55.200 --> 13:00.280]  Cohen even admitted he's been meeting with the Democrats before all of this.
[13:00.280 --> 13:05.120]  Elijah Cummings broke the rules of this committee.
[13:05.120 --> 13:13.720]  He broke the rules of the committee, and he did not give 24 hours of the witness testimony
[13:13.720 --> 13:14.720]  to the committee.
[13:14.720 --> 13:21.360]  They gave him the witness testimony, the documents, just hours before the testimony.
[13:21.360 --> 13:22.360]  That's against the rules.
[13:22.360 --> 13:25.200]  You're supposed to get 24 hours.
[13:25.200 --> 13:30.760]  Then Elijah Cummings has the nerve to sit there and lie about it.
[13:30.760 --> 13:32.000]  The whole thing is unbelievable.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.520]  We got all the clips.
[13:34.520 --> 13:42.480]  And so Jim Jordan just says, oh, well, do you think we could maybe postpone this so that
[13:42.480 --> 13:46.960]  we can follow the rules and have 24 hours to go over the witness testimony that you
[13:46.960 --> 13:49.080]  just handed us before he sat down?
[13:49.080 --> 13:50.320]  We don't have time to review it.
[13:50.320 --> 13:51.800]  We don't have time to look at questions.
[13:51.800 --> 13:53.480]  You've been meeting with the witness.
[13:53.480 --> 13:54.960]  Do we get anything here?
[13:54.960 --> 13:59.080]  And Elijah Cummings just says, no, I'm in charge.
[13:59.080 --> 14:00.080]  I'm the Democrat.
[14:00.080 --> 14:01.280]  I'm the boss, like AOC.
[14:01.280 --> 14:02.920]  I'm the boss.
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.880]  The Democrats are fully exposing themselves as fascist authoritarians today.
[14:08.880 --> 14:13.440]  So there is going to be massive blowback from this, and let me tell you, oh, folks, we're
[14:13.440 --> 14:15.200]  going to get into all of it.
[14:15.200 --> 14:22.320]  Before we do that, though, we need to fuel the engine here at InfoWars with your supported
[14:22.320 --> 14:23.320]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[14:35.880 --> 14:38.760]  boxes or more, 40% off.

[14:42.960 --> 14:49.280]  and a little worried, well, maybe insurance you can eat will give you a little ease.

[14:54.160 --> 14:56.640]  We've got great hats, great t-shirts.
[14:56.640 --> 15:02.160]  The store is so big now, it's almost impossible to sit here in a minute and even get to like
[15:02.160 --> 15:04.280]  a quarter of the stuff we offer.
[15:04.280 --> 15:08.840]  Cold items like shampoo and toothpaste, it's all natural, it's all organic.
[15:08.840 --> 15:13.640]  Air filters, water filters, you've seen the stories about the stuff in the water that's
[15:13.640 --> 15:15.960]  no good, the glyphosates and everything.
[15:15.960 --> 15:20.440]  You've seen the stories about the air and the average American home being so polluted,
[15:20.440 --> 15:23.360]  it's equivalent to a major U.S. city.
[15:23.360 --> 15:27.280]  So we just say, hey look, there's bad stuff in the water, we don't want to drink it, you
[15:27.280 --> 15:30.520]  don't want to drink it, here's the best water filter for the best price, here's the best
[15:30.520 --> 15:32.160]  air filter for the best price.
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.800]  In the break, I've got a long day today, because I'm going to be hosting the Alex Jones show
[15:36.800 --> 15:39.080]  and then I'm going to be hosting the War Room, so in the break I'm going to take my
[15:39.080 --> 15:45.480]  turbo force, which is 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com, and it will energize me for the next seven
[15:45.480 --> 15:49.000]  hours that I'll be live here at InfoWars.com slash show.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.800]  I'm banned, I'm totally banned on Facebook and YouTube, so you know, InfoWars.com slash
[15:54.800 --> 15:57.440]  show is the last place I can go to broadcast.
[15:57.440 --> 16:03.560]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[16:03.560 --> 16:04.640]  my mother's house.
[16:04.640 --> 16:09.160]  I sued the IRS in one, I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.160 --> 16:12.680]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax
[16:12.680 --> 16:14.680]  problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:14.680 --> 16:16.000]  I can help you too.
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.120]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[16:20.120 --> 16:21.120]  tax case.
[16:21.120 --> 16:29.120]  Call 834 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:29.120 --> 16:34.480]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[16:34.480 --> 16:35.480]  the world.
[16:35.480 --> 16:38.520]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[16:38.520 --> 16:44.480]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[16:44.480 --> 16:48.280]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[16:48.280 --> 16:49.280]  Was there ever a vote?
[16:49.280 --> 16:50.800]  Who do we fight for?
[16:50.800 --> 16:57.400]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available
[16:57.400 --> 16:58.960]  at Amazon Books.
[16:58.960 --> 17:04.160]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists, get back to nature, expand your horizons with

[17:58.440 --> 18:06.040]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[18:06.040 --> 18:10.640]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can

[18:12.560 --> 18:18.000]  TurboForce from InfoWarsLife is a powerful mix in energy packet that utilizes vitamins,

[18:38.080 --> 18:41.880]  up on whenever you need a boost.
[18:41.880 --> 19:04.600]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.840]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[19:08.840 --> 19:13.920]  I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every
[19:13.920 --> 19:20.120]  day but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[19:20.120 --> 19:24.320]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[19:24.320 --> 19:28.480]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[19:28.480 --> 19:33.480]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[19:33.480 --> 19:40.720]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[19:40.720 --> 19:44.720]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[19:44.720 --> 19:48.400]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.

[19:53.680 --> 20:03.560]  Reach the SuperMail in you with SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com.
[20:03.560 --> 20:09.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:09.600 --> 20:19.520]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance
[20:19.520 --> 20:26.520]  and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[20:26.520 --> 20:32.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to listen to me very, very carefully because what I'm
[20:32.560 --> 20:37.800]  about to tell you is a matter of life and death.
[20:37.800 --> 20:42.280]  Now a lot of people will tell you they're on target, a lot of folks will tell you that
[20:42.280 --> 20:48.200]  they've got the answers, but they don't have the answers.
[20:48.200 --> 20:52.920]  I do have the answers and that's not an arrogant statement.
[20:52.920 --> 20:58.240]  If I've got the part that works on a car that's broken down and I know it's the part that
[20:58.240 --> 21:02.920]  works because I've tested it and there's a hundred idiots out there trying to put parts
[21:02.920 --> 21:08.320]  on it that aren't from the same car and don't work, I'm going to say, hey, listen, I've
[21:08.320 --> 21:13.280]  got the part that works, I know what the hell I'm talking about.
[21:13.280 --> 21:18.160]  Why do you think the establishment wants us off here?
[21:18.160 --> 21:22.440]  Because they get you watching football and they get all of us watching Dancing with the
[21:22.440 --> 21:30.160]  Stars, which is fine, but everybody's experts on that instead of defense intelligence and
[21:30.160 --> 21:39.720]  international commerce and the rule of law, cancer viruses, space stations, things that
[21:39.720 --> 21:45.320]  are really going on in the real world by the technocracy that runs things and governs things
[21:45.320 --> 21:47.800]  and decides the direction of the world.
[21:47.800 --> 21:51.160]  We had kings and queens and elites that would decide the direction of the world and they
[21:51.160 --> 21:57.480]  kept us in feudalism in a dark age and then 500 years ago the Gutenberg press came along
[21:57.480 --> 22:03.800]  in Europe and challenged the monopoly of the crown and the church and we came out of the
[22:03.800 --> 22:09.400]  dark age into the Renaissance and you go back, I'm going to give you the secret to everything,
[22:09.400 --> 22:14.720]  you go back to Plato 2300 years ago in Greece, the king of philosophers and he said, humans
[22:14.720 --> 22:19.840]  are crushing the breast of Mother Earth, the earth's overpopulated, even though there
[22:19.840 --> 22:23.840]  are probably 20 million people on the planet then instead of 7.5 billion, they said we
[22:23.840 --> 22:27.960]  need to kill all the dumb people and sometimes I kind of agree with that, but see here's
[22:27.960 --> 22:33.160]  the problem, the globalists are actually trying to make us dumb.
[22:33.160 --> 22:40.760]  The parlor eugenics on the outside is that, oh, we're trying to make people smarter.
[22:40.760 --> 22:45.600]  No, no, no, they want to control society and civilization.
[22:45.600 --> 22:51.520]  So we've seen AOC, you know, that's the latest like a method in Congress from New York, tell
[22:51.520 --> 22:54.360]  us we don't need to have kids anymore because the world's ending in 12 years.
[22:54.360 --> 22:56.600]  They want you to give up.
[22:56.600 --> 23:01.840]  They want you to have a fatalistic view and then they hit you with electromagnetic radiation,
[23:01.840 --> 23:06.520]  they hit you with the GMO, they hit you with tainted vaccines, they hit you with the brainwashing,
[23:06.520 --> 23:13.480]  the race war, the culture war, the demoralization, so they can dominate and control you, divide
[23:13.480 --> 23:19.720]  and conquer you and then they hit you with malnutrition.
[23:19.720 --> 23:21.560]  Everybody knows if you don't have water, you die.
[23:21.560 --> 23:23.760]  If you don't have air, you die.
[23:23.760 --> 23:27.400]  Well, if you don't have vitamin C, you end up dying in a few months and if you don't
[23:27.400 --> 23:32.480]  have iodine, folks, an essential element, you're screwed and that's what's so exciting
[23:32.480 --> 23:38.600]  is that if they can't abort a baby before it's born, well, hell, now, kill it after
[23:38.600 --> 23:39.600]  it's born.
[23:39.600 --> 23:41.520]  That's what the Democrats in the Senate just voted to do.
[23:41.520 --> 23:46.120]  They agree with the Democrats in Virginia and New York kill babies after they're born.
[23:46.120 --> 23:47.120]  That's the bad news.
[23:47.120 --> 23:51.120]  The good news is there's all these other ways they're getting at us.
[23:51.120 --> 23:56.400]  And back when the government wasn't pure evil, they put iodine in the salt by law and it
[23:56.400 --> 24:01.000]  boosted IQs on average 15 points and cut out all these burnt effects and it's because
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.760]  if you don't have iodine in many cases, if you have electrochemical problems in the brain,
[24:04.760 --> 24:06.240]  it's the fact you die.
[24:06.240 --> 24:12.080]  Oh, but they give you the bad halogen fluoride that lowers IQ, lowers fertility.
[24:12.080 --> 24:13.480]  So here's the good news.
[24:13.480 --> 24:17.560]  I'm going to play this trolling green piece with David Knight and myself and others.
[24:17.560 --> 24:18.560]  It's about four years old.
[24:18.560 --> 24:20.200]  It's very powerful.
[24:20.200 --> 24:23.560]  That breaks down how the dystopia we warned you of is now here.
[24:23.560 --> 24:24.560]  They're rolling it out.
[24:24.560 --> 24:28.640]  But the good news is, I told you almost two years ago, I was having fights with the oil
[24:28.640 --> 24:31.360]  companies that get the pure deep breath crystal iodine.
[24:31.360 --> 24:32.360]  Nobody else has.
[24:32.360 --> 24:33.720]  It's atomic.
[24:33.720 --> 24:38.400]  And we went to fisticuffs with them, came out with a new iodine that's still really
[24:38.400 --> 24:40.920]  good at some of the deep breath crystal and two other types.
[24:40.920 --> 24:44.480]  We could have made it pure deep breath crystal, but it's from another manufacturer.
[24:44.480 --> 24:45.680]  And so some folks like it.
[24:45.680 --> 24:46.680]  Some folks don't.
[24:46.680 --> 24:47.680]  It's X3.
[24:47.680 --> 24:53.320]  I got old fashioned X2, pure, same manufacturer, same oil company, 12,000 feet.
[24:53.320 --> 24:54.320]  It's amazing.
[24:54.320 --> 24:55.320]  M4store.com.
[24:55.320 --> 24:57.200]  So they can pull all the stuff they're going to do all day.
[24:57.200 --> 25:03.920]  But God's given us things like iodine, like oxygen, like water, like food, like our mothers,
[25:03.920 --> 25:05.280]  like our fathers.
[25:05.280 --> 25:07.600]  That is what gives us sustenance.
[25:07.600 --> 25:09.600]  And X2 is back.
[25:09.600 --> 25:10.600]  It's been produced.
[25:10.600 --> 25:11.600]  The labels are being put on today.
[25:11.600 --> 25:17.840]  You can pre-order at m4store.com, m4slife.com, and the 18-wheeler leaves tomorrow from the
[25:17.840 --> 25:20.360]  Rocky Mountains to deliver it to Austin.
[25:20.360 --> 25:24.960]  So as early as the week from now, let's just say a week and a half from now, X2 is back
[25:24.960 --> 25:33.480]  by the grace of God and all of our prayers, X2, m4slife.com, m4store.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[25:33.480 --> 25:37.440]  Get your X2 at m4store.com, and while you're ready, get other things that are amazing,
[25:37.440 --> 25:41.560]  like the purest, best fish oils for adults and children.
[25:41.560 --> 25:42.560]  The very best turmeric.
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.080]  We've got 50% off bodies right now, or alpha power and all the great compounds it has for
[25:47.080 --> 25:49.480]  men and women for stamina, libido energy.
[25:49.480 --> 25:52.240]  That's 50% off at m4store.com.
[25:52.240 --> 25:55.960]  So X2 is back, ladies and gentlemen, and it helps fund the M4 War, so thanks for your
[25:55.960 --> 25:56.960]  support.
[25:56.960 --> 26:03.040]  Back to Owen, the live broadcast after this important piece on Soylent Green and how this
[26:03.040 --> 26:06.200]  dystopic nightmare has now come true.
[26:06.200 --> 26:11.600]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[26:11.600 --> 26:15.560]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[26:15.560 --> 26:21.280]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals
[26:21.280 --> 26:22.280]  in the UK.
[26:22.280 --> 26:26.760]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[26:26.760 --> 26:31.720]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[26:31.720 --> 26:34.320]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[26:34.320 --> 26:37.120]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[26:37.120 --> 26:41.720]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[26:41.720 --> 26:44.720]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[26:44.720 --> 26:47.720]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[26:47.720 --> 26:50.720]  You must evacuate the area.
[26:50.720 --> 26:53.640]  It's really important.
[26:53.640 --> 27:01.240]  That the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group Company, are not allowed to know
[27:01.240 --> 27:05.120]  what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring, but we already know.
[27:05.120 --> 27:07.080]  So enjoy the flavor.
[27:07.080 --> 27:10.280]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels
[27:10.280 --> 27:11.520]  and sales taxes.
[27:11.520 --> 27:13.520]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[27:13.520 --> 27:15.400]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[27:15.400 --> 27:16.720]  I'm for regular suicide.
[27:16.720 --> 27:18.720]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[27:18.720 --> 27:23.120]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would
[27:23.120 --> 27:30.160]  it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[27:30.160 --> 27:34.480]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[27:34.480 --> 27:49.000]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.640]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[27:51.640 --> 27:56.480]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[27:56.480 --> 27:59.080]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[27:59.080 --> 28:04.040]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison
[28:04.040 --> 28:08.440]  guards, on the quiz-lings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[28:08.440 --> 28:11.440]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[28:11.440 --> 28:13.440]  The scoops are on their way.
[28:13.440 --> 28:15.440]  The scoops are on their way.
[28:15.440 --> 28:19.440]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[28:19.440 --> 28:22.760]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[28:22.760 --> 28:25.760]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[28:25.760 --> 28:27.760]  We've got to stop them.
[28:27.760 --> 28:28.760]  Come on.
[28:28.760 --> 28:32.760]  It is my secret name, Soylent Green.
[28:32.760 --> 28:34.760]  It is Soylent Green is people.
[28:34.760 --> 28:44.760]  I just think they'll be pretty easily killed, but who are they going to tell them?
[28:44.760 --> 28:51.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the recess is over in the Cohen testimony.
[28:51.760 --> 28:55.760]  When we come back from this short break, we will go back live.
[28:55.760 --> 28:59.760]  Don't Go Anywhere is the Alex Jones Show.
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.760]  Disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:04.760 --> 29:06.760]  may not be fully detected by you.
[29:06.760 --> 29:08.760]  But the symptoms are there.
[29:08.760 --> 29:13.760]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:13.760 --> 29:16.760]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:16.760 --> 29:21.760]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:21.760 --> 29:22.760]  across America.
[29:22.760 --> 29:24.760]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:24.760 --> 29:26.760]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.760 --> 29:30.760]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and how much healthier I feel.
[29:30.760 --> 29:32.760]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:32.760 --> 29:38.760]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[29:38.760 --> 29:57.760]  way of keeping their cardiovascular system healthy.
[30:09.760 --> 30:16.760]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy
[30:16.760 --> 30:18.760]  drinks and energy supplements.
[30:18.760 --> 30:24.760]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that
[30:24.760 --> 30:28.760]  sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[30:28.760 --> 30:35.760]  We have developed hands down from our research the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout
[30:35.760 --> 30:37.760]  and beyond system in the world.
[30:37.760 --> 30:39.760]  There's nothing else like it.
[30:39.760 --> 30:40.760]  You must experience it.
[30:40.760 --> 30:45.760]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in with fruit juice
[30:45.760 --> 30:47.760]  or water, whatever you'd like.
[30:47.760 --> 30:49.760]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[30:49.760 --> 30:50.760]  It lasts 10 hours.
[30:50.760 --> 30:54.760]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[30:54.760 --> 30:56.760]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[30:56.760 --> 31:07.760]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made,

[31:48.760 --> 31:56.760]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power at 50% off, only at the InfoWars store.
[32:18.760 --> 32:25.760]  Arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[32:25.760 --> 32:27.760]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[32:27.760 --> 32:31.760]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[32:31.760 --> 32:35.760]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[32:35.760 --> 32:42.760]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[32:42.760 --> 32:44.760]  This country is in a war.
[32:44.760 --> 32:47.760]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you,
[32:47.760 --> 32:52.760]  if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us,
[32:52.760 --> 32:54.760]  in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[32:54.760 --> 33:20.760]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. InfoWarsStore.com. Thank you.
[33:20.760 --> 33:25.760]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones.
[33:25.760 --> 33:29.760]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[33:29.760 --> 33:33.760]  So we're going to go back to this trojan testimony, but I got to be honest with you folks.
[33:33.760 --> 33:37.760]  There's so much other stuff happening that's really more relevant than this.
[33:37.760 --> 33:40.760]  This is just kind of like the circus act right now.
[33:40.760 --> 33:44.760]  The three-ring circus that everyone's paying attention to. Everybody wants to watch, so I get it.
[33:44.760 --> 33:48.760]  And we're going to go back to it live here, but there's so much other stuff going on.
[33:48.760 --> 33:58.760]  Plus, we've got three powerful segments, almost an hour of content from Robert Barnes, who was in studio yesterday.
[33:58.760 --> 34:05.760]  This guy is sharp as a tack. I mean, this guy is with it and tuned in.
[34:05.760 --> 34:17.760]  A great intellectual and a great lawyer and just really a great man who is going to be breaking down a lot of stuff when it comes to the legalities
[34:17.760 --> 34:23.760]  that we're dealing with here when it comes to censorship and fair trade practices,
[34:23.760 --> 34:29.760]  which is also in the news today as a new FTC task force has just been formed to take on tech monopoly.
[34:29.760 --> 34:35.760]  So we're going to cover all that plus still big announcement, big, exciting stuff coming from Alex Jones.
[34:35.760 --> 34:43.760]  I'm not allowed to discuss it quite yet, but you will find out shortly where Alex is and why.
[34:43.760 --> 34:56.760]  And then there's just other news that's developing right now, and there's a, well, let's just go back live now to the three-ring circus that is the Michael Cohen testimony.
[34:56.760 --> 35:05.760]  Saying that to me for many, many months, and at the end of the day, I knew exactly what he wanted me to say.
[35:05.760 --> 35:08.760]  And why was Mr. Sekalo in the meeting?
[35:08.760 --> 35:18.760]  Because he was going to be representing Mr. Trump going forward as one of his personal attorneys in this matter.
[35:18.760 --> 35:20.760]  So it was sort of a handoff.
[35:20.760 --> 35:22.760]  Correct.
[35:22.760 --> 35:25.760]  In any way, final question to the president.
[35:25.760 --> 35:31.760]  So, you know, here, look, ladies and gentlemen, we played Jim Jordan's opening statements here.
[35:31.760 --> 35:33.760]  We're going to go back to the testimony here in a second.
[35:33.760 --> 35:44.760]  Just so we can get some of this out there before we move on to other topics, because I think it's beginning to get a little bit redundant.
[35:44.760 --> 35:51.760]  Elijah Cummings has really exposed himself in this testimony here.
[35:51.760 --> 35:55.760]  He broke the rules in his first ever hearing as the head of this committee.
[35:55.760 --> 36:03.760]  He's acted like a authoritarian fascist while in control of this committee with the gavel.
[36:03.760 --> 36:06.760]  And he lies about Republicans.
[36:06.760 --> 36:08.760]  He said Republicans don't want to hear from Cohen.
[36:08.760 --> 36:09.760]  Well, that was an outright lie.
[36:09.760 --> 36:17.760]  What Jim Jordan said was, hey, can we postpone this so that we can follow the rules of this committee, which both parties agreed to,
[36:17.760 --> 36:27.760]  which was we had 24 hours to review the witness testimony statements before we come to this room and hear the testimony so that we can prepare questions, etc.
[36:27.760 --> 36:33.760]  The Democrats have been meeting with Cohen for weeks, months, maybe even years.
[36:33.760 --> 36:36.760]  And Cohen admitted that today when questioned.
[36:36.760 --> 36:43.760]  So the Democrats got the leaked testimony, even CNN got the leaked testimony.
[36:43.760 --> 36:48.760]  And they gave it to the Republicans just an hour before the testimony began.
[36:48.760 --> 36:50.760]  That's against the rules.
[36:50.760 --> 36:58.760]  And so Jim Jordan says, well, can we postpone this so that we can review the testimony and know what we can even ask this witness here today?
[36:58.760 --> 37:00.760]  And Elijah Cummings says no.
[37:00.760 --> 37:02.760]  And then moves on.
[37:02.760 --> 37:04.760]  So he's blatantly breaking the rules.
[37:04.760 --> 37:12.760]  And then he makes another statement saying that Republicans don't want to hear from Cohen, even though Jim Jordan specifically said we want to hear from Cohen.
[37:12.760 --> 37:14.760]  We want to question Cohen.
[37:14.760 --> 37:20.760]  You guys are the ones that brought this convicted liar in front of this committee.
[37:20.760 --> 37:21.760]  Not me.
[37:21.760 --> 37:22.760]  You did that Cummings.
[37:22.760 --> 37:23.760]  Of course we want to question him.
[37:23.760 --> 37:26.760]  But then Cummings says the Republicans are trying to avoid questioning him.
[37:26.760 --> 37:29.760]  And Jordan's like, no, we want to follow the rules of this committee.
[37:29.760 --> 37:36.760]  And again, how did CNN get this leaked testimony, folks?
[37:36.760 --> 37:37.760]  This is unheard of.
[37:37.760 --> 37:51.760]  So not only is Cohen meeting with Democrats this entire process, they're leaking his testimony to CNN before the Republicans in the committee even get to see it, which is against the rules.
[37:51.760 --> 37:58.760]  And again, why is he meeting with the Democrats like this?
[37:58.760 --> 38:06.760]  So let's go back live to the Cohen testimony.
[38:06.760 --> 38:13.760]  Is that being a good lawyer to not even consider whether it's legal or not?
[38:13.760 --> 38:15.760]  I didn't work for the campaign.
[38:15.760 --> 38:18.760]  I was working and I was trying to protect Mr. Trump.
[38:18.760 --> 38:23.760]  I sat with Mr. Trump and this goes back all the way to 2011.
[38:23.760 --> 38:26.760]  This wasn't the first scenario with Ms. Daniels.
[38:26.760 --> 38:27.760]  Let's go back then.
[38:27.760 --> 38:33.760]  So my point is this was an ongoing situation.
[38:33.760 --> 38:36.760]  It didn't just start.
[38:36.760 --> 38:39.760]  So again, this is just getting redundant, folks.
[38:39.760 --> 38:44.760]  They keep bringing up the porn star, Stormy Daniels.
[38:44.760 --> 38:46.760]  There's a portrait that they talked about.
[38:46.760 --> 38:47.760]  We'll get into all this.
[38:47.760 --> 38:49.760]  Cohen was disbarred yesterday.
[38:49.760 --> 38:52.760]  But here's the irony.
[38:52.760 --> 39:01.760]  And you know, I don't know if I want to get into this now or later, but it's like this is playing out so perfectly.
[39:01.760 --> 39:11.760]  I mean, it's almost like a movie or a book or something here because all of this crap, they're trying to say, oh, look at what Trump did that was so bad,
[39:11.760 --> 39:18.760]  paying off this porn star, buying this portrait, pretending like there was a big bid on it and all this crap.
[39:18.760 --> 39:28.760]  It's like, if they really want to do this and try to destroy him, do you realize the crap that they can get on Obama, the Clintons, the Bushes?
[39:28.760 --> 39:37.760]  I mean, it's a joke, the stuff that Donald Trump did that they're sitting here acting like is a big deal is like, not even, it's like breadcrumbs of breadcrumbs
[39:37.760 --> 39:39.760]  compared to what the political establishment has been doing in this country.
[39:39.760 --> 39:41.760]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[39:41.760 --> 39:45.760]  Do you really want to take Trump to task on a frickin' portrait?
[39:45.760 --> 39:46.760]  Did he buy it?
[39:46.760 --> 39:47.760]  A portrait?
[39:47.760 --> 39:49.760]  Did he had a straw man bid on it, an auction?
[39:49.760 --> 39:51.760]  Oh my gosh.
[39:51.760 --> 39:55.760]  Bill, I mean, how much money did the Clintons want from Haiti?
[39:55.760 --> 39:58.760]  How much money did Prescott Bush get from the Nazis?
[39:58.760 --> 40:01.760]  I mean, this is a joke.
[40:01.760 --> 40:04.760]  And it's, I'm telling you, it's a car crash in slow motion.
[40:04.760 --> 40:11.760]  I don't even know if Trump knew what he was getting himself into, folks, and it's just all playing out beautifully.
[40:11.760 --> 40:15.760]  And Trump's going to have the option if he wants to fight back against these people and expose them.
[40:15.760 --> 40:19.760]  So let's go back to the rat called forth here by the Democrats.
[40:19.760 --> 40:25.760]  The Democrats reported to the media on June 12th that those emails would be leaked.
[40:25.760 --> 40:27.760]  So I'm not saying you have fake news.
[40:27.760 --> 40:29.760]  I'm saying you have old news.
[40:29.760 --> 40:31.760]  And there's really not much to that.
[40:31.760 --> 40:36.760]  I would like to yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Higgins.
[40:36.760 --> 40:38.760]  Thank you, sir.
[40:38.760 --> 40:47.760]  Mr. Cohen, you know, quoting you close, I can't earlier said, I spent last week looking through boxes to find documents that would support your accusations.
[40:47.760 --> 40:49.760]  The box is good, sir.
[40:49.760 --> 40:51.760]  Where are those boxes are in your garage?
[40:51.760 --> 40:53.760]  They're in the storage.
[40:53.760 --> 41:00.760]  And are these not boxes that should have been turned over to investigative authorities during the many criminal investigations you've been subject to?
[41:00.760 --> 41:03.760]  Sir, these are the boxes that were returned to me.
[41:03.760 --> 41:10.760]  If they include data pertinent to crimes that you've committed, should they not have been turned over and remanded to investigative authority?
[41:10.760 --> 41:13.760]  Did Mr. Lanny Davis know of these boxes?
[41:13.760 --> 41:16.760]  I'm sorry, you may answer the question.
[41:16.760 --> 41:18.760]  Very well.
[41:18.760 --> 41:23.760]  I can't tell you how many times Cummings has cut a man off from his time and then says, but he can answer the question.
[41:23.760 --> 41:25.760]  And then you know what Cohen says?
[41:25.760 --> 41:27.760]  No, I'm not going to answer the question.
[41:27.760 --> 41:29.760]  Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Cummings for convening.
[41:29.760 --> 41:31.760]  That's at least the third time.
[41:31.760 --> 41:33.760]  Cohen for voluntarily testifying this morning.
[41:33.760 --> 41:35.760]  Oh, voluntarily testifying.
[41:35.760 --> 41:37.760]  Oh, he's voluntarily testifying.
[41:37.760 --> 41:39.760]  This is all part of a big plea bargain, folks.
[41:39.760 --> 41:41.760]  This is a joke.
[41:41.760 --> 41:43.760]  These Democrats think you are an idiot.
[41:43.760 --> 41:46.760]  And special counsel means you are the attorney for him. Is that right?
[41:46.760 --> 41:53.760]  Just means I was there in order to handle matters that he felt were significant and important to him individually.
[41:53.760 --> 41:55.760]  And those included legal matters?
[41:55.760 --> 41:56.760]  Yes, sir.
[41:56.760 --> 42:03.760]  Sir, as a former attorney, you're familiar with legal documents known as non-disclosure agreements or NDAs. Is that right?
[42:03.760 --> 42:04.760]  Yes.
[42:04.760 --> 42:11.760]  Sir, I'm sure you know that NDAs properly written in scope can be reasonable in certain business contexts,
[42:11.760 --> 42:16.760]  but they can also be abused to create a chilling effect to silence people.
[42:16.760 --> 42:22.760]  Yes, yes, Donald Trump, a billionaire, pull him out.
[42:22.760 --> 42:27.760]  Donald Trump, a billionaire, had some people sign some non-disclosure agreements.
[42:27.760 --> 42:29.760]  He is a bad guy.
[42:29.760 --> 42:34.760]  Meanwhile, millions of dollars, tens of millions of dollars spent,
[42:34.760 --> 42:39.760]  taxpayer dollars spent to protect congressmen and women accused of sexual assault.
[42:39.760 --> 42:41.760]  Where are the hearings on that?
[42:41.760 --> 42:43.760]  Where are the investigations into that?
[42:43.760 --> 42:45.760]  Where is the national press on that?
[42:45.760 --> 42:46.760]  Nowhere.
[42:46.760 --> 42:48.760]  They all want to get Trump.
[42:48.760 --> 42:50.760]  It's an unbelievable game.
[42:50.760 --> 42:52.760]  It's a big con game.
[42:52.760 --> 42:54.760]  It's called the Get Trump game.
[42:54.760 --> 42:55.760]  But guess what?
[42:55.760 --> 43:24.760]  America's getting sick of it.
