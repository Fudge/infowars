[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:41.160]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are
[00:41.160 --> 00:49.160]  live and we are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday the 19th day of December 2013
[00:49.160 --> 00:57.160]  worldwide transmission and the Lord willing we will be here for the next three hours as we
[00:57.160 --> 01:06.720]  are Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. guest today we are of course going to have the
[01:06.720 --> 01:14.680]  wrestler join us Glen Jacobs and of course he's been involved with libertarians for a while
[01:14.680 --> 01:21.000]  Kane I learned about a year ago that he was a listener from my old buddy Steve Wayne in Tennessee
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.240]  but we saw him speaking at some big national libertarian events and taught him interesting to
[01:26.240 --> 01:32.440]  reach out to him so he did he's gonna come on and get us his take on the world and then we are
[01:32.440 --> 01:40.720]  also going to have Paul Jenkins who started veteran beer company where it is a company that
[01:40.720 --> 01:48.160]  only hires veterans so that they can actually have a job in the economy and it's this type of
[01:48.160 --> 01:55.160]  idea where different groups and organizations form companies and then form coalitions where
[01:55.160 --> 02:01.120]  you buy from those companies give their high quality products that will unseat the new
[02:01.120 --> 02:06.600]  world order corporates see they sell us on only buying in to what they promote what they push and
[02:06.600 --> 02:11.720]  that is really the ultimate form of slavery and that's why under agenda 21 they're trying to shut
[02:11.720 --> 02:16.320]  down family farms they're trying to shut down washing your own car they're trying to shut down
[02:16.320 --> 02:24.080]  lemonade stands it's all about making normal human activities illegal and it's the essence of the
[02:24.080 --> 02:32.240]  tyranny that we face as a society they've made Air Force bases across the US and now the Marine
[02:32.240 --> 02:39.320]  Corps base slash Army bases they're both there at Guantanamo Bay Cuba they had a nativity scene
[02:39.320 --> 02:44.640]  that's been removed because troops complained somebody complained it was offensive well
[02:44.640 --> 02:51.080]  if it's offensive move to North Korea but it's just an example of the tyranny of modern political
[02:51.080 --> 02:56.240]  correctness it has nothing to do with liberty and everything to do with tyranny I mean where
[02:56.240 --> 03:02.360]  you'll see a teacher in an argument that Santa Claus isn't white saying the mythical character
[03:02.360 --> 03:09.400]  of Santa Claus is from the north and he's white and then the teacher says he's white so she's
[03:09.400 --> 03:17.600]  suspended this is the political mind control and if you look at drugs report calm they're
[03:17.600 --> 03:22.520]  covering duck dynasty that I know is about the hottest thing since sliced bread and it's so
[03:22.520 --> 03:30.440]  shocking that these guys talk about God talk about Jesus there's obviously been behind the scenes
[03:30.440 --> 03:34.680]  attempts to get them to shut up about it they snubbed Barbara Walters or one of them dead and
[03:34.680 --> 03:42.720]  it just shows how controlled this society is that it's a firestorm when somebody is a Christian
[03:42.720 --> 03:47.880]  and says they desire a woman not a man I mean whether you agree with that or disagree it's
[03:47.880 --> 03:55.360]  just freedom of speech whatever happened to whatever happened to being quote tolerant
[03:55.360 --> 04:01.920]  well no tolerant now means adopting what the globalist push and social engineering and there's
[04:01.920 --> 04:06.720]  a real backlash against it with most the young quote liberals I know they're actually all getting
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.680]  into guns now they're not liberals anymore or establishment liberals they're more classical
[04:10.680 --> 04:19.600]  liberals and being anti-establishment is the way to go I was actually having a business meeting
[04:19.600 --> 04:25.240]  in a restaurant slash bar last night that was definitely not a Christian motif they were playing
[04:25.240 --> 04:34.720]  Christian carols in the bar that normally plays rock and roll now why were they doing that because
[04:34.720 --> 04:40.960]  people are sick of it plus even if you're not a Christian those are pretty sounding carols can
[04:40.960 --> 04:47.200]  we get some of those queued up today I want to play some today because it just shows how
[04:47.200 --> 04:52.920]  they're just overriding any culture that the globalist don't control to sell us their plastic
[04:52.920 --> 05:01.320]  dead culture we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen stay with us the facts are in the
[05:01.320 --> 05:07.240]  studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating
[05:07.240 --> 05:12.840]  the health and cognitive ability of the American people so why are the social engineers adding
[05:12.840 --> 05:19.240]  it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on
[05:19.240 --> 05:23.720]  we may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to
[05:23.720 --> 05:29.280]  get it out of our bodies I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive info wars live fluoride

[07:10.880 --> 07:16.720]  what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924
[07:16.720 --> 07:22.000]  the federal government did the right thing and encourage salt producers to add iodine
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.120]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented
[07:28.120 --> 07:34.840]  a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine
[07:34.840 --> 07:41.480]  is important unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent iodine was the answer for myself and

[08:35.920 --> 08:52.480]  we are playing Christian music at Christmas Christian Christ Christmas Christ Christian
[08:52.480 --> 09:07.560]  Christmas Jesus Christ our Lord and savior not Obama not the state not Hitler not mouse
[09:07.560 --> 09:17.000]  a tongue not Sigmund Freud ladies and gentlemen we talk about McCarthy and the Red Scare and
[09:17.000 --> 09:23.640]  the House Committee on the Senate Committee on un-American activities and persecuting
[09:23.640 --> 09:28.880]  and blacklisting people if they were communist and it obviously went too far in some cases
[09:28.880 --> 09:33.480]  and was un-American even though those groups are trying to overthrow the republic itself
[09:33.480 --> 09:39.720]  you can't become the tyranny to stop the tyranny but he meant well undoubtedly and the Russian
[09:39.720 --> 09:44.280]  files are declassified in the last eight years showing indeed most of the people he was targeting
[09:44.280 --> 09:58.080]  were KGB agents now that said in this country if you have a dart gun that shoots plastic
[09:58.080 --> 10:04.800]  darts nerf gun in your backyard even in areas like Texas and a trendy sees you and friends
[10:04.800 --> 10:10.600]  running around playing games cowboys and Indians cops and robbers that's what we play we were
[10:10.600 --> 10:16.000]  kids now it's all basically superhero stuff I'm the Green Lantern I'm Galactus or whatever
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.880]  I mean I see the kids running around doing this or they think they're the X-Men or their
[10:21.880 --> 10:29.960]  Spider-Man versus the Goblin the Green Goblin you get the police called on you you get arrested
[10:29.960 --> 10:37.160]  or your toy guns taken that are bright orange and if the school gets titled to by a neighbor
[10:37.160 --> 10:45.080]  you get suspended from school and then charged with truancy when the truancy laws say if
[10:45.080 --> 10:49.520]  you don't go to school for on average twelve absences in a semester that's the average
[10:49.520 --> 10:54.640]  state law 16 in Texas last time I checked then your parents can be criminally charged
[10:54.640 --> 11:00.040]  so they illegally kick you out of school and then charge you with being truant for not
[11:00.040 --> 11:06.600]  being at school and the parents are like lambs to the slaughter and go in and sign agreements
[11:06.600 --> 11:11.200]  to put their kids on probation ruining their lives basically while a criminal school and
[11:11.200 --> 11:19.120]  criminal administrators use color of law fraud to trick you into a furred adjudification
[11:19.120 --> 11:23.960]  so that when you do one thing you automatically agree to go on probation and pay tens of thousands
[11:23.960 --> 11:29.120]  of dollars this is criminal racketeering you're like what does that have to do with the red
[11:29.120 --> 11:33.840]  scare when you go to have a baby they're spying on you with the nurses putting data oh do
[11:33.840 --> 11:37.440]  you have enough money get along with your husband I'm your friend you can tell me honey
[11:37.440 --> 11:46.400]  you say yeah we've been arguing we're broke your kid is gone at birth all fraud all criminal
[11:46.400 --> 11:51.320]  all over the nation they're pulling down nativity scenes all over military bases there some towns
[11:51.320 --> 11:55.480]  are pushing and suing that make people take crosses down off their own property saying
[11:55.480 --> 12:02.200]  it's offensive there is a total war on Christianity and the cross because they've picked that to
[12:02.200 --> 12:06.080]  bring it down because they believe it's above the state just like they've picked the m4
[12:06.080 --> 12:11.680]  ar-15 as the symbol of all evil and all murder even though it's all assault weapons are used
[12:11.680 --> 12:17.320]  in less than two percent of the crimes FBI statistics done crimes two percent it's shotguns
[12:17.320 --> 12:21.840]  and handguns ladies and gentlemen the vast majority that's what criminals use the average
[12:21.840 --> 12:26.240]  idiot criminal doesn't know how to use a gun they use a shotgun because they can't miss
[12:26.240 --> 12:31.200]  or they want to conceal little handgun because all the dumb idiots you know pimps and people
[12:31.200 --> 12:35.880]  you know think that's the right gun to have because they see cops with them ladies and
[12:35.880 --> 12:40.080]  gentlemen this is the fraud they're persecuting gun owners they're persecuting Christians
[12:40.080 --> 12:49.080]  and if they can ban the m4 carbine the ar-15 they can ban them all and if they can all
[12:49.080 --> 12:54.200]  over the nation oh you gave out Christmas cards that said Merry Christmas we are suspending
[12:54.200 --> 12:59.360]  you oh you brought a Bible to school that you were reading at lunch we're taking the
[12:59.360 --> 13:03.680]  Bible and suspending you for a week I see that article every two weeks that's that's
[13:03.680 --> 13:11.080]  happening constantly folks that the school can't say we have an official religion and
[13:11.080 --> 13:16.720]  push it you can wear a cross around your neck you can pray to Mecca during the lunch break
[13:16.720 --> 13:22.280]  if you want you can even go out in the jungle gym if you want and bow to Satan you can worship
[13:22.280 --> 13:29.240]  rocks you can worship the sky you can worship the mountain and crumb you can worship whatever
[13:29.240 --> 13:34.840]  you want under the First Amendment and the people that call themselves liberal that are
[13:34.840 --> 13:41.200]  at war with religion are only doing it because they want to be above religion they want the
[13:41.200 --> 13:47.240]  state to be God that's what communists and fascists and authoritarian countries always
[13:47.240 --> 13:54.480]  do they want to be God and have you dependent and live off the welfare check or live off
[13:54.480 --> 13:58.040]  the corporate check or live off the government pension fund that they can take away whenever
[13:58.040 --> 14:02.640]  they want even though they took your money in 30 years of service in the military or
[14:02.640 --> 14:08.360]  the government or wherever and put your money in there they're now telling you it's an entitlement
[14:08.360 --> 14:13.000]  you're not going to get it you're just like some welfare mom you understand that ladies
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.920]  and gentlemen and so now this is a big deal I saw the controversy yesterday on drugs report
[14:19.920 --> 14:28.400]  dot com saw it all over the news after that and now A&E has placed duck dynasty patriarch
[14:28.400 --> 14:34.320]  Phil Robertson on indefinite hiatus following anti gay remarks he made in a recent profile
[14:34.320 --> 14:40.600]  on gq and the entire family and I know they're listeners I've been told they are the we ought
[14:40.600 --> 14:47.320]  to reach out to them now reach out to him now the entire family should now leave and
[14:47.320 --> 14:53.080]  break their contract with this channel any under the first amendment they'll be rock
[14:53.080 --> 14:58.880]  stars bigger than ever and come out with their own network just like Glenn Beck has done
[14:58.880 --> 15:05.240]  I'm telling you you double down do what we've done you do not need them your entrepreneurs
[15:05.240 --> 15:10.960]  you're smart you're the number one show in cable history after the Bible that was number
[15:10.960 --> 15:18.760]  two you see this is a culture war and these globalist want to have the Bible because on
[15:18.760 --> 15:24.960]  cable because they want the record ratings 12 15 20 million viewers I mean NFL that hardly
[15:24.960 --> 15:34.360]  has that and this show had tens of millions of viewers and if you want to have 666 tattooed
[15:34.360 --> 15:39.320]  on your hands and the motorcycle shows that's fine or if you want to promote in children
[15:39.320 --> 15:48.240]  shows gay sex which is pedophilia whether it's heterosexual or homosexual they want to be
[15:48.240 --> 15:53.000]  able to control things and get away with what's seen as radical not even promoting a quote
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  gay agenda it's to overturn the old existing order to bring in the new and if they can
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.800]  get the public schools in the position to teach five-year-olds how to have anal sex
[16:02.800 --> 16:08.760]  which they do and to have and to teach five-year-olds how to masturbate remember Jocelyn elders
[16:08.760 --> 16:13.720]  and two plus two equals five and all the rest of this stuff they can do anything they want
[16:13.720 --> 16:32.720]  and now they can fire suspend indefinitely put into the phantom zone purgatory the main
[16:32.720 --> 16:37.120]  star the most popular guy on duck dynasty and I've only watched a few times I don't watch
[16:37.120 --> 16:41.160]  a lot TV but I follow some of it online you know I've got some of their products I do
[16:41.160 --> 16:53.660]  duck hunt we expect when I have time and the whole issue here is that this is simply outrageous
[16:53.660 --> 17:00.640]  and this sets the precedent to persecute anybody they want and shut anybody they are they want
[17:00.640 --> 17:04.360]  off a television or out of media or out of government or out of industry where they rule
[17:04.360 --> 17:12.320]  and control what is acceptable in this nation and behind the scenes they told him you can't
[17:12.320 --> 17:16.000]  talk about Jesus Christ behind the scenes they said don't talk about God and that's
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.760]  what makes it popular behind the scenes imagine the show is a reality show about a successful
[17:21.760 --> 17:26.240]  family of entrepreneurs and hunters and they put all this stuff on honey boo boo and all
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.720]  of them try to make southerners and white people look bad but instead it's backfired
[17:30.720 --> 17:36.720]  and incredibly popular and so people are now adopting this look and this culture as a rebellion
[17:36.720 --> 17:41.640]  against the system hey it isn't perfect but it's better than being a metro sexual getting
[17:41.640 --> 17:50.960]  bossed around by your wife or girlfriend all day people are sick of it and so what's popular
[17:50.960 --> 17:59.080]  is real Christianity real rugged individualism real americana libertarianism and the system
[17:59.080 --> 18:08.480]  absolutely hates it because any culture especially you know the characters down in mississippi
[18:08.480 --> 18:16.320]  and louisiana that are from you know two centuries ago basically that image doesn't fit with
[18:16.320 --> 18:23.720]  the system that the establishment is trying to push today and let me tell you I'll take
[18:23.720 --> 18:32.160]  the duck dynasty crowd over the public schools teaching five-year-olds how to have anal sex
[18:32.160 --> 18:37.360]  I'll take him any day we have a culture of government feeding on us spying on us getting
[18:37.360 --> 18:41.720]  away with bloody murder demonization of the founders look all the other countries don't
[18:41.720 --> 18:45.800]  follow this and they turn into hell holes and we're going down that same path because
[18:45.800 --> 18:51.480]  the social engineers know if they can take God away from us and gun guns and family it's
[18:51.480 --> 18:59.520]  over it's over A&E has placed duck dynasty patriarch phil Robinson on a death in hiatus
[18:59.520 --> 19:05.600]  following anti gay remarks he made in a recent profile in gq we are extremely disappointed
[19:05.600 --> 19:10.400]  to have read phil robertsons comments in gq which are based on his own personal beliefs
[19:10.400 --> 19:15.640]  and are not reflected in the series duck dynasty A&E said in a statement his personal views
[19:15.640 --> 19:20.840]  and nowhere reflect those of any networks who have always been strong supporters and champions
[19:20.840 --> 19:27.080]  of the lgbt community how about the first amendment the network has placed phil under
[19:27.080 --> 19:31.680]  hiatus from filming indefinitely and I'm telling you the whole family I want an article out
[19:31.680 --> 19:36.800]  about this by adan salazar or or or Watson or any of the folks over there or I want them
[19:36.800 --> 19:44.480]  all to write with their own perspective on it on this new macarthurism because the family
[19:44.480 --> 19:50.680]  needs to leave the show and we need to boycott A&E these are a bunch of anti family anti
[19:50.680 --> 19:56.600]  god people who are anti first amendment and I mean all he said was is I don't get it I
[19:56.600 --> 20:04.920]  like women not men the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic
[20:04.920 --> 20:10.040]  members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the american
[20:10.040 --> 20:15.960]  people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water symbol dumb down the host
[20:15.960 --> 20:21.040]  population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to

[24:40.720 --> 24:46.800]  air on the radio because it's offensive to people and well we've all got a bow to what
[24:46.800 --> 24:52.600]  a minority says we should do because they're so tolerant it's about setting the precedent
[24:52.600 --> 25:00.040]  telling us what we can and can't do the free speech zones all of it this is pure anti liberty
[25:00.040 --> 25:06.080]  anti first amendment garbage masquerading as civil rights i mean my gosh ladies and
[25:06.080 --> 25:11.840]  gentlemen i'll be honest with you i've never had anything against gays and lesbians it's
[25:11.840 --> 25:15.920]  never really been a big subject on my mind if people love each other and care about each
[25:15.920 --> 25:26.080]  other that's their issue but if they were trying to sexualize small children to heterosexual
[25:26.080 --> 25:30.560]  activities i would be very angry and that's what's happening and it's disgusting and there
[25:30.560 --> 25:37.700]  is a radical element leading the quote gay and lesbian community on record that are
[25:37.700 --> 25:44.000]  dominating society pushing their agenda getting in everybody's face beating everybody over
[25:44.000 --> 25:51.760]  the head with their religion and i mean i'm sorry just for me in my own life sex is not
[25:51.760 --> 25:55.360]  what everything orbits around i know rock and roll that's what it's all about all of
[25:55.360 --> 26:02.520]  it and i'm you know 40 years old now turn 40 in february i was a long life i was old
[26:02.520 --> 26:09.000]  when i was 20 done a lot and i'm just sick of it i'm sick of like almost every movie
[26:09.000 --> 26:15.120]  or show or sitcom i happen to see or a show about remodeling houses or i don't let my
[26:15.120 --> 26:19.440]  kids watch much tv but we'll be on vacation and and like flipping through kids shows
[26:19.440 --> 26:24.520]  channels and and there'll be an agenda there and i'm like wow i'm living in the twilight
[26:24.520 --> 26:31.200]  zone and you look at the anchors on cnn and msnbc and it's come out i mean you're not
[26:31.200 --> 26:35.400]  going to be a producer you're not going to be on air unless you're in the club and it's
[26:35.400 --> 26:42.160]  like no wonder everybody's tuning out i mean it just kind of gets old when nothing but
[26:42.160 --> 26:48.280]  gay people are on television and that that's the whole world and then again the globalist
[26:48.280 --> 26:52.840]  in their own documents you can look these up we covered in game 1.5 said in the 60s
[26:52.840 --> 26:56.520]  we're going to promote this agenda to reduce fertility reduce the number of children and
[26:56.520 --> 27:01.560]  in in the family and make the state the unifying center of life it's like they say we're going
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.840]  to ban guns because only the state should have the monopoly of force that's in univir
[27:06.840 --> 27:15.880]  documents july 7th 2001 united nations general disarmament small arms committee and so i mean
[27:15.880 --> 27:21.840]  that's what it is i mean you turn on any sitcom any drama the man's an idiot the man's a moron
[27:21.840 --> 27:29.000]  the woman's the boss and let me tell you women especially watch this and then they repeat
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.400]  everything they've seen because it's like oh this show shows me being the boss this show
[27:33.400 --> 27:38.760]  shows men being a joke they are annihilating your partner they are annihilating your future
[27:38.760 --> 27:43.760]  they are isolating you women and then men buy into it they think if they act like idiots
[27:43.760 --> 27:47.520]  they'll get more women they think they buy more curves like they'll get more women pop
[27:47.520 --> 27:51.400]  occurs at the beach and 100 women show up instantly and now the truth is you just end
[27:51.400 --> 27:57.760]  up with a giant potbelly living alone and these are the images that you can see a corporate
[27:57.760 --> 28:04.840]  push of banning free speech banning christian nativity scenes in people's own yards they're
[28:04.840 --> 28:10.320]  even going after that banning regular human activity banning the first amendment i see
[28:10.320 --> 28:16.720]  every few weeks someone arrested in a public school or a college or even private school
[28:16.720 --> 28:22.120]  because they'll write a fiction essay usually about zombies because that's so popular i've
[28:22.120 --> 28:25.240]  told the story many times i remember writing a story about zombies and winning an award
[28:25.240 --> 28:36.120]  for it in the sixth grade intermediate and my teacher used it as an example of creative
[28:36.120 --> 28:42.640]  writing because myself and my friend uh black friend of mine kori strange was his name sitting
[28:42.640 --> 28:47.120]  beside each other started writing about zombies and about a fictitious high school and how
[28:47.120 --> 28:50.880]  they attacked it now we're in the back of a truck and shooting the zombies with shotguns
[28:50.880 --> 28:54.680]  and he kind of wrote one angle of what was happening in the town in his article and then
[28:54.680 --> 28:58.120]  i wrote another angle in my article and the teacher a week later was like look at this
[28:58.120 --> 29:01.400]  you guys come up and read these stories are part of it this is really good how they're
[29:01.400 --> 29:06.240]  collaborative and are like two different branches like like alternate realities of the same

[35:04.960 --> 35:10.240]  when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh and Phil Robertson gets suspended the politically correct crowd
[35:10.240 --> 35:14.560]  is tolerant of all viewpoints except those they disagree with that's what Louisiana governor
[35:14.560 --> 35:24.520]  Bobby Jindal said of the duck dynasty star Phil Robertson being suspended by A&E so that's
[35:24.520 --> 35:30.960]  what's going on ladies and gentlemen and this is supposed to scare everybody the sales of
[35:30.960 --> 35:36.440]  the records of Hank Williams Jr. only went up when he got kicked off a Monday night football
[35:36.440 --> 35:40.560]  and they put Obama there in its place and promote Obamacare and restricting our guns
[35:40.560 --> 35:53.520]  it goes on and on and on and on and I want to get your take on this 800-259-9231 but
[35:53.520 --> 35:59.720]  I gotta say ladies and gentlemen this is a real attack on free speech and a real attack
[35:59.720 --> 36:10.440]  on all of our rights and it is absolutely shameful that a large portion of the children
[36:10.440 --> 36:16.040]  taken by CPS from good families because the folks want healthy well-adjusted kids that
[36:16.040 --> 36:20.960]  are two three years old are being given you look at the numbers on this to quote gay and
[36:20.960 --> 36:26.640]  lesbian families so they can have kids because they don't and and and I mean if you go look
[36:26.640 --> 36:31.400]  it up in some states as much as 30% of the kids being taken by CPS places like New York
[36:31.400 --> 36:39.640]  California are being given to these couples and literally those of us that are heterosexual
[36:39.640 --> 36:45.760]  are hunted now I mean you know it's bad when a couple guys roll a gay guy and beat them
[36:45.760 --> 36:48.760]  up to rob them because that's their excuse to do it just like it's wrong when black kids
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.240]  go beat up white people because they're white and they deserve it and you want to rob them
[36:52.240 --> 36:56.440]  you always demonize somebody you want to rob but you're not going to see shows about all
[36:56.440 --> 37:05.440]  the two and three-year-olds taken from mommy and daddy and all the CPS groups delivering
[37:05.440 --> 37:13.480]  these children I mean I know there's been right here in Travis County law enforcement
[37:13.480 --> 37:19.520]  people had law enforcement people in over the years who you know would have three kids
[37:19.520 --> 37:24.880]  taken by CPS two women married to each other and they are literally harvesting kids right
[37:24.880 --> 37:28.600]  out of Travis County that they had it up everybody knows what I'm talking about who's
[37:28.600 --> 37:36.440]  in this yeah my point is folks it's unbelievable and and I am literally seen like a human running
[37:36.440 --> 37:40.960]  through the fields and planted the apes being run down with nets thrown on us but it's all
[37:40.960 --> 37:48.600]  done through color law it's all done real cute and funny and we're persecuted we're persecuted
[37:48.600 --> 37:52.960]  ladies and gentlemen and if you study it this is what happened in Rome homosexuality was
[37:52.960 --> 37:57.360]  illegal in Rome first and then they had their golden age of the Republic they took over the
[37:57.360 --> 38:03.280]  known world then they became deck and it's a cycle got into all sorts of stuff marrying
[38:03.280 --> 38:09.520]  their horses I talk about that you know and then the Roman Emperor started saying the
[38:09.520 --> 38:15.600]  nobility has to give us your daughters and sons to raise tax money the rich even had
[38:15.600 --> 38:20.920]  to go be prostitutes for the Emperor it was the demand of sex if you look at the biblical
[38:20.920 --> 38:25.560]  story of Sodom and Gomorrah whether you believe that story or not Sodom and Gomorrah did exist
[38:25.560 --> 38:32.560]  there by the Dead Sea and there's evidence we're destroyed by some calamity and they
[38:32.560 --> 38:39.360]  come to the door and say to the family that had come visiting give us your children then
[38:39.360 --> 38:45.120]  they say by the way who are those beautiful ones we want them who were angels and my point
[38:45.120 --> 38:52.600]  is whether you believe that story or not I mean ancient history books are replete with
[38:52.600 --> 38:58.960]  people coming and demanding your children Hitler took the children the Stalinist took
[38:58.960 --> 39:04.120]  the children the Maoist took the children the Aztecs took the children the Druids took
[39:04.120 --> 39:10.280]  the children the state always wants the children and they're on the news introducing federal
[39:10.280 --> 39:15.640]  and state bills to ban homeschooling right now saying you will get a CPS visit and have
[39:15.640 --> 39:19.880]  to have a license to raise your kids it doesn't matter statistically the most well-adjusted
[39:19.880 --> 39:27.720]  best children Hillary Clinton says you can't Hillary Clinton who on record in 1996 FBI agent
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.280]  quit and went public over this we interviewing and it was confirmed photos were released
[39:33.280 --> 39:41.160]  leaked by the Secret Service of crack pipes and Mao Zedong on the Christmas tree and that's
[39:41.160 --> 39:48.520]  what Satanist have always been into Satanist have always been into defiling the other
[39:48.520 --> 39:53.960]  religion symbols and I don't want to go into what they do you want to look into what Satan
[39:53.960 --> 40:02.200]  is do with Christian artifacts Christian symbols and signets they that's that's the essence
[40:02.200 --> 40:12.520]  of Satanism is defiling other people's articles of faith I'll just leave it at that and that's
[40:12.520 --> 40:17.760]  what they do they defile our children they defile our temples they defile our culture
[40:17.760 --> 40:23.240]  they run all over it and oh it's okay again if they were trying to teach it's a genius
[40:23.240 --> 40:29.280]  plan pedophilia to first second third fourth graders and it was heterosexual they would
[40:29.280 --> 40:33.160]  all be arrested at these public schools but because it's federal curriculum and it's
[40:33.160 --> 40:40.440]  done to create inclusion they can sexualize your tiny child as pervert operators and even
[40:40.440 --> 40:45.160]  if the teachers and people aren't pervert operators themselves consciously they follow
[40:45.160 --> 40:49.080]  it and they do it as part of their political correct religion Democrats are saying they're
[40:49.080 --> 40:54.040]  signing up for Obamacare they'll pay double triple whatever it takes as a sacrament to
[40:54.040 --> 41:01.320]  their Lord and Savior their Messiah as Barbara Walters and Jamie Fox and all of them call
[41:01.320 --> 41:08.280]  him he is a Messiah and what did he do at the gay and lesbian events they have every
[41:08.280 --> 41:12.400]  few weeks at the White House they always have like five and six and seven year olds introduce
[41:12.400 --> 41:19.920]  it and it's always two little boys or two little girls it's never one boy one girl imagine
[41:19.920 --> 41:26.440]  having an event about heterosexual sex or an event for sex outside marriage they'll
[41:26.440 --> 41:32.280]  say we're gonna promote that it's a good thing according to them here we have a little boy
[41:32.280 --> 41:36.320]  little girl together what's the message of that up from everyone looking at him oh let's
[41:36.320 --> 41:41.160]  have two little boys at one the next two little girls with all these people looking at him
[41:41.160 --> 41:46.720]  going you're part of the cult and now the UN's lobbying and Nambler is a part of it the North
[41:46.720 --> 41:53.080]  American man boy love association their lobbying in universities and they had the major medical
[41:53.080 --> 41:58.160]  journals remember just came out the major psychology journal psychiatry to journal the
[41:58.160 --> 42:05.480]  national psychiatry journal pull it up psychiatry journal says pedophilia not a psychological
[42:05.480 --> 42:11.360]  disorder no it's a crime it's people praying on the innocent destroying their innocence
[42:11.360 --> 42:15.360]  destroying their development wrecking them so they don't have innocence and don't have
[42:15.360 --> 42:21.960]  free will I mean it's disgusting oh saying you like a woman to look beautiful that's anti
[42:21.960 --> 42:29.120]  feminist but if you want to sexualize a five-year-old that's just fine it's all this fake moral
[42:29.120 --> 42:36.840]  high ground garbage manly men are bad womanly alluring women are bad but let's teach first
[42:36.840 --> 42:42.280]  graders how to masturbate this happened in the US still ongoing in Europe where they
[42:42.280 --> 42:45.760]  have the little kindergarten in first grade time where you take a 30 minute nap after
[42:45.760 --> 42:50.320]  lunch I remember doing that and let me tell you they didn't have the teacher teach you
[42:50.320 --> 42:54.160]  how to play with yourself and I don't talk about stuff like this because I'm not hung
[42:54.160 --> 42:59.680]  up on sex folks these people are perverts and are hung up on sex and I'll tell you most
[42:59.680 --> 43:03.960]  of these so-called liberals come from highly religious families that use it as a tool
[43:03.960 --> 43:10.240]  of control to traumatize them and so now they are perverts ladies and gentlemen who are completely
[43:10.240 --> 43:15.280]  uncomfortable in their bodies and literally get off on doing the nastiest stuff they can
[43:15.280 --> 43:23.480]  the most unhealthy lifestyles they can gift givers gift receivers bug chasers men trying
[43:23.480 --> 43:27.760]  to give each other HIV and trying to give it to others and trying to give blood so
[43:27.760 --> 43:32.920]  they can give the gift and people criticize giving the gift and they're homophobic because
[43:32.920 --> 43:38.800]  they're saying don't go out and kill yourself and kill others what well then I am homophobic
[43:38.800 --> 43:44.760]  if if homophobia means don't teach pedophilia if homophobia means don't go out and try to
[43:44.760 --> 43:52.160]  have 100 sex partners a week in unprotected sex then I am a homophobe ladies and gentlemen
[43:52.160 --> 44:00.400]  need to get that straight I am phobic of hepatitis I am phobic of HIV I am phobic of death the
[44:00.400 --> 44:04.960]  truth is I don't dislike these individuals that are out there caught in this and these
[44:04.960 --> 44:07.960]  destructive lifestyles that just get worse and worse statistically you know who the
[44:07.960 --> 44:14.360]  number one group is in this country who has the lowest life expectancy of any group it's
[44:14.360 --> 44:21.920]  gay men now can you show well adjusted people that are yeah but the point is statistically
[44:21.920 --> 44:28.760]  it's destructive and if you say that you lose your TV show and again I never talk about
[44:28.760 --> 44:42.440]  this stuff I'm forced to because of the fallout continual assault against civilization and
[44:42.440 --> 44:46.560]  again for people out there that are naturally like this or going back to ancient times it's
[44:46.560 --> 44:49.960]  not just the chemicals in the water and the food this stuff's always gone on it's always
[44:49.960 --> 44:54.960]  been in the military it's the obsession with it is what I don't like in the in the total
[44:54.960 --> 45:02.000]  assault of it it's like a fad that's been a fad for a hundred years and I'm sick of
[45:02.000 --> 45:08.840]  hearing about it man I am sick of it it's like I'm tired of a boyfriend and a girlfriend
[45:08.840 --> 45:16.160]  who will go stand in front of the windows of your office every day from the place next
[45:16.160 --> 45:20.960]  door and kiss in front of everyone and grab on each other I guarantee you they're not
[45:20.960 --> 45:25.440]  going home and actually doing anything I'm telling you they they want to do it in public
[45:25.440 --> 45:32.560]  as some weirdo display and I'm irritated by that I'm sick of it now if you're out at
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.840]  the beach in its sunset you see a couple out the end of a pier really kiss each other that
[45:36.840 --> 45:44.480]  is romantic and sexy and but it's the difference of just the fakeness and the plasticness of
[45:44.480 --> 45:49.840]  it and the artificiality and how it's being force fed man I don't want to be force fed
[45:49.840 --> 45:54.200]  anything and it's not because I hate people and I want to make that clear it's not that
[45:54.200 --> 45:59.200]  I'm politically correct and want to go I promise I'm not hateful be nice like me I don't care
[45:59.200 --> 46:05.760]  if you like me I'm all about reality and telling you what I really think I don't like the fact
[46:05.760 --> 46:11.240]  that I'm raising three children in a country bombarded with this stuff and that my children
[46:11.240 --> 46:15.800]  end up hearing my show my son's here today and shouldn't be thinking about this this
[46:15.800 --> 46:22.880]  is bull this is sick man you don't go over and ask people what insurance they've got
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.200]  or what religion they are you don't walk up to random people and ask them what their favorite
[46:27.200 --> 46:31.800]  dish is because it's not your business and it's weird you don't walk over to random people
[46:31.800 --> 46:34.560]  and ask what their blood type is you don't walk over to random people ask them what's
[46:34.560 --> 46:39.080]  money they got in the bank account and you sure don't go into kindergarteners and first
[46:39.080 --> 46:44.560]  graders and beat them over the head so teaching them how to do stuff I can't even say on the
[46:44.560 --> 46:53.440]  radio yeah there it is Wisconsin schools teach fourth graders about masturbation oh it's
[46:53.440 --> 46:58.240]  a lot where people go hey it's natural big deal get them over it it isn't the state's

[55:00.320 --> 55:05.880]  hits the street that's liberal and when obama drops bombs on libya it's liberal gotta learn
[55:05.880 --> 55:09.640]  how to be liberal folks i think you can rob a bank and shoot people and say you're liberal
[55:09.640 --> 55:14.160]  they might actually think blood on the grounds of red carpet for you i mean it's that sick
[55:14.160 --> 55:20.000]  with these freaks chris lee anthony isaia mateo we're going to all of you christen new
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.240]  york tell us how your take on the new red terror in america as they try to ban free
[55:25.240 --> 55:33.960]  speech it's already gone alex i mean uh the problem is that the people are so stupid in
[55:33.960 --> 55:40.280]  this country anymore because they go to work like sheep they get stuck in traffic an hour
[55:40.280 --> 55:46.600]  there an hour back they sit at a desk all day they come home they put on the news they
[55:46.600 --> 55:51.160]  listen to the wrong news their kids play video games yeah we don't communicate everyone is
[55:51.160 --> 55:57.320]  being programmed by the fake culture that's artificial how the uh metaller somebody came
[55:57.320 --> 56:03.640]  out with a uh an ipad holder that goes over the baby's bouncer's feet that's how that's
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.840]  how you're supposed to entertain your kids now is hand them a ipad oh no no and i go
[56:07.840 --> 56:11.640]  to a restaurant they've got one and a half two year olds all sitting there playing with
[56:11.640 --> 56:15.760]  it and the doctors all admit and studies it brain damages them doesn't matter though
[56:15.760 --> 56:22.440]  it's liberal well you know i will the reason my main call was about the duck dynasty thing
[56:22.440 --> 56:29.640]  i mean any this is how stupid that these corporations are they have a guy and a family who has bought
[56:29.640 --> 56:35.480]  so much money to their network and has bought these people are like superstars now and it
[56:35.480 --> 56:41.560]  still has not changed the way that they are but you get one womanized person to complain
[56:41.560 --> 56:46.760]  about what the guy said and he didn't even come out and blatantly say anything really
[56:46.760 --> 56:51.400]  bad listen listen they're not stupid i know it seems like that's a normal person they
[56:51.400 --> 56:56.120]  their number one mission is you don't have free speech do you understand their mission
[56:56.120 --> 57:02.160]  is you shut up you do what we say you don't criticize our agenda because once the precedent
[57:02.160 --> 57:09.760]  set on gays or on christmas they can ban anything they want by fiat do you understand absolutely
[57:09.760 --> 57:14.720]  um another thing i wanted to mention is my daughter she came home with homework the other
[57:14.720 --> 57:21.680]  day and i'm a very staunch oppositionist to common core but they gave her uh it was called
[57:21.680 --> 57:27.120]  an eLA and expanded learning assignment and they wanted her to describe a hero and role
[57:27.120 --> 57:36.800]  model and how they got that way and this gets to the subject was dustin beaver no i wrote
[57:36.800 --> 57:40.680]  a nice note to the teacher that my daughter's not going to be doing any reports on a role
[57:40.680 --> 57:45.280]  model of justin beaver and again this is what the military does they have these questionnaires
[57:45.280 --> 57:52.600]  they give you on computers that then flip all the intel and flip all the info uh over uh
[57:52.600 --> 57:58.600]  to where they ask all the questions and then they describe who a hero is absolutely it's
[57:58.600 --> 58:02.880]  total programming but hey that sounds like better than two plus two equals four but you
[58:02.880 --> 58:07.600]  don't think justin beabler uh total moron who looks like he's wearing a man's diaper
[58:07.600 --> 58:14.440]  uh i mean you don't think that justin beabler's a hero no i don't but the the issue is is
[58:14.440 --> 58:19.440]  that the american people are not going to change until something happens to them unfortunately
[58:19.440 --> 58:25.000]  and i i've been a long time listener to you and i'm a prison plan subscriber and my friend

[1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:19.000]  want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:30.320]  austin texas alex jones well in america if you say that you don't understand gay men
[1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:37.720]  you like women and give your take you know like saying i like chocolate ice cream not
[1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:42.040]  vanilla i mean you should have an opinion that is not allowed and you lose your number
[1:00:42.040 --> 1:00:46.520]  one tv show in the country that's a duck dynasty they've kicked one of the brothers out one
[1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:50.720]  of the most popular the patriarch as they call him and the answer is for the whole family
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:54.200]  to leave the stinkin show they already have tons of money from their products they don't
[1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:59.360]  need this and it would be a shot across the bow that would bring the system really to
[1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:04.440]  its knees doubling down against these people and that's what i'm calling for a boycott
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:11.240]  of a&e look i'm telling you these guys have the clout to go out and start their own hunting
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:15.960]  and fishing channel and they'll make ten times the money and say whatever they want and that's
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:19.200]  the beginning of the end that's what i've been saying for a decade that's what glenn
[1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:23.760]  beck adopted on record taking a lot of our ideas which i'm proud of i'm glad he's got
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:27.960]  more organization more money more talented in many ways and and that's what we're gonna
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:32.160]  do down the road this is the future what you're seeing here major trade publications point
[1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:38.000]  that out that's why they want to censor us but we've got to dominate and take over before
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:44.320]  they're able to do that let's go to antony in ohio antony thanks for calling in today
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:51.120]  okay excellent alexa privilege privilege talk to you yeah thank you very much i have three
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:56.360]  comments to make and i think they're three pretty powerful car sure make them so the
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:02.640]  number one thing is is that a political correctness has nothing to do about being polite it has
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:08.360]  everything to do with controlling the language okay the top philosopher of the 20th century
[1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:17.400]  um uh Ludwig Wittgenstein uh he basically if i could summarize his whole philosophy
[1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:23.240]  he said language is everything so it goes all the way back to 1917 communism you know
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:28.720]  trotsky lennon you go to um they had sure that's what george arwell i'm gonna let you
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:33.280]  go to your other two points george arwell it was all about ink shock they were in that
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:37.960]  system they were reducing the language down toward a certain point there would only be
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:43.760]  emotions the party could program because words then give meaning in the mind to where you
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:49.960]  can have complex ideas so they're two plus two equals five they are literally right out
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:56.880]  of 1984 that's communist hardcore reeducation camp brain damage to where to where they can
[1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:01.680]  hold two ideas simultaneously in their mind that are opposing each other they are literally
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:07.320]  frying their brains go ahead yeah exactly i mean it's basically they have a party line
[1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:11.360]  and the communists say hey here's the good guys in their words here's the bad guys in
[1:03:11.360 --> 1:03:16.120]  their words if you say one of the bad words you're going to lose your job you're going
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:20.280]  to lose your tv show don't say any of the bad words and that's all it comes down to
[1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:23.760]  and then once they get you to accept a few bad words that people think oh let's be nice
[1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:28.200]  let's not say that then they can move it on to say mommy and daddy's now a hateful word
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:34.560]  ban that and listen al gore is back out saying the north pole melted and he was right it's
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:40.200]  the thickest ever recorded in modern time al gore says it melted because he is following
[1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:45.800]  a party line go ahead um okay well i'll just go on to my second point so the second point
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:50.600]  is you know right in the bible where jesus says he says basically build your house on
[1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:56.200]  the rock or build your house on the sand and the fact is that a nuclear family of beautiful
[1:03:56.200 --> 1:04:02.600]  children love commitment i mean that is your house on the rock so if somebody throws rocks
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:07.080]  at your house uh they're not going to hurt your house but it's like these homosexuals
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:11.800]  they have a glass house they have a house of cards and they're scared to death of people
[1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:16.200]  throwing stones at their house and they think if we adopt what they're doing that will suddenly
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:22.440]  make it okay yeah exactly i mean uh the guy from duck dynastown he watched the show but
[1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:28.440]  i'm really upset about it um the comment he made he basically says i prefer a woman over
[1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:33.720]  a man a man's behind and that's basically two plus two equals four i mean that's common
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:39.560]  sense i mean come on it's like saying i prefer this hamburger place over that one it's actually
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:46.040]  kind of a statement like uh you know that's a little funny god bless you great point anything else
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:52.120]  uh well i just wanted to say that um yeah actually i did have one more big point stay there recap
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:58.200]  your first two finish your third when we come back with anthony the nacea bateo tim lee and others
[1:04:58.200 --> 1:05:04.360]  more terrorist music taking us out in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple
[1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:11.000]  foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  guess what else is in the halogen family floor i ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:22.920]  the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the
[1:05:22.920 --> 1:05:30.280]  good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq

[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:34.200]  leftist devil worship or socialist the guy last week went to shoot up the conservatives in the
[1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:40.120]  debate team that's came out but didn't get national attention no no no no let's not profile who's
[1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:47.240]  doing this let's blame everybody and take everyone's free speech and writes away while the globalists
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:51.640]  you'll kill a citizen shoot the wrong woman in the back at the house on a fake drug raid or
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:56.040]  do proctology exams on the side of the road looking for drugs the government shipped in to begin with
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:12:01.720]  oh that's just collateral damage just an accident let's not worry about that when they kill you it's
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:09.880]  an accident when they kill you it doesn't matter but when you say you know i i like women i just
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:15.480]  don't understand all this gay thing everywhere i don't know what's going on oh you're fired from
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:22.920]  your number one show and tv history on cable as in the case with duck dynasty patriarch phil
[1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:28.760]  robinson and and the answer here is for the whole family to quit and leave and all of us boycott
[1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:37.320]  these people and break their back or they win he's the most popular guy on the show it looks like
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:42.440]  i want to see the hobbit or something with the dwarfs those guys peter jackson should just go
[1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:48.840]  hire them oh now i'm being mean to hillbillies i'm being insensitive grow up the system wants
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:53.240]  everybody so afraid of hurting somebody's feelings we're all basically sitting here urinating on
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:59.080]  ourselves in a fetal position scared to death the answer to all this tyranny is more free speech
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:05.480]  the answer to restricting free speech is to double down and i'm going back to your calls
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:10.520]  anthony wanted to finish up the three points he was making a gea matthew timley i'm gonna get to
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:15.080]  all the other guesses popping in then back to the calls but this is social engineering they
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:19.880]  want to end the family have the state be the family social engineering that's the official plan
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:25.320]  and now they're announcing banning homeschooling arresting homeschooling parents the legislation
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:31.880]  they're they're going on the news saying your kids aren't yours they're doing it it's happening
[1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:41.240]  it isn't coming it's here and we have to resist it and say no and stop laying down to it we have
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:47.240]  to get aggressive americans have been free freer than many other nations because we were ruthlessly
[1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:56.600]  independent ruthlessly individuals who were rugged and would rather die than submit to tyranny
[1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:06.040]  you know they even have like encyclopedias on texas history and they've got county encyclopedias
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:10.440]  and i'm not bragging in fact i haven't read them all but it's like reading an old western novel
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:15.560]  a louis lemore or something with just all these sides of my family and the stuff they did and
[1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:19.960]  how nice they were and how serious they were and then if somebody cheated them or didn't
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:25.240]  them they just killed them i mean it was just like it was just and that was just automatic
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:30.440]  it was like you cross us you're dead and that's why this country was so much freer because people
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:37.480]  didn't play games ladies and gentlemen i mean you didn't smart off to somebody because you were
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:42.440]  going to fight to the death of you did as a course of honor and i look at what we do today
[1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:47.720]  how we grovel i look at crowds of people how scared they are now and how timid and how insecure
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:51.240]  because they've never really lived they just watch television their whole life they live in
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:59.080]  glowing rooms watching other people in fake scripts engineering and data loading baloney
[1:14:59.080 --> 1:15:04.760]  into their minds and i watch smart people i know at a conscious level they're totally captured by
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:10.600]  fads and whatever's being pushed and they are literally in the matrix let's go to your calls
[1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:16.360]  anthony go ahead and make your three points okay alex so my third point is people need to
[1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:20.520]  realize there's a difference i think the whole zeitgeist of our time because there's a big
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:28.120]  difference between the packaging and the substance so for example in 2008 the mortgages the packaging
[1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:35.000]  oh they're triple a the substance they're toxic you see it in the store all the time what's the
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:42.040]  packaging on coke cans for example oh the zero calories it's great the substance has pertain
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:47.960]  you know poison um but then with a homosexuality it's the same thing what's the packaging that
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:56.280]  they wrap it up in rainbows gay which used to mean happy what's the substance well the cdc statistics
[1:15:56.280 --> 1:16:04.760]  the top three risk groups for hiv aid in america the number one risk group um homosexual white men
[1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:11.560]  the number two risk group homosexual black men the number three risk group homosexual
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:19.320]  Hispanic men i mean it's just a fact it's a statistic you know you're absolutely right and
[1:16:19.320 --> 1:16:24.360]  you made your two earlier points and again if we state facts were attacked and it's not that we
[1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:31.160]  hate anybody i'm sick of being bombarded with this 24 7 in open social engineering and the
[1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:38.200]  globalists don't care about gay people they put hiv out in hepatitis vaccines uh in the 1970s in
[1:16:38.200 --> 1:16:43.960]  new york that's been partially declassified that's a group they target look at the prisons getting
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:48.120]  the blood supply from those folks and then putting it in the hemophiliac medicine with
[1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:58.600]  Bayer pharmaceuticals this is a cold-blooded anti-human agenda and it's really scary it really is
[1:16:58.600 --> 1:17:04.200]  scary let's go ahead now and look through this folks they don't want babies they don't want you
[1:17:04.200 --> 1:17:11.400]  born they want you dead and that's what this is all about let's go ahead and go to another caller

[1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:18.200]  saw a living like that so that we don't think about the future or families it's a it's a psychological
[1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:23.800]  takeover and that is an indictment of individuals it's it's a fact that it we're being force fed
[1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:28.280]  this and people that are in it feel like they're part of a winning team but statistically they're

[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:30.040]  with the uh indefinite suspension of the main duck dynasty star because he dare say that uh you know
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:36.920]  he likes women that's the ultimate thought crime also kho u 11 reports on this mystery disease
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:40.760]  i won't open the phones up later specifically we know about all the weird deaths from this
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:45.400]  respiratory thing but it's not flu and they can't identify what it is it killed my cousin
[1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:51.640]  and my uncle's been in the hospital for several weeks uh over this and they cannot identify what
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:56.680]  it is i told i called it a mystery illness weeks ago telling people all over the country but really
[1:24:56.680 --> 1:25:04.920]  bad in texas uh so that's up on info wars dot com now i wanted to get him on because there's a lot
[1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:09.400]  of charities out there i like the salvation army most of the money you give them actually in the
[1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:14.200]  studies over 90 percent actually goes to poor people and helps people uh but i see all these
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:18.280]  veterans groups and a lot of it's turned out to be fraud you've seen in the news or a third of the
[1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:23.160]  money goes or bill clinton's charity for haiti half the money goes for it's just his jet aircraft
[1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:29.480]  fleet he just paid for bill clinton the jet set around the world i mean it's truly evil uh and
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:35.160]  but what i really like is when you have groups that are you know farmer owned down in southern
[1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:39.800]  mexico where you know almost all the money to buy the beans say with the coffee we put out
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:45.480]  wake of america blend from southern mexico my favorite type of coffee bean folks are
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:50.920]  concurring with it by the way it's really amazing coffee that way you're actually going right to
[1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:57.080]  people and in building an economy not just in the u.s but in north america as well i want to
[1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:01.320]  build up mexico's economy and build them up and then build up america not just bring in poor people
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:05.160]  and collapse america but you see all these different veterans groups out there collecting
[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:12.280]  money and some are good some aren't but the idea of veterans getting together who in many cases
[1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:17.720]  can't get jobs are disabled in this bad economy and then producing high quality products is the
[1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:22.840]  way to go just like supporting real media libertarian media patriot media free media
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:28.200]  is the way we have the alternative media take over and become the dominant media
[1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:33.000]  which is now happening show a paul jinkens joins us he's the chief executive officer
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:38.440]  a veteran beer company dot com i haven't tried the beer yet i've been cutting back for weight
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:42.520]  reasons but i'm i'm sure it's going to be great i'm going to get some ship to me he's a disabled
[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:48.680]  navy veteran paul left the military for 14 years uh and uh to accept the position of director for
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:53.640]  police department upon leaving public service he moved into private enterprise and he joins us
[1:26:53.640 --> 1:26:58.600]  now he's been working in the aerospace industry you name it international crisis resolution he
[1:26:58.600 --> 1:27:04.600]  currently leads um bandcroft architects and engineers a disabled veteran owned small business
[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:09.160]  that employs disabled veterans in each of its six offices across the country paul's undergraduate

[1:27:13.320 --> 1:27:18.600]  university of chicago so he's that's a great school there at the university of chicago
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:22.200]  belt and treatment the whole nine yards veteran beer company dot com we got a few minutes for
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:25.800]  a break we'll come back and really get into it after the break but paul thanks for coming on
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:30.040]  in a nutshell tell us about the beer company uh you're launching because i see this is
[1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:35.560]  revolutionary well thank you very much for having me it's uh it's something that i think is meaningful
[1:27:35.560 --> 1:27:41.240]  and it was important there's a crisis in veteran unemployment in america and what we decided to
[1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:46.440]  do was uh rather than sit around and wait for someone else to handle our problems we figured
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:51.160]  we would just handle them ourselves and that's really the uh the the whole concept behind the
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:56.840]  company and it's called premium american lager it has the v for victory from world war two and
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:01.880]  red white and blue i like it thank you sir yeah it's uh everything you see the packaging all
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:07.080]  designed by veterans uh the graphic art uh the beer is brewed by veterans every employee in the
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:13.000]  company is a veteran and always will be owned by veterans always will be uh the bylaws are written
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:19.960]  that way um and uh and it's our objective to be america uh uh largest selling beer oh you got
[1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:25.800]  blonde bomber that looks really delicious yes sir that's uh that's the blonde ale november 11th
[1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:31.800]  we went to market with two beers in indiana and illinois the lager that's called the veteran and
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:36.680]  and the blonde bomber which is a blonde ale and uh they've just been getting rave reviews everywhere
[1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:44.600]  in part because our brewer uh a u.s military veteran marine corps disabled uh is uh is is just
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:53.080]  one of the most credential brewers you can ever ask to find so it's a premium lager tell me about
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:58.600]  its taste yeah you know the the lager itself has got this rich caramel color five percent alcohol
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:03.160]  by volume so it's an easy drinking beer that you can have um uh while you're watching a game or
[1:29:03.160 --> 1:29:10.520]  sporting event uh a concert it's uh it's light on the tongue the carbonation is a little sharper
[1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:16.360]  than uh the mainstream beers eric ryan our brewer has used only premium ingredients he's hand
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:21.960]  selected everything that goes in there's no filler there's no adjunct there's nothing cheap about this
[1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:27.480]  beer and uh the reason that uh that we've introduced it in the way that we have is so that people can
[1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:32.440]  can immediately recognize the the quality and we're going to keep driving the price of that beer
[1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:38.280]  down well it's exciting i mean you know instead of uh giving a man fish teach him how to fish
[1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:43.160]  we need to see more of this veteran companies veteran run veteran owned we're going to be right
[1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:48.280]  back to talk to paul jinkens more about this amazing idea he had it's already a big success
[1:29:48.280 --> 1:29:56.280]  yes we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:37.720]  not be any christmas in christmas other than learning to be a good socialist and worshiping
[1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:43.720]  world government and worshiping common core two plus two equals five on the night before christmas
[1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:47.480]  paul jinkens is our guest from other six seven minutes then i'm going to get back into the
[1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:54.280]  latest breaking news and your phone calls toll free number to join us 800 259 92 31 and folks
[1:33:54.280 --> 1:34:00.600]  i didn't just get this fellow on because uh you know it's for veterans or paying lip service to it
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:08.200]  the real way to help veterans because everybody pays them lip service is to go out to veteran-owned
[1:34:08.200 --> 1:34:12.440]  type companies and support them if they have high quality products and this looks like
[1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:16.600]  high quality products to me and all the veterans i've hired have turned out to be my best hard
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:21.320]  working crew members that are dedicated to focus i've just found that and so i don't want to say
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:25.320]  we have a preference towards veterans but they certainly end up going to the top of the list
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:30.600]  and being our best crew members here at the info wars dot com operation so paul let me give you
[1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:35.240]  the floor to break down the company and what you've done but this is revolutionary just for
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:42.680]  made in america we've come out with our made in 1776 dot com brand of totally made america clothing
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:49.320]  this is how we can take america back is buying america and then also buying from pro liberty
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:55.800]  organizations and pro veteran organizations and if people just start doing this we'll rebuild our
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:35:02.680]  country very very quickly alex you're right you know um those things you talk about on a daily
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:09.400]  basis really resonated with us um it's it's so important to to do the right thing and not just
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:16.440]  what feels good um it's easy to stand up and cheer when you see the veteran on the jumbo tron
[1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:22.440]  it's much harder to say where does that veteran fit into my organization it's it's easy to make a
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:28.280]  donation to an organization that might have good intentions but but listen make a wish
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:31.960]  for people who are going to die not for veterans who are going to be living in america for the
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:38.440]  next 40 or 50 years looking for work and so what we're we're doing is we're providing not jobs
[1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:44.520]  we're providing careers and and what we're trying to do is uh but you know of course exclusively
[1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:49.800]  in-house every employee will be a veteran but but our supplier partners wherever possible we're
[1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:54.680]  doing just what you say we are uh we are using veteran owned small businesses to provide our
[1:35:54.680 --> 1:36:01.080]  paper products our printing products we are using uh suppliers who commit to us that they will hire
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:07.880]  veteran and every fill that they've got after they sign contracts with with us and and again so at
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:12.920]  the end of the day it's not about making a standing ovation or a small donation somewhere
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:17.480]  it's about you know taking care of people who volunteered to defend the rights and the freedoms
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:23.320]  that we've all enjoyed well i'm going to get a 12 pack uh for christmas hopefully i can still get
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:30.280]  it in time and a toast to you guys and i got a significant suspicion uh if the beer tastes as
[1:36:30.280 --> 1:36:35.640]  good as the bottling and packaging looks i got to say that's about the sexiest beer packaging
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:43.080]  i've ever seen uh i mean that and that is a good-looking package so i hope the package uh the contents
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:48.440]  match the package i promise you they do and uh and you know people have talked about the back story
[1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:52.840]  to the beer the fact that we're all veterans and most of us are disabled veterans at this point
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:58.280]  in the company the beer is way better than the packaging even and and the back story the packaging
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:03.960]  is popular and and that's we've been selling out of a lot of our products you know t-shirts and
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:10.120]  sweatshirts and things and i'll make sure you get you get beer and i i'll go ahead and make a gentleman's
[1:37:10.120 --> 1:37:15.640]  agreement with you bet with you sir it'll be your favorite beer well i can't wait to try it out because
[1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:22.680]  again we need to bring america back across the board from art to industry to to food products
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:27.640]  across the board and i mean this is something i really have seen success with and of course the
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:32.840]  entire bi-american campaign other points you'd like to make sir in closing uh about uh the new
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:37.880]  venture that's already been such a success uh yes sir you know we're we're so proud of the people
[1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:42.600]  and that's that's what it is we've tried to build the company in a way that we would like to see
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:48.760]  the country be built uh based on some of the military principles uh we give 10 we are a
[1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:55.000]  for-profit entity but but we're a b-corp so we we are committed to the mission over our profits
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:00.520]  and the mission is to employ and give careers to veterans 10 of net goes to veterans supported
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:07.160]  charities and uh and then i also i i wrote the company bylaws so that we have term limits uh
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:11.800]  everyone in the company has 10 years either to move up be promoted within the company
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:17.800]  or move out and uh so i started i found it and i funded a company that i'm going to turn over to
[1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:25.480]  the next generation in less than 10 years very exciting paul jinkens and of course uh you can

[1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:47.000]  is only slashing benefits to the people not corporate welfare so that's the plan and speaking

[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:54.680]  those are the folks that lobby to raise your taxes every single day speaking of police
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:42:01.400]  state news i want to get to a report we're in georgetown ohio i saw a case out of georgetown
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:09.480]  ohio probably about 15 years ago that was about 1998 where a guy was walking through a walmart
[1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:13.000]  parking lot i remember correctly because it was a clipping out of the associated press i got a
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.760]  local paper here in austin had the story they thought it was good though they were agreeing with
[1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:21.960]  it in there basically it was written dryly and a police dog the window was rolled down
[1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:27.320]  and the dog stuck its head out and almost bit the guy growling and stamping and the guy said
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:32.760]  shut up dog which is what you're supposed to do i had uh some guy with two pit bulls on the green
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:37.960]  belt a few weeks ago come right up growling and i went get back dog get back and the guy kind of
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:41.400]  got mad i'm like what am i supposed to do then the next group of people yelled get back dog
[1:42:42.200 --> 1:42:45.880]  and then of course i ran into the same woman that's been down there before with her five german
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:49.960]  shepherds and they came over and started growling at some guy and he yelled at them and she got mad
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:55.800]  again not at me it's just like all right i'll just roll over show my neck to the dog but it's that
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:43:02.840]  same place where they arrested him for verbally assaulting an officer even though the statue
[1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:09.000]  didn't say that and threw him in jail for yelling back at the god uh and speaking of uh georgetown
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:15.880]  ohio brown county coroner says a key piece of video evidence taken moments before an inmate's
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:22.520]  death was deleted by the county jail the missing video is one of three pieces of jail surveillance
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:27.880]  that show zachary goldson during the last 30 minutes of his life 24 year old was found hanging
[1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:34.120]  by a bed sheet in the adult attention center october 5th nine days after his arrest and it goes on
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:38.360]  though they were able to find other videos the video was captured by two motion activated cameras
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.920]  the jail we have video of that you can roll that in the background if you like which gave a view
[1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:47.160]  from the hallway outside of his cell is missing deleted by the sheriff's office
[1:43:49.960 --> 1:43:57.080]  but now they've been able to find some of the other uh security uh and a dashcam video and a
[1:43:57.080 --> 1:44:06.840]  lot more we have several videos uh showing this type of thing go on now moving on uh here folks uh to
[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:18.760]  uh some of the other articles that we have here uh we have lawsuit woman based illegal body cavity
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:25.240]  search observed bowel movement and that's what the case we saw last week where they did eight
[1:44:25.880 --> 1:44:31.880]  probes of the of this man in the hospital and of course didn't find any of the drugs and my
[1:44:31.880 --> 1:44:41.960]  issue is the majority of the drugs the majority of the drugs are being shipped in by the big banks
[1:44:41.960 --> 1:44:46.280]  and laundering it and they keep it illegal to keep the price up and then to create a drug culture
[1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:50.600]  where it's all we've got running in our economy now and then the criminals run prostitutes and
[1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:56.200]  break in your house and run rackets and it's just organized crime at the end of the prohibition with
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:02.120]  alcohol was illegal needed something else to do so they got lost pass to make drugs illegal and they
[1:45:02.120 --> 1:45:07.000]  use the pta and christian groups to help lobby for it before that you could buy cocaine heroin
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:12.360]  opium at the local store and uh you could do whatever you wanted to and there was much less
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:18.440]  drug use and it was dirt cheap so this is the type of stuff that's going on in our society
[1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:26.040]  let's go to lee in canada lee you're on the air thanks for holding i guess you want to call
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:33.240]  about duc dynasty being censored for not serving uh political correctness hey alex uh yeah no

[1:45:40.440 --> 1:45:46.360]  their breaking on it they have uh they're totally brought out song record it was all false it was
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:53.400]  all live you can't trust anything that come from these mainstream uh tv channels um i'm actually
[1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:59.720]  like you touched on this earlier i'm actually uh about global warming in algore again i'm
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:05.400]  a hundred kilometers south from where you can actually go see polar bears and i'm telling you
[1:46:05.400 --> 1:46:12.280]  man like this year december has been record days almost every day i think two of the last 30 days
[1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:14.760]  have have not been records
[1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:24.360]  well al gore says that the earth is uh burning up and that the ice caps melted so why don't

[1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:35.960]  time for him but the other thing is i think that uh like with the whole set homosexual comment
[1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:40.920]  and everything like that but you know they're doing a really good job of getting to the women up here

[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:07.240]  80 plus percent of advertising is targeting women and women statistically but it's not by much
[1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:12.920]  because men are buying into it as well absolutely by whatever the culture says and that's because
[1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:19.640]  genetic studies show women are conformist uh and they tend to conform for tribal good like
[1:47:19.640 --> 1:47:25.000]  there's a good chief running things uh but it's not a good chief it's a chief that wants them

[1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:13.960]  when i was signing stuff because i was signing stuff even while the movie was on i guess he
[1:55:13.960 --> 1:55:18.040]  came out to the bathroom and saw me walking on the hall at the elbow draft house and then at the
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:23.160]  end when he came out i'd written a note and it said like against the wind deadlines and commitments

[2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:41.160]  since 2008 and i know you don't like to hear it but thank you no no i like to hear it brother i just
[2:00:41.160 --> 2:00:45.720]  you know i'm just not perfect i have a lot of guilt over things in my life i mean i'm not a bad guy
[2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:49.240]  but you know it's just it's just weird to have everybody thinking you're a great guy you know
[2:00:49.240 --> 2:00:54.840]  well you know i feel almost like i know you i've been listening to you for i haven't missed a show
[2:00:54.840 --> 2:01:04.120]  i don't think for five years um my roots my family roots go back to 1624 wow anyway there are two
[2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:13.000]  things that i want to talk about uh one of them is this mystery illness uh fox news uh just a few
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:20.360]  minutes ago well an hour ago now 12 03 p.m uh announced that they had in conro those four deaths
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:30.840]  were h1n1 pig flu well we sure sure well we caught them years ago lying about deaths from other
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:36.360]  stuff saying it was h1n1 swine flu and then we know that that vaccine was actually spreading it that
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:41.080]  actually came out folks look it up uh but that's interesting because i have family that's died
[2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:45.240]  from this and my uncle's been tested and they said it was not flu and they're having deaths in that
[2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:52.200]  hospital uh in tyler uh it's a really nice hospital there and they're saying it's not flu
[2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:58.760]  so very interesting national fox news reported that i don't know if it's national or not it's
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:02:07.320]  fox 26 here in houston um the uh no it was a local it was a local reporter uh i believe anyway um
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:13.560]  um uh they were saying that the the short test or the easy test or whatever it didn't show up they
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:20.200]  didn't think it was that and then that they got some more extensive test or whatever and uh
[2:02:21.240 --> 2:02:25.960]  have to have determined that it's h1n1 i don't know if that's true what they're saying is the
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:32.280]  houston chronicle and i've got it's reporting mystery illness likely h1n1 so see but i mean
[2:02:32.280 --> 2:02:37.240]  i'm dealing with the doctors myself my dad's been there at the hospital for days off and on
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:42.680]  and he was just there yesterday in east texas he drove back last night with my mom uh because it and
[2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:48.920]  it's uh they're saying it's not h1n1 and let me tell you usually when they're hyping the flu it's
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:53.480]  not really bad and it's people that are really sick to get killed by it they haven't been hyping
[2:02:53.480 --> 2:03:00.840]  this which is unusual this stuff is deadly this stuff is deadly because listen here's the deal
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:05.640]  flu you usually get better from it in three or four days or it kills you people are sick for a
[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:11.160]  month with this stuff does that sound like any flu you ever heard of right i just got my wife
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:20.840]  out of the hospital on the uh uh 14th of last month no that yeah four no the four yeah the four
[2:03:21.480 --> 2:03:26.520]  14th of last month and she's still not a hundred percent oh so she's got the same lung stuff
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:34.040]  i yeah it's and it it was attacking her organs it was attacking uh her uh kidneys i was about
[2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:39.000]  to say my uncle's got kidney stuff now yeah this is incredible this is some weaponized stuff it's
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:47.240]  not flu uh we've had our children tested here who had it not flu uncle tested not flu they didn't

[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:58.200]  to be here Alex thanks for having me so much to talk about what do you want to begin with uh we
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:01.880]  could spend three hours talking couldn't we yeah there's a lot of stuff why don't we talk about
[2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:07.240]  bitcoin actually because i find it rather fascinating especially the debate that's going on
[2:10:07.240 --> 2:10:12.840]  within uh libertarian and austrian economic circles right now sure give us your take on it
[2:10:12.840 --> 2:10:17.880]  well first of all i think like everybody else i like to see the development of something like
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:23.000]  bitcoin i really like the idea of competing currencies uh and i think the people behind
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:27.480]  bitcoin of course have the best of intentions and lots of people that are getting into bitcoin
[2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:32.200]  are getting into it for the right reasons it's not the dollar it's not the euro it's not the end
[2:10:32.200 --> 2:10:37.080]  you know it's not a government issued fiat currency nevertheless i have some problems with bitcoin
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:42.840]  myself that other people in the hard money camp have first of all money comes to the market emerges
[2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:48.040]  on the market it isn't like someone just says hey this is money let's start using it and i think
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:53.880]  that the reason that people are going into bitcoin is exactly because of what it isn't it's not the
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:58.040]  dollars not the euro it's not the end whereas if we look at something like precious metals the gold
[2:10:58.040 --> 2:11:03.160]  and silver yeah we can argue they don't have intrinsic value from a theoretical economic
[2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:08.200]  perspective and that's true nevertheless they have a six thousand year history of being money
[2:11:08.200 --> 2:11:14.280]  of being desired for people of being desired by people people want the precious metals because
[2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:21.560]  of what they are and i really feel that bitcoin is sort of taking a lot of the interest that would
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:27.000]  be in the metals and and diverting it like i said that's great in the idea that it's it's a competing
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:32.760]  currency but nevertheless i don't think it's the competing currency that does have the ability to
[2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:40.200]  break the state's monopoly on the issuance of money very well said plus they can use uh the
[2:11:40.200 --> 2:11:46.280]  unknown providence of this they can use the takedown of bitcoin to then demonize and taint the idea
[2:11:46.280 --> 2:11:52.280]  of true independent cryptocurrencies that's all i'm saying is this may not have a happy ending
[2:11:52.280 --> 2:11:57.800]  and i'm not in some cult uh just saying it's perfect we've got about down to it we've got to
[2:11:57.800 --> 2:12:03.000]  have some concerns investing in anything uh especially something brand new and speculative is
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:07.880]  dangerous and you hit the nail on the head right there alex there that is the problem
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:14.440]  with bitcoin from a more macro level if we're introducing the idea of competing currencies
[2:12:14.440 --> 2:12:19.320]  and then one of these competing currencies ends up in a bubble ends up with a lot of people putting
[2:12:19.320 --> 2:12:23.800]  a lot of money into it like i heard recently that you know folks are saying that bitcoin could go to
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:28.680]  a hundred thousand dollars a coin or even a million dollars a coin people are going to start getting
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:32.600]  into this thing because wow it's starting to shoot up in value i need to get into it before
[2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:38.600]  the train leaves the station and then all of a sudden the thing crashes then the status are
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:43.400]  going to say see we told you money is way too important for the market to handle only the
[2:12:43.400 --> 2:12:49.000]  governments should be handling money and it will it will uh as you say demonize the entire idea of
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:56.200]  competing currencies now shifting gears out of that let's look at the tsa because your comments
[2:12:56.200 --> 2:13:01.480]  made national news and i think more people should speak up this is our country the tsa's own internal
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:06.280]  documents that came out a few months ago admit they've never stopped a real terrorist now they're
[2:13:06.280 --> 2:13:10.840]  running checkpoints on the highways and are becoming a federal police force what's your
[2:13:10.840 --> 2:13:17.880]  personal take on it and what have been your experiences well the tsa as an organization as
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:22.760]  an agency is in standing violation of fourth amendment to united states constitution which
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:28.200]  says that we should be free to go as we please there should not be unreasonable searches and
[2:13:28.200 --> 2:13:32.680]  seizures without due process of law without a warrant being issued showing up in an airport
[2:13:32.680 --> 2:13:38.840]  to get on a commercial airplane is not probable cause and what the tsa does despite the fact that
[2:13:38.840 --> 2:13:45.080]  again you look at tsa agents as individuals and many of them of course are are very decent decent
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:50.280]  people trying to do a good job trying to do what they think is right nevertheless the organization
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:57.400]  itself is a means by which you know the the government is basically getting into our business
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:03.960]  when it doesn't belong there the only contact that we should have with federal authorities
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:10.440]  is when we are in the process of committing a crime or we are thought to be about to commit a crime
[2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:16.920]  and that's about it and this idea that they should be questioning us that of course with like the
[2:14:16.920 --> 2:14:21.960]  nsa that they should be listening to everything that we do that everything goes into a federal
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:28.280]  database that they should just be in our business in general as they are is very dangerous to freedom
[2:14:28.280 --> 2:14:35.000]  and unfortunately it is indicative of the fact that many americans have traded their liberty for
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:40.840]  security and we were warned against doing that by the founding fathers sure and again if you just
[2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:45.800]  joined us glenn jake has known as kane one of the top wrestlers in the world is here and he is
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:53.400]  talking about being free and it's so asinine to claim that uh government can keep us safe
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:57.400]  and and we knew that they would start moving out of the airports on the roads and into the malls
[2:14:57.400 --> 2:15:03.800]  and the sport stadiums the idea that the feds have to be everywhere where a bad person might try
[2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:09.000]  to hurt you while they try to keep the individual from being armed to protect ourselves that is
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:14.920]  obviously the real answer to terrorism or crime uh it's just a transparent power grab what is your
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:23.560]  view of the the dictatorial move of obama particularly uh and uh on so many issues bypassing
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:30.360]  the constitution and in your gut what historic point do you think we're at are we near the
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:35.000]  tipping point is there an awakening uh what does your gut tell you because you come off as a really
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:41.320]  informed well researched smart guy i think we are close to a tipping point i mean of course we can't
[2:15:41.320 --> 2:15:46.200]  predict economics and a lot of us thought in 2007 2008 that was really the beginning at the end
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:52.760]  right uh but the world economy is very complex and there are all sorts of different dynamics at play
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:57.080]  so we don't know how long things can go on economically they could go on for a few years
[2:15:57.080 --> 2:16:01.720]  they could go on for a few months we have no idea and there's probably equal chance of either
[2:16:01.720 --> 2:16:07.320]  i do believe that we are at a tipping point though uh because i there's an undercurrent that people
[2:16:07.320 --> 2:16:12.520]  are just tired of all this you know freedom and liberty means being able to live your life as you
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:18.840]  want to live it so long as you're not hurting anybody else what is wrong with that i that's
[2:16:18.840 --> 2:16:24.760]  that's what i don't understand about people that disagree with libertarian philosophy how in the
[2:16:24.760 --> 2:16:29.480]  world did you say that people should not be able to live their life as they wish if they're not hurting
[2:16:29.480 --> 2:16:35.320]  you and that's for everybody around the world i think that's what everybody wants and we've seen
[2:16:35.320 --> 2:16:39.800]  more and more by the especially the federal government moving in areas that they've never
[2:16:39.800 --> 2:16:46.760]  been in before moving there very vigorously and uh yeah so i think we are at a tipping point
[2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:52.680]  i think our job is to educate as many people as possible because i don't i don't think that there
[2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:56.280]  is any way to stop what's going to happen i have you see that we're going to have i think that we're
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:17:04.120]  going to have horrendous economic times coming up the bright spot and all that is yes that will
[2:17:04.120 --> 2:17:09.320]  allow for a paradigm change so we have to educate people before we get there to understand what the
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:15.000]  real problems were what caused the problems and how we solve the problems on the other side and in
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:19.960]  the end i think that once we get through this crisis we will see a golden age of liberty and
[2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:24.280]  freedom i i really do believe i agree glenn jacobus is our guest what what freaks me out is when i
[2:17:24.280 --> 2:17:30.120]  read globalist white papers that we've uh displayed here on the air they admit all of this and their
[2:17:30.120 --> 2:17:34.680]  collectivist model is going to fail but they still believe they should be in control as kind of the
[2:17:34.680 --> 2:17:40.520]  brain bugs on top of the little hive ants or bees as they see us and they want to bring in a total
[2:17:40.520 --> 2:17:46.520]  state and this computer system that they believe will finally make collectivism work as they say it
[2:17:46.520 --> 2:17:53.160]  but really we've just been usurped and conquered by people using fraud and criminal criminal
[2:17:53.160 --> 2:17:59.640]  philosophies that aren't really based in reality and when i see all over the country bills introduced
[2:17:59.640 --> 2:18:05.640]  and moves to ban homeschooling and when i see the persecution of gun owners and the persecution of
[2:18:05.640 --> 2:18:12.440]  free speech i just hope we can hold off a violent revolution so that we can just restore our republic
[2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:18.520]  somehow peacefully what does what does the cane in you think about all this i guess cane would be a
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:27.320]  fan of tyranny uh yeah he probably would be luckily and luckily i'm hot and yeah you know but violent
[2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:32.120]  revolution of course is not the answer and that will only bring you more problems as we've seen
[2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:35.960]  as we've seen throughout history when when there have been violent violent revolutions we have to
[2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:42.120]  look at what comes next and often what replaces what what the current paradigm is something far
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:46.680]  worse so i really do believe that education is the key getting people to understand the problems
[2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:50.120]  getting people to understand what caused the problems and getting people to understand how
[2:18:50.120 --> 2:18:55.640]  we solve the problems and solving the problems is does not mean giving big government more power
[2:18:55.640 --> 2:18:59.800]  means giving big government less power downsizing the government as much as we possibly can
[2:18:59.800 --> 2:19:09.160]  you have absolutely just born in on the heart of it revolutions don't ever work except in the
[2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:14.680]  case of 1776 you can count on one hand revolutions that make things better usually it's a french
[2:19:14.680 --> 2:19:21.160]  revolution and go from bad to worse because the fundamental cultural rot is still there our revolution
[2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:27.640]  was successful because it was so so fundamentally pro-liberty that even though it was never attained
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:33.080]  fully it was the idea of reaching out in an evolution towards greater and greater freedom
[2:19:33.080 --> 2:19:39.080]  greater and greater empowerment that historically uplifts people free association where those that
[2:19:39.080 --> 2:19:45.160]  rise are those that have better ideas or more honorable instead of the king rat big government
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:52.360]  model so we need to have a restoration and a cultural velvet revolution against their tyranny
[2:19:52.360 --> 2:19:58.600]  that is the system that is unstoppable ron paul says that an idea whose time has come
[2:19:58.600 --> 2:20:03.480]  can't be stopped an army can't stop it's more powerful than an army once you're able to change
[2:20:03.480 --> 2:20:09.080]  hearts and minds you're able to do tremendous things and that's one thing i found in my own life
[2:20:09.080 --> 2:20:14.440]  you know i may not be able to control everything that goes out on the rest of world what i can
[2:20:14.440 --> 2:20:20.520]  control is how i think about things educating myself trying to enlighten other people or at
[2:20:20.520 --> 2:20:23.880]  least give them the ability to think about things differently at least give them a different
[2:20:23.880 --> 2:20:30.520]  perspective and that has made tremendous differences in my own life and i think for the population
[2:20:30.520 --> 2:20:38.120]  at large that is the key is to at least expose people to a different paradigm to show them
[2:20:38.120 --> 2:20:43.240]  that there is a red pill and what we can and can take it but nevertheless we can at least
[2:20:44.440 --> 2:20:47.880]  show them that the thing exists and that's a step in the right direction
[2:20:47.880 --> 2:20:53.160]  exactly ron paul as you know he was on us a few days ago it points out that the key time is during
[2:20:53.160 --> 2:20:59.000]  the collapse the socialist and communist want to use cloward and piven to collapse things and then
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:05.320]  poses the saviors to get their vice grips into us that much tighter and and enslave us but if we
[2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:11.960]  point out their system failed not free market capitalism but that it's crony insider capitalism
[2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:18.280]  coupled with socialism that the robber barons are pushing it's game over for them they want to use
[2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:24.200]  class warfare when it's warren buffett the biggest recipient of banker bailout money lobbying to
[2:21:24.200 --> 2:21:30.520]  raise taxes on the middle class yeah alex i wrote an article for the daily caller and the title of
[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:35.800]  it this is why back the title of it was does the free market cause wealth inequality and it does not
[2:21:35.800 --> 2:21:38.680]  of course there are always going to be people that are going to be wealthier than other people
[2:21:38.680 --> 2:21:42.680]  because they have different better talents or they're smarter or they have better luck or
[2:21:42.680 --> 2:21:47.640]  they just play work hard but what causes wealth inequality is big government what has caused
[2:21:47.640 --> 2:21:53.000]  the explosion in the wealth gap that we've seen since the financial crisis in 2007 2008 is the
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:57.400]  fact that the federal reserve has pumped trillions of dollars out into the economy you and i haven't
[2:21:57.400 --> 2:22:00.920]  gotten it the middle class has not gotten it people on wall street have gotten it they've used
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:05.240]  that to buy assets at lower prices and then it's more and more people of course by the assets those
[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:11.400]  assets go up in price that's what causes wealth inequality the free market actually narrows the
[2:22:11.400 --> 2:22:15.640]  wealth gap because we get all produced in the way that we want so we can all become as big as we
[2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:23.240]  want to be and there's no debating that socialism fascism every form of collectivism creates living
[2:22:23.800 --> 2:22:31.160]  hell and it always does and i'm sick of the collectivist telling me oh british healthcare is great
[2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:35.880]  it's socialist when i got people that work for me that live in england i watch c span and see
[2:22:35.880 --> 2:22:42.200]  the parliamentary hearings it is a hellhole very good friend that grew up in canada he was told
[2:22:42.200 --> 2:22:47.000]  all through school that the canadian health system was the best best in the world of course until he
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:51.400]  needed to get an MRI and had to wait six months but he was able to cross the border he lived in
[2:22:51.400 --> 2:22:56.360]  toronto he's able to come to Detroit and get the MRI that day there's a problem there but yeah we a
[2:22:56.360 --> 2:23:01.800]  lot of folks around the world unfortunately have been propagandized to believe that socialism which
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:08.120]  is really many respects communism like it is the ultimate political arrangement of human beings
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:15.080]  it's not it does leave mass poverty and it leads to misery and there's no doubt about it it's just
[2:23:15.080 --> 2:23:20.680]  incredible al gore says the north pole the north pole melted it didn't al gore says socialism's great
[2:23:20.680 --> 2:23:26.200]  it's horrible these people know their liars and they've all gotten rich off of collectivizing
[2:23:26.200 --> 2:23:31.400]  the stuff that they basically control and skim off the top of now again we've only got about seven
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:35.160]  minutes left with you i hope you'll come on as things develop around the country i know you're
[2:23:35.160 --> 2:23:41.080]  helping organize libertarians to run for office and take our country back i've been asking the
[2:23:41.080 --> 2:23:47.640]  questions here give us your take on what you think's most important other news items that you think
[2:23:47.640 --> 2:23:53.880]  need to be discussed again there's you know there's so much stuff the federal reserve to me is the
[2:23:53.880 --> 2:23:59.800]  most important issue that we deal with it's 100 year anniversary's monday yeah yeah and jenny yell
[2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:03.400]  and of course is going it isn't as the new fed chairman the other day the fed just said that
[2:24:03.400 --> 2:24:08.200]  they're going to what taper about ten billion dollars a month they're still pumping seventy
[2:24:08.200 --> 2:24:13.080]  five billion dollars a month into the economy and if you look at their balance sheet it's more than
[2:24:13.080 --> 2:24:17.720]  that and the reason the fed is so important is because it empowers big government people don't
[2:24:17.720 --> 2:24:22.760]  like to pay taxes when taxes go up they tend not to vote for the people who are in office so the
[2:24:22.760 --> 2:24:27.320]  politicians in the central bank has figured out what to circumnavigate that will print the money
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:32.600]  that will buy the services that people expect expect from the government and then people pay
[2:24:32.600 --> 2:24:37.160]  for it through price inflation but of course because the price inflation comes later and
[2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:41.240]  because it's hidden because it's generally embedded in the price of products we can blame
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:46.920]  that on the market we can bring blame that on business people we can blame that on you know
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:53.240]  greedy oil companies or whatever so to me that's the most important issue is the fed reserve we
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:58.600]  can't talk about that enough we have to audit the fed reserve you know bernie sanders showed
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:04.040]  this guy's a socialist and he was able to come out and show that the fed lent out 17 trillion
[2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:11.400]  dollars in 2007 2008 you and i didn't get it who got it the people on wall street but we wouldn't
[2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:18.200]  even know about it if if he hadn't done that investigation because the fed had lax transparency
[2:25:18.200 --> 2:25:24.360]  and i absolutely think that if the american people could see what the fed really does
[2:25:24.360 --> 2:25:27.880]  and who benefits from their policies they realize that all this stuff about stimulating
[2:25:27.880 --> 2:25:32.280]  economy there's nothing to do with stimulating the economy it's about stimulating the bonuses
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:38.040]  on wall street that's right glenn jakem joins us here known as the wrestler kane and absolutely
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:44.360]  uh on target when it comes to the reality of the economics we face there's a reason since 1913 100
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:51.080]  years ago this week or next week um the 23rd during the christmas recess they snuck it through
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:56.680]  fraudulently gave us the income tax to pay that debt it allows them to manage and manipulate the
[2:25:56.680 --> 2:26:00.920]  economy it allows them to pick winners and losers it allows them to give themselves free money
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:06.280]  or at zero percent interest and that's how you've had this criminal consolidation of the ultra rich
[2:26:06.280 --> 2:26:10.920]  who then gang up and demonize the middle class because that's their only political opposition
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:19.000]  they want to make us poor on record and now you see since a hundred years ago a 98 percent
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:26.280]  devaluation in dollar buying power and it's accelerating now on the last two percent to
[2:26:26.280 --> 2:26:32.120]  devalue it on beef prices the stock market is over inflated it's not really 15 000 it just
[2:26:32.120 --> 2:26:38.200]  affects everything it's a giant fraud and it's important when it all comes down that we don't
[2:26:38.200 --> 2:26:43.560]  let them set up a world government with a whole new ponzi scheme of s dr's as they're calling for
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:48.360]  or their own fiat currency into another level it's important to bring them to justice
[2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:56.360]  understand the monetary policy is very important i follow kyle bass uh who did some great work in
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:04.040]  the lead up to the housing bubble and his prognosis is that japan is going to be next to be hit with
[2:27:04.040 --> 2:27:07.640]  the uh well yeah because of their demographics and because the fact that they've been printing
[2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:13.320]  money like crazy too then it goes back to europe then in you know again you can't really put a
[2:27:13.320 --> 2:27:18.200]  time frame on this but he says in in four to six years uh we'll see the debt problems emerge here
[2:27:18.200 --> 2:27:24.360]  in the us and you know folks that that's an enormous problem because if we can't sell our debt
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:28.520]  anymore the fed has to month which is already doing a great extent but if the fed has to completely
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:35.480]  buy the government's debt and has to monetize like crazy if the dollar per chance loses its reserve
[2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:41.000]  currency status that is if other countries around the world prefer not to trade in dollars or to hold
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:47.800]  dollars as backing for their own currencies we're in a lot of trouble because then all the inflation
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:51.720]  that this is what's happening now is when the fed prints money the inflation doesn't necessarily
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:55.800]  stay here in the us it goes into the capital markets like the stock market but also goes around the
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:02.440]  world if it doesn't do that and it stays here we will see a massive perhaps a hyperinflationary
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:08.440]  event and that will tear society apart and that's something we should be aware of of course and
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:12.440]  in closing in the two minutes we've got left we've been proven right that it's an international
[2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:18.600]  conspiracy uh that libor was staged even the rolling stone admits it's a conspiracy so that's
[2:28:18.600 --> 2:28:22.760]  all over instead of getting an apology i get demonized by the adl and southern bribery law center
[2:28:22.760 --> 2:28:28.280]  and msnbc because they're bought and paid for to try to block us ever getting our country back
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:34.280]  our country's been usurped we have to admit it's a corporate corporatist anti-free market group
[2:28:34.280 --> 2:28:40.440]  let's talk about world wrestling entertainment briefly uh what's the average political makeup
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:44.600]  there are people waking up there are more people going to speak out there where do you think that's
[2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:50.280]  going because you've used your fame to help promote uh liberty uh are other folks going to be joining
[2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:54.840]  you and are you and what are you doing running for political office i have no plans to run for
[2:28:54.840 --> 2:29:00.200]  political office now uh maybe in the future i might do that as far as my colleagues you know
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:03.320]  how it's the reason that most people don't pay attention to stuff is they're just trying to make
[2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:07.560]  a living man they're trying to taxes they're trying to take care of their families you know
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:12.120]  they're trying to deal with all the stuff that life life gives you in general and then on top of
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:17.800]  that we have this enormous paradigm shift which i believe is on the horizon um but you know like
[2:29:17.800 --> 2:29:23.320]  most people i think our guys they they do there's a libertarian streak and as far as oh yeah don't
[2:29:23.320 --> 2:29:27.320]  really like taxes that much because we're uh we have to pay our own taxes we're gonna pay the
[2:29:27.320 --> 2:29:32.440]  contractors which means that we have to write a check out to the rs and nothing will bring your
[2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:37.560]  religion faster that actually having to sit down and sign a big old check over to the uh well said

[2:33:18.600 --> 2:33:25.640]  by the way info wars nightly news is coming up tonight seven o'clock and we've got articles
[2:33:25.640 --> 2:33:34.840]  that just went up on info wars dot com dealing with the unprecedented attack on the first amendment
[2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:40.600]  the headline by carton m o duck dynasty it's not about the first amendment
[2:33:40.600 --> 2:33:47.640]  issue is about government handing out special rights to preferred preferential groups so i
[2:33:47.640 --> 2:33:52.920]  guess that's kind of a spin on it because i do agree it's about handing out preferential treatment
[2:33:52.920 --> 2:33:57.960]  to certain groups who are seen as political donors but more than that it is about an attack on
[2:33:57.960 --> 2:34:04.120]  free speech here's another one liberals declare duck dynasty christian views hate speech that's by
[2:34:04.120 --> 2:34:12.440]  kitt daniels those articles are up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and i get what
[2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:20.040]  kurt's saying there because it is about special interest but if they can take down this free
[2:34:20.040 --> 2:34:26.200]  speech and have a chilling effect a new mccarthy type era they can create blacklist they can
[2:34:26.200 --> 2:34:33.000]  silence opposition they will come after everybody and i mean come on so it's a little bit of country
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:39.080]  or some hillbilly can't go i like me or i like women not men i mean just come on
[2:34:40.200 --> 2:34:45.880]  didn't matter if you wanted to say i like hunting ducks or i like whatever it just goes on and on
[2:34:45.880 --> 2:34:52.120]  and on and it is so incredibly disgusting i know we have a bunch of callers we'll get to you after
[2:34:52.120 --> 2:34:57.800]  the special report live in studio with david nine duck dynasty it's not about the first amendment
[2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:05.960]  issue is about government handing out special rights to referential groups for political donations
[2:35:08.040 --> 2:35:14.760]  and it just goes on from there breaking it down and then of course as i said there's the article
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:20.920]  that kitt daniels did liberals i would call them authoritarian liberals declared duck
[2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:26.360]  dynasty christian views hate speech media goes beyond disagreement and push for chilling effect
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:33.560]  against free speech and that that i think is the core of it i'll get curtain here and do it's fun
[2:35:33.560 --> 2:35:38.760]  to get the respect for the writers that's what i want here is a different views on this but
[2:35:39.960 --> 2:35:44.760]  i mean i know there's many levels to this why they're pushing it's about depopulation
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:48.680]  breaking up the family having the moral high ground when they get rid of the bill of rights
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:53.400]  constitution while they sell us out to foreign banks while they debase the currency while they
[2:35:53.400 --> 2:36:01.480]  uh just engage in all different forms of crime with obama care oh but we have the new civil right

[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:14.520]  now shifting gears there has been quite a bit of debate about snowden the nsa whistleblower
[2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:20.040]  and greenwald and the london guardian and uh you know why are they holding back some of the
[2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:24.280]  documents and uh when greenwald was interviewed by ron paul you know he said some of the more
[2:36:24.280 --> 2:36:29.560]  sensational stuff we've held back uh and i think that could be said because they're afraid of the
[2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:32.440]  government coming after him if they really release a lot of stuff and they're doing criminal
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:37.560]  investigations of the guardian and they don't want to release stuff that burns innocent people
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:42.040]  because then it makes all the whistleblowers look bad that's the argument for them not being some
[2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:48.600]  limited hangout group and let me tell you they're really mad at snowden and uh i don't think snowden
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:54.520]  is a globalist operative i don't think this is dis info because i know about the nsa i've talked to
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:59.800]  the whistleblowers and the experts and the people that you know one even knows their names we told
[2:36:59.800 --> 2:37:03.720]  you everything about the nsa we told you how it worked what they were doing how they were predicting
[2:37:03.720 --> 2:37:07.640]  the future how they were giving it to corporate interest that's in the new white house report
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:11.880]  admitting they're using it for financial interest in select groups but spending it like to help
[2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:16.440]  america we need to stop doing that well shoot help america give us that nsa data it's helping
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:23.160]  globalism corner every market so it's a very balanced perspective that i have because it's
[2:37:23.160 --> 2:37:28.680]  so complex and we don't know the truth but they don't like this debate happening if it was a limited
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:33.880]  hangout spin for some reason or internal war between different government agencies or or groups
[2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:38.120]  it blew up in their face because this could bring the whole system down because they're
[2:37:38.120 --> 2:37:43.720]  lying about it forever saying they weren't doing it the fact that it's so illegal the fact that google
[2:37:43.720 --> 2:37:51.640]  and microsoft and all these companies and and at&t are up to their eyeballs up to you know their noses
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:58.440]  in this beyond 1984 tyranny and germany acts like they're not involved they're doing the exact same
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:03.640]  thing russia's doing a lot of this and it doesn't well since everybody's doing it let's do it no
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:08.600]  it shows how bad it's gotten we need to have a societal discussion about this and people need
[2:38:08.600 --> 2:38:16.280]  to get in trouble because they're already uh using this data more and more as they kind of come out
[2:38:16.280 --> 2:38:20.760]  with it and that's what's pacinics dr pacinic who i don't agree with a lot of stuff on i agree with
[2:38:20.760 --> 2:38:25.720]  some of it on but he's definitely an operative at many levels so represents some very serious camps
[2:38:25.720 --> 2:38:31.480]  in the system the military camp for one a branch of the army basically uh in their lobbying efforts
[2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:37.320]  so there's different factions here and he said it all happened alex they're just getting everybody
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:43.960]  ready to accept it it's the rollout now and it's he's right if no one gets in trouble and this doesn't
[2:38:43.960 --> 2:38:49.480]  get rolled back disclosure is almost worse now because it's a chilling effect of yeah we're
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:53.720]  watching you and what are you going to do and they're using it in court in non-terror related
[2:38:53.720 --> 2:39:00.120]  cases but because it's been illegal they make fake cases to then you know say they had evidence why
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:04.680]  they knew something was happening it's great to frame people and we have this case with larry
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:09.080]  claimant winning in federal court is going ahead to trial just saying yeah this is violating the
[2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:15.000]  fourth amendment no kidding it's violating the fourth amendment so my thing is i know i'm for real
[2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:19.960]  i know that you've got a big internal debate about this i think it's a good to debate it
[2:39:19.960 --> 2:39:24.440]  but i know i'm for real i know i'm not working for anybody i've said on air that i've had family
[2:39:24.440 --> 2:39:29.640]  that worked in black ops and even with the cia uh you know some of my more distant family but that
[2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:34.920]  doesn't that they said the government's bad they said i'm dead on their patriots they don't like
[2:39:34.920 --> 2:39:41.080]  what's happening that that's what i'm saying is that we we can't just decide we're all going to lose
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:46.280]  and that there could never be anybody good or that we could never take the country back
[2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:51.720]  and then anybody that has success must be an operative and so that's what i'm saying is i look
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:57.240]  at the fruits of this if it was a staged event which i don't think it was it's not going good for
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:03.720]  them and notice snowden wants to go to brazil now snowden wants out of russia now the russians
[2:40:03.720 --> 2:40:07.960]  are pretty good at figuring out if somebody's for real they clearly think he's for real but
[2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:16.440]  still he knows it's not safe over there with that group so uh the issue here is that snowden saw
[2:40:16.440 --> 2:40:21.320]  incredible evil he's a ron paul libertarian we've been told by folks that know him that
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:25.720]  but obviously he's told by the trendy liberal groups he it's more like this wiki leaks and
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:32.760]  kind of a leftist army are more the left wanting to be the good guys as the leaks come out they get
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:37.640]  them and then can spend them if they are agents or operatives that's the level it's said is that
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:42.680]  they know it's all coming out so they sit there play the part of the heroes make everybody think
[2:40:42.680 --> 2:40:46.760]  everything's been fixed everything's been taken care of that there is an opposition out there
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:51.000]  and so they can limitedly dole it out and that's what david night has basically said in his reports
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:55.720]  and i think there's some truth to that the question is though is that more because they're scared and
[2:40:55.720 --> 2:40:59.720]  they know they go all the way they'll be hammered with criminal indictments like are already happening
[2:40:59.720 --> 2:41:05.000]  with the guardian so look this is an important debate we don't know exactly what's happening
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:10.680]  i think it should be debated should be looked at but c bell admins who is a real whistleblower
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:14.600]  from the fbi with nsa intercepts who said our government was running al qaeda on the day of
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:20.200]  9 11 running the guns running slaves running everything criminal elements within insider
[2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:25.640]  trading it all came out they congressionally gagged her later she broke the gag order valiantly
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:30.600]  and came out with all that we've interviewed her many times you guys interviewed her earlier this
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:36.360]  week i guess tuesday night you interviewed her david and so this is very important and and she
[2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:41.480]  smells a rat and i don't think it's shower graves that she's a real whistleblower and and you know
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:47.000]  it's had her life you know attacked and now she sees all this happening i think she instinctively
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:52.440]  is right that why aren't they bringing out the real dirt but again that doesn't mean it's a
[2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:57.000]  total operation because again i experienced being told i'm an operation david you've been here now
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:01.800]  for quite a while no one's censoring what you're doing nothing you know this is a real operation
[2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:07.240]  promoting libertarian patriot americana ideas so so give us give us your so i'm just sick of
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:12.040]  everybody saying agent agent agent agent agent agent because i know there's a lot of good people
[2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:17.720]  in the system both in government corporate media who especially if stuff gets worse and worse we
[2:42:17.720 --> 2:42:22.840]  have to be ready for there to be opposition like cast sunstein said they would cognitively infiltrate
[2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:27.080]  and make people think all the opposition was government so that none of us could trust each
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:32.280]  other you know we've just got on faith step up and say no people out there listening they know
[2:42:32.280 --> 2:42:36.840]  they're good what is your gut before we get into the nuts and bolts of this what is your gut david
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:43.800]  night tell you about the whole wiki leaks snowden greenwald the whole nine yards well i don't know
[2:42:43.800 --> 2:42:49.160]  at this point i think that the snowden documents are authentic but being mismanaged by greenwall
[2:42:49.160 --> 2:42:54.280]  for his own personal benefit i think that's definite that's my concern about this so there's
[2:42:54.280 --> 2:42:59.080]  questions of journalistic uh ethics but there's even more important questions about what do we
[2:42:59.080 --> 2:43:04.760]  do about this police state it was just yesterday that we put on info wars an article from william
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:10.120]  benny now this guy is a bona fide nsa whistleblower this guy is a gold standard along with comma
[2:43:10.120 --> 2:43:16.040]  strike a lot of people in the early to mid 2000s after september 11th they noticed the switch in
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:20.760]  the nsa and a lot of internal people who are very high up in the nsa started blowing the whistle and
[2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:27.000]  said look the nsa is directing everything inward illegally in this country that's what madson says
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:31.880]  he says they weren't spying on the general public until recently well that's what they're saying now
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:36.840]  these these are people who william benney was taken a shower he had guns drawn on him while he's in
[2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:41.640]  the shower uh thomas drake they tried to send to jail for a very long time but they went through the
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:46.040]  process nobody paid any attention to them no mainstream media i mean go back and you can
[2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:51.400]  so you think that's the big issue is that they got so much attention i guess that is a point no no
[2:43:51.400 --> 2:43:55.720]  but part of it is listen a year ago he said he held his finger and his thumb close together and he
[2:43:55.720 --> 2:44:01.080]  said we're this close to police state yesterday the news article broke he said we are there we
[2:44:01.080 --> 2:44:06.040]  are now a police state we need to do something about this as of now only one percent of these
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:10.920]  documents from the snowden leaks have been published by greenwald is it going to take
[2:44:10.920 --> 2:44:15.560]  50 years put this out we don't have 50 years to roll back the police state we don't have 50 years
[2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:20.360]  to show people the most shocking stuff that the nsa is doing so it's almost used as a way to divert
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:24.440]  everybody from all the other news yes and the question is i mean i'm looking at this and we're
[2:44:24.440 --> 2:44:29.160]  setting up and doing the news we see these stories continually being leaked out and i think it's really
[2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:33.000]  kind of a boiling frogs type of thing i'm starting to look at this and say okay here's something about
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:38.120]  how they're spying on people in video games as they're playing video games it's inoculating the
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:43.160]  public to this this is kind of the traditional boiling frogs analogy which is what sebel edmunds
[2:44:43.160 --> 2:44:47.480]  is right so they go from totally denying it to like okay all right well yeah now we're just
[2:44:47.480 --> 2:44:52.280]  going to use it in court without warrants and and there's also questions about the fact that
[2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:58.520]  he has made this deal with paypal okay paypal has not been a friend of independent they've
[2:44:58.520 --> 2:45:02.680]  been big buddies of the nsa and they have the founder of it we played the clip yesterday going
[2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:06.360]  i like britney spears we should just let them do whatever they want you know this is this is
[2:45:06.360 --> 2:45:10.760]  what william benney said let me just read this to you because when she got information she got a tip
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:15.720]  sebel edmunds got a tip from somebody who is an anonymous foreign retired nsa person he says
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:20.600]  why hasn't anything come out about financial information especially about paypal because
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:26.200]  paypal is a giant global bank and all these giant global banks are getting information from the nsa
[2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:30.440]  and giving information to the nsa and by the way i think that's the big deal here even a green ball
[2:45:30.440 --> 2:45:34.680]  doesn't understand it and it's being used i just don't want to indict people without proof you know
[2:45:34.680 --> 2:45:40.120]  but i think right you're convincing me here there's a lot of stuff going on the big issue is google
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:46.120]  and microsoft and paypal and the big banks they are the nsa they got in the telecommunications
[2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:51.480]  act and others the funding to put the grids in they get first use of the data yes and i and
[2:45:51.480 --> 2:45:55.720]  we've known this forever we told everybody about the video games five years ago before snowden
[2:45:55.720 --> 2:45:59.960]  because you're right there were already a bunch of whistleblowers there were already 15 years ago
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:05.480]  eu meetings on this i mean that so yeah it's like kind of everything snowden put out's already
[2:46:05.480 --> 2:46:10.920]  been on the show exactly there's nothing new so far and he says the most this is what he said on the
[2:46:10.920 --> 2:46:16.200]  ron paul show in august 12th he said that snowden had very carefully vetted each one of these
[2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:20.600]  documents to make sure this is greenwald this is greenwald saying this on ron paul august 12th
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:25.080]  he said snowden has very carefully vetted each one of these documents documents to make certain
[2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:29.800]  that only ones who is giving me were ones that were in the public interest to know and reveal
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:34.440]  things that the public doesn't know that he felt the public should know but greenwald has held back
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:39.960]  on 99 percent of that information and why because he's got a multimillion dollar book
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:44.440]  contract coming up that's coming out in february or march which means that he's been holding this
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:48.440]  stuff back from the very beginning to write his book and then he takes this stuff takes
[2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:55.480]  so that's another thing why did wiki links want money before they released tpp info i don't know
[2:46:55.480 --> 2:47:00.200]  that they wanted money there was groups saying raise it crowd sourcing funding so yeah but i mean
[2:47:00.200 --> 2:47:05.160]  just come on we get documents we put them out i know but but the thing is that with these snowden
[2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:10.280]  documents he then takes these documents takes sole possession of the snowden documents greenwald
[2:47:10.280 --> 2:47:15.800]  and i think laura poitras has control of them as well they use that to set up a new media empire
[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:20.280]  as well as the book deal as well as the movie deals and so he's gone from being a journalist
[2:47:20.280 --> 2:47:26.680]  to being a source and not only that but pyramidi are is now buying this source well i'll say this
[2:47:26.680 --> 2:47:32.600]  i mean i mean i've released a major nsa info and it's turned out to be true and no one covers it
[2:47:32.600 --> 2:47:37.640]  that's right and again i'm not i just don't want to attack them because of envy and i want to believe
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:42.040]  in greenwald i want to believe in snowden i want to say because then they demonize him and it makes
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:47.320]  you say they're a hero because you want to support whistleblowing but then you say is the syop even
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:52.760]  more sophisticated i'll say this if it is a syop they're doing it as an emergency measure because
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:47:56.600]  they know the dam already broke so it's a victory either way david is what i'm saying they're not
[2:47:56.600 --> 2:48:02.280]  invincible i've just found this mindset that people think everything is a scam and it's not i'm real
[2:48:02.280 --> 2:48:07.080]  you're real all right i agree i think there's been a huge c-turn in this august interview with
[2:48:07.080 --> 2:48:11.640]  ron paul he pointed out correctly that it had made a c change in the way that people perceive
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:15.000]  the government of course people are very cynical now about the government yeah and i think they're
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:19.160]  smart enough to know i just don't know i think they're intimidated and scared being handled
[2:48:19.160 --> 2:48:23.240]  and managed by other people we're not hearing about who are manipulating them i'm telling you
[2:48:23.240 --> 2:48:28.120]  that's you people are not that smart i have met with ceo's billionaires and they're smart about
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:34.520]  their business but don't know about you know oliver cromwell or or they don't know about fission
[2:48:34.520 --> 2:48:38.360]  fusion or they don't know about they don't have a generalist knowledge you see what i'm saying well
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:43.000]  the concern that benny and cebel and others who are really whistleblowers are concerned about
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:47.800]  is that if it is perceived or if it's understood that these documents are being profiteered on
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:52.840]  that not only calls on the question the integrity of greenwald it takes them it takes all whistleblowers
[2:48:52.840 --> 2:48:57.400]  and whenever whistleblowers do come out no matter how they do it they are always demonized there's
[2:48:57.400 --> 2:49:01.000]  always ad hominem attacks they come after their character the personality and they want to make
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:05.640]  money they want to be famous so this well no look how they're going after larry claiming for winning
[2:49:05.640 --> 2:49:09.960]  saying oh he just wants to be famous winning against the nsa right so when he goes from a
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:14.680]  situation of being a journalist to being the source and then when that information is purchased
[2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:21.400]  in a clear case of checkbook journalism that really and reflects on the integrity of the whole
[2:49:21.400 --> 2:49:26.600]  operation here but at the same time you've got to have incentives to risk your life oh yeah uh
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:33.400]  in free speech and so uh i want whistleblowers to become rock stars and i just i just own the
[2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:39.000]  whole deal i say fine because because here's the issue they can put it back on the other foot
[2:49:39.560 --> 2:49:46.440]  and say that we are co-intel pro-ing or we are trying to you know i'm just saying that's the
[2:49:46.440 --> 2:49:50.600]  genius of what cast sunset i'm sure you read his papers yeah yeah from chicago and harvard
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:55.720]  right before went to the white house and he said do just this yes uh you know so infighting like
[2:49:55.720 --> 2:50:00.840]  you notice i never infight right and i think like ron poald isn't in fight i think we should
[2:50:00.840 --> 2:50:05.320]  analyze and be sophisticated and give people that you know inside baseball to think about this
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:10.200]  i just think we should also look at it and say this can be seen by any perspective so regardless
[2:50:10.200 --> 2:50:14.760]  we should make it about hey you lied to us and did and said you weren't spying on us we need
[2:50:14.760 --> 2:50:20.040]  congressional investigations we want in indictments i mean i want i want people to go to jail and what
[2:50:20.040 --> 2:50:23.080]  gives credence to what you're saying though and again i'm going back and forth it's so sophisticated
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:28.760]  the new white house commission on it says oh we are spying it's illegal we should stop and and they
[2:50:28.760 --> 2:50:35.320]  are using it for corporate you know uh leveraging but again they're the ones behind it and so and
[2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:38.600]  so they're having it both ways i don't want to make it about personal infighting i don't want to
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:43.080]  make it personally about greenwald but greenwald has made it about greenwald i want it to be about
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:46.840]  the documents and the way you make it about the documents is to release the document yeah what i
[2:50:46.840 --> 2:50:50.600]  would have done a book on it he can still do stay there i want to come back here right i would have
[2:50:50.600 --> 2:50:55.400]  he is hoarding i'm like a dragon on a polygold i would have sent it out to all the media and
[2:50:55.400 --> 2:50:59.880]  pointed out who i gave it to yeah that's what we do yeah i agree i would just fire it in every

[2:54:20.120 --> 2:54:25.080]  adan salazar's got an article going on the next 10 minutes to info wars dot com that basically
[2:54:25.080 --> 2:54:29.800]  crystallizes what i was talking about earlier folks all over talking about anti-religious
[2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:35.560]  bigotry how they're censoring free speech kicking the most popular brother off duck dynasty
[2:54:35.560 --> 2:54:42.040]  indefinitely for criticizing homosexuality it is a violation of the first amendment these mobs
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:49.720]  these new blacklist this is mccarthyite stuff on steroids on pcp and if they can do this they
[2:54:49.720 --> 2:54:54.360]  can chill everybody and so everybody's to get the article we've got coming out get out to everybody
[2:54:54.360 --> 2:55:01.480]  it's time to boycott the sponsors a&e all of it by the way i've been offered multiple a&e tv shows
[2:55:01.480 --> 2:55:08.680]  over the last decade act like an idiot you know i told a&e no thank you so the whole point is is
[2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:16.200]  that it's time to stand up now getting back to david night looking at the whole wiki leaks thing
[2:55:17.720 --> 2:55:24.120]  you know so much of it is i think though it almost even covering this i think it's good to do some
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:28.120]  it makes it about what's really going on or almost gives in to what they're planning
[2:55:28.120 --> 2:55:34.040]  instead of hey don't be spying on us it's illegal and not letting the nsa spin this is being done
[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:39.720]  for your safety and point out that the globalists are behind most the terror attacks i think almost
[2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:46.520]  even the debate about the celebrity of these leakers and things just from my media experience
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:51.400]  almost gives into it i just want to see these documents released and let me read from william
[2:55:51.400 --> 2:55:56.360]  benney he said the public is entitled to this information as i've said before sunlight transparency
[2:55:56.360 --> 2:56:01.880]  is the only thing that can bring bring the needed changes it is the only cure this is from a guy who
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:06.360]  left his comfortable position at a very high position at the nsa and they came after him as a
[2:56:06.360 --> 2:56:11.560]  whistleblower and he's been working at this ever since we see just today that wolsey comes out and
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:15.480]  says it's known should be hanged by the neck if convicted of a jury of his peers well you know what
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:20.280]  there isn't a jury and the secretive flies the court that these guys have created at least he's
[2:56:20.280 --> 2:56:25.960]  talking about juries but how about let's see james clapper standing before a jury and keith alexander
[2:56:25.960 --> 2:56:30.680]  for lying to congress for violating their oath of office for violating the constitution let's
[2:56:30.680 --> 2:56:36.760]  see some of this and let's get the most sensational the most shocking stuff out now i agree we need to
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:41.320]  see you're off of this like you said setting on a pile like smog the dragon you know i mean it's
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:45.560]  like he's got this pile of gold that he's setting on and he's doling it out we need to get this
[2:56:45.560 --> 2:56:49.720]  information out i'm not going to brazil you're not going to brazil we're staying here to fight
[2:56:49.720 --> 2:56:53.800]  for this country and that's what we want to see happen is we want to see this information come out
[2:56:53.800 --> 2:56:57.400]  and you're right we don't want to make this about greenwald we don't want to make about snowden
[2:56:57.400 --> 2:57:03.080]  it has to be about it not even about the document pile it needs to be about the nsa and we've known
[2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:07.560]  all this for a long time but it's all made about snowden are we going to hang snowden are we going
[2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:12.440]  to capture snowden are we going to put greenwald in jail is greenwald going to get a big well here's
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:18.360]  the deal if greenwald wasn't being protected somehow he'd have his wrist slit and pills put
[2:57:18.360 --> 2:57:23.080]  down his throat like dr david kelly so there's definitely a bunch of different groups here
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:27.400]  and different factions are using it against each other i think that's more of what's going on here
[2:57:28.200 --> 2:57:32.840]  but uh david night thank you so much for that discussion and you're continuing to do a great
[2:57:32.840 --> 2:57:36.760]  job of enforce nightly news thank you thank you my friend and by the way david's going to be doing

[3:01:05.800 --> 3:01:12.040]  but it reads like a prophecy he warned about the pandora's box this would open up and now just look
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:17.000]  at the filth we have been taught in schools a number of abortions and people are just spiritually

[3:02:50.920 --> 3:02:57.240]  eric go ahead hey alex hey i've i've i've tried to call a long time i've been holding a long time
[3:02:57.240 --> 3:03:04.360]  on try to be brief um richard dina anderson uh the actor that uh played macgyver he also
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:11.400]  was on a show uh s s g started s g one there's a lot of parallels that you talk about all the time
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:16.200]  with that show in particular if you're not familiar there's a race that they've met
[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:23.080]  through their wormhole that's called the ashen and their basic plan is to um make us better
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:28.520]  but in the long run they they uh they make it so we can't breathe in and it's total control
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:33.080]  there are a lot of parallels with everything that you've said i've been listening for a couple years
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:39.320]  with that show s g one started s g one i would love to hear uh a guy like richard dina anderson
[3:03:39.320 --> 3:03:44.120]  or the producer of that show johnson glassner interesting i'd have to be familiar with it
[3:03:44.120 --> 3:03:47.960]  to do it but we should focus more on pop culture because that's where the real battle's going on
[3:03:47.960 --> 3:03:55.080]  the real the real programming is going on very interesting point yes sir this i've tried for
[3:03:55.080 --> 3:03:59.000]  a couple years i've wanted to bring this up to you and and i've tried to call a bunch of times but
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:04.760]  i'm glad i got through today i know you know it's it's separation by seven degrees somebody out
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:09.320]  there somewhere is listening that knows those people individually and i have to believe that
[3:04:09.320 --> 3:04:14.360]  they're listeners johnson glassner and richard dina and we have an incredible group of people
[3:04:14.360 --> 3:04:18.280]  listening thing is tracking them down getting them on i appreciate your call i'm gonna give them 45
[3:04:18.280 --> 3:04:24.200]  seconds rocko last caller sorry to susan uh go ahead in north carolina alice i've been amazed
[3:04:24.200 --> 3:04:29.640]  how big this push is for an article five constitutional convention that's because they
[3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:33.480]  can rewrite the whole thing and they got a lot of conservatives behind it and i think it's a trap
[3:04:34.040 --> 3:04:39.560]  you know it's bruce fine the work who works for ron paul is behind it glenn beck just got on the
[3:04:39.560 --> 3:04:46.360]  bandwagon mark levin is for this uh could i plug a website well they think because there's so many
[3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:51.560]  libertarians and patriots waking up and i like bruce fine and all them let's get bruce fine on
[3:04:51.560 --> 3:04:56.120]  i've not tomorrow on monday about this because we could debate a con con because that could be a
[3:04:56.120 --> 3:05:22.040]  way to reverse all this and all the bad amendments but it could be it's a bit it's a gamble
