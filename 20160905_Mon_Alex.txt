[00:00.000 --> 00:05.940]  Alex Jones here with huge breaking news. Hillary Clinton in her own words in FBI
[00:05.940 --> 00:10.780]  testimony released today told the FBI that she had amnesia, didn't remember the
[00:10.780 --> 00:16.620]  emails, the servers, any of it. In her own words she says she is unfit to be
[00:16.620 --> 00:18.980]  president.
[00:21.540 --> 00:27.820]  These things are predictable but it's still hard to believe that the FBI has
[00:27.820 --> 00:32.080]  been pressured for months to release their research data dump on Hillary
[00:32.080 --> 00:36.280]  Clinton because even if they're going to roll over and not charge her for the
[00:36.280 --> 00:40.300]  crime she's publicly committed they should at least release them. So now with
[00:40.300 --> 00:46.240]  Labor Day coming up and having this holiday on Friday they predictably
[00:46.240 --> 00:53.040]  released the data dump at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time. Knowing that Americans
[00:53.040 --> 00:56.520]  are busy going to pick their kids up at their school and to get ready for the
[00:56.520 --> 01:01.720]  long three-day weekend. A lot of what's in the data dump we've already seen but
[01:01.720 --> 01:08.160]  tons of it is new. We knew about 33,000 emails that she never turned over that
[01:08.160 --> 01:15.400]  disappeared. That was already admitted. Now they admit to 17,500 emails that they
[01:15.400 --> 01:20.620]  said weren't there that they'd previously denied to give over that were on the
[01:20.620 --> 01:24.760]  servers. So they basically gave the FBI this needle in a haystack and hope they
[01:24.760 --> 01:28.480]  wouldn't notice that a lot of it was hiding in plain view. But here's the big
[01:28.480 --> 01:37.480]  news from the FBI and it's on screen for TV viewers. Hillary Clinton over and
[01:37.480 --> 01:42.600]  over and over again dodged subpoenas, wouldn't testify to Congress, wouldn't
[01:42.600 --> 01:46.320]  talk to the FBI, wouldn't answer their questions and it was even in the news at
[01:46.320 --> 01:50.640]  the time in 2013. Where is she? She's in the hospital for almost a year. Well now
[01:50.640 --> 01:56.160]  the FBI has gone public and said that Hillary Clinton told them years ago and
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.680]  then again recently that because she had a traumatic brain injury, a
[02:00.680 --> 02:10.200]  concussion, she had amnesia and didn't remember. This is so huge because this is
[02:10.200 --> 02:14.400]  what Matt Drudge for three years has been saying. It's what Obama's former
[02:14.400 --> 02:18.880]  doctor is saying. It's what Dr. Drew got fired for saying. It's what my guests
[02:18.880 --> 02:22.180]  like Dr. Steve Pacinica have been saying. Hillary Clinton clearly has
[02:22.180 --> 02:26.320]  neurological problems. Donald Trump comes out and says he's having to take naps
[02:26.320 --> 02:30.320]  all the time. She only gives a few speeches a week. She's low energy. This is
[02:30.320 --> 02:36.160]  not presidential material. WikiLeaks shows that she was trying to get drugs
[02:36.160 --> 02:41.600]  for Parkinson's. It goes on and on. The weird seizure-like behavior that being
[02:41.600 --> 02:45.480]  helped up by Secret Service. Her doctor coming over with a tranquilizer pen
[02:45.480 --> 02:49.440]  saying it's okay. It's okay when somebody yells something in the crowd. This
[02:49.440 --> 02:54.440]  woman is clearly a basket case a lot of the time and is having serious problems
[02:54.440 --> 02:59.640]  and the word is she had brain surgery multiple times during that year in the
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.200]  hospital that overlapped 2012-2013. They've not released her full medical
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.640]  records. They've released only a snippet from an earlier doctor in New York. So
[03:08.640 --> 03:14.520]  this is such a big deal that Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, not Alex
[03:14.520 --> 03:19.760]  Jones, not Matt Drudge, not Breitbart, not World Net Daily, not Vladimir Putin, not
[03:19.760 --> 03:24.160]  the Kibler Elves. We're all told this is a theory from Vladimir Putin. We're all
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.000]  getting orders. Hold on. Putin what do I say? Okay I'll say it right now. No, you
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.640]  look like hell. You've been in the hospital. You're falling down. You've got
[03:31.640 --> 03:38.040]  all these problems. You're in the hospital for a year and now you, Hillary
[03:38.040 --> 03:46.680]  Clinton, told the FBI that you couldn't remember anything you did because you had
[03:46.680 --> 03:53.360]  such a serious brain injury. You need to be evaluated by an outside group of
[03:53.360 --> 03:57.640]  independent nonpartisan brain surgeons, neurologists, and others just as we've
[03:57.640 --> 04:04.280]  been calling for for six months. You need to actually debate Donald Trump and not
[04:04.280 --> 04:08.240]  just have back-to-back discussions with him, likes coming up in the first meeting.
[04:08.240 --> 04:14.520]  And you need to be held accountable for being caught having classified material
[04:14.520 --> 04:18.440]  on your servers you lied about. The FBI's come out now and released the evidence.
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.520]  The FBI's Hillary email probe found evidence of effort to evade federal
[04:22.520 --> 04:27.360]  records law. That's what made the head of the EPA have to step down. Three years
[04:27.360 --> 04:32.000]  ago was having a fake set of records as well. You have absconded from the law.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.120]  You've been caught and it's time for the crime syndicate. You represent the
[04:37.120 --> 04:42.800]  Bush and Clinton crime family to ride into the sunset. If you don't, it's pretty
[04:42.800 --> 04:46.680]  clear that your health's gonna catch up with you, the law's gonna catch up with
[04:46.680 --> 04:50.680]  you, and public opinion has already caught up with you. You've been caught red-handed.

[04:58.320 --> 05:05.200]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com. Matt Lauer will moderate the first forum
[05:05.200 --> 05:10.680]  between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday, September 7th, NBC News and
[05:10.680 --> 05:15.960]  MSNBC, along with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, will
[05:15.960 --> 05:20.440]  host the Commander-in-Chief Forum in New York City. It will be a one hour long
[05:20.440 --> 05:24.640]  forum where Clinton and Trump will answer questions about national security. The
[05:24.640 --> 05:30.600]  two candidates, though, will not be on stage at the same time, but instead will
[05:30.600 --> 05:36.280]  go back to back. Once again, Hillary Clinton is too scared to get on the same
[05:36.280 --> 05:41.840]  stage as Donald Trump. She's a coward. Where's Hillary? She's not in Louisiana.
[05:41.840 --> 05:46.840]  She's not in Mexico. She's not on the same stage as Donald Trump because she's
[05:46.840 --> 05:53.800]  sick. She's demented and she can't actually debate. She's scared. You can

[05:58.480 --> 06:02.880]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be
[06:02.880 --> 06:07.040]  cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial
[06:07.040 --> 06:11.680]  particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune
[06:11.680 --> 06:16.040]  systems. The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa
[06:16.040 --> 06:20.600]  Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure
[06:20.600 --> 06:24.720]  Breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[06:24.720 --> 06:29.440]  your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite
[06:29.440 --> 06:33.200]  are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things
[06:33.200 --> 06:37.400]  that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general
[06:37.400 --> 06:43.240]  public doesn't. The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One
[06:43.240 --> 06:47.640]  of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm
[06:47.640 --> 06:50.920]  personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive
[06:50.920 --> 06:54.960]  filters that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so
[06:54.960 --> 06:59.360]  revolutionary today at infowars.com.
[06:59.360 --> 07:03.760]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will

[08:19.680 --> 08:29.680]  Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[08:30.680 --> 08:37.520]  Isn't it funny? You know, when I came here 17 years ago and I said that I wanted
[08:37.520 --> 08:43.560]  to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed
[08:43.560 --> 08:49.080]  at me. Well, I have to say you're not laughing now, are you? I come to you from
[08:49.080 --> 08:53.760]  the United Kingdom with a message of hope and a message of optimism. It's a
[08:53.760 --> 08:58.440]  message that says if the little people, if the real people, if the ordinary
[08:58.440 --> 09:04.200]  decent people are prepared to stand up and fight for what they believe in, we can
[09:04.200 --> 09:11.280]  overcome the big banks. We saw the commentary at and we saw the polling
[09:11.280 --> 09:16.600]  industry doing everything they could to demoralize our campaign. On the day of
[09:16.600 --> 09:23.880]  the vote itself, that morning, they put us 10 points behind. And actually, they
[09:23.880 --> 09:28.280]  were all wrong. And they were wrong because what the Brexit campaign did is
[09:28.280 --> 09:34.360]  we reach those people who've been let down by modern global corporatism. We
[09:34.360 --> 09:39.880]  reach those people who have never voted in their lives but believe by going out
[09:39.880 --> 09:44.400]  and voting for Brexit, they could take back control of their country, take back
[09:44.400 --> 09:49.160]  control of their borders and get back their pride. Folks, the message is clear.
[09:49.160 --> 09:52.960]  The parallels are there. There are millions of ordinary Americans who've
[09:52.960 --> 09:57.880]  been let down, who've had a bad time, who feel the political class in Washington
[09:57.880 --> 10:03.240]  are detached from them, who feel so many of their representatives are politically
[10:03.240 --> 10:09.040]  correct parts of that liberal media elite. They feel people aren't standing up
[10:09.040 --> 10:13.480]  for them and they've actually, in many cases, given up on the whole electoral
[10:13.480 --> 10:19.240]  process. And I think, I think that you have a fantastic opportunity here with
[10:19.240 --> 10:24.600]  this campaign. You can go out. You can beat the pollsters. You can beat the
[10:24.600 --> 10:29.200]  commentators. You can beat Washington.
[10:29.200 --> 10:34.600]  And now he joins us to the bottom of the hour. Nigel Farage, a major historical
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.480]  figure, just a normal businessman, a family man who 25 years ago saw their
[10:39.480 --> 10:43.440]  sovereignty being destroyed, didn't get elected to office till 99. Now the fastest
[10:43.440 --> 10:48.880]  growing party, not just in the UK, but Europe. And it's just classic renaissance
[10:48.880 --> 10:53.760]  Magna Carta 1776, whatever you want to call it. It's amazing to have been
[10:53.760 --> 10:56.000]  interviewing this guy for 15 years. It's been a few years since he's been able to
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.040]  come on. He joins us to talk about all of this. But the parallels between he and
[11:00.040 --> 11:05.200]  Donald Trump, where Trump's never been in office either, are simply amazing.
[11:05.200 --> 11:08.160]  We're going to talk about it all. Here's the Washington Post, Financial Times,
[11:08.160 --> 11:12.840]  and others today saying, with globalization in danger, G20 double down and are
[11:12.840 --> 11:16.320]  trying to defeat nationalism. They say if Hillary is defeated, it's the end of the
[11:16.320 --> 11:21.560]  New World Order. This is an epic time. Mr. Farage, who just recently resigned as
[11:21.560 --> 11:25.800]  the head of UKIP still in the EU parliament. Wow. Talk about a David
[11:25.800 --> 11:31.400]  versus Goliath story. This is epic. What it is. I think the point about Brexit, Alex,
[11:31.400 --> 11:37.600]  is Brexit is the first victory. We've had little victories. We've had, you know, the
[11:37.600 --> 11:42.320]  odd election that's gone well for people in, whether it's in Germany or France or
[11:42.320 --> 11:48.360]  wherever it may be. But Brexit is the first strike back against this phenomenon.
[11:48.360 --> 11:53.240]  This phenomenon of the big banks, the big businesses, effectively owning
[11:53.240 --> 11:59.400]  politics, literally willfully destroying nation-state democracy. Get rid of that
[11:59.400 --> 12:04.320]  thing that our forebears actually fought and shed their blood to create and to
[12:04.320 --> 12:09.880]  preserve our liberties, our freedoms, all of that being taken away and suddenly,
[12:09.880 --> 12:17.000]  suddenly in a referendum that no one said we could win. I mean, literally, nobody
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.720]  thought Brexit would succeed and we've done it. We've done it and I think what
[12:22.720 --> 12:27.240]  we've done is given inspiration to freedom fighters right across the Western
[12:27.240 --> 12:34.680]  world. Wow. Where should we begin in the limited time we have here, Mr. Farage? The
[12:34.680 --> 12:40.560]  election here, how Brexit? Yeah. Well, let's talk about Hillary, shall we? Please do.
[12:40.560 --> 12:48.160]  If you can bear it. I mean, Hillary represents everything that has gone
[12:48.160 --> 12:54.880]  wrong in our lives in the last couple of decades. She is part, a dynastic part, you
[12:54.880 --> 13:00.600]  know, of that class of people who have taken us into an endless series of foreign
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.960]  wars, but I think arguably have made things worse, certainly in Liberia and
[13:04.960 --> 13:11.040]  elsewhere, not better. But she is part of that phenomenon where all that seems to
[13:11.040 --> 13:17.280]  matter now is corporatism. You know, the big global companies who want to set the
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.880]  rule books to effectively put out a business, small and medium-sized
[13:20.880 --> 13:25.840]  competitors, they have destroyed, you know, what I believe to be proper free
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.960]  market capitalism where your eye can go and set up a company, you know, and have
[13:29.960 --> 13:34.120]  a real chance of succeeding. And they presided over a period where the rich have
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.560]  got richer and where ordinary decent working people have seen their living
[13:39.560 --> 13:45.320]  standards deteriorate. She represents failure. And she, of course, is completely
[13:45.320 --> 13:51.120]  unreconciled to the vote on Brexit because Hillary loves the European Union. She
[13:51.120 --> 13:55.240]  loves these supranationalist global type bodies. In fact, I think she sees the
[13:55.240 --> 14:00.800]  European Union as a prototype for an even bigger form of world government. And I
[14:00.800 --> 14:05.720]  would just say this to people. You know, I condemned Obama when he came to the
[14:05.720 --> 14:11.040]  United Kingdom during our referendum. He looked down his nose at Britain and the
[14:11.040 --> 14:15.360]  British people. He told us that if we dared to vote for our independence and our
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.160]  democracy, that America would basically throw us off the edge of a cliff, forget
[14:20.160 --> 14:23.680]  about everything we've done and shared together, you know, over these last few
[14:23.680 --> 14:29.800]  years. And I condemned Obama for doing that. So I'm not going to tell people how
[14:29.800 --> 14:35.840]  they should vote in the USA, but let me make it clear. If you want nothing to
[14:35.840 --> 14:41.960]  change at all, if you want to continue with the kind of cronyism that we see
[14:41.960 --> 14:46.480]  with the Clinton Foundation and everything else, if you want things to
[14:46.480 --> 14:51.240]  stay the same, you vote for Hillary. But if you think there's an opportunity here,
[14:51.240 --> 14:54.760]  particularly in the wake of Brexit, for us to start doing things differently in
[14:54.760 --> 14:59.040]  the Western world, then she's the last person you should vote for. And I said,
[14:59.040 --> 15:03.920]  at the Mississippi rally, I said, I wouldn't vote for Hillary if you paid me.
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.120]  I said, actually, I wouldn't vote for Hillary if she paid me. And I feel pretty
[15:09.120 --> 15:13.280]  strong. And I feel pretty strongly about that. Well, I mean, it's come out in the
[15:13.280 --> 15:17.320]  New WikiLeaks documents, which she admits are accurate, that she's actually was
[15:17.320 --> 15:20.680]  selling influence to the Chinese president. I mean, this is even beyond
[15:20.680 --> 15:26.520]  espionage. I don't know how she and speaking of the devil, George Soros has
[15:26.520 --> 15:31.720]  tried to crash your country as well and did crash the pound. If you look at this,
[15:31.720 --> 15:35.200]  he wants the internet to be run by the United Nations and basically the EU.
[15:35.200 --> 15:39.560]  He's come out now and said he wants the UN to run our police. And people laugh at
[15:39.560 --> 15:43.880]  that, but the UK got brought into the European Union without ever having a
[15:43.880 --> 15:47.280]  vote. These things are done by stealth. It's a real warning, I think, to the
[15:47.280 --> 15:52.160]  United States. Oh, yes, it happens incrementally, little piece by little
[15:52.160 --> 15:57.560]  piece. You know, we joined just over 40 years ago. We joined something that my
[15:57.560 --> 16:02.080]  parents' generation were told, don't worry your little heads. This is just
[16:02.080 --> 16:06.400]  about trade. It's just about jobs. It's just about being friendly with our
[16:06.400 --> 16:11.760]  neighbors. And bit by bit, you know, we finished up in a situation where 75% of
[16:11.760 --> 16:16.680]  our laws weren't even made in the House of the Parliament. They were made in the
[16:16.680 --> 16:21.080]  European institutions. We finished up with a system where under the European
[16:21.080 --> 16:27.120]  arrest warrant, any British citizen could be extradited to Greece or Bulgaria or
[16:27.120 --> 16:32.360]  anywhere else without the production of prima facie evidence, which, you know,
[16:32.360 --> 16:36.320]  from a country that actually developed Magna Carta, it really is quite a
[16:36.320 --> 16:43.200]  surrender. And we finished up, you know, we finished up being banned from making
[16:43.200 --> 16:47.160]  our own trade relationships and our own formal relationships with any other
[16:47.160 --> 16:51.640]  country in the world. And it's like, the analogy Alex, I've been given, it's like
[16:51.640 --> 16:57.600]  if you get a lobster, right? Yes. And you chuck it into a pan of hot water, it will
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.400]  shriek and shout and try and get out because it knows something bad's
[17:01.400 --> 17:05.960]  happening. They actually shriek. Yes, they yell. Oh, they do. No, they really do. But if
[17:05.960 --> 17:12.320]  you put a lobster into cold water, right, and turn on the heat, actually what
[17:12.320 --> 17:17.840]  happens is the lobster just gently falls asleep and finishes up being cooked. And
[17:17.840 --> 17:21.560]  I think that's what happened to the United Kingdom. We were put into cold
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.840]  water back in 19th century. You thought it was a hot tub and you went to sleep and
[17:25.840 --> 17:31.640]  woke up in an EU tyranny. Yeah. And I, you know, I was one of those people who 25
[17:31.640 --> 17:37.960]  years ago, and I don't know quite how or why, but 25 years ago, I started
[17:37.960 --> 17:43.600]  looking at this, and I just said, this is wrong. By the way, Nigel, I don't, you
[17:43.600 --> 17:46.600]  don't like to talk about yourself, but this is a part of history. You were a
[17:46.600 --> 17:50.720]  successful business guy, your family guy, whole nine yards. It's been in the news.
[17:50.720 --> 17:54.000]  They've taken the, you know, the, the bolts off your car's tires, even the
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.200]  French police said, look like they tried to kill you, your airplane crashed, all
[17:57.200 --> 18:01.880]  this stuff. I mean, what made you 25 years ago decide to just strike out by
[18:01.880 --> 18:06.040]  yourself and now epically change the world? I mean, this is a success story
[18:06.040 --> 18:12.040]  for everybody out there. It's actually very simple, very, very simple indeed.
[18:12.040 --> 18:18.240]  You know, in every town, in every village in my country, there are memorials,
[18:18.240 --> 18:25.280]  war memorials to those that fell both in the first and second world wars fighting
[18:25.280 --> 18:32.000]  for us to stay as an independent, free, proud democratic nation and to stop
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.720]  tyranny in Europe. And I felt that what the European project was becoming was the
[18:37.720 --> 18:43.040]  very kind of tyranny that those before us had fought to stop. And nobody was
[18:43.040 --> 18:47.920]  asking me or telling me I had to put on a military uniform and carry a rifle. All
[18:47.920 --> 18:52.760]  I had to do was get involved and form a political party and get people to support
[18:52.760 --> 18:58.040]  it. And I've never wavered from that view in 25 years. The information, the
[18:58.040 --> 19:01.200]  information war, Nigel Farage, incredible. We've only got about 10 minutes
[19:01.200 --> 19:04.080]  left before we do another interview. You've resigned from the party, but you're
[19:04.080 --> 19:08.120]  still in the EU parliament. You're still working hard. Can you just briefly, for
[19:08.120 --> 19:12.840]  folks that want to know, explain, I mean, I understand that for 25 years, why
[19:12.840 --> 19:17.320]  you've pulled back right on the, I mean, that was a huge victory. Yeah, well, there
[19:17.320 --> 19:21.480]  are two reasons. One is that there are two different types of people in politics.
[19:21.480 --> 19:26.040]  There are those who want to be something, who want the title, who want the
[19:26.040 --> 19:32.080]  chauffeur driven car, who want the grandiose sort of stage to be on. But there
[19:32.080 --> 19:36.120]  are other people in politics because they're in it for a purpose. And my
[19:36.120 --> 19:40.800]  specific purpose was to free my country from this European project. So having
[19:40.800 --> 19:45.400]  achieved that goal, I said, look, I'm not retiring. I'm not moving up into the
[19:45.400 --> 19:49.720]  mountains and living in a, you know, living in a tin shed. But I'm going to
[19:49.720 --> 19:54.320]  step back from leadership. And that's going to leave me free to make this
[19:54.320 --> 20:00.480]  argument, not just in the United Kingdom, not just in the EU parliament, but
[20:00.480 --> 20:04.000]  around other parts of the Western world. And when you and I met each other in
[20:04.000 --> 20:09.240]  Cleveland at the Republican convention, that was the first time in years I'd
[20:09.240 --> 20:13.520]  been free without having to represent a political party to go out and look
[20:13.520 --> 20:17.920]  around the world. And I will, you know, as I'm talking to you tonight, I will
[20:17.920 --> 20:21.240]  make these arguments in the American elections, and I will go around the free
[20:21.240 --> 20:25.520]  world saying to people, let's take back what we've lost. The second reason, if
[20:25.520 --> 20:32.240]  I'm Frank, is that doing this for a quarter of a century, doing a job that
[20:32.240 --> 20:38.200]  absorbs you 24 seven. It's exhausting. No time. Leaves you no time to catch a
[20:38.200 --> 20:42.600]  fish. Leaves you no time to see your kids grow up. I, you know, I'm now going
[20:42.600 --> 20:46.120]  to work, Alex, 50 or 60 hours a week, not 100 hours a week. I get it, sir. I
[20:46.120 --> 20:50.560]  totally understand and thank God you created UKIP. I mean, you're a modelist.
[20:50.560 --> 20:54.640]  I mean, everything else. Look at how every EU country has a major
[20:54.640 --> 20:58.640]  Brexit-style movement in the poll show that we're going to see huge victory
[20:58.640 --> 21:01.480]  here. So I want to talk about that in a moment, how the Empire is going to
[21:01.480 --> 21:04.880]  strike back, how the Socialists and Communist bureaucrats and mega banks are
[21:04.880 --> 21:12.600]  going to strike back. But getting into overall what globalism is up to these
[21:12.600 --> 21:23.200]  days, are they crying, foul and saying that they're in deep trouble as a way to
[21:23.200 --> 21:26.840]  get governments to desperately go along with them? Or is it accurate that
[21:26.840 --> 21:31.360]  they're on their heels? I mean, I've got a stack of news articles here saying U.S.
[21:31.360 --> 21:34.280]  led globalism is dying. And of course, they mean globalists run
[21:34.280 --> 21:38.640]  globalism is dying. Yeah. With the TPP, New World Order in trouble,
[21:38.640 --> 21:42.880]  Soros in trouble. I mean, they claim they're in really, really deep trouble.
[21:42.880 --> 21:46.880]  And I look at the facts. It looks like they are. But then I ask, how are they
[21:46.880 --> 21:50.520]  going to bring us into a depression? Are they going to crash our currencies again?
[21:50.520 --> 21:54.760]  I mean, this is the usual suspects. How is the Empire going to strike back?
[21:54.760 --> 22:00.840]  The Empire is bewildered. The Empire is befuddled. The Empire still cannot, just
[22:00.840 --> 22:05.280]  as I said about Hillary earlier in this interview, the Empire doesn't get Brexit
[22:05.280 --> 22:09.520]  because the Empire didn't believe Brexit was possible. And now the Empire's problem
[22:09.520 --> 22:13.120]  is that it's fighting this argument on several fronts at once. You know, we've
[22:13.120 --> 22:20.200]  got the American elections going on. We've got a big referendum coming up in
[22:20.200 --> 22:26.120]  Hungary on migrant quotas from Germany. We've got a rerun of the Austrian presidency
[22:26.120 --> 22:31.840]  where the right-wing candidate was cheated by false votes. So they've got
[22:31.840 --> 22:37.240]  a real problem. They are fighting us now on a whole series of fronts. What will they
[22:37.240 --> 22:40.600]  do to fight back? I don't know the answer to that yet. And do you know something?
[22:40.600 --> 22:45.880]  Nor do they, because over the course of the last few decades, all of their plans,
[22:45.880 --> 22:50.920]  piece by piece, to build these new structures, they've won every single
[22:50.920 --> 22:54.520]  battle. Some of them have taken them longer than they wanted, but they won
[22:54.520 --> 23:00.720]  every single battle. After Brexit, they're in trouble. And I have to say that
[23:00.720 --> 23:06.440]  these American elections, you know, this could be a result globally far bigger
[23:06.440 --> 23:12.840]  even than Brexit. You know, if America, if America is the leader of the Western
[23:12.840 --> 23:18.520]  world, once again becomes the leader of the free world, well, then I think
[23:18.520 --> 23:23.360]  basically we would have done away with the globalist. Well, sir, you're right. The
[23:23.360 --> 23:28.560]  Washington Post said two weeks ago that Hillary's a referendum and that Brexit
[23:28.560 --> 23:33.520]  was the first domino and that she's the second. And if she falls, they say it's
[23:33.520 --> 23:37.440]  irrevocable because they, in their own documents that we've gotten from BAMP
[23:37.440 --> 23:42.160]  Canada, North American Union meetings, 10 years ago, they admit, they say it's key
[23:42.160 --> 23:46.280]  that we maintain stealth and secrecy. If the public ever finds out, North
[23:46.280 --> 23:49.880]  American integration and our plan will fail. That's a quote. I mean, it's like a
[23:49.880 --> 23:54.960]  James Bond villain. We've caught them. You've exposed them. I don't see how they
[23:54.960 --> 23:58.320]  can continue when it comes out that they're dictatorial. But first, since you
[23:58.320 --> 24:01.280]  mentioned Hillary, I don't know if you saw her big national speech last week. She
[24:01.280 --> 24:05.760]  attacked myself, you and others. She, she attacked Donald Trump like it was bad
[24:05.760 --> 24:10.560]  that he was associated with somebody like you who's changing the world and
[24:10.560 --> 24:14.120]  loved all over the place. Even the left has happened to admit you've got good
[24:14.120 --> 24:19.000]  points. And so let's play this clip of Hillary acting like Trump's bad because
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.840]  he's modeling himself after a winner like you. Here it is.
[24:21.840 --> 24:28.720]  Nigel Farage, who stoked anti-immigrant sentiments to win the referendum to have
[24:28.720 --> 24:32.560]  Britain leave the European Union campaign with Donald Trump in Mississippi.
[24:32.560 --> 24:38.080]  And then Paul Watson in the piece he did on this went on to say, hey, Hillary and
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.160]  Nigel Farage won. Don't forget that part. I think this really illustrates her
[24:42.160 --> 24:47.800]  disconnect, sir. Well, I just want to, can I please use this opportunity to thank
[24:47.800 --> 24:53.960]  Hillary Clinton from the bottom of my heart for doing what she's done. She's
[24:53.960 --> 24:58.560]  raised my profile massively in this presidential election. She's made me a
[24:58.560 --> 25:03.600]  political football between the Trumpites and the Clintonites. And she's given me
[25:03.600 --> 25:08.400]  an even bigger platform in the United States of America to say to people,
[25:08.400 --> 25:13.240]  we've just won our democracy back. Why don't you do the same thing? So Hillary,
[25:13.240 --> 25:17.960]  thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So here's the paradox. They've got the money.
[25:17.960 --> 25:20.560]  They've got the power. They've stolen control. They got the Swiss bank accounts
[25:20.560 --> 25:24.200]  like the EU bureaucrats that don't pay taxes. You've exposed all that, but people
[25:24.200 --> 25:28.160]  are waking up. They're unelected. They're dictatorial. That's an uphill battle for
[25:28.160 --> 25:30.720]  them. The problem is they're already on top of the hill. How do you see this
[25:30.720 --> 25:34.320]  playing? I mean, if I agree with you, they don't know how to counter. They're
[25:34.320 --> 25:38.160]  panicked right now. I've never seen the media so deceptive. They seem to be
[25:38.160 --> 25:43.720]  doubling down. Yeah, what we've got to do, what we've got to do is to focus on
[25:43.720 --> 25:49.320]  what we can do. And what we can do is to go out and reach the millions, tens of
[25:49.320 --> 25:55.240]  millions of people across the Western world who frankly feel completely
[25:55.240 --> 26:00.280]  disconnected and disenchanted with politics. You know, we've been through
[26:00.280 --> 26:05.240]  these years where frankly, whichever party you vote for doesn't make very much
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.120]  difference. And where people say, you know what? I'm not going to bother. It
[26:09.120 --> 26:13.920]  makes no difference. And what we have to do is we have to inspire those people.
[26:13.920 --> 26:19.480]  We have to say to those people, come on, get up off your backside, get down to
[26:19.480 --> 26:24.680]  that polling station, vote, because it's only by us getting together and doing
[26:24.680 --> 26:28.000]  what we think that we can change things. And that's the lesson, Alex, from
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  Brexit. Nearly two and a half million people who don't vote or have never
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.920]  voted in their lives went out on June the 23rd and turned it into our
[26:37.920 --> 26:41.360]  independence. Total history. And of course, they're trying to ignore the vote.
[26:41.360 --> 26:44.240]  It's a battle, but they're going to lose in the end. This is amazing. They can't.
[26:44.240 --> 26:48.280]  They can't. In the minute we have left. They can't ignore the vote. So I would say
[26:48.280 --> 26:53.640]  to people, if you want change in America, then, yeah, listen to these shows, talk
[26:53.640 --> 26:56.520]  to your friends and neighbors, but actually, you've got to get your walking
[26:56.520 --> 27:00.880]  boots. Knock on doors. Got to get out and meet people, inspire people. And if you
[27:00.880 --> 27:05.440]  do that, we'll strike a blow against the globalist from which they will never,
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.800]  ever recover. Absolutely. In the minute we have left, sir, I just want to say that
[27:09.800 --> 27:12.840]  obviously you've not really retired. You're here battling the New World Order
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.280]  globally now. You've actually gone to the next level. And I appreciate your time,
[27:17.280 --> 27:22.400]  your energy, and the risk you've taken for yourself and your family. Of course,
[27:22.400 --> 27:26.160]  UKIP.org, the former party you headed up. And of course, people can also follow you
[27:26.160 --> 27:31.360]  on Twitter. We'll put that on screen for TV viewers as well. But this is a great
[27:31.360 --> 27:35.880]  historic time and is a referendum against the New World Order. And I think
[27:35.880 --> 27:39.240]  Donald Trump's going to win. If all of our listeners and others do what you say
[27:39.240 --> 27:45.080]  and take action. So thank you for spending your time trying to help America be a
[27:45.080 --> 27:49.320]  free country as well, Mr. Farage. No, not one little bit. And I'll be back between
[27:49.320 --> 27:56.720]  now and November the 8th. Thank you so much, sir. Bye-bye. Thank you. I mean,
[27:56.720 --> 28:02.640]  more implores is making history. And that big old amplifier, drudgerport.com, is
[28:02.640 --> 28:08.480]  watching our six. And we're watching drudges six and everybody else's. But I
[28:08.480 --> 28:10.800]  tell you, they tried to kill him over and over again. And I'm not going to get
[28:10.800 --> 28:16.800]  into it, but they've taken the bolt-off as tires. The police said that somebody
[28:16.800 --> 28:20.840]  tried to kill him. They mess with his brake lines, his airplane crashed. And
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.440]  that guy basically just marches around all over Europe. You name it with no
[28:24.440 --> 28:30.000]  bodyguards. Basically, he is, he's, he's a real deal. I have young children and
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.120]  I've never had bodyguards. And I've gotten the point with stuff going on about
[28:33.120 --> 28:37.640]  the scenes that I do. And I'm hired former highly decorated army people that
[28:37.640 --> 28:41.600]  are part of security details worldwide. But that's the type of stuff we have to
[28:41.600 --> 28:50.440]  deal with. Our Blitzer Kimmel stories also on drudge. It's getting crazier. And
[28:50.440 --> 28:53.520]  just to look at the anatomy of propaganda, we'll cover that when we come
[28:53.520 --> 28:59.120]  back. But history's happening. Big things are happening. The fight against
[28:59.120 --> 29:03.280]  tyranny is taking place. And people are deciding what side they're on. You can't
[29:03.280 --> 29:09.640]  read the Soros emails. Even the liberal publications are now coming out and
[29:09.640 --> 29:13.960]  saying, okay, Soros is really bad. Okay, he wants to overthrow countries. He wants
[29:13.960 --> 29:18.160]  to create racial division. He wants to destabilize things. It's all there. I mean,
[29:18.160 --> 29:23.640]  a moron would not be able to tell this. A really big moron, an average moron
[29:23.640 --> 29:28.680]  would be able to. I mean, this is crazy. And it doesn't mean the Republicans are
[29:28.680 --> 29:32.120]  gonna save us either. But Trump is an insurrection taking over the Republican
[29:32.120 --> 29:36.360]  party with the populism. And that's why they're throwing everything they've got
[29:36.360 --> 29:42.240]  against him. But Nigel Farage, ladies and gentlemen, making history 25 years
[29:42.240 --> 29:46.920]  ago, starting out having a huge victory. Imagine where info worlds will be in
[29:46.920 --> 29:53.880]  four years. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[29:53.880 --> 29:55.720]  GCN radio network.
[29:59.320 --> 30:04.840]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Crazy Pope Pope Francis global warming a sin man
[30:04.840 --> 30:09.720]  could atone by recycling and carpooling says the guy writhing around in a
[30:09.720 --> 30:15.200]  freaking fishbowl. Mercedes big global warming continues doing part to human
[30:15.200 --> 30:20.320]  activity. Francis says adding that 2015 was the warmest year on record in
[30:20.320 --> 30:25.560]  2016 will likely be warmer still. This is leading to ever more severe droughts,
[30:25.560 --> 30:30.520]  floods, fires and extreme weather events. Climate change is also contributing to
[30:30.520 --> 30:34.840]  the heart rendering refugee crisis. And the reason the radical Islamists run
[30:34.840 --> 30:38.500]  around beheading gays and cutting women's heads off and mutilating their
[30:38.500 --> 30:43.360]  genitalia. Damn that heat. That's so bad. The world's poor, though least
[30:43.360 --> 30:47.400]  responsible for climate change are most vulnerable and already suffering its
[30:47.400 --> 30:53.240]  impact. He wrote today. Thank God that none of the crazy pope is there to save
[30:53.240 --> 30:56.360]  the day. You can find more reports like this at info wars.com.
[30:56.360 --> 31:02.200]  Not a group. You developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do
[31:02.200 --> 31:06.600]  it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[31:06.600 --> 31:11.360]  that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't
[31:11.360 --> 31:15.560]  put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now
[31:15.560 --> 31:20.120]  we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to
[31:20.120 --> 31:23.320]  your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the
[31:23.320 --> 31:28.360]  refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on
[31:28.360 --> 31:31.480]  everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's
[31:31.480 --> 31:34.760]  so many things that are in it. You have the name in there. You have the organic
[31:34.760 --> 31:39.400]  clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at
[31:39.400 --> 31:42.520]  least twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm
[31:42.520 --> 31:45.640]  going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday living defense info
[31:45.640 --> 31:49.040]  wars live.com and folks, you can't lose full of stuff. It's great for your body.
[31:49.040 --> 31:54.360]  Period. And you support the broadcast info wars live.com. Thank you Dr. Group
[31:54.360 --> 31:57.280]  from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this
[31:57.280 --> 32:02.880]  great product. We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best
[32:02.880 --> 32:07.640]  nutraceutical that we can produce. Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop
[32:07.640 --> 32:11.160]  DNA force for us. It's been something that I've been working on for a long
[32:11.160 --> 32:15.880]  time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important. What the aging process is
[32:15.880 --> 32:21.200]  is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres
[32:21.200 --> 32:24.800]  are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes. And when it runs out, you
[32:24.800 --> 32:29.480]  start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[32:29.480 --> 32:33.400]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an
[32:33.400 --> 32:38.840]  antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor. So this is a formula to
[32:38.840 --> 32:43.560]  deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form. We have so many five star
[32:43.560 --> 32:48.000]  reviews. I take this. This is this is the product that I take. InfoWarsLife.com
[32:48.000 --> 32:51.400]  and the profit we make. We fight the global. We fight the new world order.

[33:00.040 --> 33:11.600]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat UK hospitals.
[33:11.600 --> 33:17.560]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people. But now children are
[33:17.560 --> 33:22.520]  literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the
[33:22.520 --> 33:33.200]  UK. They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity. The powdered
[33:33.200 --> 33:38.320]  flesh from dead babies. Some people believe they can cure disease. Because of
[33:38.320 --> 33:44.320]  its enormous popularity, Soil and Green is in short supply. Remember, Tuesday is
[33:44.320 --> 33:49.640]  Soil and Green Day. The supply of Soil and Green has been exhausted. You must
[33:49.640 --> 33:58.320]  evacuate the area. The shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group
[33:58.320 --> 34:04.080]  Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for and
[34:04.080 --> 34:08.660]  the flavoring, but we already know. So enjoy the flavor. We're going to get the
[34:08.660 --> 34:12.080]  real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and and sales
[34:12.080 --> 34:17.200]  taxes. I'm consistently pro-death. I'm for assisted suicide. I'm for regular
[34:17.200 --> 34:20.560]  zeroes. I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving. Is spending a million
[34:20.560 --> 34:24.640]  dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better
[34:24.640 --> 34:30.960]  not to lay off the those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off and medical cost?
[34:30.960 --> 34:34.560]  But that's called the death panel. And you're not supposed to have that
[34:34.560 --> 34:40.560]  discussion. They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become
[34:40.560 --> 34:53.000]  unreliable. Is this the kind of society that you want to live in? Any kind of
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.400]  society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior
[34:56.400 --> 35:01.160]  citizens. It will do it to its dissidents. That kind of society will also
[35:01.160 --> 35:05.720]  eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the
[35:05.720 --> 35:10.680]  fizzlings and the collaborators who make that possible. This is nothing but a
[35:10.680 --> 35:19.680]  suicide cult. The scoops are on their way. The scoops are on their way. I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[35:19.680 --> 35:25.920]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life. You will find out why Soylent Green
[35:25.920 --> 35:45.200]  means death. It's all about dehumanizing us. And that's what socialists and
[35:45.200 --> 35:49.560]  status do everywhere, whether it's the Soviet Union or Venezuela or Cuba or
[35:49.560 --> 35:53.480]  North Korea. Every communist system becomes a total collapse nightmare,
[35:53.480 --> 35:57.440]  except for China because of the classic, hard-working, intelligent nature of the
[35:57.440 --> 36:01.760]  Chinese people who are the ultimate free market folks. If you go to the cliches,
[36:01.760 --> 36:06.520]  they're true. They have a bifurcated system with communists on top, ruling over a
[36:06.520 --> 36:11.240]  bunch of slaves, basically, and free market allowed in certain areas to
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.840]  basically take over the world. The ultimate merger of crony capitalism with
[36:15.840 --> 36:19.880]  communism. Lord Christopher Montin is joining us until about five after the
[36:19.880 --> 36:23.880]  next hour. The Nigel Farage, kind of an Anglophile-type transmission today,
[36:23.880 --> 36:26.960]  because so much the resistance against the new orders coming out of the
[36:26.960 --> 36:33.000]  British Isles. Lord Montin is the former top advisor. He doesn't brag about that,
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.560]  but if you look it up to Margaret Thatcher, also been a major newspaper editor,
[36:36.560 --> 36:43.880]  a scientist, a major inventor, and, of course, someone who is the leading person
[36:43.880 --> 36:47.120]  in publishing scientific papers, some of the most read in the world, or the most
[36:47.120 --> 36:51.080]  read in the world, on the fact that anthropogenic global warming is a fraud.
[36:51.080 --> 36:56.360]  The problem is, and it's now been in even the Associated Press, 14 attorney
[36:56.360 --> 37:00.440]  generals and governors have been meeting in secret, looking to arrest prominent
[37:00.440 --> 37:05.240]  man-made climate change deniers, and they're actually on the news now pushing
[37:05.240 --> 37:09.200]  this. Now, I wanted to get him on last week, but he was too busy to talk about
[37:09.200 --> 37:15.520]  this meme saying that we don't want Hillary Clinton because she's a woman.
[37:15.520 --> 37:19.640]  I mean, I would elect a libertarian, conservative, nationalist, patriot,
[37:19.640 --> 37:23.920]  free-market woman in a heartbeat. I love to have a woman president. I'd like it.
[37:23.920 --> 37:29.880]  I don't want a kingpin whose emails just came out that she's actually was paying
[37:29.880 --> 37:33.520]  access for others against the Chinese president. This has now reached espionage
[37:33.520 --> 37:37.160]  level. That's confirmed. George Soros has come out in the new emails that have been
[37:37.160 --> 37:40.960]  hacked, and he admits their real email saying, the UN will run the US police,
[37:40.960 --> 37:44.280]  and the UN will run the internet. These are from three years ago, and they'll
[37:44.280 --> 37:49.240]  censor critics of his foundations and not allow us to have voices. So they want
[37:49.240 --> 37:53.280]  to arrest us. They want to shut down the web. Hillary puts out fundraisers two
[37:53.280 --> 37:56.680]  weeks ago, emails saying, Breitbart doesn't have a right to exist, and the
[37:56.680 --> 38:02.720]  alt-right needs to be shut down. And then she comes out and names us by name.
[38:02.720 --> 38:07.160]  Alex Jones, Breitbart, Drudge Report. They're coming after us. They're in the
[38:07.160 --> 38:12.160]  news almost every day saying arrest Monkton. These people, we go down to the
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.840]  Democrat crowds down here, nicely interview them, and they start saying they
[38:15.840 --> 38:20.320]  want to kill me. So Lord Monkton, you've always called them Nazi-like, and people
[38:20.320 --> 38:24.720]  overused that, but in this case it's really true. I don't think people realize
[38:24.720 --> 38:28.800]  what's happening. Are they doing this because they're panicking? Are they
[38:28.800 --> 38:32.320]  doing this because they believe this is their time to take over? What is
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.880]  the arrogance? Is it a put on? Is it real? You're a real psychological expert on
[38:36.880 --> 38:41.000]  this. I want to spend some time on powerful women in history, and one of
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.760]  the most, you know, Margaret Thatcher, an incredibly great lady who served
[38:43.760 --> 38:47.360]  Bilderberg, who stopped the euro early on, but after she got out, they pushed it
[38:47.360 --> 38:51.440]  through. I mean, you know, a true nationalist, a true smart, amazing,
[38:51.440 --> 38:57.560]  eloquent woman versus this brand of Samantha Powers and man-hating,
[38:57.560 --> 39:02.200]  nation-hating, wealth-hating, war-loving. I mean, it's bizarre. So I want to talk
[39:02.200 --> 39:06.360]  about that, and also some of the latest developments. Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[39:06.360 --> 39:11.160]  Thank you so much, sir. Well, it's a pleasure to be with you, and let's start
[39:11.160 --> 39:15.880]  with women at the top in politics. What is interesting is that in the United
[39:15.880 --> 39:21.120]  Kingdom, it was not just a member of the Conservative Party who became Britain's
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.480]  first Prime Minister, but actually a real Conservative, because most of the
[39:25.480 --> 39:29.080]  Conservative Party members in Parliament are not really Conservatives at all, but
[39:29.080 --> 39:33.960]  Margaret Thatcher was a Conservative, and she became Britain's first woman
[39:33.960 --> 39:40.320]  Prime Minister. So the idea that somehow people are opposed to Hillary Clinton
[39:40.320 --> 39:45.240]  just because she's a woman, I think are very far from the truth. I think they're
[39:45.240 --> 39:50.760]  opposed to Hillary Clinton and rightly because she's a crook, and in law, it
[39:50.760 --> 39:54.200]  doesn't matter whether you're a male or a female. If you're a crook, you're a crook.
[39:54.200 --> 39:59.720]  And the hacked emails that are gradually coming out show that she is and was and
[39:59.720 --> 40:04.560]  will probably continue in office to be a crook if the people are unwise enough to
[40:04.560 --> 40:09.760]  elect her. And so, no, there is no prejudice against women on our side of
[40:09.760 --> 40:15.920]  the debate, far from it, as you have just so very eloquently said. You'll elect a
[40:15.920 --> 40:21.800]  woman provided that she is libertarian and is in favour of peace, low taxes, and
[40:21.800 --> 40:26.040]  none of the hideous totalitarian experiments that you showed in that
[40:26.040 --> 40:32.400]  clip before this segment began. The idea that in Britain now we're using babies
[40:32.400 --> 40:38.840]  as fuel in hospitals. Now this, of course, is the ultimate ghastliness that even
[40:38.840 --> 40:44.840]  Dr. Mengele didn't think up in Nazi Germany. And what is astonishing is the
[40:44.840 --> 40:51.800]  lack of self-criticality on the part of the communist or fascist left, because
[40:51.800 --> 40:55.240]  of course the communists and the fascists are really two sides of the same
[40:55.240 --> 41:01.160]  hard-left coin. In fact, if one goes back to China that you mentioned earlier, the
[41:01.160 --> 41:06.760]  early Chinese imperial philosophers said, right, there are the the big divide in
[41:06.760 --> 41:11.560]  politics, and it still is the big divide today, thousands of years later, is between
[41:11.560 --> 41:16.320]  the totalitarians, they call them the legalists, and the confusions we call
[41:16.320 --> 41:20.880]  those the libertarians. So the totalitarians versus the libertarians.
[41:20.880 --> 41:24.520]  And now the totalitarians have learned to claim they're the real liberals, but
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.160]  they're not. No, of course they're not. I mean, the word liberal doesn't apply to the
[41:29.160 --> 41:32.440]  likes of Hillary Clinton. It doesn't apply to the so-called Democrats. Indeed,
[41:32.440 --> 41:36.520]  the word Democrat doesn't apply to the Democrats either. They're not Democrats.
[41:36.520 --> 41:41.320]  They don't believe in elections. They're merely a stepping stone on the way to
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.720]  total totalitarian control. You just have to look at the number of treaties that
[41:45.720 --> 41:49.880]  Mr. Obama has busily been trying to put in place. Look at the euro.
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.840]  Euro is a good example. We, thank goodness, stayed out of that. I worked very, very
[41:54.840 --> 41:58.120]  hard to make sure that we did. Yeah, I should have added you're a major leader of
[41:58.120 --> 42:01.280]  that as well. And of course, it's not about credit, but people need to know why
[42:01.280 --> 42:05.720]  you're so derided and attacked. I mean, you were like a just as important as, say,
[42:05.720 --> 42:09.440]  our George Washington in our beginning in this fight against the New World Order.
[42:09.440 --> 42:12.720]  I mean, it's epic to be able to talk to you about that.
[42:12.720 --> 42:17.280]  I guess you're everywhere, but the truth is that these battles do have to be fought,
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.960]  and they have to be fought very hard because the international totalitarian
[42:22.960 --> 42:28.080]  left are hoping that they can take over. Why, for instance, are these 14
[42:28.080 --> 42:35.640]  attorney generals conspiring, for it is a conspiracy, to try to move against that
[42:35.640 --> 42:40.400]  provision in your Constitution, which guarantees free speech, by saying that
[42:40.400 --> 42:44.160]  those of us who are doing academic research and quite good academic research
[42:44.160 --> 42:48.600]  at that, say, I, suggesting that they've over-egged the pudding on global warming
[42:48.600 --> 42:53.080]  should be locked up, should be imprisoned for daring to have a point of view
[42:53.080 --> 42:58.000]  other than that of the totalitarian state. Now, this takes us right back to
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.880]  Hitler, and there's no point in in not saying so. Of course, they will immediately
[43:01.880 --> 43:06.600]  say, oh, yes, whenever the right get fed up, they say that the socialists are, you
[43:06.600 --> 43:10.520]  know, that Hitler was a socialist. Well, yes, he was. It was a socialist
[43:10.520 --> 43:14.440]  worker's party of Germany. Of course, he was left-wing. That's the name of it, and
[43:14.440 --> 43:16.920]  then the left is lied and said he was right-wing, but let's, let's expand on
[43:16.920 --> 43:19.320]  this briefly, because I want to get back to Margaret Thatcher. I've never had you
[43:19.320 --> 43:21.560]  want to talk about her, and sometimes when you've got a full hour, I know he had
[43:21.560 --> 43:24.040]  some mix-ups today. I'd like to just spend a whole hour on her. She's so
[43:24.040 --> 43:27.640]  interesting with the selections over. What would Margaret Thatcher think today?
[43:27.640 --> 43:29.720]  I mean, you're somebody I know from reading newspaper articles that with
[43:29.720 --> 43:34.000]  advisors, sometimes hours a day, she, you know, she really, really, you were
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.160]  meant to remain confident. She really trusted you. She was a really smart lady,
[43:37.160 --> 43:40.840]  and obviously she was smart to trust you. You're a really smart guy, obviously. What
[43:40.840 --> 43:44.080]  type of person was Margaret Thatcher? Why was she willing to buck the entire
[43:44.080 --> 43:49.000]  globalist system, and why don't we see more leaders like her? Why don't we see
[43:49.000 --> 43:55.800]  more men like her? I think the reason is that in politics, it's much a government
[43:55.800 --> 44:00.920]  by its nature tends to be on the totalitarian rather than on the
[44:00.920 --> 44:05.880]  libertarian side. Government is about control, sometimes for good ends, usually
[44:05.880 --> 44:10.080]  for bad and selfish ends, but it is about control, and therefore there is a
[44:10.080 --> 44:15.600]  tendency in every governing system to move towards totalitarianism, and one of
[44:15.600 --> 44:19.080]  the exciting things about the constitutional developments that began
[44:19.080 --> 44:24.760]  in the era of Magna Carta and carried on steadily, and of course the American
[44:24.760 --> 44:30.120]  Revolution is part of that tradition, of transferring power back from the
[44:30.120 --> 44:35.520]  totalitarian center and into the hands of the people. You know, the American
[44:35.520 --> 44:40.560]  Revolution was fundamentally a libertarian exercise, as was Magna Carta,
[44:40.560 --> 44:45.520]  and as was the election of Margaret Thatcher and her political triumph. These
[44:45.520 --> 44:51.720]  movements towards libertarianism were and are and continue to be valuable, but
[44:51.720 --> 44:56.400]  of course the totalitarians don't like this. They don't like democracy, they
[44:56.400 --> 45:00.280]  don't like the idea that the people can have this. They're furious that the
[45:00.280 --> 45:05.200]  people, by a substantial majority of more than a million votes, voted down the
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.960]  European Union and voted for Brexit. Why did they, why did we do this? Because we
[45:09.960 --> 45:14.920]  wanted once again to be free. I was talking to a cab driver on the way to a
[45:14.920 --> 45:19.840]  radio interview shortly before the vote, and he said, I'm going to vote to stay
[45:19.840 --> 45:24.600]  in, and I said, may I suggest why you shouldn't? And he said yes, and I told him
[45:24.600 --> 45:29.080]  how an EU law is made, which is exactly how the left want to make laws
[45:29.080 --> 45:32.400]  everywhere. No democratic input whatsoever, the whole thing done by
[45:32.400 --> 45:37.400]  commissars behind closed doors. And at the end of this brief account by me of
[45:37.400 --> 45:41.440]  how a law is actually made in the European Union, he said, right, I'm voting the
[45:41.440 --> 45:44.240]  other way, I'm voting to get out, and I'm going to tell all my friends they've got
[45:44.240 --> 45:49.040]  to do the same to save our country from this totalitarian takeover. So there is
[45:49.040 --> 45:54.160]  now a real battle going on, a battle which you've been fighting with more
[45:54.160 --> 45:59.080]  than usual prescience and still more than usual vigor for many decades, which is
[45:59.080 --> 46:05.440]  between those who wish to shut down all opposition, and this time not just on a
[46:05.440 --> 46:09.560]  national but on a global level. And that's the significance of Obama and his
[46:09.560 --> 46:14.040]  treaty making. That's the significance of Obama and China ganging up together.
[46:14.040 --> 46:18.600]  Come on, we're all communists together. Let's lock the West into this climate
[46:18.600 --> 46:25.920]  nonsense by ratifying the climate treaty. Now, of course, Obama can't actually
[46:25.920 --> 46:29.280]  ratify the climate treaty because your Senate has to approve it.
[46:29.280 --> 46:32.560]  I want to give that a moment, but since you I was about to interrupt when you
[46:32.560 --> 46:37.080]  led into this, I see articles every day in the in the Economist, the Financial
[46:37.080 --> 46:41.480]  Times of London, the New York Times, I think of the Washington Post, I've got a
[46:41.480 --> 46:46.040]  stack of them here. We're not here hyping the fact that this is an epic battle.
[46:46.040 --> 46:51.520]  Literally, scienceandpublicpolicy.org, Mark Moreno and Climate Depot, DrudgeReport.com,
[46:51.520 --> 46:56.080]  in full wars, WorldNet Daily, Daily Caller Breitbart, are now the new media. We get more
[46:56.080 --> 46:59.320]  traffic than the mainstream media. They know that. They're scared. We are the
[46:59.320 --> 47:03.160]  legitimate media. We're not perfect, but we really want to tell the truth. We're
[47:03.160 --> 47:06.680]  nationalist. We're not into scams. We don't want to join the authoritarians. I
[47:06.680 --> 47:11.680]  know you could have joined them. I could have joined them. They admit that we are
[47:11.680 --> 47:15.440]  now defeating them at this point. They are in full crisis mode and say we must
[47:15.440 --> 47:19.840]  get Hillary elected. Brexit and UKIP and Nigel Farage and Lord Monkton is
[47:19.840 --> 47:22.960]  spreading everywhere. If the next domino falls, this is the Washington Post. We're
[47:22.960 --> 47:28.320]  over. The G20, as you know, is set to meet and their new focus is nationalism
[47:28.320 --> 47:34.000]  from Spain to the UK to the United States to Australia, rising there in
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.600]  panic modes. We're not just sitting here telling you all this and saying we've
[47:39.600 --> 47:43.960]  got a fighting chance, but the enemy's going to strike back. This is epic. Just
[47:43.960 --> 47:47.720]  as you were finally able to reach that cab driver in a few minutes, wake him up
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.760]  with the outrageousness of the authoritarianism of the EU, what is that
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.760]  that that that blow that will finally take them down? Because I know they're
[47:56.760 --> 48:00.320]  winning at some level because they're still in control and they have the money,
[48:00.320 --> 48:03.800]  but they're losing the intellectual battle. What I'm getting at is how are
[48:03.800 --> 48:07.520]  they going to strike back? What do we do Lord Monkton? Because we are now
[48:07.520 --> 48:11.880]  standing in in huge history. Our listeners are just as important as we
[48:11.880 --> 48:16.280]  are in history. This information war is so important what you just illustrated.
[48:16.280 --> 48:20.800]  Now, we have a mechanism which is very useful in United Kingdom. I've used it
[48:20.800 --> 48:24.000]  against the BBC. I've used it against government departments. It's called
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.280]  judicial review, administrative action. It's not particularly expensive, but you
[48:28.280 --> 48:33.960]  know how to work system. And it allows if if a public authority oversteps the
[48:33.960 --> 48:37.720]  market, and that's what totalitarians do. They'll always go beyond what the law
[48:37.720 --> 48:42.680]  allows. Here is Obama saying I'm going to ratify the climate treaty personally.
[48:42.680 --> 48:48.080]  Now, in Britain, if a Prime Minister said I'm going to ratify a treaty and the
[48:48.080 --> 48:52.120]  Prime Minister didn't have the power to ratify a treaty, I would be able to go
[48:52.120 --> 48:55.040]  straight to the court. It would take precedence over all other business of
[48:55.040 --> 48:57.560]  the administrative court, which is a division of the High Court in London, and
[48:57.560 --> 49:03.800]  say no, she can't do that and it would be stopped. Now, you do have a similar
[49:03.800 --> 49:08.560]  system in the United States, but the libertarians are not always as smart as
[49:08.560 --> 49:14.760]  they should be about using the existing mechanisms that are available to you to
[49:14.760 --> 49:20.200]  stop, for instance, outrageous overstepings of the market by the EPA or by
[49:20.200 --> 49:23.800]  Obama saying he's going to ratify a treaty he has. So what do we do then? How
[49:23.800 --> 49:27.680]  do we strike back? So what you do is you choose your issue carefully. Let us
[49:27.680 --> 49:33.680]  suppose that Obama does eventually try to purport to ratify personally a treaty
[49:33.680 --> 49:37.840]  which your Constitution plainly states can only be ratified by a two-thirds
[49:37.840 --> 49:43.400]  majority of the Senate. Then all it takes is one person to go to the Federal
[49:43.400 --> 49:47.920]  District Court on judicial review and say the President has exceeded his
[49:47.920 --> 49:52.880]  authority and I want this looked at and then stopped and that will bring the
[49:52.880 --> 49:55.480]  whole nonsense down. All right, let me expand on that. That was done by the Texas
[49:55.480 --> 49:58.600]  Attorney General, he was then set up and indicted, but it's a fake case, he's
[49:58.600 --> 50:02.880]  doing okay. Literally the dinner party, he just talked about a company he was in
[50:02.880 --> 50:06.320]  years before and said I think it's a good investment. Oh my gosh, he's so evil. The
[50:06.320 --> 50:09.200]  Justice Department comes after him. I'm gonna skip this break folks, it's too
[50:09.200 --> 50:12.320]  important. According to all the free speech, we don't do this. This battle's
[50:12.320 --> 50:18.480]  total. And then the Supreme Court and others ruled okay, Obama is not allowed
[50:18.480 --> 50:22.680]  to just ignore law and let illegals in and not even test them for diseases. Stop.
[50:22.680 --> 50:27.360]  And Obama said I'm not stopping. What do you do at that point when he is a naked
[50:27.360 --> 50:34.040]  Tyrannosaurus? Well he is then in contempt of court and you go back to the court for
[50:34.040 --> 50:39.580]  an order requiring him to stop. That's right, where is the Supreme Court on an
[50:39.580 --> 50:44.000]  injunction? There's Congress. With that court order could be prosecuting Obama
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.560]  impeachment. If you go to the court and you say you've made an order, Obama has
[50:50.560 --> 50:53.960]  decided to flout it. If that's what's happened here and I haven't looked at
[50:53.960 --> 50:57.980]  this. Well the artist Scalia was gonna rule against him. But if that's what's
[50:57.980 --> 51:02.920]  happened, then he is in contempt of court and if you go back to the court and you
[51:02.920 --> 51:08.720]  say you gave this order, he is ignoring it, then they can issue an
[51:08.720 --> 51:14.360]  order for his arrest and imprisonment until he agrees to comply with the order
[51:14.360 --> 51:18.480]  of the court. And that's what you should do. It's not expensive. It is your right.
[51:18.480 --> 51:22.240]  And the court, if it has made a plain judgment and he is plainly flouting it,
[51:22.240 --> 51:27.760]  has no choice. Even if it's stacked with all his cronies, it has no choice but to
[51:27.760 --> 51:32.400]  order his arrest. And that's what you've got to start to do. I mean I did this a
[51:32.400 --> 51:36.080]  few years ago when the British government was trying to pass a thing
[51:36.080 --> 51:40.000]  called the mass trick-to-treaty, which was the latest stage then of locking us
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.440]  into this EU monstrosity. And I discovered that against Parliament's
[51:44.440 --> 51:49.280]  instructions, they'd been spending taxpayers' money on various aspects of
[51:49.280 --> 51:53.200]  the mass trick-to-treaty, even though we hadn't at that time ratified it. And this
[51:53.200 --> 51:57.960]  was contrary to the law. I took them to the court of session in Edinburgh, which is
[51:57.960 --> 52:03.120]  the equivalent of the Court in London. And the Attorney General for Scotland, the
[52:03.120 --> 52:08.360]  Lord Advocate, as he's called, had to come personally to try to defend himself in
[52:08.360 --> 52:14.920]  court. And in the end, he won on a technicality because the EU budget at
[52:14.920 --> 52:19.840]  line 14,973 for the previous year had overruled the British Parliament's
[52:19.840 --> 52:23.120]  decision. And the British Parliament had never read this document, so it didn't
[52:23.120 --> 52:27.480]  even know. And on that technicality, we lost the case. But then they came after
[52:27.480 --> 52:32.280]  me for their expenses. And I said, no. And they said, you've got to pay them,
[52:32.280 --> 52:37.720]  because you came second. And I said, no, I won't. Instead, I want to know the date
[52:37.720 --> 52:41.600]  of the Lord's Advocate's proposed resignation from office. And they said,
[52:41.600 --> 52:44.680]  what do you mean? I said, those are my instructions. I told my solicitors, you
[52:44.680 --> 52:48.720]  tell them that. So they told the Lord Advocate's office that I wanted to know
[52:48.720 --> 52:51.800]  when he was going to... And the point is, you made them admit that Al Gore's movie
[52:51.800 --> 52:54.960]  was a fraud, so they stopped showing it in UK schools. You've done the scores of
[52:54.960 --> 52:58.200]  times. Let me ask you this then. By the way, I'll put it on screen if you didn't
[52:58.200 --> 53:00.480]  know, because it didn't get a lot of attention. The Supreme Court three months
[53:00.480 --> 53:04.280]  ago ruled him just ignoring laws, saying the border's wide open, and ordering
[53:04.280 --> 53:08.720]  them to ship illegals in, to God knows where, is illegal. He has continued. I
[53:08.720 --> 53:11.600]  could put the CNN on screen, Lord Boggs, and so you can see that.
[53:11.600 --> 53:16.760]  As I say, let me just finish this story, because when I told them that he'd
[53:16.760 --> 53:19.680]  have to resign, they backed off and said, okay, we won't ask for our costs. They
[53:19.680 --> 53:24.120]  knew he was acting against the law by demanding costs from me, and he couldn't
[53:24.120 --> 53:27.240]  get away with it, or he would have gone to prison. And it's the same with Mr.
[53:27.240 --> 53:32.040]  Obama. If the immigration decision of the Supreme Court is sufficiently
[53:32.040 --> 53:37.680]  clear, and if it is sufficiently clear that he is in breach of an order of the
[53:37.680 --> 53:41.840]  Supreme Court... And it says he's breaking the law....then all you have to do, if he
[53:41.840 --> 53:45.680]  continues to break the law, is to go back to the Supreme Court and say he's
[53:45.680 --> 53:52.360]  still doing it, and ask for them to order his arrest, and to be brought... Sure.
[53:52.360 --> 53:57.360]  I mean, to their credit, even though Scalia was dead, the split court still
[53:57.360 --> 54:03.240]  said Obama was wrong. So, I mean, it's very clear. So what you must now do is stop
[54:03.240 --> 54:09.160]  simply bloviating and start acting. You have to do what I did, take them to court,
[54:09.160 --> 54:13.400]  and it's really simple. The mechanism in this case is that if the Supreme Court
[54:13.400 --> 54:19.000]  has issued an order of which he is in breach, then all any citizen has to do
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.200]  is to go before that court, say, here is the evidence that he is in breach, and I
[54:24.200 --> 54:30.160]  want it stopped. And they are then obliged to order his arrest. They are
[54:30.160 --> 54:35.960]  obliged to order him to attend the court, obliged to give him his chance to have
[54:35.960 --> 54:40.280]  his say, and say why he thought it was appropriate to ignore an order of the
[54:40.280 --> 54:44.840]  Supreme Court. And if they are not satisfied with his explanation, and if he
[54:44.840 --> 54:50.040]  continues to refuse to back off, they can and should, and if you want my guess,
[54:50.040 --> 54:55.240]  will send him to jail. That's how you fight back against these people. Use
[54:55.240 --> 55:00.280]  their own mechanisms against them. I agree. Now, I guess I could go file it. I
[55:00.280 --> 55:05.000]  don't want to just bloviate here, but who should go file this? It should be us, what,
[55:05.000 --> 55:13.200]  a governor? Any citizen. Any citizen has the same right as any other citizen.
[55:13.200 --> 55:19.880]  When there is a breach of a court order as serious as this. Any citizen has the
[55:19.880 --> 55:23.560]  right. Okay, Lord Bolton, we're going to go to break in a moment, so just hold for
[55:23.560 --> 55:27.840]  just one moment, but first, I want to just add the listeners and viewers. We're
[55:27.840 --> 55:30.960]  an information war. It's very important to support the broadcast, spread the word.
[55:30.960 --> 55:36.240]  Internet censorship is kicking in. Don't take the show or scienceandpublicpolicy.org
[55:36.240 --> 55:41.640]  for granted. Spread those papers, those articles. We're in an info war. Show
[55:41.640 --> 55:46.680]  people the facts. Take advantage of our Hillary for Prison t-shirts at cost 9.95
[55:46.680 --> 55:53.400]  shipping included. That's at cost with shipping. 9.95. Biotrue selenium. Amazing

[56:18.400 --> 56:21.760]  that Hillary for Prison shirt because it's shaking the media. Okay, getting back
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.960]  to you, Lord Bolton. What else is on the table here? What other big events are
[56:26.960 --> 56:31.280]  happening? What else are we looking at that you're tracking? Right, here is a
[56:31.280 --> 56:37.000]  very interesting one on the 8th and 9th of September in London at the
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.280]  instigation of Professor Nicholas Merner, the world's greatest expert on sea level
[56:41.280 --> 56:45.360]  who, like all of us, believes that the global warming thing has been vastly
[56:45.360 --> 56:50.640]  exaggerated. There is the London Climate Change Conference starting at 9 o'clock
[56:50.640 --> 56:55.720]  in the morning on the 8th and 9th of September in Conway Hall, which is in
[56:55.720 --> 57:01.160]  London. Conway Hall, you can find it on the web very easily. Just turn up on the
[57:01.160 --> 57:06.040]  day and come into that conference. We have professors from all over the world
[57:06.040 --> 57:11.480]  leading doctors and professors of science and we will be looking at various
[57:11.480 --> 57:16.360]  scientific aspects of this climate change question. I will be chairing the
[57:16.360 --> 57:21.080]  open session of the conference. I'll be concluding the final session on the 9th,
[57:21.080 --> 57:25.240]  which is the second day of the conference, by making a major announcement
[57:25.240 --> 57:29.280]  about errors that have been identified in the computer models that have produced
[57:29.280 --> 57:34.560]  these wildly exaggerated predictions of global warming. These errors are serious
[57:34.560 --> 57:39.200]  and once the errors are exposed, that's the end of the scare. So make sure you
[57:39.200 --> 57:43.800]  make your way to that climate change conference in London at the Conway Hall
[57:43.800 --> 57:50.000]  and that is on the 8th and the 9th of September starting at 9 a.m. Very
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.840]  important you should do that. Absolutely. Let me ask you this question. It was
[57:53.840 --> 57:56.920]  hackers that brought up the high-the-declined stuff, the fact that it
[57:56.920 --> 58:00.800]  was all a big scam. It's multinationals, it's Americans, it's
[58:00.800 --> 58:05.680]  Brits, it's Russians, you name it. But aren't hackers really the secret weapon
[58:05.680 --> 58:08.760]  in all this? Because what do we have to fear? We're not doing anything wrong, but
[58:08.760 --> 58:13.040]  these criminals like Hillary, they've got to be really freaked out. They are
[58:13.040 --> 58:16.240]  running scared now and they're running particularly scared on this climate
[58:16.240 --> 58:20.760]  question because the scientific argument just continues to collapse as
[58:20.760 --> 58:25.120]  temperatures fail to rise at anything like the previously predicted rates.
[58:25.120 --> 58:29.920]  I've got to go to break. Do five more minutes with us and Nigel Farage is
[58:29.920 --> 58:32.600]  coming on. We're back in 70 seconds if you can, but I know it's nighttime over
[58:32.600 --> 58:36.160]  there. I'm gonna come back, have you finish up and then go to Nigel Farage, the
[58:36.160 --> 58:43.600]  former leader of Youth Kids. Stay with us. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit

[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:35.160]  years ago. I've had our own government come visit with me and I've met with them
[1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:39.840]  and I've had, you know, like police chiefs and stuff come in and they're just
[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:44.800]  like, you're not the only guy doing this, are you? Now you've got to have
[1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:49.880]  something else that's behind us and no, it's called resistance. It's called
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:54.120]  history. It's called will. It's called an incredible audience that aren't just
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:59.320]  spectators but are in the arena. The Patriots, you go to a Trump rally. I
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:03.200]  remember a race color creed. Go getters, not a piece of trash on the ground.
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:11.240]  Everybody polite, nice, smart, informed. You go look at a Hillary event. It looks
[1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:20.000]  like the living dead and just crazy people protesting and attacking, just
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:27.320]  all fighting with each other. It just shows what we're up against is easily
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:30.800]  defeated if we just decided to take action against it. There are a lot of
[1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:35.080]  folks smarter than I am and I built the Info War in 21 years and it's now
[1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:41.160]  changing the world because of you. Now, Julian Assange, very powerful interview
[1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:44.640]  he did with the New York Times where he just drops bombshell after bombshell.
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:47.080]  First he talks about demographics in Russia. Then he gets into Hillary. He
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:51.160]  wants to put the presses neck and a noose and that's the point I'm at. I mean
[1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:55.240]  everybody knows this. I mean that the creator of Dilbert endorsed Hillary
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:57.880]  because he was getting death threats. We have now entered this authoritarian
[1:01:57.880 --> 1:02:01.840]  crucible and I'm not backing down. Here is part of the Julian Assange most
[1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:08.520]  powerful interview yet. What we are drawing attention to is the amazing
[1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:14.960]  transformation of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party into being the
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:21.280]  National Security Party and the National Security Candidate by whipping up a
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:29.160]  neo-McCarthy hysteria about Russia. Any serious analyst understands that
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:35.040]  China and the United States are the only real games in town. China has ten times
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:41.960]  the population of Russia, seven times the GDP. Russia has the GDP of Italy. It's
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:45.600]  interesting in that it wants to be, you know, that it makes provocative
[1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:48.720]  statements and so on. It's interesting and of course within its own neck of the
[1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:57.160]  woods, countries in between Russia and China, Caucasus and so on, of course
[1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:02.280]  Russia is very significant to them. But on the world stage Russia is a bit player.
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:13.680]  Now that attempted reframing by Hillary Clinton to declare media
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:19.360]  organizations that are publishing material that shows illicit behavior in
[1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:28.840]  the DNC to fix the election for her as somehow us being Russian agents, similar
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:32.720]  criticism has emerged from people connected to her campaign to the
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:40.160]  intercept where Clinton-Greenwald works. Her campaign has effectively called and
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:45.520]  maybe even directly called Donald Trump, the opposition leader in this case, a
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:51.680]  Russian agent. Jill Stein, the Greens party candidate, effectively the fourth
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:03:57.640]  candidate in terms of numbers, has also been called a Russian agent. This is a
[1:03:57.640 --> 1:04:03.840]  neo-McCarthyus hysteria. What kind of press environment is this going to lead
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:11.800]  to post-election? The American press in the American liberal press in
[1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:18.200]  falling over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton are erecting a demon that is
[1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:22.440]  going to put nooses around everyone's necks as soon as she wins the election,
[1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:28.440]  which he is almost certainly going to do. You know people would ask me if I liked
[1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:31.920]  a son going back eight nine years ago and I said yeah I see no fault in him
[1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:36.320]  and they oh he's a you know left-wing blah blah and I said well we'll see when
[1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:41.080]  Democrats get in what he does and then if he goes after them when they're bad
[1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:47.200]  we know he's a hero. He is, he's a hero. That is pure veritas what you heard.
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:53.000]  The press climate. They are coming after the press like never before. This is the
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:57.640]  stuff that dictatorships and authoritarian regimes are made of. We're in
[1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:05.160]  danger. Joe Bigger with infowars.com. Matt Lauer will moderate the first forum
[1:05:05.160 --> 1:05:10.640]  between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Wednesday September 7th NBC News and
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:16.440]  MSNBC along with the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America will host the
[1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:21.000]  Commander-in-Chief Forum in New York City. It will be a one hour long forum
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.600]  where Clinton and Trump will answer questions about national security. The
[1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:30.520]  two candidates though will not be on stage at the same time but instead will
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:36.200]  go back to back. Once again Hillary Clinton is too scared to get on the same
[1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:41.720]  stage as Donald Trump. She's a coward. Where's Hillary? She's not in Louisiana.
[1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:46.760]  She's not in Mexico. She's not on the same stage as Donald Trump because she's
[1:05:46.760 --> 1:05:53.960]  sick. She's demented and she can't actually debate. She's scared. You can find

[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:16.200]  Music
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:20.520]  Live from Austin, Texas it's Alex Jones.
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:28.520]  Music
[1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:32.120]  But I'm here to remind you of who we are.
[1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:37.400]  We're the sons and daughters of abolitionists.
[1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:52.040]  Many women who gave their lives to fight against slavery but make no
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:58.680]  mistake about it. Slavery has returned and she is more vicious than ever
[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:14.200]  before because this time she is colorblind. 31% of white Americans
[1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:21.560]  are welfare recipients. 33% of black Americans have fallen for the same
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:27.560]  rules and 28% of Latino community has believed the lie that the
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:32.680]  government can take care of you from the cradle to the grave.
[1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:43.080]  All the while losing their humanity. So when Trump talks about
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:49.000]  the lies of the Democrat party has told
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  and the failed policies both in economics education and crime.
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:02.680]  Your heart should be stirred with passion and strength
[1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:06.040]  to do something about it.
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:12.120]  That is RW Bray and out of all the clips from the Austin event that we were
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:15.800]  obviously there covering that clip I thought last week was the most
[1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:20.760]  powerful and his words are true they're strong but it isn't even the
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:26.600]  eloquence it's the force behind it the way you delivered it was so
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:30.680]  heartfelt that I'm talking to folks that were there
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:34.360]  and my reporters they said that it really the the energy in the room was so
[1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:37.720]  strong during that and this declaration like basically like
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:40.120]  Moses saying we're going to come out of this thing and then I started just
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:43.720]  thinking back about being a republican family growing up and I never
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:46.840]  heard anything racist in fact I heard about bad things that people done how
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:50.040]  we had to build a free market economy to bring everybody up
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:55.560]  and then I would run into Democrats as I grew up and they would be so racist
[1:10:55.560 --> 1:10:59.720]  and I was like but the TV says it's the Democrats
[1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:03.880]  that are the anti-racist and it's just and it wasn't till I was like even 30
[1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:07.160]  I've been on the air years before I even started even figuring it out because
[1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:11.000]  the deception is so total I can't blame some of the Democrats and people that
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:15.080]  still buy into this because I'm pretty smart guy and and I was fooled so I
[1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:17.880]  now once you're awake you're like what's wrong with these idiots but but it's
[1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:20.840]  just people don't know history and those that don't know history at him to
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:24.280]  repeat it RW Bray I'm gonna go over his amazing military
[1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:28.760]  career and all the things he's he's done and he's the
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:31.560]  engagement director of the republican party of Texas
[1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:36.440]  I'm not gonna go over at all RW Bray.com Texas GOP.org and let's be clear I
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:39.160]  always want to be clear I'm not lionizing the republican party some
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:41.720]  a lot of horrible stuff and it's certainly been involved but that's
[1:11:41.720 --> 1:11:45.320]  different people but but the point is it's not the party that they've been
[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:48.120]  saying is now I've invited you here and I'm ranting you're over from Houston
[1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:50.360]  I want to get into this with you and I want to give you the floor the reason I'm
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:52.760]  so honored you just said you'd come in to see us
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:56.760]  so just on the phone is because I want to you know give folks not just five
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:59.800]  minutes of your speech but people to really let you take over if you want
[1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:04.040]  and kind of give us a sermon on your life your development what took you to
[1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:08.520]  this point because I think all of us are going through this process and but how
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:11.720]  do we accelerate that in others that have it thank you so much sir
[1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:16.200]  no thank you for having me really appreciate coming in so take over
[1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:20.360]  first let me tell you that um my wife adores you she's a new fan
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:23.480]  ever since um you all reached out she had never really saw it she started
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:27.320]  reaching out looking more at your clips and she she thinks that you're
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:31.080]  phenomenal well I'm I'm humble thank you thank you
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:34.920]  um I don't know I think the story kind of is very simple um the
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:39.240]  the speech actually was from from my heart I think that's the only way to be
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:44.040]  able to express from a black lens the importance of us
[1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:48.840]  adopting republicanism and for me I'm actually a
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:53.720]  a Louisiana originally consider myself a person who
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:57.880]  I evacuated from from Katrina I was in a guard at the time so I
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:02.200]  actually evacuated I had to run back actually I was called up to to serve
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:06.280]  um I was given the the order to to find
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:09.560]  10 families in Houston who had evacuated with me
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:13.480]  um and bring them back even though I was in Baton Rouge so I
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:19.400]  actually had to drive to Houston find 10 families bring them back
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:23.080]  um to Baton Rouge and then take the the mothers and the
[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:26.680]  and the and the husbands who were actually guard members to serve
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:31.240]  so I did um a month in search and rescue and three months of ICU
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:34.360]  and that's where my conversion starts unfortunately I didn't have the benefit
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:38.200]  of being raised in a republican family I was raised a democrat
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:42.040]  see I didn't know your story but I think for all of us it's humanizing it
[1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:44.840]  how you get to the point of this powerful speech that goes worldwide and
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:47.960]  wakes up so many people I just I just knew it would be very interesting
[1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:52.120]  yes it's uh it's a story in and of itself but I'll give you a
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:56.440]  fast version of it uh I um I was taking a Black Hawk trip
[1:13:56.440 --> 1:14:00.520]  and as I was taking the Black Hawk trip we were actually looking for movement
[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:03.080]  that was our goal we had to look for in your life
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:06.840]  um it was devastating and just devastation upon devastation I remember
[1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:10.840]  looking at um the the east side of New Orleans
[1:14:10.840 --> 1:14:14.200]  and it was all gray Alex everything was gray
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:17.800]  so we gave up looking for life and and and so we circled back around
[1:14:17.800 --> 1:14:20.920]  right in gray water just gray water gray houses you know
[1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:25.240]  no heat and the flare nothing nothing was going on and and so
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:30.200]  uh we got to the to the river walk and I saw the pilot
[1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:34.280]  starting to cry and I look down and it's nothing but
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:37.400]  many women who look just like me and that's what I knew
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:41.240]  we had believed though a lie but the government cannot take care of you
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:45.480]  it was droves of African Americans with their hands up in America
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:48.120]  looking for something to be dropped down I don't know the story but let me guess
[1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:52.200]  what color was the pilot white and my whole point is is that we're just all
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:55.320]  human beings that's right and the way they play on this and then even when the
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:00.280]  military goes out you know Obama said well a few weeks ago about
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:04.200]  Louisiana again he said be sure don't be racist uh
[1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:07.400]  teams that are going in there I have family that was there as well
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:10.120]  uh who was active duty army but they actually brought them in on that with
[1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:12.840]  the helicopters and they were there working 18 hours a day oh yeah getting
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:16.200]  I had family get really hurt there and I tell you it really pisses them off when
[1:15:16.200 --> 1:15:18.600]  they're not when they care about everybody yes and they're being told
[1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:21.480]  they're racist even as they're saving people so I mean
[1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:24.280]  what I get from that is don't want to put words in your mouth are are you saying
[1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:27.480]  that was another big moment for you to see that yes that was a shocking moment
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:31.320]  for me and the the amazing thing is that we circled
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:34.520]  back around to the east side later on that day because
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:37.960]  we had to only you had to do footwork as well as air so we went through
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:41.160]  through the homes you know making the the marks on the on the on the walls and
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:44.920]  whatnot and in the rubbish of a of a house I found a book called Up from
[1:15:44.920 --> 1:15:49.080]  Slavery by Booker T Washington and so I took that
[1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:53.400]  book washed it off and I had a small little tent where
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:57.800]  our area was and I at night I would read that book
[1:15:57.800 --> 1:16:01.160]  and it changed my life Booker T Washington
[1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:05.080]  was a entrepreneur he was an educated
[1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:09.240]  advocate he started his his own university it would be no
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:12.040]  Tuskegee Airmen if it wasn't for for this guy it would be no
[1:16:12.040 --> 1:16:16.520]  Tuskegee University it wasn't for this guy but I saw his story
[1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:21.160]  literally from he went from dirt floors to marble
[1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:23.960]  and he gave one of the most powerful speeches the Atlanta Compromise I had
[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:26.920]  ever heard of in my life and by the way I know this history folks
[1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:29.560]  that don't and I'm not defending segregation it's horrible but it was
[1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:33.560]  we replaced one evil than other he was his model and system
[1:16:33.560 --> 1:16:36.440]  that made black communities many areas wealthier in the white areas which
[1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:40.040]  created the institutional racism even more and and they
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:44.280]  started pushing massive class warfare between poor whites
[1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:47.640]  and poor blacks and that's when lbj and all them came in
[1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:50.360]  with we're gonna get the men out of the house we're gonna break these
[1:16:50.360 --> 1:16:53.320]  communities down because blacks just said okay you're gonna suppress us
[1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:56.680]  we're crater on community that's right and and so they got rid of it I didn't
[1:16:56.680 --> 1:16:59.080]  even know this you knew all this because almost no one knows this I'm trying
[1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:03.160]  to explain to people wow that's amazing yeah so so if if
[1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:07.160]  Americans period would do it Booker T Washington will explain to people then
[1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:10.360]  yeah so Booker T Washington like I said advocate for education
[1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:14.840]  um he could not get the what I would call racist whites to
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:18.600]  invest at all into his do it yourself so he did it himself and he went out he
[1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:21.320]  and he got investors from republican investors
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:24.280]  which is exactly what I'm I'm advocating now
[1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:27.480]  um I don't I don't like for us to go around making excuses but they in the
[1:17:27.480 --> 1:17:32.040]  racist the the republican part of it found in the KKK
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:35.000]  oh it's a democrats I'm sorry yeah yeah I forgot about that those are the
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.600]  democrats and it's amazing you I love the fact
[1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:41.960]  that you're you're knowledgeable of this history and I tried to give a brief
[1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:45.560]  history um at the at the at the Trump rally
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:48.520]  and you know my family in Texas on my dad's side were republicans and went
[1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:51.480]  through a lot of crap over well I never told the stories on areas
[1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:54.840]  over the top but imagine these taxes being republicans in the 40s and 50s
[1:17:54.840 --> 1:17:57.720]  and 60s it was not a very I can only imagine
[1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:01.480]  yeah I'm only man I'm a racist
[1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:04.680]  yeah we why you having me on the show exactly no but I mean it just shows how
[1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:07.080]  those that don't know history didn't repeat it the public period doesn't know
[1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:11.160]  history no please continue the story um and that was my conversion between
[1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:15.240]  that experience Katrina obviously in the book seeing a black man
[1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:18.840]  who had no poly it was unapologetic for being a republican changed my entire
[1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:22.120]  life and my whole view of how I needed to advance my life
[1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:26.040]  it was then I realized I need to start getting active and ushered in why I'm
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:29.400]  now an advocate for the republican party of Texas I'm a proud advocate
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:34.200]  um I would not have I not made changes then and and change my idea of what
[1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:37.240]  success was what knowledge was with education was and how to
[1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:40.600]  run my political life I would have never had the opportunity to be able to give
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:44.520]  a speech at the Trump rally to ignite fire and millions of people but
[1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:47.720]  more importantly um I'm on the show that touches millions
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:50.920]  because of you and we have a common we have a common heart
[1:18:50.920 --> 1:18:54.360]  well that's what Trump does is whether it's myself or you he gives a voice to
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:18:56.840]  other people that have important information
[1:18:56.840 --> 1:19:01.240]  and then he's helping magnify a whole new group of people that's right to
[1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:04.360]  truly create real diversity of ideas and thought that's right really not have
[1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:07.000]  teleprompters but come together that's just get real
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:10.600]  because our country's in trouble oh yeah and you have the energy of John Brown
[1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:15.240]  I love it because I'm not sure if the your listeners know who John Brown is but
[1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:17.400]  John Brown was good friends with Frederick Douglass
[1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:20.440]  um he's a powerful abolitionist powerful advocate
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:25.080]  um who wanted to basically enslave at all costs to the point he got militia to
[1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:27.880]  do it he was gonna overtake the entire government yeah
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:31.080]  but he wanted to white white races wanted to hang in this guy for even
[1:19:31.080 --> 1:19:34.680]  you know even trying to do this but I think I'll play the god they never
[1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:37.560]  hang you but I but I think the fire that you have
[1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:40.600]  is reminiscent of those days and I think that's what's coming I think there's
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:44.600]  going to be a second reconstruction and I think it's going to happen to people
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:48.680]  who get galvanized and ignite a fire underneath their bellies to start doing
[1:19:48.680 --> 1:19:51.080]  something yeah the Democrats are playing total race
[1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:54.280]  card you want to write back to their KKK roots I mean I'm not just demonizing
[1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:57.240]  them they deserve it I mean Julian Assange is a real liberal he says Hillary

[1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:20.760]  family in east Texas which is basically Louisiana and we were we were talking
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:24.360]  earlier about wild stuff that we even told people they wouldn't
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:26.440]  believe it unless you've lived in the south
[1:24:26.440 --> 1:24:31.000]  um about the democratic party and just if all the stupid liberals knew what we
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.680]  knew uh this is only a six minute segment long
[1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:37.080]  segment coming up we'll give out the number and take calls
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:39.880]  let's get into those brush fires you've been setting
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:44.360]  uh with the trump campaign and preach if you want take over
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:48.120]  yes um we've been um we've been tearing them up Alex
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:53.960]  uh we we spent a lot of time in Texas uh dispelling the myths and and lifting
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:55.880]  the veil one of the things that we've done is
[1:24:55.880 --> 1:24:59.640]  you know we republican parties kind of tried to take an approach where
[1:24:59.640 --> 1:25:03.640]  they would do outreach we changed that we changed the the the language of
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:07.400]  outreach to engagement and we figured the democrat party is going to
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:11.000]  integrate themselves into our communities then the republican party's
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:14.200]  going to integrate themselves back into the black community and that's exactly
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:17.000]  what we did and so we teamed up and collaborated with different
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:20.040]  organizations from black chamber of commerce's
[1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:25.000]  who are pushing uh entrepreneurial programs to uh to IP which is a uh a
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:28.600]  faith-based program it's all about taking underprivileged men and women
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:31.960]  in the three to four and the fifth wars of houston which is predominantly black
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:35.160]  and lifting them up giving them jobs economically independent
[1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:38.280]  hooking them up with their civic presidents to become civically involved
[1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:41.080]  and teaching them the importance of integrity and standing up as men so
[1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:45.320]  they don't return back to the prisons so we're actually in the communities that
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:49.320]  we once were trying to preach from afar we're out in the streets preaching and
[1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:52.840]  I think it's changing the the rhetoric and the
[1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:56.360]  language of what people think of republicanism so we actively
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:26:00.760]  are rebranding republicanism is it right to say
[1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:04.040]  that the black community after eight years of neglect from obama
[1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:07.800]  unemployment rate almost doubling for black americans that that they're
[1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:10.760]  ready for the wake-up call because that's what we see in the streets but then i
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:13.560]  see the news you know spinning it that that that
[1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:16.120]  african americans don't like trump but the numbers even show that
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:19.320]  record numbers do you're absolutely right i cannot tell you how many phone
[1:26:19.320 --> 1:26:22.920]  calls i've received since that speech people have found my number somehow
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:27.160]  and they have they are emailing they are texting they are they are calling me on
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:31.000]  facebook sending messages and most of these individuals are blacks
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:34.440]  and these are african americans who are sick of the system you have
[1:26:34.440 --> 1:26:38.200]  you have so so many gays at the new black number one
[1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:41.480]  and that's something that i get across a lot they will say hey we
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:44.920]  we don't have anything against the lesbian community or the gay community
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:48.600]  but we don't think it's the same plight so what do we need to do
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:52.840]  you're in the party that is not going to preach that BLM just received over a
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:26:55.560]  hundred uh i think it was a hundred million
[1:26:55.560 --> 1:26:59.080]  from ford and so they're going to try and push a hundred million
[1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:02.680]  to to press um black lives matter and one of the
[1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:06.120]  things on their initiatives that are have nothing to do with black lives
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:08.920]  black black black lives has nothing to do with uh
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:14.040]  is creating victimology with a string so they can make her by dance their puppet
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:17.160]  strings where you're a victim we're the people you trust
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:20.120]  by the way we're going to double your unemployment oh yeah at the same time i
[1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:22.920]  mean that's all they're doing that they're just creating the identity isn't
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:26.440]  who you are individually are going out and and you know doing all these great
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:29.000]  innovations and that's what i go back to what happened with
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:32.200]  it's not that the oppression was good but that which doesn't kill you only makes
[1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:35.320]  you stronger people say what are you doing endorsing you know slavery or
[1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:39.160]  segregation no no no my point is like special forces you know people
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:43.160]  being pressured to get better it made people innovate where so many of the
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:47.320]  famous inventions uh were created by people with no
[1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:51.080]  education that were african because they absolutely had to to survive that's
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:54.360]  right and then you see quote government free handouts creating devastation
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:57.400]  that's right and liberals have a way of seriously doing that i mean you think
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:02.840]  about it the top the top democrat states in america are led by white liberals
[1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:06.440]  there's only you take the top 12 states that are typically vote on blue
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:11.640]  there's only one black democrat so basically yeah we want you 94 vote
[1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:16.600]  but you can't lead our party the dnc 94 african americans are voting voting
[1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:20.440]  black but the dnc is a white liberal and so that's just like the plantation
[1:28:20.440 --> 1:28:24.840]  mindset they want they know how to set the crops up to harvest later
[1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:28.760]  and for them the blacks are the slaves that offer them the vote they need to
[1:28:28.760 --> 1:28:31.240]  stay in office well i'll say this because they're going to screw over the
[1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:35.080]  hispanics as well they want cheap labor and a new you know permanent underclass
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:38.040]  but right now they're going oh my god blacks are waking up
[1:28:38.040 --> 1:28:41.880]  that's right switch over to hispanics and that's why you've seen such a total
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:45.560]  total abandonment that's right and the sad thing is that african americans in
[1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:49.320]  those areas don't see the importance and the power of their vote
[1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:52.360]  no one party should have a monopoly over the black vote
[1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:56.360]  people want it they need to earn it and and the african americans have given
[1:28:56.360 --> 1:28:59.000]  their vote over to democrats and they've lost their power let's talk about
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:03.240]  trump we're going to break in a minute but uh what's your like in person
[1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:06.440]  meaning what's your impression he's just like you
[1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:10.280]  truly he's the guy who says we things to give it to you straight no chaser
[1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:13.480]  you gotta appreciate me the man like that doesn't matter you know we we've
[1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:17.400]  gone to this pc world where you can't say anything that's really on your mind
[1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:20.840]  well that's not that's not that's not the way that's right things moving
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:24.600]  but while they claim that you know we want to get rid of this establishment
[1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:27.080]  and then congress has a nine percent approval rating the media has a six
[1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:31.640]  percent and then here's the whole thing we hate the whole system that
[1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:35.560]  we say we don't want is having conniption fits over donald trump
[1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:40.120]  people are insane if they don't i mean it's like he said
[1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:43.640]  what do you have to lose you're getting screwed over i'm gonna
[1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:48.680]  make better deals guaranteed it's guaranteed we'll be right back
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:52.520]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:52.520 --> 1:29:59.320]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:59.320 --> 1:30:03.640]  joe bigs here with info wars dot com colin cappernick says the pigs on his
[1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:06.760]  socks were only meant to represent row cops
[1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:10.440]  colin cappernick made more news thursday when photos of him wearing socks
[1:30:10.440 --> 1:30:14.520]  with pictures of pigs dressed like police officers began attracting
[1:30:14.520 --> 1:30:18.440]  attention this is the same guy who refused to stay enough during the
[1:30:18.440 --> 1:30:21.480]  national anthem the san francisco 49ers quarterback
[1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:25.160]  addressed the situation with an instagram post later in the morning i
[1:30:25.160 --> 1:30:28.280]  wore these socks in the past because the row cops that are allowed to hold
[1:30:28.280 --> 1:30:31.880]  positions in police departments not only put the community in danger but also
[1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:35.160]  put the cops that have the right intentions in danger by creating an
[1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:39.000]  environment of tension and mistrust he added that he wore the socks before
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:42.680]  he started sitting down during the national anthem prior to the 49ers
[1:30:42.680 --> 1:30:45.640]  pre-season games this year there is police brutality the
[1:30:45.640 --> 1:30:49.320]  quarterback said people of color have been targeted by police so that's a large
[1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:52.840]  part of it and their government officials they are put in place by the
[1:30:52.840 --> 1:30:56.200]  government so that's something that this country has to change you can find
[1:30:56.200 --> 1:30:59.240]  more reports like this at info wars dot com

[1:33:49.880 --> 1:33:53.320]  that we just came out with it's from the mustard seed the best bioavailable form
[1:33:53.320 --> 1:33:56.680]  out there it's using all electrochemical activity in the body
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:00.680]  to get all the toxins out of the cells you name it you die without it people are
[1:34:00.680 --> 1:34:04.760]  massively massive i'm gonna take some right now massively
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:09.080]  um not getting enough selenium out there do your own research look into
[1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:13.640]  what selenium does cancer rates you name it it is
[1:34:13.640 --> 1:34:16.600]  it is truly a game changer and it fuses with iodine
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:20.120]  but nobody's got the proper type of iodine we have the only true
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:24.760]  nascent iodine from our research that's out there it's from a deep earth source
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:29.720]  not from seaweed the stuff we have would eat through three layers of steel
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:33.080]  building like in the movie alien i mean that's how
[1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:36.760]  powerful that the good halogen is but then through a special
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:39.880]  patented russian technique i guess we are now russian agents i think i guess
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:43.880]  that's a russian connection the media's got it um it is then injected into
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:47.800]  organic palm oil and then there's no longer uh stuff that leads through
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:50.840]  steel girders and i'm just documenting for you how
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:54.600]  powerful this halogen is it's in the same family as fluoride
[1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:59.640]  chlorine all the garbage that just inundates our environment and you take
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:03.720]  selenium you take this you take enough vitamin c we don't sell that there's
[1:35:03.720 --> 1:35:05.800]  so many good sources of it out there naturally
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:09.880]  they all work in synergy but if you don't have one of these you die
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:15.640]  and deficiencies in it are just record level record level your cells don't have
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:18.520]  this they start malfunctioning they start mutating we
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:24.040]  there's a name for that info wars lives dot com info wars store dot com

[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:36.600]  family just like our mythical boleman secret twelve is
[1:36:36.600 --> 1:36:40.120]  nutraceutical grade you know pharmacy grade vitamin b12 is the same stuff
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:42.760]  people inject don't inject this it's for under the
[1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:45.000]  tongue you want to inject it it's even more absorbable
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.840]  go get it from a doctor but but but but minus that and let me tell you
[1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:52.600]  injectable from a doctor is like way up here our stuff's down here but
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:55.880]  everything else is way down here i mean you don't absorb basically any
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:58.760]  of the synthetic trash that's out there put it under your tongue hold it for a
[1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:01.960]  minute you're gonna get closer to an injection
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:05.560]  not as good i'm just gonna be honest with you but it is a game
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:09.320]  changer i sit around with top scientists developers
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:13.240]  chemists and i say what are game changers missing links there's a ton
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.800]  of them because most nutraceutical companies will put
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:19.320]  ten dollars into marketing two dollars into what's in it and then sell it for
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:22.920]  a hundred bucks we don't do that we have a hundred percent markup
[1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:26.680]  on average the average is seven times the markup
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:29.960]  no i'm going to put quality in the bottle do a hundred percent markup
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:33.640]  funder operation have all the all the big
[1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:37.240]  health sites go crazy over what we're doing dominate the market and have all
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:39.720]  these people buying our products that aren't even listeners now that we're
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:41.960]  getting a lot of listeners from people getting the products because they're
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:45.160]  that good i went out and found the top three developers
[1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:49.560]  of nutraceuticals in the country and i did deals with all three of them
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:53.080]  the group's just one of them the others are too scared to come on here from big
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:55.480]  companies even bigger than group i mean some of these
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:58.360]  companies are supplying like a third of the stuff at Whole Foods just so you know
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:01.880]  and so that's why our stuff is so good and plus it's got to be bulletproof
[1:38:01.880 --> 1:38:05.000]  with the government coming after it's how they harass supplement makers
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:08.600]  i want to be great quality for everybody i want you to come back i want you to get
[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:13.560]  a good deal i i want to be treated like i treat other people
[1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:17.240]  it's like revolutionary no that's what built america folks all i'm doing is
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:20.040]  just like he did going back and reading history books
[1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:23.880]  by people that actually built this country like book or tea washington and
[1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:27.960]  others it goes on and on and on and the innovation of
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:33.480]  hybrid crops in modern developments came from people that were oppressed in
[1:38:33.480 --> 1:38:37.800]  this country black americans and again i'm not pushing oppression
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:41.960]  the point is open oppression makes you stronger you should smash it
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:44.840]  but what we're being killed by is all this large s how easy everything's
[1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:47.720]  gotten and they're not being aware now i want to take phone calls
[1:38:47.720 --> 1:38:55.320]  800-2599-231-800-2599-231 rwbrae rwbrae.com
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:59.400]  he is the black engagement director of the republican party of texas
[1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:03.720]  he's a military veteran and a patriot and we appreciate him being he's currently
[1:39:03.720 --> 1:39:07.560]  a master sergeant serving his first sergeant guardsman and proud veterans
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:11.400]  advocate in houston texas and a lot of other community stuff for children you
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:15.560]  name it the mlk association vice chair of texas i'm gonna stop right there
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:19.480]  that's another thing mlk a republican he goes on and on but but but but give us
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:23.000]  your greatest hits i mean you know i mean what what what's really powerful
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:27.880]  what folks need to know sir um and and what trump needs to do to win
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:32.680]  what we need to do to win strategically i think trump needs to make sure that he
[1:39:32.680 --> 1:39:36.840]  he has advocates and surrogates in in in north carolina
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:41.640]  uh wisconsin pa uh michigan reason why is because
[1:39:41.640 --> 1:39:45.320]  number one that's the rust belt number two places like ohio
[1:39:45.320 --> 1:39:48.680]  we have a significant black population who are waiting
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:53.240]  for an answer yet their their neighborhoods are being torn apart
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:56.760]  by bitter rivalries whether that's through gangs
[1:39:56.760 --> 1:39:59.880]  or whether that's just a simple fact that people are living in poverty or fed
[1:39:59.880 --> 1:40:02.920]  up and they are overreacting and reacting by killing their own
[1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:06.520]  that is the consequence of the democrat league think about this acts
[1:40:06.520 --> 1:40:11.480]  50 council members in chicago 49 of which are democrat
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:15.960]  one republican and you look across the nation wherever there's democrats
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:20.440]  in lead in leadership leadership there is a failing municipality
[1:40:20.440 --> 1:40:23.960]  and that's because there are some ideologies this is satanic
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:27.160]  i would agree sorry i agree but there are some ideologies that work
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:30.280]  and there's some that don't the thing about republican ideologies that they
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:34.120]  are timeless traditional they've always worked they always will provide
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:37.880]  it we remember in the fact that matter of fact there is that humans often
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:42.200]  have a bad habit of losing memory i agree those don't know history
[1:40:42.200 --> 1:40:46.440]  don't repeat the place continue yeah well one of the ways that we're jabbing
[1:40:46.440 --> 1:40:49.960]  at this thing and i i got to i got to say this i really love your hillary
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:53.400]  shirt um i have a good friend of mine called maniola came into the trump
[1:40:53.400 --> 1:40:56.360]  battle with me almost got kicked out because they they didn't read the thing
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:41:00.600]  but when they finally know it's a great conversation starter exactly yeah
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:03.800]  yeah they finally read it and it allows them to come in but um
[1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:10.280]  but i i think that agitating the current status quo um like you're sure
[1:41:10.280 --> 1:41:13.560]  that agitates people we need to continue to agitate people verbally though and
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:16.120]  that's the problem they're on a block they don't enough black
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:20.200]  surrogates if trump trump wants to make a make a dent well exactly with the
[1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:23.560]  fact that shows us sophisticated york is i i barely even realized that when i
[1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:26.200]  did it i just i always have the idea and then i see the thinking behind it
[1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:30.120]  letters like my brain just knows i wanted it to cause debates that's right
[1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:33.240]  cause discussions that's right and say hillary for prison
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:36.440]  that's our campaign yes and then it's really caught on but please continue
[1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:38.200]  well that's what frederick douglas stood for
[1:41:38.200 --> 1:41:41.800]  frederick douglas the very first father of civil rights movement stood for three
[1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:45.880]  things he's the number one if he's done stuff for economic independence
[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:49.160]  number two social collaborate social and business collaboration
[1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:53.800]  collaboration and number three freckles frederick douglas on screen that guy
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:56.440]  he'd be a movie star today and that guy just looks so cool
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:42:02.920]  yes yes and number three his last one was agitation agitation one of the last
[1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:07.560]  things that he said in in his last speech a young black man at a university
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:11.720]  asked him as a young black man what should i be doing he says agitate
[1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:15.560]  agitate agitate and what i see in info wars i see in people like
[1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:19.320]  trump yourself and others that i come across the nation is that we are ready
[1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:22.520]  political agitation has moved the needle now what you're saying is we're not
[1:42:22.520 --> 1:42:25.960]  trying to play in the corrupt system we're changing it we're not trying to
[1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:29.880]  play by their rules and go along with it we're we're we're expanding the entire
[1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:32.680]  paradigm that's right and what better place to start than texas
[1:42:32.680 --> 1:42:36.040]  the rpt is doing in powerful things are going to areas that know the state is
[1:42:36.040 --> 1:42:38.680]  going we're getting calls that know the state is calling
[1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:41.480]  and when you think about that they rewrote ron paul's district over and
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:45.080]  over again they kept rewriting it for democrats in black areas
[1:42:45.080 --> 1:42:49.080]  thinking and then he won by even bigger landslides that's right that's right
[1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:53.000]  because he people go meeting he's just a sweet loving doctor that had been like
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:56.040]  you know volunteering three days a week for decades
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:43:00.360]  yes at poor hospitals that's right and this is a guy who literally like would
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:04.040]  volunteer two three days a week at poor hospitals that's right because he but
[1:43:04.040 --> 1:43:06.520]  for for no money that's right because he believed that
[1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:09.400]  and of course he's racist ron paul though well well most people believe that
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:12.600]  common sense isn't common these days but the truth is that is it is
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:15.880]  people know common sense when they see it they see earnestness they see a man
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:19.320]  with a with the correct heart they see a one person who has passion and they
[1:43:19.320 --> 1:43:23.720]  will gravitate toward it if trump continues to make sure that he goes
[1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:26.760]  into these black neighborhoods regardless of whatever the media is
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:30.440]  saying continue to go because i'm in those black neighborhoods he's been doing it
[1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:34.120]  yeah and they like it they like the fact that finally someone is coming into
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:36.920]  those neighborhoods and talking and that's how we're going to meanwhile
[1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:42.680]  obama vacations like a hundred days a year it
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:45.960]  doesn't even care about louisiana and gets away with it i mean i'm not
[1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:49.400]  defending bush he had some problems big time but he okay some problems with
[1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:52.280]  contrari response he responded they don't even show up
[1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:57.560]  hillary doesn't even care it's like well i had a i had a show on lifting
[1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:01.160]  novell until the liberals got mad uh it was in it was in houston and they
[1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:04.280]  killed this show it was called lifting the veil off of bookity washington
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:07.640]  wasn't on the radio already they kill shows oh yeah
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:09.720]  we get knocked off all the time they'll come and say
[1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:13.320]  three hundred thousand dollars take him off yeah yeah they're good at it but one
[1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:17.560]  thing that one thing that really i touched on was that if obama really
[1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:20.680]  really care for african-americans or the current administration period
[1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:24.840]  we had one opportunity to get a supreme court just and
[1:44:24.840 --> 1:44:28.280]  latino was appointed we had another one and the lgbt was appointed
[1:44:28.280 --> 1:44:31.960]  his even his third choice that he tried to come was not a black person
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:34.280]  so a lot of people in the black neighborhoods are starting to see that
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:37.960]  this guy never was going to make our lives better and the truth is that you
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:40.200]  can't depend on the government to make your life better
[1:44:40.200 --> 1:44:43.640]  only you can do that plus to use the analogy
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:46.680]  and it's being pimped you already got you i don't need to you know yeah that's
[1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:50.440]  that i mean hey boom it's it's a given it's about
[1:44:50.440 --> 1:44:55.320]  time that we start listening to our ancestors um x talked about not trusting
[1:44:55.320 --> 1:44:58.520]  liberals one of the greatest quotes they ever said was keep in mind that a
[1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:01.560]  dixie crowd is nothing more than a democrat in disguise
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:05.720]  he talked about the fact that one party um we had been invested in
[1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:08.680]  has abandoned us there was a racist from the beginning and it will always be
[1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:12.280]  racist mlk warned us of the uh the of not looking
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:14.920]  judging men by his color in nice content you got blacks who won't join the
[1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:17.560]  public and party simply because there's a lot a lot of white people in it and
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:21.240]  let's explain it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy
[1:45:21.240 --> 1:45:24.680]  where they say the tea party's racist and so then
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:27.720]  minorities who are majority in this area don't go
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:30.680]  and what the real racism is the media pushing that but then what's happening
[1:45:30.680 --> 1:45:34.200]  on the trump phenomenon i want you to speak to this because it's documented
[1:45:34.200 --> 1:45:37.560]  black americans hispanic americans others are going and they're absolutely being
[1:45:37.560 --> 1:45:41.080]  appreciated by everybody and they're like wow this is incredible and people are
[1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:44.440]  coming together it's very cathartic i see people crying that's right i mean
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:47.560]  this is crazy so again they they create the perception
[1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:51.640]  which makes it the reality oh yeah we have modern day abolitionists right now
[1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:55.560]  people who brave people of different colors going to those neighborhoods
[1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:58.600]  saying come with me to this come with me to see hillary's america
[1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:01.800]  come with me to watch this and and they're learning that there was a there was a
[1:46:01.800 --> 1:46:05.400]  black woman who was at the trump rally who was brought by two white friends and
[1:46:05.400 --> 1:46:08.600]  she was right up front i thought that was amazing so there there are modern day
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:11.880]  abolitionists but more importantly i believe this is the rebirth of a second
[1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:15.480]  reconstruction we the boys even said that he wished that the
[1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:19.320]  reconstruction had last reconstruction had finished its mark it never finished
[1:46:19.320 --> 1:46:23.000]  what it was supposed to do now it has an opportunity to do that republicans
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:25.800]  need to wake up and know that hijack by a lot of corruption when lincoln got
[1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:29.400]  killed well obviously yeah you you cut off the the head of the snake right
[1:46:29.400 --> 1:46:33.240]  yeah all i know is i don't know how trump it's playing for being on the kkk
[1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:38.280]  when 20 years ago and 10 years ago he by himself he decried david duke
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:41.880]  and and then meanwhile hillary's like kissing all over robert bird that you
[1:46:41.880 --> 1:46:46.920]  know the kkk wizard i mean it's just you can't make this up i mean it's just
[1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:50.440]  no and i think another thing is just to add something to it the black community
[1:46:50.440 --> 1:46:53.560]  is finally woke up to a margaret sanger in her lies
[1:46:53.560 --> 1:46:58.360]  you know we we we have a population that is declining in the black neighborhood
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:01.240]  when you consider a hundred hundred and twenty years ago
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:05.000]  black population made of 30 we're at 12 to 13 percent now so over a century and
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:09.240]  a half we only make a 13 oh i know that's the fundamental where i'm told
[1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:12.680]  you're racist because you don't want black lives matter and george soros
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:15.080]  trying to turn black people into racists show that
[1:47:15.080 --> 1:47:17.880]  like there was a big study out last week i meant to cover i didn't get into it
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:21.320]  major university study can you just pull it up diversity programs
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:25.240]  actually make things less diverse and hurt minority communities absolutely
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:29.640]  yes you turn hispanics and black people into basically kkk versions for
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:34.760]  minority groups hopping up and down truly real progressive business owners
[1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:36.520]  don't care what color they are don't want trouble
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:39.560]  and they're just all of a sudden they're not racist they're scared
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:42.520]  and people are look like chips i mean the worst thing about spoiled kids and
[1:47:42.520 --> 1:47:45.640]  then we've all got them you know nowadays in the society is that they
[1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:48.040]  always think there's a chip on their shoulder and you did something to them
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:50.920]  and that's part of maturity is getting past having a chip on your shoulder
[1:47:50.920 --> 1:47:54.760]  and they're just trying to install chips on people's shoulders yes like it's a
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:58.520]  degree or something yes when all of this is an anchor around your neck
[1:47:58.520 --> 1:48:03.000]  and speaking of anchors the uh the anchor institutions black anchor
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.120]  institutions like n double acp are now fighting against charter schools and
[1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:09.080]  academies um p-ditty actually just created a charter
[1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:12.440]  school in new york the n double acp is going to be trying to fight to kill it
[1:48:12.440 --> 1:48:16.040]  oh nationwide it is now a mandated and good for p-ditty
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:19.400]  yeah i'm gonna help people to want to get out of this hell thing exactly
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:23.240]  exactly and and if they don't know how to teach our children then why not get a
[1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:26.280]  retired superintendent retired teachers in the area
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:29.880]  and create a charter school and teach those kids in a way that the liberal
[1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:34.200]  whites are failing why is that bad the truth is that the party
[1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:38.040]  the democratic party wants to corral african-americans and minorities into
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:41.320]  one area so they can control them absolutely i want to go to

[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:45.480]  assigns is just like this is like totalitarianism this is the unified bs
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:49.560]  really shameful quite frankly and frightening uh tony go ahead
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:53.400]  hey thank you alex been a long listener um it's about
[1:49:53.400 --> 1:49:58.920]  it's about 2009 and you know back since 9 11 i started to realize that something
[1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:02.840]  wasn't right so i've seen the documentary what was it called uh
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:07.880]  blue change and i started to see things and as i worked in the news
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:11.880]  you know i just felt like a lot of these stories weren't even both sides so as i
[1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:16.680]  became producer on a weekend newscast and the anchor
[1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:20.280]  you know i started adding little bits to the story and giving my sources and then
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:23.560]  we had high ratings i mean it was incredible to the point where they didn't
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:26.840]  know why so the viewers started emailing in and
[1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:30.280]  then they were like you know he's got this information so i get
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:34.600]  called in in the office and they say hey uh you need to stop putting this stuff
[1:50:34.600 --> 1:50:39.720]  into the stories because uh you know it's not approved by nbc and i'm like
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:42.840]  well it's you know we have to share both sides of
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:46.840]  this story so i think it's good journalism it's in that what we study
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:49.880]  they're like no no no it's coming from nbc you just put it in the way it
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:54.360]  is don't change it and i said okay i said uh but
[1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.920]  you know we're gonna lose ratings i mean you need to look at that i mean people
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:51:01.560]  love this information look you're just being told don't do it
[1:51:01.560 --> 1:51:04.360]  all right absolutely absolutely i mean i want to hear the rest of your story but
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:08.280]  for folks that don't know local so-called news and and i want to
[1:51:08.280 --> 1:51:10.040]  change this while we're launching a tv system
[1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:12.680]  not been so busy fighting other fights haven't quite got that launch yet but
[1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:16.120]  but it's happening folks and then always you know good times seems to be in god's
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:19.080]  plan but everybody should just put out their own
[1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:21.560]  news it's inexpensive now to do it compared to what it was
[1:51:21.560 --> 1:51:26.120]  so that stations u hf v h f cable have a choice
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:29.240]  and don't just spew because it comes down in talking points
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:32.920]  they load the teleprompter it looks like your local trusted news person that's
[1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:36.920]  more trusted than national let's say 50 trusted local versus six
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:39.400]  percent national but really your local person is
[1:51:39.400 --> 1:51:42.200]  really a national repeater and so you're you're you're
[1:51:42.200 --> 1:51:46.200]  witnessing people want both sides or three or four sides
[1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:49.720]  they want it it makes your ratings go up but the media is still willing
[1:51:49.720 --> 1:51:53.480]  to kill itself to be able to maintain the political control because they're not
[1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:55.560]  in the business of making money at the news level
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:51:59.640]  they're in the business of making money for the larger global agenda and massive
[1:51:59.640 --> 1:52:04.040]  trillion dollar banker bailouts but finish the rest of story i apologize
[1:52:04.040 --> 1:52:07.080]  that's okay uh no and then you know the funny thing is is
[1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:10.360]  i heard one of your other callers yesterday talking about you know you're
[1:52:10.360 --> 1:52:13.800]  trying to bring stories to the newsroom you know people just you know they
[1:52:13.800 --> 1:52:17.400]  look at you like you're crazy like you know you're one of those nuts
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:21.160]  and i said no i said look here's information here's documentation
[1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:24.760]  this is important stuff so they're like when you get labeled
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:28.520]  but then you're kind of labeled in the newsroom you're kind of an outcast
[1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:32.520]  so they thought the best way to you know help me not put out the message was to
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:35.960]  put me on a morning show and make it fun yeah he's got a good personality you
[1:52:35.960 --> 1:52:39.000]  know sir that's a handbook when they walked in and shamrock communications
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:42.200]  had the number one show in talk radio period at austin
[1:52:42.200 --> 1:52:45.240]  after three years on air i'm 25 years old
[1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:48.520]  i'm making them tons of money and they said you're gonna do an entertainment
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:52.360]  show now in the morning or we're gonna fire you
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:55.320]  and i said i can't stop us six weeks later they fired me with pleasure
[1:52:55.320 --> 1:52:58.280]  and they said because you're talking about bill clinton now i'd already
[1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:02.120]  started my other shows it didn't matter but i have experience where you're
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:05.960]  going to do entertainment now buddy do you understand or next you're fired
[1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:09.800]  please continue so so then uh it was right around
[1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:14.520]  the time the nb double a was signed and it was in the newscast which i didn't
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:17.800]  produce you know i could only add the uh
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:23.000]  the promos and the teases and and then uh you know i figured well since i can't
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:26.360]  really put it in the script well here's an opportunity we're going to go to a
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:29.800]  two-shot so go to the two shots and say hey you know um
[1:53:29.800 --> 1:53:33.800]  a lot of folks don't really know what that stands for what those acronyms mean
[1:53:33.800 --> 1:53:37.880]  and then i explained a little bit about it and then she just kind of looked at
[1:53:37.880 --> 1:53:41.480]  me my co-worker and just i don't know you're getting information i'm like
[1:53:41.480 --> 1:53:44.680]  well it's out there here's a copy of that's how brainwash they don't even
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:47.480]  want you to say national defense authorization act
[1:53:47.480 --> 1:53:52.040]  like like having info is now like evil oh oh he's informed you're not allowed to
[1:53:52.040 --> 1:53:57.160]  nbc from new york sends it and we just say he's talking on his own
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:54:00.280]  we can't have that see it's programming folks
[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:04.040]  teleprompters down to us that's right and when trump
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:07.000]  you know is forced to use one because it's his actual speech that's fine but
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:10.840]  when he's attacking and he's saying look it's script written it's coming down to
[1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:15.880]  them so so so let me guess what happened next
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:19.720]  well you know i just uh i was no longer in the circle
[1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:24.840]  and i was kind of an outcast and i could just feel the pressure from beneath me
[1:54:24.840 --> 1:54:28.440]  because when you make your way to that position there's everybody on the bottom
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:31.880]  just gunning it just to put you out or to get you off
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:37.000]  so i was no longer invited to the parties and you know i'd leave the newsroom and
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:40.440]  i'd come back first they australize then they dehumanize you because they don't
[1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:42.920]  want to actually fire their friend they have to learn to hate you first because
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:47.400]  they're they're cowards number one so so how did it end
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:51.240]  well it was about uh just you know a couple of months into my second year
[1:54:51.240 --> 1:54:55.160]  they decided to let me go i was i was kind of having some health
[1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:59.320]  issues so i went to the doctor and uh you know i almost passed out so they
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:02.600]  were giving me checks and everything they said look don't go to work
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:06.280]  and they figured well maybe the morning show isn't for you it's too early
[1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:10.120]  so i presented that to my bosses and they they delayed me coming back and then
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:13.400]  before you know and i get a letter saying i'm gone
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:17.800]  and uh you know there's like 30 reasons why you could be let go
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:20.680]  like if you're a kid and you're suspended from school you're suspended
[1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:24.200]  because you're bitter you spit on somebody but in this case it was a
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:29.240]  general term for like uh just general you know misconduct
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:32.120]  got it well listen brother i gotta jump but thank you for your testimony we
[1:55:32.120 --> 1:55:35.320]  want to get more of those testimonies god bless you tony because that's what
[1:55:35.320 --> 1:55:38.120]  goes on behind the scenes where they're uh well we had
[1:55:38.120 --> 1:55:40.360]  newspaper reporters on about this they're just like yeah we all get in the room
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:43.480]  and they go we're gonna lie about trump just make stuff up everybody go get it
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:46.840]  i mean they don't even a song she's a real liberal you know like a really
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:49.960]  person i respect she's actually is a liberal not a you know kkk person
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:54.200]  masquerading is a liberal he's like this press climate we're all in
[1:55:54.200 --> 1:55:56.920]  danger hillary is a monster i mean it's like
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:01.240]  why is them it's so shameful to see this level of control
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:05.160]  and they're only destroying themselves the process yeah and the foundation is
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:08.360]  example of how corruption just breeds more corruption you would think you're
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:11.800]  the third third most important person in america and you still want to be more
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:15.560]  corrupt you have no reason to be corrupt but it's so much more out there to
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:19.000]  that and and i think as far as the black population
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.760]  and minorities period i think they see that and i think that they
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:24.840]  they don't want to they don't want to vote for a crook and they'll they'll
[1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:28.680]  probably vote for down the trunk well sure and a lot of polls he's way ahead
[1:56:28.680 --> 1:56:31.400]  but those are the scientific polls the big fake ones they put out where they
[1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:35.400]  had 15 percent more come on Reuters admits they had 15 percent more
[1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:38.280]  democrats the poll and then hillary's went in by 15 points
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:41.400]  no i mean you know it's like they don't they but because they put the
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:46.200]  methodology out it's like it's okay oh we stacked the deck we admit we do so
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:50.280]  it's all right what no yeah it's not it's not a true
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:54.840]  that you only if you know that the the true vision is looking at under undultrated lenses
[1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:57.480]  as if you're on the ground and i'm on the ground brother
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:01.720]  and i'm in i'm in the hood no mistaken and these individuals are walking around
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:05.880]  talking about i'm gonna vote for trump and it has very little to do
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:08.520]  with what it is that they think they can get from him
[1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:12.520]  is what it is they've been waiting for they've been waiting for a change in a
[1:57:12.520 --> 1:57:14.920]  growth they didn't get that from the previous administration
[1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:18.200]  and they feel abandoned by the the current administration and so they're
[1:57:18.200 --> 1:57:20.920]  going to do whatever they can to touch that's what i'm seeing on the streets
[1:57:20.920 --> 1:57:25.240]  i mean i would say half the black people i talked to say they like trump but
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:28.120]  they're almost embarrassed like well alex i can tell you but you know my
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:31.480]  neighbors don't like it and so yeah people just get past this fear and
[1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:34.200]  come out of the closet that's right that's right and i talked about that you
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:38.120]  know in in the speech and i'm hoping that donald trump will bring more black
[1:57:38.120 --> 1:57:42.520]  surrogates at these rallies so that you can display the the the
[1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:46.200]  dispel the myth that blacks aren't coming out and i'm not talking about
[1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:49.560]  like like uh entertainment you know alex i'm talking about
[1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:53.480]  giving a real speech to people that's what the kind of surrogate he needs out
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:56.280]  there right now absolutely he needs to absolutely hammer the
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:57:58.680]  daylights out of the globalist the problem is a lot of times he does the
[1:57:58.680 --> 1:58:01.720]  videos doesn't cover yeah so we have to get the videos we have to get the wrong
[1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:04.680]  stuff we have to put it out like info wars.com and
[1:58:04.680 --> 1:58:07.560]  prisonplanet.com and drudgereport.com are doing and that's why they
[1:58:07.560 --> 1:58:11.640]  want to censor trump uh you know i mean they have these fake debate coming up
[1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:14.920]  where he's back to back with hillary but then he doesn't get to ask her
[1:58:14.920 --> 1:58:19.560]  questions that's not a debate. No no she's been quite well with 260 days now.
[1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:22.840]  Listen i i really believe she's got serious health problems and the word
[1:58:22.840 --> 1:58:27.400]  is brain tumor uh the brain tumor was removed back in 2012
[1:58:27.400 --> 1:58:32.840]  uh and then and it's growing back so uh that's why she is not looking too
[1:58:32.840 --> 1:58:38.360]  hot that's the word brain tumor we'll be back.
[1:58:38.360 --> 1:58:49.080]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[1:58:49.080 --> 1:58:53.160]  brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it rob do
[1:58:53.160 --> 1:58:58.200]  joins us you worked i guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force did
[1:58:58.200 --> 1:59:00.440]  i'd been working all day i took a couple hours off
[1:59:00.440 --> 1:59:04.920]  coaching basketball i get in here at 8 30 i was kind of run down
[1:59:04.920 --> 1:59:07.640]  you know i just didn't feel like i was gonna make it and i really wanted to
[1:59:07.640 --> 1:59:11.000]  do a good job on the interview i got my bottle of brain force right there pop
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:13.560]  two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like
[1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:17.400]  bing everything just kind of clears up it's got four and a half stars
[1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:21.000]  people really love it read about it find out why third-party
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.920]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the
[1:59:24.920 --> 1:59:28.600]  best organic based systems that will blow your socks off
[1:59:28.600 --> 1:59:31.400]  i haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while but i probably could not
[1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:35.000]  have done it without brain force i went home about 6 45 this morning
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:38.760]  took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in
[1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:42.360]  you will find brain force and other game changing products

[2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:46.600]  across our border this can only be done with cooperation
[2:00:46.600 --> 2:00:53.080]  intelligence and intelligence sharing and joint operations between our two
[2:00:53.080 --> 2:00:57.320]  countries it's the only way it's going to happen

[2:01:07.640 --> 2:01:12.040]  of today there are many improvements that could be made
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:15.480]  that would make both mexico and the united states
[2:01:15.480 --> 2:01:21.960]  stronger and keep industry in our hemisphere we have tremendous
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:26.280]  competition from china and from all over the world

[2:02:14.760 --> 2:02:19.400]  and go overseas it increases poverty and pressure
[2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:24.520]  on social services as well as pressures on cross

[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:24.200]  branch it was common sense it's it's what trump really represents
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:29.000]  but when america has been walked all over and there are more chinese a week
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:33.240]  coming in than there are mexicans and they admit they come here
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:38.680]  and see it and report something it's a good thing to have babies free
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:42.360]  and to get citizenship
[2:03:44.280 --> 2:03:47.320]  and the articles when you read them say strangely

[2:04:01.960 --> 2:04:08.360]  nobody else lets you do that but germany and places like that because they're
[2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:13.800]  absolutely trying to bankrupt and create division
[2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:17.800]  that's wrong i can't go to china and get stuff free
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:22.360]  it's not racist and i'm not gonna play race card on that

[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  all right drugreport dot com has a daily caller article linked up that the
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:34.040]  first debate isn't a debate at all it's an event
[2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:38.360]  where hillary goes back to back with trump two different stages
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:41.560]  and they take basically pre-screen questions you can bet your bottom dollar
[2:08:41.560 --> 2:08:44.440]  on that now they said they're gonna have other
[2:08:44.440 --> 2:08:48.360]  debates that'll be actual debates we'll see if that happens because she never
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:51.320]  goes out on stage more than 15 20 minutes and she never speaks more than
[2:08:51.320 --> 2:08:55.400]  about eight minutes now i've got somebody who i'm a
[2:08:55.400 --> 2:08:58.440]  huge fan of i know most of your probably fans uh i know uh buckley
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:01.800]  her and obviously a huge fan and years ago it hanged
[2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:05.240]  dillbert cartoons on his wall in fact i had a whole wall of them
[2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:10.120]  uh dillbert creator endorses hillary out of fear for personal safety remember
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:13.560]  that article the don solazar wrote back on june 6
[2:09:13.560 --> 2:09:17.640]  so many death threats so many attacks okay okay i will support her
[2:09:17.640 --> 2:09:21.880]  you bet please back off and of course that's tongue-in-cheek in my view we're
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:27.080]  going to talk to the man himself here in just a moment uh but imagine even his
[2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:32.680]  light-hearted cartoons got massive threats
[2:09:32.680 --> 2:09:37.000]  can you imagine the threats we get can you imagine again it i've never seen
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:40.600]  this level of behavior and the new york times calling for Donald Trump to be
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:43.800]  killed so i thought we'd play a little boil down because why this guy is even
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:47.800]  more interesting not just for his cartoons but all the predictions
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:53.560]  he's made that have come true sometimes decades before
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:57.000]  really uncanny so obviously a smart guy we're gonna be going to him here
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:10:01.080]  in just a moment here's a short boil down of scott adams the creator
[2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:05.320]  an artist behind dillbert uh looking into his crystal ball
[2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:09.400]  joining me to talk trump is scott adams he's the creator of dillbert against
[2:10:09.400 --> 2:10:13.560]  scott on his blog has been analyzing the rise of the republican frontrunner for
[2:10:13.560 --> 2:10:16.760]  months now and frankly he has some of the most interesting and
[2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:20.760]  accurate observations about white trump is appealing to so many people
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:25.080]  and i called him to be the landslide winner in the general election
[2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:29.640]  last year because the tools he's using essentially he's basically taking a
[2:10:29.640 --> 2:10:33.480]  flamethrower to a stick fight there's nobody using the same tools he's using
[2:10:33.480 --> 2:10:37.160]  so you have another theory about trump saying that he uses certain words in
[2:10:37.160 --> 2:10:41.880]  almost almost hypnotizes the audience what do you mean by that
[2:10:41.880 --> 2:10:45.560]  so well it's for background i'm a trained hypnotist and i've been studying
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:49.880]  persuasion all of my life as part of what i do for a living as a writer
[2:10:49.880 --> 2:10:53.960]  and i noticed back in august of last year that trump was using
[2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:57.720]  persuasion techniques to perfection when it looked like he was just a crazy
[2:10:57.720 --> 2:11:01.720]  clown saying random things but if you look at his method from a
[2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:05.720]  trained persuaders point of view it's been perfect perfection from the
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:09.160]  beginning it just looks random to someone who's not trained and had a
[2:11:09.160 --> 2:11:12.280]  persuasion he has complete ignoring of facts
[2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:15.400]  are actually part of the persuasion because he doesn't give you targets he
[2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:18.520]  doesn't give you details of his policies usually
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:22.280]  um so he's he's reducing the number of targets
[2:11:22.280 --> 2:11:25.560]  while making you feel good and focus on the things he wants
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:28.680]  so it's not about facts it's about focus and attention thing is this like what
[2:11:28.680 --> 2:11:31.720]  you're talking about when you say like the linguistic kill shot whether
[2:11:31.720 --> 2:11:35.960]  calling jeb bush low energy or or something else yeah so the linguistic
[2:11:35.960 --> 2:11:39.160]  kill shot is finding some kind of a insult if you can call it that this
[2:11:39.160 --> 2:11:43.320]  sticks like other insults would not and he likes to pick things that are
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:45.720]  visual you look at the person and say yeah that
[2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:49.240]  that feels kind of right but he also picks words and phrases that haven't
[2:11:49.240 --> 2:11:53.160]  been used before so they haven't been polluted by other meaning which is a
[2:11:53.160 --> 2:11:56.280]  good technique so when you say somebody's low energy
[2:11:56.280 --> 2:11:59.880]  there's nobody else that you ever talked about like that when i heard uh low
[2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:03.480]  energy i called low energy right yeah i called the end of bush
[2:12:03.480 --> 2:12:08.200]  that day because that is a sticky right insult so these are not random insults
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:10.920]  i'm not saying they're random i'm not i'm not saying they don't work i'm just
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:15.880]  saying he brands people low energy crazy crooked no but there's
[2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:19.160]  something else to it he's he's working on confirmation bias
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:22.520]  when you see anything come out in the news that looks like maybe hillary
[2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:25.560]  clinton did something a little bit suspicious you say
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:29.480]  crooked hillary the brilliant thing he did recently was he came up with a
[2:12:29.480 --> 2:12:34.200]  second one for clinton he said well is she heartless is it heartless hillary
[2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:37.720]  or is it crooked hillary and he actually made people debate
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:41.400]  whether she was more heartless or more crooked
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:44.920]  and that's all intentional this is all technique because democrats like to say
[2:12:44.920 --> 2:12:48.440]  that they'd love to run against trump you you clearly think that they're
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:54.360]  underestimating him yeah based on uh his talent stack alone
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:57.960]  if you look at any individual talent he has you could say well that's not the
[2:12:57.960 --> 2:13:00.840]  best in the world but look how many he's put together
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:04.280]  he knows strategy business strategy he knows negotiating
[2:13:04.280 --> 2:13:07.000]  he's a he's the best persuader i've ever seen
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:11.960]  he's quick in his feet he's funny he uh you know he's smart enough he knows
[2:13:11.960 --> 2:13:14.920]  enough about politics so when you put that stack together
[2:13:14.920 --> 2:13:18.440]  nobody really stands up to that stack i i've been predicting he's going to win
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:21.320]  in the landslides since last year not just in the nomination but the
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:23.880]  presidency yeah i think it'll be one of the biggest
[2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:30.200]  margins of victory uh in history there you go now Scott Adams joins us Scott
[2:13:30.200 --> 2:13:36.120]  i've got to say that i i think a lot of what you would call
[2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:42.360]  trained programming is actually just instinctive in alpha males and leaders
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:46.520]  and sure he's he's gotten better at it uh and and and it made it more technical
[2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:49.640]  over the years as a manager and a salesman but people think all the time
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:52.280]  i'm doing trained stuff i was never trained in anything
[2:13:52.280 --> 2:13:54.760]  i really mean when i'm saying i think the missing element of what you were
[2:13:54.760 --> 2:13:58.680]  saying there is it is true she's crooked it is true she's obviously got health
[2:13:58.680 --> 2:14:01.320]  problems even obama's doctor i mean i think what really makes
[2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:04.760]  trump powerful is that he's telling the truth and and yes sometimes he does
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:08.440]  simplify what do you say Scott Adams creator of dillbert blog dot dillbert
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:11.720]  dot com well people can't tell the difference between
[2:14:11.720 --> 2:14:15.640]  the truth and something that's totally made up that that is one of the powers
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:19.160]  we don't possess what we do instead and this is
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:23.320]  something you need to understand to be a hypnotist is that people are rational
[2:14:23.320 --> 2:14:26.680]  all the time so what we really think is truth
[2:14:26.680 --> 2:14:30.920]  is usually confirmation bias now say the things can be true
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:36.120]  also by coincidence but usually we individuals don't have access to the
[2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:39.720]  you know the base facts we're just hearing it from somebody else we're
[2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:42.600]  putting it together from clues in our environment
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:46.600]  so most of what we recognize to be truth is really just confirmation bias and
[2:14:46.600 --> 2:14:50.600]  this is true on both sides by the way i agree for the general dumb down public
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:55.160]  but i mean we deal in the real i mean i do the real system
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:59.880]  the real program of how cultures set up and operating and the different
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:04.680]  competing systems and i find uh trump to be very very accurate very very on
[2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:06.840]  target i mean his speech in mexico that had a
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:10.920]  lot of facts in it it did and that's part of his persuasion
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:14.360]  because if you look at what the other side was trying to do to him
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:18.040]  um they're persuaders and i think there's one in particular who's
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:22.120]  who's probably behind it um i've speculated that
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:25.800]  rubber childini who's famous for writing the book influence
[2:15:25.800 --> 2:15:28.840]  who would be one of the best influencers in the world
[2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:33.480]  um might be consulting for clinton um he did help
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:37.480]  obama's campaign so it'd be it would be odd if he wasn't helping this time as
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:40.840]  well but the situation that they'd set up
[2:15:40.840 --> 2:15:45.960]  is a confirmation bias trap that they built around trump
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:50.200]  that made um his opponents think that everything he did was
[2:15:50.200 --> 2:15:54.520]  one of these things it's either crazy or uninformed or it's racist or
[2:15:54.520 --> 2:15:59.000]  um it's it's another sign of his thin skin and his bad temperament
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:04.680]  so they set up a bunch of confirmation bias traps that everything he does
[2:16:04.680 --> 2:16:09.000]  can be interpreted to be one of those things if you're already inclined to
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:11.560]  think that way so that's how persuasion works
[2:16:11.560 --> 2:16:15.640]  now it's the same technique that trump uses in the other direction
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:20.120]  but so what he needed to do to try to wiggle out of that trap
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:23.880]  is try to do anything that showed he is well informed
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:28.360]  at least on one topic and i think having 10 bullet points and talking about it
[2:16:28.360 --> 2:16:32.440]  for i don't know how long you talk 45 minutes or an hour
[2:16:32.440 --> 2:16:35.800]  um i think he's sold that so the people who said
[2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:40.600]  trump can't learn he doesn't care about the details uh he's not serious
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:44.200]  um wasn't it daring and really smart move to go to new
[2:16:44.200 --> 2:16:46.280]  orleans and the flooding when hillary wouldn't to go to
[2:16:46.280 --> 2:16:49.800]  mexico and then say you know get down here hillary
[2:16:49.800 --> 2:16:53.640]  yeah that's great optics because he's also working on the uh the impression
[2:16:53.640 --> 2:16:57.720]  which he's created that uh hillary doesn't have this stamina
[2:16:57.720 --> 2:17:01.080]  plus it looks presidential when he's standing next to a president
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:06.360]  yeah so he's got all the optics right um and that also works toward the uh is he
[2:17:06.360 --> 2:17:09.960]  a crazy racist because you see him talking to the president of
[2:17:09.960 --> 2:17:12.600]  mexico and the two of them are getting along fine
[2:17:12.600 --> 2:17:16.440]  you know that didn't turn into a slap fight you know the next president's
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:20.120]  body language after the meeting was he really suddenly liked trump
[2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:23.720]  well everything i hear about trump in person is that people do like him in
[2:17:23.720 --> 2:17:27.160]  person um his personality is a little bit different in
[2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:30.600]  in public and it's even different again at a rally
[2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:34.040]  than it is at a press conference yeah now trump trump
[2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:38.120]  i mean the trump people see on the trail and stuff is trump but
[2:17:38.120 --> 2:17:43.160]  the trump behind the scenes is like the guy's got amazing charisma and he's
[2:17:43.160 --> 2:17:46.520]  very smart that's why here and by the way uh the
[2:17:46.520 --> 2:17:51.000]  definition of a charisma according to the scientists is kind of interesting
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:55.720]  charisma say the experts is the combination of power
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:59.480]  plus empathy now he's already he's already got the power
[2:17:59.480 --> 2:18:03.640]  so people people already saw that and and if they didn't see that they saw him
[2:18:03.640 --> 2:18:06.840]  just annihilate the competitors in the primaries
[2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:10.440]  and so now they believe he has power can't we have this guy's president i mean
[2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:14.920]  this is awesome he's gotta be president but hold on part two part two is
[2:18:14.920 --> 2:18:19.960]  where his problem was he had the power for charisma but he lacked the empathy
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:24.920]  because he was taking a hard-nosed approach to immigration and other
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:28.280]  other topics and so that made him look like well maybe he's a little bit
[2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:31.560]  don't you think that's the tactic is to be you know the good cop bad cop he's
[2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:34.440]  first the bad cop now he's a good cop
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:38.440]  i think he needed a different tactic in the primaries of course
[2:18:38.440 --> 2:18:42.680]  and he needed to soften it in the general and he's well on his way to doing
[2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:45.960]  that so i think his immigration speech was a
[2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:49.240]  a huge step well sure scott annum's i would love to have you one
[2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:51.880]  sometime just about your the technicals being hypnotized you know all your
[2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:55.000]  amazing uh you know comics uh dilbert dot com blog dot
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:59.080]  dilbert dot com but but specifically though
[2:18:59.080 --> 2:19:03.000]  you saying you got so many threats so you endorsed hillary and i can see here
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:06.520]  you're kind of i don't see riding the rail but i think you like trump i mean
[2:19:06.520 --> 2:19:08.840]  i think it's obvious that you want trump to be president
[2:19:08.840 --> 2:19:13.880]  but in this media climate of censorship and persecution
[2:19:13.880 --> 2:19:18.120]  you're just giving him backhanded compliments that's not exactly true
[2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:21.960]  i'm actually completely serious when i say that i'm endorsing hillary clinton
[2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:27.320]  for my physical safety and it's working so prior to saying that publicly
[2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:30.440]  i was getting comments on online mostly on twitter
[2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:35.160]  comparing me to joseph gobbles you know hitler's uh pr person
[2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:38.760]  and but in reality it's nazi germany where you have to endorse hitler
[2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:42.280]  or hitler comes after you uh yeah you could make that argument
[2:19:42.280 --> 2:19:46.280]  but the point is that if i wanted to talk about trumps persuasion skills which is
[2:19:46.280 --> 2:19:49.800]  the thing that interested me and my audience i couldn't do that
[2:19:49.800 --> 2:19:53.960]  with physical safety if people imagine that that also meant i backed his
[2:19:53.960 --> 2:19:56.840]  policies and so let me say as clearly as i can
[2:19:56.840 --> 2:20:00.120]  that my personal political preferences don't align
[2:20:00.120 --> 2:20:04.520]  with either clinton or trump i'm not very close to either of them on anything
[2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:07.560]  uh so if you say who would i prefer to be president
[2:20:07.560 --> 2:20:12.040]  on an entertainment basis of course trump on a policy basis i'm not smart
[2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:16.440]  enough to know who's got the best policies
[2:20:16.440 --> 2:20:20.120]  bottom line they're they're creating a new macartheism
[2:20:20.120 --> 2:20:23.880]  but with no teeth claiming that everyone i mean hillary has actually said
[2:20:23.880 --> 2:20:26.600]  in her speech when she attacked myself and others last week
[2:20:26.600 --> 2:20:30.760]  that the alt right and and um right bar and and
[2:20:30.760 --> 2:20:36.600]  others and trump actually take orders from vladimir putin i mean i've never
[2:20:36.600 --> 2:20:40.280]  been to russia it's total bull i've been on russian tv i've been on
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:43.000]  japanese tv and british tv more than russian tv i'm not taking orders from
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:45.320]  the british either i've been on mexican tv i'm not taking orders from the
[2:20:45.320 --> 2:20:49.720]  mexicans i mean this is a new level talk about conspiracy theories and then
[2:20:49.720 --> 2:20:53.640]  she made up stuff that i supposedly stand for or twisted it and then said
[2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:57.560]  what type of dark heart i want to play this for you what type of dark
[2:20:57.560 --> 2:21:01.160]  heart does alex jones haven't clutched her heart clearly it was scripted
[2:21:01.160 --> 2:21:04.760]  i want to ask you as a top hypnotist i know you're famous for that as well
[2:21:04.760 --> 2:21:07.880]  what you think of this uh bit of propaganda here it is
[2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:14.840]  what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be
[2:21:14.840 --> 2:21:19.880]  to say things like that but trump doesn't challenge these lies
[2:21:19.880 --> 2:21:25.560]  he actually went on jones's show and said your reputation is amazing i will not
[2:21:25.560 --> 2:21:30.040]  let you down this from the man who wants to be
[2:21:30.040 --> 2:21:34.600]  president of the united states and i'm told we haven't found you but i got
[2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:38.280]  tweets and calls about obama shot his mouth off at some dinner about me last
[2:21:38.280 --> 2:21:42.600]  night but i mean this is really getting weird uh when she's talking about dark
[2:21:42.600 --> 2:21:45.080]  hearts and clutching her heart i mean what do you make of that
[2:21:45.080 --> 2:21:48.840]  neural linguistic programming so you notice that
[2:21:48.840 --> 2:21:53.880]  right after the uh gop convention as soon as trump got done talking all the
[2:21:53.880 --> 2:21:58.600]  pundits started using the same word dark that's not a coincidence that comes
[2:21:58.600 --> 2:22:02.200]  from somebody who's trained in persuasion on their side and again it's
[2:22:02.200 --> 2:22:06.920]  probably gildini uh and what dark does is it primes you
[2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:10.200]  um and this is something gildini writes about in his new book called
[2:22:10.200 --> 2:22:13.240]  persuasion which is coming out in a few weeks and you should definitely buy it
[2:22:13.240 --> 2:22:15.800]  if you want to understand anything about the election
[2:22:15.800 --> 2:22:21.320]  um it it sort of primes the viewer for anything that comes after fitting the
[2:22:21.320 --> 2:22:24.360]  mold of dark so it's a it's a linguistic kill
[2:22:24.360 --> 2:22:27.640]  shot of its own type and it primes you to see everything in this
[2:22:27.640 --> 2:22:31.960]  tinged dark way but you notice that um six months ago
[2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:36.920]  uh clinton's selling points where she's the one with the experience and the
[2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:40.840]  facts and the you know she's she's the rational one the history she's the
[2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:42.760]  safe one she's the steady hand even though she
[2:22:42.760 --> 2:22:46.520]  starts all these illegal wars and creates fell states let's expand on that
[2:22:46.520 --> 2:22:49.480]  because assange we have this clip coming up later after alibis but it's on
[2:22:49.480 --> 2:22:53.240]  info wars dot com wiki leaks at a new york times interview and he said listen
[2:22:53.240 --> 2:22:57.000]  this woman's a demon i've got the email she's super dangerous she's a mobster
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:00.120]  she's gonna hang the press because they are i've got stacks she said in a
[2:23:00.120 --> 2:23:04.360]  campaign letter they're gonna shut down the alt conservatives i mean this is
[2:23:04.360 --> 2:23:07.480]  bold i'm holding the daily caller article with the snippets of the email
[2:23:07.480 --> 2:23:11.160]  right here they actually say we have no right to exist talk about hit larian
[2:23:11.160 --> 2:23:14.440]  talk about final solution and assange says
[2:23:14.440 --> 2:23:18.040]  he finally gave a hint he said well a lot of it is how
[2:23:18.040 --> 2:23:21.640]  they're coordinating everything it's all coordinated well the earlier email show
[2:23:21.640 --> 2:23:24.280]  that where they're ordering everybody exactly what to do
[2:23:24.280 --> 2:23:27.400]  i mean this is not what you have in a free society
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:31.880]  well uh let me say you're talking maybe about the uh wiki leaks a memo about
[2:23:31.880 --> 2:23:37.000]  cnn and their producers talking in advance with before the interview says
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  that's what you're talking about there's a bunch of them there's thousands of
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:42.680]  these these are yes but coordinating what to do i mean you pointed out how
[2:23:42.680 --> 2:23:46.200]  within one minute of the end of trump's speech it was dark dark dark everywhere
[2:23:46.200 --> 2:23:49.400]  articles already written these talking points go out
[2:23:49.400 --> 2:23:53.080]  all right but let me say just on the point of cnn and their producers it is
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:56.440]  normal business for them to discuss in advance what the
[2:23:56.440 --> 2:23:59.560]  questions are they do that with me they do it that with most of the guests
[2:23:59.560 --> 2:24:03.000]  i don't know that they would do that with the
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:06.760]  you know if if they had one of the candidates on there might be more
[2:24:06.760 --> 2:24:10.440]  preparation there but or less preparation just so they could surprise
[2:24:10.440 --> 2:24:13.080]  there's more coordination than that i mean they were like sending people to go
[2:24:13.080 --> 2:24:16.600]  after trump with bernie sanders people dressed up as bernie sanders supporters
[2:24:16.600 --> 2:24:19.640]  there's a lot of coordination i'm not sure what you know you're sure sure
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:23.080]  yeah i'm not saying that there isn't some of that going on but there's also some
[2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:27.640]  confirmation bias sure we we see it where it isn't as well as where it is
[2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:31.480]  no no i hear you and and for folks that don't know about
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:35.640]  that particular term why don't you define it for him so confirmation bias is
[2:24:35.640 --> 2:24:38.520]  where you've already made up your mind that something's true
[2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:41.400]  and then any evidence you see in your environment
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:45.160]  whether it supports that fact or not you imagine that it does
[2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:48.920]  so if for imagine you've you've decided that trump is a racist
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:52.120]  then if he talks about something like border security which really doesn't have
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:54.920]  anything to do with the race it's just something you do with all your borders
[2:24:54.920 --> 2:24:59.000]  all the time every country sovereignty and then then you just say to yourself
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:01.800]  well that's probably another example of them being racist because i already
[2:25:01.800 --> 2:25:05.800]  decided they say he wants to uh put gay people in prison and ship blacks back
[2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:08.680]  to africa and it just it's all totally made up
[2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:12.760]  yeah this is made up as it could be but on the clinton side there's
[2:25:12.760 --> 2:25:16.200]  there's clearly some coordination with the mainstream
[2:25:16.200 --> 2:25:20.040]  media but probably a little bit you know over imagined
[2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:26.520]  as well uh you know two years ago congress legalized the cia and
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:30.360]  being involved in domestic propaganda operations they call it propaganda
[2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:33.960]  placement well i coined that term they call it behavior placement
[2:25:33.960 --> 2:25:37.960]  and it's congress ruled it was illegal 10 years ago
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:43.880]  but and said stop you know funding it but it's only expanding so i think
[2:25:43.880 --> 2:25:47.560]  there's deeper layers to this but but obviously this confirmation bias
[2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:52.600]  famously you think maybe you think the cia is involved in trying to influence
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:55.480]  the election oh absolutely here i mean they've
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:25:59.400]  had the former cia directors and others come out and and demonize trump
[2:25:59.400 --> 2:26:02.600]  we actually i have the washington post on screen
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:05.960]  us repeals propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans i mean
[2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:10.520]  it's it's full on well the government made news is
[2:26:10.520 --> 2:26:13.800]  for which purpose i mean that doesn't necessarily mean it's
[2:26:13.800 --> 2:26:18.120]  two years ago they operate they authorized domestic cia operations
[2:26:18.120 --> 2:26:21.480]  it's a fact i've interviewed the police chiefs everybody dealt the force comes
[2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:25.640]  in with big bags of money buys off the local uh local mayor
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:30.280]  it's all part of cgo g for what messages what what just to be prepared
[2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:33.800]  during a collapse or civil emergency to go with the
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:37.240]  particular party in power it's pre-preparation coming to nazi's in
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:40.040]  france about three years before they invaded they had almost the whole
[2:26:40.040 --> 2:26:43.720]  general staff already paid off ready to stand down the blitzkrieg really didn't
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:46.920]  do anything the french just stood down and that's a historical fact it's just
[2:26:46.920 --> 2:26:50.760]  not widely widely circulated okay
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:54.360]  oh the british fought and then and then they got beaten and sent to dunkirk and
[2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:57.560]  you know had to have the famous navel flotilla escape
[2:26:57.560 --> 2:27:00.840]  do you do you think we're close to uh um
[2:27:00.840 --> 2:27:05.560]  marshal law and obama trying to retain power i don't think obama is going to
[2:27:05.560 --> 2:27:08.920]  try to maintain power but the but the establishment power structure
[2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:12.680]  like golden sacks that actually installs leaders presidents and prime ministers
[2:27:12.680 --> 2:27:16.040]  in greece and idly now at davos they've called for a move
[2:27:16.040 --> 2:27:21.480]  to technocracy and basically installing uh bank heads as presidents
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:25.000]  you know i think we ought to take a look at our
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:29.560]  our system of government um if you ask me it's already changed in ways that the
[2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:32.600]  founders didn't plan exactly it's a soft marshal law
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:35.800]  well we uh i'm going a different direction i'm saying that
[2:27:35.800 --> 2:27:39.800]  um you know we're republic by design but because of the internet
[2:27:39.800 --> 2:27:43.560]  um a good idea can bubble up from any individual
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:47.560]  if it gets viral then the mainstream media has to pay attention to sure
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:50.920]  and if they pay attention to it there's a good chance it's going to become policy
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:53.960]  so i would argue that we have devolved into a
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:58.920]  something closer to a direct democracy accidentally
[2:27:58.920 --> 2:28:01.720]  maybe a direct democracy of multinational corporations voting with
[2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:05.880]  their campaign contributions but no but i think i think trump
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:10.840]  um signals the end of that model that you just described i agree with
[2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:15.160]  so the old model and by old i mean sort of right now
[2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:19.640]  you know last year is old um was that the lobbyists and the big money people
[2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:23.320]  were doing everything and and selling it to the public as
[2:28:23.320 --> 2:28:27.160]  as they had something to do with the decisions but now
[2:28:27.160 --> 2:28:30.360]  i think that's actually becoming true because the internet
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:33.560]  that you could make enough noise in the internet your argument can be good or
[2:28:33.560 --> 2:28:37.080]  not i agree there's a giant tsunami of awakening and human
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:40.120]  empowerment coming but there is an totalitarian push back to that that's
[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:44.120]  what i was getting at scott adam's really smart guy blog dot delbert dot com
[2:28:44.120 --> 2:28:47.640]  i hope you'll come back with us sometime in the future are you still predicting
[2:28:47.640 --> 2:28:53.720]  uh landslide for donald j trump i am based on technique not policies and
[2:28:53.720 --> 2:28:58.360]  it looks like clinton's not going to make it uh to the to the end line i'm
[2:28:58.360 --> 2:29:01.320]  based on what she looked like yesterday so you but i don't think it's a
[2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:04.680]  conspiracy theory that she looks sick even obama's former doctor uh who's a
[2:29:04.680 --> 2:29:09.080]  democrat is saying she looks really bad well there's a lot of variability in
[2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:12.120]  her appearance and that's what i pointed out i'm not trying to be a doctor
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:16.600]  i'm just making sure she looks like hell uh scott adam's one last question um
[2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:19.800]  are you concerned or have you heard homeland security now is going to step
[2:29:19.800 --> 2:29:22.600]  in and run the election for the first time ever
[2:29:22.600 --> 2:29:27.400]  what i'm not kidding look it up homeland security is going to run the election
[2:29:27.400 --> 2:29:30.120]  yes sir here's the deal you have a normalcy bias
[2:29:30.120 --> 2:29:33.480]  because you're a good guy you don't think as evil as these people do even
[2:29:33.480 --> 2:29:36.920]  though you're sophisticated and smart i'm asking you to see that confirmation
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:39.720]  bias that's even bigger because you're not a psychopath

[2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:50.520]  trump was unstoppable populism you know the brakes that had just passed nigel
[2:33:50.520 --> 2:33:53.800]  for us into new order but now i feel like the polls are against trump it's all
[2:33:53.800 --> 2:33:57.000]  dissipating and i said that's because you tune into mainstream media that's not
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:34:00.440]  what's happening in the real world they just need to create enough of a hoax
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:03.880]  so they can steal the election and make it look like trump lost
[2:34:03.880 --> 2:34:07.400]  and keep all these arrested development people like children

[2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:35.240]  think i've ever seen a traffic jam two and a half miles back
[2:34:35.240 --> 2:34:38.440]  where you guys had to get out of the cars and walk in i mean this was crazy
[2:34:38.440 --> 2:34:41.720]  well i got there me and michael zimmerman were the first ones there
[2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:45.000]  that day we got there around one one thirty in the afternoon
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  and there was already a line wrapped around the expositions
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:52.200]  exposition center where they do the road and he wasn't gonna speak till 7 30
[2:34:52.200 --> 2:34:55.400]  yeah until 7 30 there was a guy that was waiting in line told me that they got
[2:34:55.400 --> 2:34:59.000]  there at three in the morning waited outside of the gate outside of the
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:02.840]  exposition center and then waited in line as they kept opening up the fences
[2:35:02.840 --> 2:35:05.800]  throughout that area so they could get closer and closer and be in front of
[2:35:05.800 --> 2:35:08.920]  the line i mean that that's crazy you don't see that at
[2:35:08.920 --> 2:35:12.120]  hillary clinton and let's understand it two and a half miles away by the time
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:14.920]  do got there hours before it stopped they had to get out and walk yeah they had
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:18.040]  to walk it at the end of the road where you come out of the exposition center
[2:35:18.040 --> 2:35:21.080]  there's this long road that goes about five miles of the left
[2:35:21.080 --> 2:35:24.120]  and two miles of the right the straightaway and was lined with cars on
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:27.560]  both sides parked tons of that's a major highway
[2:35:27.560 --> 2:35:31.720]  yeah i mean it's out in the middle of nowhere too so we do concerts at the
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:34.680]  rodeo i a buddy of mine took one of those
[2:35:34.680 --> 2:35:38.360]  panoramic photos i put it up on twitter from the inside yeah we know
[2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:40.600]  this place well because we're out there all the time i think my kids see monster
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:43.640]  trucks you name it i mean i've been i've been in that facility
[2:35:43.640 --> 2:35:48.040]  70 times willy nelson you name it i mean i i went in with the minds that are
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:50.760]  we're in liberal austin there's not going to be that many people here and when i
[2:35:50.760 --> 2:35:53.640]  got there my mind was just completely blown to see
[2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:59.240]  that many people in an area that's so liberal people coming from all over
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:03.000]  you know but it's not i've been there at the elections in the state
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:06.280]  admitted we discovered fraud was all over the newspapers and they said we're
[2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:09.880]  still sort of finding the election it's not democrat until now
[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:14.200]  it's the invasion port from the failed california op they blow that
[2:36:14.200 --> 2:36:17.480]  now they're going to exploit the next sector you know there was a video we
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:20.120]  posted i believe it was yesterday where they had this uh
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:23.720]  trump impersonator guy that was on in the video and he's walking around and this
[2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:27.160]  guy's like talking to him interviewing him and he said you know do you get any
[2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:30.600]  backlash from coming out and being trump and you know in speaking and he goes
[2:36:30.600 --> 2:36:33.240]  no he goes everyone comes up to me they all want a
[2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:36.840]  picture they all say they love trump he said whatever you see on tv is a
[2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:40.280]  complete and total lie it's bs but there are the hundred or so or two
[2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:43.080]  hundreds sometimes 500 with hillary busses them in which we said from our
[2:36:43.080 --> 2:36:46.600]  sources now all confirm not sanders people dressed up
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:49.800]  like sanders to make his people look bad and make trump look bad see divide and
[2:36:49.800 --> 2:36:53.000]  conquer folks he's playing both ends you know to take them down
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:56.680]  and there were slash tires there were some people attacked
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:36:59.960]  and as usual it was the anti-trump people doing it was like when i went to
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:02.680]  the uh trump rally in dallas when i was sitting up there in the middle of the
[2:37:02.680 --> 2:37:04.840]  protest and the police officer came up to me
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:08.360]  admitted that these guys have been busted we have video they pushed us over
[2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:10.680]  or whatever push us out of the way like all right you guys get out of the way
[2:37:10.680 --> 2:37:13.720]  we want to get these agitators out of here so they can catch the bus and get
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:16.520]  back out of here you know this time it was a smaller
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:20.920]  amount of people 70 to 100 people but they lived in this little neighborhood
[2:37:20.920 --> 2:37:24.120]  that was right across the street there was hardly anyone else that came
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:27.880]  from downtown austin from the liberal trendy area from the surrounding areas
[2:37:27.880 --> 2:37:31.320]  it was just the people who live out now in fairness mainline brainwashed
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:35.080]  liberals are the laziest people on earth oh yeah so i mean there there are
[2:37:35.080 --> 2:37:37.560]  hordes of them that don't like trump well they were down they were downtown

[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:46.360]  biggest mass murderer on earth uh the hillary clinton look like

[2:38:58.040 --> 2:39:02.040]  that people are lacking the amount of energy you get electrochemically
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:05.240]  from selenium is life or death i mean when you've got enough selenium it's
[2:39:05.240 --> 2:39:07.080]  amazing read the study for yourself if you don't have
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:09.960]  enough selenium if you're a male it will take it from your brain that has to
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:12.440]  happen and give it to your testicles because your body says that you know

[2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:08.680]  experience what i've experienced i i'm walking down the street
[2:41:08.680 --> 2:41:13.000]  10 years ago and maybe one out of five people said hey alex jones
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:16.280]  it's now like when i was in london and stuff it was i couldn't walk down the
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:19.800]  street in some case and people see this on live stream i'm like walking down the
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:22.760]  street live streaming and alex jones alex jones alex
[2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:25.160]  jones people all the world alex jones people from poland people from russia
[2:41:25.160 --> 2:41:28.440]  people from japan people from london people from pakistan alex jones oh
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:31.720]  it's like whoa whoa and again it's not about oh look i'm famous
[2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:35.000]  it's i'm not singing songs here that wouldn't matter if i was famous because
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.560]  of that they are resonating and agreeing with our
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:41.560]  anti-globalist anti-new world order message well you aren't famous
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:45.400]  okay but when you wear a hillary for prison shirt or an info war shirt
[2:41:45.400 --> 2:41:48.440]  or a drudge ought to sell shirts with drudgereport.com on it
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:51.240]  i guarantee you'd sell 50 million i'm telling drudging to do that he may
[2:41:51.240 --> 2:41:54.840]  already be doing it i just it needs to happen i i would promote him
[2:41:54.840 --> 2:41:57.400]  i mean all the licensed drudge ask drudge if i can sell them and you know
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:41:59.960]  split out the money with him because i mean we need to get these out they need
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:04.440]  to support the independent media and imagine nobody's wearing fox news even
[2:42:04.440 --> 2:42:07.880]  though it's better than seeing it you don't see cnn shirts you don't see msnbc
[2:42:07.880 --> 2:42:11.800]  shirts why don't we have drudge report shirts i mean
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:15.640]  what i'm saying is is that if you saw every 10th person wearing a drudge
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:18.680]  report shirt like we're seeing an awesome with info wars
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:22.680]  and bumper stickers almost on every corner that's citizens doing that it
[2:42:22.680 --> 2:42:25.480]  flips the system out and they understand that we
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:28.920]  are cutting through their signal we're cutting through their their blackout
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:32.920]  we're cutting through their iron curtain we're coming in with the real voice of
[2:42:32.920 --> 2:42:35.080]  america you want to know what this is this is the real
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:38.520]  voice of america folks coming to you of course from texas baby
[2:42:38.520 --> 2:42:42.440]  with joe biggs and the rest of the crew so i'm ranting here but the point is
[2:42:42.440 --> 2:42:46.280]  you go to a trump rally i've seen these videos sometimes in a crowd
[2:42:46.280 --> 2:42:49.880]  you'd be a third always about 15 we're wearing hillary for prison shirts
[2:42:49.880 --> 2:42:53.800]  or info wars shirts imagine what that telegraphs the system and it's all over
[2:42:53.800 --> 2:42:55.960]  the country it's all over the world and that's just
[2:42:55.960 --> 2:43:00.280]  little info wars joe biggs zimmerman and i were at the trump rally on tuesday
[2:43:00.280 --> 2:43:04.600]  and i had them bring me out two large boxes of those hillary for prison bumper
[2:43:04.600 --> 2:43:09.240]  i'm glad you thought of that and we filmed it and people swarmed around us
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:11.640]  we're like almost at the point of fighting over it
[2:43:11.640 --> 2:43:14.440]  you know and i was just we put that video out yet yeah and i was like
[2:43:14.440 --> 2:43:18.040]  clinton for sand quit and hillary for prison you know uh you know look how
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:21.560]  many hillary for prison churches you see i saw a ton on the videos oh lots i mean
[2:43:21.560 --> 2:43:24.680]  way too many even number i mean that's everywhere we go now though
[2:43:24.680 --> 2:43:27.880]  but i guarantee you there's i went to a metallica concert and they were like
[2:43:27.880 --> 2:43:30.120]  people were wearing info wars all over the place i went to they must stay in
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:33.320]  all over the place again it's crazy there's going to be 3 000 new cars in
[2:43:33.320 --> 2:43:37.160]  austin texas in the surrounding areas with hillary for prison bumper stickers on
[2:43:37.160 --> 2:43:40.360]  it i mean people were like give me two i've got it why didn't i think of that
[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:44.280]  i we should have hit him with 10 000 50 000 i got as many as i could but i mean
[2:43:44.280 --> 2:43:46.920]  it there's going to be a lot more out there and i think from now one of these
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:49.880]  by the way are those available yet on the site i don't know if you can buy them
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:52.360]  but what they're doing is every time someone makes a purchase at the info
[2:43:52.360 --> 2:43:54.840]  or store they throw in two or three with their
[2:43:54.840 --> 2:43:58.680]  order as well this is an added bonus well that's incredible well good job to
[2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:01.400]  those folks i want to get to some of these clips what's the name of that
[2:44:01.400 --> 2:44:03.400]  video so they can pull it up on youtube
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:09.640]  we'd have to look back at it it shows a huge line of people
[2:44:09.640 --> 2:44:13.240]  waiting and it says uh people go crazy for hillary for prison or something like
[2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:15.880]  that or austin ice go crazy for hillary for prison
[2:44:15.880 --> 2:44:18.680]  because i do a chant one and then it's the one right after that where there's a
[2:44:18.680 --> 2:44:22.440]  huge line it's 15 minutes long because we just let the camera roll
[2:44:22.440 --> 2:44:25.400]  as we because i walked all the way from the very beginning of the line to the
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:29.400]  tail end and that was around 130 or two that's another problem we have so many
[2:44:29.400 --> 2:44:32.600]  great videos that a lot of only it seemed like 30 40 000 people because we're
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:36.280]  putting 50 a day out yeah i mean which is still success but this
[2:44:36.280 --> 2:44:39.560]  should be seen by everybody i i have been spending hours at night during the
[2:44:39.560 --> 2:44:42.360]  day almost getting nothing done now just trying to watch what you guys did
[2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:45.560]  because it's all so informative and so entertaining well one of the craziest
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:47.880]  though one of my favorite video it's not that
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:51.320]  long but it's the black lives could care less about
[2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:54.280]  black lives we're going to get to that in a minute but first i want to just
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:58.120]  point out that you have won a thug life award
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:45:00.760]  uh and for folks that don't know what these are tell
[2:45:00.760 --> 2:45:04.360]  total listeners so it's whenever you basically uh do something that's
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:07.960]  pretty awesome and uh it's when you actually you essentially just have to
[2:45:07.960 --> 2:45:11.240]  like drop the mic and walk away because you just did something so epic
[2:45:11.240 --> 2:45:14.920]  and then they started making these videos where it's like sideways hat drops on
[2:45:14.920 --> 2:45:17.240]  your forehead and big glasses with diamonds and
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:22.040]  like a joint and a machine gun in your hand and they play like some dr dray
[2:45:22.040 --> 2:45:26.600]  song in the background so it's uh we think it's ludicrous
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:30.360]  baby out of the point is get out the way in fact okay here's the short clip and
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:33.320]  then we'll play the actual clip first uh here it is
[2:45:33.320 --> 2:45:37.000]  if i go to mexico right now illegally without citizenship and i don't have a
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:40.520]  passport i will go to jail okay okay and then if you're
[2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:44.040]  legal here you should go to jail or be deported okay i'm waiting for somebody
[2:45:44.040 --> 2:45:47.080]  to put me in jail now well donald trump's gonna do it stay tuned for more
[2:45:47.080 --> 2:45:58.920]  for us info wars dot com i'm joe bigs
[2:45:58.920 --> 2:46:01.640]  all right now let's get serious and get back to the clips let's play the one
[2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:06.360]  you said you want to play first and that is uh the black lives matter clip black
[2:46:06.360 --> 2:46:10.680]  lives matter not concerned with helping black lives here is joe bigs at the
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:19.240]  trump rally
[2:46:19.240 --> 2:46:22.840]  so if black lives matter did any of you guys go to louisiana
[2:46:22.840 --> 2:46:27.640]  help out
[2:46:27.640 --> 2:46:30.760]  did you go to louisiana to help out
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:35.000]  there you go who did go to louisiana trump you know who didn't go
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:41.880]  black lives matter exactly black lives matter black lives matter black lives matter
[2:46:41.880 --> 2:46:45.400]  you act like a child
[2:46:45.400 --> 2:46:48.120]  do they want to come to the president never did no one mess with them they're all sent
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:53.240]  by grips i said except louisiana except louisiana
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:46:57.400]  they go to louisiana and the police in the background are just kind of like
[2:46:57.400 --> 2:47:00.680]  smiling because they're like yeah you're saying you're screaming and chanting
[2:47:00.680 --> 2:47:03.560]  but you're not doing anything to save black lives they're being murdered and
[2:47:03.560 --> 2:47:06.920]  abortions when they're being killed by black on black crimes in Chicago
[2:47:06.920 --> 2:47:10.440]  you're not doing anything you're just sitting here in your chanting
[2:47:10.440 --> 2:47:13.400]  meanwhile there are people dying so if you actually cared
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:17.560]  about black lives you would get off your butt do something
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:21.160]  raise some money and and louisiana go out there get a boat
[2:47:21.160 --> 2:47:25.400]  save people guess who went there donald trump and it's now
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:29.160]  over 1,500 people shot in chicago this year over 90 percent of more blacks
[2:47:29.160 --> 2:47:33.240]  that's over a thousand black people shot over 500 almost 600 dead
[2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:35.960]  and you'll literally tell black lives matter about that they just don't even
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:38.680]  look at you they don't even hear you they don't even care
[2:47:38.680 --> 2:47:41.560]  it's drugs being shipped into the neighborhoods it's globalism
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:45.320]  it's the deindustrialization it's the mtv culture is why those neighborhoods
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:48.280]  are like that not because of the cops and we're not
[2:47:48.280 --> 2:47:52.600]  defending the police just out of hand it's just a total scapegoat
[2:47:52.600 --> 2:47:57.000]  to destabilize these inner city areas the democrats of the main people doing it
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:00.120]  then they have the police that are the lowest level of the government
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:04.040]  throw them at it and then blame them like a rearguard action
[2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:07.880]  that that it's their fault but why do you go and protest donald trump he's the
[2:48:07.880 --> 2:48:13.080]  only one that went there it took it took days to go
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:15.160]  out there because he was i don't need to be intellectual
[2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:18.440]  you are a racist have you seen the meme you're an effing white male
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:21.480]  have you seen the meme where you're a white male there's a car under
[2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:25.880]  white you're a white male at obama standing on
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:29.080]  top of the car and it looks like he's taking a chip shop and it says can i
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:31.800]  play through and meanwhile he's standing on top of a car that
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:35.480]  submerged underwater in louisiana and it says can i play through
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:38.360]  well that's okay because he's black oh my god it's ridiculous but they're
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:41.800]  standing outside of this event protesting the only person who went
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:46.120]  there the person who what you say doesn't matter you are a white male
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:49.400]  we have people all over the country march up and say safe space white women you

[2:49:17.240 --> 2:49:20.600]  because their topics might prove controversial we do not condone the
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:24.520]  creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:28.440]  and perspectives and odds with their own again welcome to the university of

[2:49:49.160 --> 2:49:53.560]  and the protest continues yeah and of course then they saw like a 30 drop in
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:57.160]  attendance the it's crazy man who would pay
[2:49:57.160 --> 2:50:01.000]  a hundred thousand dollars to send their young adult to one of these

[2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:45.400]  needle right there well they walk it behind her and pat her back
[2:50:45.400 --> 2:50:48.920]  like a piranha dog or something

[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:18.600]  i studied the criminality's people i know so much about them
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:23.960]  just like you do and it's just a joke i was asking you during the break
[2:54:23.960 --> 2:54:27.160]  do you think trumps gonna win repeat what you said
[2:54:27.160 --> 2:54:30.600]  lie it's gonna definitely be a landslide you know i've been all over the
[2:54:30.600 --> 2:54:34.280]  country to all these events and when you see the amount of people that show up
[2:54:34.280 --> 2:54:37.560]  the amount of people that come from other states and the surrounding states
[2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:41.640]  other countries uh it's amazing and notice this is america
[2:54:41.640 --> 2:54:45.000]  these are hardworking people that are motivated and will wait for hours and
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:48.520]  will drive to be a place it sure proves they're the folks that actually
[2:54:48.520 --> 2:54:51.640]  do the work in this country well there's also because i mean where are the jackass
[2:54:51.640 --> 2:54:53.400]  liberals they can't even show up to protest
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:56.440]  hillary has to bust them in and then they're so immoral
[2:54:56.440 --> 2:55:00.040]  they'll actually wear the burning shirts they're ordered to have and then repeat
[2:55:00.040 --> 2:55:03.800]  the slogans they're given what despicable horrible slaves well there's
[2:55:03.800 --> 2:55:06.840]  also been a progression though as far as trump supporters too
[2:55:06.840 --> 2:55:10.120]  you know at the beginning back when a lot of these violent riots protests were
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:12.280]  happening a lot of people were scared to wear trump
[2:55:12.280 --> 2:55:16.280]  shirts out in public and hats and now when i go out all across the country i'm
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:19.560]  seeing people in gas stations at restaurants proudly wearing
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:22.360]  trump shirts they're not in an event they're just wanted to be out and wear
[2:55:22.360 --> 2:55:24.120]  it you know and for a while people are kind of
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:27.720]  scared to do that and you're not seeing that anymore because we're winning
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:30.760]  we've we've defeated them already because people are seeing what we're
[2:55:30.760 --> 2:55:33.080]  showing here the massive amounts of people come
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:36.040]  absolutely just give people a radar sonar ping you've been here what a couple
[2:55:36.040 --> 2:55:39.080]  years uh almost three years wow how much do you
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:43.720]  notice now on your own street a good bit like on average let's say go
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:48.680]  downtown or go for airport you know in austin you know maybe
[2:55:48.680 --> 2:55:52.120]  four to five people if i go like on raining street or something
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:55.400]  you know but a lot of people will recognize my voice and then they'll go
[2:55:55.400 --> 2:55:57.400]  oh joe bigs because a lot of people don't watch
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:02.680]  it's constantly in fact exactly uh i saw the cops come up the hiking bike
[2:56:02.680 --> 2:56:04.680]  trail the other day they were ordered to give tickets to people down there because
[2:56:04.680 --> 2:56:08.440]  they closed it because the flooding and pat riley was with me and my
[2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:11.560]  son was with me we were hiking and i was shooting a video and peck was
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:14.920]  look and the cops heard my voice and went and the sergeant turns around he goes
[2:56:14.920 --> 2:56:18.440]  we're not giving tickets stop it's alex jones turn around
[2:56:18.440 --> 2:56:22.280]  let me start to get that on video but but my point is is that
[2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:26.040]  we get more people coming up to us than when i see mainstream media folks like
[2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:30.360]  charlie rose walking around uh in cleveland no one was coming up to him so i
[2:56:30.360 --> 2:56:33.080]  ran over to him he's walking around with thousands of people around no one wants
[2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:36.200]  to talk to charlie rose he has a morning cbs show
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:40.200]  supposedly with five million viewers no one even cares about it i saw him uh
[2:56:40.200 --> 2:56:43.240]  one of the days and i just kind of went oh look it's charlie rose and then i just
[2:56:43.240 --> 2:56:47.080]  kept walking you know because there's really no connection there for me
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:50.600]  because he's not really promoting anything that i want to be a part of
[2:56:50.600 --> 2:56:53.400]  it's just that i've seen him before i've seen some of his shows and i was kind
[2:56:53.400 --> 2:56:56.680]  of like oh look he's there exactly people are almost emotional it's about
[2:56:56.680 --> 2:56:59.640]  the establishment media but when we go out to these events like at the trump
[2:56:59.640 --> 2:57:02.680]  rally tons of people are coming up to us there and we had a lot of fans of the
[2:57:02.680 --> 2:57:06.360]  democrat deal oh tons i mean it was ridiculous the police
[2:57:06.360 --> 2:57:10.680]  in philadelphia i was walking by and this guy goes yo pigs and i looked over and
[2:57:10.680 --> 2:57:14.760]  it was uh two uh black hops on bikes and they were standing in front of the uh
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:18.040]  the wall that was there to keep people out and they're like yo man tell alex we
[2:57:18.040 --> 2:57:20.920]  said hey man we love this show man we watch you guys all the time i mean i
[2:57:20.920 --> 2:57:23.160]  don't want to get in trouble but we were cheered by the secret service like
[2:57:23.160 --> 2:57:26.360]  everywhere we went i had this really big tall guy come running at me in a
[2:57:26.360 --> 2:57:29.880]  bulletproof vest and he's got a gun in philadelphia and i was like what the
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:33.480]  hell did i do and this guy goes can i get a picture i love you guys i'm like hold
[2:57:33.480 --> 2:57:36.840]  on or what a tip it was homeland security i was like yeah sure he's like
[2:57:36.840 --> 2:57:40.280]  six foot eight and i'm like five nine and i'm sitting here like all right man
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:44.360]  this next time don't run at me so quick man i didn't know what was going on
[2:57:44.360 --> 2:57:48.680]  uh how old ptsd was like what the hell man but it's everywhere like the the
[2:57:48.680 --> 2:57:53.960]  cleveland police department just loved us i mean just responsive i mean now
[2:57:53.960 --> 2:57:58.360]  and don't don't tell people don't don't tell them anyways it's pretty ridiculous
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:58:02.440]  it's pretty ridiculous and and again that's got to worry hillary
[2:58:02.440 --> 2:58:05.800]  oh definitely i mean i've been to her rallies as well and it's
[2:58:05.800 --> 2:58:09.160]  very lackluster most of the people to go to her rallies are going
[2:58:09.160 --> 2:58:13.960]  to hear her lie in person because they just want to see that in person from
[2:58:13.960 --> 2:58:15.880]  what's in their life and i want to be clear about something we're gonna hold
[2:58:15.880 --> 2:58:19.000]  over in the next hour i think it's shard isn't be joining us from the other
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:23.400]  studio from the radio studio we're here in the tv studio but
[2:58:23.400 --> 2:58:26.040]  of course they're bad cops of course they're bad people in every group we
[2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:29.080]  want to reform some of the problems but the globalist brought into the police
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:32.280]  well here's the deal america's getting taken down by outside globalists the
[2:58:32.280 --> 2:58:35.640]  proof's coming out in emails and americans are all rallying together
[2:58:35.640 --> 2:58:38.760]  whether you're a cop a citizen black white it doesn't matter hispanic
[2:58:38.760 --> 2:58:42.680]  together to try to save this country epic history's happening

[2:59:46.680 --> 2:59:49.480]  yourself today
[2:59:49.480 --> 2:59:55.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:03.800 --> 3:00:07.560]  the world is a corrupt place because good people lay down
[3:00:07.560 --> 3:00:11.880]  and that's changing
[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:16.360]  living giant is a dangerous but because of evil
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:20.680]  but because of those who look on and do nothing
[3:00:20.680 --> 3:00:25.080]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:00:25.080 --> 3:00:29.240]  we now take you live to the central texas command center
[3:00:29.240 --> 3:00:34.520]  it's alex jones 25 years ago when i first got politically involved i would
[3:00:34.520 --> 3:00:37.800]  go speak at city council because it was on cable and people would see it i would
[3:00:37.800 --> 3:00:40.680]  go speak at the county commissioners and i would
[3:00:40.680 --> 3:00:43.800]  bring up the new world order world government
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:46.600]  i would read quotes by dev rocker fuller about destroying our sovereignty
[3:00:46.600 --> 3:00:50.200]  senator goldwater fighting back and they'd laugh at me and make jokes see
[3:00:50.200 --> 3:00:53.560]  people aren't laughing now and that's my point
[3:00:53.560 --> 3:00:56.760]  as bad as stuff is
[3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:00.760]  the police are awake because the globalists went too far with their sorrows
[3:01:00.760 --> 3:01:04.840]  plan and started saying go kill cops and stuff and the police know about how
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:08.200]  they do this in third world countries so like oh my god the worst is true
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:11.320]  the military's basically almost completely awake unless somebody's
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:14.360]  really stupid and they're in trouble showbix
[3:01:14.360 --> 3:01:18.760]  yes they are and with the military that that point being made that's very true
[3:01:18.760 --> 3:01:21.880]  you know there's a lot of soldiers that i was in with that are still in who
[3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:25.800]  watch this show religiously who watched it before i even knew the show existed
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:29.480]  back when i was in iraq in like 2014 and stuff that were watching this
[3:01:29.480 --> 3:01:31.960]  show and listening to your videos and watching your
[3:01:31.960 --> 3:01:35.080]  documentaries and i didn't even know the show existed most of them thought i
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:37.880]  was such a gung-ho soldier when was this they were scared at something like
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:42.840]  back in 2013 all the way through 2013 when i got out you know
[3:01:42.840 --> 3:01:45.960]  i never knew the show existed until after i got out with the whole hastings thing
[3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:48.520]  yeah you know but most of the soldiers wouldn't even come to me and tell me
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:51.240]  about because they thought i was such a gung-ho
[3:01:51.240 --> 3:01:54.520]  us army by the book you know Rambo type guy
[3:01:54.520 --> 3:01:57.880]  and when i got out started working here everybody just started emailing me and
[3:01:57.880 --> 3:02:01.240]  calling me like you worked for alex jones that's the most amazing show ever
[3:02:01.240 --> 3:02:04.280]  i was about to add i was about to add though that's compartmentalization
[3:02:04.280 --> 3:02:08.200]  everyone feels like they're alone we're all decompartmentalizing right now
[3:02:08.200 --> 3:02:11.720]  and realizing hey we're the majority and we're not black we're not white we're
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:14.680]  patriots i mean i did a report earlier this week on
[3:02:14.680 --> 3:02:19.640]  monday where the u.s army had a op sec brief and in the slide it listed
[3:02:19.640 --> 3:02:24.120]  hillary clinton as a security threat with her mishandling a classified materials
[3:02:24.120 --> 3:02:27.400]  along with general portray us and all that and notice they said no comment which
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:31.160]  means it's real well the story that i came out with was monday
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:34.280]  later monday night uh the army pulled the slide
[3:02:34.280 --> 3:02:37.560]  from their briefs that have been going on for almost over a year
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:42.040]  then tuesday mbc covered it then wednesday the army came out yesterday
[3:02:42.040 --> 3:02:46.360]  in army times and said that they pulled hillary oh see i didn't know i didn't
[3:02:46.360 --> 3:02:49.240]  know that but i said no that's real because when they say no comment that
[3:02:49.240 --> 3:02:51.080]  means real oh yeah it was real it was a real
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:53.640]  slide that was in circulation for about 18 months
[3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:56.840]  and the army pulled it down after the backlash from the videos well that's
[3:02:56.840 --> 3:02:59.880]  because the army is openly ignoring obama and hillary at this point because
[3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:03.080]  they're not our leaders they are foreign imposters
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:06.120]  general flinn all of them know folks i mean this is a big deal it's a it's a
[3:03:06.120 --> 3:03:09.880]  soft coup as uh pacenic and pacenic's been running
[3:03:09.880 --> 3:03:12.280]  around to the generals and stuff they've been meeting and things
[3:03:12.280 --> 3:03:15.240]  that's the people of illiciters and stuff i don't tell people a bunch of
[3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:18.920]  stuff because it's so historic so over the top
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:22.120]  that i can't even believe i'm in the middle of it but just just believe me
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:25.480]  the only reason i'm alive is the good lord above but also there's so many good
[3:03:25.480 --> 3:03:29.480]  people and agencies that i'm under full surveillance for my own safety
[3:03:29.480 --> 3:03:32.520]  i mean i've been told in the threat fusion centers and stuff everything i do
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:37.320]  is watched and that's to protect me yeah is that not crazy
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:41.480]  i believe that a hundred percent when i go and i go to do some of these reports
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:44.520]  and these police come up to us or the fbi contacts me and says hey
[3:03:44.520 --> 3:03:47.080]  we're watching you in mexico when you're going down they're looking at this
[3:03:47.080 --> 3:03:50.200]  where'd you find out it you know they're watching
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:53.480]  yeah and so i realized the scythe they would come in corrupt our government
[3:03:53.480 --> 3:03:56.520]  take it over have the government do bad stuff and then have us have a war with
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:03:59.880]  our government so they come in after no we're not doing that
[3:03:59.880 --> 3:04:03.720]  we've caught you we know your plan you are screwed sorrows
[3:04:03.720 --> 3:04:07.800]  you are screwed and i was i played along with fighting with the cops and stuff
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:11.080]  before i paradigm shifted the last decade and it's just part of getting older
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:14.200]  more sophisticated and we're all learning more faster and faster now too
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:17.880]  yeah it's not flip-flopping as you get older you start to understand the world
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:21.560]  better you start to see behind the curtain you start to uh
[3:04:21.560 --> 3:04:25.560]  understand everything clear and that's what the show does is it
[3:04:25.560 --> 3:04:29.400]  it kind of imagine being born with a pair of glasses on but they're really
[3:04:29.400 --> 3:04:32.600]  foggy and as time progresses you you start
[3:04:32.600 --> 3:04:35.160]  cleaning them off and you start to be able to see clear and clear
[3:04:35.160 --> 3:04:38.600]  and eventually you get to a point where it's all clear and you can see it
[3:04:38.600 --> 3:04:41.320]  and it's scary but it's like you're driving through the mountains and you
[3:04:41.320 --> 3:04:43.800]  go through the cloud cover all of a sudden you're up above the clouds you
[3:04:43.800 --> 3:04:46.360]  see the the blue sky and the mountains of the moon rising
[3:04:46.360 --> 3:04:49.320]  you're like this is incredible yeah and that's what it's like it's just
[3:04:49.320 --> 3:04:53.560]  more and more we're just like whoa we can see for miles and miles and miles
[3:04:53.560 --> 3:04:57.160]  hundreds of miles and we're all seeing this together
[3:04:57.160 --> 3:05:02.760]  mm-hmm we're all Joe Biggs here with info wars.com Colin Kaepernick says the
[3:05:02.760 --> 3:05:05.480]  pigs on his socks were only meant to represent
[3:05:05.480 --> 3:05:09.880]  row cops Colin Kaepernick made more news Thursday when photos of him wearing
[3:05:09.880 --> 3:05:12.840]  socks with pictures of pigs dressed like police officers
[3:05:12.840 --> 3:05:18.040]  began attracting attention this is the same guy who refused to stay up during
[3:05:18.040 --> 3:05:21.240]  the national anthem the san francisco 49ers quarterback
[3:05:21.240 --> 3:05:24.840]  addressed the situation with an instagram post later in the morning
[3:05:24.840 --> 3:05:28.120]  i wore these socks in the past because the row cops that are allowed to hold
[3:05:28.120 --> 3:05:31.720]  positions in police departments not only put the community in danger but also
[3:05:31.720 --> 3:05:35.000]  put the cops that have the right intentions in danger by creating an
[3:05:35.000 --> 3:05:39.000]  environment of tension and mistrust he added that he wore the socks before he
[3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:42.520]  started sitting down during the national anthem prior to the 49ers
[3:05:42.520 --> 3:05:45.400]  pre-season games this year there is police brutality the
[3:05:45.400 --> 3:05:48.840]  quarterback said people of color have been targeted by police so that's a
[3:05:48.840 --> 3:05:52.600]  large part of it and their government officials they are put in place by the
[3:05:52.600 --> 3:05:55.960]  government so that's something that this country has to change you can find

[3:08:24.680 --> 3:08:29.000]  joe well salon that normally is promoting pedophilia
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:32.440]  how great is the lust after four-year-old girls i'm not kidding
[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:35.400]  i mean this is like something that is a running theme of these people because
[3:08:35.400 --> 3:08:39.400]  it's a war on decency we have to bring them to heal
[3:08:39.400 --> 3:08:42.600]  watch a decade of hillary clinton shameful hypocrisy
[3:08:42.600 --> 3:08:47.000]  on racism and they they make a joke out of it
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:50.520]  you know it's like what i talked about uma abedin has she had sexual mutilation
[3:08:50.520 --> 3:08:54.760]  because her parents are serious muslim scholar clerics
[3:08:54.760 --> 3:08:57.880]  and her mother promotes sharia law which means you
[3:08:57.880 --> 3:09:02.280]  cut a woman's genitals off and they had i'm not exaggerating
[3:09:02.280 --> 3:09:06.600]  at least 10 national news stories and newspapers you name it
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:10.040]  attacking me and roger stone for saying who knows does she have her genitals
[3:09:10.040 --> 3:09:13.640]  and they said oh we're obsessed with women and don't know about women
[3:09:13.640 --> 3:09:16.840]  and are digging through our sister's underwear drawer
[3:09:16.840 --> 3:09:20.280]  and these articles all kind of because i read like four or five this morning
[3:09:20.280 --> 3:09:23.160]  we're like fetishy like they kind of liked it it was like
[3:09:23.160 --> 3:09:26.920]  they were playing to their pervert readers we're like serious man
[3:09:26.920 --> 3:09:30.280]  this woman runs around these flower outfits and stays in the same hotel
[3:09:30.280 --> 3:09:32.760]  room with hillary and all this we're not saying it's bad they're lesbians
[3:09:32.760 --> 3:09:37.080]  whatever the point is is that then they support sharia law
[3:09:37.080 --> 3:09:40.760]  that would kill a lesbian that's what we're talking about media
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:44.120]  blue state all you different newspapers and publications
[3:09:44.120 --> 3:09:47.640]  not that oh we're obsessed well we are obsessed but the point is not obsessed
[3:09:47.640 --> 3:09:50.520]  like we don't know anything about it like like we're trying to discover
[3:09:50.520 --> 3:09:54.040]  something i mean give me a break these people are crazy bigs
[3:09:54.040 --> 3:10:00.760]  at stockholm syndrome they loved yes please let's support sharia law in the
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:03.640]  islamic terrace please cut my head off and they just
[3:10:03.640 --> 3:10:06.680]  say guide the guy's hand holding the blade up to their neck and they just
[3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:10.600]  love it and they're smiling and giggling and they have writers that sit there
[3:10:10.600 --> 3:10:14.760]  drooling and then showing videos of four-year-old girls
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:18.440]  i mean that was sick i saw that this guy comes out with this video
[3:10:18.440 --> 3:10:21.320]  and says he's a pedophile and he doesn't want to be looked at like he's
[3:10:21.320 --> 3:10:25.080]  inhumane or he's some bad person he's like i've never really done anything with
[3:10:25.080 --> 3:10:28.520]  a child but i do have sexual fantasies with young girls i'm
[3:10:28.520 --> 3:10:31.640]  no that's completely and totally messed up we should not be promoting that
[3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:35.800]  meanwhile the same liberal media says arrest a guy if he's 18 his girlfriend
[3:10:35.800 --> 3:10:38.760]  17 no that they should amend the statutory rape
[3:10:38.760 --> 3:10:42.120]  laws okay but when but when it's a guy going after
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:45.560]  you know your five-year-old daughter execute them
[3:10:45.560 --> 3:10:48.920]  yeah i mean you know it is just the craziest
[3:10:48.920 --> 3:10:52.760]  stuff i mean let me tell you when i was 16 i had girlfriends that were
[3:10:52.760 --> 3:10:56.840]  25 and uh that that was not statutory rape i will
[3:10:56.840 --> 3:10:59.960]  assure you i'm not trying to get grabbing it's just true
[3:10:59.960 --> 3:11:04.360]  i'm not bragging it is true i tell you what a crazy world
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:07.160]  i wish i was as good looking as i was when i was 20 though i remember when i
[3:11:07.160 --> 3:11:12.840]  used to live in Panama city beach without a ton oh my gosh well i'm sure
[3:11:12.840 --> 3:11:16.200]  here's the deal they call it perverted and they control the christian
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:18.920]  church it's not a christian i love god but i'm a man i mean god made me look
[3:11:18.920 --> 3:11:21.800]  also king david did i'm just not a hypocrite about it
[3:11:21.800 --> 3:11:26.280]  it's normal that i appreciate god's creations you know full grown women
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:29.640]  that's supposedly christians get more upset about how beautiful women are
[3:11:29.640 --> 3:11:33.480]  but then it's like the they're promoting pedophilia on the news
[3:11:33.480 --> 3:11:36.680]  and and we've allowed christians to kind of lose the moral high ground
[3:11:36.680 --> 3:11:41.240]  by getting so upset at like you know men liking women and bikinis
[3:11:41.240 --> 3:11:44.840]  you know and then going out and screaming you know god hates fags kill gay
[3:11:44.840 --> 3:11:47.880]  people to make christians you know not look loving
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:51.000]  and then meanwhile you give away your moral high ground and the pedophiles
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:53.080]  come out and take over you don't want to see do you see what i'm saying you see
[3:11:53.080 --> 3:11:55.640]  what i'm saying yeah you don't see beekeepers in the water playing around
[3:11:55.640 --> 3:11:59.160]  and swatting the water and chasing after the bee well by the way it's true that
[3:11:59.160 --> 3:12:03.240]  when they put these burkinis on in fact i had an article on that today
[3:12:03.240 --> 3:12:06.920]  if i let's pull that up we can on screen when they have these burkinis on
[3:12:06.920 --> 3:12:09.960]  that are literal teletubbie outfits that full grown women are wearing
[3:12:09.960 --> 3:12:12.600]  and they're out there at the beach the french are like the thing is they
[3:12:12.600 --> 3:12:16.520]  grandstand and bracken talks about in the next phase of islam
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:21.000]  they do this to parade around and make you uncomfortable and see they enjoy it
[3:12:21.000 --> 3:12:24.760]  they get off on it these are stockholm syndrome enslaved women
[3:12:24.760 --> 3:12:28.520]  with their genitals cut off in many cases but the inventor of the burkini
[3:12:28.520 --> 3:12:32.360]  has now come out and attacked sarkozy uh who's a bad guy by the way for
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:36.120]  supporting the burka band and said you don't get the style
[3:12:36.120 --> 3:12:39.960]  can we pull up close-ups of the burkinis please i mean not just the far away

[3:13:50.200 --> 3:13:54.680]  designer of burkinis would that make it okay i think that must be it
[3:13:54.680 --> 3:13:59.640]  and did you see that they said now if you post a picture of someone enforcing
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:02.760]  the burkini law and like writing a ticket or whatever
[3:14:02.760 --> 3:14:06.680]  they're gonna come after you legally who is it the french government
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:10.600]  have the article right here it says it truly they don't totally schizophrenic
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:14.120]  exactly they tell the newspapers okay we're gonna enforce the law that we
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:17.240]  don't want to so don't show the photo go ahead and show the article here we go
[3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:21.080]  everything is so loaded perception becomes a reality it's totally insane
[3:14:21.080 --> 3:14:24.040]  they could just say anything they want say you're racist say you're homophobic
[3:14:24.040 --> 3:14:27.240]  yeah it's it's uh from the independent i sent it to the producer it says
[3:14:27.240 --> 3:14:29.320]  yeah let's do a document cam shot we can show that there
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:33.400]  Burkini ban France threatens legal action against social media users for
[3:14:33.400 --> 3:14:37.480]  sharing photos of police enforcing law so it says i am denouncing a
[3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:41.160]  manipulation that undermines the local police and uh they're
[3:14:41.160 --> 3:14:44.040]  threatening legal action against social media users for sharing photos of
[3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:47.640]  police enforcing a ban on the burkini which is one right here it's a public
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:50.840]  place so there's no perception of privacy that's my big beef of police
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:53.880]  worldwide i get the cameras cause you problems they also help you in a lot
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:57.720]  of cases that'll help get rid of bad cops stop
[3:14:57.720 --> 3:15:00.680]  giving people tickets or arresting people that are videotaping police
[3:15:00.680 --> 3:15:04.520]  they've backed off a lot on that in the u.s that is outrageous by the french
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:07.480]  i just love the ridiculousness of all of it it's like
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:11.560]  it's completely insane just like they had the burkini only pool days
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:14.680]  well now it's like okay well we're gonna put put this policy forward but then
[3:15:14.680 --> 3:15:17.880]  the other side in germany they have pool days just for the muslims
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:21.960]  yeah exactly but now you can't even have a girl's now in germany wear wristbands
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:26.440]  and all the pools saying don't rape me in arabic and hey also the egyptian police
[3:15:26.440 --> 3:15:29.560]  i couldn't print the story because it wouldn't work the egyptian police are
[3:15:29.560 --> 3:15:34.200]  using gay and lesbian dating apps smartphone apps
[3:15:34.200 --> 3:15:37.560]  and then busting the people using them and arresting them
[3:15:37.560 --> 3:15:42.280]  and but that's okay that's fine right where was it we're bad look at all the
[3:15:42.280 --> 3:15:45.080]  actually oppressive countries actually oppressive people
[3:15:45.080 --> 3:15:48.760]  they're great and we should defend their honor in the united states though if you
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:51.640]  say something that could potentially harm someone you're a really really bad
[3:15:51.640 --> 3:15:54.280]  person like you're bad you said you're women what you meant is

[3:24:11.640 --> 3:24:14.680]  mate and you don't find a man that's totally reasonable
[3:24:14.680 --> 3:24:19.000]  like the amish and folks my issue is with the islamists this is part of a law
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:22.920]  part of being conquered part of coming in they make the women do this
[3:24:22.920 --> 3:24:25.720]  the amish let you leave in fact they push you out for a year
[3:24:25.720 --> 3:24:29.480]  and say maybe we don't want you you know when you're a teenager right at that
[3:24:29.480 --> 3:24:33.720]  time to make your decision it's not that way with the islamist
[3:24:33.720 --> 3:24:38.440]  push freedom if you want to do that then you should make that decision yourself
[3:24:38.440 --> 3:24:41.800]  and carry that out but we're not bad criticizing the barkers we have that
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:45.000]  right we're we're criticizing the fact that women are being
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:48.600]  forced to do this and many of them don't want to in iran there's a huge
[3:24:48.600 --> 3:24:52.120]  campaign campaign going on right now uh men in burkas or
[3:24:52.120 --> 3:24:55.160]  something like that as a hashtag and men are actually putting on these
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:24:57.400]  outfits and letting the women dress in regular
[3:24:57.400 --> 3:25:01.320]  conservative clothing in support of this pointing out the ridiculousness
[3:25:01.320 --> 3:25:04.920]  of this whole law in iran yeah you know we ought to have a day here people want
[3:25:04.920 --> 3:25:08.200]  to opt into it where we men all wear burkas on air
[3:25:08.200 --> 3:25:11.880]  and we just cover art and just see how it feels to be wearing a freaking halloween
[3:25:11.880 --> 3:25:14.040]  mask
[3:25:14.760 --> 3:25:18.440]  four hours of beef finally get to wear a dress
[3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:23.000]  hey uh anthony gucciardi um big's gonna ride shotgun with him because i know

[3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:29.000]  bunch of news you've gotten ready for the show with but since big's mentioned
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:32.680]  this new international policing protocol it's
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:36.440]  international our orders come from international all these alphabet groups
[3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:42.280]  run by the same globalist jote link terror attacks islam or isis protocol 12
[3:25:42.280 --> 3:25:46.200]  is beyond even what obama says which is official they when they're investigating
[3:25:46.200 --> 3:25:49.800]  a mosque they can't say mosque islam Muhammad they can't ask those
[3:25:49.800 --> 3:25:52.520]  questions actually there's like a list of 15 things
[3:25:52.520 --> 3:25:56.920]  well now global issues protocol 12 to cover up jihadist attacks in the west
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:25:59.320]  and they're just not even allowed to say it's islamic in fact they came to go
[3:25:59.320 --> 3:26:02.840]  investigate the islamic sinners because it just it isn't islamic
[3:26:02.840 --> 3:26:06.520]  isis that's the thing that has nothing to do with islam the next time there's a
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:09.000]  terror attack we should take the article to break
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:11.800]  we should take the article that breaks down all the information and black out
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:16.200]  with a sharpie any kind of word like that you know islam this and that
[3:26:16.200 --> 3:26:19.640]  and then just read it out and be like you know a man walked into a
[3:26:19.640 --> 3:26:23.160]  from a blood another 50 people were killed in turkey today in a daily
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:28.840]  suicide bombing but it has nothing to do with islam
[3:26:28.840 --> 3:26:32.920]  meanwhile you know it's really powerful to watch is the video of the women
[3:26:32.920 --> 3:26:36.280]  who were freed from the islamic state capture and whatever town they were in
[3:26:36.280 --> 3:26:39.720]  and whatever whatever country and basically isis had taken over their
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:42.520]  little town and they took off the burqas and they
[3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:46.600]  were burning them and they were crying and they were like oh my god it feels so
[3:26:46.600 --> 3:26:49.480]  amazing that's enough of your white savior crap
[3:26:49.480 --> 3:26:52.600]  okay you're a white male you're not allowed to talk shut up

[3:26:56.120 --> 3:27:00.440]  it does actually think about how many women out there despise that that want
[3:27:00.440 --> 3:27:04.200]  to be able to have that freedom to choose what they want look at these women
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:07.800]  burning these these hot hugs they've got to wear

[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:16.440]  i mean look at it it's and then then then people say well
[3:27:16.440 --> 3:27:21.560]  it's their choice completely free of the west where i felt safe

[3:28:44.200 --> 3:28:47.800]  the truth is no one's getting any orders around here that's why it's so bad
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:51.240]  and so good that's the big orders are happening around here i
[3:28:51.240 --> 3:28:54.600]  i'm told to hey what do you want to cover and go cover it
[3:28:54.600 --> 3:28:56.760]  you know if you're going to talk about something or bring up something that's
[3:28:56.760 --> 3:28:59.160]  happening in the country go shoot a report
[3:28:59.160 --> 3:29:02.600]  go talk about it give your viewpoint on it put the meanwhile other media is
[3:29:02.600 --> 3:29:05.640]  micromanaged because there's always a corporate message they want out
[3:29:05.640 --> 3:29:09.320]  yeah we literally do have more freedom here
[3:29:09.320 --> 3:29:12.120]  to cover the things we care about to cover the things we want to to cover
[3:29:12.120 --> 3:29:15.240]  these hot topics that are unfolding the breaking news
[3:29:15.240 --> 3:29:18.120]  without anyone staining over our shoulder the only one who want to randomly
[3:29:18.120 --> 3:29:22.040]  act like age tree looks you can't and just suddenly say i says that's the
[3:29:22.040 --> 3:29:25.320]  group that has literally nothing to do with islam

[3:29:41.480 --> 3:29:45.160]  to vet all that make phone calls and things but other than that

[3:29:56.840 --> 3:29:59.080]  french
[3:29:59.080 --> 3:30:03.000]  staunch anti-fetalist patrick kenry was opposed to the constitution fearing it
[3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:06.440]  would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that
[3:30:06.440 --> 3:30:10.120]  had created it but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty
[3:30:10.120 --> 3:30:14.120]  his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said you're not to
[3:30:14.120 --> 3:30:18.200]  inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to become a great
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:21.720]  and powerful people but how your liberties can be secured
[3:30:21.720 --> 3:30:24.600]  for liberty ought to be the direct end of your government
[3:30:24.600 --> 3:30:27.640]  patrick kenry warned us the liberties of a people never were
[3:30:27.640 --> 3:30:31.320]  nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be
[3:30:31.320 --> 3:30:34.600]  concealed from them today everything the government does
[3:30:34.600 --> 3:30:39.160]  at every level is concealed from us we have trade deals to manage our economy
[3:30:39.160 --> 3:30:42.040]  that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see
[3:30:42.040 --> 3:30:45.720]  later in life patrick kenry looked back and said when the american spirit was in
[3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:48.280]  its youth the language of america was different
[3:30:48.280 --> 3:30:52.520]  liberty sir was the primary object today our primary concern
[3:30:52.520 --> 3:30:55.720]  is safety and comfort when we should be demanding
[3:30:55.720 --> 3:30:58.920]  liberty grandfather wars dot com i'm david night

[3:33:26.200 --> 3:33:30.840]  we have major breaking news here as we're live on the air at 233 central
[3:33:30.840 --> 3:33:35.640]  time uh just a few minutes ago because we were getting ready to
[3:33:35.640 --> 3:33:39.720]  go to her speech as she was concluding it
[3:33:39.720 --> 3:33:44.680]  hillary clinton in this big event that that she's been talking about for so
[3:33:44.680 --> 3:33:48.600]  long where she was going to expose donald trump she came out with more
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:54.840]  half truths lies innuendo hypocrisy where we've got all these videos of her
[3:33:54.840 --> 3:33:59.480]  saying build a wall build a fence deport felons deport illegals
[3:33:59.480 --> 3:34:02.040]  she said it in the 90s she said it in the 2000s
[3:34:02.040 --> 3:34:05.880]  she said it in 2008 running against obama it's all lies about trump
[3:34:05.880 --> 3:34:12.600]  it's all twisted spin half baked bs and then she did it to me and i'm the big
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:15.640]  one you know you don't say alex jones
[3:34:15.640 --> 3:34:20.040]  you never say the name alex jones they always say the one from texas
[3:34:20.040 --> 3:34:23.240]  which is so honorable i'm known as the texan thank god
[3:34:23.240 --> 3:34:26.760]  that's right slime and we're here standing against you we don't care
[3:34:26.760 --> 3:34:31.080]  we're committed but more and more they have to speak
[3:34:31.080 --> 3:34:36.520]  the name that no one says it's like in lord of the rings he says sorrow money
[3:34:36.520 --> 3:34:42.040]  sorrow i mean they will not even speak it i love it
[3:34:42.040 --> 3:34:45.560]  that they won't speak my name in fact this bums me out
[3:34:45.560 --> 3:34:50.120]  that that hillary the arch criminal is actually speaking my name it loses
[3:34:50.120 --> 3:34:53.880]  some of the mystique uh to be the you know unspoken one but let me get serious
[3:34:53.880 --> 3:34:58.840]  because i'm going to respond to this live here on air right now
[3:34:58.840 --> 3:35:03.000]  hillary clinton just minutes ago concluded while we were live on air
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:07.080]  at 235 currently hillary clinton just concluded her
[3:35:07.080 --> 3:35:14.040]  live speech where she was going to destroy the kkk kingpin donald trump
[3:35:14.040 --> 3:35:17.960]  the problem is we have her saying one of her main mentors
[3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:21.400]  was senator robert bird who was a grand dragon
[3:35:21.400 --> 3:35:24.920]  and supreme cyclops and all these other stupid
[3:35:24.920 --> 3:35:28.680]  comic book names the kkk has for themselves bedsheets
[3:35:28.680 --> 3:35:32.200]  it's really weird it's it's a it's a gang you think just black people in
[3:35:32.200 --> 3:35:36.280]  mexicans or whatever have gangs the kkk is a white gang okay of
[3:35:36.280 --> 3:35:39.240]  degenerates i mean everybody's got their own degenerates and that's what's
[3:35:39.240 --> 3:35:42.840]  going on so trump has disavowed over and over again
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:45.080]  she goes into that she goes into everything else
[3:35:45.080 --> 3:35:48.360]  she's saying shut down bright bart i mean these are open statements
[3:35:48.360 --> 3:35:52.280]  very dangerous tyranny and she goes on to say
[3:35:52.280 --> 3:35:55.800]  it's what happens when you listen to the radio host alex jones
[3:35:55.800 --> 3:35:59.800]  who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs
[3:35:59.800 --> 3:36:03.560]  he said the victims of the sandy hook massacre were child actors
[3:36:03.560 --> 3:36:06.920]  and no one was actually killed there now let's stop right there
[3:36:06.920 --> 3:36:11.080]  because that's lies and twisted disinformation
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:16.120]  i said the saudi arabian government helped fund
[3:36:16.120 --> 3:36:20.520]  15 of the 19 hijackers and i said that there was a congressional
[3:36:20.520 --> 3:36:26.440]  investigation in 2002 that found that saudi arabia
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:30.520]  quarterback to 9-11 attacks and that bipartisanly
[3:36:30.520 --> 3:36:33.560]  high levels of the government blocked that investigation
[3:36:33.560 --> 3:36:38.440]  and blocked the fbi for even stopping uh the hijackers before it happened
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:42.200]  because of the saudi connection and they basically stood down
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:46.040]  now i was interviewing the whistleblowers
[3:36:46.040 --> 3:36:52.040]  and fbi people back in 2002 345 i was having members of the cfr on and
[3:36:52.040 --> 3:36:55.800]  others high level former spy chiefs like dr pacenic i mean
[3:36:55.800 --> 3:37:00.440]  i had my sources but it was in the news that saudi arabia was involved
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:04.440]  it just came back up with 28 pages and has been proven correct so
[3:37:04.440 --> 3:37:08.440]  they condensed it down to like a warner brothers cartoon
[3:37:08.440 --> 3:37:12.440]  where i'm saying george w bush had the plunger blowing up the buildings in
[3:37:12.440 --> 3:37:16.120]  fact that's what hardball always says jones says bush literally had a
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:20.200]  detonator and and and like wiley coyote blew it up that's what they say
[3:37:20.200 --> 3:37:24.840]  i didn't get that analogy for myself they say that i didn't say that
[3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:28.200]  i said bush was literally not even like the president was dick cheney it was
[3:37:28.200 --> 3:37:31.240]  much more sophisticated than that and it's all come out now let's talk about
[3:37:31.240 --> 3:37:34.680]  oklahoma city let's let's talk about oklahoma city
[3:37:34.680 --> 3:37:41.640]  oklahoma city was a total false flag with nato
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:48.200]  the atf and the cia and the fbi and we know the names of the men from the
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:51.800]  witnesses in the building from the police officers
[3:37:51.800 --> 3:37:55.640]  and from the declassified information that came out
[3:37:55.640 --> 3:37:58.600]  the bombs in the building general part in the former head of air force weapons
[3:37:58.600 --> 3:38:02.360]  he went public about the bombs being inside the outside being in diversion
[3:38:02.360 --> 3:38:09.160]  it goes on and on and on and so yes that was a false flag and you ask why do
[3:38:09.160 --> 3:38:12.760]  they use foreign agencies that way they're all involved nobody can blackmail
[3:38:12.760 --> 3:38:15.240]  the others and it's been declassified the
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:18.200]  london guardians reported the germans have been caught doing bombings
[3:38:18.200 --> 3:38:22.520]  to blame right wing ribs as well as a national program in the 90s
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:25.800]  they also the british got caught leading the ira they actually led it from the
[3:38:25.800 --> 3:38:28.920]  top the ira didn't even know for decades and it was the british government
[3:38:28.920 --> 3:38:32.760]  ordering the ira to bomb to discredit the ira that is london guardian
[3:38:32.760 --> 3:38:35.960]  associated press bbc look at it for yourself so
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:39.400]  yes i do say that was a false flag completely there's different types of
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:44.200]  false flags and then they say that i say sandy hook massacre
[3:38:44.200 --> 3:38:49.960]  that none of it happened there have been top school safety experts that have
[3:38:49.960 --> 3:38:53.160]  come out and said that it's a cover-up there have been major anomalies like
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:57.160]  anderson cooper using blue screen when he's not really at sandy hook
[3:38:57.160 --> 3:38:59.960]  and we've seen CNN claiming that they were in
[3:38:59.960 --> 3:39:03.320]  riyadh under scut attack when they weren't remember that's famous
[3:39:03.320 --> 3:39:07.880]  i just said it should be investigated clearly the whole story doesn't add up
[3:39:07.880 --> 3:39:12.200]  some people say it's old child actors some people say all this
[3:39:12.200 --> 3:39:16.360]  that's not what i'm saying there was a drill that day a lot of weird stuff went
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:21.000]  on so that's what i'm getting at here now joe bigs was in here live in studio
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:23.640]  breaking down other news with us we're gonna go back to him in a moment and
[3:39:23.640 --> 3:39:26.920]  anthony gociardi but i wanted to go ahead now that we
[3:39:26.920 --> 3:39:29.720]  have the clip and play uh hillary clinton now
[3:39:29.720 --> 3:39:33.800]  planning to use alex jones as an attack on trump
[3:39:33.800 --> 3:39:37.240]  uh and again this is meant to have him not use
[3:39:37.240 --> 3:39:41.000]  key ammo against hillary like hey there might be election fraud
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:43.720]  well now the un's coming to oversee the election saying there's gonna be election
[3:39:43.720 --> 3:39:47.240]  fraud trump's been proven right again we're covering real things and she
[3:39:47.240 --> 3:39:50.200]  wants to illustrate this and act like she's not
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:53.800]  right she's scared of the alternative right news that's what she's going after
[3:39:53.800 --> 3:39:57.000]  she thinks that us being out here exposing all this you know
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:39:59.720]  she's trying to push this whole conspiracy thing to take away from the
[3:39:59.720 --> 3:40:04.520]  fact that we really are exposing criminal activity that's going on this
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:07.960]  well sure and they misrepresent i mean the truth is i'm proud that i said there
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:10.760]  was something going on 9 11 including the dust and they now admit it was
[3:40:10.760 --> 3:40:14.680]  deadly and they covered it up i was right about that i mean this is common sense
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:18.760]  oklahoma city was totally a false flag world net daily
[3:40:18.760 --> 3:40:23.480]  got the hotel receipts of the head of the fbi hostage rescue team there days
[3:40:23.480 --> 3:40:27.160]  before at at at you know the hotel and his whole
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:30.520]  team he said he was in dallas and didn't get there till that afternoon i mean we
[3:40:30.520 --> 3:40:32.840]  have it we have the witnesses that saw him
[3:40:32.840 --> 3:40:36.440]  identified him on tv these guys were crazy enough to go plant bombs in the
[3:40:36.440 --> 3:40:41.080]  building and then go to press conferences at the bomb site
[3:40:41.080 --> 3:40:43.560]  and the people that were working in the federal building were like that's the
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:47.320]  guy planting the bombs i've had all the witnesses on jane
[3:40:47.320 --> 3:40:51.240]  graham all of them you know that i've had the cops on the ones they didn't kill
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:54.520]  and torture to death and you know it's right on the show then
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:40:58.040]  within 10 minutes local homo city bombing who did hitlery
[3:40:58.040 --> 3:41:01.960]  and bill clinton blame rush limbaugh and talk radio and then later
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:06.680]  you know matt drudge everybody uh they're coming out of the press folks
[3:41:06.680 --> 3:41:09.800]  and they're scared of us so they want to have this fake moral authority
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:12.920]  like they're up there on the high mountain going and he talks to the kook
[3:41:12.920 --> 3:41:17.000]  alex jones and in the desert he goes to an oasis and drinks good
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:21.320]  water what a kook i mean this is see these people but see that's why
[3:41:21.320 --> 3:41:24.440]  they admit now they want to censor us and that's why they said breitbart and
[3:41:24.440 --> 3:41:29.000]  other uh grassroots conservative media has no right to exist
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:34.520]  because we're kicking your butt with the information because it's the internet
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:37.880]  age we can show you say build a wall 15 times
[3:41:37.880 --> 3:41:41.400]  and then say trump's a bigot because he wants to build a wall
[3:41:41.400 --> 3:41:47.320]  we can show what a fraud you are lady by the way she looked like hell like she
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:50.040]  was propped up during this press conference here it is
[3:41:50.040 --> 3:41:57.640]  there she is hard cleaning assassination now perhaps in trump's mind
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:02.600]  because mr cruz was a cuban immigrant he must have had something to do with it
[3:42:02.600 --> 3:42:04.680]  let's hit pause and there is let's hit pause
[3:42:04.680 --> 3:42:07.880]  no his dad lived there his dad was connected to serious organizations and
[3:42:07.880 --> 3:42:11.400]  groups uh and you notice his dad the whole thing
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:15.320]  got dropped a day later see all of it is alive see we consider analyze all of it
[3:42:15.320 --> 3:42:17.880]  all of it is alive now he doesn't like immigrants
[3:42:17.880 --> 3:42:21.560]  because ted cruz uh uh came from immigrants
[3:42:21.560 --> 3:42:27.160]  no we have the intel and we have the girlfriend of lee harvey oswald who was
[3:42:27.160 --> 3:42:31.000]  cia saying no i knew cruz and then he's in photos
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:35.000]  he's a very distinctive looking guy it looks like rafael cruz and let me
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:39.720]  explain something most of the cubans that came in
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:43.800]  in the year before all that stuff kicked off that's when cruz came in
[3:42:43.800 --> 3:42:47.640]  we're working for the cia the cia is bigger than wall mart
[3:42:47.640 --> 3:42:51.560]  and coca-cola combined okay i go to family reunions i'm even proud of it
[3:42:51.560 --> 3:42:55.720]  because i built everything myself okay it's not cool to be in the cia
[3:42:55.720 --> 3:43:00.360]  okay and i and my family it's not like analysts and people and pencil pushers
[3:43:00.360 --> 3:43:04.200]  it's like the legion of doom with eye patches okay and i'm not even proud of
[3:43:04.200 --> 3:43:07.320]  that the point is is that i know cia when i see it
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:12.360]  and that's rafael cruz go ahead yeah i mean she's doing everything she can to
[3:43:12.360 --> 3:43:16.280]  divert the attention away from the emails to divert the attention away from
[3:43:16.280 --> 3:43:19.080]  her failing health and she's trying to use this
[3:43:19.080 --> 3:43:23.000]  to to blame you to blame drudge to blame
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:27.080]  right bart and it's completely and totally pathetic we have stacks and stacks
[3:43:27.080 --> 3:43:30.760]  of paper every day showing the criminality behind the clinton
[3:43:30.760 --> 3:43:33.720]  foundation showing her failing health showing that she
[3:43:33.720 --> 3:43:37.640]  doesn't have the ability to hold the highest office that we have
[3:43:37.640 --> 3:43:41.800]  in the u.s as president and she wants to attack you that's like
[3:43:41.800 --> 3:43:45.240]  it's such a low blow well look look because they're scared of the info
[3:43:45.240 --> 3:43:48.280]  they're they're reverse psychology and patinical agree with us he's
[3:43:48.280 --> 3:43:50.840]  former top scyops the state department i'm gonna get him on tomorrow if you can
[3:43:50.840 --> 3:43:54.600]  come on let's get him on is is that whatever they're really afraid of
[3:43:54.600 --> 3:43:58.200]  they put out there like it's been discredited it's a jedi mind trick you
[3:43:58.200 --> 3:44:00.760]  understand yeah but trump sees all that and is
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:03.720]  countermanding his staff continually and that i can say that
[3:44:03.720 --> 3:44:07.160]  i mean look trump is on board the problem is it's hard to find people
[3:44:07.160 --> 3:44:10.600]  at that level for the political class that aren't you know idiots
[3:44:10.600 --> 3:44:14.680]  okay but but let's let's i'm sorry i i digress with her talking about ted
[3:44:14.680 --> 3:44:18.920]  cruz because every line is just a load of disinformation see it took me five
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:22.200]  minutes just to decipher that steaming pile of horsemen are
[3:44:22.200 --> 3:44:27.560]  let's go back to the source of the deception the creature known as hillary
[3:44:27.560 --> 3:44:32.600]  of that just recently trump claimed that president obama
[3:44:32.600 --> 3:44:38.120]  founded isis he said you did too and he has repeated that over and over again
[3:44:38.120 --> 3:44:43.560]  because you did winch his latest paranoid fever dream
[3:44:43.560 --> 3:44:49.960]  is about my health and the giant diaper you're wearing
[3:44:49.960 --> 3:44:54.360]  and all i could say is donald dream on
[3:44:54.360 --> 3:44:59.080]  dream on i see six you're taking naps for the last three days
[3:44:59.080 --> 3:45:02.840]  look at that barracuda man look at that demon
[3:45:02.840 --> 3:45:09.400]  man i hope man i can handle her whoo look at the bags under eyes the next uh
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:12.920]  bag he could literally starve the new batman as a joker no makeup needed
[3:45:12.920 --> 3:45:16.920]  but my friends this is what happens when you treat the
[3:45:16.920 --> 3:45:25.320]  national inquirer like gospel they said in october i'd be dead in six months
[3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:28.840]  it's also what happens when you listen to the radio host
[3:45:28.840 --> 3:45:35.160]  alex jones who claims that 9 11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside
[3:45:35.160 --> 3:45:41.080]  jobs he even said and this really just is so
[3:45:41.080 --> 3:45:45.560]  disgusting he even said the victims of the sandy
[3:45:45.560 --> 3:45:49.880]  hook massacre were child actors and no one
[3:45:49.880 --> 3:45:55.080]  was actually killed there i don't know what happens in somebody's mind
[3:45:55.080 --> 3:45:59.880]  she's such a liar dark their heart must be wow
[3:45:59.880 --> 3:46:03.800]  to say things like that how dark my heart must be but trump doesn't challenge
[3:46:03.800 --> 3:46:07.080]  these lies he actually went on jones's show and said
[3:46:07.080 --> 3:46:12.200]  empires never seen such giant reputation is amazing i will not let you down

[3:48:49.480 --> 3:48:52.840]  that murdered hundreds of thousands of christians with her co-founder
[3:48:52.840 --> 3:48:56.040]  at the legion of dem obama these horrible demons
[3:48:56.040 --> 3:49:01.400]  and she's talking about my black heart it's my heart is so big and red and
[3:49:01.400 --> 3:49:05.560]  juicy i do this for love lady i don't do this
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:10.280]  to count a bunch of 30 000 a person per plate to come hang out with her
[3:49:10.280 --> 3:49:14.760]  oh my god if it's not that i'm being recognized by them i mean
[3:49:14.760 --> 3:49:19.080]  they run media matters that attacks me every day no they attack me all over the
[3:49:19.080 --> 3:49:25.160]  cnn msnbc but to have the demon itself try to turn info wars into some weapon
[3:49:25.160 --> 3:49:29.640]  that's going to bring down uh trump when of course trumps winning by a landslide
[3:49:29.640 --> 3:49:32.200]  they are panicking they are completely freaking out
[3:49:32.200 --> 3:49:37.960]  okay do we have the dvr q'd up now here we go here it is
[3:49:39.400 --> 3:49:43.240]  and he has repeated that over and over again
[3:49:43.240 --> 3:49:49.720]  his latest paranoid fever dream is about my health
[3:49:49.720 --> 3:49:53.400]  yeah i must get the break this will be a day long remember
[3:49:53.400 --> 3:49:56.680]  and all i could say is donald dream on
[3:49:56.680 --> 3:50:01.080]  young got that smile she looks like family members of mine after they've been
[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:04.680]  dead a couple days lying on the slab those gums are coming back off those
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:07.480]  teeth aren't they sweetie that soul wants to get out of there
[3:50:07.480 --> 3:50:10.200]  my friends
[3:50:10.520 --> 3:50:14.120]  yeah i've got so much energy and just power surging
[3:50:14.120 --> 3:50:17.160]  i love god i love sun i'm just gonna run up to her and give her an injection
[3:50:17.160 --> 3:50:20.920]  here we go this is what happens when you treat the national
[3:50:20.920 --> 3:50:24.360]  inquirer like gospel oh that said your husband was monocloniske
[3:50:24.360 --> 3:50:27.400]  they said in october i'd be dead in six months
[3:50:27.400 --> 3:50:31.720]  and you look like you are it's also what happens when you listen to the radio
[3:50:31.720 --> 3:50:36.200]  host alex jones who claims that 9 11 and the
[3:50:36.200 --> 3:50:42.840]  oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs he even said
[3:50:42.840 --> 3:50:49.320]  and this really just is so disgusting he even said the victims of the sandy hook
[3:50:49.320 --> 3:50:56.280]  massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there i don't know
[3:50:56.280 --> 3:51:01.080]  what happens in somebody's mind or how i don't know how'd you say that i just
[3:51:01.080 --> 3:51:05.640]  didn't call those christians i don't know to say things i didn't say that
[3:51:05.640 --> 3:51:11.560]  but trump doesn't challenge wise he actually went on jones's show and said
[3:51:11.560 --> 3:51:16.120]  your reputation is amazing i will not let you down
[3:51:16.120 --> 3:51:21.800]  i hate that it's from the man who wants to be president of the united states
[3:51:21.800 --> 3:51:25.640]  you know i've stood by president obama's side as he made the toughest
[3:51:25.640 --> 3:51:30.520]  decisions a commander-in-chief has to make when she said my name so people
[3:51:30.520 --> 3:51:34.520]  shared our country depends on steady leadership
[3:51:34.520 --> 3:51:38.200]  clear thinking you don't look too steady lady because one wrong she said she
[3:51:38.200 --> 3:51:41.080]  needed a Parkinson's drug she couldn't think clearly we have your email
[3:51:41.080 --> 3:51:47.240]  wench and more i know i mean you can stop getting of us
[3:51:47.240 --> 3:51:50.200]  she said she had a crack
[3:51:50.200 --> 3:51:53.560]  oh this is so good
[3:51:53.560 --> 3:51:57.800]  tell the difference or doesn't care between
[3:51:57.800 --> 3:52:02.520]  fact and fiction and who buys so easily into racially
[3:52:02.520 --> 3:52:09.560]  tinned rumors i have to wait for this i loved
[3:52:09.560 --> 3:52:14.280]  someone so detached from reality should never be in charge of making
[3:52:14.280 --> 3:52:19.960]  decisions that are coming i'm serious oh my god this is so good
[3:52:19.960 --> 3:52:24.760]  that is yet another reason why donald's look at her she's a sack of BS
[3:52:24.760 --> 3:52:29.080]  unfit to be president of the united states
[3:52:31.960 --> 3:52:37.480]  now i i hear and i read some people who are saying well
[3:52:37.480 --> 3:52:42.840]  his bluster and his bigotry is just over the campaign rhetoric
[3:52:42.840 --> 3:52:47.000]  an outrageous person saying outrageous things for it i realize her spirit is
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:49.960]  so weak and i don't care what they do to me i'm with the spirit that's good i
[3:52:49.960 --> 3:52:52.600]  love it oh it's so good trump has proposed
[3:52:52.600 --> 3:52:56.520]  she says trump's detached from reality into practice
[3:52:56.520 --> 3:52:59.960]  and don't be distracted by our enemy that's what they say in the bible and the
[3:52:59.960 --> 3:53:02.440]  devil's locked up for a thousand years so i'm gonna look at him
[3:53:02.440 --> 3:53:07.400]  nobody's gonna say this and all that but we know where he stands
[3:53:07.400 --> 3:53:11.000]  he would form a deportation force to round up millions
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:13.880]  of immigrants and kick them out of the country
[3:53:13.880 --> 3:53:17.320]  he didn't kick them out of the country just like their countries do
[3:53:17.320 --> 3:53:20.440]  that says if you're born in the united states you're an american
[3:53:20.440 --> 3:53:23.640]  hey can we we got to take this clip and go back when she used to say the
[3:53:23.640 --> 3:53:26.840]  opposite exactly oh my god she's targeting low
[3:53:26.840 --> 3:53:30.440]  information people man millions of them
[3:53:30.440 --> 3:53:34.040]  he's bad muslims around the world let's turn it off right now
[3:53:34.040 --> 3:53:37.000]  i can't i can't think of shardy do you want to pop in here i'm sorry i have
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:40.120]  this is i feel five years younger though this is like a
[3:53:40.120 --> 3:53:43.160]  they're into blood transfusions to children i'm just into this yesterday paul
[3:53:43.160 --> 3:53:45.720]  was tweeting out wonder if hillary clinton will even mention this in
[3:53:45.720 --> 3:53:50.200]  tomorrow's alt-right speech and sure enough here you go well i'll tell you
[3:53:50.200 --> 3:53:53.720]  what number one the death star is orbiting the planet
[3:53:53.720 --> 3:53:57.720]  the death star is orbiting the planet ready to fire congratulations
[3:53:57.720 --> 3:54:02.440]  because this means that they have tried all other options of ignoring you and
[3:54:02.440 --> 3:54:05.320]  everything you're doing now they're gonna actually approach the crack and
[3:54:05.320 --> 3:54:08.680]  now they are issuing the sauron statement
[3:54:08.680 --> 3:54:12.520]  voldemort the one who will not be named because people will google you and i
[3:54:12.520 --> 3:54:14.520]  bet you look at the trends right now it's just
[3:54:14.520 --> 3:54:18.360]  crazy and people are going to the website and also though
[3:54:18.360 --> 3:54:22.600]  we have been just like hemlock check this out though
[3:54:22.600 --> 3:54:27.560]  we are debating her points she can't debate our points so she's taking things
[3:54:27.560 --> 3:54:31.720]  you didn't even say 15 years ago skewing them and then putting that up right
[3:54:31.720 --> 3:54:34.840]  so and now everyone will hear what i really said and agree with you exactly
[3:54:34.840 --> 3:54:37.880]  you need to challenge hillary i mean anisea cubers up there with his face
[3:54:37.880 --> 3:54:41.480]  disappearing at sandy hook with his i'm like what the hell is this you have to
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:44.680]  do a breakdown in a thorough and analysis of this you should do a response
[3:54:44.680 --> 3:54:48.360]  and challenge her to talk about all the things that you brought up instead of
[3:54:48.360 --> 3:54:52.360]  attacking you with adhaman and bs from 15 year old twisted statements
[3:54:52.360 --> 3:54:55.240]  if she actually could defend one thing you said
[3:54:55.240 --> 3:54:58.920]  she would but she can't so she has to use her she's giving talking points to the
[3:54:58.920 --> 3:55:02.680]  media of what to go out and say i said of course exactly well it's like i said
[3:55:02.680 --> 3:55:06.600]  that she has a tumor the size of a watermelon and i said it was a joke
[3:55:06.600 --> 3:55:09.560]  i said they're lying and saying trumps behind the poles and dropping out
[3:55:09.560 --> 3:55:13.080]  you know it's not true like it's not true if i say she has a
[3:55:13.080 --> 3:55:16.360]  tumor the size of a watermelon and then they had articles saying jones says
[3:55:16.360 --> 3:55:20.600]  she has a giant brain tumor i mean these people are just complete jokes well
[3:55:20.600 --> 3:55:23.800]  what happens if they can actually argue with the real stuff you say
[3:55:23.800 --> 3:55:27.320]  they have to say that you you know they'll take a picture of a view doing a funny
[3:55:27.320 --> 3:55:30.520]  face or something it's just standard well the same thing when they also do this i
[3:55:30.520 --> 3:55:32.760]  see media say jones has nazi stuff behind him
[3:55:32.760 --> 3:55:36.440]  it's obama care next to hitler a bunch of anthony back up
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:40.360]  saying that's bad but see that's that's what they do yeah of course because they
[3:55:40.360 --> 3:55:43.640]  can't actually argue with your they can never even actually have a discussion
[3:55:43.640 --> 3:55:47.240]  did you hear that? yeah it was the same thing when we go
[3:55:47.240 --> 3:55:50.040]  debate these social justice warriors at these events
[3:55:50.040 --> 3:55:52.920]  they never have anything to say but all they can do is say sexist race is
[3:55:52.920 --> 3:55:55.640]  lomaphobic transphobic and that's all they have
[3:55:55.640 --> 3:55:59.320]  and all they can say against you is they go oh alex jones a conspiracy theorist
[3:55:59.320 --> 3:56:02.120]  but they won't actually you said who's out of shows they go we don't know we
[3:56:02.120 --> 3:56:04.600]  were told by the people that paid us to be here
[3:56:04.600 --> 3:56:08.040]  but look they're so dumb they're stuck in the old system she's like frank
[3:56:08.040 --> 3:56:11.240]  underwood from house of cards she's like an 80s politician she doesn't
[3:56:11.240 --> 3:56:15.080]  understand the strison effect she attacking you is
[3:56:15.080 --> 3:56:18.120]  going to make you bigger and stronger help me i'm weak right
[3:56:18.120 --> 3:56:21.560]  and then you're going to actually come back with more content delivered to her
[3:56:21.560 --> 3:56:23.800]  and all the people that are googling you
[3:56:23.800 --> 3:56:26.840]  from her side saying who is this global person they're going to say wow
[3:56:26.840 --> 3:56:31.080]  actually all of this makes sense so it's 100% a victory major success
[3:56:31.080 --> 3:56:34.680]  she doesn't understand that those weighted words have no actual weight
[3:56:34.680 --> 3:56:38.600]  it's all just weird things where she thinks she can say conspiracy
[3:56:38.600 --> 3:56:42.600]  bad person she looks worse than ever man she looks drugged up she looks
[3:56:42.600 --> 3:56:46.040]  she looks like a corpse they're propping up she thinks that everyone who follows her
[3:56:46.040 --> 3:56:49.240]  is so dumb they're not going to look at it you know those NBA players come off
[3:56:49.240 --> 3:56:51.960]  the court and everyone's like high-fiving them she's going through and they're
[3:56:51.960 --> 3:56:55.640]  just jabbing her with shots to kind of boost her up so she can get to the stage
[3:56:55.640 --> 3:56:58.840]  so she's like all right we don't see an iron maiden of needles she's an iron
[3:56:58.840 --> 3:57:01.480]  maiden like 50 needles it's like when you go through basic
[3:57:01.480 --> 3:57:04.040]  trading or whatever it was just like this like a mars attacks when the
[3:57:04.040 --> 3:57:07.320]  martians jump up they have to think slam on them with their uniforms like
[3:57:07.320 --> 3:57:10.120]  she starts off on a she starts up on a stool and they just give her enough
[3:57:10.120 --> 3:57:14.680]  injections or she can finally stand up take the pillows away let's go
[3:57:14.680 --> 3:57:18.200]  they just say alex jones a bunch of times that she gets so mad that she's able
[3:57:18.200 --> 3:57:21.160]  to finally have some energy and go on stage
[3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:24.120]  you're right web traffic is three times more than normal but but see here's an
[3:57:24.120 --> 3:57:27.800]  example what was it where it was like 15 times
[3:57:27.800 --> 3:57:32.280]  it's record or something that's when there's like a mass shooting or a bombing
[3:57:32.280 --> 3:57:35.720]  people tune in for us that's what she's not even that big people tune in to hear
[3:57:35.720 --> 3:57:41.400]  what we have to say about an event this is it alex jones triggered hillary
[3:57:41.400 --> 3:57:45.720]  clinton there you go oh you know you get a thug life
[3:57:45.720 --> 3:57:49.480]  where's your trigger yeah big said good he triggered
[3:57:49.480 --> 3:57:52.760]  like immigrant over you triggered hillary clinton i think that deserves the
[3:57:52.760 --> 3:57:56.440]  thug life category well we can do a payday with this
[3:57:56.440 --> 3:57:59.800]  because we can show like the news when saudi arabia involved government stood
[3:57:59.800 --> 3:58:03.720]  down like abc news and then cut to me like 10 years ago saying it and they
[3:58:03.720 --> 3:58:07.320]  cut hillary going he says 9 11 and then and then like experts say there were
[3:58:07.320 --> 3:58:10.920]  bombs inside the building on the city they cut to me he said oklahoma triggered
[3:58:10.920 --> 3:58:13.480]  and then it just goes down the line all right we're out of time what difference
[3:58:13.480 --> 3:58:16.600]  does it make support us purchase the products we're independent media
[3:58:16.600 --> 3:58:20.200]  we don't have globalist funding us just like trump doesn't uh the new selenium
