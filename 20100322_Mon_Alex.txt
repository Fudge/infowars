[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:33.120]  Monday the 22nd day of March 2010 the behemoth government power grab known as
[00:33.120 --> 00:38.920]  Obamacare has passed the house it is now a formality to leave the Senate and go
[00:38.920 --> 00:44.660]  to the president's desk sometime this week we are going to open the phones up
[00:44.660 --> 00:51.400]  specifically for listeners to talk about points in the plan they like I would
[00:51.400 --> 00:55.320]  imagine those folks haven't actually read the bill they'll just regurgitate
[00:55.320 --> 00:59.720]  talking points that they heard the media the control corporate media and the
[00:59.720 --> 01:04.640]  Democrats spew you're welcome to call in about what you like in it or what you
[01:04.640 --> 01:09.240]  don't like what what you think is most dangerous not just about the bill but the
[01:09.240 --> 01:15.120]  way it was passed and 38 states lining up to sue to try to block it it is
[01:15.120 --> 01:21.360]  unbelievably unconstitutional amazingly illegal we're going to be going over
[01:21.360 --> 01:29.560]  every stinking facet of it today folks need to stay angry and get truly
[01:29.560 --> 01:34.160]  educated on what's happening because the establishment knows it's going to take
[01:34.160 --> 01:40.440]  a few years for any of this to be phased in the taxes will hit right away all
[01:40.440 --> 01:45.120]  the different taxes and fines and fees and the IRS grabbing your bank account
[01:45.120 --> 01:52.960]  or your paycheck or your tax return 16,500 20,000 they're debating new IRS
[01:52.960 --> 01:58.600]  enforcers now running your life involved in everything you do setting the
[01:58.600 --> 02:04.240]  precedent to make you buy private insurance and that's only the beginning
[02:04.240 --> 02:08.920]  the sky is the limit here but this is not socialism socialism is bad enough
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.680]  this is highway robbery that's why I've had more time to read over the final
[02:13.680 --> 02:19.480]  bill 2,700 pages I've just scanned it with keyword searches and I have a
[02:19.480 --> 02:23.480]  correction to make because the media been lying saying that it started
[02:23.480 --> 02:28.280]  becoming phased in in 2013 three years from now and then fully phased in
[02:28.280 --> 02:34.440]  2015 five years from now I'm sorry much of the bill the so-called benefits
[02:34.440 --> 02:40.520]  don't hit for seven and a half plus years till 2018 and and now they're
[02:40.520 --> 02:45.360]  saying oh well you might not actually get free health care this will just
[02:45.360 --> 02:52.160]  expand Medicare and Medicaid but then cut the amount of services you get
[02:52.160 --> 02:58.640]  under it so it raises taxes and cuts benefits and that's why Howard Dean at
[02:58.640 --> 03:02.720]  Inniska Senate should have been against it they wanted real socialism this is
[03:02.720 --> 03:05.760]  just like the bank or bailout where they say oh we need all these trillions of
[03:05.760 --> 03:13.000]  dollars to unfreeze the housing market on October 3rd 2008 on October 4th they
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.920]  said guess what we're not spending it on that and we're not going to tell you
[03:15.920 --> 03:22.720]  where we are spending it and we have seen seamless political integration from
[03:22.720 --> 03:29.560]  Bush to Obama in the banking theft that's going on so basically this is
[03:29.560 --> 03:35.120]  just the government passing a health care bill to grab another large percentage
[03:35.120 --> 03:40.360]  of the economy on top of grabbing the auto industry the greenhouse gas tax
[03:40.360 --> 03:46.040]  home inspections property controls that the Senate won't pass so Obama's just
[03:46.040 --> 03:51.400]  implementing it by executive fiat that's grabbing much of the economy this is a
[03:51.400 --> 03:55.400]  controlled economy where they can selectively enforce on whoever they
[03:55.400 --> 03:59.040]  want that's another discriminatory issue a bunch of different large labor
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.040]  unions and other groups they get to keep their so-called Cadillac health care
[04:03.040 --> 04:08.360]  which just means that basically all medical procedures are covered and you
[04:08.360 --> 04:16.000]  don't have to pay a deductible and so select groups they're not going to be
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.840]  penalized but the general public it will and small businesses will and so
[04:20.840 --> 04:25.480]  small businesses the biggest employer in this country will just let employees go
[04:25.480 --> 04:32.520]  and keep a skeleton crew and then give them insurance but also cut their pay
[04:32.520 --> 04:38.200]  check so and then it'll be watered down health care and it's all here in the
[04:38.200 --> 04:42.480]  fine print we're gonna go over it but I had a caller yesterday near the end of
[04:42.480 --> 04:48.680]  the broadcast the Sunday show who said Alex explain this to me how are the
[04:48.680 --> 04:52.840]  insurance companies benefiting from this how are the insurance companies behind

[08:25.720 --> 08:31.760]  infamy the federal government controlled by criminal offshore banks and
[08:31.760 --> 08:37.880]  corporations greedy for more revenue streams as sees control depending on
[08:37.880 --> 08:44.760]  what numbers you look at at 16 to 20% of the U.S. economy they already have much
[08:44.760 --> 08:48.760]  of the auto industry under their environmental initiative they are
[08:48.760 --> 08:56.400]  taking control of all industry power plants production farms ranches the
[08:56.400 --> 08:59.960]  federal government has passed in the house and is very close in the Senate
[08:59.960 --> 09:03.560]  to passing the cyber security bill that allows the president and the federal
[09:03.560 --> 09:08.400]  government unilaterally to shut down the web completely or restrict and censor
[09:08.400 --> 09:14.880]  and tax the web in any way they see fit see dictatorial power is being handed
[09:14.880 --> 09:19.800]  to the government by the government illegally this is the essence of
[09:19.800 --> 09:28.240]  tyranny the essence of the seizure of power this is a bona fide tyranny
[09:28.240 --> 09:34.680]  bona fide authoritarian system and I saw all these republicans getting up
[09:34.680 --> 09:39.520]  there righteously saying this is tyranny this is the end of freedom this is
[09:39.520 --> 09:45.160]  the greatest power grab ever this is treason this is an overthrow of our
[09:45.160 --> 09:50.840]  country of our republic limbaugh saying it they're all saying it they're
[09:50.840 --> 09:57.280]  telling the truth but hey guys hey girls you were for the Patriot Act clearly
[09:57.280 --> 10:00.880]  written for the American people has nothing to do with foreign cave dwellers
[10:00.880 --> 10:07.040]  in Central Asia you were all for illegal wars not declared by Congress wars of
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.160]  aggression lies about WMDs now confirmed to be premeditated lies not
[10:12.160 --> 10:16.800]  mistakes you're all for having the military run warrantless checkpoints in
[10:16.800 --> 10:21.480]  the nation you're all for North com spying on the American people without
[10:21.480 --> 10:26.720]  warrants and secret arrest and torture you're all for shutting down websites
[10:26.720 --> 10:33.320]  you don't agree with see this is how tyranny works it's always sold against
[10:33.320 --> 10:40.480]  some unpopular minority in the case of Nazi Germany Jews communists and others
[10:40.480 --> 10:47.800]  but it's always designed for the mass because you are the people the system
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.720]  wants to rob and once they start violating the Bill of Rights and
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.560]  Constitution there is a race to the bottom and now the bottom has fallen
[10:58.560 --> 11:05.800]  out there's nothing holding us up anymore and the system wants to fully
[11:05.800 --> 11:12.200]  bankrupt the country and the states so they can bring in a new order a new bank
[11:12.200 --> 11:18.840]  of the world a new constitution a open world government billed and sold as the
[11:18.840 --> 11:24.040]  savior to the world economic crises all these decades they denied they were
[11:24.040 --> 11:28.800]  forming quietly a shadow world government now it's coming out of the
[11:28.800 --> 11:35.200]  shadows because they think they've got us right where they want us now
[11:35.200 --> 11:38.080]  throughout the next few hours I'm going to walk through all the different
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.160]  facets of this I tried to get to it all yesterday and we covered quite a bit but
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.240]  I want to really go deeper today but also want to open the phones up but
[11:46.240 --> 11:50.840]  specifically on tyranny in this country and the government health care plan and
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.400]  what you're going to do to stop it now there isn't going to be a silver bullet
[11:56.400 --> 12:00.680]  to this but the number one thing is getting informed getting active getting
[12:00.680 --> 12:06.560]  on your feet getting aggressive and staying angry and never stopping and
[12:06.560 --> 12:10.720]  realizing that many hands make light work this is going to be a process the
[12:10.720 --> 12:15.120]  globalists have come to power through an incremental process we are going to take
[12:15.120 --> 12:22.400]  our society back through an incremental process through the long view of history
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.520]  we're having a lot of victories against them they can't get the Senate to pass
[12:26.520 --> 12:31.240]  their global carbon tax takeover so they're illegally going to implement it
[12:31.240 --> 12:36.720]  through the EPA but the lawsuits are being filed by the states and by private
[12:36.720 --> 12:39.760]  interest but more importantly the states are lining up to say they're going to
[12:39.760 --> 12:43.760]  pass laws that nullify it and that they just won't follow it within their
[12:43.760 --> 12:48.320]  borders on the second amendment on the land grabs on the carbon taxes on every
[12:48.320 --> 12:53.360]  front they tried to get their Copenhagen treaty through to set up the banking
[12:53.360 --> 12:57.880]  world dictatorship that failed so now they're just having the central bankers
[12:57.880 --> 13:03.040]  of the G 20 set it up by fiat we have to challenge that criminality see now
[13:03.040 --> 13:08.000]  it's about open tyranny they try to pass this stuff they they try to get it
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.640]  through and sell the public but when they can't they go ahead and try to implement
[13:13.640 --> 13:17.360]  it regardless but then it's that much more obvious what we're dealing with but
[13:17.360 --> 13:23.120]  they have gotten this bill through it will go to the president this week he
[13:23.120 --> 13:30.680]  will sign it and they got it by very thin margin what four votes and it will
[13:30.680 --> 13:35.480]  be political suicide for the Democratic Party but they're bought and paid for
[13:35.480 --> 13:41.320]  that was their job to collectivize this country for the banks the bigger problem
[13:41.320 --> 13:45.760]  is the Republicans will be swept to power in November in the house in the
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.960]  next election they should it'll take two elections to get control of the Senate
[13:49.960 --> 13:54.800]  and in two and a half three years a look for a Republican president to be
[13:54.800 --> 14:00.320]  elected unless Obama's controllers stage some false flag terror attacks and look
[14:00.320 --> 14:05.520]  for the Republicans to not fully repeal this legislation if I had this
[14:05.520 --> 14:15.320]  simplify this issue it's about a long hard war and it's about identifying
[14:15.320 --> 14:20.920]  incumbents as the enemy and cutting government and cutting taxes to cut off
[14:20.920 --> 14:28.800]  the blood supply to this tumor and if I had to simplify the legislation itself
[14:28.800 --> 14:34.280]  I analyze the first four versions of the bills we had a lot of experts on to go
[14:34.280 --> 14:42.000]  over it with a nonpartisan true analysis and Saturday morning and then
[14:42.000 --> 14:52.720]  again last night I did a lot of keyword searches in the 2700 page bill and all it
[14:52.720 --> 14:57.120]  does is let the federal government take control of health care and then turn the
[14:57.120 --> 15:01.920]  IRS loose the biggest expansion of IRS power in its history the private
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.880]  collection agency for the private Federal Reserve and it really doesn't
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.040]  even give people free health care those that are supposedly getting the free
[15:11.040 --> 15:15.280]  health care won't be able to get jobs in the debt economy so they'll be forced
[15:15.280 --> 15:22.960]  to get it it doesn't even do that until 2018 it does extend some Medicare and
[15:22.960 --> 15:29.560]  Medicaid payments to a larger group of people and that's supposedly raised off
[15:29.560 --> 15:34.000]  of people making a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year or combined
[15:34.000 --> 15:44.200]  incomes of 250 thousand but what it does is cut Medicare and Medicaid cut the
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.640]  amount of money that can be spent on it and it begins the long process of the
[15:48.640 --> 15:56.760]  government telling doctors via federal government controlled computer systems
[15:56.760 --> 16:01.840]  what treatments they can give people and that's under the term comparative
[16:01.840 --> 16:06.600]  medicine and laid out by the original author of the bill three years ago Tom
[16:06.600 --> 16:12.640]  Dashel in his book but first before I go to your calls I wanted to get into this
[16:12.640 --> 16:16.320]  issue because I had a caller on the Sunday show and it was near the end of
[16:16.320 --> 16:23.120]  a lot of time to elaborate and he said Alex now now explain this to me how are
[16:23.120 --> 16:29.280]  the insurance companies for this well to be clear the big insurance companies
[16:29.280 --> 16:35.360]  that are subsidiaries of the private central banks who get all this government
[16:35.360 --> 16:41.320]  debt they are for it because this will cause a vertical integration through
[16:41.320 --> 16:44.760]  government monopoly over health care there are some smaller groups of
[16:44.760 --> 16:50.880]  insurance companies and others who did lobby against it and I don't have it
[16:50.880 --> 16:53.800]  in front of me anymore I do have some articles I dug out this morning but I
[16:53.800 --> 16:58.480]  remember I was a few months ago in an airport in Los Angeles and bought a
[16:58.480 --> 17:01.240]  Wall Street Journal and I read that article several times on air where it
[17:01.240 --> 17:09.320]  had quotes by the head lobbyist who was the head of the political pack for the
[17:09.320 --> 17:17.240]  health insurance industry saying look we wrote this bill and we like this
[17:17.240 --> 17:24.880]  bill but if you put a public option in here we are going to put our support
[17:24.880 --> 17:28.360]  against it and so that's why you don't have a true public option in this
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.960]  legislation all either thing you're getting a free ride a free lunch you're
[17:32.960 --> 17:39.880]  gonna get your salaries cut if this ever even gets implemented it's so
[17:39.880 --> 17:45.680]  unconstitutional so illegal and so they're on record at press conferences
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.400]  admitting all of this and so all it is is a new tax by stealth and a government
[17:50.400 --> 17:55.200]  power grab as Biden the vice president said last Friday we will quote the
[17:55.200 --> 17:59.200]  Democrats will quote the government will quote own and run health care as a
[17:59.200 --> 18:05.200]  political power brokers that they can dole out to people and selectively
[18:05.200 --> 18:17.880]  enforce but here's CNBC today March 22 2010 health care stocks to outperform and
[18:17.880 --> 18:22.000]  it goes on to say insurance company stocks pharma stocks and health care
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.320]  management company stocks should perform better in the next few months at first
[18:28.320 --> 18:32.520]  they're gonna be down a little bit and and that was what was predicted last
[18:32.520 --> 18:36.960]  week as people sort out the bill but now they're already going up many of them
[18:36.960 --> 18:39.640]  this afternoon and they predict in the next few months that you'll see a big
[18:39.640 --> 18:44.560]  increase in the stock values that's why Warren Buffett who's a big insurance
[18:44.560 --> 18:49.960]  company owner he owns a lot of steak and large predominantly health insurance
[18:49.960 --> 18:54.160]  companies that's why he was for this because this forces depending on how you
[18:54.160 --> 19:02.000]  look at the numbers 30 to 40 million people to buy insurance because if you
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.680]  are self-employed say upper blue collar lower middle class and say you're 35
[19:07.680 --> 19:13.000]  years old and maybe you got insurance for your kids but not for yourself you're
[19:13.000 --> 19:18.160]  going to be forced you and your wife to go out and get this and so that's a lot
[19:18.160 --> 19:20.600]  of money going to be going to the insurance company so there's no doubt
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.440]  they wrote the bill they control the bill but that's a CNBC health care stocks
[19:25.440 --> 19:32.160]  to outperform cheat US health care stocks should perform well in the next few
[19:32.160 --> 19:35.960]  months now that legislative uncertainty about reform in the sector has been

[24:38.280 --> 24:42.400]  panels it has the government deciding what test and what surgery you can have
[24:42.400 --> 24:46.840]  the grandfather of all of this Tom Dashell wrote a book we read his quotes
[24:46.840 --> 24:52.520]  out of Bloomberg yesterday where he said the old have a duty to die just like in
[24:52.520 --> 24:59.160]  Europe and they decide what health care you can get and they're taking over
[24:59.160 --> 25:05.880]  health care and the IRS is to be their enforcer but continuing here's business
[25:05.880 --> 25:13.560]  week today health care overhaul adds millions of US customers that's right
[25:13.560 --> 25:18.280]  immediately it makes self-employed people go out and buy insurance that'll be
[25:18.280 --> 25:22.680]  phased in very very quickly and there's all these new taxes on small
[25:22.680 --> 25:30.000]  employers and on corporations and all these fines and fees if you don't get
[25:30.000 --> 25:37.600]  insurance nothing but a big tax drug makers and health insurers will gain
[25:37.600 --> 25:43.480]  millions of customers under legislation overhauling the US medical system the
[25:43.480 --> 25:47.920]  industry also will pay new fees of the government and face stricter rules that
[25:47.920 --> 25:55.240]  may narrow profit margins and fuel mergers see the big boys wrote this and
[25:55.240 --> 25:59.560]  this will give you less choice did they let you go across state lines to get
[25:59.560 --> 26:05.040]  insurance no did they talk about kicking the 30 million illegal aliens
[26:05.040 --> 26:12.320]  bankrupting the system off no are they covered in the bill yes the bill the
[26:12.320 --> 26:21.800]  House passed 220 211 vote yesterday so I guess it passed by nine votes excuse me
[26:21.800 --> 26:25.560]  expands coverage of 32 million uninsured Americans according to
[26:25.560 --> 26:30.520]  congressional number crunchers that means more sales for Pfizer Inc the
[26:30.520 --> 26:34.480]  world's largest drug maker United Health Group Inc the largest health insurer
[26:34.480 --> 26:40.160]  and a cluster of other companies led by a Mara Group Corp that specializes in
[26:40.160 --> 26:49.120]  managing services through Medicaid a program that will grow in the remake so
[26:49.120 --> 26:56.400]  see they cut the quality of Medicare and Medicaid and more of the profits will
[26:56.400 --> 27:01.840]  go to the mega corporations the top four or five on the top and you'll get less
[27:01.840 --> 27:05.760]  choice and then you'll get cruddy health care and the government will take a big
[27:05.760 --> 27:13.320]  cut of it as tax money to be given as interest on the debt remember what
[27:13.320 --> 27:19.680]  Kucinich said three months ago this is out of MSNBC health reform legislation
[27:19.680 --> 27:24.880]  is a bailout for insurance companies well it's not even a bailout it's a
[27:24.880 --> 27:31.840]  robbery the house most unabashed progressive condemned Democratic leadership
[27:31.840 --> 27:34.880]  for removing his amendments that would allow state to create their own single
[27:34.880 --> 27:39.440]  payer systems then he called the entire legislative package a bailout for
[27:39.440 --> 27:43.720]  insurance companies oh yeah I mean if you're gonna have real socialism it's a
[27:43.720 --> 27:49.200]  lot cheaper and it's constitutional to have the states say we're gonna tax you
[27:49.200 --> 27:54.000]  and give poor people health care but no no no no no no no the big insurance
[27:54.000 --> 28:01.200]  companies and banks and big pharma wrote this and there's one consortium
[28:01.200 --> 28:07.160]  company we just mentioned that runs it all and of course Warren Buffett's
[28:07.160 --> 28:12.360]  heavily invested in that and he helped get Obama in to power it's all about
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.960]  monopolies that's where the real power is created and maintained and expanded
[28:16.960 --> 28:21.880]  remember what John D Rockefeller the first said competition is a sin he said
[28:21.880 --> 28:27.520]  it over and over again it was a mantra he wrote news articles editorials saying
[28:27.520 --> 28:33.240]  competition is a sin and health care costs are gonna go up and up and up and
[28:33.240 --> 28:41.120]  the quality is gonna go down down down all run by a mera group corp in that
[28:41.120 --> 28:46.320]  nice itself a subsidiary of the private shareholders of the Federal Reserve
[28:46.320 --> 28:51.400]  here's the Washington Post back in December three months ago health care
[28:51.400 --> 28:59.240]  bill wouldn't bring real reform Howard Dean or C flip-flop quickly we'll talk
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.440]  about solutions to fight this and how to resist these people after we take some
[29:03.440 --> 29:06.640]  calls and I'm gonna just go through a laundry list of issues and points I
[29:06.640 --> 29:11.360]  want to make about this after we hear some of your points and coming up this
[29:11.360 --> 29:17.960]  is Bloomberg today Obama pays more than Buffett as US risk triple a rating
[29:17.960 --> 29:21.920]  talks about how Warren Buffett's company gets a better rating than the US
[29:21.920 --> 29:26.960]  government and how treasuries they're having trouble selling treasuries now
[29:26.960 --> 29:32.040]  this is happening worldwide as they get ready for a global devaluation first
[29:32.040 --> 29:36.520]  they had to seize control of health care another way to empower the banks and
[29:36.520 --> 29:42.840]  prop up their derivatives tsunami the government running health care the I
[29:42.840 --> 29:51.280]  lrs garnishing your wages does that sound like the American way no we're on

[33:19.960 --> 33:27.960]  answer is no can you go home and tell your senior citizens that these cuts in
[33:27.960 --> 33:33.160]  Medicare will not limit their access to doctors or further weaken the program
[33:33.160 --> 33:41.160]  instead of strengthening it no you cannot can you go home and tell your
[33:41.160 --> 33:46.480]  constituents with confidence that this bill respects the sanctity of all human
[33:46.480 --> 33:51.360]  life and then it won't allow for taxpayer funding of abortions for the
[33:51.360 --> 34:01.080]  first time in 30 years no you cannot and look at how this bill was written can
[34:01.080 --> 34:08.080]  you say it was done openly with transparency and accountability without
[34:08.080 --> 34:18.400]  back room deals and struck behind closed doors hidden from the people have you
[34:18.400 --> 34:24.040]  read the bill have you read the reconciliation bill have you read the
[34:24.040 --> 34:43.400]  manager's amendment order mr. Speaker both sides would do well to remember the
[34:43.400 --> 34:54.400]  dignity of the house mr. Speaker in a few minutes we'll cast some of the most
[34:54.400 --> 35:00.600]  consequential votes that any of us will ever cast in this chamber the decision
[35:00.600 --> 35:05.840]  we make will affect every man woman and child in this nation for generations to
[35:05.840 --> 35:12.000]  come if we're going to vote to defy the will of the American people then we
[35:12.000 --> 35:37.480]  have to have the courage to stand before them and announce our votes one at a time
[35:37.480 --> 35:44.200]  I sent a letter to the speaker this week asking that the call of the role be
[35:44.200 --> 35:50.480]  ordered for this vote and Madam Speaker I ask you will you in the interest of
[35:50.480 --> 36:07.440]  this institution grant my request will you mr. Speaker grant my request
[36:07.440 --> 36:18.160]  that we have a call of the role mr. Speaker rhetorical question will you
[36:18.160 --> 36:26.160]  grant my request that we have a call of the role under clause 2a of rule 20 a
[36:26.160 --> 36:31.480]  record vote is conducted by electronic device unless the speaker directs
[36:31.480 --> 36:39.280]  otherwise and you mr. Speaker will you grant that request that's Republican
[36:39.280 --> 36:45.640]  leader John Bonner in the House of Representatives and they did not allow a
[36:45.640 --> 36:52.200]  vote with yeas or nays because they're a bunch of cowards and they know that
[36:52.200 --> 36:57.680]  every poll out there shows more than 70% of the American people against the
[36:57.680 --> 37:03.440]  government running health care sure some polls show more than 50% that want to
[37:03.440 --> 37:08.760]  give poor people some health care you know this is a big hearted country a lot
[37:08.760 --> 37:13.200]  of stupid people that think there can be free lunches and then our society won't
[37:13.200 --> 37:19.160]  collapse and it won't breed dependency but the vast majority of Americans know
[37:19.160 --> 37:24.920]  the government will not deliver that all they ever do is break every promise
[37:24.920 --> 37:29.800]  they've made they've stolen the Social Security money they've stolen the
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.560]  Medicare and Medicaid money and now they're jacking up all these stealth
[37:33.560 --> 37:38.640]  taxes that many of which go to the federal government but a lot of it goes
[37:38.640 --> 37:45.480]  directly to the top insurance companies and that's why they wrote this bill so
[37:45.480 --> 37:49.960]  to all of you socialists out there that believe in this imaginary pot of gold
[37:49.960 --> 37:55.160]  with leprechauns at the end of it that serve out free lunches you need to know
[37:55.160 --> 38:00.600]  you're going to get lower standards of care and let me tell you something nobody
[38:00.600 --> 38:03.920]  goes without care in this country the illegal aliens already know that we've
[38:03.920 --> 38:09.200]  had Ron Paul on a medical doctor to talk about it my dad's a physician and the
[38:09.200 --> 38:13.160]  illegal aliens know they show up at the hospital they get whatever they need they
[38:13.160 --> 38:17.360]  have babies here it's all paid for citizens are told and taught they don't
[38:17.360 --> 38:25.720]  get health care taken care of Rob Jacobson was real sick and needed to have
[38:25.720 --> 38:29.160]  a surgery and they were telling him he didn't get to have it and I went and
[38:29.160 --> 38:33.640]  showed him the rules and he went and got a $40,000 surgery in hospitals stay all
[38:33.640 --> 38:38.880]  paid for and it was done through the charity department because under the old
[38:38.880 --> 38:45.040]  rules and old laws one-third of a physician's work is to be done for free
[38:45.040 --> 38:51.480]  that was taught in the colleges until just a decade ago you are supposed to
[38:51.480 --> 38:57.880]  render free or discounted care we had the best health care system in the world
[38:57.880 --> 39:02.120]  and the least expensive until government in the last 35 years got involved and
[39:02.120 --> 39:08.560]  the more tax money it got pumped in to the big giant oligopolies the big health
[39:08.560 --> 39:12.760]  cartels who are incredibly corrupt the more money got pumped into them the more
[39:12.760 --> 39:17.400]  the prices went up that's just one reason 30 million illegal aliens and the
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.240]  rest of it adds to it all right I said I'd go to your calls there's just so
[39:22.240 --> 39:28.360]  many facets I want to go over another issue because I know the Constitution
[39:28.360 --> 39:33.600]  but now they're admitting it all over the news that that is the case an
[39:33.600 --> 39:38.800]  executive order does not trump a congressional law and so Obama has said
[39:38.800 --> 39:44.320]  he'll sign an executive order restricting taxpayer money going to
[39:44.320 --> 39:49.320]  abortions but as Ron Paul pointed out on Fox News last night that this has
[39:49.320 --> 39:52.200]  already been going on you've already been funding abortions with with with
[39:52.200 --> 39:57.080]  Medicare and Medicaid and all these different systems you've already been
[39:57.080 --> 40:00.080]  paying for it the federal government comes into hospitals with money it's
[40:00.080 --> 40:05.080]  given to them and they simply shuffle the funds around they'll take the money
[40:05.080 --> 40:11.240]  and and use it on one area of care and then use the money from that old area
[40:11.240 --> 40:16.800]  and move its money over into abortion may even have a term for it but
[40:16.800 --> 40:23.640]  regardless an executive order does not trump congressional law now usually
[40:23.640 --> 40:29.400]  Congress doesn't challenge the president or past presidents when they use
[40:29.400 --> 40:38.360]  executive orders to bypass law just like they can't pass the greenhouse gas
[40:38.360 --> 40:44.120]  tax takeover 2,000 plus page bill home inspections if you don't make the
[40:44.120 --> 40:49.280]  changes in your house under federal zoning in a one week your home can be
[40:49.280 --> 40:55.160]  taken and forefooted without a judge a jury control of people's land taxes on
[40:55.160 --> 41:01.000]  flatulence of cows and pigs grabbing huge areas of property Australia is
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.120]  already doing it taxes on all industry all oil all power all energy 2.6
[41:07.120 --> 41:12.160]  billion tax in three years in Austin within three years of it 2.6 billion
[41:12.160 --> 41:18.640]  I'm just using the town where I live as a microcosm example you notice though
[41:18.640 --> 41:24.040]  Congress isn't saying to Obama okay we can't pass the greenhouse gas tax bill
[41:24.040 --> 41:33.280]  but you go ahead and implement it through the EPA and other federal agencies
[41:33.280 --> 41:40.920]  and they're doing it so it's the same thing but in reverse yeah Obama may
[41:40.920 --> 41:44.560]  sign the executive order and when we see it I'll guarantee it's gonna have holes
[41:44.560 --> 41:53.200]  in it you can fly 747 through holes as wide as the Grand Canyon and then the
[41:53.200 --> 41:58.000]  bill is what is going to be acted on and you're going to pay for abortions they
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.880]  had polls in Austin were over 80% of Austinites and Travis County again
[42:02.880 --> 42:06.720]  were just where I live only County in Texas that uses taxpayer money for
[42:06.720 --> 42:10.040]  abortions tens of millions of dollars a year to Planned Parenthood and others
[42:10.040 --> 42:14.440]  didn't matter if the commissioner's court was packed out didn't matter if the
[42:14.440 --> 42:18.560]  vast majority of people in the town where I live were against it they still do
[42:18.560 --> 42:22.960]  it they just do what they want because this is a lawless group of criminals and
[42:22.960 --> 42:26.320]  the way they passed the bill was illegal the way they gave special favors was
[42:26.320 --> 42:29.920]  illegal the way they wouldn't let the public see it until the day of the vote
[42:29.920 --> 42:34.720]  or the day before the vote was illegal and if they're gonna do something
[42:34.720 --> 42:40.200]  unconstitutional illegal why not just have the deeming well they said Sunday
[42:40.200 --> 42:45.080]  they weren't gonna do that because that was so outrageously criminal oh we're
[42:45.080 --> 42:52.240]  not even gonna have a vote period we'll just say it's long the speaker Pelosi
[42:52.240 --> 43:00.760]  deems she's got the votes oh okay nobody has to be on record so this could be
[43:00.760 --> 43:04.320]  used against the enemy if you stay angry if you stay focused if you stay
[43:04.320 --> 43:08.640]  involved if you start working now against it but I've heard the Democrats
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.320]  bragging they say oh don't worry this isn't gonna politically hurt us because
[43:13.320 --> 43:18.160]  this doesn't kick in for a few years well the taxes kick in immediately but they
[43:18.160 --> 43:22.680]  think that their constituents are gonna like some of the little freebies they
[43:22.680 --> 43:27.640]  get they'll wonder why they can't find a job this economy already has 22%
[43:27.640 --> 43:35.080]  unemployment this will easily push up to 25 or higher but still they think that
[43:35.080 --> 43:38.440]  you're not gonna notice the implementation of this or the IRS grabbing
[43:38.440 --> 43:42.280]  your refund or garnishing your wages they think they can depoliticize it it
[43:42.280 --> 43:45.880]  will just fade into the background and be something that's unpopular that just
[43:45.880 --> 43:52.960]  continues on forever like abortion 64 to 67% the polls we've seen are against
[43:52.960 --> 44:00.720]  abortion still continues you've got over 90% 91% in Gallup poll against the
[44:00.720 --> 44:04.520]  open borders and all the freebies and the anchor babies for the illegals
[44:04.520 --> 44:12.720]  continues you got 60 plus percent of Americans wanting us out of Iraq it
[44:12.720 --> 44:21.240]  continues you had 99% and then that's conservative 2,000 calls to every one
[44:21.240 --> 44:25.920]  call for the banker bailout people knew that was a fraud they knew it wasn't to
[44:25.920 --> 44:29.400]  get their mortgages unfroze they weren't stupid people finally figured out the
[44:29.400 --> 44:35.200]  government's a pack of criminal liars they still rammed it through so they
[44:35.200 --> 44:39.560]  don't care if 70 plus percent of Americans in the average focus group or
[44:39.560 --> 44:44.240]  poll are against this they don't care this is a group of lawless criminals and
[44:44.240 --> 44:47.560]  so what of these house members that voted for this get kicked out this year
[44:47.560 --> 44:52.800]  or two years after that the next congressional election they don't care
[44:52.800 --> 44:55.880]  because they're all gonna get revolving door jobs and their wives and
[44:55.880 --> 44:58.600]  husbands are gonna get revolving door jobs and their kids are gonna get
[44:58.600 --> 45:04.200]  revolving door jobs in the big health care industry companies and banks that
[45:04.200 --> 45:08.320]  made the payoffs they're all gonna get half million dollar quarter million
[45:08.320 --> 45:13.280]  dollar jobs out of this me right here in Austin where I live the former mayors
[45:13.280 --> 45:17.880]  and city council people that stole tens of thousands of acres in the late 90s
[45:17.880 --> 45:23.400]  under SOS they now literally own private banks and companies that build and own
[45:23.400 --> 45:28.560]  the housing areas the luxury million dollar and up homes that were built all
[45:28.560 --> 45:32.440]  over the Texas Hill Country with the land they stole this is pure mafia ladies
[45:32.440 --> 45:38.200]  and gentlemen they don't care they're seizing over a trillion dollars this is
[45:38.200 --> 45:42.600]  this is actually small monetarily compared to the banker bailout heist of
[45:42.600 --> 45:47.160]  28 trillion that's gonna hit you with dollar devaluation alright I'm gonna
[45:47.160 --> 45:51.080]  shut up go to your calls now until the bottom of the next hour then I've got
[45:51.080 --> 45:54.760]  more audio clips of Pelosi saying this is a declaration of independence life
[45:54.760 --> 45:59.560]  liberty pursuit of happiness you deserve this I mean these are the shackles and
[45:59.560 --> 46:03.600]  may they sit lightly upon you those out there that like this forget that you're
[46:03.600 --> 46:11.600]  our brethren but the truth is most people didn't buy this and so the tyranny
[46:11.600 --> 46:16.120]  the corruption is coming out in the open and that's a good thing if we can stay
[46:16.120 --> 46:21.120]  angry stay focused have the states challenge it but not just with lawsuits
[46:21.120 --> 46:26.240]  with laws saying in our state this is null and void the federal government of
[46:26.240 --> 46:33.000]  the commerce clause has no authority to be doing what they're doing and the fact
[46:33.000 --> 46:37.400]  that this thing is selectively enforced makes it even more outrageous and more
[46:37.400 --> 46:42.440]  discriminatory okay okay let's go to your calls I've got a lot to get to though
[46:42.440 --> 46:47.560]  folks Steve in Michigan you're on the air go ahead hi Alex can you explain to me
[46:47.560 --> 46:50.880]  some things about this healthcare bill can you explain to me how it's gonna
[46:50.880 --> 46:59.800]  affect small business owners and labor unions well here's the problem I'm gonna
[46:59.800 --> 47:05.160]  be honest with you I have probably spent more time than most talk show host well
[47:05.160 --> 47:09.840]  there's no doubt of that and most members of Congress trying to read the last
[47:09.840 --> 47:16.040]  five bills I have not read this 2700 page bill I did keyword searches in the
[47:16.040 --> 47:21.600]  last few days on it and I've read the breakdown and analysis of it and on its
[47:21.600 --> 47:28.520]  face it is a 2.5 to 5% tax on all businesses and then a tax on all
[47:28.520 --> 47:32.600]  workers you're going to pay for the so-called free healthcare it will also
[47:32.600 --> 47:37.080]  then cause a lot of businesses to not expand because the liability of hiring
[47:37.080 --> 47:43.360]  more employees it will hurt the economy mean look at how the greenhouse gas
[47:43.360 --> 47:46.480]  taxes right when our economy is imploding they come in and want to
[47:46.480 --> 47:53.200]  slap a 50% tax on all coal plants that supply 51% of our power everything is
[47:53.200 --> 47:56.960]  about shutting the economy down bankrupting you driving you into
[47:56.960 --> 48:00.280]  welfare driving you into the control of the banks so the government has a
[48:00.280 --> 48:04.480]  bigger and bigger dependent class of not just government workers but people on
[48:04.480 --> 48:09.720]  the dole who can then be used as a political weapon to further rob the
[48:09.720 --> 48:14.440]  elite classes political enemies the middle class it's pressure from above
[48:14.440 --> 48:18.680]  and below and over the next decade as they fully destroy the middle class they
[48:18.680 --> 48:23.440]  will then cut all benefits to the poor just like Nigeria or Argentina or
[48:23.440 --> 48:26.720]  countless other countries that have gone through this IMF World Bank shock
[48:26.720 --> 48:32.160]  therapy system I mean this is a tried and true system of economic financial
[48:32.160 --> 48:46.360]  conquest a single payer means the government just writes you a check and
[48:46.360 --> 48:49.920]  you don't have to go deal with an insurance company but the Republicans
[48:49.920 --> 48:53.920]  tried to say that there was a public option and a single payer in this and
[48:53.920 --> 48:58.080]  there really isn't it's even worse than that if we're gonna have socialism you're
[48:58.080 --> 49:02.960]  gonna take my money then there should be absolutely no bureaucracy and the
[49:02.960 --> 49:06.640]  person you know should just be given the health care but no that's not gonna
[49:06.640 --> 49:13.320]  happen what it does is it gives money to insurance companies to give a lower
[49:13.320 --> 49:18.360]  standard of care Steve I appreciate your call let me explain to you this way my
[49:18.360 --> 49:23.360]  dad's a dentist and oral surgeon and he's done over the years consulting for
[49:23.360 --> 49:30.080]  big dental chains and he's tried to explain to dental chains that it works
[49:30.080 --> 49:36.040]  the first few years but after that it destroys the dentist there and the level
[49:36.040 --> 49:41.200]  of care what they'll do and this is just one part of it's called capitation an
[49:41.200 --> 49:46.760]  insurance company or an HMO will come in to a hospital or a clinic or a chain of
[49:46.760 --> 49:50.760]  dental offices whatever the medical care is and they'll say we'll give your
[49:50.760 --> 49:56.080]  chain of say 300 dental offices or 300 emergency clinics these are just
[49:56.080 --> 50:02.320]  hypotheticals these are boil downs we'll give you 30 million dollars and on a
[50:02.320 --> 50:09.840]  two-year contract to accept all of these cards but you've got to do it for this
[50:09.840 --> 50:14.240]  incredibly low amount and many times it won't even cover say in the case of
[50:14.240 --> 50:20.240]  dental offices the cost of the labs that have to make the dentures or the and so
[50:20.240 --> 50:27.560]  that quality goes down and the dentist are literally making 20 30 bucks an hour
[50:30.640 --> 50:36.040]  so I mean there it is and so you get lower standard of care people don't
[50:36.040 --> 50:39.000]  want to become nurses they don't want to come doctors they don't want to become
[50:39.000 --> 50:48.800]  nurses they want to become dentist and so what you get is something like Cuba or
[50:48.800 --> 50:52.520]  England where there's big giant lines to get health care it happens everywhere
[50:52.520 --> 50:58.840]  that's why Canadians and Cubans and Brits and Germans come here for health

[52:19.800 --> 52:25.280]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[52:25.280 --> 52:29.160]  pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation

[52:38.680 --> 52:42.360]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who to make the checkout to
[52:42.360 --> 52:47.440]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[54:19.960 --> 54:26.000]  robbery I for years I've been talking about how different Mexican gangs and
[54:26.000 --> 54:29.480]  Latin American gangs just don't care they're killing cops all over the US
[54:29.480 --> 54:33.560]  when they do kill them it's kept real quiet though because they only want to
[54:33.560 --> 54:37.920]  demonize patriots and conservatives and libertarians and gun owners with cops
[54:37.920 --> 54:41.800]  and the ADL and Southern Primary Law Center have them all shaking in fear of
[54:41.800 --> 54:48.000]  anybody with an American flag or NRA sticker on their car literally but I
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.040]  want to get into the Vagos Motorcycle Club pumping gas into the LAPD police
[54:52.040 --> 54:57.680]  department try to blow it up booby trap guns narrowly killing cops killing
[54:57.680 --> 55:03.240]  police and it's just my it's just a minor footnote and I want to dovetail that
[55:03.240 --> 55:06.680]  with how our country is going to collapse just like Mexico because we have a
[55:06.680 --> 55:11.320]  criminal government and once your government goes bad the criminals at all
[55:11.320 --> 55:15.360]  levels just become completely lawless let's talk to Ralph in Wisconsin Ralph
[55:15.360 --> 55:22.120]  you're on the air thanks for taking my call on yesterday's show you had mentioned
[55:22.120 --> 55:26.640]  that you know a typical business owner will compensate for the cost of
[55:26.640 --> 55:31.520]  health care by lowering wages for existing employees and you know possibly
[55:31.520 --> 55:36.200]  letting some employees go my question is do you think it's possible that they
[55:36.200 --> 55:40.480]  would also raise the prices of their products and services you know which in
[55:40.480 --> 55:47.680]  turn would cause the congressional accounting office and other organizations
[55:47.680 --> 55:52.360]  that break this down the general accounting office as well have said
[55:52.360 --> 55:57.600]  there's no doubt that this is going to cost the economy 500 plus billion
[55:57.600 --> 56:02.200]  dollars over the next five years it's gonna cost a lot more than that I mean
[56:02.200 --> 56:06.560]  they told you it was a 787 million dollar bailout now it's 28 trillion
[56:06.560 --> 56:11.160]  according to Bloomberg and that number is almost three months old so absolutely
[56:11.160 --> 56:14.840]  but that's what again what does Bloomberg report today as well as
[56:14.840 --> 56:21.440]  business week the big insurance companies the top four wrote this and they
[56:21.440 --> 56:26.720]  stand to become incredibly powerful so this is an organized consolidation with
[56:26.720 --> 56:32.560]  whole new levels of red tape written by them this is designed to shut down
[56:32.560 --> 56:37.080]  industry I mean this is the post-industrial world what is the UN said
[56:37.080 --> 56:40.480]  what have the fake environmentalists said this is what they want they want to
[56:40.480 --> 56:52.120]  run your life these are control freaks okay we'll take the LA Times last week
[56:52.120 --> 57:00.040]  28% increase in the first year of the mayor's new greenhouse gas taxes 28%
[57:00.040 --> 57:09.520]  cost in gas and electricity first year and again of all of this is designed to
[57:09.520 --> 57:15.520]  rip you off but what this is is taxes to private interest see that's the new
[57:15.520 --> 57:24.240]  frontier is taxes to insurance companies taxes to power companies it's just it's
[57:24.240 --> 57:31.720]  blasphemous I agree I was so upset when it passed last night well Ralph that's
[57:31.720 --> 57:35.400]  the good news people are really angry they see this for what it is it shows us
[57:35.400 --> 57:39.800]  the government is lawless so the wake-up call is here and the government's not
[57:39.800 --> 57:44.080]  gonna stop now they've already gone for broke so gert yourselves for political
[57:44.080 --> 57:49.200]  battle Frank and Louisiana you're on the air I'm gonna be with you Alex I
[57:49.200 --> 57:54.040]  thought you gave a great presentation of what it's really all about you see the
[57:54.040 --> 57:57.360]  former government government we're under is a putocracy we've lost the
[57:57.360 --> 58:02.760]  Republic and this medical plantation has been planned for a long time just like
[58:02.760 --> 58:08.000]  the drug infested and crime-ridden welfare plantation what they're trying
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.760]  to do is they're setting up a massive bureaucracy the bureaucracy that
[58:12.760 --> 58:17.320]  they're gonna set up is that if you think you can go to your doctor your
[58:17.320 --> 58:21.640]  dentist and just get the regular health care that you're used to that you've
[58:21.640 --> 58:26.200]  actually paid for that everything is gonna be guideline and it's gonna be
[58:26.200 --> 58:30.640]  limited care I fear that it's gonna be right there no it it says limited care
[58:30.640 --> 58:32.840]  in there to stay there I want to come back to you because you're hitting the
[58:32.840 --> 58:37.760]  nail directly on the head you're a hundred and ten percent right we'll be
[58:37.760 --> 58:53.200]  right back stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite
[58:53.200 --> 58:56.760]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[58:56.760 --> 59:00.440]  Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become
[59:00.440 --> 59:04.240]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds and all perform even gold and
[59:04.240 --> 59:08.080]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[59:08.080 --> 59:11.680]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[59:11.680 --> 59:17.120]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[59:17.120 --> 59:21.200]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part
[59:21.200 --> 59:25.200]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get
[59:25.200 --> 59:29.280]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at
[59:29.280 --> 59:34.440]  survivalseedbank.com that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at
[59:34.440 --> 59:45.200]  877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid
[59:45.200 --> 59:51.480]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[59:51.480 --> 01:00:00.520]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:12.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:31.400]  Alex Jones this is a corporate robbery the insurance companies the top insurance
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:36.000]  companies wrote this legislation to force 30 plus million Americans to buy
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.880]  their overpriced crud then the government comes in with government power and
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:47.360]  lowers the standard of care we're gonna break all that down coming up today but
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:54.160]  you've got the 16,500 to 20,000 to begin with IRS agents with new total power to
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:00.600]  grab your refunds bank accounts whatever they want and the IRS can now
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:06.640]  share your medical records and your tax data the IRS is now your doctor they've
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.920]  been good faithful servants and just like in Europe where they give you
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:17.560]  Prozac for a brain tumor just go away and die and you're gonna see it all
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.880]  manifest I mean remember the case for killing granny the cover of Newsweek
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.560]  how great it is to get rid of old people and then meanwhile they deny oh we
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:30.760]  don't want to ration care see once they get you collectivized then they can
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.680]  play the dumb down mass off against anybody that's got two pennies rub
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.200]  together and say yeah you're drinking beer you're eating steak or you're eating
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.240]  ice cream you're unhealthy well we've got a tax salt and fat we've got to now be
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.880]  the nanny state and run your life this is the global plantation this is the
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.880]  welfare plantation and Frank and Louisiana he laid it out Frank go ahead
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:57.440]  and finish up yeah Alex they you see the the left in this country which has
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.000]  been a useful tool for the for the bankers because they've always pushed the
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.240]  marks the Marxists in national they paid for it 1917 because that's what they
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.640]  want for people not for themselves and what's happening here is they're not
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.480]  telling they tell you this a figure they throw out of 30 million people going to
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.760]  be done in who are uninsured are going to be insured look that figure was bogus
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.960]  they don't tell you about the 270 80 million million people that they had
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.840]  planned to put under this plantation system which they set up about 80 or
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:35.400]  90 years ago well that's right Hillary what 17 years ago tried to force every
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.880]  American to be on a government health care plan so that failed so now they've
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:45.040]  done it by stealth that's a very good point well you see and the key to me
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.200]  that when I was listening to this stuff was when they said that the IRS is
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:54.960]  going to be the the copo that's going to do this stuff well if you've read if
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:58.320]  anybody knows anything about the whole system we know that the federal reserve
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.160]  banks are private Lewis versus United States tells us that but if you look
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:09.600]  IRS is not even an agency of the United States as the term agency is defined
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.280]  crisis corporation versus brown and the diversified metal product now it's a
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.040]  closet governmental organization it's an NGO of the private banking cartel the
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.760]  global government is private banks and they're now openly announcing a global
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.400]  government oven for and by the banks the banks of sees the nations now a global
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.320]  constitution where the banks sign a global government agreement with each
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:38.400]  other you're under a little plutocracy the stocks the stock is owned by the
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:43.040]  banks on everything just about the Rockefellers the Rothschilds they own
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.720]  this stuff literally and like you said you pointed out well you got to separate
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.840]  the big transnational corporations from the small guys as a difference between
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.400]  the two if people think that they're going to get something for nothing I got
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.840]  news for you the insurance companies will give you some extra but they're
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.560]  going to charge you for it they don't do nothing for free so a big class of
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:10.400]  American people are going to pay more money in taxes I mean more money in
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.960]  taxes and for their insurance that's set you know so some will receive a little
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:21.440]  something in the plantation mentality people will say oh this is good but for
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:26.080]  the rest of us you know we're going to just keep being drained and drained and
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:30.040]  drained which is all part of the plan and it's going to be hard and it's going
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:34.680]  to be hard to repeal this you got to have 60% of the House vote for it and
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:39.320]  the Republicans they always complain about the Democrats when they pass this
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.280]  stuff but they're going to love controlling it when they get into power
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.960]  we've got to have a complete shift in this nation and remove this criminal
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.480]  banking cartel or it's only going to get worse great points Frank D. John

[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:35.320]  attempts to implement the Copenhagen Treaty by stealth and this big University
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:43.440]  research project in Canada that found that on average environmentalists that
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.880]  were interviewed in a double-blind study are six times more likely to steal and
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:55.600]  to lie well of course their parasite control freaks that doesn't mean if you
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.360]  want to drink clean water or don't want to over fish the ocean or don't want
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:06.480]  genetically engineer food on your table as a real common sense environmentalist

[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.480]  now but then at the bottom of the next hour I'm gonna go through a point by
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.680]  point on this and just blitz through all the information and all different
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:58.480]  angles and facets but of all the important points about the bill specifically
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.120]  it does not give anyone free health care
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:09.400]  anyone new free health care if you're on welfare you get horrible government
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:14.720]  health care the CPS hunts your children you know takes the poor people's
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:22.400]  children at birth puts people on drugs gives them horrible care but this
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.120]  doesn't give people free health care it's a bunch of taxes for the government
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:33.800]  and tens of millions of people that are forced to go buy insurance from a ever
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:39.040]  consolidating pool of big-moneyed interest that financed this and that's
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:47.000]  in business week today the hundreds of billions of dollars a year that the top
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.520]  four to five there's four insurance companies and then one overall
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:57.720]  management consortium so five total and it reports the incredible profits
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:01.840]  they're set to make and how they're going to consolidate the market but look
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.720]  at the genius of it posing as so-called communist and socialist and liberals
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:13.320]  they had MSNBC and CNN beat the drum that insurance companies are against this
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:19.800]  insurance companies are against this and so the average person out there who
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:25.160]  buys into the collectivist model it's actually not the working poor and blue
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.360]  collar folks they're a lot smarter than your college educated control freak
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:35.360]  but you've got the welfare plantation slaves black white it doesn't matter
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.000]  you've got the illegal alien contingent that just know it's a free ride because
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.960]  they're here to drive down wages so they've got to be given a supplement to
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:56.360]  be here they have no idea the larger plan and if you go back to 1993-94 with
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:02.600]  Hillary care it said every American is given a national ID card and every
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:06.080]  American will have to go through the government to get their approved
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:12.020]  insurance or to have the government provides you insurance or care single
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:20.280]  paired public option and you were gonna have that national ID card well now
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.520]  you've already got one you know Clinton couldn't get it in 94 so a few months
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.880]  after it failed he signed the executive order that we cover in my film America
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:34.640]  destroyed by design where he said all the states that they want their highway
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.280]  funds they take the state's money send back about 33% on average with strings
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:44.200]  attached the feds say bush signed an executive order four years ago saying if
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.360]  you want any highway funds you've got a handover so many thousand miles of roads
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:55.680]  per state to private toll road companies to put toll roads on it see this is all
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.080]  about private interest they go in they give the politicians money the
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.000]  politicians say okay have the infrastructure but you got to hire all
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.240]  my buddies and my cronies on top of it this is just piracy this is grand
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:14.080]  larceny and so Bush did that the Republicans went along with that you
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.600]  think they're really gonna repeal this no they may make a few changes they'll
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:28.680]  probably cut the little bit of care you get that's why Howard Dean had said three
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:32.640]  months ago this is a Republican bill and it really is what you'd expect from the
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:39.080]  Republicans it's a big ripoff just like Bush and the banks a year and a half
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.480]  ago right before he left office but it's all continued by Obama it makes no
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.480]  difference we have to have a complete wake up to the system and that's why
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.200]  Politico reports Dick Cheney's writing letters they're raising money all the big
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:55.680]  neocon groups are going after Rand Paul in Kentucky he's beating in all the
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.000]  polls by upwards of 10 points the Democrat who's got all the big funding
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:12.520]  and the Republican he's probably going to end up being the Republican the new
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:18.000]  Republican senator from Kentucky see it isn't just the Kennedy seat being lost
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.600]  to Brown in Massachusetts it didn't just Deborah Medina get 19 points out of
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.000]  nowhere in Texas this is happening everywhere people are starting to get it
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.600]  so this could blow up in the system's face they're losing more battles now
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.920]  than they're winning that's why they're so desperate to get full control of your
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:41.600]  life now and so they wanted a national ID card they couldn't get it so instead
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.360]  they did it through the driver's license and they said in the executive order
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:48.840]  they haven't implemented all of it but they have implemented the real ID part
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:53.240]  where it's federally standardized with a face scan photo thumbprint all integrated
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.120]  into a federal system took him a few years to get it done but by 2004 it was
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.680]  in place they announced it to the slaves a few years later and said we better
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:09.680]  have a congressional law on this they put it in then they try to pass the law
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:17.040]  and what did that executive order do it created a ID number and it says in the
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.320]  bill they can take urine and blood to get a driver's license now you hear about
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.280]  cops everywhere at checkpoints taking blood without warrants under federal
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.600]  grants they're just training you that cops take your blood that's what they do
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:35.880]  and they put you in naked body scanners that's what they do this is the public's
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:46.600]  complete and total journey into bondage into slavery but think of the genius of
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:55.960]  the big insurance companies the top four with this other data company a mera
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:01.480]  group core that's the banking monopoly that runs it and interfaces with
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:11.080]  Medicare and Medicaid think about it they tell everybody well they never had to
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:17.280]  say it the news would lie and say they weren't against it because they would
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.640]  have never gotten away with this if they said oh by the way you're going to
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.760]  become physical slaves to the insurance companies the IRS is going to grab your
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.640]  refund your bank account or garnish your wages to make you if you're privately
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.200]  employed let's say you mow lawns for a living and they've got provisions for
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.920]  money laundering in there if you're getting paid cash in mowing yards you
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.800]  want to just live out in your little house you got 10 acres out in the
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.440]  country you drive into town to mow yards I know a lot of people do that live
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.480]  pretty good have a little bass boat you know you're not rich but the wife and
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.720]  kids are doing well they're certainly not hungry you're happy that's over
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.320]  remember last year million dollar fine for garage sales that aren't federally
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.120]  approved associated press this isn't a game folks this is about hunting you
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:07.600]  down running your life you're going to buy the health care and you're going to
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:13.520]  have IRS agents come to your house do you understand you're going to be under
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.160]  the government's control you're going to work for them now you're going to take
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.920]  your money and you're going to put it into an insurance company who then gets
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:27.720]  to lower the quality and so if you missed it here it is simply they couldn't
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:32.760]  get the national ID card through with Hillary care so they did it through the
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.640]  driver's license and now they're coming back with your tax ID number through the
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:44.280]  IRS and your social security number and now you've got your plantation ID
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:54.360]  number running your health care oh my gosh it's just the magnitude all right
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:18:00.160]  who's up next here John D in Minnesota thanks for holding her on the ear hi
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:08.760]  Alex um the bill was 3500 where can I HR 3590 actually is what it was where can
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.480]  I go to see that because I can't pull it up through a Google search no you go to
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:20.680]  thomas.loc.gov thomas.loc.gov Library of Congress and you I mean just just put
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:27.360]  into search engine the final text of the past health care bill or the text of the
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:33.440]  of the house health care bill and we can do it right now I read 4872 and that was
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:39.680]  bad enough I wanted to see 3590 because when I was watching that c-span debate
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.760]  last night that's where this thing originated from so I wanted to see it
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:50.600]  and read it see if what I was thinking was correct that it is bad
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:56.560]  let's be clear I mean I mean the Democrats I drove out to Fredericksburg
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:01.200]  out in the country this weekend with my family so driving out there I listened
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:05.600]  to XM driving back I listened to XM and I listened to all the Democrats on CNN
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.120]  CNBC Fox they admitted well of course the IRS is going to be collecting it
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.640]  they're good at that and well of course you're gonna have your wages taken well
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:20.480]  of course I mean it none of this is debatable this is all admitted okay so
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:26.640]  that the website was Thomas loc.gov yes and you put the bill number in there
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.480]  it'll give it to you okay also one other question does it not say in the
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:37.120]  Constitution that only Congress has the authority to declare to declare war on
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.280]  somebody I thought I'd seen that exactly but but so-called conservatives that
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.600]  means warmonger said in Korea and Vietnam we don't need any stinking
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.840]  declaration of war that was just as treasonous as a healthcare bill and so
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.440]  again the government has been breaking every cannon of our free society

[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.840]  world's been down this path with the banks Europe's been down this path this
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:37.960]  is designed to bankrupt us Don and Ohio you're on the air yeah Alex I'd like to
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:42.520]  read a letter from yesterday's Cleveland plane dealer in response to
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:47.840]  congressman's casinic's switch to a yes vote on the health care plan sure okay
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.800]  it says Dennis Kasinich as a longtime resident of the 10th congressional
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.360]  district I am disgusted that you have chosen to vote for the health care bill
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:02.680]  and I will for the first time in my long life work diligently to vote you out in
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:08.800]  November you swore an oath to uphold the Constitution but you have chosen to put
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:15.560]  equality before liberty my family left a communist country specifically in search
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:21.520]  of freedom escaping a government promising equality Democrats after many
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.480]  years of Republican excess have awakened the sleeping giant that is America
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:34.360]  understand it for for those of us who value liberty above all else equality
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:40.240]  means nothing to one who is not free remember what Thomas Jefferson said
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:45.280]  when the people fear their government there is tyranny when the government
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:50.960]  fears the people there is liberty our eyes are wide open now and we're paying
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:58.400]  close attention and if we stay awake and get active you don't have to save the
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:02.640]  world by yourselves folks just do little things and wake others up and get their
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:08.320]  eyes wide open instead of wide shut as they've been we can turn this around and
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.760]  what's so bad about casinic is he came out and analyze the bill as a ripoff for
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.520]  the top insurance companies and banks so did Dean I mean it's bad enough to say
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.840]  we're gonna tax middle-class people and give it to poor people but that's not
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:28.560]  even what this does it's a complete ripoff and everybody's gonna experience it
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:37.960]  now absolutely could I read three more lines from the end of another letter go
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:44.040]  ahead it says how fitting it is for the mayor who bankrupted Cleveland to become
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:49.280]  the congressman who helped to bankrupt the country I tell you people in the
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.960]  Cleveland area really know what's going on now I hear you Don I appreciate your
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:59.000]  call you know I keep going back to Austin where I live it is now per capita
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.880]  the richest city in the United States not Manhattan not San Francisco a lot of
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:11.880]  the rich people from those cities and all the crime have moved here many of the
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:18.000]  shopping centers and places I drive by are half empty the joblessness is
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.280]  exploding the government's raising all these taxes I've got articles here today
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.120]  where they're telling police everywhere to increase the fines and fees and all
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:30.440]  the it's just more and more taxes less and less benefit they only give you
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:36.960]  benefits and a great society to get you domesticated you know how our
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.920]  ancestors thousands of years ago domesticated cows they were just wild
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:48.120]  buffalo running around in Europe it's the same species there's different
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:54.840]  varieties oxen it's what they called buffalo in Europe look very similar to
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:00.640]  American buffalo well how you domesticate them is you start putting out a
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.800]  grain that they like in a little fenced in area but with an opening and the
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:13.120]  cows start coming in the wild bovine and after a few months they start expecting
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:20.400]  the food and then you start closing the gate and then you cut out their offspring
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:27.800]  when they have babies you raise them in a new pen you feed them you raise them and
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.600]  now they're domesticated and that's what government is that's what government
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.880]  schools are it's taking your children raising them in the government pens I
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.320]  mean how did how did our ancestors thousands of years ago
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:41.880]  domesticate pigs they were wild boars running around same way how we
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.560]  domesticate horses same way how we domesticate donkeys same way how we
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:54.800]  domesticate chickens same geese same turkeys same dogs first animal humans
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.720]  domesticated tens of thousands of years ago you start giving them little
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:07.800]  table scraps from the campfire from the camp or even better you kill the mommy
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:14.160]  and daddy and you take the puppies that's how they did it and what did the
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.360]  communists do what did the Nazis do they took over people's kids it's very very
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:22.840]  simple ladies and gentlemen this is not rocket science that's what's so horrible
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:28.640]  about it we know what collectivism is we know it's tyranny we know it America was
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:33.760]  truly free market wasn't perfect but four percent of the population had half
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:38.120]  the world's wealth over 90% of the patents we were the best when we had
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:42.720]  some monica of freedom you take freedom you become a cesspit like Mexico or

[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:20.120]  missus you we took a little they weren't getting any free healthcare then you
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:27.440]  imagine they told people in the 1800s or even the 1900s the government's gonna
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:34.680]  give you something for free they laugh they'd say are you kidding boy trying to
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:38.360]  rip me off you think I'm stupid
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:44.160]  on the drum the steps so high and they made the bugles ring we stood beside our
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:48.560]  cotton veils didn't say a thing fired our guns and the British kept becoming
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:53.080]  there wasn't as many as there was a while ago that's all we've got to do is
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:59.280]  keep firing our guns in the info war standing tall and strong tell the truth
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:03.680]  oh he creased it we could take them by surprise if we didn't fire muskies till
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.760]  we looked them in the eye we held our part till we see their faces well then
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:12.640]  we opened up the squirrel guns and really gave them well let's go to George in
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:20.120]  Connecticut thanks for holding George hey Alex welcome I think welcome I I was
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:23.480]  thinking these guys are so devious maybe we got to be a little devious to maybe
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:28.360]  on the state level why can't we get our state legislatures they don't want to
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.880]  do this stuff put a couple of poison pills in this thing so they can't can't
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.840]  implement it in our states for example force them to have the public options
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:41.040]  that insurance companies don't want this so they mean this is one way to get the
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.080]  more worked up great job actually actually actually rob one group to actually
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.400]  give it to another group that in the bankers and it'll never happen that you
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.360]  knew exactly where I was going you'll read my mind exactly and also do that
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.880]  force them to take the money and put it has to be taken from the state and
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:01.960]  directly to the state's coffer so they can't get it directly and that way the
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:07.280]  feds that way the feds won't get 70% of the money exactly you've been reading
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:12.800]  my mind Alex well no that's common sense I mean that's common sense but you know
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:16.760]  they've specifically written the bill where it's look where it's hard for
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.720]  that to happen we just need the states to not just sue as 38 Attorney Generals
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:23.960]  are stating this is completely unconstitutional the federal government
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.800]  has no business not just taking your money and and and giving it to offshore
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:32.800]  banks but giving it to insurance companies and then taking control of
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.680]  health care I mean the government is saying they're going to decide what
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:40.400]  type of health care you can get and so what this does is this is going to raise
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:45.760]  everybody's insurance that doesn't have pre-existing conditions so that people
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:49.600]  with pre-existing can get it now I've read the actual section of the bill it
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:53.000]  doesn't even guarantee someone with a pre-existing will get it it's just
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.720]  saying you'll get like a little you know government health care funding that
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:03.800]  gives you some cruddy care Alex I have an idea for a t-shirt as well maybe you
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:09.680]  know IRS on the chest of Uncle Sam and a black ops thing holding granny and
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:14.440]  shaking up the last pennies and then on the bottom it has dashals expression
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:19.960]  now you're now you should be ready to die or you have the right to die if they
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:23.880]  rip you off absolutely I appreciate your call it's a great t-shirt I did
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:34.120]  George make one just to be clear about this they are implementing it slowly so
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.920]  that people don't get too upset again it's domestication it's done
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:42.680]  incrementally but the country is so bankrupt already I agree with Ron Paul
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:47.080]  he was being questioned on Fox News last night and they said well do you see
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:51.040]  this ever being repealed and he said well I see it being repealed by the
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:57.600]  country going bankrupt but that's the problem the banks don't care they
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:02.800]  believe Northcom and the police state they've set up is going to be able to
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.760]  maintain control of the government throughout this process and they don't
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:13.000]  care if things get messy five years ago we reported that the CIA was launching a
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.400]  drug war in Mexico against scores of cartels that were not part of the CIA
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:22.680]  money laundering operation in the $500 billion a year industry here in the US
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:29.400]  alone and that you would see all hell break loose in Mexico and we had former
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:35.760]  DEA agents on we had sheriff's on we had scholars professors who's written books
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:44.200]  about Mexico on all predicting it this is a war they don't care of Mexico
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:48.080]  completely collapses as long as the big banks get all the drug money it's the
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:51.360]  Mexican government teamed up with our government doing this well how do you in
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:56.720]  the whole thing you you decriminalize the drugs and then there's not a
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:01.240]  monopoly over it the price drops it isn't cool to use it anymore low level
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:05.240]  drug dealers aren't driving brand new Corvettes and Escalade's they're not
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:11.880]  cool anymore just like in prohibition you in prohibition the mafia loses its
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.160]  business you have 10 years of alcohol prohibition the mafia more than
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:22.440]  tripled in size and it corrupted our police so that I mean the government
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:26.200]  doesn't care of it wrecks Mexico in the Southwest in fact it's out in my car
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.040]  remind me to get it before we go live on TV I want to show people the headline
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.480]  on the cover of the San Antonio Express News Sunday morning I bought the Sunday
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:40.880]  paper I'm going for memory but the headlines South Texas towns and cities
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.960]  collapsing how many years have I been telling you that the media wouldn't
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:52.420]  cover it it's collapsing they are killing cops every day I see articles in
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:57.920]  Texas New Mexico Arizona Nevada California where the Mexican cartels and
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.360]  drug dealers and motorcycle gangs are killing people they don't care they're
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.480]  completely lawless see you've got a domesticated American people that roll
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.720]  over to tyranny and so the police and government squeezes pushes around dress
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:15.000]  up in their black uniforms radius abuses because we're easy targets the cops are
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.640]  scared to death of the Mexican mafia they're scared to death of the Russian
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:31.200]  mafia who are overtly out killing cops but then citizens say oh we just want
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.160]  to arm ourselves as militias the government's gotten too big to protect
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:39.240]  ourselves and oh Homeland Security and North com and the ADL so then probably
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.400]  Law Center run around screaming in fear because you have a criminal class with
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:48.520]  all these thousands of different criminal groups who all at the highest
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:56.040]  levels work together Terry in Ohio you're on the air yeah I like I work for
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:04.120]  for two insurance companies here in Ohio and I know from what I was told
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:09.800]  going through training and everything like that that they informed us of the
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:16.440]  banks that they own and the insurance companies even their spokesman even
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:22.960]  stated that the insurance companies will never go under because if insurance
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:29.200]  companies go under under this nation the United States and other countries will
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.600]  also go under because it's the insurance companies who have the money and it's the
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:40.480]  people who give the insurance the money through insurance policies annuities
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:45.560]  and now they're going to make you buy something from them they are the
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:49.760]  governments but to say that insurance companies own banks that was the
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:55.440]  insurance company spokesman basically creating the inverse it's not even that
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:02.280]  banks own insurance companies the top four it's that they are banks it's just
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:08.240]  a subsidiary of the private banking system this working for the insurance
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:15.280]  company when people will lapse their policies like they can't pay on them and
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:19.600]  that and such as that they can't make their premiums when the insurance
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:25.320]  companies have lapses in policies which here just a few years back they had a
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:33.160]  very big major class action suits filed filed against many of your bigger ones
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:38.360]  because of these universal policies that they sold people that they had them
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:43.200]  turn in their whole life policies and buy these universal policies that had
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:48.680]  variable interest rates and things on them and people lost their entire life
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:54.120]  insurance policies that they had and they were paid up policies but the people
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:59.240]  still come out on the on the bad end of things for plain simple reason they
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:03.520]  didn't realize what they were doing they were being talked into something that
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:10.080]  wasn't true they were lied to well these are to say I lost my job at one of
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:12.600]  those insurance companies I mean they're probably gonna say well he's
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:18.000]  disgruntled well I'm not disgruntled because I quit because I chose not to
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.560]  do something dishonest and I was told to tell the 21 agents under me because I
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:32.040]  was a manager that they will do exchange these policies for people so that we can
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:38.240]  you know take a paid-up policy and make them buy another policy at a variable
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:43.280]  rate that they would do that or they would lose their jobs and I said no I'm
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:49.240]  not doing it and and I left the company well I went to another insurance
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:53.760]  company because I had an insurance license and it and it's the same thing
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:59.080]  there they own loan companies they they have loan companies they have banks they
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:03.800]  have all the money and even them when I went through their training because they
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:07.920]  will want to have you go through to teach what they want you to teach or to
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:12.520]  say to people one of the things that they even pointed out is insurance
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:17.160]  companies will never go down because they are the ones that control the money
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:22.360]  and control the government absolutely I appreciate your call the insurance
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:27.240]  companies are a arm of the big central banks I don't mean your corner insurance
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:33.080]  company you know the big mega insurance corporations they're an arm of the big
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.880]  banks to take control of your life and now oh you must buy car insurance oh now
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:43.880]  you must buy health insurance next you must buy fire insurance and then when
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:50.840]  people can't pay you then go basically on to the government dole and then
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:55.600]  taxpayers pay to get you all of that insurance and it's less and less tax
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:59.560]  payers more and more people on the dole but the big insurance companies and
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:06.080]  banks don't care because they're taking control of society in the process but
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:14.000]  think of the genius of this it's come out in the news they've admitted that in
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.920]  the last decade they would order the people that were out there selling
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:24.080]  mortgages to lie to folks and to get them to sign on to mortgages that they
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:29.960]  knew they couldn't pay because the banks didn't care they were literally just
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:37.160]  loaning fiat money that they produced out of nothing and I'm gonna cover this
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:41.080]  more in the next hour I've mentioned it a few times but I want to spend more time
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:49.640]  on it failed banks may get pension fund backing as FDIC seeks cash this is in
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:52.640]  Bloomberg and in business week both because business week something by
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:57.080]  Bloomberg now and it says that the government is going to the bigger
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:02.720]  pension fund owners and to the government state county city and federal
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.960]  that administer these and because they're political creatures that take
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:13.160]  political orders they are telling them invest in derivatives and invest in
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:20.960]  failing banks to prop it up and the government has said when we go fully
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:27.440]  bankrupt they're gonna take your private pension and they're going to tax it and
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:31.120]  then give you part of it back and by the time they're done you'll get none of it
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:38.000]  I mean it's just it's unbelievable it's it's it's it's unspeakable if this is
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.440]  happening Mike in Texas you're on the air hey what's going on guys first time

[01:53:55.160 --> 01:54:06.320]  understand the system call 800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237 folks I've been on
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:11.360]  the air almost 15 years I remember reading the Department of Labor the
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:16.160]  Department of Commerce the Agriculture Department talking about how they're
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:19.400]  gonna tax everything you eat everything you do they're gonna track you with a
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:26.640]  national ID card that you've got a swipe that then has a graduated sales tax you
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:29.880]  in the name of poor people not having to pay sales tax we have to track
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:36.600]  everybody's purchases and who they are they're gonna tax salt prison time if
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:44.840]  you don't make changes to your house they order this is serfdom and we don't
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:48.920]  make this stuff up I mean when I read an executive order by Clinton to take
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:54.200]  blood to get a driver's license and when I read the federal documents 14 years
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.920]  ago about how they take babies blood at birth and I showed the documents on air
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:01.360]  people thought I was making it up they wouldn't even go look it up I'm not
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:06.200]  making any of this stuff up you know how frustrating this is that bonafide
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:12.360]  hardcore great a tyranny oppression authoritarian garbage scientifically
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:18.280]  being foisted on us it's disgusting Aaron Chris Annie Brian Steve I'm going to
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:22.600]  hear in a moment I've done an hour and 55 minutes and I haven't even plugged yet

[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:26.360]  call Aaron in Nevada thanks for holding yes thank you very much Alex all right
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:33.680]  and I've woken up I'm on 20 cups of coffee basically what I want to do is a
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:39.000]  march on the White House a march on Washington you have the platform you
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.920]  have the audience to coalesce that kind of people movement I think we got to
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:50.920]  have after the wake-up we got to have action and if the Mexicans the illegal
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:58.720]  alien Mexicans can march on our capital so can we well I want to be clear I want
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:02.080]  to be clear and I'm not pooping what you're saying but they were over the
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:09.040]  park police said a million two hundred thousand tea partiers so a few thousand
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:12.040]  illegals March they want some free health care they're about the only grip
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:15.280]  that actually gets something free but that's only because it's to destroy the
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:19.560]  wages and turn us into a third-world nation and to allow the US to be a
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:25.080]  steam valve so Mexico doesn't completely get overthrown so the bankers are doing
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:29.320]  them a favor that way for the elite in Mexico because they were forced to stay
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:32.720]  down there they would have taken their country back a long time ago but I think
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:36.120]  marches you know to the capital into the White House are important but those are
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:41.200]  happening every day sir the media just ignores it so what we do is we build the
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:46.400]  alternative media and we take back our states look the states are where the
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.600]  fight is at we have the 9th and 10th amendment the states need to be
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:54.240]  pressured and they're ready to do it to not just sue over this health care bill
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:00.080]  or over the greenhouse gas tax bill which is now happening what we need to
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:06.120]  have them do is pass laws saying we're not gonna follow this so that's what I
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:11.120]  think the number one solution is what do you say to that I say there is no time
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:15.920]  for that and in order to be taken seriously because you represent like the
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:21.160]  truth movement and the other stuff that is the key partiers are not really you
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:27.360]  know representing I'm talking about your cadre of people that are about this
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:32.400]  marching I think it's good to include that with the DVDs with the waking up
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:36.280]  yeah a lot of it said listen I got a jump I got a jump here and we'll come back
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:41.880]  take more calls it's just they're right back

[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:12.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:20.280]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:28.640]  Alex Jones we need to march on the state houses we need to be in the state
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:33.200]  houses corridors in the capitals we need to be running for political office to
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.880]  take our states back and nullify the federal government that's been seized
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:42.280]  by offshore criminals that is the biggest solution and we need to person to
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:47.040]  person educate people and take our cities and counties back that is the
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:52.360]  big solution and yes support candidates that are truly constitutionalist at the
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:57.960]  federal level I'm all for marches ladies and gentlemen but say when I do coast to
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:02.680]  coast a.m. for an hour I reach probably three million people I reach two million
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:08.280]  people a day on this radio show the power of what I do media wise is all the
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:12.680]  25 films the thousands of radio shows the tens of thousands of interviews I've
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:19.080]  done in the last 15 years but when I do just one thing or one event we don't
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:24.760]  have that much power the power is in my overall body of work and in the people
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:29.240]  we've woken up in my response to Aaron saying I need to organize a march on
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:34.600]  Washington let's talk to Chris in Washington you're on the air yeah this
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.880]  is a great segue into your what you're saying about needing to get to the state
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:41.720]  government I'll show you what you're what we're doing in Washington and Idaho
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:45.080]  because there's this thing called a ballot initiative where you can bypass the
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:49.080]  state legislatures and the governor and have something directly submitted to the
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:54.600]  people for them to go I was getting ready to say no naked body scanners in
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:58.960]  their state I mean this is happening you've got to go to your states and say
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:04.440]  no in-state tuition for illegal aliens we actually have ballot initiatives in
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:09.240]  Idaho right now circulating that would not go to a bill which basically red
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:13.440]  butchers believe sign last night it's neutered it bases oh AG please petition
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:17.280]  the feds and sue them so this doesn't go into effect no what we've got is a bill
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.400]  we need 60,000 signatures being sub circulate right now with it authorized
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:25.440]  the state to arrest federal officials attempting to enforce Obamacare mandates
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:29.760]  in the state of Idaho and we have the same bill and that's how it always worked
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.960]  I mean the I mean the FBI had a few crimes they could investigate it was very
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:37.680]  controversial and they even created them back in the 20s and 30s and they would
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:42.280]  have to come hat in hand now they're involved in everything including some
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:47.240]  idiot 16-year-old saying black people must leave Walmart and they're having
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:50.840]  press conferences and the feds all rubbing their hands together to sound
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:54.840]  like they're trying to stop racism when all it's about is federalizing local
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:59.960]  police we have got to kick the feds out of our states that's what the founding
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:05.880]  father said is our main course of redress I agree with you and all it takes
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:09.400]  is you use the power of the internet with the initiatives we've got a fight
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:12.960]  for example I don't know if I don't know initiative.com and it's freedom
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:16.160]  initiatives.com people can go there if they're in Idaho and they just stop stop
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.200]  for a minute because you're number one you're over driving your phone it's
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:22.080]  distorting so not hearing all of what you say and you and you were punching
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:29.560]  buttons give us the website slowly Idaho initiatives.com Idaho hold on a minute
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:33.840]  you just did it again oh sorry my voice is too loud no no no you just you're
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:39.160]  hitting buttons every time you you give the website give it one more time Idaho
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:46.320]  initiatives.com threes the charm and a freedom initiatives.com for
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:50.720]  Washington and if people just print these out give them to their associates
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:53.880]  and whatever and we can get we've got a series of initiatives here that are all
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:58.760]  about taking and other states can take the your initiatives or write their own
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:01.560]  initiatives and people say well what's the power in that I appreciate your
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:05.320]  call great call Chris that's taking action that's the kind of call I like
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:09.560]  we're gonna talk about solutions coming up later in the hour but I'm gonna break
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:17.440]  down the entire legislation here but I had the idea eight years ago to have
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:20.120]  cities and counties and states say we're gonna follow the Bill writes a
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:25.240]  constitution we're not gonna follow the Patriot Act 800 plus cities and towns
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:29.720]  passed it and that's in a strong message but you need to get the states to pass
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:37.240]  it and absolutely that is a power-packed call from Chris that is
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:43.840]  important and it's a lot of work and you won't succeed every time but when you
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:53.360]  first don't succeed try try again because we know sitting here sucking our
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:58.440]  thumb isn't gonna save us but when we know when we take action we kick New
[02:04:58.440 --> 02:05:03.800]  World Order butt hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are

[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:26.000]  simulcasting and living video color in this multicast at prisonplanet.tv now
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:30.800]  I originally set James Dillingpole up for the show one in Telegraph writer best
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:36.160]  selling author to talk about a Canadian study that came out that shows how many
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:42.480]  more times likely environmentalist are to be dishonest to rob the steel and how
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:47.440]  they hate their fellow man now anyone who's had their SUVs tires slashed here
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:52.480]  in Austin or had their car dealership burned down in Denver or had their home
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:56.360]  burned down in Los Angeles knows how vicious these people are they're a
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:02.280]  gang of thugs who use the moral excuse of hating their fellow man as an excuse
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:06.440]  to be collectivist and it doesn't matter if it's the head of climatology at
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:10.520]  NASA saying we want to destroy the industrialized world people live too
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:14.240]  well in the West there's too many people in the third world their greenhouse
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:18.280]  gas taxes will conservatively kill a billion additional people in the first
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:22.360]  10 years of implementation that is very conservative numbers from Lord Monkton
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:28.800]  who scientifically broken it down this is the facts that we're talking about and
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:32.160]  this integrates into health care but first we're going to talk to him about
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:36.280]  health care because he's also written about the nightmares of government run
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:39.280]  health care in England now listen I don't need to talk to mr. Dillingpole to
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:44.200]  know this I've got Paul Watson Steve Watson that work for us at info wars
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:48.760]  dot com prison planet dot com one lives in London one in Sheffield they've you
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:52.720]  know got insurance and it's a nightmare everybody has to wait everybody gets
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:57.400]  treated like trash but I've seen Tony Blair three or four years ago before he
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:01.320]  left office in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's questions on
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:06.320]  c-span and they were standing up giving cases of one woman waiting 18 months for
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:12.440]  a brain tumor they reported that it was over 90% operable means they could take
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:16.920]  it out and save her 90% of the time she would have a hundred percent recovery but
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:21.040]  if you wait more than six months almost a hundred percent chance she died and she
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:26.280]  did die and Blair said yes that's too bad we're working on that he didn't even
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:31.400]  deny it why are Canadians coming here why are British coming here why are
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:36.040]  people from socialist nations coming here because free market gave us the best
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:40.560]  health care in the world government involvement in the last 35 years is what
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:44.240]  screwed up our health care so we're going to get James Dilling polls take on
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:48.680]  that his websites James Dilling poll dot com he's also a best-selling author
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:53.520]  will tell you all about that before he leaves us or the best-selling book on
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:57.880]  Obama and certainly turned out to be very very accurate it was released right
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:02.160]  as Obama got into office last year but this isn't just James Dilling poll
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:07.800]  saying this this is the national post of Canada here's the London Guardian
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:14.280]  giving a document cam shot how going green may make you mean ethical consumers
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:19.200]  less likely to be kind and more likely to steal many times more likely and then
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:26.000]  the BBC even said oh the greenies are criminals Dilling poll had a tongue and
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:31.840]  cheek article but very serious in the body greens sacrifice babies to Satan
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:35.560]  sell grandmothers into slavery except well remember what happened out in
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:40.560]  Latin America last month you had a wife and husband kill themselves and then
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:46.360]  try to kill the baby because they were worried about global warming in fact
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:50.880]  here's a story out of the telegraph Liar's cheats thieves the terrible truth
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:56.240]  about the mean greens here's another one our green consumers more unethical
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:02.440]  look these people you go to a grocery store the paper bags bust on you I've
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:07.000]  read the statistics that they actually create more acid more pulp more energy
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.480]  used not that that matters that's industry it's renewable the plastic is
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:16.840]  actually better but they don't care they will get in your face about it these
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:21.280]  people want your house they want your car and if you go to zoker park there's
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:25.640]  glass everywhere in Austin just everywhere all over the ground anyone that
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:30.560]  parks in SUV it happened to us gets it keyed if you're lucky normally windows
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:37.240]  locked out tires slashed hey listen I got three children I got my wife when my
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:42.400]  parents went someplace with us a few weeks ago all of us all seven of us
[02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:47.240]  could ride in the car but these little control freaks want to run our lives now
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:51.320]  I'm ranting I apologize the deling pole we're gonna get into this coming up but
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:55.520]  first I wanted to get into government-run health care and what it's really
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:00.920]  like from airstrip one in this 1984 system mr. deling pole good to have you
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:04.760]  with us thank you for having me back Alex yes they want to tell you about the
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:10.000]  about the British National Health Service experience well it seems to me
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.160]  that there are two ways of allocating scarce resources you know to do with
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:20.160]  health and one way is to do it through the market to you know if you pay then
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:24.920]  you will get service the other way which is what we've got here in Britain is a
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:31.040]  form of state rationing now maybe this way of allocating health care was
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:36.240]  appropriate immediately after the Second World War but somehow I feel that the
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:39.680]  world has moved beyond the Second World War mentality where you're kind of
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:44.840]  grateful for what you get and you know you're happy to queue up for for your
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:51.200]  for your rubbish service the fact is that Britain has the lowest council
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:57.040]  account for survival rate in the G8 that is in itself is a pretty grim
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.760]  indictment of our system we also have I don't whether whether you you follow
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:07.640]  this in America we had the scandal of Stafford Hospital the hospital where as
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:15.120]  many as 1,200 patients may have died because of government targets oh I saw
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:18.760]  I saw an article last week where the guy just showed up over three days and died
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:24.400]  on a gurney yeah this sort of thing happens at this particular hospital
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:30.720]  patients were being left unwashed up to a month they were abandoned in their
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:35.080]  soiled bloodstained sheets the nurses weren't doing anything about it they
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:39.280]  weren't giving them water they weren't you know the patients were crying out in
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:42.960]  pain now I'm not saying that this is necessarily the common experience you
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:46.520]  know that everyone suffers every time they go into a national health service
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:51.080]  hospital sometimes you do get good treatment and you know when you do I
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:58.600]  mean I burned my hand once and after my after my three hours in a waiting room
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:04.200]  that made the Star Wars cantina scene look like Baywatch eventually I got my
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:08.680]  I got my treatment but you do have to you do have to wait a very long time and
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:13.240]  often the service you get is rather grudging because you know you are
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:18.160]  treated as a supplicant not as a paying customer you are treated more or less
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:22.120]  like you don't really deserve to be there and that's what Tom Dashel three
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:25.480]  years ago said in his book we've been reading the quotes where we need to be
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:30.560]  like Europe where old people know they have a duty to die yeah the grass is
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:36.960]  always greener isn't it I mean I you know I do I do worry for America because
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:41.600]  I think okay so you've you've now adopted this new Obamacare system it's
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:47.440]  gonna cost you a an awful lot of money and be the moment you give big
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:53.640]  government a say in allocating health health care big government also feels
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:58.840]  it suddenly has the right to tell you how you should live your life how much
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:03.800]  you drink how fatty your food is where they're already they're already saying
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:09.840]  thousand dollar fines in jail time for salting your food in New York State and
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:14.960]  I see I'm pushing similar things now in England absolutely absolutely we know
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:19.600]  we have this traffic light system now on our food and supermarkets whereby you
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:24.760]  know red means means that dangerous you know and the means treat with caution
[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:29.560]  and and green means go it's safe and low in cholesterol and stuff you know they're
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:34.200]  setting the precedent to literally run your life and tax certain foods more I
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:36.840]  mean they're openly saying this
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:40.520]  no question about it because you see government once government starts spending
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:44.560]  money I mean your money let's not forget when government starts spending your
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:49.520]  money on health care it thinks that the best way of making the service cheaper
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:52.920]  and getting better value for money is not through the actual service it provides
[02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:59.480]  but by spending a fortune on advertising and and measures to forcing
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:03.120]  individual free individuals to behaving in a way that conforms with the
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:09.120]  government's idea of health so you know abnormal behavior is is not allowed
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:13.720]  anymore you have to eat lettuce and live like a rabbit and and not drink
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:17.680]  alcohol anymore it definitely not smoke or you won't get you know treat it you
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:22.320]  won't get your medical treatment that you paid for and that's why they love to
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:26.520]  collect device things because then they get all of the rabble that's on the
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:31.840]  dull angry at not just people with more money than them with class warfare but
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:36.240]  now they're not just angry about the plastic bags or your big car now they're
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:39.880]  looking at what you're ordering yeah of course yeah the other thing you get is
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:43.400]  I mean I don't know how familiar I look with this you're gonna get lots of health
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:47.320]  tourism I mean the number of health tourists we get from the third world
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:51.840]  coming over here sneaking into the system and you know getting treatment that
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:58.080]  they haven't paid for is you know it costs the British checker a lot of money
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:02.120]  so our service goes down and down and down and you either you have to wait
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:07.280]  longer and longer and longer for treatment by the way I just pulled this
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:12.480]  article up I have seen scores of cases in Kansas City but also at Walter Reed
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:17.000]  another part of the country in fact here's the Washington Post Pentagon is
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.800]  probing veterans home the government accountability office warned the Pentagon
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:24.680]  this week that residents of a home may be at risk in line of allegations of
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:28.200]  severe health care problems residents have been admitted to Walter Reed Army
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:32.560]  Medical Center with the most serious type of pressure sores and in one case this
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:37.080]  is one of many with maggots in a wound a bunch of vets have died from a special
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:42.680]  type of fly that goes up into the nose and lays eggs in the mucus membrane and
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:47.480]  then they have a meal of your brain so I guess we're getting screw worms now that
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:51.520]  we eradicated for cows now feasting on the vets the one place where the
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:57.240]  government does run the health care and it's absolutely abhorrent
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:02.800]  yeah well I mean this is a welcome to our world this is what it's been like
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:09.240]  for the last last 50 years in in in Britain you know I mean people in this
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:12.760]  country are very sentimental about the National Health Service they they see it
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:16.920]  as this free service and they look on America with horror many people go well
[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:20.720]  that's an awful place where you know if you get run over by a car the first thing
[02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:23.800]  that happens is you get checked whether you've got medical insurance well I mean
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:26.720]  that's not quite fair is it I don't think I don't think anyone gets turned away
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:30.800]  and allowed to die by no that's asinine you go directly to the emergency room
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:37.000]  it's all free yeah yeah exactly you know I I think you know you've opened the
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:40.320]  floodgates here I didn't know how much it's gonna cost the American taxpayer
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:44.880]  well James stay there because I want to talk to you about how it's enforced in
[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:50.120]  England because we all copy each other in tyranny do the worst aspects of each

[02:21:11.800 --> 02:21:16.000]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:20.720]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:26.000]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:30.520]  attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:35.200]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:39.240]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:42.920]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:48.000]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:10.240]  Coming up in the next segment we're going to dovetail the environmental
[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:14.200]  population reduction movement in with the government health care because they're
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:18.000]  on record saying well the case for killing granny the cover of Newsweek
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:22.080]  shows an image of a plug pulled out of a wall and says we got to get rid of old
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:26.200]  people that's how we'll fix health care so first they collectivize then they
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:30.560]  start cutting massively but you talked about hospitals where people for two
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:34.120]  three weeks aren't given baths same thing with the VA where the government
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:38.360]  runs it how do they enforce it in England they just take the tax money
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:43.080]  with other taxes because here they're saying the IRS is now going to be our
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:48.720]  nanny and basically run our lives. Oh yeah we have no choice I mean our tax
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:54.160]  tax burden has risen enormously in the last 12-13 years under our
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:25:00.320]  socialist government and they've spent more and more of our money on this
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:05.000]  creaking health system which has not improved one job so it's got more and
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.320]  more expensive it's acquired more and more layers of management particularly
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:13.680]  so that you've got you've got more and more bureaucrats for every hospital bed
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:20.040]  and fewer and fewer actual nurses so the system has got you know this is
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:24.360]  socialism in action you get you get bureaucrats paid for a taxpayer's
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:29.000]  expense and the system gets worse and worse and worse and you have no say in
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:32.640]  in in the matter you know you can't complain about the service you get
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:37.840]  because as I said you are treated like a supplicant not like a customer. So you
[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:42.000]  pay for it with tax money but that's not good enough and then third world
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:47.960]  populations pour in who are on the dole and and and don't even in many cases
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:52.080]  work and it gets more and more bankrupt where is this headed in England so we
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:57.280]  can get an idea where it's headed here. Our country is going the way of
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:03.040]  Greece we have a massive structural deficit you know running into billions
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:07.720]  of pounds and the government our government is not faced up to the fact
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:14.160]  that it cannot afford to spend any more of taxpayers money I mean already the
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:19.800]  public sector of the economy is now has now just overtaken the private sector
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:24.400]  which means that you know more well I mean for obvious reasons you if you've
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:31.000]  got ordinary hard-working businessmen and people supporting more than 50 51
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.320]  percent of the economy you have a recipe for financial disaster and this is
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:39.760]  what's happening now we can't afford the NHS we can't afford we can't afford
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:47.000]  anything really we are a nation of bureaucrats and the government's just
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  getting started they've got the snoops that dig through your trash I saw
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.040]  headlines the recruiting seven-year-olds report on their parents they're making
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:01.080]  don't even get me started on the environment you know we have all three
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:06.320]  of our major political parties in Britain from the same eco-fascist him
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:11.760]  sheets you know we must reduce carbon we must put up more wind farms we must you
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:17.960]  know we must do this we must that we are living in a topsy-turvy universe in
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:22.800]  which on the one hand our politicians are saying we must we must flash public
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:26.880]  spending we can't afford to go on like this and the other they are talking
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:32.200]  about all these crazed schemes like carbon capture carbon capture does not
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:37.920]  work they are talking about spending four billion pounds four billion pounds on
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:44.480]  trying to create clean coal plants will clean coal carbon capture burying carbon
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:48.320]  under carbon dioxide underneath the soil from American researchers have looked
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:53.600]  into this it is not possible it does not work so that is called
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:59.000]  urinating four billion pounds of your taxpayer money against the wall what
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:02.680]  about Australia where they announced millions of acres of people's own land
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:07.880]  that they can't run sheep and cows on and they just say that's the way it is
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:13.520]  yeah I know I know this is this is rather pandering to your listeners view of
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:21.600]  the world I have to say I'm trying to agree that we are seeing if we have we
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:25.560]  have seen in the last decade and it is growing growing and more and more we are
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:28.960]  seeing the approach of one world government all these different
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:33.600]  bureaucracies around the world they are conspiring to take away our freedom and
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:38.280]  I fear very much for what's going to happen in the next in the next decade
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:45.640]  you know I think unless we resist certainly intellectually and perhaps
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:49.280]  eventually it has to be physically I don't know what's going to happen we are
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:54.440]  going to be end up in a little global tyranny more than a year ago you
[02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:59.280]  published the book welcome to Obama land I have seen your future and it
[02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:05.200]  doesn't work and I'm not even confident that that Republicans when they get into
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:10.640]  power in a couple years won't repeal this I mean you talk about your big three
[02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:16.440]  parties your Tories they're all going along with it because the same big
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:20.160]  problems and I have to say Alex I am rather relying on you Americans to save
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:25.560]  our sorry asses because you are I only hope over here we live in the United
[02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:29.120]  Socialist Republic of Europe you know Europe makes all our decisions now and
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:34.840]  and Europe is is stuffed to the gills with socialist bureaucrats who want
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:38.760]  nothing better than to take away individual liberty increase taxes
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:44.320]  increase regulation so we are screwed as far as you know James yeah I want to get

[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:38.920]  dovetail into the overall mindset of these people in fact I have articles
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:44.240]  here where they say lowering our carbon footprint destroying industry will save
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:48.240]  the earth and that and that we do need to reduce population and then we have
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:54.040]  this Canadian prestigious study done and again here are the headlines how going
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:58.880]  green may make you mean ethical consumers less likely to be kind and more
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:03.720]  likely to steal massively more likely to steal so that's the guardian who are
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:08.080]  basically made up of a lot of these people admitting it it's not just James
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:12.920]  Dillingpole writing about it but James has been saying these very things for
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:15.760]  four or five years and I've been reading his column since I've been aware of him
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:19.400]  James how did you know this about them I guess you have the same experience as I
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:24.520]  did but let's find out and then be let's get into this study in detail well I
[02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:29.520]  think I think Alex it all fits into the bigger picture I think this rule doesn't
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:37.560]  just apply to greens it applies to lip tards Marxist do good as generally people
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:44.200]  of the liberal left generally feel that because they vote for a form of
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:50.400]  government which involves wealth distribution which involves government
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:55.960]  punishing the rich and making rules they feel that is their moral get out of
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:01.000]  jail free I think you know conservatives are much more honest about the facts of
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:05.640]  life they're much more they believe much more in personal responsibility and I
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:09.320]  think for that because conservatives believe in personal responsibility they
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:15.280]  hold themselves to higher standards of behavior than liberals do that jail with
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:19.960]  your experience absolutely and I don't even call them liberals there it's a
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:25.560]  control freak cult who hates everyone and loves to run people's lives yes
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:31.920]  absolutely absolutely it's you know I think that liberals have a or what
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:38.760]  call them what you will watermelons Marxist whatever they have a very
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:44.040]  depressing view of human nature which is that we are all so essentially evil
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:48.680]  that the only way that we can be coerced into good behavior is for the government
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:52.840]  to step in and rule our lives and I think they include themselves you know
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:57.120]  subconsciously they think that they they think of themselves as these flawed
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:02.520]  corrupted people so they feel the need to behave well in the same way that you
[02:38:02.520 --> 02:38:05.400]  were I might you know I mean I feel ultimately I'm going to be judged for
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:10.080]  my behavior I expect people to behave well towards me as I behave well
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:13.520]  towards them you're you're looked at doesn't care about that because hey
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:17.120]  that's what that's government's job it's government's job to police behavior and
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:20.920]  if you can get away with it as in this you know this is rather interesting
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:26.720]  research from Canada where this experiment was done on all these these
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:30.320]  students and they divided them into various control groups and they discovered
[02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:36.800]  that where are we let's let's see it says later in an honor system in which
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:40.640]  participants were asked to take money from an envelope to pay themselves their
[02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:47.360]  spoils the greens was six times more likely to steal than the conventionals
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:51.400]  this is a psychological experiment but I think I think we all know where it's
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:56.560]  coming from he just it's born out by our daily lives is it not well it is but
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:03.160]  expanding on that I think it's even worse talking to these people they see
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:08.240]  themselves as powerless scum who never have any future who are very envious and
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:13.060]  hateful whereas a more libertarian or classical conservative has a high view
[02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:17.560]  of themselves and enjoys life and like seeing others do well I mean that's how
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:22.760]  I am I never thought of myself as some special good guy this was just who I was
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:27.880]  in my parents and my culture time being eaten up with envy about other people
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:31.080]  doing well but they think well that's how this is to work some people do do
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:35.320]  better than others and normally through exactly it's an envy it's an envy base
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:40.400]  thing so they feel that they get power through the state they feel like that
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:44.560]  it's their state their government it's an extension of them they're they're
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:49.120]  living vicariously through Stalin or through Obama or through Mal
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:53.440]  that's that's totally true I would say the very worst the lowest of all vermin
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:57.760]  I'm afraid to say are the watermelons the the the Marxists who essentially moved
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:02.680]  into the green movement and co-opted it for their own ends because I see you know
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:07.520]  I spent a lot of time arguing with these people what strikes me about about the
[02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:12.760]  majority of dark green you know eco fascists that I have met is that they
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:18.560]  really do not care about nature and they loathe mankind you know they are not in
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:23.080]  it to save the world they are in it to punish the human species for their
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:28.040]  outrageous cheek in existing on the planet they think we are a blot on the
[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:34.400]  landscape they want population controls they want to carpet the countryside with
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:40.160]  with wind farms they want the government to regulate and they are quite happy for
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:45.000]  the global economy to be bombed back to the dark ages in the name of saving the
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  planet but they don't want to save the planet they want to destroy the world in
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:53.480]  fact well I mean absolutely I mean it's not just morey strong it's it's
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:58.360]  Pachari it's the UN it's the biological diversity assessment 96 it's
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:02.760]  don't forget the WWF who are very much part of this yeah let's talk about the
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:08.960]  Nazi founder of that Prince Bernhard who then got caught using World Wildlife
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:15.960]  Fund cover in in ivory sales I mean again most of them don't consciously know
[02:41:15.960 --> 02:41:21.680]  this is a fraud they consciously know that it's a eugenics movement
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:27.080]  well it's riddled with it and of course not as strong as it was it was I think he is closely
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:30.960]  associated with the World Wildlife Fund you think about it when I was growing up
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:36.520]  in the 1970s I was very familiar with that cute little panda you know the panda
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:41.200]  motif you know I think every child in the world is brought up to think of the
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:46.840]  World Wildlife Fund as as this caring sharing organization which has nothing
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:51.600]  more than the world's best interests apart this is an organization whose
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:58.160]  income is currently what it's about I'd say about 300 no more than that
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:03.080]  must be about four hundred thousand four hundred million pounds a year so what's
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:07.120]  that that's about five hundred and fifty million dollars a year more than
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:14.640]  that it's about it's about six hundred and fifty six million dollars a year
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:17.920]  that's its income and with the story that when you caught in the British
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:22.800]  press the week there's nothing cuddly about the WWF they have brought up
[02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:31.680]  ways of the Amazonian rainforest and they reckon that if the carbon
[02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:35.440]  trading gets enforced by government the carbon regulation gets rarer to through
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:41.080]  by the likes of Obama then the World Wildlife Fund stands to make sixty
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:47.440]  billion dollars sixty billion dollars how scary is that this is an elected
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:53.360]  organization over who voters have no control whatsoever with a with a Marxist
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:58.160]  agenda in control of that kind of well let me expand on that I keep going back
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:06.680]  to where I live and my upfront front row seat to this growing up you know in
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:10.880]  Austin since high school every week bang bang bang on the door young
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:16.280]  environmentalist gouging and and and and shaming my mother into giving them
[02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:21.240]  money for SOS save our Springs has nothing to do with Bull Creek and the
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:26.200]  spring-fed pool called Barton Springs and the city of Austin stole more than
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:31.280]  20,000 acres from citizens paid them pennies on the dollar and then all the
[02:43:31.280 --> 02:43:37.560]  local green leadership literally did deals to basically sell at reduced
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:42.840]  prices or give themselves the land they own their own banks and they're making
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:46.680]  hundreds of millions of dollars a year in the West Austin area where they
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:53.080]  stole all this land and now it's hotels and million-dollar homes and I mean
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:58.600]  they are conscious thieves and and they know it I mean this is just look
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:03.080]  there's nothing even green or liberal about them it is a cloak for their
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:08.240]  authoritarian tyranny this is a wrecking crew of hardcore criminals well it's not
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:16.840]  like we didn't know Alex's ever never trust a hippie look well not only do
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:21.960]  they smell but they also steal your money and it was ever though it's
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:26.400]  certainly been been that case into this woodstock well I want to expand on that
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:31.200]  though you got a lot of useful hippies that mean well and they all got mad
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:35.200]  once the banks ripped them off and didn't turn it into a big park they just
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:38.640]  hated the people that owned the property but now they're even more mad but
[02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:42.240]  they're not marched up to the front of the city council anymore and told their
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:46.880]  angels they've been many of them banned from even speaking in Austin at the
[02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:52.240]  council you could be living in California I mean that truly is a green
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:56.160]  Marxist paradise isn't it you know you've only got a tiny bit of your state
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:59.760]  being taken over by the libtards but the poor California has just been completely
[02:44:59.760 --> 02:45:05.240]  wiped out by it yeah the mayor of L.A. said a 28% increase in the first year on
[02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:11.040]  your power bill yeah I think I think you may have to encourage California to
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:15.600]  succeed from America for the rest of America and and allow it to go bankrupt
[02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:18.600]  and allow them to stew in their own juices and see the error of their waves
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:22.480]  and then you know get a proper a proper governor in a sort of Regan style
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:28.160]  governor who brings them back from the brink and but instead James California as
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:33.120]  you know well the UN talks about this tax havens they want to make all the rest
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:38.560]  of the country like that and they say oh this socialism will only work once no
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:43.440]  one can run and that's what the New World Order is is a globe run by these
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:46.920]  people where there's nowhere to run because wherever the hard-working
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:53.360]  people go that becomes a a a wonderful place and wherever the parasites are
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:56.880]  vampires can't feed on vampires
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:02.120]  James is your phone cut I was saying I thought you'd go I thought I'd lost no no
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:06.560]  I was saying I was saying vampires can't feed on vampires no I know who would
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:09.760]  have thought who would have thought you know ten years ago that the only place
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:13.840]  in the world safe to flee to now is Canada I mean Canada is about the only
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:18.680]  country in the world which is not buying all this eco-fascist nonsense and the
[02:46:18.680 --> 02:46:24.520]  reason is that they're sitting on loads of of oil and that they live in a
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:28.920]  country which is so cold that no way would any government get away with
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:34.080]  enforcing the kind of fuel bill hikes that we have to accept in the rest of
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:38.240]  the world because you know people people couldn't afford to eat their homes I'm
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:44.680]  afraid to say that the America Europe even Australia is going down this this
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:50.720]  greeny sinkhole I'm not sure I'm not sure how we escape from this well the
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:54.200]  good news is they've been exposed as frauds briefly because you've been
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:58.960]  chronicling this there's a new scandal every two or three days as big or bigger
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:06.360]  than the climategate emails and now I was reading last week where they're the
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:12.160]  UN's going to Hollywood saying save us no one believes us anymore Obama can't
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.600]  get his bill right yeah I mean but you know what really frightens me in all
[02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:21.320]  this Alex we okay we've had the climategate scandal and it and a lot of
[02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:25.360]  publicity that we've had since we've had Amazon Gate and Glacier Gate and
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:31.320]  the Chowry Gate and Africa Gate and and Holland Gate always always revelations
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:38.120]  which show that the the UN the IPCC has been lying to us constantly you know
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:41.680]  these scientists have been exaggerating the extent of global warming but what
[02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:49.800]  has actually happened to derail the the HEW bandwagon nothing we have still all
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:54.400]  the governments in the world conspiring to commit us to ever greater
[02:47:54.400 --> 02:48:01.040]  regulation ever greater carbon reductions ever greater taxes I I've
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:05.760]  hoping that one good thing will emerge out of Obama care and that is that I'm
[02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:10.960]  hoping that it will strengthen the will of real conservatives in America to make
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:16.160]  this Obama's last success because the real battle is going to be fought over
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:20.680]  over cap and trade that's the battle you've got to fight and win well I agree
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:24.520]  with you I mean if people think government grabbing health care is bad
[02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:29.640]  and the IRS to enforce it compared to the multi-thousand page bill that's
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:33.440]  already passed the house home inspections if you don't fix your house in one
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:38.760]  week no judge no jury the government can just take your home going to jail for
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:46.760]  light bulbs batteries trash inspectors they mean business here and and if
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:52.720]  health care won't shut the economy down then certainly this green power grab
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:57.240]  will and I'm sure you saw the Audi commercials about the green police the
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:00.880]  mayor of San Francisco where that was produced said this isn't a joke this is
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:08.760]  what we want to do we want to turn boards of authoritarians to you if you
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:15.200]  lose the battle on cap and trade if cap and trade passes the world is doomed
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:19.760]  that is it you've got to make sure that Obama is a one-term president number one
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:24.600]  and number two you've got to make sure that the guy who replaces him or girl and
[02:49:24.600 --> 02:49:31.120]  maybe maybe the does not buy into this this watermelon nonsense because it is
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:35.600]  going to be a disaster okay but but hold on Gordon Brown heading up the G20
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:38.280]  says they're gonna have a world constitution of banks they're gonna
[02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:42.560]  raise the money for climate taxes from the nations unilaterally outside of
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:47.720]  legislation and that this is just the way it is Obama agrees what do we do when
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:53.720]  they just lawlessly do whatever they want well I think what we have at the
[02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:57.840]  moment at least is is the power of free speech and I know that a lot of the
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:50:01.520]  ideas that are discussed on your show and discussed on the internet are very
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:05.480]  different from the kind of nonsense that our governments are conspiring to tell
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:10.360]  us that gives me hope I every day I get more and more emails from people who

[02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:33.600]  conspiring together they all believe in big government and we don't we think of
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:37.080]  it with the taxation well of course their government bureaucrats and

[02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:28.240]  happened but they've said this and that they're gonna incrementally put it into
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:33.080]  place so that you don't feel the pain they know it was unpopular over 70% of
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:38.240]  the country and polls against it they don't care and a lot of people are
[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:42.760]  saying this is finally woken their eyes up woken their eyes up finally made them
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:49.120]  open their eyes and woken them up to be able to really understand that this is
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:52.960]  only the beginning this is how tyranny works James I mean you've studied
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:58.840]  tyranny you studied history one book I read recently I think with your
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:05.080]  familiar with it a book by a Frenchman called Gustave Le Bon the crowd it was
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:09.240]  called a study of the popular mind and this book was written in 1895 and it
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:15.000]  was the first book to analyze the the way a crowd thinks and it was a big
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.280]  influence this book on both Hitler Mussolini and Freud so it's it's
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:24.040]  remarkably modern in it in its insights and what this book says is that in order
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:29.440]  to manipulate a crowd you must first understand the crowd is only as only as
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:34.600]  clever as the most stupid person in it so what you must do is not use logic or
[02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:39.200]  reason or anything like that what you must do is repeat something over and
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:43.480]  over again until the crowd believes you and this is what's happened with with
[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:48.480]  global warming for example we've got Al Gore with his propaganda movie you know
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:52.920]  an inconvenient truth you know his version of triumph of the will where
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:58.480]  he says the science is settled and if you repeat this soothing phrase over and
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:03.320]  over again you know the consensus says twenty thousand scientists say you know
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:08.600]  etc etc the globe the world is heating up what happened is that gradually this
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:12.800]  idea gets absorbed by the whole of society and people start thinking yes
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:18.240]  we must do something we must act but what Gustave Le Bon also says is that
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:24.640]  there comes a point where the prestige of the demagogue who is who is spouting
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:30.280]  this nonsense if that becomes threatened at any point then his
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:34.480]  overthrow can happen very very dramatically and very suddenly and I
[02:56:34.480 --> 02:56:38.520]  think we it is quite possible the way the way people are understanding that
[02:56:38.520 --> 02:56:41.800]  was global warming now the way you know listeners on your show readers of my
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:47.520]  blog I think we could be approaching this wonderful pivotal moment where we see
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:53.320]  Al Gore swinging from a lab post absolutely I mean the bigger they are
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:57.880]  the harder they fall and this is an all or nothing exercise by this criminal
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:03.120]  class of collectivists that are becoming fabulously wealthy and and and
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:06.720]  powerful from this and that's why they're so dedicated that's why they've
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:11.700]  invested so much and they know the score and we see their fraud falling like
[02:57:11.700 --> 02:57:17.280]  dominoes so now they're trying to trust in the police state and apathy to carry
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:24.000]  him through but but no tyranny has ever stood carbon is I think trading
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:29.040]  something like you know 10 cents of money but it's the carbon market is has
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:32.040]  reached rock bottom and of course you know you've got even the British
[02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:35.720]  Conservatives the government the government conservatives who are about
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:38.960]  to become the next government unfortunately who are saying yes we
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:43.040]  must we must have a floor price on carbon in order to regulate the markets
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:47.440]  blah blah blah there are lots of people who are very lots of rich canny
[02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:52.680]  investors like Al Gore like George Soros who are very heavily exposed to the
[02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:56.440]  carbon trading market but you can pay your bottom dollar Alex that there are
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:02.760]  also out there a lot of very very clever investors who are backing the other who
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:06.800]  backing quite the opposite there are people out there who shorting carbon
[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:11.720]  yeah people out there who are going to make money by betting that the carbon
[02:58:11.720 --> 02:58:16.480]  market is going to fail you know and I think those the people who I who I
[02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:20.540]  think are making the right call I reckon that this thing this whole thing is
[02:58:20.540 --> 02:58:23.600]  going to collapse but I do not think that they are going to be able to get away
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:28.000]  with imposing this global carbon tyranny on us all that's what I'm praying for

[03:00:47.640 --> 03:00:52.760]  the power and control that comes with it let's talk to Annie in Indiana Annie
[03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:59.160]  you're on the air hi Alex hi I'm a senior citizen over 60 and I'm also a
[03:00:59.160 --> 03:01:07.600]  Texan in Indiana I'm so old I remember when you came on the air that dates me
[03:01:07.600 --> 03:01:13.600]  doesn't it I know I'm familiar with some of the proposals and president
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:18.040]  Sotero's death care bill and I was going to ask you if you know if he's carried
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:20.640]  over I have no reason to believe that might have been taken out I want to
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:27.320]  give you a quick scenario go ahead say I am over 60 and I'm in a good health have
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:32.280]  insurance I'm hit in a car accident by an illegal drunk alien with no health
[03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:36.840]  insurance that no car insurance that would provide me with any medical care I
[03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:41.080]  have my own health insurance I'm laying up with a broken body in the ER through
[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:45.000]  no fault of my own I have a broken leg and say my face is smashed up and I need
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:52.120]  eye surgery it's my understanding that at any age if I am not current in my
[03:01:52.120 --> 03:01:57.320]  vaccinations immunizations and including the swine flu shot that I will
[03:01:57.320 --> 03:02:02.200]  receive no needed health care at all my broken leg will not be set and being over
[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:07.920]  60 I will receive no needed eye surgery even if I do have current yes
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:14.400]  they did have specific areas in there previously what they did was leave an
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:18.880]  open door to what they call comparative care where with the big insurance
[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:23.760]  companies and with the federal government they will decide what care you
[03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:30.880]  get and they use examples of women below 45 don't need a mammogram or you know
[03:02:30.880 --> 03:02:37.840]  you don't get a colonoscopy till you're 50 and it sounds you know kind of
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:42.720]  non-threatening but it gives them the power to do all this and we know what
[03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:47.680]  Europe's done we know what Tom Daschle said how this should be implemented that
[03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:54.680]  yes they want to then let the bioethicist board decide that Annie doesn't
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:58.960]  really deserve all this extra care that should go to somebody younger and so
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:03.160]  they will be given liability protection and yes there were provisions I don't
[03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:05.720]  know if they were in the new one I haven't had time to read the 2700 pages
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:09.960]  entirely to where if you didn't have all your vaccinations and things they
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:14.440]  could try to refuse your care go ahead and might some of the insurance companies
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:18.480]  pick that up and say gee we can we'll have to cancel your private insurance if
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:21.720]  you're not current on on your vaccinations under the new government
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:25.280]  yes and there's also federal standardization in there to where the
[03:03:25.280 --> 03:03:28.880]  government says it's part of policy that you have to take an implantable ship
[03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:32.520]  while you're in the hospital that is in the bill I appreciate your call good
[03:03:32.520 --> 03:03:35.880]  up point Brian and Canada Brian you're on the air

[03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:01.680]  that bill on yesterday and I just wanted to say that it's time for calm I wanted
[03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:05.000]  to say the Bible says doubt shot not fall and fall a multitude to do evil
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:12.400]  exodus 23 to so first of all this time for calm not for getting violent well

[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:27.960]  but on Facebook I have no first that is go ahead okay so what I've done is on
[03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:33.360]  Friday I was inspired to write a sample letter to congressman and you are
[03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:36.960]  right in that when you say that the battle isn't within the states it's not
[03:04:36.960 --> 03:04:40.480]  I'm with the federal government anymore it's with the states that's where it will

[03:07:56.120 --> 03:08:03.160]  the web e-foods direct comm slash Alex the Genesis Communications radio
[03:08:03.160 --> 03:08:08.760]  network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your
[03:08:08.760 --> 03:08:15.480]  mind I've done a lot of research on all five versions and I'm not gonna lie to
[03:08:15.480 --> 03:08:20.160]  you I haven't read all 2700 pages I've listened to all the debate researched
[03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:28.600]  it scan through it this is the worst bill of the fine some would say well
[03:08:28.600 --> 03:08:31.720]  wait it's a better bill it doesn't have a public option if you're gonna have
[03:08:31.720 --> 03:08:35.240]  socialism and steal from one group you might as well actually give the money
[03:08:35.240 --> 03:08:40.640]  to somebody no the top insurance companies not the little ones the top
[03:08:40.640 --> 03:08:44.600]  ones and it's in Bloomberg today their stocks going up they're set to make
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:49.440]  massive profits because the government's giving them liability protection it lets
[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:53.200]  them lower the standard of everybody's care just like in England in Europe we
[03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:57.480]  know how this works and it gives the illegal aliens the health care it will
[03:08:57.480 --> 03:09:01.960]  further destroy the economy I'm gonna go over all of it today but Dennis
[03:09:01.960 --> 03:09:06.880]  was right a few months ago and he said this is a insurance company bailout so
[03:09:06.880 --> 03:09:11.680]  is Howard Dean but they rolled over now I was against their plan as well but at
[03:09:11.680 --> 03:09:15.240]  least they were honest about this plan being a scam now I'm gonna go to your
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:18.400]  calls I want to hear from you but also want to hear your solutions I believe
[03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:22.720]  it's the states not just the Attorney General suing but the state's passing
[03:09:22.720 --> 03:09:27.080]  laws nullifying this this is completely illegal unconstitutional the way they
[03:09:27.080 --> 03:09:31.040]  got the votes for the bill is illegal this is a criminal fraud we should have
[03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:35.520]  grand jury start criminal investigations as Ron Paul has said the evidence is
[03:09:35.520 --> 03:09:40.440]  there and this will bankrupt our country cap and trade will bankrupt it the
[03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:46.000]  Senate won't pass it so Obama says he's gonna implement it through the EPA but
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:50.040]  I'm gonna give each caller about a minute Brian and Canada said he had five
[03:09:50.040 --> 03:09:53.920]  points he wanted to make make them Brian okay I started a group on Facebook on
[03:09:53.920 --> 03:09:57.520]  Friday called forcing Obama out of office for not ending abortion and my
[03:09:57.520 --> 03:10:01.000]  the five points that I want to go through are 60% of Americans are already opposed
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:05.440]  to abortion the second point is that an unborn baby is 100% living human being
[03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:09.400]  demonstrating having living systems like necessary for life including DNA in the
[03:10:09.400 --> 03:10:14.120]  blood that's different than that of a mother and third point is that title
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:18.240]  18 part one chapter 52 section 1111 of the United States criminal code says
[03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:22.680]  that murder is the unlawful killing of a human being and that which would
[03:10:22.680 --> 03:10:26.560]  include an unborn baby the next point is that there's probably have been
[03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:29.840]  approximately 3,000 murders of unborn babies committed every day on the watch
[03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:33.360]  of Mr. Brock Obama and he's exercised nothing of his executive powers at its
[03:10:33.360 --> 03:10:36.120]  disposal acting as president of the United States to end those atrocities
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:39.280]  and whereas the Constitution of the United States this is the fifth point the
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:43.960]  Constitution says that the Congress has the ability anytime they can pass a law
[03:10:43.960 --> 03:10:46.240]  that says that the president is no longer the president and we're gonna
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:49.400]  replace them with somebody else that they deem fit all right Brian I
[03:10:49.400 --> 03:10:54.200]  appreciate your call I'm gonna get into the abortion issue Obama and his so
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:10:58.040]  called executive order the guy lies about everything an executive order
[03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:02.400]  doesn't trump congressional law and as Ron Paul said on Fox yesterday in fact I
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:06.120]  want to queue that up for later in the hour I want to play a clip of it we're
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:09.600]  already funding abortions they send federal money down in the hospitals use
[03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:13.160]  it for however they want or they'll take their abortion money and put it over
[03:11:13.160 --> 03:11:16.960]  here and then use the federal money to pay for other programs but still
[03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:21.360]  essentially paying for the abortion and that's why all the major congressional
[03:11:21.360 --> 03:11:25.720]  groups against abortion and all the major the Catholic bishops in the
[03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:30.280]  Protestant groups all of them have looked at it this is funding abortion it's
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:34.360]  making you pay for abortion and yes abortion is one of the biggest hoaxes
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:42.440]  in history 50 million dead people more since Roe v. Wade 37 years ago 51% of
[03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:45.320]  blacks are never born they kill more than half the black people in this
[03:11:45.320 --> 03:11:48.360]  country but you hear all the fake liberal black leaders never talking about
[03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:52.560]  that half the black people in this country haven't been born the last 37
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:57.840]  years I mean this is outrageous and to make people pay for this and then try
[03:11:57.840 --> 03:12:03.600]  some maneuver where they say an executive order won't let the federal funds
[03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:08.040]  go all the scholars even on both sides say that's a fraud the pro-abortion
[03:12:08.040 --> 03:12:12.480]  groups have said don't worry guys it's a scam we're still gonna get our death
[03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:17.400]  money let's talk to Don and okay Oklahoma go ahead Don thank you Alex
[03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:20.520]  have me on I was just gonna ask you is right now the time for a
[03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:26.640]  constitutional convention here's the problem with the concon they the
[03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:32.240]  states if you've got a majority of states to go for a new amendment they
[03:12:32.240 --> 03:12:36.440]  can pass whatever they want during the constitutional convention and we've
[03:12:36.440 --> 03:12:39.880]  seen a lot of globalists trying to push for once what's very dangerous what we
[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:44.360]  need to do is take control of the states have them nullify this unconstitutional
[03:12:44.360 --> 03:12:48.440]  law they're claiming the commerce clause that the government the federal
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:53.320]  government can make you buy something from a private corporation they never
[03:12:53.320 --> 03:12:56.480]  had a federal law that you've got to buy car insurance they did that the state
[03:12:56.480 --> 03:13:01.720]  level and that's still unconstitutional but not as openly unconstitutional as
[03:13:01.720 --> 03:13:06.120]  the federal government now they can say you know you've got to buy an electric
[03:13:06.120 --> 03:13:11.920]  car from GM to prop it up now they can say Obama's pushing for national service
[03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:17.280]  not just a draft but people are in denial about this I have the video clips of
[03:13:17.280 --> 03:13:22.120]  his chief of staff on C-SPAN saying all Americans will serve a national service
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:26.560]  and once they bankrupted America they're gonna use that crisis to say we've all
[03:13:26.560 --> 03:13:29.720]  got to get together in the depression you know your kids have got to work for
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:33.200]  the government the cyber security bills is they're gonna take high school kids
[03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:36.720]  and make them work for the federal government spying on people but I know
[03:13:36.720 --> 03:13:40.280]  I'm scared of a concon what do you think Don well I don't know that's why I'm
[03:13:40.280 --> 03:13:46.320]  asking you I had any other points no well I appreciate your call Don very good
[03:13:46.320 --> 03:13:54.080]  question let's talk to Matt in the United Kingdom go ahead Matt hi Alex and
[03:13:54.080 --> 03:13:59.480]  welcome to you Jennings Britain listen to you and James there are what two
[03:13:59.480 --> 03:14:04.000]  questions actually I reckon the Britain energy system is very much gonna get
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:09.760]  like yours in America if you can't pay for medical care then obviously it's the
[03:14:09.760 --> 03:14:13.000]  endgame and it's the degenics thing and also in the UK what they're doing now
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:17.240]  Alex is they just did they're handing out leaflets saying we are gonna pass your
[03:14:17.240 --> 03:14:21.400]  medical details in exchange in between different doctors and the hospital
[03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:25.760]  services to obviously think if you're a beast or you think our goal again is
[03:14:25.760 --> 03:14:29.560]  another eugenics problem watch out no no it's the nanny state where they tax
[03:14:29.560 --> 03:14:36.240]  beer salt beef they they track every facet of your lives and as you know you
[03:14:36.240 --> 03:14:40.600]  live in England it's been in the news some people will rot for a month and
[03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:44.600]  die in their beds look at the one area in the US where the government ran
[03:14:44.600 --> 03:14:48.960]  healthcare and it's the worst healthcare in the nation the VA hospitals and the
[03:14:48.960 --> 03:14:52.760]  more money they throw at it the VA hospital on average gets more money
[03:14:52.760 --> 03:14:56.480]  per patient than any other even private group but they give the worst care
[03:14:56.480 --> 03:15:03.120]  because it's all going to bureaucracy and the parasites in government yeah
[03:15:03.120 --> 03:15:07.240]  I mean also what people doing now we've got a thing the private private medical
[03:15:07.240 --> 03:15:10.520]  care thing called Boopa don't if you've heard about it and basically what
[03:15:10.520 --> 03:15:14.760]  obviously did the direction of stock is here obviously going to Boopa because
[03:15:14.760 --> 03:15:21.080]  obviously not in NHS is obviously faltering and and I'm falling absolutely
[03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:24.560]  always create a two-tier system where the elite can still get their healthcare
[03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:29.480]  great points from the UK Matt Damon in South Carolina you're on the air hey
[03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:35.520]  call from South Carolina I you know I I don't want to sound like dooming gloom
[03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:39.920]  but I'm really concerned because we had Mark Samford Lovermer Haydom try and
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:46.360]  refuse to take the stimulus money and you had all the the bulk of the Congress
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:51.000]  of the state Congress in South Carolina basically put him up before the Supreme
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:55.840]  Court and made him take the money you know so well Kelly at Spitzer he was
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:15:59.800]  not perfect as the governor of New York but he exposed the banker bailout as a
[03:15:59.800 --> 03:16:03.080]  fraud and they were surveilling him you knew he was visiting hookers and
[03:16:03.080 --> 03:16:07.680]  selectively busted him look at your governor I mean yeah I mean I'm not
[03:16:07.680 --> 03:16:12.440]  saying it's good to cheat on his wife but compared to all the other things you
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:16.280]  know Barney Frank can have underage callboys in his house and that's okay
[03:16:16.280 --> 03:16:20.560]  because he's a globalist but then your governor goes out and and and cheats on
[03:16:20.560 --> 03:16:24.560]  his wife and it's as if he's Satan exactly and I think what you're gonna
[03:16:24.560 --> 03:16:29.080]  find is that no matter any state that has the you know the guts to stand up to
[03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:32.800]  Obama and his brown shirts right now they're just gonna go down they'll
[03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:36.320]  they'll they'll cut their funding they won't you know they'll do whatever they
[03:16:36.320 --> 03:16:39.680]  have to do that's why we have the states and the legislatures they can't get
[03:16:39.680 --> 03:16:43.280]  everybody in the legislature and when the people are behind them that's why
[03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:48.120]  they nullify and start keeping their money this is our money the federal
[03:16:48.120 --> 03:16:51.320]  government has made us dependent because the federal government is run by
[03:16:51.320 --> 03:16:54.880]  offshore corporations that's what we've got to make the republicans talk about
[03:16:54.880 --> 03:16:58.560]  this isn't a bunch of communist oh it's communist at the ground level to get
[03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:02.720]  control of us this is the biggest most wealthy interest that want monopolies
[03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:08.440]  anything else one more thing I think the the ultimate solution here and and we
[03:17:08.440 --> 03:17:11.960]  haven't heard much from them is the doctors of this country either they're
[03:17:11.960 --> 03:17:17.760]  all getting a doctor or there or if they don't all go on strike and just say
[03:17:17.760 --> 03:17:21.360]  you know what we're not gonna take your government plan all right we didn't
[03:17:21.360 --> 03:17:26.720]  go we didn't want to happen you've got Walgreens and many of its chain stores
[03:17:26.720 --> 03:17:30.720]  saying we're not gonna accept April 16th and pass that Seattle Post
[03:17:30.720 --> 03:17:35.440]  intelligence or Seattle Times excuse me reported that last Friday because the
[03:17:35.440 --> 03:17:39.800]  compensation isn't enough to even pay for it and so a lot of doctors are just

[03:24:34.640 --> 03:24:39.880]  voters in the states where the senators voted for the healthcare bill trying to
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:48.240]  recall their senators that are elected in 2012 and 2014 well until 1913 with the
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:53.920]  17th Amendment we elected the legislators to our state houses and they then
[03:24:53.920 --> 03:24:58.240]  voted for the senators and they would routinely recall them not just to remove
[03:24:58.240 --> 03:25:02.320]  them but to interrogate them or to make them change their vote they were truly
[03:25:02.320 --> 03:25:06.600]  creatures of the states that's why that was such a tyrannical amendment of the
[03:25:06.600 --> 03:25:11.720]  17th Amendment but absolutely recall senators recall House members take our
[03:25:11.720 --> 03:25:17.720]  states back get aggressive do the same thing that was done to Gray Davis but
[03:25:17.720 --> 03:25:20.920]  notice they were waiting with Swartz and anger the gun grabbing open border
[03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:25.520]  promoting fake environmentalist but no I mean we we can't just let the Attorney
[03:25:25.520 --> 03:25:30.200]  General sue over this the states have to stand up that's the number one
[03:25:30.200 --> 03:25:34.200]  solution and the lawsuits have to be filed the discrimination and the Cadillac
[03:25:34.200 --> 03:25:39.320]  plans or the big labor unions are exempt their plans don't get touched the
[03:25:39.320 --> 03:25:45.960]  payoffs to politicians the pork barrel to get this through this unconstitutional
[03:25:45.960 --> 03:25:51.800]  executive order now so I mean if this is if this stands presidents will have
[03:25:51.800 --> 03:25:57.520]  executive orders to amend to legislate the executive branch doesn't let doesn't
[03:25:57.520 --> 03:26:06.600]  legislate okay thank you good point Sam Jerry and Louisiana you're on the air
[03:26:06.600 --> 03:26:13.800]  hello how are you good sir good deal two points of view from the south first
[03:26:13.800 --> 03:26:17.640]  thing I just appreciate what you're doing and you know something about people
[03:26:17.640 --> 03:26:21.840]  believe they're gonna get a free thing no matter what it is and people think it
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:25.440]  all comes from the government and we know it comes from the people the other
[03:26:25.440 --> 03:26:30.800]  day I was listening to one of the other talks so a host and I won't name who but
[03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:33.680]  he was talking about how nobody knows what's in the bill well nobody knows
[03:26:33.680 --> 03:26:37.720]  what's in the bill and so I called in I said well I know what's in the bill the
[03:26:37.720 --> 03:26:44.800]  how the pharmaceuticals and insurance companies wrote the bill and then he
[03:26:44.800 --> 03:26:49.440]  says yeah they were taking down this road and misunderstood what was going on
[03:26:49.440 --> 03:26:53.320]  he really didn't know what to say so I just want to tell you I appreciate the
[03:26:53.320 --> 03:26:58.040]  truth and what you're saying and how you bring it out and I'm not for baby
[03:26:58.040 --> 03:27:02.280]  killing and I'm not for that type of thing you're right on the mark and what
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:06.800]  you've said over the years is true and and I just keep plugging in there and
[03:27:06.800 --> 03:27:10.640]  you are making headway I just want to let you know that well God bless you Jerry I
[03:27:10.640 --> 03:27:14.920]  appreciate the call and I'm gonna cover that when we come back from the break the
[03:27:14.920 --> 03:27:21.200]  the big Republican talk show hosts are telling the truth when they say this is
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:26.080]  an overthrow of our Republic this is tyranny this is authoritarianism I was
[03:27:26.080 --> 03:27:30.320]  watching congressional speeches last night after the radio show right before
[03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:35.440]  it passed and they were telling the truth but only so far it's like saying
[03:27:35.440 --> 03:27:42.440]  hey your house is on fire but not telling you who set the house on fire and the
[03:27:42.440 --> 03:27:47.080]  biggest insurance companies it's right here in Bloomberg today this is not a
[03:27:47.080 --> 03:27:51.960]  secret their stocks way up all this new out of bureaucracy is gonna shut down
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:57.600]  their competition they wrote the bill and all it does is make 30 plus million
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:02.080]  Americans buy insurance from them and the government then comes in and lowers
[03:28:02.080 --> 03:28:07.000]  the standard of care in this quote comparative care term and we know from
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:10.720]  the white papers what they mean the bill just gives the bureaucracy the power
[03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:16.240]  to do whatever they want and so the Republicans are not telling you that
[03:28:16.240 --> 03:28:22.540]  industry wrote this they're not telling the people I mean obviously if you've
[03:28:22.540 --> 03:28:25.920]  got trillions of dollars in the insurance companies that are controlled by
[03:28:25.920 --> 03:28:30.920]  banks and they've got enough power to steal tens of trillions of dollars in
[03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:35.240]  the last year and a half with the banker bailout takeover and then not say
[03:28:35.240 --> 03:28:39.320]  where the money went well this same group isn't gonna let a bunch of
[03:28:39.320 --> 03:28:44.040]  socialists and a bunch of welfare people actually get something over on them
[03:28:44.040 --> 03:28:53.360]  no there are some new taxes in there on doctors on health care equipment well
[03:28:53.360 --> 03:28:57.720]  these big corporations they don't care about that so yeah you can find some
[03:28:57.720 --> 03:29:02.400]  medium-sized small insurance companies who were against this in lobby but the
[03:29:02.400 --> 03:29:05.920]  bit of folks three months ago was in the Wall Street Journal what we already knew
[03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:10.040]  they had the spokesman this was not the Wall Street Journal saying this they
[03:29:10.040 --> 03:29:14.000]  have the spokesman I gotta pull that up because when I read his quotes from a
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:19.240]  speech I went and found it on c-span the head of the insurance company health
[03:29:19.240 --> 03:29:25.240]  care insurance company consortium saying we wrote this bill and if you put a
[03:29:25.240 --> 03:29:30.240]  public option in here which would be a supposed free lunch that the people pay
[03:29:30.240 --> 03:29:36.040]  for but a free lunch for some we're not gonna be for it what happens is the
[03:29:36.040 --> 03:29:41.480]  government lowers everybody's care look normal insurance carriers are gonna have
[03:29:41.480 --> 03:29:45.720]  higher prices then there's the taxes there's the IRS enforcing it there's the
[03:29:45.720 --> 03:29:49.720]  national ID health card initiative in there through the ID number we'll be
[03:29:49.720 --> 03:29:56.720]  right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:16.280]  embolden the criminals in government they all know they're about to be thrown
[03:33:16.280 --> 03:33:21.040]  out of Congress so why not steal even more you know I've heard people say we
[03:33:21.040 --> 03:33:24.840]  should make Congress cut their pay from a couple hundred thousand dollars a year
[03:33:24.840 --> 03:33:31.120]  or give their money back like Ron Paul does they don't spend what is it 30
[03:33:31.120 --> 03:33:36.840]  something million that Google that average congressional election cost I
[03:33:36.840 --> 03:33:43.800]  believe it's 33 million a Senate is even more they don't spend tens of
[03:33:43.800 --> 03:33:47.400]  millions of dollars to get in the House of Representatives to make $200,000 a
[03:33:47.400 --> 03:33:53.360]  year they didn't spend over a billion dollars on Obama so he could make 400
[03:33:53.360 --> 03:33:59.640]  something thousand dollars a year those guys pay millions of dollars many of
[03:33:59.640 --> 03:34:03.480]  them but Bloomberg and all his elections have spent more than a billion to be
[03:34:03.480 --> 03:34:10.600]  mayor three times and broke his promise to not run for a third term and then
[03:34:10.600 --> 03:34:20.760]  got term limits that he campaigned on the first time got it repealed just
[03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:27.040]  absolutely incredible how much money that these people spend to do this I
[03:34:27.040 --> 03:34:31.280]  want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that I'm gonna break down some
[03:34:31.280 --> 03:34:34.000]  of the most important points of what's happening with this healthcare bill and

[03:36:33.680 --> 03:36:39.360]  biggest issues here is private corporate interest who are not free market who are
[03:36:39.360 --> 03:36:45.240]  monopoly men wrote this bill so this is not even socialism which is bad enough
[03:36:45.240 --> 03:36:51.520]  as Cassinage and Dean admitted before they flip-flopped this is where the
[03:36:51.520 --> 03:36:56.720]  government might help you get insurance but everybody else and the working poor
[03:36:56.720 --> 03:37:01.400]  you've got to pay for $5,000 a year in insurance the IRS is involved in your
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:09.320]  business in your life 16,500 to 20,000 new IRS agents that's in the bill that's
[03:37:09.320 --> 03:37:13.880]  confirmed the Democrats have been on the news bragging about it so now the IRS
[03:37:13.880 --> 03:37:19.360]  becomes the nanny state you're not in a free society when the government can
[03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:27.080]  force you to buy something okay from private interest that's that's more
[03:37:27.080 --> 03:37:37.240]  akin to fascism but here's IRS dot gov whistleblower informant award IRS dot gov
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:40.880]  and I'm gonna have the document cam for prisonplanet.tv viewers zoom in it says
[03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:50.680]  you get 30% 15 to 30% of any amount of money seized when you whistleblow on
[03:37:50.680 --> 03:37:57.520]  people not paying the IRS what have we seen in the phony drug war what type of
[03:37:57.520 --> 03:38:02.440]  crime have we seen with informants lying about insurance salesman school
[03:38:02.440 --> 03:38:06.560]  teachers you name it to get drug money the cops give them a few thousand they
[03:38:06.560 --> 03:38:11.240]  say the I bought drugs from that house they rate them in fact I promise to get
[03:38:11.240 --> 03:38:17.480]  to this earlier during the next break I'll dig it out oh here it is for a
[03:38:17.480 --> 03:38:22.280]  decade or more Mexican mafia has been in all these different gangs has been
[03:38:22.280 --> 03:38:27.320]  killing people all over the country what does this have to do with this the
[03:38:27.320 --> 03:38:30.440]  police won't do anything to stop them because they're afraid of them the
[03:38:30.440 --> 03:38:36.120]  American people who roll over to anything or a better target but instead of the
[03:38:36.120 --> 03:38:40.040]  government going after the really dangerous gangs in this country that are
[03:38:40.040 --> 03:38:45.320]  now attacking police stations can you imagine if a patriot conservative or
[03:38:45.320 --> 03:38:50.120]  libertarian group pumped natural gas into the LAPD police department to blow it
[03:38:50.120 --> 03:38:54.680]  up how big a news that would be or if they rigged booby traps with guns to
[03:38:54.680 --> 03:38:58.920]  shoot cops or if they killed cops or came across the border and robbed
[03:38:58.920 --> 03:39:05.640]  sheriffs when they seized drugs Mexico is collapsing ladies and gentlemen I'm
[03:39:05.640 --> 03:39:07.800]  gonna cover this more tomorrow because I want to get back into healthcare but
[03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:15.240]  look gang crackdown vagos motorcycle club targeted in police raids and it gets
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:18.920]  into how they were caught pumping gas
[03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:24.440]  into the police department that's the main suspects in this biker gang
[03:39:24.440 --> 03:39:28.520]  investigated in booby trap mystery
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:34.040]  drilling a hole in the roof of a police building and delivering a natural gas
[03:39:34.040 --> 03:39:38.120]  line from a heater filled the space with flammable gas the trap was discovered
[03:39:38.120 --> 03:39:41.000]  before anyone was hurt
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:51.880]  $200,000 reward for info on helmet police booby traps gang tries to kill
[03:39:51.880 --> 03:39:58.760]  police on and on and on and on Mexican mafia poses danger in Arizona but no
[03:39:58.760 --> 03:40:02.680]  most of the feds that are out there and most the regular cops that are out
[03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:07.320]  there are busy cpsing people's kids because they spanked them or seizing
[03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:11.240]  people's houses for environmental groups or writing people tickets and that's in
[03:40:11.240 --> 03:40:14.280]  the news that all over the country the quotas the police have now admitted they
[03:40:14.280 --> 03:40:18.040]  have quotas they've always lied about it to write more tickets and squeeze the
[03:40:18.040 --> 03:40:23.000]  citizens are increasing and meanwhile the IRS is to enforce this through the
[03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:26.360]  healthcare bill and there's a separate provision on
[03:40:26.360 --> 03:40:32.520]  marking on people who are mowing yards or having
[03:40:32.520 --> 03:40:35.720]  that people won't believe it pull up million dollar fine
[03:40:35.720 --> 03:40:41.480]  and jail time it's fox news and ap for garage sale
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:45.240]  i want people to see that on screen and hear it on the radio because
[03:40:45.240 --> 03:40:48.600]  again we are the target the general public but the criminals that run
[03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:53.720]  society they are above the law and are being completely
[03:40:53.720 --> 03:40:56.200]  allowed
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:02.520]  to run wild okay now let me start getting in
[03:41:02.520 --> 03:41:09.080]  to a big recap on the healthcare bill and the type of control that we're
[03:41:09.080 --> 03:41:12.520]  seeing unfold here
[03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:27.240]  i'm i'm busy here trying to dig through my stack and
[03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:30.680]  get all this together i did a lot i covered a lot of this in the first hour
[03:41:30.680 --> 03:41:33.480]  and two hours yesterday but i'll definitely have to do the first two
[03:41:33.480 --> 03:41:36.360]  hours tomorrow and if we have guests we better just move them or something
[03:41:36.360 --> 03:41:40.120]  because i i i need to have some time to walk through this and i start getting
[03:41:40.120 --> 03:41:43.640]  desperate here in the last 19 minutes of the show to cover it all
[03:41:43.640 --> 03:41:46.040]  okay
[03:41:47.320 --> 03:41:50.520]  i've got all these news articles you can see on the document cam
[03:41:50.520 --> 03:41:54.520]  spread out in front of me and i've got backup with the bill
[03:41:54.520 --> 03:41:57.480]  and with the subsections on every one of these issues but i'm just going to run
[03:41:57.480 --> 03:41:59.960]  through it quickly and then tomorrow i'm going to go back
[03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:02.600]  through all this in total detail because it's so important
[03:42:02.600 --> 03:42:06.360]  i mean on this first point i happen to have the stack here in front of me
[03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:09.720]  but on other areas i need to be able to dig into the stacks because it's just a
[03:42:09.720 --> 03:42:14.040]  nightmare of proof and information there's there's too much proof
[03:42:14.040 --> 03:42:19.560]  this nation is bankrupt we owe hundreds and hundreds of times with the
[03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:23.800]  derivatives and all the rest of it what we actually produce in our gdp
[03:42:23.800 --> 03:42:27.080]  this has been done by design by the banks and they
[03:42:27.080 --> 03:42:32.840]  know it and so we cannot pay for this the nation is collapsing
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:36.600]  all our jobs are going to india china mexico and other third world nations
[03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:42.120]  that have none of this bureaucracy communist countries have much lower
[03:42:42.120 --> 03:42:49.160]  taxes than we do third world nations do the imf paints grim picture of fiscal
[03:42:49.160 --> 03:42:53.480]  tightening needs roiders where they're going to raise
[03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:57.480]  taxes but then cut your benefits just like the health care bill cuts medicare
[03:42:57.480 --> 03:43:00.280]  medicaid raises everybody's taxes who does have
[03:43:00.280 --> 03:43:04.440]  health care the irs controls and can garnish your wages or
[03:43:04.440 --> 03:43:07.800]  take your refund to your bank account
[03:43:07.800 --> 03:43:12.840]  here's another one failed banks may get pension fund backing as fdic
[03:43:12.840 --> 03:43:17.880]  cash and this is out of bloomberg and it says federal regulators are going to
[03:43:17.880 --> 03:43:22.680]  the big government police fire state and federal and saying
[03:43:22.680 --> 03:43:26.600]  we're telling you to invest in failing banks
[03:43:26.600 --> 03:43:32.520]  that's actually in this article right here that i'm going to show you a shot
[03:43:32.520 --> 03:43:37.560]  of failed banks may get pension fund
[03:43:37.560 --> 03:43:41.240]  backing as fdic's cash folks you've all got a google
[03:43:41.240 --> 03:43:45.320]  or search engine or smart page dot com this article and read it
[03:43:45.320 --> 03:43:50.760]  it says to prop it up the federal deposit insurance core is trying to
[03:43:50.760 --> 03:43:55.720]  encourage public retirement funds that control more than two trillion
[03:43:55.720 --> 03:43:58.840]  to buy all or part of failed lenders did you hear that
[03:43:58.840 --> 03:44:04.360]  they want to invest your pension that's already invested in the stock market
[03:44:04.360 --> 03:44:08.840]  and down by 40 in many cases in failed lenders
[03:44:08.840 --> 03:44:12.120]  taking a more direct role in propping up the banking system it's not propping
[03:44:12.120 --> 03:44:16.760]  them up they're stealing your money out one door
[03:44:16.760 --> 03:44:21.640]  okay here's another one this is out of business week health care overhaul adds
[03:44:21.640 --> 03:44:25.560]  millions of us customers talks about all the big four insurance companies wrote
[03:44:25.560 --> 03:44:28.200]  it and are getting all this money and power out of it
[03:44:28.200 --> 03:44:35.800]  here's another one cnbc health care stocks to outperform in the coming months
[03:44:35.800 --> 03:44:40.120]  because this is good for them here's casinos before a flip-flop saying it's
[03:44:40.120 --> 03:44:44.280]  a bailout for the insurance companies you see if the republicans
[03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:47.480]  i hear limbo every time i tune in and say how good the insurance companies how
[03:44:47.480 --> 03:44:52.440]  great they are they're a barrel of snakes at the top
[03:44:52.440 --> 03:44:57.720]  not your little local ones they're a barrel of snakes
[03:44:57.720 --> 03:45:01.160]  i saw an article where one owner of an insurance company made over a billion
[03:45:01.160 --> 03:45:04.520]  dollars last year and that's fine if they did it through free market
[03:45:04.520 --> 03:45:07.480]  but they're doing it because through medicare and medicaid and all the
[03:45:07.480 --> 03:45:10.920]  government payments was like frisk in the senate
[03:45:10.920 --> 03:45:14.600]  and all that money he made off of government contracts
[03:45:14.600 --> 03:45:20.600]  that's why this happened that's why this got passed
[03:45:20.600 --> 03:45:23.640]  but i get back to the good news 38 states are saying they're going to try to
[03:45:23.640 --> 03:45:27.000]  block it we have to make sure the states pass laws to nullify it
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:32.840]  just like this roiders article us states sue epa to stop greenhouse gas tax
[03:45:32.840 --> 03:45:36.360]  rules there's no law the bureaucrats are just doing it
[03:45:36.360 --> 03:45:40.840]  so the people are saying no all right continuing on through these points here
[03:45:40.840 --> 03:45:50.280]  another key point is this comparative medicine term
[03:45:50.280 --> 03:45:54.360]  that's the death panels that's the bioethicist boards that's tom daschle
[03:45:54.360 --> 03:45:57.560]  the original author writing you have a duty to die
[03:45:57.560 --> 03:46:02.440]  that's for people that are paying for insurance
[03:46:02.440 --> 03:46:06.120]  and could afford insurance they're going to lower your overall care for their
[03:46:06.120 --> 03:46:09.720]  profits and then pass some of that on to the illegal aliens and others
[03:46:09.720 --> 03:46:12.760]  that were marching and were called darlings by the media
[03:46:12.760 --> 03:46:16.840]  over the weekend to see we have foreigners in our country
[03:46:16.840 --> 03:46:21.000]  telling us to give them more free goodies
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:24.120]  you have how this was planned how this was rammed through
[03:46:24.120 --> 03:46:27.880]  in some cases billions of dollars of pork barrel to certain districts and
[03:46:27.880 --> 03:46:31.880]  sweetheart deals to get votes you have the fact that this is so
[03:46:31.880 --> 03:46:35.720]  unconstitutional for the government to order you to buy something you have
[03:46:35.720 --> 03:46:39.880]  that some unions and government unions are exempt from the
[03:46:39.880 --> 03:46:44.440]  Cadillac tax of 40 plus percent on people that
[03:46:44.440 --> 03:46:50.040]  have premium insurance total discrimination
[03:46:50.040 --> 03:46:54.920]  and you have the key point that the republicans
[03:46:54.920 --> 03:46:59.080]  have sold us out and supported unconstitutional measures in the past
[03:46:59.080 --> 03:47:03.320]  and are guilty of helping the democrats set this precedent
[03:47:03.320 --> 03:47:06.520]  you can't have undeclared wars you can't have the patriot act
[03:47:06.520 --> 03:47:10.360]  you can't have torture you can't have secret arrest you can't have north com
[03:47:10.360 --> 03:47:15.400]  you can't have warrantless wiretapping all of that is just as egregious and
[03:47:15.400 --> 03:47:18.840]  illegal as this health care bill you can't pick and choose
[03:47:18.840 --> 03:47:22.040]  what part of the bill of rights the constitution you like
[03:47:22.040 --> 03:47:25.800]  i hear all these idiots saying the constitution's failed no we failed
[03:47:25.800 --> 03:47:29.720]  enforcing it and we need to look at the mirror and realize it's we the people
[03:47:29.720 --> 03:47:34.440]  that take a lot of the blame in all of this
[03:47:34.440 --> 03:47:37.720]  the establishment is crowing and bragging
[03:47:37.720 --> 03:47:41.320]  on the news that they think you're going to forget about this because this is
[03:47:41.320 --> 03:47:47.240]  phased in from 2013 to 2018 and they are bragging that
[03:47:47.240 --> 03:47:49.880]  they're going to incrementally do it and that you're going to forget about it
[03:47:49.880 --> 03:47:53.640]  and that your anger is going to dissipate the key is you can't let that
[03:47:53.640 --> 03:47:57.320]  happen you have to make this the establishment's water
[03:47:57.320 --> 03:48:03.240]  loo remember how they promised us nafta and gafta
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:09.720]  nafta and gat the shafta we're going to help us we're going to be great
[03:48:09.720 --> 03:48:13.240]  look at our city's collapsing look at detroit with our 50 unemployment
[03:48:13.240 --> 03:48:17.560]  look at how it's destroyed our nation's industrial base they promised us then
[03:48:17.560 --> 03:48:20.120]  that the service industry would be the savior
[03:48:20.120 --> 03:48:25.080]  that's now contracting the real unemployment is 22 so first they
[03:48:25.080 --> 03:48:29.720]  destroy your industrial base take your jobs and then they bankrupt the states
[03:48:29.720 --> 03:48:33.080]  with more and more unfunded mandates then the people become so poor they've
[03:48:33.080 --> 03:48:37.160]  got to have the free health care they rob whoever else has got a job left
[03:48:37.160 --> 03:48:41.640]  this is about conquering society this is about
[03:48:41.640 --> 03:48:45.160]  domesticating you this is about breaking your will
[03:48:45.160 --> 03:48:48.520]  and they know what they're doing because the banks get their power
[03:48:48.520 --> 03:48:53.000]  when the society goes bankrupt
[03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:57.400]  and once they've got more than half the public
[03:48:57.400 --> 03:49:01.160]  with a government job or on government payroll and some kind of government
[03:49:01.160 --> 03:49:04.200]  check i know they took your money to pay for it
[03:49:04.200 --> 03:49:07.320]  i know a lot of you paid into social security i'm not saying
[03:49:07.320 --> 03:49:11.640]  you don't deserve something the point is they make you dependence and then they
[03:49:11.640 --> 03:49:14.440]  use you and the illegal aliens they've brought in
[03:49:14.440 --> 03:49:18.280]  as a political weapon against the republic and in the end
[03:49:18.280 --> 03:49:21.560]  they're going to take all the chicken feet away from you as they've done in
[03:49:21.560 --> 03:49:24.200]  every other nation
[03:49:25.400 --> 03:49:31.720]  so this is a slow roast that we're witnessing this is incremental
[03:49:31.720 --> 03:49:35.480]  slavery but it is an eye-opener to show the people
[03:49:35.480 --> 03:49:39.320]  that it's unconstitutional it's illegal it's unpopular
[03:49:39.320 --> 03:49:44.120]  but still they did it so the number one thing is to commit yourself
[03:49:44.120 --> 03:49:48.360]  with cold determination to go to city council to go to the state houses
[03:49:48.360 --> 03:49:52.840]  to run for office to support good candidates and to demand your city
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:56.120]  stop having sanctuary cities and and discriminating against
[03:49:56.120 --> 03:49:59.240]  citizens and letting the illegal aliens drunk drive and not have ids
[03:49:59.240 --> 03:50:02.600]  but citizens get the book thrown at them and to make the cities take the floor
[03:50:02.600 --> 03:50:05.800]  out of the water it's a every poll shows the people want that why
[03:50:05.800 --> 03:50:08.920]  doesn't it happen we don't care if you say it's good we know it's poison
[03:50:08.920 --> 03:50:12.120]  we have to get angry and take our government back i don't care if you
[03:50:12.120 --> 03:50:15.960]  start following city council people around as investigative reporters
[03:50:15.960 --> 03:50:19.000]  start your own blog and videotape them with hookers
[03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:23.800]  or taken bribes people in government that are selling their country out
[03:50:23.800 --> 03:50:27.000]  at the at the mid level and high levels are all corrupt
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:31.320]  you start surveilling them you start putting it on youtube
[03:50:31.320 --> 03:50:34.600]  they will fall
[03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:37.480]  all right i'm gonna look over all my notes there's so much i haven't even

[03:54:20.600 --> 03:54:25.960]  cruddy care that now they would just give the money to insurance companies
[03:54:25.960 --> 03:54:28.600]  and that veterans would have to actually buy
[03:54:28.600 --> 03:54:32.280]  their own insurance veterans groups i rate at obama's
[03:54:32.280 --> 03:54:37.160]  private insurance proposal cnn
[03:54:38.360 --> 03:54:43.880]  that is the type of things that these people are doing that's the type of
[03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:47.320]  mindset they have and they know you'll get angry now
[03:54:47.320 --> 03:54:51.240]  but what will you do down the road and then republicans who 30 plus years ago
[03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:54.760]  were against medicare and medicaid which is driven up the price and screwed
[03:54:54.760 --> 03:54:59.400]  everything up now they're for it but see what
[03:54:59.400 --> 03:55:02.360]  this bill really did was cut medicare and medicaid
[03:55:02.360 --> 03:55:05.400]  but then his consent is still went for it so
[03:55:05.400 --> 03:55:08.760]  it's even worse than socialism and that's the important point i keep
[03:55:08.760 --> 03:55:13.240]  hammering home here shelby in texas go ahead you're on the air
[03:55:13.240 --> 03:55:17.640]  well elixir i'm here in austin um it's first time

[03:55:47.320 --> 03:55:51.320]  that's what government becoming your doctor and deciding what care you can
[03:55:51.320 --> 03:55:55.640]  get is all about it's like a t4 program in
[03:55:55.640 --> 03:56:00.680]  germany during world war two um where they killed the uh
[03:56:00.680 --> 03:56:04.520]  the mentally ill and infirm absolutely appreciate your call michael in new

[03:56:19.160 --> 03:56:22.440]  you know sometimes when it rains it pours with these callers you go to them
[03:56:22.440 --> 03:56:25.320]  and they're just not there in other days they don't do that brandon are you
[03:56:25.320 --> 03:56:28.920]  there okay ronnie in texas you're on the air
[03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:32.760]  three's the charm hopefully thank you sir uh the
[03:56:32.760 --> 03:56:35.960]  the first solution here is freedom for family farms
[03:56:35.960 --> 03:56:41.160]  and to cancel the mexican drug war with freedom for uh the constitutional army
[03:56:41.160 --> 03:56:46.040]  of medicinal marijuana enthusiasts from 14 states and many
[03:56:46.040 --> 03:56:53.000]  municipalities that already exist since 1996 14 states
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:56.200]  well ronnie i appreciate your call but what you're saying is part of a bigger
[03:56:56.200 --> 03:57:01.080]  picture with the animal id the premise society the flatulent taxes on uh
[03:57:01.080 --> 03:57:05.000]  cows they want to shut down the family farms that
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:07.800]  is the policy they want you dependent on government
[03:57:07.800 --> 03:57:11.080]  they come into the states and say you can't decriminalize marijuana
[03:57:11.080 --> 03:57:15.720]  or even farm hemp that's better than cotton and has no thc in it
[03:57:15.720 --> 03:57:20.520]  you could smoke a 18 wheeler load and get nothing but a headache
[03:57:20.520 --> 03:57:23.560]  but that shows how the federal government is out of control
[03:57:23.560 --> 03:57:27.960]  but some so-called conservatives even though it's unconstitutional say
[03:57:27.960 --> 03:57:32.360]  yeah we don't want these 14 states decriminalizing marijuana for them
[03:57:32.360 --> 03:57:35.640]  potheds we need to keep the drug war going
[03:57:35.640 --> 03:57:39.320]  well that's unconstitutional so you're going to get obama's health care
[03:57:39.320 --> 03:57:42.360]  you're going to get unconstitutional wars you're going to get the unconstitutional
[03:57:42.360 --> 03:57:45.720]  patriot act and last year law enforcement gave us the
[03:57:45.720 --> 03:57:48.440]  mayak at homeland security documents we broke them
[03:57:48.440 --> 03:57:52.360]  people couldn't believe it was real for a week where homeland security is set up
[03:57:52.360 --> 03:57:57.080]  for we the people and now the irs is your doctor
[03:57:57.080 --> 03:58:00.120]  the irs is going to run your life the irs every two weeks
[03:58:00.120 --> 03:58:03.240]  is going to be looking at your tax ID number and making sure you're paying
[03:58:03.240 --> 03:58:06.360]  that tax money in for insurance and this is only the beginning at five
[03:58:06.360 --> 03:58:09.640]  thousand a year it's going to go up and up and up and up and up
[03:58:09.640 --> 03:58:12.680]  and the quality of the care is going to go down and down and down and down
[03:58:12.680 --> 03:58:15.800]  and these big mega corporations that wrote the bill
[03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:19.000]  and ran the scan that they didn't want the bill in the media
[03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:22.760]  they're going to get more rich and get more power and control
[03:58:22.760 --> 03:58:26.760]  and they don't care of america goes bankrupt they're offshore banks
[03:58:26.760 --> 03:58:31.240]  mexico doesn't care if they go bankrupt as long as carlos slim runs everything
