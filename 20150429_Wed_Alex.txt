[00:00.000 --> 00:13.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.400 --> 00:22.440]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:22.440 --> 00:28.480]  it's simply amazing I've seen personally a pretty big backlash on info wars dot
[00:28.480 --> 00:33.600]  com and on comments on YouTube on my video it was a clip of the live show
[00:33.600 --> 00:38.960]  yesterday just five minutes long where I asked is the word thug the new n word
[00:38.960 --> 00:43.880]  and I showed the history of the thuggy being a thousand-plus-year criminal gang
[00:43.880 --> 00:48.840]  cult from the Middle East all the way into India that murdered an estimated
[00:48.840 --> 00:56.840]  two million people and so any group of organized crime thugs that are kind of
[00:56.840 --> 01:03.480]  low-level and dastardly are called thugs but now a councilman from Baltimore
[01:03.480 --> 01:12.080]  Maryland different people on the the tonight show sports figures you name it
[01:12.080 --> 01:17.480]  are saying it's the new n word to call people attacking firefighters and
[01:17.480 --> 01:22.000]  burning down buildings and chopping fire hoses and when firefighters risk their
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.320]  lives and throwing rocks at citizens and attacking reporters because they're
[01:26.320 --> 01:32.920]  white that if you call them a thug you're racist and the victory all why not
[01:32.920 --> 01:37.720]  why how about I call someone a criminal then I'm racist I mean this is about
[01:37.720 --> 01:43.280]  controlling language and brainwashing the public Steve Watson wrote an article
[01:43.280 --> 01:50.800]  about the little video segment that we had during the radio show yesterday and
[01:50.800 --> 01:54.200]  probably about a third of the people commenting were like I used to like you
[01:54.200 --> 01:59.240]  but you're just a racist and you can see how they're invoking race war in this
[01:59.240 --> 02:04.040]  country and we've now got the National Guard saying this is not martial law
[02:04.040 --> 02:07.880]  when there's a nighttime curfew for everybody and they're attacking
[02:07.880 --> 02:13.240]  reporters and there's troops all over the streets that's called martial law when
[02:13.240 --> 02:17.480]  regular liberties are suspended but of course they don't call it martial law
[02:17.480 --> 02:21.440]  they call it a state of emergency general commanding National Guard in
[02:21.440 --> 02:28.000]  Baltimore this is not martial law so we have got so much news after the break
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.680]  on that front but man political correctness is simply wild you've got
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.000]  Obama calling him thugs you've got all these black leaders calling him thugs
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.680]  but if you call the predominantly black mobs out looting and stuff two wrongs
[02:44.680 --> 02:47.960]  don't make a right even if the cops kill on the guy are in the wrong we don't
[02:47.960 --> 02:56.000]  know what does attacking an RT reporter who's a woman from Russia do what does
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.400]  attacking an Al Jazeera camera crew do or it's just it's ridiculous me attack
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.680]  some Irish guy who you know some some patty who just you know was wandering
[03:07.680 --> 03:14.120]  around I mean this is the type of political correctness gone insane where
[03:14.120 --> 03:20.720]  people can commit all sorts of incredible criminal acts and say it's okay
[03:20.720 --> 03:25.440]  because I'm in a press group there's an attack on language ladies and gentlemen
[03:25.440 --> 03:30.560]  that is insane where you're supposed to take offense from brown bags in Seattle
[03:30.560 --> 03:35.880]  brown bags were never a symbol of racism they just make things racist to
[03:35.880 --> 03:41.960]  control reality like the term patty patty just means St. Patrick's I mean I'm part
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.240]  patty I could say it all I want but who cares notice though Howard Stern and
[03:46.240 --> 03:49.160]  others that are liberal I'm not attacking Howard Stern the point is
[03:49.160 --> 03:53.000]  they're allowed to do anything they want but if someone libertarian or
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.800]  conservative does anything we get crucified this is about bullying and
[03:57.800 --> 04:02.840]  selective control this is what the poverty pimps and the race pimps are
[04:02.840 --> 04:08.320]  pushing period and what Obama and the Justice Department staring this up and
[04:08.320 --> 04:12.200]  playing both sides are doing is diverting from the headline on drugs report.com
[04:12.200 --> 04:19.040]  right now 16% CNS news of Baltimore public school eighth graders proficient in
[04:19.040 --> 04:24.640]  reading school spends 17 thousand plus dollars per student one of the highest
[04:24.640 --> 04:29.400]  averages in the country people always say oh the disadvantaged are being cheated
[04:29.400 --> 04:33.960]  on money really doesn't matter how much money you throw at it if you don't have
[04:33.960 --> 04:40.320]  a family unit you don't have a future I don't care what color you are so this is
[04:40.320 --> 04:45.120]  the great society writ large and now they're the war on the family only
[04:45.120 --> 04:48.920]  intensifies the economy grew at only zero point two percent that's with
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.360]  cook numbers I've talked to a lot of top economists like Dr. Paul Green Roberts
[04:53.360 --> 04:57.240]  and others we actually have a negative growth rate that's called depression when
[04:57.240 --> 05:01.600]  you have it for three quarters. The reporters committee for freedom of the
[05:01.600 --> 05:05.280]  press and eight news media organizations have formed a coalition to
[05:05.280 --> 05:09.080]  demand that a federal court in North Carolina unseal a sentencing memorandum
[05:09.080 --> 05:13.360]  and related letters in the case of David Petraeus. The court document says the
[05:13.360 --> 05:17.640]  public has an especially strong interest in obtaining a full understanding but
[05:17.640 --> 05:22.200]  what did Petraeus leak? Seven black books that contain the classified
[05:22.200 --> 05:26.600]  information regarding the identities of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence
[05:26.600 --> 05:30.840]  capabilities, quotes and deliberative discussions from high-level National
[05:30.840 --> 05:34.280]  Security Council meetings but compare Petraeus' punishment to what John
[05:34.280 --> 05:40.240]  Kiriakou a CIA officer who exposed the CIA's illegal torture program got. The
[05:40.240 --> 05:44.520]  whistleblower got two years in jail for exposing government crime but the
[05:44.520 --> 05:48.280]  general who exposed information that really could have hurt national
[05:48.280 --> 05:53.120]  security got a fine equivalent to 75% of what he gets paid for a single speech
[05:53.120 --> 05:57.600]  and not two years in prison but two years probation. For info wars.com and

[08:41.600 --> 08:44.520]  questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the
[08:44.520 --> 08:47.200]  government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were
[08:47.200 --> 08:52.920]  produced by the government what difference at this point doesn't make
[08:52.920 --> 08:57.920]  when a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community looks
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.440]  beyond fine words and noble phrases there are actions I have the legal

[09:27.120 --> 09:31.640]  are highly effective weapons you just have to be repetitive about this we need
[09:31.640 --> 09:35.560]  to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into
[09:35.560 --> 09:40.400]  thinking about guns in a vastly different way we are trained to deceive if we
[09:40.400 --> 09:44.400]  have to you really don't have to trust me you shouldn't trust me in fact by my
[09:44.400 --> 09:48.720]  actually participating that I will paint the news communities of this kind

[10:31.440 --> 10:37.000]  continuing to only intensify as the global acceleration towards multiple
[10:37.000 --> 10:46.660]  singularities crystallizes BBC headline huge news US economic growth slows to

[11:12.220 --> 11:19.180]  over US military drills jade helm 15 looks more like an exercise in the
[11:19.180 --> 11:24.460]  imposition of martial law said one veteran and Texas Governor Greg Abbott
[11:24.460 --> 11:34.820]  tweeted to his to his credit that they are going to be looking out for the
[11:34.820 --> 11:39.060]  rights of citizens and sovereignty they're gonna have the Texas State Guard
[11:39.060 --> 11:46.540]  and the state police monitoring the feds you can read his full tweet in that
[11:46.540 --> 11:51.980]  article we also wrote an article last night for him for wars.com with his
[11:51.980 --> 11:56.660]  tweet but here it is I've ordered the Texas State Guard to monitor jade helm
[11:56.660 --> 12:01.860]  15 to safeguard Texas constitutional rights private property and civil
[12:01.860 --> 12:06.860]  liberties and I can tell you the Texas State Guard is full of the most hardcore
[12:06.860 --> 12:11.620]  pro-america pro-texas patriots out there it is a wonderful organization I
[12:11.620 --> 12:15.540]  happened to have met the governor when he was Attorney General years ago I
[12:15.540 --> 12:22.060]  happened to know somewhat his chief of staff I happened to know multiple
[12:22.060 --> 12:25.900]  billionaires that know the governor very well and have had dinner with him and
[12:25.900 --> 12:30.580]  who've he stayed at their house and they tell me he knows exactly what's going on
[12:30.580 --> 12:35.740]  in fact I talked about that movie that I was involved in being produced and the
[12:35.740 --> 12:39.940]  whole Chuck Norris constellation and being directed by Chuck Norris's son
[12:39.940 --> 12:45.540]  we're gonna get this particular Texas businessman on and I was filled in on a
[12:45.540 --> 12:49.780]  lot of stuff about the governor there very very exciting when I knew Greg Abbott
[12:49.780 --> 12:53.780]  was good fighting the carbon taxes fighting the open borders as Attorney
[12:53.780 --> 12:59.340]  General he's got scores of lawsuits they're actually having success he's
[12:59.340 --> 13:05.020]  spurring lawsuits against the the the imposition of martial law to open the
[13:05.020 --> 13:10.020]  borders I mean he's just compared to Rick Perry it's night and day Rick Perry
[13:10.020 --> 13:16.620]  compared to Obama night and day Greg Abbott compared to Rick Perry night and
[13:16.620 --> 13:24.300]  day I mean people love gimmicks how about we have a handicapped he's not a
[13:24.300 --> 13:28.980]  quadriplegic he's paralyzed from the chest down what's that paraplegic
[13:28.980 --> 13:33.940]  paraplegic that's right a tree fell on him when he was out jogging once talk
[13:33.940 --> 13:37.260]  about bad luck but I know folks that know him well I don't people that have
[13:37.260 --> 13:40.260]  worked for him before he was even in government I've got a lot of angles on
[13:40.260 --> 13:45.660]  Greg Abbott and he is like super good super good and that's kind of a bad
[13:45.660 --> 13:48.260]  thing to put out there because the establishment obviously knows that
[13:48.260 --> 13:53.020]  there's not any dirt they've got on him and they just absolutely hate his guts
[13:53.020 --> 13:58.180]  they absolutely hate his guts but now the Texas governor the same Attorney
[13:58.180 --> 14:02.420]  General that tried to stop the TSA groping in Texas and then Obama
[14:02.420 --> 14:06.820]  threatened an air blockade you can't make that up is now worried about Jade
[14:06.820 --> 14:13.540]  helm because you got to be the military federally is being directed to train to
[14:13.540 --> 14:17.300]  take on veterans libertarians conservatives and gun owners that's on
[14:17.300 --> 14:23.580]  record I don't care if you get an army Lieutenant Colonel up there to tell us
[14:23.580 --> 14:26.860]  it's not happening we know and of course they're gonna have PR events with
[14:26.860 --> 14:30.380]  legitimate training to make us look discredited that's part of the Psyop
[14:30.380 --> 14:35.260]  people see through it and we're here to make sure you don't condition the
[14:35.260 --> 14:38.900]  public to accept it so I'll be detailing that more we talked to Joe Biggs from
[14:38.900 --> 14:42.420]  Baltimore Maryland here in a moment on this and what they witnessed last night
[14:42.420 --> 14:48.300]  the tear gas the rubber bullets the military disappearing people snatch and
[14:48.300 --> 14:52.940]  grabs that were caught on tape this also happens to G20 our crew witnessed it a
[14:52.940 --> 14:57.860]  few years ago in Pittsburgh so it's a very serious situation that's gonna be
[14:57.860 --> 15:02.580]  coming up also the FBI sent innocent people to their deaths for decades FBI
[15:02.580 --> 15:06.740]  push junk science to condemn the accused very important special report
[15:06.740 --> 15:12.180]  antibiotic resistance combating deadly superbugs weak in most countries
[15:12.180 --> 15:15.980]  World Health Organization report says that soon there could basically be
[15:15.980 --> 15:23.900]  hundreds of drug immune or drug resistant antibiotics that are out there
[15:23.900 --> 15:29.100]  we're going to get into that very important global health threat and the
[15:29.100 --> 15:33.220]  good news that Tyson chicken McDonald's and others are announcing phasing out of
[15:33.220 --> 15:38.260]  antibiotics because they understand that it is causing major auto immunity
[15:38.260 --> 15:42.380]  problems in humans major intestinal problems but more importantly is
[15:42.380 --> 15:48.300]  accelerating the mutation of super bacteria in these diseased petri dishes
[15:48.300 --> 15:58.220]  that are factory farms so that is all coming up today as well also US News and
[15:58.220 --> 16:03.340]  World Report defense bill recognizes Iraq's Kurdish Sunni militias as a
[16:03.340 --> 16:09.100]  country the plan has always been to break Iraq in three parts part of it will
[16:09.100 --> 16:16.580]  be Islamic State run by Saudi Arabia part of it will be basically run by Iran and
[16:16.580 --> 16:21.900]  the other part will be run by the West in and around Baghdad a multinational
[16:21.900 --> 16:27.620]  zone so you now see that plan coming closer to fruition absolute globalist
[16:27.620 --> 16:31.860]  treason they break countries up in the subregions then swallow those in the
[16:31.860 --> 16:35.660]  super regions that's the globalist model Balkanize the nation state
[16:35.660 --> 16:41.340]  shatter it bankrupt it bomb it or economically depress it then move in
[16:41.340 --> 16:47.540]  after that with a larger super region around it then begins taxing the
[16:47.540 --> 16:54.180]  populations Asian Union North American Union and of course the European Union
[16:54.180 --> 17:02.420]  also Russia has now launched wartime government HQ in major military upgrade
[17:02.420 --> 17:07.140]  that's just some of what's coming up today Kim Jong-un has executed 15 top
[17:07.140 --> 17:12.180]  North Korean officials that's being reported the telegraph we're gonna go
[17:12.180 --> 17:16.580]  to break in a moment and come back with Joe Biggs and Jacarie Jackson on the
[17:16.580 --> 17:21.060]  ground in Baltimore, Maryland what they witnessed last night and let me tell you
[17:21.060 --> 17:25.700]  the first clip I want to play is shocking Baltimore Councilman quote loses
[17:25.700 --> 17:34.820]  it says just call them inwards after CNN host calls rioters thugs Obama has
[17:34.820 --> 17:39.620]  called folks thugs the mayor has called them thugs but see this is the same
[17:39.620 --> 17:44.100]  deal black people can say the n-word but they're gonna go further now these
[17:44.100 --> 17:48.020]  these these racepaners these these socialists manipulating black communities
[17:48.020 --> 17:53.660]  these Al Sharpton types now they're going to start saying any other word they

[24:12.460 --> 24:19.540]  we now take you live to our reporter Joe Biggs and Jacare Jackson on the
[24:19.540 --> 24:25.900]  ground in Baltimore Maryland and just breaking on info wars dot com Walmarts
[24:25.900 --> 24:31.820]  in Baltimore are refusing ammo sales we're sending our reporters over there
[24:31.820 --> 24:36.740]  right after they finished talking to us this is important we're gonna get it on
[24:36.740 --> 24:41.500]  video walking right up in them refusing the ammo sales at the Walmart but it's
[24:41.500 --> 24:46.660]  been confirmed huge news that citizens defending themselves the idea of
[24:46.660 --> 24:51.380]  citizens going and buying ammo to protect themselves is inherently evil
[24:51.380 --> 24:57.300]  absolutely wild will break down all the martial law developments but the
[24:57.300 --> 25:00.500]  bottom line is this it's about conditioning the public to see the
[25:00.500 --> 25:04.940]  image of armored vehicles and troops with machine guns on the streets a giant
[25:04.940 --> 25:10.340]  conditioning operation and that's why the mayor ordered to stand down that's
[25:10.340 --> 25:14.660]  why she quote gave him an area to loot she's on the president's counsel one of
[25:14.660 --> 25:19.380]  three mayors she's pushing for federalization this is a false flag
[25:19.380 --> 25:24.980]  attack and now if you call the thugs thugs you're a racist well I called the
[25:24.980 --> 25:29.260]  cops thugs when they attacked the AP reporter I called them thugs when they
[25:29.260 --> 25:34.940]  shot Joe Biggs and tear gas Jacare in Ferguson and I'm calling the people
[25:34.940 --> 25:39.860]  attacking firefighters thugs to I don't like gangs everybody knows it I don't
[25:39.860 --> 25:43.140]  care if it's a white supremacist motorcycle gang I don't care if it's a
[25:43.140 --> 25:47.220]  black gang I don't care if it's Hispanic gang or an Asian gang I hate groups of
[25:47.220 --> 25:51.460]  cowards running around feeding on innocent people and what you've had is
[25:51.460 --> 25:57.420]  criminal gangs in black areas take over and intimidate everybody to adopt their
[25:57.420 --> 26:02.820]  criminal culture and it's destroying the black community it is a criminal thug
[26:02.820 --> 26:08.940]  culture and then stacked up against thug cops it makes them look good I don't
[26:08.940 --> 26:12.580]  mean all the cops are thugs either there's a thug culture taking over the
[26:12.580 --> 26:18.060]  world the globalist are thugs Hitler was a thug Stalin was a thug now say tongue
[26:18.060 --> 26:24.460]  was a thug and they always want the good people's guns excuse me excuse me
[26:24.460 --> 26:27.580]  let's go to Joe Biggs and Jacare Jackson we'll talk to Joe in this segment
[26:27.580 --> 26:30.820]  Jacare in the next great job getting out there last night getting the tear
[26:30.820 --> 26:37.940]  gassing and yeah L rad footage tell us what else you saw Joe Biggs Joe Biggs
[26:37.940 --> 26:41.260]  here with info wars dot com we're in downtown Baltimore at City Hall and as
[26:41.260 --> 26:45.420]  you can see behind me there's an actual guard lined up and down and it's not
[26:45.420 --> 26:49.980]  just here at City Hall Alex it is all of Baltimore there are home these LMTVs
[26:49.980 --> 26:56.740]  FMTVs vehicles trolling up and down the roads home helicopters in the air massive
[26:56.740 --> 27:02.740]  amounts of police at every corner in the entire city at nighttime the nightlife
[27:02.740 --> 27:06.620]  in Baltimore that they usually thrive off of and businesses make money off of
[27:06.620 --> 27:10.820]  this completely dead now because at 10 o'clock even if you own a bar you're not
[27:10.820 --> 27:14.500]  allowed to even have patrons or anything like that people have to be at their
[27:14.500 --> 27:19.660]  home so this is affecting Baltimore tenfold not just the people not just the
[27:19.660 --> 27:23.660]  businesses that were looted but the ones who weren't looted and have to be shut
[27:23.660 --> 27:27.420]  down early because of this we got here last night we got here a little late we
[27:27.420 --> 27:32.780]  got here just about I think it was like eight minutes after the curfew had been
[27:32.780 --> 27:36.780]  in place but they allowed media to go over to where the hotspots were we were
[27:36.780 --> 27:41.380]  at a north of Pennsylvania Avenue when we got there there was probably two three
[27:41.380 --> 27:44.340]  hundred police officers standing in the middle of the road they had started off
[27:44.340 --> 27:48.180]  small in the middle and then started pushing out around all the roads to push
[27:48.180 --> 27:51.780]  people further and further back there were a few times that some people were
[27:51.780 --> 27:56.660]  shot out with the pepper balls rubber bullets and the pepper balls kind of
[27:56.660 --> 28:02.220]  give off that smoke pepper spray kind of smell as well so it wasn't as bad that
[28:02.220 --> 28:06.860]  definitely worked but as you can see I mean it's a complete total police state
[28:06.860 --> 28:10.500]  out here now I mean like I said you cannot go around a corner without seeing
[28:10.500 --> 28:14.720]  a Humvee without seeing soldiers posted up with M4s you know this isn't a training
[28:14.720 --> 28:18.020]  exercise they don't have blank adapters on the front of their guns they don't
[28:18.020 --> 28:22.320]  have missing magazines in the well there are magazines in there they're fully
[28:22.320 --> 28:25.860]  armored they've got their gas mask on this is what's happening here in Baltimore
[28:25.860 --> 28:29.460]  and for folks that don't know under every definition when you've got military
[28:29.460 --> 28:33.300]  locked and loaded when you've got armored vehicles when you've got a nighttime
[28:33.300 --> 28:38.260]  curfew for adults and children when you've got the situation it's called
[28:38.260 --> 28:43.140]  martial law when you were in Baghdad when you were in Iraq which was under a
[28:43.140 --> 28:47.260]  type of martial law obviously were restaurants and bars allowed to be open
[28:47.260 --> 28:52.100]  after 10 oh well they don't have bars or anything like that but I mean some
[28:52.100 --> 28:54.980]  people just didn't care I mean those people that's their home they're not
[28:54.980 --> 28:58.180]  really gonna you know listen to what they're saying by the way that's a good
[28:58.180 --> 29:03.060]  point there were bars until Saddam was removed were restaurants and hotels and
[29:03.060 --> 29:10.060]  things open after 10 at night yeah so you're saying there was less freedom
[29:10.060 --> 29:15.300]  after 10 in Baltimore than when you were in Iraq oh yeah definitely I mean it
[29:15.300 --> 29:18.740]  was a ghost town like we were I felt like I was in that movie vanilla sky and
[29:18.740 --> 29:22.020]  it was just me and jacari were the only two people alive on the planet because
[29:22.020 --> 29:24.860]  we were just driving up and down the road there was nothing going on there was
[29:24.860 --> 29:29.060]  nothing everyone's blinds were closed no open signs in any bar that would
[29:29.060 --> 29:33.460]  normally be open as of like a week ago everything is completely shut down in
[29:33.460 --> 29:37.940]  this town today there's a little bit of a mostly media out here some people are
[29:37.940 --> 29:42.580]  going back to their normal jobs but still there's a lot of big info wars.com
[29:42.580 --> 29:47.140]  report up stay there I want to get a shot closer to the troops up against the
[29:47.140 --> 29:50.940]  fence when we come back and talk to you and jacari we're on the march the

[30:14.940 --> 30:21.420]  category as exposure to lead chloroform gasoline and the pesticide DDT a recent
[30:21.420 --> 30:25.500]  scientific report titled wide children absorb more microwave radiation than
[30:25.500 --> 30:30.380]  adults argued that children in fetuses absorb more microwave radiation because
[30:30.380 --> 30:34.460]  their bodies are relatively smaller their skulls are thinner and their brain
[30:34.460 --> 30:38.260]  tissue is more absorbent another study published by the British Medical
[30:38.260 --> 30:42.940]  Journal determined that exposure to cell phone towers alters brain function in

[34:40.460 --> 34:46.500]  the industry knows who he is but the general public doesn't kind of like the
[34:46.500 --> 34:51.420]  Marshall plan people don't know who Marshall is the Pentagon he's the future
[34:51.420 --> 34:56.860]  has been there running things for about 50 years so similar parallel David
[34:56.860 --> 35:00.580]  Breckler it's just bizarre we can even get him here in studio with us so I'm
[35:00.580 --> 35:07.580]  very very excited with that coming up something else before we go back to Joe
[35:07.580 --> 35:12.580]  Biggs and Jacarie Jackson there in Baltimore Maryland I didn't start the
[35:12.580 --> 35:18.660]  Alex Jones show on YouTube that has over 500 million views
[35:18.660 --> 35:26.740]  a fellow named Dave Thomas who now works with us from his family farm in Oregon
[35:26.740 --> 35:34.140]  did total we have about a billion views on allied and affiliated channels but
[35:34.140 --> 35:43.780]  it's the big one with over half a billion views and it is now two thousand five
[35:43.780 --> 35:52.020]  hundred and sixty two away subscribers from one million subscribers and that's
[35:52.020 --> 35:55.300]  a big deal because we've got a lot of censorship a lot of manipulation a lot
[35:55.300 --> 35:59.420]  of dirty tricks as everyone knows through different corporations and groups
[35:59.420 --> 36:03.540]  manipulating YouTube and we know that most people who are subscribers don't
[36:03.540 --> 36:07.100]  even get sent our videos if you don't get the videos every day you need to
[36:07.100 --> 36:12.140]  request them and make a stink with YouTube because the fact that we do have
[36:12.140 --> 36:15.940]  a million subscribers is a big deal in fact who will be our millionth
[36:15.940 --> 36:21.740]  subscriber I want to get another two thousand five hundred and sixty two
[36:21.740 --> 36:25.780]  subscribers today but every really tried to get subscribers about a month ago I
[36:25.780 --> 36:31.180]  said you know we're about thirty thousand away from a million why don't we put an
[36:31.180 --> 36:38.900]  annotation on the videos saying follow info wars on YouTube get our videos
[36:38.900 --> 36:43.860]  first be the millions subscriber and so we got a lot more subscribers a lot
[36:43.860 --> 36:50.540]  faster doing that so two thousand five hundred and sixty two away from one
[36:50.540 --> 36:55.820]  million subscribers on that channel a fat billion that's a very conservative
[36:55.820 --> 37:01.940]  number of fat billion views on YouTube our one channel five hundred million
[37:01.940 --> 37:06.820]  nine hundred eighty four thousand views and YouTube did something where Sony got
[37:06.820 --> 37:10.380]  caught gaming views three years ago along with others so they dialed back
[37:10.380 --> 37:15.100]  every channel by about a third because of profit sharing I didn't even have it
[37:15.100 --> 37:19.020]  monetized then and they dial back everybody's views about a third so
[37:19.020 --> 37:25.780]  really it's 700 million views to be conservative probably 750 million that
[37:25.780 --> 37:29.500]  was in the news when they did that oh well we've got some big corporations
[37:29.500 --> 37:34.020]  record companies gaming the views to get money you know just like the White
[37:34.020 --> 37:38.700]  House 97% of Michelle Obama and Obama's Twitter followers are fake I can go out
[37:38.700 --> 37:45.260]  for $10,000 and buy a million Twitter followers and even though marketing wise
[37:45.260 --> 37:51.260]  that's junk accounts some of my real people they just called them I won't do
[37:51.260 --> 37:54.500]  it even though we could use that to reach those people it just seems weird
[37:54.500 --> 37:59.380]  maybe I should buy Twitter followers I just have never done it we haven't bought
[37:59.380 --> 38:05.100]  Facebook followers either we've got about three million between our 14 or so
[38:05.100 --> 38:09.220]  channels so that's exciting news I'm gonna break down everything that's
[38:09.220 --> 38:13.500]  happened in Baltimore what it really means in my view where it's all going
[38:13.500 --> 38:17.620]  obviously things have de-escalated since they put more troops and police on the
[38:17.620 --> 38:24.020]  street than looters and thugs and idiots who burn down their own businesses it's
[38:24.020 --> 38:26.700]  just like in Ferguson burning down black churches and black businesses because
[38:26.700 --> 38:31.740]  they're mad that they have a business you know 18 16 year old thugs attacking
[38:31.740 --> 38:35.740]  firefighters throwing mall off cocktails at them and there's video we have video
[38:35.740 --> 38:41.180]  and put it up of people hacking fire hoses as firefighters try to put out
[38:41.180 --> 38:47.660]  black apartment blocks if people die in that you've now committed murder idiot
[38:47.660 --> 38:55.660]  oh but I'm sorry I called you a thug you know how about attempted murderer how
[38:55.660 --> 38:58.980]  about attempted murderer oh but I may have a city council member call me a
[38:58.980 --> 39:04.540]  racist I'm so scared don't call me that you're the moral authority oh my gosh my
[39:04.540 --> 39:08.380]  ego is so small that if you call me that I'm gonna I'm gonna curl up in a ball and
[39:08.380 --> 39:13.940]  cry I'm so sick of it wave your magic wand call me racist all you want if I
[39:13.940 --> 39:18.340]  see a thug cop beating up some lady for no reason I'm gonna call him a thug I
[39:18.340 --> 39:22.580]  see a thug black guy beating up some white teenager I'm gonna call him a
[39:22.580 --> 39:26.380]  racist thug I see the clan beating up some black people I'm gonna call them
[39:26.380 --> 39:30.660]  racist thugs I always have but I don't need to sit here and explain myself to
[39:30.660 --> 39:35.700]  you who sit there and make excuses for your lives blaming people like me you're
[39:35.700 --> 39:42.580]  the racist idiots that city council member can go right to Hades as far as
[39:42.580 --> 39:49.780]  I'm concerned excuse me let's go back to Joe Biggs in what he's called what I've
[39:49.780 --> 39:54.300]  called martial law but the commanding general says it's not martial law Joe
[39:54.300 --> 40:01.540]  but right behind you I see locked and loaded M4s I see armored Humvees I see
[40:01.540 --> 40:05.740]  curfews Joe Biggs reporting from Baltimore Maryland well the interesting
[40:05.740 --> 40:09.980]  thing is Jalex we are back here in front of City Hall in Baltimore the
[40:09.980 --> 40:13.060]  interesting thing is oh these are creative events just like in Ferguson
[40:13.060 --> 40:17.900]  this is a mirrored image of what happened in Ferguson you get this police
[40:17.900 --> 40:20.580]  say you get people in the mines that where they're like you know what we need
[40:20.580 --> 40:24.460]  the National Guard here we need this many police here we need five seven
[40:24.460 --> 40:28.460]  thousand people out here telling us when to go to bed and then when the
[40:28.460 --> 40:32.380]  violence stops eventually the curfew is still gonna remain and these troops
[40:32.380 --> 40:35.300]  aren't gonna leave at some point in time and it's all a conditioning thing and
[40:35.300 --> 40:38.300]  that's what people are understanding as we walk up and down the street you hear
[40:38.300 --> 40:41.060]  people saying like oh my god thank god they're here and they're running around
[40:41.060 --> 40:44.820]  they're taking pictures they all think it's cool and it just seems like they're
[40:44.820 --> 40:49.580]  being brainwashed to think this is how it should be to have five six seven
[40:49.580 --> 40:53.420]  helicopters flying overhead to have Humvees at every corner you know and
[40:53.420 --> 40:56.820]  then you know last night I ran into Rachel Maddow I mean my bad Chris Hayes
[40:56.820 --> 41:03.420]  from MSNBC I get that this too much what is she saying I mean I couldn't hear
[41:03.420 --> 41:05.700]  what they were saying but I mean I'm sure it had something to do with you know
[41:05.700 --> 41:10.620]  veterans or the reason that these riots are started or that the white people it's
[41:10.620 --> 41:13.580]  all you know white people's fault everything like that you know whatever
[41:13.580 --> 41:15.820]  it's the same thing that they always well we do we didn't know what they were
[41:15.820 --> 41:21.300]  saying we have CNN and MSNBC blaming white people and veterans I didn't see
[41:21.300 --> 41:26.060]  any veterans riding or looting Joe but yeah we have the photo on screen of you
[41:26.060 --> 41:31.140]  and Rachel Maddow but it is just in or Mr. Maddow it is incredible though that
[41:31.140 --> 41:35.420]  they would try to bring veterans into this yeah yesterday it was a reporter
[41:35.420 --> 41:39.100]  from CNN and she said that you know these veterans go over to combat and they
[41:39.100 --> 41:42.020]  see all this war and they come back and they just want to fight they just want
[41:42.020 --> 41:45.780]  to they want to go to battle and I'm like how do you bring veterans into this
[41:45.780 --> 41:50.700]  I mean it's completely baseless and pointless it's just ridiculous you know
[41:50.700 --> 41:54.620]  this is a town that's gonna suffer for a while because just like in Ferguson
[41:54.620 --> 41:58.260]  who's gonna want to go back and rebuild in those areas where that happened no
[41:58.260 --> 42:01.900]  one is it's gonna create a vacuum and the violence will get worse in those
[42:01.900 --> 42:07.580]  areas due to that just like we went in caused the problems in Iraq we pulled
[42:07.580 --> 42:11.140]  everyone out and then created this vacuum and now you have ISIS in there so
[42:11.140 --> 42:15.100]  it's ridiculous they go and they create these issues and then they let it get
[42:15.100 --> 42:18.220]  worse and then they go oh my god we need more police when these militarized
[42:18.220 --> 42:22.420]  police are one of the main reasons that this stuff is happening I want to go
[42:22.420 --> 42:25.420]  back to you and get more of your breakdown and excellent reporting then
[42:25.420 --> 42:29.260]  talk to Chikari in a moment as well Joe Biggs but first off here's the
[42:29.260 --> 42:35.700]  reporter Baldwin on CNN last night what we just talked about we talked about
[42:35.700 --> 42:39.140]  training we talk about having officers I was talking to city councilman here
[42:39.140 --> 42:41.540]  last week who was saying Brooke these people have to live in the communities
[42:41.540 --> 42:45.380]  there's no one vote emotional or there's a lack of emotional investment and a
[42:45.380 --> 42:47.980]  lot of these young people I mean I've been talking about this so much a lot
[42:47.980 --> 42:51.020]  of these young people and I love our nation's veterans but some of them are
[42:51.020 --> 42:54.980]  coming back from war they don't know the communities and they're ready to do
[42:54.980 --> 43:01.380]  battle you know here's the deal the police are out of control in many areas
[43:01.380 --> 43:05.780]  the feds have trained them to act like this but to scapegoat the average cop or
[43:05.780 --> 43:10.660]  the average veteran is literally a load of bull but you notice it's the Southern
[43:10.660 --> 43:15.340]  Poverty Law Center Obama script who's the number one enemy Joe the veterans
[43:15.340 --> 43:21.800]  so you bring them into it yeah it just adds to the whole narrative they're
[43:21.800 --> 43:24.220]  trying to push down everyone's face like oh my god he just got back from my
[43:24.220 --> 43:27.980]  accurate Afghanistan that means you're a bad person you're evil you can you can
[43:27.980 --> 43:31.780]  set up ID's oh my god you know like 90% of these people don't even know how to
[43:31.780 --> 43:34.900]  do half of that stuff most of the people who are even in the military played
[43:34.900 --> 43:39.340]  solitaire probably 80% of their time in duty and only shot a gun during some
[43:39.340 --> 43:45.300]  kind of right it's only special forces obviously Navy Seals Green Berets that
[43:45.300 --> 43:48.540]  know how to do that and that's to improvise behind enemy lines what would
[43:48.540 --> 43:54.500]  you say 3% of the army knows how to build ID's yeah I mean you have your
[43:54.500 --> 43:58.260]  explosive ordnance disposal units and then you have your specialized units as
[43:58.260 --> 44:02.460]  well like your special forces I mean that's it I mean my way of doing it when
[44:02.460 --> 44:05.620]  I was over in Iraq if I didn't feel like waiting on an EOD team for five hours
[44:05.620 --> 44:09.460]  was to get on top of a tank and shoot a 50 calat until exploded you know that's
[44:09.460 --> 44:13.420]  not the proper way to do it but you know we got impatient we wanted to move we
[44:13.420 --> 44:16.420]  didn't want to get ambushed but I do have something important to point out
[44:16.420 --> 44:21.300]  something that Jakari and I noticed as we were driving past the Baltimore Raven
[44:21.300 --> 44:26.020]  Stadium there are paratroopers here for some reason Alex there are soldiers out
[44:26.020 --> 44:29.820]  here with the red or the maroon beret I had when I was at a yeah they're
[44:29.820 --> 44:33.100]  airborne troops but that's I think that's kind of odd scene in South there's
[44:33.100 --> 44:37.140]  mostly National Guard but you have a airborne unit over here towards so we
[44:37.140 --> 44:44.220]  have big army there yes now would that be under north com or south com well I'm
[44:44.220 --> 44:49.580]  sure that probably north but under Jade Helm we've got south com let me segue
[44:49.580 --> 44:52.700]  for a moment and then get more of your breakdown I want to talk to Jakari
[44:52.700 --> 44:57.740]  Jackson who's there what do you make of the governor did you see the Texas
[44:57.740 --> 45:01.620]  governor come out and say that he's basically concerned because citizens are
[45:01.620 --> 45:05.540]  concerned he said I've ordered the Texas State Guard to monitor Jade Helm 15 to
[45:05.540 --> 45:09.060]  safeguard Texas constitutional rights private property and civil liberties
[45:09.060 --> 45:13.580]  that's a pretty positive statement oh exactly I think Governor Greg Abbott is
[45:13.580 --> 45:17.660]  an amazing human being from what I've seen that's why I was really excited to
[45:17.660 --> 45:23.300]  be able to go to the the governor's race when he was there for that I think he's
[45:23.300 --> 45:27.500]  a great leader and I think he's gonna do some good stuff he heard concern he saw
[45:27.500 --> 45:31.180]  that there was a way that he could possibly monitor it and help ease the
[45:31.180 --> 45:34.700]  people of Texas their fears and I think he's doing the right thing by having them
[45:34.700 --> 45:38.180]  go out there and help monitor to make sure that our liberties are protected and
[45:38.180 --> 45:41.420]  that you don't run amok I'm really worried about Governor Abbott because I
[45:41.420 --> 45:45.500]  happen to know from so many different people including folks some people that
[45:45.500 --> 45:48.380]  work here that have actually worked for him I didn't know that separately done
[45:48.380 --> 45:52.580]  work for him that he is just a really good Christian man he knows what's going
[45:52.580 --> 45:55.940]  on I happen to know and they'll use this at the White House make a big deal out
[45:55.940 --> 46:00.300]  of it that he monitors this show for years I interviewed him over a decade
[46:00.300 --> 46:04.220]  ago when he was in just another area of state government I happen to know that
[46:04.220 --> 46:09.420]  he really understands what's happening and he's being further educated by some
[46:09.420 --> 46:15.100]  high-level people and that's got to freak the system out Joe Biggs yeah
[46:15.100 --> 46:18.300]  exactly like I said I mean he seems like someone who's on it he's someone who's
[46:18.300 --> 46:23.020]  dedicated to securing our borders in Texas he's dedicated to making sure that
[46:23.020 --> 46:27.380]  people of Texas are you know they're their minds are ease that they know
[46:27.380 --> 46:31.100]  that they can feel comfortable with a man like him up there doing something
[46:31.100 --> 46:34.540]  because he's done so much important big things throughout his life I really
[46:34.540 --> 46:37.580]  think it's a good thing for Texas and I can tell that the people can see that
[46:37.580 --> 46:43.500]  absolutely I mean Rick Perry was a fake a Democrat an anti-guider Gardasil
[46:43.500 --> 46:49.380]  pusher compared to Obama he was good but I mean Greg Abbott is is is is is
[46:49.380 --> 46:54.300]  Ron Paul level I mean I'm telling folks right now that you better pray for him
[46:54.300 --> 46:58.620]  because he's just amazing and he's suing Obama I think like 20 different
[46:58.620 --> 47:03.060]  lawsuits a couple of them are winning and now Obama's appealing I mean it's
[47:03.060 --> 47:07.540]  Greg Abbott more than anybody that is opposing the globalist takeover at a
[47:07.540 --> 47:11.940]  state level yeah exactly he came out here and he hit the the pavement hard he
[47:11.940 --> 47:16.020]  is he's moving with this thing at full speed and that's what I that's what's
[47:16.020 --> 47:20.900]  really motivating to me absolutely I want to get jacarys take on the
[47:20.900 --> 47:24.140]  situation you guys can reverse roles but any other points you'd like to add I
[47:24.140 --> 47:27.700]  want you to go over to Walmart and have them refuse to sell you ammo we have it
[47:27.700 --> 47:31.620]  confirmed but it's pretty big news and I also tell me what else you're gonna be
[47:31.620 --> 47:39.100]  investigating Joe Biggs well yeah later on we're gonna we continue to monitor the
[47:39.100 --> 47:42.420]  at Baltimore police Twitter account that's where they put up all their up-to-date
[47:42.420 --> 47:45.340]  stuff where there's protests going on so we're gonna monitor that throughout the
[47:45.340 --> 47:49.420]  day and try to follow any leads we can with that another thing is oh is it you
[47:49.420 --> 47:52.300]  know at the end of the day we'll go back to the main hot spot which is north of
[47:52.300 --> 47:55.860]  Pennsylvania tonight which is where all the police were last night as well so
[47:55.860 --> 47:58.860]  we're gonna be monitoring this stuff and just like I heard earlier that we're
[47:58.860 --> 48:02.540]  almost close to a million subscribers so I hope that people get out there share
[48:02.540 --> 48:06.340]  the YouTube channel and just get excited about and watch our reports and share
[48:06.340 --> 48:12.660]  them absolutely Joe I see three National Guardsmen behind you and he's
[48:12.660 --> 48:16.100]  look a little more seasoned than some of the other ones I've seen in New York and
[48:16.100 --> 48:20.220]  DC before they're just out there to condition the public can you walk over
[48:20.220 --> 48:23.100]  to the fence and just try to talk to them see if they'll talk to us can
[48:23.100 --> 48:26.140]  jacari follow you briefly

[49:17.300 --> 49:23.700]  force whatsoever asking what's in his gun asking who's loaded with live ammo
[49:23.700 --> 49:29.660]  no he's not I can tell no he's asking if you were loaded I don't see a magazine
[49:29.660 --> 49:35.900]  you will so you know we're able to defend ourselves are you able to detain
[49:35.900 --> 49:45.660]  we're able to defend our standard rules of escalation but can you can you guys
[49:45.660 --> 49:54.100]  actually detain people at all you do have the authority to detain people all
[49:54.100 --> 50:10.460]  right so they said they have the authority to detain people but what
[50:10.460 --> 50:14.180]  they're trying to do is avoid that so far they said and leave that up to the
[50:14.180 --> 50:19.780]  extra 5,000 police officers they brought into the town we have footage of this
[50:19.780 --> 50:23.460]  snatch and grab last night I know you've seen that what do you make of a Humvee
[50:23.460 --> 50:26.620]  driving up and grabbing a peaceful demonstrator and dragging him away that
[50:26.620 --> 50:31.620]  is that that's third-world thug right there those military grabbing him and
[50:31.620 --> 50:36.660]  disappearing him and rough handling him as thuggist behavior yeah we saw a good
[50:36.660 --> 50:41.220]  bit of that that second time that a jacari and I were in Ferguson they would
[50:41.220 --> 50:46.220]  come in run out and grab someone they're not quite as organized this time
[50:46.220 --> 50:50.180]  around but I'm sure over the next course of days the way I see it right now
[50:50.180 --> 50:55.020]  Alex is is when the initial riots happened back in November and it got
[50:55.020 --> 50:59.180]  crazy or no back in August and things got crazy and then what do they do they
[50:59.180 --> 51:02.500]  brought in the state troopers they brought in captain Johnson and the
[51:02.500 --> 51:05.580]  following day like yesterday there were parades in the streets everyone was
[51:05.580 --> 51:10.660]  dancing there were thousands of people out there beating drums happy just doing
[51:10.660 --> 51:16.380]  everything but then the next day which would be today it just went to hell all
[51:16.380 --> 51:20.940]  over again if they show too much force and attack people that'll be deliberately
[51:20.940 --> 51:26.300]  to escalate things I don't think the grassroots military knows that but we
[51:26.300 --> 51:29.380]  seem us over and over again and we have the mayor caught red-handed saying they
[51:29.380 --> 51:33.300]  let them loot and riot to get all this started I mean this is clearly a false
[51:33.300 --> 51:40.380]  flag in my view job oh yeah exactly I mean without a doubt all right I'm gonna
[51:40.380 --> 51:45.420]  play a minute and a half piece a promo piece a trailer for the extensive
[51:45.420 --> 51:50.860]  interview with William Benny the former director of technical at the NSA that's
[51:50.860 --> 51:55.780]  gonna exclusively air here Thursday a mini documentary Thursday so while we're
[51:55.780 --> 51:59.580]  getting jacari in front of the camera with the troops in the background we're
[51:59.580 --> 52:05.460]  gonna play this piece and premiere it here on the radio TV right now remember
[52:05.460 --> 52:10.860]  if you are a radio listener and you hear me say look at this look at that I
[52:10.860 --> 52:18.420]  started 15 years ago simulcasting radio with TV I started doing it full time
[52:18.420 --> 52:23.580]  10 years ago because people would say no there are no UN signs at the Grand
[52:23.580 --> 52:28.140]  Canyon or no that bill doesn't exist or no you don't have footage of this they
[52:28.140 --> 52:32.820]  would just say I was a liar so we pioneered I'm proud of it taking radio
[52:32.820 --> 52:38.220]  and turning it into TV now radio I like to show better is radio because I know
[52:38.220 --> 52:41.420]  I'm telling the truth I can just sit back and listen to it while I'm driving my
[52:41.420 --> 52:46.460]  car or whatever but as added documentation we have now an eight-camera

[56:32.420 --> 56:35.380]  go to this piece on William Benny who's already gone in and blown up a major
[56:35.380 --> 56:41.020]  death star exposing me in I say here it is the whole point is that under a
[56:41.020 --> 56:45.860]  surveillance state you have very few liberties unless they if they don't want
[56:45.860 --> 56:48.980]  you to have certain do certain things then they have ways and means of getting
[56:48.980 --> 56:53.060]  you like they did with us they came busting in one of them came running up
[56:53.060 --> 56:59.620]  and was pointed a gun at my eyeballs and pulled me out of the shower you know if
[56:59.620 --> 57:02.900]  you've nothing if you're nothing to hide you have nothing to fear well that's a
[57:02.900 --> 57:07.220]  great quote from Joseph gerbils first of all and secondly it's totally irrelevant
[57:07.220 --> 57:11.140]  what do you think what you think is totally irrelevant it means absolutely
[57:11.140 --> 57:14.700]  nothing the government only considers its view of you and if you're doing
[57:14.700 --> 57:17.500]  something they don't like they will come after you no matter what you think of
[57:17.500 --> 57:24.100]  it you had the will to march into Congress and to tell them what was going
[57:24.100 --> 57:28.740]  on the first guy I mean that's 10 times bigger than Snowden internally and to
[57:28.740 --> 57:32.380]  really start this whole internal debate in this avalanche of understanding now
[57:32.380 --> 57:36.420]  I mean you were really one of the first people to ring the bell to warn folks
[57:36.420 --> 57:40.900]  that that the country as we knew it was being dismantled why else would they
[57:40.900 --> 57:44.540]  keep all these things secret do things in secret with a secret court keeping
[57:44.540 --> 57:49.380]  their interpretation secret I put it down to three factors power money and
[57:49.380 --> 57:54.460]  control if they had deployed it we would have we would have been my view there
[57:54.460 --> 57:58.900]  would be no way we wouldn't have stopped 9-11 the biggest threat I see anyway it's
[57:58.900 --> 58:03.540]  the federal government and how they're operating in secrecy and basically
[58:03.540 --> 58:08.340]  creating a secret government so I basically call it the greatest threat
[58:08.340 --> 58:12.380]  to our democracy and republic since the Civil War are you confident that you
[58:12.380 --> 58:15.860]  know everything that's going on within that agency and that you can say to the

[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.980]  joe bigs what a great team they make from Ferguson and so many other events
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:57.540]  brave fellas last night was more subdued than night before but so a lot of
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:01.260]  looting and burning and it follows the same pattern they will escalate and
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:07.220]  attack people tonight to try to get a big event going to sell more martial law
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:13.500]  as the mayor said that you know they wanted to give folks an area to loot and
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.140]  in fact in case people don't believe us we're going to play that clip right now
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:19.660]  and then go to jacardi jackson and get his take on this hopefully though the
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.780]  public is puts enough pressure on the feds who are running this puppet
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:27.780]  government in baltimore to not escalate the situation let's go ahead and go to
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:35.300]  that clip of the mayor we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:43.140]  that as well and we work very hard to to keep that balance and and to put
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:46.700]  ourselves in the best position to de-escalate and that's what you saw
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:50.620]  all right let's go to jacardi jackson in the video feed you're ready a listener
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:54.140]  info wars dot com board slash show please spread that link to everyone you
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:59.460]  know jacardi your take now being in the middle of martial law 2015
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:03.940]  jacardi jackson reporting live from baltimore maryland yes alex i saw that
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:07.700]  clip that you just played the mayor i didn't think that was a good strategy at
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.420]  all it's one thing to say that we put them in an area so we could close in and
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:15.740]  try to stop the violence but just to have a area for them to run around wild
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.220]  and did not seem to help the situation at all last night we had a chance to go
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:23.180]  out to the main scene where you guys saw the footage the previous days very
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.900]  strong police presence out there also national guard it was everything from
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:30.780]  the local police to the county sheriff to the state troopers and also the
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:34.700]  national guard as far as what we personally witnessed i didn't see any
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:39.100]  snatching grabs i didn't see any uh... writing or looting going on i know
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:43.140]  there's videos of other things going on in other areas we did see a few of the
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:47.700]  officers operate somewhat capillarily with the uh... the rubber bullets that
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.740]  they had one officer this is the video that we put out last night he shot
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:55.300]  multiple rounds uh... say that that we can see the building was blocking and
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:58.660]  there's another guy who's riding around on his bicycle i don't think he was
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:01.220]  threatening the police is more pestering them and they shot him in the
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.780]  butt with a rubber bullet so it's stuff like that going on
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:08.420]  uh... heavy police presence also uh... plenty of vehicles i don't know
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.500]  i guess we've probably seen uh...
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:14.220]  hundreds of people around town of various vehicles everything from
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.620]  smaller humvees to police cruisers m-wraps uh...
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:21.620]  whatever they're called all types of vehicles all around town and even
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.660]  right now
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.380]  if you go around to use certain areas of the city where they fired out the tear
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:29.340]  gas last night you can still get a bit of a lingering effect that that the wind
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.820]  blows hard enough so the people here are definitely been affected by this of
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:36.100]  most people who have been walking by right now are you know i have a very
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:38.380]  friendly attitude towards the national guardsmen
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:40.660]  uh... they're taking selfies and all that kind of stuff
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:43.580]  and yes there was a discreasing violence last night
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.340]  and i definitely think that police presence help with that but then again
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.020]  you know how long is this going to last you know is it going to last a day is
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.620]  going to last a week you know how long they
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.460]  plan to keep this up before things go back to normal
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.020]  people can realize they can have a normal community
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.700]  if they just get these uh...
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.820]  get people off the streets
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.900]  who are causing these problems the police chief came out yesterday and uh...
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.300]  press conference i saw
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.820]  they said we had more parents
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.580]  like the mom who was running around smacking
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.460]  sensitive to her son you know these things wouldn't happen as much and we
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:13.500]  can have a more peaceful society
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.740]  well said jacar i want to come back and speak to you a little bit more about
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:19.620]  what you think is going to happen tonight your predictions
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:24.420]  and where you think all this is going and and what type of society are we now
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.780]  where the police obviously with their killer training are are are out of
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.220]  control in some areas
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.380]  but then these events are taken by the media
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.820]  and escalated
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:36.580]  to our now around the clock not even in the summer
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.860]  uh... we have civil unrest in america that's clearly being fomented
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.340]  what do you think the end game is jacar jackson we return
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.180]  i'm alex jones info wars dot com
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.140]  forward slash show
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.220]  everybody should sit down on twitter facebook youtube tell your friends and
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:51.860]  family
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.940]  that's where everybody can watch the free video feed and find the free
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:56.380]  podcast droid
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.860]  and iphone apps
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.140]  that's how we win the info war
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:04.220]  as the city of balsamore struggles to deal with violence and eluding
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.220]  i'm reminded of something the mayor recently said
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.500]  it's a very delicate balancing act
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.460]  because while we tried to make sure they were protected from the cars and other
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.020]  things that were going on
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:18.940]  we also gave those who wish to destroy space to do that as well
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:23.540]  mayor rollins blake said in part in other words a stand-down order
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:27.700]  and i'm very much against using things like tear gas on peaceful demonstrators
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:32.740]  but to allow people to destroy part of the city is something else entirely
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.700]  the answer to the situations is not to federalize the police as the justice
[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.260]  department suggests
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.380]  because remember the mraps and other armaments these departments get
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.820]  they get from the pentagon
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:48.700]  which is to say if federalized police take over you're not going to see less
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.860]  of these armaments you're going to see more

[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:33.060]  maryland i don't just want to talk about this subject this hour i want to get
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:39.380]  into a host of issues like this one this is such a big deal u.s. economic growth
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:46.060]  slows to zero point two percent let's get something straight i'm not a profit of
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:55.820]  doom i'm someone who understands that facing trends facing problems debating
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:02.260]  them is what saves civilizations when civilizations start living in denial to
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:08.900]  use the allegory of superman nobody gets off the planet when it blows up well we
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:12.540]  don't have the ability to get off this planet right now as steven hawking just
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:16.660]  said we're not going to make it if we don't so we need to not have world war
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:23.260]  three not release bio weapons and not create nano tech that kills everybody not
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:28.020]  do experiments that they admit could cause a chain reaction a strangelet or a
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.580]  black hole or a singularity event a quantum event that could damage or
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:38.380]  destroy the planet some estimates are of a black hole gets purchased and is able
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:42.700]  to actually gain mass it would not just destroy the earth with what they're
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:48.260]  doing in hadron but would probably suck in the sun and the entire solar system
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:56.580]  off of that mass it would then begin to travel around the galaxy having snacks
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:09.500]  that's not science fiction max plank the german physicist in 1900 developed the
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:18.900]  quantum mechanics equations that were later turned in to atomic bombs the
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:27.660]  atomic bomb is 115 years old what do you think they have now
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:33.540]  NASA believes they've developed a warp drive why do you think all these things
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:42.380]  that you continue to see in the news were in Star Trek 40 years ago 50 years
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:48.980]  ago because Jack Parsons who headed up the space propulsion laboratory was an
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:53.700]  admitted satanist just even on HBO a few weeks ago in a documentary I couldn't
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:59.380]  believe they admitted it and he hung out with the author of Star Trek you just
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:04.420]  can't make this stuff up and that's why you see Star Trek it's the UN symbol and
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:11.900]  everything I mean it's all predictive programming so these are the real issues
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:17.900]  that affect our species and we need to have a debate about this in fact I was
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:23.860]  gonna wait till the bottom of the hour I'm gonna start doing more uplifting
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:30.180]  positive pieces we already do this but I want to make a focus on self-help a
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:34.900]  focus on empowering the human spirit a focus on believing in humanity do we
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:41.620]  have that video ready I don't even know what to call this clip I'd kind of come
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:46.060]  up with a headline earlier but this is the secret to transcending the New
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:53.580]  World Order it is the secret to humanity surviving the simple ideas I lay
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:12:05.300]  out transcend the globalist paradigm this is the secret it really is to
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:09.860]  controlling your own destiny controlling your own destiny starts when you
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:15.060]  begin to realize you can begin in increments to change your destiny and
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:19.860]  the destiny of the world around you I have changed the destiny of tens of
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:24.980]  millions of people you have changed it by supporting me by magnifying what we
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:31.660]  say and what we do and what we cover and then adding intel you have incredible
[01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:36.220]  power who knows who will cause the spark to move us either towards destruction
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:43.140]  or away from it but it isn't about getting the credit for it it's about
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:47.860]  seeing the world you've changed I take incredible pleasure watching mainstream
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:51.940]  news or listening to mainstream talk radio and hearing them repeat exactly
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:59.740]  what I said 10 years ago using terms I coined I I I just reveled in tuning in
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:04.820]  to almost every major libertarian conservative show even shows that attack
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:12.900]  me and realizing that they have copied the cut of my jib that is intense
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:19.500]  pleasure not in that it's empowering me and my ego but that I really cheer on
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:24.420]  team humanity I really want us to survive I know the power of humanity of
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:33.620]  humankind and I want to bring that idea back that's always been the idea of any
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:38.460]  civilization that rises is beauty and honor and diligence and creativity
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:42.540]  there's always a struggle between destructiveness and wickedness and a
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:51.740]  oppression and rape and repine versus our greater angels so if you want to
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:59.700]  change the world look in the mirror like V from Vendetta says I know why you did
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:08.700]  it you were scared who wouldn't be ISIS al Qaeda the Bola the flu collapsing
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:17.740]  wages open borders race war and in your fear you turn to the central government
[01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:22.460]  who is directing the crises themselves to bring you order but in in exchange for
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:30.180]  order you were given tyranny and oppression and lack of freedom and a
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:35.460]  media that seeks to topple common sense and attack the family and every form of
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:43.020]  individual freedom oh there are those who are more responsible and they will be
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:50.180]  held accountable but in the end you only need to look in the mirror let's go
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:58.260]  ahead and go to this piece again put together by Josh Owen have you ever
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:02.340]  just paused for a moment turned off the television and put away people magazine
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:06.300]  to look around you and realize where we are on this beautiful planet hurtling
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:10.740]  through space orbiting the Sun out on the edge of a spiral arm of Milky Way
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:17.580]  Galaxy because that simple thought that simple moment of pulling back and getting
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:23.940]  outside the box of coming out of the cave in the wider world has helped me and
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:29.060]  many others realize how pathetic the global social engineers really are who
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:34.500]  would attempt to shutter the psyches the minds the creativity of the people
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:39.380]  even more I look at the messages put out by Hollywood mainstream media about how
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:44.460]  ugly we are about how dumb we are about how bad we are how we're a disease on
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:49.340]  the face of the world now we've got to be exterminated that's a bunch of greedy
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:57.740]  hateful control freaks who are envious of beautiful and smart people who wish to
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:04.860]  set themselves up as gods in some type of high-tech nightmare world I'm here as
[01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:10.660]  a 21st century Paul Revere telling you I believe in you but beyond believing in
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:17.780]  you at a cellular level I know how powerful you are when you realize the
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:24.620]  true destiny of humanity and when you understand that you are the heirs of all
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:31.740]  the humans that came before us that did incredible things to bring us to this
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:37.580]  point they say necessity is the mother of invention we have the necessity to
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:41.260]  defeat the new world order the globalist the eugenicist the social
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:47.020]  engineers that are waging war on our people whether you are old young and
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:51.500]  no matter what color your skin is we are all brothers and sisters in this human
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:56.500]  quest going back tens of thousands of years I don't want us to fail now
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:01.500]  because a small group of predators learned how we worked and then launched a
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:06.140]  war against their own species so they could greedily control the entire future
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:13.820]  destiny I want the compendium the great mass of humanity with our ideas and with
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:20.220]  our competition and with our loves and passions to decide the future in an open
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:26.700]  free society not one based on lies not one based on fraud but based on love of
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:32.460]  humanity and free will you have the power you are incredible creatures you
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:39.740]  are the heirs of this amazing genetic treasure trove of struggle let's not
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:44.740]  just let humanity survive let's build on what we've already done and make our
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:48.980]  ancestors proud because they are watching today they are inside of us
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:54.500]  every cell every genetic memory we are all those that came before us and we will
[01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:59.660]  live forever through our progeny into the future but make no mistake there's an
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:04.820]  epic war an incredible battle over the future of our species happening right
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:09.180]  now you don't want to sit on the sidelines you don't want to sit in the
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:17.940]  middle of the road you want to choose sides and I have a quote by
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:28.660]  astronaut Edgar Mitchell from the moon commenting on his meditation from another
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:34.420]  heavenly body you develop an instant global consciousness a people orientation
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:38.740]  an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world and a compulsion to do
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:44.300]  something about it from out there on the moon international politics looks so
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:49.140]  petty you want to grab a politician by the scrap of the neck and drag him a
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:57.340]  quarter of a million miles out and say look at that you son of a bitch look at
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:05.340]  that that's why I get so angry when I watch known social engineers who want
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:12.180]  race-based politics and racism posing as if they're the good guys the judges the
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:17.500]  arbitrators our bosses telling us we're racist if we use the word thug for
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:23.180]  looters or telling us we're anti-government terrorist if we criticize
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:27.860]  Obamacare and then to watch people rolling over and fear lest they be called
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:33.060]  to name it's a badge of honor to be attacked by the Benedict Arnold media
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:39.500]  it's a badge of honor to be under attack by these people they took the easy way to
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:44.220]  prey on humanity to cheat humanity to keep a man to keep humanity in the dark
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:51.980]  they're the enemy of all that's good they are vampires they are predators and
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:56.380]  they will destroy our future if they're not dealt with we'll be back with our
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:02.820]  reporters a ton of news and more by now you know that wireless technology like

[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:17.700]  historical projection I'd call it immersing myself in their writings their
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:25.420]  literature their culture so long that I now understand how they think and it
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:35.300]  sends shutters I just got chills from the tip of my toes right back through to my

[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.820]  lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words are for the
[01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:30.580]  means to meaning and for those who will listen the annunciation of truth there
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:35.020]  is something terribly wrong with this country isn't that you decided sir you
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:38.900]  wanted it for proof you told me every television in London cruelty and injustice
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:43.300]  intolerance and oppression and where once you had the freedom to object and
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:47.980]  think and speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:52.420]  perversing your conformity and so getting your submachine cameras how did
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:56.740]  this happen who's to blame well certainly there are those who are more
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:02.020]  responsible than others they will be held accountable but again truth be told if
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:08.100]  you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror I know why you
[01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:14.820]  did it I know you were afraid who would be war terror disease there were a
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:19.860]  myriad of problems inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common
[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:24.660]  sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn to the now high
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:30.260]  chancellor Adam Sutler he promised you order he promised you peace and all he
[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:35.180]  demanded in return was your silent to obedient consent
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:46.220]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:53.340]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war and
[01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:58.300]  William Benny is another person just like V from Vendetta with the true
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:03.220]  courage the whole point is that under a surveillance state you have very few
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:07.940]  liberties unless they if they don't want you to have certain do certain things
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.380]  and they have ways and means of getting to you like they did with us they came
[01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:17.620]  busting in one of them came running up and was pointed a gun at my eyeballs and
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:21.460]  pulled me out of the shower you know if you've nothing if you're nothing to
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:24.820]  hide you have nothing to fear well that's a great poke from Joseph Gerbils
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:29.140]  first of all and secondly it's totally irrelevant what you think what you think
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.740]  is totally relevant it means absolutely nothing the government only
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:36.180]  considers its view of you and if you're doing something they don't like they
[01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:42.300]  will come after you no matter what you think of it you had the will to march
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:46.580]  into Congress and to tell them what was going on the first guy I mean that's
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:50.320]  ten times bigger than Snowden internally and to really start this whole
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.100]  internal debate in this avalanche of understanding now I mean you were really
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:58.820]  one of the first people to ring the bell to warn folks that that the country as
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:02.540]  we knew it was being dismantled why else would they keep all these things secret
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:06.580]  do things in secret with a secret court keeping their interpretation secret I
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:12.020]  put it down to three factors power money and control if they had deployed it we
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.140]  would have we would have been my view there would be no way we wouldn't have
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:20.980]  stopped 9-11 the biggest threat I see anyway is is the federal government how
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:26.900]  they're operating in secrecy and basically creating a secret government so
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:30.540]  I basically call it the greatest threat to our democracy and republic since the
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:34.740]  Civil War are you confident that you know everything that's going on within
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:41.620]  that agency you can say to the American people it's all done the right way yes
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:46.900]  coming to the info war this Thursday the many documentary I haven't even
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:51.980]  decided that on the name of it yet but it's with William Benny in extensive
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:56.740]  interviews we did in studio and also driving around a car downtown a very
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:02.820]  powerful what's coming up and certainly needs to get out to the public you know
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:06.420]  I couldn't say that I know everything going on or even a lot of what's going
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:10.860]  on in my own office if I did there are some offices run like that nothing gets
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:14.500]  done you just try to hire people that then prove themselves you can trust to
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:21.780]  carry out a mission you really can't have slavery in a successful company it's
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:26.700]  liberty-based you've got a lead you've got a people that want to be part of the
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:30.820]  mission that's well known in leadership but under the modern corporate model
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:34.260]  it's all about domination and robotic control that's why they're going to
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:40.180]  robots that's how you enslave people is cutting out the organic system that
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:46.220]  humans control and run and forcing that artificiality and that's not me saying
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:51.380]  that that's the establishment sure I saw it 20 years ago and warns you but now
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:58.740]  it's so far along it's it's in the news every day the smart meters tracking you
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:02.500]  and taxing you and controlling your thermostat and the driverless cars oh
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:05.980]  yeah they're gonna be driverless in a couple years and driving will be banned
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:09.580]  by humans first we're gonna tax you more if you try to drive them we'll just ban
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.660]  you oh you know what the new cars are coming out they're already quasi
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.980]  driverless they'll slam on the brakes if a car slams on you don't see it they'll
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:22.060]  report back what you're doing to police see they're just doing it they don't
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:26.740]  announce it they just do it and we go and fair it out what's in the internal
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:30.780]  documents what's in the trade publications years before decades before
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:35.460]  it's ubiquitous we go hey your scientific Atlantic cable box has a
[01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:40.660]  microphone a camera in 1998 watching and listening to you here let me bust it
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:49.100]  open on TV and show you the blueprints and show you the microphone and I got
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.540]  death threats that very night and then had stalkers going after my sister
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:56.620]  within two days and people calling me saying we're gonna cut your head off if
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:01.020]  you don't shut up cuz see back then people were like what there's a
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:06.500]  microphone a camera they were getting upset now these look yeah there's a
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:10.460]  microphone camera I use it to interface with it yeah and they admit they're
[01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:14.860]  listening and watching you and telling you the terms of conditions of all the
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:18.740]  new major smart TV manufacturers that they are watching and listening and
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:25.860]  shelling what happens in your house what you say and do to third parties bigger
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:41.900]  than Dallas bigger than Dolly Parton in yo face so frustrating I mean I've said
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:46.940]  this a thousand times I'll say it again I'm just a regular organic person normal
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:52.700]  Americana values normal survival instinct watching total evil takeover I
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:56.260]  mean if the elite were watching and listening to us I would say down the
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:00.540]  road it could be dangerous they could abuse it if they weren't putting cancer
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:08.700]  viruses in the vaccines and hydrofluorosalistic electrified fluoride
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:15.820]  acid psychotropic acid not not not acid in the 60s acid but a
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:23.100]  psychotropic adjuvant acid to accelerate the other stuff they're adding to the
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:27.060]  water you know expensive it would be for them to put enough synthetic Prozac in
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:32.180]  to really control the population unless you add fluoride the same molecule they
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:35.780]  add the fluoride to supercharge the other drugs they're adding and and you
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:41.820]  know this is a real blind spot we have we're so close to this that when the
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:45.140]  government finally comes out and says we're cutting fluoride by half it's
[01:40:45.140 --> 01:40:48.540]  causing brain damage and bone cancer and your teeth the fracture blah blah blah
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:55.500]  no one even talks about it I was telling a friend yesterday yeah the
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:00.420]  government admits fluorides causing cancer and they just cut it in they just
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:04.500]  cut it in water by half and I knew the person would read it on their phone in
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:08.140]  front of me and then go with the spin that was there that oh well that was just
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:10.460]  because it causes dental fluorescence that's what they went with in the news
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:16.820]  not what the actual report says and I just know exactly how people respond it's
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:27.620]  sickening it's sickening it's disgusting it's an absolute fact the
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:32.300]  White House science are wrote a book in the 70s and in it they admit
[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:35.340]  fluoridation is there to reduce your fertility and make you docile and
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:43.100]  stupid it's called eco science it's in my office it's free online that's not
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:45.620]  true they tried to block scribs a few months ago and Ted had taken down
[01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:51.980]  everybody just reposted it some book out of print taxpayer paid for 1100 pages
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:57.260]  long and they don't want that little goblin that little knuckle dragon night
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:13.300]  crawling thug piece of trash snake John P. Holdren and he wrote that book he
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.860]  wrote that book
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:23.580]  Paul Ehrlich and his wife they even bill themselves the savers of the earth you
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:26.820]  know Hitler said he wanted to exterminate most of the global population to save the
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:32.620]  earth Plato said that two thousand four hundred years ago
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:38.580]  see if you're Jeffrey Dahmer and just kill 15 people you're a ghoul a monster a
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:48.420]  demon but if you kill tens of millions for the earth you're a saint and they
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:53.380]  all advocate this and they're high and mighty and they know what to do and well
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:56.980]  yes we've got to manage the public and if we don't dumb them down there they'll
[01:42:56.980 --> 01:43:03.020]  question too much and that's why they try to hard cops now with under 100 IQs
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:07.300]  to see we're just the tail end of humanity we're being phased out the
[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:11.020]  rise of the machines is here the decision has been made well let me give you a
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:18.300]  little newsflash gum I've made the decision and billions of other people
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:21.580]  are in the process of making the decision hundreds of millions already have
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.220]  the chain reaction is already lit you know it you admit it in all your
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:29.740]  congressional and UN hearings you're all running around scared to death so now
[01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:32.540]  you've gone from denying everything to going yeah we got Swiss bank accounts
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:38.820]  the Socialist Party in France don't pay taxes so what yeah you know what we
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.740]  really do put that stuff in your water big deal yeah you know what we really
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:46.540]  are set up a world government now you hope you can just hide in plain view
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:51.380]  that's not gonna fly either as your plan unfolds people are gonna know it was
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:56.260]  you and so you're stoking racial and religious and ethnic and regional
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:44:01.020]  differences all over the world as part of the great game of sectarian
[01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:08.180]  manipulation desperately and that's only gonna work so long and we the people
[01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:13.220]  every race color creed worldwide are now understanding your operation and
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:17.500]  we're now exposing it and we've reached critical mass we've reached event
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:26.260]  horizon you can feel the enemy burning under the heat now on the scale of the
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:30.980]  next 10 to 20 years when this fight will be decided in my view to a great
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:39.700]  extent people are going to think the globalist are winning folks are going
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:44.740]  to think that they're unstoppable that they're invincible and it will appear
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:49.300]  that they're winning on many fronts but their desperate move will actually
[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:56.980]  force humanity to resist in ways that are new and inventive and in the final
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:45:04.220]  equation the tyranny will fall there's a spark in humanity that dreams of
[01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:09.100]  freedom and as it gets more and more oppressive more and more wicked more and
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:12.940]  more dominating no amount of drugs no amount of entertainment no amount of
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:18.340]  nihilism for the elite and their minions will quench their thirst and as they
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:27.300]  begin like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus to be struck with reality and
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:31.740]  when they feel the incredible empowerment of joining with life and
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:37.940]  justice and truth like a chain reaction we will see a revival of the human
[01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:43.380]  spirit not a revival of these glitter bugs CIA recruited in Texas and other
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:49.220]  states in the 1970s revival con men preachers to go out and discredit
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:56.340]  Christianity but a true revival a Christ-based revival within the human
[01:45:56.340 --> 01:46:07.100]  soul written on the spirit that will instantly transcend Satan's paradigm we
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:12.860]  are entering the most fabulous time in human existence but we first have to go
[01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:19.180]  through this squall this storm and we're now entering that storm the metal is now
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:28.260]  being put into the furnace the great testing is now to begin the age-old
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:36.460]  foretold time of massive accelerated change is upon us may you live an
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:43.540]  interesting times to quote the double-edged Chinese parable you live I
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:54.700]  live we live in interesting times choose wisely because in this universe
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:47:01.940]  everything comes in threes you were born and you live and you have a life on a
[01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:07.500]  consciousness you are a manifestation of the genetics and the struggles and the
[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:16.540]  compressed instincts and memories of all those that came before you and the
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:21.660]  genetic re-tweaking of the mitochondrial DNA when a new male is
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:28.700]  created and new data from the female is transmitted forward in an attempt to make
[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:37.260]  the species survive males are just combat model females the geneticists all
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:40.380]  know this isn't all the top literature that's why that's the joke of men and
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:44.740]  women fighting with each other it's completely ridiculous I mean it's
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:50.700]  crazy ladies and gentlemen and by manifesting into the future you are
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:55.940]  living now the genetics that came before you were living and then above that
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:48:03.020]  there is a spirit that interfaces with that and in this earth suit that we have
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:06.860]  and the enemy knows that they understand them they're trying to hack it
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:10.820]  they're trying to block it they're trying to control it because they won't
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:15.940]  be in control if humanity is in control the elite see themselves as a new
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:20.420]  species and I haven't even gotten into the news completely yet I apologize but
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:26.180]  I'm just really focusing in on getting past all the minutiae and thinking
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:35.180]  about the big picture as I said earlier there is no doubt we are the people that
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:38.700]  came before us they've proven the epigenetics they've proven you've got
[01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:42.820]  the compressed memories of your ancestors and everything they do is to block
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:47.140]  those and now the top scientists are looking into the DNA and how the DNA
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:55.060]  resonates like a receiver and is being interfaced with by the universe itself
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:49:03.780]  where antennas dialed into the space winds how fabulous and fantastic is that
[01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:12.260]  and you could feel them once you open yourself up to it once you dial in it's
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:20.020]  beyond anything you could even imagine but the enemy has dialed into something
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:27.660]  else the enemy has dialed into something very dark and not of this dimension you
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:32.620]  can definitely tell that you can sense it you can see it and that my friends is
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:35.260]  the rest of the story I'm gonna come back with the economy and the Russia

[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:24.700]  well Hillary Clinton's now come out the articles on info wars.com by Curt
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:32.060]  Emma and blamed the race riots and that's what they are on income inequity not on
[01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:37.020]  the drug war that Clinton brought into high gear not on Obama who's under his
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:41.180]  policies and globalist policies doubled black unemployment the highest level
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:46.420]  ever it's doubled in seven years but don't worry white people did it well
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:49.740]  actually a bunch of white people running mega banks I guess kind of did but
[01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:52.860]  let's just get them to blame you know an RT camera person or something that
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:58.860]  nothing to do with it simply amazing simply amazing to see that and that
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:02.580]  brings me to my next story that I mentioned earlier this is a big deal
[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:07.820]  because if you go to John Williams shadow stats or you go to just different
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:12.260]  analysts we've had on Hunter Paul Craig Roberts they cook unemployment they
[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:17.620]  cook inflation they they cook it all they they cook growth a couple points when
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:22.740]  it comes to growth at least so two three points negative growth and the growth
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:26.980]  we've got is selective through government contracts and corporate
[01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:33.660]  welfare and remember we've had QE unlimited QE infinity up until now and
[01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:38.700]  they're still involved in quantitative easing so even with trillions of
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:41.820]  dollars being given to select banks remember we don't get it we don't get
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:46.820]  low interest rates it payday loans or you know car loans it's like six seven
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:50.820]  eight nine ten some credit cards are thirty forty percent you don't get that
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:56.540]  they get the free credit which is free money so when you hear zero point two
[01:55:56.540 --> 01:56:01.700]  that is the sound of a needle going across a record I mean that is or two
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:07.060]  cars smashing into each other the US economy grew at an annual rate of just
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:12.300]  zero point two and three months to end of March official figure show the growth
[01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:16.980]  figure was far lower than expectations analysts had forecast growth would be
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:22.900]  about one percent I mean one percent doesn't even fit for inflation I mean
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:27.180]  they're claiming inflation's like six percent that's folks inflation's like
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:30.700]  ten percent according to all the top economists they use the old ways of
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:36.740]  calculating it they blame harsh winter weather for a second year you mean cold
[01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:42.340]  winter weather of it global warming's real pay some taxes on carbon dioxide
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:48.340]  that'll fix it while they build any matter bombs and release nanotech and GMO
[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:52.540]  in the air I mean God knows that our planet is in an emergency situation and
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:55.580]  they've got us worried about carbon dioxide I mean it just shows how crazy
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:59.300]  the elite are I mean it's like they're worse than the villains from Hellraiser
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:04.940]  I mean they are just they are just a pack of demons they've almost sold
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:11.940]  America on torturing people's kids in front of them to get answers I mean it's
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:18.140]  just this guy's the limit like I said they teach three-year-olds now I just
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:22.660]  can't even say it on air and it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier and
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:28.340]  crazier I had Dr. Frederick Whitehurst on 18 years ago when I had him on about
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:31.940]  five six years ago and then about a year ago I want to get him back on the FBI
[01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:35.940]  sent innocent people to their deaths for decades special report on info wars
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:39.500]  calm and it just goes into the mainstream admissions now that almost
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:44.420]  everybody was framed they would just basically set people up or just not
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:49.020]  care and just certify whatever and every other major crime lab from Dallas to
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:53.420]  Houston to I'm just mentioning to my state Seattle you name it's been caught
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:58.780]  framing people oh but the forensic shows show how they're getting the bad guys
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:04.500]  oh yeah and there are some good people in these forensic labs they'll get
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:07.500]  pressured to frame people that's why we keep learning about it so here is the
[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:13.260]  good news there are a ton of people in these crime labs that actually do their
[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:17.060]  jobs and do actually bust people but it takes time it takes energy and they
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:21.940]  won't frame folks but then they'll come in and say we need a conviction or we
[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:25.820]  need that we don't need a conviction DA wants to drop this what we've got their
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:31.660]  blood it's them we got his fingerprints another case well we can't prove it well
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:36.980]  he's got armed robbers so let's just say you did it you see how that works I mean
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:41.300]  you can't trust anything the system does folks the feds have a 97% conviction

[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:29.900]  Austin Texas Alex Jones our reporters are on the ground in Baltimore Maryland
[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:34.260]  will have more coverage live tonight but also going over to the Walmart's where
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:37.820]  they're refusing to sell ammo to people to protect themselves we've also got a
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:42.660]  collection of Twitter photos and images and videos from the streets of
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:47.020]  Baltimore the images that the media doesn't want you to see pictures and
[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:51.580]  footage you won't see on TV Baltimore citizens are done with mindless rioters
[02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:57.900]  and of all races colors and creeds they're coming together and that is the
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:03.460]  last thing the White House wants they want absolute balkanization but then
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:09.100]  they can also then grandstand and act like that they're trying to deescalate
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:15.340]  the situation as well but a lot of powerful photos and videos up there on
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:19.500]  the site other good news GMOs getting pulled at more and more major
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:24.620]  institutions will cover that the next segment the bad news is our economy is
[02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:29.620]  being purposely consolidated vertically integrated collapsed because they know
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:33.980]  you're voting with your euros and your dollars and your yen and your yon and
[02:01:33.980 --> 02:01:43.660]  your shekels and your rubles to have more choice to have higher quality big
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:49.980]  globalist institutions from McDonald's to Coca-Cola are in trouble when you get
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:54.220]  internal memos from Bilderberg as we have it's all about controlled integrated
[02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:59.420]  economies to basically get the general public on welfare so they're
[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:03.100]  dependent and then you only have folks that work for corporations and soon the
[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:06.380]  military won't even have jobs because it's going to be robots and drones and
[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:10.420]  autonomous computers that run it with central war planners that program the
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:19.260]  attack profiles so again major tectonic geopolitical sociological cultural
[02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:26.060]  mass shifts going on everywhere why the future doesn't need us because the
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:30.980]  establishment doesn't want us and things were ugly and stupid and they sit up
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:34.900]  there in their ivory towers built on the ashes and the bones and the hard work
[02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:39.620]  of the people and then think they don't need the public as if the elites are
[02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:44.980]  going to build a system not meant for 90% of the world as if they won't end up
[02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:52.740]  being chewed up by this technocratic terror that they're building so to quote
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:58.380]  Darth Vader don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:05.820]  you dig a pit you end up falling into it yourself like I've got it here in my
[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:10.340]  stack that Tyson's gonna phase out antibiotics McDonald's is getting rid
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:14.860]  of it but really they're just saying the type humans take but at least it's a
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:18.380]  step in the right direction so that it won't create mutations and bugs that
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:22.620]  supposedly affect humans but variants of the same antibiotics will still cause a
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:26.380]  same problem at least on the surface though they're trying to act like
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:30.580]  they're changing to lure you back in to eat their food chipotle and others are
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:34.660]  announcing it the drier's ice cream bluebell I mean there's announcements
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:37.820]  every few days now thousands of companies I mean you go to the store now
[02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:41.140]  even mainline stores and it's we're organic we don't have high fructose
[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:45.540]  corn syrup you know we've got vitamins infused but is it organic is it
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:51.740]  non-synthetic we have David Breckler joining us who if you're not a
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:55.460]  nutraceutical in Saturday you probably don't even know who he is but he is the
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:04:00.100]  vitamin man I'm dubbing him that he didn't do that himself he's gonna be in
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:03.460]  studio whether it's talking about some really positive things that are happening
[02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:09.420]  guys can you print me the ABC or London Guardian from yesterday about them we're
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:13.580]  saying take the floor out of the water as well the government I mean a huge
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:18.460]  victory but we're still getting called Cooke saying it's bad for you no the
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:24.140]  truth is we're winning humanity's winning and if we fight for ideas and
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:27.980]  fight for liberty and fight for choice and don't fight over race or whether
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:32.500]  you're a cop or you're not a cop and stop hating each other like the central
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:39.380]  systems want we can have a new Renaissance because the darker it gets
[02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:43.900]  the more bright that light is and you are one of those lights people say what
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:47.420]  is that George Herbert Walker Bush Illuminati thousand points of light they
[02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:51.660]  always take everything that's already true and it's God's creation and they
[02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:57.820]  create a counterfeit but we are billions of points of light
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:04.660]  CNN captured live footage of a peaceful but well-known activist being abducted
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:09.220]  in Baltimore yet they failed to point it out or report on it there was outrage
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:13.220]  on Twitter that CNN wouldn't report on what their own camera had shot the
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:17.660]  activists Joseph Kent told Baltimore City paper last November everyone knows
[02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:21.620]  me already for making sure everything is running peacefully a local pastor
[02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:25.700]  described him as Martin Luther King with tattoos and gold fronts the clip
[02:05:25.700 --> 02:05:29.660]  shows Joseph Kent in front of a line of cops and national guard troops before
[02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:33.300]  Humvee slowly drives toward him the guard troops rush out from the line grab
[02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:37.100]  Kent and the vehicle is used to block the news cameras from seeing anything else
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:40.980]  Kent was likely arrested for violating the 10 p.m. curfew although there were
[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:45.540]  hundreds of others who did the same and were not arrested was Kent abducted
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:49.940]  simply because he's a prominent activist and organizer this would not be the
[02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:54.060]  first time that's happened see the clip and the full story at info wars.com

[02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:05.660]  hi I'm Alex Jones when I got on air 20 years ago I weighed 180 pounds I lift
[02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:10.020]  weights five days a week I could swim two three miles then I discovered the
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:13.580]  new world order the globalist their agenda I started an access television
[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:18.140]  show I was so dedicated to my work and hanging around with radio guys that I
[02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:24.380]  began drinking I began smoking cigars and then even cigarettes I transformed from
[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:29.660]  looking like a white Bruce Lee to looking like a job of the hut so I began a
[02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:35.060]  journey five years ago to shed the almost 100 pounds I started taking
[02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:40.420]  super male vitality and saw dramatic results in just a few weeks when I added

[02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:30.180]  the infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones well we've got David Breckler for the
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:33.740]  balance of the hour in studio with us he's a nutraceutical industry expert
[02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:37.660]  she one of the biggest companies out there and consultant to multi-billion
[02:08:37.660 --> 02:08:41.900]  dollar supplement companies who's worked with top manufacturers and stores over
[02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:45.680]  the past 20 years including Whole Foods, Vitacosts, Sprouts, Swanson Health,
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:49.940]  Vitamin Shop and many others now David uses his expertise in the field to help
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:53.660]  formulate the most high-quality nutraceuticals for the infowarslife
[02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:57.540]  brand as well we're very excited about him helping us out with at least four of
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:09:01.300]  our products 20 years in the nutraceutical industry as a consultant
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:05.540]  to billion-dollar supplement companies works with top manufacturers and stores
[02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:10.380]  including Whole Foods natural approach versus big pharma drugs the difference
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:14.940]  and we went to him when we wanted to continue to expand our line and have the
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:18.180]  cleanest the best effect I told him when I knew you could come to town two weeks
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:21.180]  ago I think we probably forgot didn't do it but some of the tests are up on
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:26.500]  infowars.com and infowarslife.com we send them off to all the big you know
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:30.420]  testers even though you guys test it we've been sending your products and
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:34.460]  some of the others off and they go we never see this it's even below California
[02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:39.060]  standards there's nothing no contaminants which is supposedly impossible
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:44.740]  because there's you know parts per billion of anything in the air so we've
[02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:48.260]  been seeing some bizarre results and I told Anthony weeks ago we should do a
[02:09:48.260 --> 02:09:52.380]  whole report showing those we're gonna do that soon because they're like
[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:55.820]  thinking it's the twilight zone now at this point but some of our products have
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:10:01.060]  like 15 ingredients and there's nothing in there these spectrometers or whatever
[02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:06.260]  can find nothing bad I mean that is unprecedented and this is not an
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:10.660]  infomercial for infowarslife.com even though we fund ourselves I'll probably
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:14.620]  plug it two or three minutes this hour I wanted to actually do something other
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:19.580]  talk show hosts don't do actually bring you industry experts in here like David
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:24.260]  Breckler who I would call the vitamin man or mr. nutraceutical you've got the
[02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:28.420]  food babe and stuff like that at the health ranger that we've got mr. vitamin
[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:32.460]  here with us we're gonna talk about the difference between true and junk
[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:35.940]  supplements fake vitamins quality control mainstream medicines failure to
[02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:40.300]  address the root issues with toxic medicines how mainstream medicine was
[02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:44.300]  made popular original health conspiracy natural approach versus big pharma
[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:48.980]  drugs how to identify if you're being sold junk we use one of the top herbal
[02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:53.780]  identifiers in the world and so David Breckler thank you so much for joining
[02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:57.460]  us all right Alex it's an honor to be here long time listening to have you and
[02:10:57.460 --> 02:11:02.180]  we're also gonna get into this US lowers fluoride levels and drinking water for
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:06.540]  first time in 50 years showing problems with cancer brain damage teeth
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:11.380]  fracturing fluorosis everything the alternative health groups and vitamin
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:15.140]  groups have been saying the ones that care a lot of them just you know put out
[02:11:15.140 --> 02:11:17.900]  crap and aren't politically involved because the government come after you
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:22.060]  but you've been politically involved we salute you how big a victory is this
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:29.100]  how big a victory is Tyson McDonald's Chipotle all the last three weeks saying
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:32.060]  we're gonna get rid of the human antibiotics we're gonna get rid of the
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:38.060]  human you know bovine growth hormone synthetic I mean every day we're seeing
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:41.540]  victories that years ago would have been off the chart to the point if I almost
[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:45.740]  didn't even say anything yesterday oh look they admit fluoride's killing you
[02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:50.260]  they're cutting it by half this is a devastating victory and it's because
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:56.340]  their own scientists almost to a person have been raising hell excuse me I'm
[02:11:56.340 --> 02:11:59.780]  ranting it's so good to have you here all right thanks a lot Alex and
[02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:04.420]  congratulations the fluoride victory has a lot to do with this program really it
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:09.420]  does you're spreading the message more than than anybody and you know we really
[02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:12.940]  believe that health freedom and political freedom go hand-in-hand and
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:16.980]  this situation this this issue is a great example of it here's a situation
[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:20.740]  where the political side of it can actually start to positively affect
[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:24.460]  people's health and the fluoride in the water is is one of the most dangerous
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:28.500]  things going on right now it's absolutely criminal well the reason I get so
[02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:34.060]  excited is every time humanity fights we turn things around but how but 95% of
[02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:38.260]  people aren't getting involved because they think they've got to fix it all
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:41.460]  themselves no you've just got to change the way you live I mean I'm still not
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:45.820]  that healthy but I've lost 60 something pounds I look a lot better and in a
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:49.940]  couple years or I'll be back to what I was when I was 20 yeah I mean it's a
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:54.540]  process yeah absolutely you know affluent and smart people are not drinking tap
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:58.700]  water they're just not they're drinking good high-quality bottled water but we
[02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:01.780]  need that for everybody everybody should get it and I would say that the next
[02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:05.300]  victory is to get the fluoride out of the water completely that'll be the next
[02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:12.340]  step as a major CEO how big a deal is it this happening huge huge because like
[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:16.300]  you've been saying for years they've never medicated a whole society through
[02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:20.620]  the drinking water and they can't control the dosing and the equipment that
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:25.940]  actually puts the fluoride in the water breaks and has failures all the time so
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:28.900]  even though they're lowering the amount of fluoride they're still having
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:32.380]  catastrophic failures well sure well the hydrofluorosalic acid as you know gets
[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:36.540]  supercharged into an acid it's not calcium fluoride that you need a little
[02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:40.460]  bit of and it's like alien blood from alien it literally eats through
[02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:45.020]  multi floors one drop exactly that's why the equipment is just that's why it's
[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:49.540]  breaking it corrodes the equipment that they use to inject it into the water
[02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:54.580]  they wear spaces to mess with it to handle it no it's unbelievable they're
[02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:59.060]  putting that in the water it really is but here it is oh my gosh they're cutting
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:02.420]  half of it out the water they've banned it to be used as a pesticide there's a
[02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:05.820]  bio accumulates I mean that is a victory yeah you know what are the crux of the
[02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:09.220]  issues with the fluoride too is that you know there's never been one double
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:13.540]  blind controlled study that actually proves that ingesting fluoride lowers
[02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:20.180]  dental cavities and they use the research that comes from the topical use of
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:24.740]  fluoride to substantiate the oral ingestation of it so one day I called
[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:29.300]  the ADA to find out where the studies and they called me back and they said hey
[02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:35.220]  tough luck go find your own studies so here it is the ADA doesn't even have one
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:39.980]  study that shows the fluoride in the drinking water lowers cavities so we
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:45.680]  have is Harvard three years ago looked at 25 and every one of them found
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:49.500]  IQ reduction you name it and then we have hundreds of studies on bone cancer we
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:54.300]  have it all yep those are substantiated and it's at those specific it lowers IQ
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:58.180]  more in certain populations I'd rather have rotten teeth and a high IQ but look
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:15:01.860]  my dad's a dentist it's true pharmaceutical grade fluoride will
[02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:05.820]  strengthen your teeth topically it's toxic but I'll be honest I still get
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:09.100]  fluoride treatments and I have great teeth but I'll get them every few years
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:12.420]  and I spit it all out and I get a headache afterwards but it's something I
[02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:17.220]  do I don't though ingest it every day look when I put sunscreen on I use
[02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:22.140]  organic and I also don't drink it that's like fluoride I mean why would you
[02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:26.580]  drink sunscreen to stop getting sunburn yeah especially considering it's never
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:30.820]  been proven to be effective never and yet they're putting it in everybody's
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:35.340]  water well I tell you listen I can sit here and dominate discussions as you
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:37.980]  know David but you're an amazing guy to talk to behind the scenes your good
[02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:41.980]  friends and Anthony good you already you've helped us so much and in four
[02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:45.340]  wars a life comm I was flattered learn that you're a listener and follow the
[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:50.620]  show where do you want to begin giving people the inside and you're not even
[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:54.500]  your major CEO we're gonna get into your company here you know like oh yours is
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:57.860]  the best or whatever even though it is we're just gonna look at the angle of
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:02.780]  as an insider the secrets of the nutraceutical vitamin system the
[02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:07.380]  outside codex olementarius attempted takeover I would look at it from the
[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:10.900]  governments and corporations trying to shut it down and then what's happening
[02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:14.420]  inside of it as well yeah you know Alex we're lucky that we could even buy these
[02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:18.780]  supplements because they do want to shut it down we are a major competition to
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:23.060]  Big Pharma and because we actually have better products if you look at the Big
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:26.900]  Pharma find me a great product that Big Pharma has they don't have any same
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:31.340]  Johnsworth WebMD 20 years ago what double better than Prozac and double blind
[02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:34.540]  studies exactly without the side effects it doesn't turn you into a
[02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:39.660]  homicidal maniac imagine that it's even safe you know it's safe for almost
[02:16:39.660 --> 02:16:44.580]  everybody and it's a fact that mother nature had something better yep and you
[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:48.540]  know it's great to see this platform because health freedom and political
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:52.820]  freedom go hand-in-hand if you don't have the political freedom to treat your
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:56.700]  own body then you've really lost your freedom and that's what's really great
[02:16:56.700 --> 02:17:00.540]  about the show is that you're constantly promoting both political freedom and
[02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:05.100]  health freedom they go hand-in-hand and to all the listeners out there as this
[02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:08.580]  thing starts to wind up the government is going to come after our supplements
[02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:12.060]  they've done it before and they'll do it again well they admit they've got all
[02:17:12.060 --> 02:17:15.660]  these attorney generals lining up with the feds to do it but they say I mean
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:19.300]  I've had folks on from Codex Alimentarius explain to folks what that is
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:23.260]  because people people go to UN once our supplements yes in Europe they've
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:27.300]  already lowered the allowances of what you can even get in jack-top prices yeah
[02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:32.580]  well thanks to Bill Clinton he signed all his codex and and NAFTA which makes
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:36.700]  international guidelines to what you can supply so people in Europe are going
[02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:41.060]  to say you can only have 10 milligrams of vitamin C that's the limit so they're
[02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:44.100]  going to make it worldwide you won't be able to get a vitamin C more than 10
[02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:48.700]  milligrams if that's what they decide in Belgium and then it makes it impossible
[02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:51.940]  to be a mass producer and sell to a bunch of countries because everyone's
[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:56.180]  different through a global treaty yep and meanwhile the whole world is buying
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:18:00.220]  US supplements you know the Chinese market is expanding quickly right now
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:04.900]  and people consumers in China they want American-made supplements because they're
[02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:08.340]  the highest quality in the world because we it's kind of a good that we get
[02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:12.740]  harassed by the FDA because it makes us the best exactly well you know I work
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:16.100]  with a lot of California companies and California has the highest standards for
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:19.540]  heavy metals and for general quality control so that's right when you test
[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:23.740]  the products yeah they're squeaky clean well we know we're a target anyway so
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:28.100]  that's why we go super neurotic yeah well you're doing a great job some of
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:30.820]  the products you have like your DNA force is one of the most advanced
[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:36.020]  nutraceutical products in the world and you guys didn't even yeah that's not
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:41.020]  even my product yeah I mean it really is expensive I mean yeah no you guys are
[02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:45.940]  on the cutting edge and and just supplying the information and and the
[02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:49.220]  products to go with it it's it's a it's a great place to buy your supplements
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:53.460]  well I mean number one I want to reap what I show but also we know we're
[02:18:53.460 --> 02:18:57.420]  targets so people can be guaranteed that we're having a triple tested yep
[02:18:57.420 --> 02:19:02.100]  absolutely and we've got all the filing cabinets ready and and everything done
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:05.580]  just right and you know everything with yellow tape on it we've got all the
[02:19:05.580 --> 02:19:09.500]  were every neurotic rule and the lawyers and the site and we're trying to do a

[02:24:20.900 --> 02:24:25.180]  got the floor because during the breaks you are really breaking it down amazing
[02:24:25.180 --> 02:24:30.140]  intel information you were telling me the wars here the next big wave that we
[02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:34.260]  see every eight nine years to restrict supplements and health freedom along with
[02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:38.300]  Obamacare this is the takeover of health care and one of the few growth
[02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:41.860]  industries in our country is supplements they're coming after it one of our only
[02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:46.060]  exports is supplements they're coming after our economy David break it down
[02:24:46.060 --> 02:24:49.380]  yeah we're really lucky to be able to buy these supplements here in America
[02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:53.020]  because a lot of countries you can't buy them Canada is really restricted and
[02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:57.220]  many places in Europe it's very very restricted and what you can buy so to
[02:24:57.220 --> 02:25:00.660]  be able to take your own responsibility look out for your own health care is
[02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:06.660]  really unique in America and something that we all have to fight to keep other
[02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:10.780]  big news you were just talking about prozac during the break yeah well you
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:13.340]  know if a wars breaks the news on prozac better than any other news
[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:16.540]  organization every time there's one of these mass murders you know it the guys
[02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:22.180]  on some form of of anti-depressant or SSRI drug and you know I was telling
[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:25.380]  Alex during the break that you know they've got the prozac up on the screen
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:30.540]  right here and prozac was one of the number one anti-depressants but it
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:35.740]  doesn't work it's not that clinically effective on normal depression so you
[02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:39.380]  get addicted to this stuff you can't get off of it and you go to the doctor
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:43.740]  since he can't get you off the prozac he puts you on a billify and a billify is
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:47.780]  now the number one drug in the world if you look up on the drug charts they're
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:51.740]  selling more billify than anything well you know the insert in prozac says it'll
[02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:55.380]  turn you into a homicidal maniac well they've never studied what's going to
[02:25:55.380 --> 02:25:59.460]  happen when you take a billify with the prozac and that's what we're seeing so
[02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:03.260]  much crazy violence in the world today sure we got 20% of the public on some
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:08.780]  type of this class of stuff and it's only growing but since you mentioned that
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:12.900]  a month ago the Washington Post reported there's a move to pass laws where
[02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:15.980]  they don't have to put this in the inserts anymore so now they won't even
[02:26:15.980 --> 02:26:19.580]  tell us it'll make you kill people yeah you know it's like the flu and sir I was
[02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:24.180]  just talking to Anthony about it and the flu insert inside the flu insert that
[02:26:24.180 --> 02:26:29.780]  they give you says that this has been shown to be clinically ineffective to
[02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:33.620]  stop the flu in the insert they're giving you the flu shot and they're
[02:26:33.620 --> 02:26:37.420]  telling you it doesn't work right in their own materials I don't know how
[02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:41.460]  that's like a WWF ticket or WWE ticket tells you it's all an act but people
[02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:44.140]  still think it's real yeah we think it actually probably
[02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:48.180]  increases the frequency of flu well that's what the study shows it doubles
[02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:51.340]  it yeah it doubles it so of course they can't tell you it's good for it so they
[02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:55.100]  want to keep this information away from you same way they want to get rid of the
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:59.540]  warnings in the commercials that you see on TV yeah that's the yeah I mean aren't
[02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:03.220]  we sick of hearing these drug commercials you can't advertise liquor or
[02:27:03.220 --> 02:27:07.860]  cigarettes get the prescription drug commercials off the TV don't you agree
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:11.340]  absolutely well and there it'll show some woman really happy but it'll go
[02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:15.340]  cause a stroke death heart attacks or may make you kill people or make you I
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:18.500]  mean it may make you sleepwalk I mean you it's like you know why would I want
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:22.580]  to take this or ask your doctor shouldn't your doctor be asking you what
[02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:26.980]  you need instead of you asking a doctor give me this drug the crazy thing is I've
[02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:30.100]  talked to medical doctors when I get checkups and I'll say can I have this
[02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:34.220]  can I have that they're like yeah yeah I mean it's crazy well they're drug
[02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:41.180]  pushers and they're like that's what they're there for 15 minutes they'll
[02:27:41.180 --> 02:27:44.620]  sell you some drugs and even you know some of the top drugs in the world today
[02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:50.300]  like the statin drugs for Lipitor for lowering cholesterol well Lipitor and
[02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:54.180]  these other cholesterol lowering drugs don't lower the chance for heart
[02:27:54.180 --> 02:28:01.260]  attack or stroke in the normal population 1% 0 not even 1% reduction in
[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:05.020]  heart attack or stroke so everybody out there that's on one of these statin
[02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:08.380]  drugs the reason you're taking it is so you don't have a heart attack or stroke
[02:28:08.380 --> 02:28:11.860]  but it's not effective it doesn't work and their own inserts say that that's
[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:15.500]  what's crazy I've had so many medical doctors on the point out Alzheimer's is
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:19.580]  going up for a lot of reasons but the big one is your brain is made up of
[02:28:19.580 --> 02:28:23.900]  cholesterol absolutely well something like 80% of the solid part is it's
[02:28:23.900 --> 02:28:27.940]  mainly water but the solid parts mainly oil and so you're taking something that
[02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:32.180]  suppresses that goodbye brain yeah well you got Joe Alicon here telling the
[02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:36.660]  Alzheimer's people to eat 18 eggs a day well that that's probably smart well my
[02:28:36.660 --> 02:28:40.100]  my uncle was in a motorcycle accident I love motorcycles but God are they
[02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:43.820]  dangerous and you know he went from being a super smart guy was gonna be a
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:50.780]  professional baseball player he was like 16 17 to horrible seizures well finally
[02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:55.900]  got a doctor 20 years ago that said eat steaks eat eggs you need fat and it made
[02:28:55.900 --> 02:29:00.500]  most of it go away yeah better than the drugs was just he sits there and eats
[02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:04.420]  like eight eggs a day you know another great example of this is I know people
[02:29:04.420 --> 02:29:10.140]  that have had extreme nerve pain headaches disassociations confusion
[02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:13.260]  depression and they don't know what's wrong with them and I'll look at them
[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:18.180]  and ask one question are you drinking diet soda oh yeah I drink two or three
[02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:23.140]  six what alcohol yeah it's what alcohol it will make you brain dead the stuff you
[02:29:23.140 --> 02:29:27.060]  go to your MD they'll send you to 20 neurologists not one of them will ask
[02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:31.380]  you are you drinking diet so Glenn Beck was having ocular degeneration that they
[02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:34.940]  admit aspartame you know what alcohol makes you blind and he made a big joke
[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:38.780]  about it said I don't want your help yep and I was just like hey Glenn I put an
[02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:42.980]  article up drudge link to it here's some stories about it making you blind you
[02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:46.860]  drink Diet Coke stop it yep with aspartame and he didn't want the help
[02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:49.540]  we're gonna come back and get into the very little secrets of vitamin
[02:29:49.540 --> 02:29:58.220]  companies March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:58.220 --> 02:30:03.260]  the reporters committee for freedom of the press and eight news media
[02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:06.780]  organizations have formed a coalition to demand that a federal court in North
[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:10.540]  Carolina unseal a Senate sing memorandum and related letters in the
[02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:14.260]  case of David Petraeus the court document says the public has an
[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:18.020]  especially strong interest in obtaining a full understanding but what did
[02:30:18.020 --> 02:30:22.780]  Petraeus leak seven black books that contained classified information
[02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:26.580]  regarding the identities of covert officers war strategy intelligence
[02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:30.820]  capabilities quotes and deliberative discussions from high-level national
[02:30:30.820 --> 02:30:34.300]  security council meetings but compare Petraeus's punishment to what John
[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:40.260]  Kiriakou a CIA officer who exposed the CIA's illegal torture program got the
[02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:44.540]  whistleblower got two years in jail for exposing government crime but the
[02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:48.300]  general who exposed information that really could have hurt national
[02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:53.140]  security got a fine equivalent to 75% of what he gets paid for a single speech
[02:30:53.140 --> 02:30:57.620]  and not two years in prison but two years probation foreverwars.com and

[02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:42.220]  political diversion we're going to be here tracking the entire situation David
[02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:46.900]  Breckler the vitamin man big industry insider is here and I know you're a
[02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:51.820]  classy guy you don't like to talk about about some people in the industry or
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:55.340]  whatever we're not going to name names but in the inside baseball and the
[02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:59.420]  almost daily discussions that you know we have with you and folks about how to
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:02.220]  have the best quality how to have groundbreaking things but also basic
[02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:06.820]  staples that truly organic stuff that's bioavailable people need to
[02:34:06.820 --> 02:34:10.300]  understand that it's going to be bad practices in the industry when the US is
[02:34:10.300 --> 02:34:16.540]  already the leader for quality that is going to end up letting the FDA come in
[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:23.020]  and try to shut down our health freedom so give people some of the secrets that
[02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:27.340]  are between true and junk supplements fake vitamins quality control and some of
[02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:32.260]  the secrets well some of the issues is that a lot of the raw materials that
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:36.860]  are being used nowadays are coming a powdered form so if a manufacturer
[02:34:36.860 --> 02:34:41.180]  receives a bag of a brown powder they've got to go through the work to
[02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:44.380]  identify it to make sure that it's it's the real thing that that's what they're
[02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:48.940]  looking for besides testing for adulterants heavy metals chemical
[02:34:48.940 --> 02:34:52.020]  residues and other things like that so it's an added cost everything's being
[02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:56.540]  tested over and over again that's why if something's cheap you can tell us not
[02:34:56.540 --> 02:35:00.260]  being tested absolutely the testing is the most important thing and a lot of
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:03.620]  these raw materials are coming from the third world you buy herbs from India
[02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:08.300]  from China they're coming from the third world so it needs that that foresight
[02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:13.060]  and oversight to make sure that these are actually what you're buying and that
[02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:16.340]  was part of the problem with the thing in New York they said that the people
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:20.340]  were selling herbs that weren't actually the herb but that doesn't even begin to
[02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:23.380]  address the issues of adulterants so you got to make sure you have the right
[02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:28.540]  herb to start with so I work with some of the top QA people in the world that do
[02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:32.140]  the testing to make sure that these are actually what you're buying and then we
[02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:37.020]  go further we test what you send again at the top labs in the country we have a
[02:35:37.020 --> 02:35:39.900]  bunch of them listed on it for us live.com and these people go man this is
[02:35:39.900 --> 02:35:43.780]  so clean yeah it's super important and that's why you've got to go with
[02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:47.660]  quality manufacturers and I don't want to be like to list one group that was
[02:35:47.660 --> 02:35:51.020]  down that launched Schwarzenegger was it Wender or whatever back in the 60s
[02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:54.660]  Weeder and they were the top thing in the world until they got caught with
[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:59.060]  fillers yeah and then I mean so also just from a business standpoint I don't
[02:35:59.060 --> 02:36:02.100]  ever want to have a problem because I'm in the media they're gonna come after
[02:36:02.100 --> 02:36:05.820]  me and then my business is done yeah I know that because I sell to you guys and
[02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:09.660]  and I know that's a top priority for you I mean I just don't get the common sense
[02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:12.940]  though it's good business to want to have the best quality absolutely and
[02:36:12.940 --> 02:36:16.020]  people will know it these products are effective they're they're experiential
[02:36:16.020 --> 02:36:19.220]  you take this stuff like your male product you know it works there's no
[02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:25.740]  doubt yeah absolutely it works a little too well Jackrabbit I'm sorry
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:30.500]  anyways go ahead I'm sorry yeah but you know buying from from you know
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:33.980]  legitimate companies and that goes back to what I was saying about people all
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:38.540]  over the world want supplements made in the USA because we have the highest
[02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:44.060]  standard for it and these companies that supply the raw materials are like big
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:47.500]  pharma companies except they're like the good guys they're selling the natural
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:51.500]  alternatives but they're ultra sophisticated you're dealing with very
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:56.300]  very high-end companies with with you know huge manufacturing factories in
[02:36:56.300 --> 02:37:00.580]  Germany and Italy all over the world well that's right you go to medical doctors
[02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:03.940]  now this is exciting you see whole areas where they're promoting
[02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:07.300]  nutraceuticals that you can only get from a doctor and it's the very stuff
[02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:12.540]  you are putting out in others just with a price tag three times exactly and and
[02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:16.220]  the products that you sell on your site are a great value and high quality
[02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:21.380]  there's no doubt about it it's amazing keep telling us the secrets well I mean
[02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:25.340]  a synthetic versus the real deal well you know you want you want to try to get
[02:37:25.340 --> 02:37:29.260]  your vitamins as natural and assimilable as possible obviously and things like
[02:37:29.260 --> 02:37:33.300]  your clonal silver I mean silver is a natural element there's nothing in there
[02:37:33.300 --> 02:37:37.300]  but silver and water that's about as basic and natural as you can get and
[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:42.100]  same with the herbs if you get something like your new child these product it has
[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:45.580]  some of the top herbal extractions in the world made by the top herbal
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:49.580]  extractor in the world so you're getting something that's that's totally pure it's
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:54.980]  efficacious it's high quality and it's it's it's the best you can get and I think
[02:37:54.980 --> 02:37:59.180]  you know something like the child these it's it's so important because you know
[02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:03.220]  we have a drug culture in this country we're putting people on Prozac even
[02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:06.860]  though it doesn't work we're fluoridated them even though it doesn't stop cavities
[02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:11.660]  and even worse than that we're putting small children on stimulant drugs in
[02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:15.660]  order to help them focus more but what you're offering now is a natural
[02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:19.420]  alternative to that that doesn't even better and it's healthy for well I don't
[02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:22.980]  use illegal drugs I don't even use a lot of prescription drugs other than like
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:27.140]  only release prescription drugs I had surgery and never even took the pain
[02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:32.860]  pills except the first two days but I did I guess it was like 15 years ago was
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:35.780]  talking to some folks that were prescribing into their kid they said
[02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:39.660]  you want to try one I guess it's Adderall yeah and I was speeding until
[02:38:39.660 --> 02:38:44.060]  like three in the morning woke up the next day felt the worst hangover of my
[02:38:44.060 --> 02:38:48.420]  life and I took a child dose of it just to literally see what it would do because
[02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:51.660]  I'm not a marijuana fan but I'll test it out once a year the stuff's incredible
[02:38:51.660 --> 02:38:55.460]  strong I'm for decriminalization but let me tell you this stuff's dangerous I
[02:38:55.460 --> 02:38:59.140]  mean it's it's I mean I was as medical marijuana uses it's an amazing plant but
[02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:02.980]  it's it's turned people into zombies and I've literally tested like the cops who
[02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:07.500]  just see what it's doing I can't believe that they were given this kid two of
[02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:12.300]  these pills a day he was like 11 years old he'd been on it for years and of
[02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:16.460]  course it calms them down because speed after a few months burns you out I
[02:39:16.460 --> 02:39:20.300]  mean talk about a zombie yeah but you know your child these product has go
[02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:25.180]  to coli in it and go to cola it has a similar effect it actually stimulates
[02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:29.260]  the forebrain and allows kids to focus better but meanwhile it has a lot of
[02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:32.580]  nerve tonics in it that actually strengthen and build the nervous system
[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:36.260]  for the kids so you're helping them in the long run yeah we've had adults here
[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:38.820]  that I haven't had I mean they was their idea but they're probably gonna endorse
[02:39:38.820 --> 02:39:42.700]  it who was kid dangles has been drinking it because he gets you know kind of
[02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:47.060]  hyper sometimes writing 15 hours a day he loves to write and he says this stuff
[02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:52.060]  really does focusing yeah parents tell us what's in childish well it's got a
[02:39:52.060 --> 02:39:58.220]  it's got a chamomile which is really soothing and really good for kids it has
[02:39:58.220 --> 02:40:02.820]  glasses on me but uh well you know what's in it I can maybe a bit in a small
[02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:09.860]  print chamomile flour what is that jubu seed yeah jubu seed Hawthorne berry
[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:14.820]  Hawthorne berry is is really effective in in smoothing out the heart so a lot of
[02:40:14.820 --> 02:40:18.380]  hyperactive kids have actually accelerated heart rates so the Hawthorne
[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:22.220]  berry will actually calm their heart down a little bit and it also a lot of
[02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:26.940]  times for kids they're perceiving the world as being maybe a
[02:40:26.940 --> 02:40:32.220]  threatening scary place when it's not so they might get anxious about going to
[02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:36.860]  school when they shouldn't be so a lot of the herbs in here actually help a kid
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:41.420]  to perceive the world in a more wholesome and healthy absolutely well
[02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:45.500]  none of our ancestors rode down the road at 75 miles an hour none of them dealt
[02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:48.940]  with all this craziness and so genetically we're not really ready for
[02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:53.700]  this what's a catnip aerial parts when you hear aerial parts what does that mean
[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:57.940]  the catnip is is just the flowering parts of the catnip even though catnip
[02:40:57.940 --> 02:41:02.540]  stimulates you know cats it actually has the opposite effect on children lemon
[02:41:02.540 --> 02:41:06.740]  balm it's soothing also although that's another nerve tonic that actually sues
[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:13.460]  the nervous system long pepper fruit that's you know a lot of kids end up
[02:41:13.460 --> 02:41:16.420]  with digestive problems because they're nervous they're anxious about going to
[02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:21.100]  school they're anxious just coping with being a human being so they need things
[02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:24.500]  that actually soothe their digestive system is that licorice root I mean yeah
[02:41:24.500 --> 02:41:32.900]  and licorice also sues the sues the digestion system Alma fruit Alma is a is a great
[02:41:32.900 --> 02:41:39.100]  source of vitamin C but it also has a lot of phenols and tannins in it and
[02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:43.260]  helps with digestion as well magnesium and I'm gonna pronounce this wrong
[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:47.860]  tarnate yeah magnesium is just also calming it's good for the nervous system
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:53.100]  again child ease is a nerve tonic it will improve the nervous system of the
[02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:58.860]  shoulder calcium carbonate also call me for the nervous system go to cola go to
[02:41:58.860 --> 02:42:02.540]  cola that's the thing you see when you drink coca-cola that's where the cola
[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:08.220]  comes from from go to cola so riddle in actually simulates the way that that
[02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:13.020]  cocaine works it works in the same dopamine pathways so instead we're
[02:42:13.020 --> 02:42:17.740]  using something that's gentle natural the go to cola has a very similar effect
[02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:24.540]  without coke and cola you don't have cocaine no you have go to cola well it's
[02:42:24.540 --> 02:42:30.140]  the healthy natural alternative and it helps kids focus and I'll tell you you
[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:34.260]  do not want your kids on these drugs oh my gosh other little zombies your parent

[02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:03.460]  silver silver silver it seems like they couldn't beat it so they joined it yeah
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:07.860]  well we're getting all these really hard to fight bacterias like MRSA and
[02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:12.220]  they're finding that topical application of simple things like silver and even
[02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:17.300]  honey are more effective than anything else they have I had a sore throat and
[02:44:17.300 --> 02:44:20.460]  one of my family members did as well and we went in we got checked it was
[02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:23.740]  bacterial and I don't recommend this for everybody talk to your physician it is
[02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:28.220]  toxic and high levels I took a lot more than what's recommended and just yeah
[02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:32.220]  well colloidal silver is amazing when it's used topically if you put it on a
[02:44:32.220 --> 02:44:37.700]  on a sore I gargle gargle with it it's the most effective that way now
[02:44:37.700 --> 02:44:41.740]  obviously there I guess if you drink 20 bottles of it for you know six months

[02:44:48.020 --> 02:44:52.940]  good yeah I had read that that wasn't true at 30 parts no it's not 30 parts
[02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:56.660]  per million is a conservative dose there's a lot of these machines on the
[02:44:56.660 --> 02:44:59.820]  market that you can make your own colloidal silver and in our opinion they're
[02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:03.460]  dangerous and that's why it shouldn't be over 30 parts exactly explain to people
[02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:07.940]  well originally the studies were done at about 10 parts per million so it
[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:12.140]  doesn't take more parts per million to make it effective stronger isn't better
[02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:16.940]  actually in the 10 to 30 parts range is perfect and that's what I've talked to
[02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:20.900]  the top medical folks they've said that in fact a lot of we have insurance all
[02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:23.940]  this as well major insurance company I have like one of the biggest in the
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:28.220]  world the one that insured ships famously and they said we will not insure
[02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:31.940]  over 30 parts yeah I wouldn't use it I don't think you need it and I think it
[02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:35.060]  could have problems if you if you took too much it was just funny how they even
[02:45:35.060 --> 02:45:38.180]  knew well if you get one of these homemade machines and you turn it on you
[02:45:38.180 --> 02:45:42.500]  could have a million parts per million how would you know you don't you it's
[02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:44.820]  never been tested well they're cool machines you stick them in you can see
[02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:48.140]  it coming off but man yeah you're actually yeah the colloidal silver I
[02:45:48.140 --> 02:45:52.540]  would I would buy it and and you know the people we get it from for the
[02:45:52.540 --> 02:45:56.420]  info wars it's the oldest silver company in the work in the country and I
[02:45:56.420 --> 02:45:59.820]  hear it's like super space age when they do it it's like super dangerous too right
[02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:03.740]  that's like electricity that shoots through and yeah like dr. Frankenstein's
[02:46:03.740 --> 02:46:08.780]  laboratory something like that well you know the minerals are just amazing in
[02:46:08.780 --> 02:46:11.620]  general and then that's something that everybody's realizing more and more
[02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:16.620]  gold is incredible it has amazing properties so does silver silver is the
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:19.900]  best conductor in the world that's why they're using it for all the micro
[02:46:19.900 --> 02:46:25.580]  circuitries it's better than gold so I think and what does it do when it gets
[02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:29.820]  the virus for bacteria it disables them it stops the the bacteria from being
[02:46:29.820 --> 02:46:34.060]  able to replicate so that's it you get one bacteria it dies it doesn't make a
[02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:37.140]  baby and so the particle just goes through I'm told kind of like a bullet it
[02:46:37.140 --> 02:46:41.180]  just goes I'm not sure exactly the method of action but we wouldn't you know in
[02:46:41.180 --> 02:46:45.260]  the in vitro studies when they take Petri dishes full of bacteria they'll
[02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:49.700]  squirt the colloidal silver in there and it's good by bacteria it kills it on
[02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:54.940]  contact yeah it's an amazing product well I've got the articles here they're
[02:46:54.940 --> 02:46:58.140]  saying that they believe that drug-resistant bacteria are gonna be
[02:46:58.140 --> 02:47:01.660]  the new plague yeah well that's why you're seeing all these companies now
[02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:06.740]  want to stop giving their chickens antibiotics because it it's you know
[02:47:06.740 --> 02:47:10.540]  there's no end to it if they're just creating stronger and stronger bugs well
[02:47:10.540 --> 02:47:14.260]  I mean things should be too extreme the whole animal rights movement is being
[02:47:14.260 --> 02:47:17.860]  pushed by eugenicists at the top to take humans rights away and let
[02:47:17.860 --> 02:47:21.780]  governments claim that they represent the animals just to basically say look
[02:47:21.780 --> 02:47:25.500]  you're outvoted by the chickens but I've been in these factory farms I've got
[02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:28.300]  a family that's in farming in these Texas they're not in this but I've been
[02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:32.100]  inside a turkey farm and I've been inside a smaller chicken farm that was
[02:47:32.100 --> 02:47:37.060]  considered humane hellish yeah and I don't want to eat something that's been
[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:40.700]  through stuff like this it just it just sounds like bad karma to me just at a
[02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:44.540]  gut level I'm like whoa we need to treat them humanely or we won't be treated
[02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:48.260]  humanely it's gonna come back on us and then you feed them antibiotics and
[02:47:48.260 --> 02:47:51.420]  steroids and all this stuff so they could sit there with mites all over them
[02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:55.780]  and cut their beak soft so they don't kill themselves these chickens but the
[02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:59.860]  big ties in farms and others are so unhappy they de-beak them when they're
[02:47:59.860 --> 02:48:04.260]  little or the or the birds will kill themselves I mean I don't want you an
[02:48:04.260 --> 02:48:08.700]  animal that was in a torture pit for six months no neither do I no that's why
[02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:13.380]  you know you were talking about natural and organic natural and organic is the
[02:48:13.380 --> 02:48:18.460]  biggest growing financial sector in the world right now everybody's getting
[02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:21.540]  getting hip to it so isn't this a giant victory and sure they're gonna have
[02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:24.820]  counterfeits and clones there's gonna be problems but the fact that voting with
[02:48:24.820 --> 02:48:29.020]  our dollars is changing everything shows the power of the people yeah well
[02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:32.700]  here we are in Austin Texas a home of whole foods this is this is an epic
[02:48:32.700 --> 02:48:36.940]  center up for it if you're smart if you're affluent you want high quality
[02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:40.700]  pure food exactly the most educated area in the country is is a free at which
[02:48:40.700 --> 02:48:44.820]  county I saw a little years ago it's the highest educated county per capita
[02:48:44.820 --> 02:48:49.060]  around San Francisco I forget which one and it's the highest Novak's rate yeah
[02:48:49.060 --> 02:48:52.100]  these people all have PhDs are not why because they've done they've read the
[02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:56.580]  literature yeah and they're liberals yeah absolutely they're well like you
[02:48:56.580 --> 02:49:00.660]  said liberal means to be educated and and and that's what it comes from books to
[02:49:00.660 --> 02:49:04.420]  read if you read and you do your own research you don't want to drink tap
[02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:08.260]  water why would you what would you call them the new fake fascist liberal that
[02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:16.060]  works with the fascist conservative annoying yeah you know I think you do a
[02:49:16.060 --> 02:49:19.660]  great job at exposing the right left paradigm you know you meet the new boss
[02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:23.220]  same as the old boss it's the right left paradigm what you've got to do is your
[02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:26.940]  own research look at some of the stuff we've talked about today look at the
[02:49:26.940 --> 02:49:31.300]  thing with I said about the ADA and the fluoride of the water show me the study
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:36.420]  read it where are the studies on on on the statin drugs lowering your chance
[02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:40.380]  for a heart attack or stroke they don't have them it doesn't work and look it up
[02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:45.100]  that national media go Jones is a liar and claims that flu shots can kill you
[02:49:45.100 --> 02:49:50.020]  and then it's in the insert it can kill you and then they say in the news there
[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:54.660]  is no side effects safe and effective you get the insert and it's like a the
[02:49:54.660 --> 02:49:58.300]  chapter of the Bible I mean it's in it's on Bible paper and you unfold it
[02:49:58.300 --> 02:50:01.780]  there's just like a whole page of side effects yeah but it says right in the
[02:50:01.780 --> 02:50:06.620]  insert that it doesn't work that's right that right in fact the HPV shot says
[02:50:06.620 --> 02:50:10.660]  it's not proven to protect you from the papilloma yep look everybody out there
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:14.140]  you have to take responsibility for your own health they're not going to do it
[02:50:14.140 --> 02:50:17.500]  for you you've got to look into this stuff you've got to take care of your
[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:21.220]  health you have to supplement and you have to live a good healthy life it's
[02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:24.620]  the number one gift you have is your health and you have to work at protecting
[02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:28.580]  it absolutely when we come back I want to give you the floor whatever you want
[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:31.020]  to talk about I've got a hundred questions but a little six-minute
[02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:35.020]  segment I want to ask David Breckler what he wants to get into a natural
[02:50:35.020 --> 02:50:38.220]  approach versus big pharma how mainstream medicine was made popular
[02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:42.180]  maybe we should hit that when we come back and then mainstream medicines failure
[02:50:42.180 --> 02:50:46.700]  listen I went to a chiropractor but I've been shooting a 50 calhand held they
[02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:50.340]  fixed my back when medical doctors said they had to do surgery but then for a
[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:53.460]  hernia I went to a surgeon he did a great job we're not saying they're all
[02:50:53.460 --> 02:50:57.180]  villains but but more and more they're moving in a direction to create a
[02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:03.300]  monopoly stay with us it's very easy to be a criminal all you need to burglarize
[02:51:03.300 --> 02:51:08.180]  a home is one simple household tool a pair of scissors if your home security
[02:51:08.180 --> 02:51:12.220]  system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors then you're making it
[02:51:12.220 --> 02:51:16.380]  easy for them almost every home security system even though sold by big name
[02:51:16.380 --> 02:51:21.540]  companies has a weakness the phone line you shell out 1500 bucks get locked into
[02:51:21.540 --> 02:51:25.980]  a long-term contract and think you're safe but a burglar can destroy your
[02:51:25.980 --> 02:51:30.260]  alarm in seconds with one snip and when a burglar cuts your phone line you're

[02:52:04.740 --> 02:52:07.820]  spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[02:52:07.820 --> 02:52:11.900]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[02:52:11.900 --> 02:52:16.260]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music
[02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:20.860]  fast food GMOs sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their
[02:52:20.860 --> 02:52:25.540]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[02:52:25.540 --> 02:52:29.100]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:33.220]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:36.300]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take
[02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:40.020]  we worked with the lean manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe
[02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:43.540]  for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula
[02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:48.380]  out there introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile

[02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:29.300]  we're gonna do five minutes overdrive because they just brought in the insert
[02:54:29.300 --> 02:54:34.020]  and my guest David Breckler wants to find the section that highlighted here
[02:54:34.020 --> 02:54:39.660]  somewhere or underlined where they go on to say that it doesn't actually protect
[02:54:39.660 --> 02:54:43.620]  you and hasn't been proven I've got where they say it gives you diabetes and can
[02:54:43.620 --> 02:54:47.740]  kill you and everything else so we'll cover some of that in the next segment
[02:54:47.740 --> 02:54:54.500]  finishing up how does mainstream medicine how did it take over the
[02:54:54.500 --> 02:54:58.940]  original health conspiracy and mainstream medicines failure to address the root
[02:54:58.940 --> 02:55:03.300]  issue with toxic medicines yeah that's a great question Alex you know the turn
[02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:07.900]  of the century there were three main medical systems in America allopathic
[02:55:07.900 --> 02:55:12.620]  medicine but there was osteopathic medicine and homeopathic medicine I'm
[02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:16.740]  sure a lot of your listeners are aware of all those kinds of medicine but like
[02:55:16.740 --> 02:55:20.860]  all the other conspiracies that you cover Carnegie one of the big financial
[02:55:20.860 --> 02:55:26.140]  guys decided that look there's no future in homeopathy or osteopathy the future
[02:55:26.140 --> 02:55:30.660]  is an allopathic medicine and that's what they decided that they wanted it to
[02:55:30.660 --> 02:55:35.820]  run with so they went around the country and they investigated who were the top
[02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:40.540]  allopathic doctors in the world in the country and they went around to every one
[02:55:40.540 --> 02:55:45.260]  of them and networked with them and then they started to build the medical
[02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:50.620]  colleges the medical schools in order to train the doctors to sell their
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:55.620]  allopathic medicines now if you look at allopathic medicine every single one of
[02:55:55.620 --> 02:56:00.460]  them is toxic if you take too much of them you're gonna get sick or die that's
[02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:05.700]  what allopathic medicine is we say back at the office that it's the slash burn
[02:56:05.700 --> 02:56:10.260]  and poison form of medicine and you're right if you get hurt or you have some
[02:56:10.260 --> 02:56:14.540]  kind of serious acute issue go to the hospital go to the doctor that's what
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:18.460]  they're best at but if you've got a chronic condition do not treat it through
[02:56:18.460 --> 02:56:22.620]  allopathic medicine it will not work there's no end to the drug therapy that
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:26.420]  they give they told me a chiropractor cannot fix you and I saw the x-rays the
[02:56:26.420 --> 02:56:30.820]  chiropractor in three visits got my back back in line yeah so meanwhile the drug
[02:56:30.820 --> 02:56:34.260]  companies are funding the medical schools and they're turning the doctors
[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:38.620]  into drug pushers that's their number one job and like I said before they're
[02:56:38.620 --> 02:56:41.660]  even really getting rid of surgeries and MD type stuff and going right to just
[02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:46.420]  drugs yep and even if you have you know a severe condition like diabetes which
[02:56:46.420 --> 02:56:50.380]  can be controlled with diet and with with basic minerals they don't they don't
[02:56:50.380 --> 02:56:54.980]  offer you that advice they they give you very Ray Kurzweil has reversed his type
[02:56:54.980 --> 02:56:59.340]  to he's an establishment guy with diet with diet and with supplementation you
[02:56:59.340 --> 02:57:02.660]  can do it again it comes down to taking responsibility for your own health if
[02:57:02.660 --> 02:57:07.260]  you've got a chronic condition don't expect the doctor or the medical system
[02:57:07.260 --> 02:57:11.140]  to resolve that for you in the long run you know I've heard Huckabee now is
[02:57:11.140 --> 02:57:15.340]  promoting what's what's known to be able to stabilize as you said he said he can
[02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:21.460]  be reversed a hundred percent he's how how can he get away with that I guess he
[02:57:21.460 --> 02:57:24.700]  just thinks it's known enough now that he's willing to say it and get you
[02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:28.940]  governor Huckabee does add saying they can cure diabetes oh right yeah well
[02:57:28.940 --> 02:57:33.740]  not saying that yeah I haven't seen it you know and I just think it's it's
[02:57:33.740 --> 02:57:37.180]  wild that he's an insider and he's doing that yeah it's like the it's like the
[02:57:37.180 --> 02:57:40.740]  statin thing are you gonna take statin for two months and now you're your
[02:57:40.740 --> 02:57:44.820]  cholesterol is under control no it'll never be under control and the fact is
[02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:50.420]  cholesterol is not the key factor when it comes to coronary heart disease it has
[02:57:50.420 --> 02:57:54.700]  very little to do with it it's in coronary heart disease is multifaceted
[02:57:54.700 --> 02:57:58.420]  and it has a lot of causes and a lot of ways to treat it well isn't like these
[02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:01.140]  young college basketball players that kept dying and they found out they were

[03:00:06.980 --> 03:00:13.500]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network final
[03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:16.580]  segment with David Breckler I don't want to exhaust him if he wants to come on the
[03:00:16.580 --> 03:00:20.900]  nightly news if you welcome do that as well amazing guy he was wanting the flu
[03:00:20.900 --> 03:00:24.380]  shot insert to show where it admits it doesn't protect you from the flu but
[03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:28.220]  instead we brought in the the one we had on hand was the MMR shot where it says
[03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:34.140]  quote it can give you pancreitis diarrhea vomiting diabetes the writer
[03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:38.540]  diabetes it just goes on and on it admits it can kill you we've covered
[03:00:38.540 --> 03:00:42.940]  this a lot but if you just search government admits flu shot doesn't
[03:00:42.940 --> 03:00:46.380]  protect you from flu just a few months ago was all over the news they said you
[03:00:46.380 --> 03:00:50.620]  know what it doesn't protect you it's on the insert get the insert if you ever
[03:00:50.620 --> 03:00:55.900]  get a vaccine ask the doctor for the insert and read about it you've got to
[03:00:55.900 --> 03:00:59.020]  do your own work you got if the vaccines really worked to protect it me I
[03:00:59.020 --> 03:01:03.460]  would be taking them yeah I mean and my wife's a nurse and they make her take it
[03:01:03.460 --> 03:01:07.900]  she gets sick right after she gets the flu shot yeah there's the CBS spin flu
[03:01:07.900 --> 03:01:11.620]  vaccine proves far less effective than usual but what they actually admitted was
[03:01:11.620 --> 03:01:17.340]  it did nothing but then they spin it to far less effective yeah you know the
[03:01:17.340 --> 03:01:21.460]  natural way is always the better way to go start with good food good water take
[03:01:21.460 --> 03:01:25.900]  some supplements get some exercise think positive and try to avoid the doctors
[03:01:25.900 --> 03:01:29.100]  much as you possibly can the reason they're gonna lose their war for force
[03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:34.300]  inoculation we see in Australia and California is because the Prime Minister
[03:01:34.300 --> 03:01:37.900]  himself Abbott not our governor but their Prime Minister his daughters don't
[03:01:37.900 --> 03:01:41.580]  take it he was quoted in the news a few years ago in the Australian saying
[03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:45.460]  he doesn't take it so and then the elites have their own special cleaner
[03:01:45.460 --> 03:01:50.900]  vaccines that they're taking but plus everybody I almost know took the flu
[03:01:50.900 --> 03:01:54.860]  shot at one time and got deathly ill yeah well I haven't had the flu shot in
[03:01:54.860 --> 03:01:58.620]  20 years I haven't had the flu in 20 years there's homeopathic medicines out
[03:01:58.620 --> 03:02:02.580]  there that help you you know increase your immunity to the flu oh Rob do you
[03:02:02.580 --> 03:02:06.740]  found it Rob I found it right here all right influence the flu virus you can
[03:02:06.740 --> 03:02:09.900]  read it right there let me see it I'm gonna put it on here just the document
[03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:13.940]  comes right here do show me limitations of vaccines effectiveness
[03:02:13.940 --> 03:02:19.620]  yeah vaccination with floors flu zone vaccine may not protect all recipients
[03:02:19.620 --> 03:02:23.180]  well there's even more extreme warning we'll get it for you we'll have you
[03:02:23.180 --> 03:02:26.460]  posted on the website yeah well the Gardasil one is it doesn't protect you
[03:02:26.460 --> 03:02:31.220]  let's see who makes this one is this the swab up one
[03:02:31.220 --> 03:02:35.900]  I always send a TNT email but we forgot to get it yeah we'll get it yeah well
[03:02:35.900 --> 03:02:42.820]  you know also about fluoride go on the internet and search show me the study
[03:02:42.820 --> 03:02:47.900]  where oral ingestation of fluoride reduces dental cavities find that and
[03:02:47.900 --> 03:02:52.380]  then realize they're putting it in everybody's water and it doesn't even
[03:02:52.380 --> 03:02:56.100]  work what they've actually found is especially in development it goes up in
[03:02:56.100 --> 03:03:01.140]  the bloodstream and gets up into the roots and creates calcification actually
[03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:04.820]  weakens the teeth and the bones yeah well it doesn't fracture it dumps you down
[03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:09.620]  causes fractures all that's proven it lowers IQ that's been proven seven
[03:03:09.620 --> 03:03:13.220]  fold increase in bone cancer and men yeah and you look at something also that
[03:03:13.220 --> 03:03:17.380]  upsets me is do you think the government and these rich people in the world
[03:03:17.380 --> 03:03:22.420]  care about poor children's teeth no course they don't care about them one bit
[03:03:22.420 --> 03:03:25.900]  they want to dump them down and they want to lower their IQ and they want to
[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:29.700]  make them passive and get billions a year on toxic waste they have to store
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:34.860]  exactly exactly yeah what better place to put it we pay to have them fire
[03:03:34.860 --> 03:03:39.820]  fluoride bullets in our children's brains yep well I'm really impressed with
[03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:43.820]  the work you're doing and and the help you've given us David I just cannot we
[03:03:43.820 --> 03:03:48.460]  didn't get to all these questions but tonight if you'll do 15 minutes on the
[03:03:48.460 --> 03:03:53.220]  news I'm going back to understand what we can tape it for the news okay I want
[03:03:53.220 --> 03:03:56.980]  you to answer the question how to identify if you're being sold junk we
[03:03:56.980 --> 03:04:02.020]  use one of the top herbal identifiers in the world how do you tell that yeah well
[03:04:02.020 --> 03:04:07.100]  you know there's there's DNA testing but there's also advanced testing so some
[03:04:07.100 --> 03:04:10.260]  of the herbs that go into these products have been tested three or four or five
[03:04:10.260 --> 03:04:15.140]  different methods of testing I'm not a QA expert in the different methodologies
[03:04:15.140 --> 03:04:20.060]  but I know that one test doesn't do it all it's not as simple as a DNA test and
[03:04:20.060 --> 03:04:24.180]  that's why the the district attorney of New York made the big blunder by using
[03:04:24.180 --> 03:04:28.140]  the DNA test and trying to say that all those herbs were bad they weren't there
[03:04:28.140 --> 03:04:32.300]  was a there was it was their testing methodology that was failed absolutely
[03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:36.340]  mean what's your spectrometers you name it you name it they use a lot of
[03:04:36.340 --> 03:04:40.620]  different high-tech equipment we have a huge lab we send things out it's very
[03:04:40.620 --> 03:04:45.380]  very sophisticated now wow it's simply amazing well David Reckler thank you so
